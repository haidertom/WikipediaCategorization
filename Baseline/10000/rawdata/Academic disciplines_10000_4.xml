'''Adaptive management''' ('''AM'''), also known as '''adaptive resource management''' ('''ARM''') or '''adaptive environmental assessment and management''' ('''AEAM'''), is a structured, [[iteration|iterative]] process of robust [[decision making]] in the face of [[uncertainty]], with an aim to reducing uncertainty over time via [[system monitoring]]. In this way, decision making simultaneously meets one or more [[resource management]] objectives and, either passively or actively, accrues information needed to improve future management. Adaptive management is a tool which should be used not only to change a system, but also to learn about the system.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive Environmental Assessment and Management|last=Holling|first=C.S.|publisher=John Wiley &amp;amp; Sons|year=1978|isbn=9781932846072|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because adaptive management is based on a learning process, it improves long-run management outcomes. The challenge in using the adaptive management approach lies in finding the correct balance between gaining knowledge to improve management in the future and achieving the best short-term outcome based on current knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=EMxPZu99B_MC#v=onepage&amp;amp;q&amp;amp;f=false|title=Adaptive Environmental Management: A Practitioner's Guide|last=Allan|first=Catherine|last2=Stankey|first2=George Henry|date=2009-06-05|publisher=Springer Science &amp;amp; Business Media|isbn=9781402096327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has more recently been employed in implementing [[international development]] programs.

==Objectives==
There are a number of scientific and social processes which are vital components of adaptive management, including:
* Management is linked to appropriate temporal and spatial scales
* Management retains a focus on [[statistical power]] and controls
* Use of computer models to build synthesis and an embodied ecological consensus
* Use of embodied ecological consensus to evaluate strategic alternatives
* Communication of alternatives to political arena for negotiation of a selection

The achievement of these objectives requires an open management process which seeks to include past, present and future [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]]. Adaptive management needs to at least maintain [[Glasnost|political openness]], but usually aims to create it. Adaptive management must therefore be a [[scientific]] and social process. It must focus on the development of new [[institutions]] and institutional strategies in balance with [[scientific hypothesis]] and experimental frameworks (resilliance.org).

Adaptive management can proceed as either passive or active adaptive management, depending on how learning takes place. Passive adaptive management values learning only insofar as it improves decision outcomes (i.e. passively), as measured by the specified utility function. In contrast, active adaptive management explicitly incorporates learning as part of the objective function, and hence, decisions which improve learning are valued over those which do not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Adaptive management of renewable resources|last=1944-|first=Walters, Carl J.|date=1986-01-01|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0029479704|oclc=13184654}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both cases, as new knowledge is gained, the models are updated and optimal management strategies are derived accordingly. Thus, while learning occurs in both cases, it is treated differently. Often, deriving actively adaptive policies is technically very difficult, which prevents it being more commonly applied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Gemma|last2=Crammond|first2=Brad|last3=Malbon|first3=Eleanor|last4=Carey|first4=Nic|date=2015-09-18|title=Adaptive Policies for Reducing Inequalities in the Social Determinants of Health|journal=International Journal of Health Policy and Management|volume=4|issue=11|pages=763–767|doi=10.15171/ijhpm.2015.170|issn=2322-5939|pmc=4629702|pmid=26673337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Key features of both passive and active adaptive management are:
*Iterative decision-making (evaluating results and adjusting actions on the basis of what has been learned)
*[[Feedback]] between monitoring and decisions (learning)
*Explicit characterization of system uncertainty through multi-model inference
*[[Bayesian inference]]
*Embracing [[risk]] and uncertainty as a way of building understanding

However, a number of process failures related to information feedback can prevent effective adaptive management decision making:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=L|first=Elzinga, Caryl|last2=W|first2=Salzer, Daniel|last3=W|first3=Willoughby, John|date=1998-01-01|title=Measuring &amp; Monitering Plant Populations|journal=U.s. Bureau of Land Management Papers|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/usblmpub/17/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[data collection]] is never completely implemented
* data are collected but not analyzed
* [[data analysis|data are analyzed]] but results are inconclusive
* data are analyzed and are interesting, but are not presented to decision makers
* data are analyzed and presented, but are not used for decision-making because of internal or external factors

==History==
The use of adaptive management techniques can be traced back to peoples from ancient civilisations. For example, the [[Yap]] people of Micronesia have been using adaptive management techniques to sustain high [[population density|population densities]] in the face of resource scarcity for thousands of years (Falanruw 1984). In using these techniques, the Yap people have altered their environment creating, for example, coastal [[mangrove]] depressions and [[seagrass]] meadows to support fishing and termite resistant wood (Stankey and Shinder 1997).

The origin of the adaptive management concept can be traced back to ideas of [[scientific management]] pioneered by [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]] in the early 1900s (Haber 1964). While the term "adaptive management" evolved in natural resource management workshops through decision makers, managers and scientists focussing on building simulation models to uncover key assumptions and uncertainties (Bormann ''et al.'' 1999)&lt;!-- ### This sentence is incomplete. Managagers and sci. did what? --&gt;

Two ecologists at The [[University of British Columbia]], [[C. S. Holling|C.S. Holling]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and C.J Walters&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; further developed the adaptive management approach as they distinguished between passive and active adaptive management practice. [[Kai Lee]], notable Princeton physicist, expanded upon the approach in the late 1970s and early 1980s while pursuing a post-doctorate degree at UC [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. The approach was further developed at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], while C.S. Holling was director of the Institute. In 1992, Hilbourne described three learning models for federal land managers, around which adaptive management approaches could be developed, these are reactive, passive and active.

Adaptive management has probably been most frequently applied in Yap, [[Australia]] and [[North America]], initially applied in [[fishery]] management, but received more broad application in the 1990s and 2000s. One of the most successful applications of adaptive management has been in the area of waterfowl harvest management in North America, most notably for the [[mallard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nichols|first=James D.|last2=Johnson|first2=Fred A.|last3=Williams|first3=Byron K.|last4=Boomer|first4=G. Scott|date=2015-06-01|title=On formally integrating science and policy: walking the walk|journal=Journal of Applied Ecology|language=en|volume=52|issue=3|pages=539–543|doi=10.1111/1365-2664.12406|issn=1365-2664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adaptive management in a conservation project and program context can trace its roots back to at least the early 1990s, with the establishment of the Biodiversity Support Program (BSP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/bsp/index.html Biodiversity Support Program]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1989.  BSP was a [http://www.usaid.gov/ USAID]-funded consortium of WWF&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldwildlife.org/ WWF]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nature Conservancy (TNC),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnc.org/ The Nature Conservancy]&lt;/ref&gt; and World Resources Institute (WRI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wri.org/ World Resources Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; Its Analysis and Adaptive Management Program sought to understand the conditions under which certain conservation strategies were most effective and to identify lessons learned across conservation projects.  When BSP ended in 2001, TNC and Foundations of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fosonline.org/ Foundations of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS, a non-profit which grew out of BSP) continued to actively work in promoting adaptive management for conservation projects and programs.  The approaches used included Conservation by Design&lt;ref&gt;[http://conserveonline.org/workspaces/cbdgateway/ Conservation by Design]&lt;/ref&gt; (TNC) and Measures of Success&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islandpress.org/ip/books/book/islandpress/M/bo3559851.html Measures of Success]&lt;/ref&gt; (FOS).

In 2004, the Conservation Measures Partnership (CMP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/ Conservation Measures Partnership]&lt;/ref&gt; – which includes several former BSP members – developed a common set of standards and guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management/ | title=Home}}&lt;/ref&gt; for applying adaptive management to conservation projects and programs.

==Use in environmental practices==
Applying adaptive management in a conservation project or program involves the integration of project/program design, management, and monitoring to systematically test assumptions in order to adapt and learn. The three components of adaptive management in environmental practice are:

*''Testing assumptions'' is about systematically trying different actions to achieve a desired outcome. It is not, however, a random trial-and-error process.  Rather, it involves using knowledge about the specific site to pick the best known strategy, laying out the assumptions behind how that strategy will work, and then collecting monitoring data to determine if the assumptions hold true.
*''Adaptation'' involves changing assumptions and interventions to respond to new or different information obtained through monitoring and project experience.
*''Learning'' is about explicitly documenting a team's planning and implementation processes and its successes and failures for internal learning as well as learning across the conservation community.  This learning enables conservation practitioners to design and manage projects better and avoid some of the perils others have encountered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stankey|first=George H.|last2=Clark|first2=Roger N.|last3=Bormann|first3=Bernard T.|last4=Stankey|first4=George H.|last5=Clark|first5=Roger N.|last6=Bormann|first6=Bernard T.|title=Adaptive management of natural resources: theory, concepts, and management institutions.|url=https://www.treesearch.fs.fed.us/pubs/20657/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Learning about a managed system is only useful in cases where management decisions are repeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rout|first=Tracy M.|last2=Hauser|first2=Cindy E.|last3=Possingham|first3=Hugh P.|date=2009-03-01|title=Optimal adaptive management for the translocation of a threatened species|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=515–526|doi=10.1890/07-1989.1|issn=1939-5582|pmid=19323207|url=http://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:181588/UQ181588_OA.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to environmental projects and programs==
[[Image:CMP Cycle - 2008-02-20.jpg|thumb|Figure 1: CMP Adaptive Management Cycle]]

''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationmeasures.org/initiatives/standards-for-project-management ''Open Standards for the Practice of Conservation'']&lt;/ref&gt; lays out five main steps to an adaptive management project cycle (see Figure 1).  The ''Open Standards'' represent a compilation and adaptation of best practices and guidelines across several fields and across several organizations within the conservation community.  Since the release of the initial ''Open Standards'' (updated in 2007 and 2013), thousands of project teams from conservation organizations (e.g., TNC, Rare, and WWF), local conservation groups, and donors alike have begun applying these ''Open Standards'' to their work.  In addition, several CMP members have developed training materials and courses to help apply the Standards.

Some recent write-ups of adaptive management in conservation include:  wildlife protection (SWAP, 2008), forests ecosystem protection (CMER, 2010), coastal protection and restoration (LACPR, 2009), natural resource management (water, land and soil), species conservation especially, fish conservation from [[overfishing]] (FOS, 2007) and [[climate change]] (DFG, 2010). In addition, some other examples follow:
 
*In 2006–2007, FOS worked with The National Fish and Wildlife Foundation (NFWF) to develop an evaluation system help NFWF gauge impact across the various coral reef habitat and species conservation projects;
*In 2007, FOS worked with the Ocean Conservancy (OC) to evaluate the effectiveness of this Scorecard in helping to end overfishing in domestic fisheries.
*Between 1999–2004, FOS worked for WWF's Asian Rhino and Elephant Action Strategy (AREAS) Program to ensure that Asian elephants and rhinos thrive in secure habitats within their historical range and in harmony with people.
*The Department of Fish and Game (DFG) is developing and implementing adaptation strategies to help protect, restore and manage fish and wildlife, with the understanding that some level of climate change will occur and that it will have profound effects on ecosystems in the United States.
*The Adaptive Management program was created by CMR to provide science-based recommendations and technical information to assist the Forest Practices Board. In April 2010, the Forest Practices Adaptive Management Annual Science Conference was held in Washington.
*In 2009, The Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) Technical Report has been developed by the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] (USACE) according to adaptive management process.
*Since 2009, the Kenya Wildlife Service has been managing its marine protected areas using adaptive management in an ongoing process of learning through the  Science for Active Management (SAM)&lt;ref&gt;[http://sam4wio.weebly.com Science for Active Management]&lt;/ref&gt; Program.

==In international development==

The concept of adaptive management is not restricted to natural resources or ecosystem management, as similar concepts have been applied to [[international development]] programming.&lt;ref&gt;"2 Adaptive Management Theories, Frameworks, and Practices." National Research Council. 2004. Adaptive Management for Water Resources Project Planning.  Washington, DC: The National Academies Press. doi: 10.17226/10972.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rondinell, D. A. (1993) Development Projects as Policy Experiments: an adaptive approach to development administration, 2nd ed, Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt; This has often been a recognition to the "wicked" nature of many development challenges and the limits of traditional planning processes.&lt;ref&gt;Webber, M. and Rittel, H. (1973), "Dilemmas in a General Theory of Planning", Policy Sciences, vol. 4, no. 2, pp. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramalingam, B., Laric, M. and Primrose, J. (2014) 'From Best Practice to Best Fit: Understanding and Navigating Wicked Problems in International Development'. Working Paper. London: ODI&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Head, B. and Alford, J. (2008) "Wicked Problems: The Implications for Public Management", 12th Annual Conference International Research Society for Public Management, Vol. Panel on Public Management in Practice, 26–28 March 2008, Brisbane.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the principal changes facing international development organizations is the need to be more flexible, adaptable and focused on learning.&lt;ref&gt;S. Smith and A. Young, "Adapting to change: becoming a learning organization as a relief and development agency," in IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, vol. 52, no. 4, pp. 329-345, Dec. 2009. {{doi|10.1109/TPC.2009.2034240}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is reflected in international development approaches such as Doing Development Differently, Politically Informed Programming and Problem Driven Iterative Adaptation.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, M., Pritchett, L. and Woolcock, M. (2015) Doing problem driven work. Working Paper 30. Cambridge, MA: Center for International Development at [[Harvard University]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booth, D. and Unsworth, S.

(2014) Problem-driven political economy analysis: The World Bank's experience. Washington DC: [[World Bank]].&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent example of the use of adaptive management by international development donors is the planned Global Learning for Adaptive Management (GLAM) programme to support adaptive management in [[Department for International Development]] and [[USAID]]. The program is establishing a centre for learning about adaptive management to support the utilization and accessibility of adaptive management.&lt;ref&gt;Funds for NGOs.

Retrieved April 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are a variety of tools used to operationalize adaptive management in programs, such as [[learning agenda]]s.

Collaborating, learning and adapting (CLA) is a concept related to the operationalizing of adaptive management in international development that describes a specific way of designing, implementing, adapting and evaluating programs.&lt;ref&gt;Altschuld, J. W., &amp; Watkins, R. (2015). Needs assessment: trends and a view toward the future. New Directions for Evaluation, Number 144.

Becoming a knowledge-sharing organization: a handbook for scaling up solutions through knowledge capturing and sharing. Washington, D.C.: [[World Bank Group]]. http://hdl.handle.net/10986/25320&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46}} CLA involves three concepts:
#collaborating intentionally with stakeholders to share knowledge and reduce duplication of effort,
#learning systematically by drawing on evidence from a variety of sources and taking the time to reflect on implementation, and
#adapting strategically based on applied learning. CLA practices have tangible benefits; for instance, a recent study recently found that companies "which apply more data-driven and adaptive leadership practices perform better" when examined against those which focus less on those practices.&lt;ref&gt;Akhtar, P., Tse, M., Khan, Z. and Rao-Nicholson, R.

CLA integrates three closely connected concepts within the organizational theory literature: namely collaborating, learning and adapting. There is evidence of the benefits of collaborating internally within an organization and externally with organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://usaidlearninglab.org/library/literature-review-evidence-base-collaborating,-learning,-and-adapting|title=Literature review of the evidence base for collaborating, learning, and adapting|last=Lab|first=Learning|date=2016-08-11|work=USAID Learning Lab|access-date=2017-06-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the production and transmission of knowledge—both [[explicit knowledge]] and [[tacit knowledge]]—occurs through collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;For example: Polanyi, Michael (1966), The tacit dimension. Chicago: [[University of Chicago Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; There is evidence for the importance of collaboration among individuals and groups for innovation, knowledge production, and diffusion—for example, the benefits of staff interacting with one another and transmitting knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Kip, and Schaefer, Alan (2014).

==Use in other practices as a tool for sustainability==
Adaptive management as a systematic process for improving environmental management policies and practices is the traditional application however, the adaptive management framework can also be applied to other sectors seeking [[sustainability]] solutions such as business and community development. Adaptive management as a strategy emphasizes the need to change with the environment and to learn from doing. Adaptive management applied to ecosystems makes overt sense when considering ever changing environmental conditions.  The flexibility and constant learning of an adaptive management approach is also a logical application for organizations seeking sustainability methodologies.
Businesses pursuing sustainability strategies would employ an adaptive management framework to ensure that the organization is prepared for the unexpected and geared for change. By applying an adaptive management approach the business begins to function as an integrated system adjusting and learning from a multi-faceted network of influences not just environmental but also, economic and social (Dunphy, Griffths, &amp; Benn, 2007). The goal of any sustainable organization guided by adaptive management principals must be to engage in active learning to direct change towards sustainability (Verine, 2008). This "learning to manage by managing to learn" (Bormann BT, 1993) will be at the core of a sustainable business strategy.

Sustainable community development requires recognition of the relationship between environment, economics and social instruments within the community. An adaptive management approach to creating sustainable community policy and practice also emphasizes the connection and confluence of those elements. Looking into the cultural mechanisms which contribute to a community value system often highlights the  parallel to adaptive management practices, "with [an] emphasis on feedback learning, and its treatment of uncertainty and unpredictability" (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000). Often this is the result of indigenous knowledge and historical decisions of societies deeply rooted in ecological practices (Berkes, Colding, &amp; Folke, 2000).  By applying an adaptive management approach to community development the resulting systems can develop built in sustainable practice as  explained by the Environmental Advisory Council (2002), "active adaptive management views policy as a set of experiments designed to reveal processes that build or sustain resilience. It requires, and facilitates, a social context with flexible and open institutions and multi-level governance systems that allow for learning and increase adaptive capacity without foreclosing future development options" (p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

In an ever-changing world, adaptive management appeals to many practices seeking sustainable solutions by offering a framework for decision making that proposes to support a sustainable future which, "conserves and nurtures the diversity—of species, of human opportunity, of learning institutions and of economic options"(The Environmental Advisory Council, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;1121).

== Effectiveness ==
It is difficult to test the effectiveness of adaptive management in comparison to other management approaches. One challenge is that once a system is managed using one approach it is difficult to determine how another approach would have performed in exactly the same situation.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Holden|first=Matthew H.|last2=Ellner|first2=Stephen P.|date=2016-07-01|title=Human judgment vs. quantitative models for the management of ecological resources|journal=Ecological Applications|language=en|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1553–1565|doi=10.1890/15-1295|pmid=27755756|issn=1939-5582}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study tested the effectiveness of formal passive adaptive management in comparison to human intuition by having natural resource management students make decisions about how to harvest a hypothetical fish population in an online computer game.

'''"An apple a day keeps the doctor away"''' is a common English-language proverb of Welsh origin. It espouses the [[Traditional knowledge|folk-wisdom]] that [[apple]] consumption (or consumption of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]] in general) has identifiable health benefits.

==Origin==
First recorded in the 1860s, the proverb originated in [[Wales]], and was particularly prevalent in [[Pembrokeshire]]. The original wording of the saying was "Eat an apple on going to bed, and you’ll keep the doctor from earning his bread." The current phrasing, "An apple a day keeps the doctor away", began usage at the end of the 19th century, &lt;ref name="wapo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/wellness/history-behind-an-apple-a-day/2013/09/24/aac3e79c-1f0e-11e3-94a2-6c66b668ea55_story.html | title=History behind ‘An apple a day’ | work=Washington Post | date=24 September 2013 | accessdate=5 December 2015 | author=Ely, Margaret}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An apple a day keeps the doctor away|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOkif_tTGtk}}&lt;/ref&gt; early print examples found as early as 1899.&lt;ref name="CtryGtlmn"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Google Books Search Results|url=https://www.google.ru/search?tbs=sbd%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_max%3A12%2F31%2F1910&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22an+apple+a+day%22|accessdate=11 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The background for the proverb was that at bedtime it was served either a fried apple filled with [[caraway]] seeds or a fresh apple with caraway seeds stuck in the apple.&lt;ref name="Borgen"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Annemarta  Borgen |title=Urtehagen på Knatten |date=1973 |publisher=Gyldendal |isbn=8205060118 |pages=37-38 |url=https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2007071701094;page=38 |language=Norwegian |chapter=Innenlandske ville kryddurter: Karve |quote=Opprinnelsen til ordspråket om at "an apple a day keeps the doctor away" er at ved sengetid ble det før servert enten et stekt eple fylt med karve eller et friskt gjennomstukket med karve. Eplet var der for at folk skulle få mest mulig karve i seg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Caraway was considered very healthy and the apple was a way to eat as much caraway as possible.&lt;ref name="Borgen"/&gt;

==Scientific evaluation==

'''Animal communication''' is the transfer of information from one or a group of animals (sender or senders) to one or more other animals (receiver or receivers) that affects the current or future behavior of the receivers. Information may be sent intentionally, as in a courtship display, or unintentionally, as in the transfer of scent from predator to prey. Information may be transferred to an "audience" of several receivers. Animal communication is a rapidly growing area of study in disciplines including [[ethology|animal behavior]], sociology, neurology and [[animal cognition]]. Many aspects of animal behavior, such as symbolic name use, emotional expression, learning and [[animal sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], are being understood in new ways.

When the information from the sender changes the behavior of a receiver, the information is referred to as a "signal". [[Signalling theory]] predicts that for a signal to be maintained in the population, both the sender and receiver should usually receive some benefit from the interaction. Signal production by senders and the perception and subsequent response of receivers are thought to [[coevolve]].&lt;ref name="Maynard-Smith and Harper, 2003"&gt;Maynard-Smith and Harper, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Signals often involve multiple mechanisms, e.g. both visual and auditory, and for a signal to be understood the coordinated behaviour of both sender and receiver require careful study.

===Visual===
{{for|information on the perception of visual signals|Visual perception}}

* '''[[Gesture]]s:''' The best known form of communication involves the display of distinctive body parts, or distinctive bodily movements; often these occur in combination, so a movement acts to reveal or emphasize a body part. A notable example is the presentation of a parent [[European herring gull|herring gull]]’s bill to its chick as a signal for feeding. Like many [[gulls]], the herring gull has a brightly coloured bill, yellow with a red spot on the lower mandible near the tip. When the parent returns to the nest with food, it stands over its chick and taps the bill on the ground; this elicits a  [[Begging behavior in animals|begging response]] from a hungry chick (pecking at the red spot), which stimulates the parent to regurgitate food. The complete signal therefore involves a distinctive morphological feature (body part), the red-spotted bill, and a distinctive movement (tapping towards the ground) which makes the red spot highly visible to the chick.  While all primates use some form of gesture,&lt;ref&gt;de Waal&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frans de Waal]] concluded that apes and humans are unique in that only they use intentional gestures to communicate. He tested the hypothesis that gestures evolve into language by studying the gestures of [[bonobo]]s and [[chimpanzee|chimps]].
[[File:Military Working Dog Unit Training Camp Lemonier DVIDS165231.jpg|thumb|upright|A dog's visual tooth-baring threat display, accompanied by an auditory signal, growling]]
* '''[[Facial expression]]:''' Facial gestures play an important role in animal communication.  Often a facial gesture is a signal of [[emotion in animals|emotion]].  Dogs, for example, express anger through snarling and showing their teeth. In alarm their ears perk up, in fear the ears flatten while the dogs expose their teeth slightly and squint their eyes. Jeffrey Mogil studied the facial expressions of mice during increments of increasing pain; there were five recognizable facial expressions; orbital tightening, nose and cheek bulge, and changes in ear and whisker carriage.&lt;ref name="Langford, D.J. et al., (2010)"&gt;Langford, D.J. et al., (2010).  Coding of facial expressions of pain in the laboratory mouse. Nature Methods, May 9th. pp. 1-3. {{doi|10.1038/nmeth.1455}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Gaze]]-following:''' Social animals coordinate their communication by monitoring of each other's head and eye orientation. Such behaviour has long been recognized as an important component of communication during human development, and gaze-following has recently received much attention in animals. Studies have been conducted on apes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bräuer|first=Juliane|last2=Call|first2=Josep|last3=Tomasello|first3=Michael|date=2005|title=All Great Ape Species Follow Gaze to Distant Locations and Around Barriers.|url=https://doi.org/10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.145|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|language=en|volume=119|issue=2|pages=145–154|doi=10.1037/0735-7036.119.2.145|issn=1939-2087}}&lt;/ref&gt;, monkeys, dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Téglás|first=Ernő|last2=Gergely|first2=Anna|last3=Kupán|first3=Krisztina|last4=Miklósi|first4=Ádám|last5=Topál|first5=József|date=2012|title=Dogs' Gaze Following Is Tuned to Human Communicative Signals|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.12.018|journal=Current Biology|volume=22|issue=3|pages=209–212|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.12.018|issn=0960-9822|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, birds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schloegl|first=Christian|last2=Kotrschal|first2=Kurt|last3=Bugnyar|first3=Thomas|date=2007|title=Gaze following in common ravens, Corvus corax: ontogeny and habituation|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.017|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=74|issue=4|pages=769–778|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2006.08.017|issn=0003-3472|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, wolves and tortoises, and have focused on two different tasks: "follow[ing] another’s gaze into distant space" and "follow[ing] another’s gaze geometrically around a visual barrier e.g. by repositioning themselves to follow a gaze cue when faced with a barrier blocking their view". The first ability has been found among a broad range of animals, while the second has been demonstrated only for apes, dogs, wolves, and corvids (ravens); attempts to demonstrate this "geometric gaze following" in [[marmosets|marmoset]] and [[ibis]] gave negative results.  Researchers do not yet have a clear picture of the cognitive basis of gaze following, but developmental evidence indicates that "simple" gaze following and "geometric" gaze following probably rely on different cognitive mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Range | first1 = F. | last2 = Virányi | first2 = Z. | year = 2011 | title = Development of gaze following abilities in wolves (Canis Lupus) | journal = PLoS ONE | volume = 6 | issue = 2| page = e16888 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0016888 | pmid=21373192 | pmc=3044139| bibcode = 2011PLoSO...616888R }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Color change:''' Color change can be separated into changes that occur during growth and development, and those triggered by mood, social context, or abiotic factors such as temperature.  The latter are seen in many taxa.  Some [[cephalopod]]s, such as the [[octopus]] and the [[cuttlefish]], have specialized skin cells ([[chromatophores]]) that can change the apparent colour, opacity, and reflectiveness of their skin.&lt;ref name=cephalopod1&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cloney | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Florey | first2 = E. | year = 1968 | title = Ultrastructure of cephalopod chromatophore organs | url = | journal = Z.

When a male cuttlefish courts a female in the presence of other males, he displays a male pattern facing the female and a female pattern facing away, to deceive other males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah |last=Williams |year=2012 |title=Two-faced fish tricks competitors |publisher=Science Now |url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/07/two-faced-fish-tricks-competitor.html |accessdate=March 16, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130308094334/http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2012/07/two-faced-fish-tricks-competitor.html |archivedate=March 8, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some color signals occur in cycles. For example, when a female olive baboon begins to ovulate, her anogenital area swells and turns a bright red/pink. This signals to males that she is ready to mate.&lt;ref name=Motluk&gt;{{cite journal | author = Motluk, Alison | title = Big Bottom | journal = New Scientist | volume = 19 | issue = 7|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn494-big-bottom.html | year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Bioluminescence|Bioluminescent communication]]:''' Communication by the production of light occurs commonly in vertebrates and invertebrates in the oceans, particularly at depths (e.g. [[angler fish]]).  Two well known forms of land bioluminescence occur in [[Firefly|fireflies]] and [[Phengodidae|glow worms]]. Other insects, insect [[larva]]e, [[annelid]]s, [[arachnid]]s and even species of [[fungus|fungi]] possess bioluminescent abilities.  Some bioluminescent animals produce the light themselves whereas others have a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] relationship with bioluminescent bacteria. (See also: [[List of bioluminescent organisms]])

Many animals communicate through vocalization. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including mating rituals, warning calls, conveying location of food sources, and social learning. In a number of species, males perform calls during mating rituals as a form of competition against other males and to signal females. Examples include [[frogs]], [[hammer-headed bat]]s, [[red deer]], [[humpback whale]]s, [[elephant seal]]s, and [[songbird]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Slabbekoorn, Hans, Smith, Thomas B. "Bird song, ecology and speciation."  Philosophical Transactions: Biology Sciences  357.1420 (2002). 493-503.&lt;/ref&gt; Other instances of vocal communication include the [[alarm call]]s of the [[Campbell monkey]],&lt;ref&gt;Zuberbühler, Klause. "Predator-specific alarm calls in Campbell's monkeys, Cercopithecus campbelli." Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology 50.5 (2001). 414-442&lt;/ref&gt; the [[territory (animal)|territorial]] calls of [[gibbon]]s, and the use of frequency in [[greater spear-nosed bat]]s to distinguish between groups.&lt;ref&gt;Boughman, Janette W. "Vocal learning by greater spear-nosed bats." Proceedings: Biological Sciences 265.1392 (1998). 227-233&lt;/ref&gt; The [[vervet monkey]] gives a distinct alarm call for each of its four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary appropriately according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the "eagle" alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. [[Prairie dogs]] also use complex calls that signal predator differences. According to [[Con Slobodchikoff]] and others, prairie dog calls communicate the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jabr|first1=Ferris|title=Can Prairie Dogs Talk?|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/magazine/can-prairie-dogs-talk.html|work=The New York Times|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/2011/01/20/132650631/new-language-discovered-prairiedogese |title=New Language Discovered: Prairiedogese |last1=Krulwich |first1=Robert |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=20 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.petroglyphsnm.org/wildsides/pdlanguage.html |title=Yips, barks and chirps: the language of prairie dogs  |last1=DeMello |first1=Margo |last2= |first2= |date=2007 |website= |publisher= |access-date=20 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/prairie-dogs-language-decoded-by-scientists-1.1322230 |title=Prairie dogs' language decoded by scientists |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=21 June 2013 |website= |publisher=[[CBC News]] |access-date=20 May 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Whale vocalization]]s have been found to have different dialects based on region.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, Bjorn.

Not all animals use vocalization as a means of auditory communication. Many [[arthropod]]s rub specialized body parts together to produce sound. This is known as [[stridulation]]. [[Cricket]]s and [[grasshopper]]s are well known for this, but many others use stridulation as well, including [[crustacean]]s, [[spider]]s, [[scorpion]]s, [[wasp]]s, [[ant]]s, [[beetle]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]], [[moth]]s, [[millipede]]s, and [[centipede]]s. Another means of auditory communication is the vibration of [[swim bladder]]s in [[bony fish]]. The structure of swim bladders and the attached sonic muscles varies greatly across bony fish families, resulting in a wide variety of sounds. Striking body parts together can also produce auditory signals. A well-known example of this is the tail tip vibration of [[rattlesnake]]s as a warning signal. Other examples include bill clacking in birds, wing clapping in [[manakin]] courtship displays, and chest beating in [[gorillas]].&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"&gt;Bradbury, J.W., and S.L. Vehrencamp. Principles of Animal Communication. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates Inc., 2011. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olfactory===
{{main article|Olfaction}}

Despite being the oldest method of communication, chemical communication is one of the least understood forms due in part to the sheer abundance of chemicals in our environment and the difficulty of detecting and measuring all the chemicals in a sample.&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"/&gt;  The ability to detect chemicals in the environment serves many functions, a crucial one being the detection of food, a function that first arose in single-celled organisms ([[bacteria]]) living in the oceans during the early days of life on Earth.&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"/&gt; As this function evolved, organisms began to differentiate between chemicals compounds emanating from resources, conspecifics (same species; i.e., mates and kin), and heterospecifics (different species; i.e., competitors and predators).&lt;ref name="Bradbury, J.W. 2011"/&gt;   For instance, a small minnow species may do well to avoid habitat with a detectable concentration of chemical cue associated with a predator species such as northern pike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brown | first1 = G.E. | last2 = Chivers | first2 = D.P. | last3 = Smith | first3 = R.J.F. | year = 1995 | title = Localized defecation by pike: A response to labelling by cyprinid alarm pheromone? | url = | journal = Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 105–110 | doi=10.1007/s002650050130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minnows with the ability to perceive the presence of predators before they are close enough to be seen and then respond with adaptive behaviour (such as hiding) are more likely to survive and reproduce.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} [[Scent marking]] and [[scent rubbing]] are common forms of olfactory communication in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;Gosling, L.

===Electric===
{{Main article|Electrocommunication}}

Electrocommunication is a rare form of communication in animals. It is seen primarily in aquatic animals, though some land mammals, notably the [[platypus]] and [[echidna]]s, sense electric fields that might be used for communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2003/Wilson/Communication.htm |title=Electrocommunication |publisher=Davidson College |archive-url=https://archive.fo/20120529130443/http://www.bio.davidson.edu/people/midorcas/animalphysiology/websites/2003/Wilson/Communication.htm |archive-date=2012-05-29 |access-date=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[electric fish|Weakly electric fishes]] provide an example of electrocommunication, together with [[electrolocation]].  These fish use an electric organ to generate an electric field, which is detected by [[electroreception|electroreceptors]].  Differences in the waveform and frequency of changes in the field convey information on species, sex, and identity.  These electric signals can be generated in response to hormones, circadian rhythms, and interactions with other fish.  Some predators, such as sharks and rays, are able to eavesdrop on these electrogenic fish through passive electroreception.

===Touch===
: ''For more on the mechanism for touch, see [[Somatosensory system]] and [[Mechanoreceptor]]s''

Touch is a key factor in many social interactions. Here are some examples:
*Fighting: In a fight, touch may be used to challenge an opponent and to coordinate movements during the fight. It may also be used by the loser to indicate submission. 
*Mating: Mammals often initiate mating by grooming, stroking or rubbing against each other. This provides the opportunity to apply chemical signals and to assess those excreted by the potential mate. Touch may also announce the intention of the male to mount the female, as when a male kangaroo grabs the tail of a female. During mating, touch stimuli are important for pair positioning, coordination and genital stimulation.
*Social integration: Touch is widely used for social integration, a use that is typified by the social grooming of one animal by another. Social grooming has several functions; it removes parasites and debris from the groomed animal, it reaffirms the social bond or hierarchical relationship between the animals, and it gives the groomer an opportunity to examine [[Olfaction|olfactory]] cues on the groomed individual, perhaps adding additional ones. This behaviour has been observed in social insects, birds and mammals.
*Foraging: Some ant species recruit fellow workers to new food finds by first tapping them with their antennae and forelegs, then leading them to the food source while keeping physical contact. Another example of this is the [[Waggle dance|waggle dance of honey bees]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradbury, J.W., and S.L. Vehrencamp. Principles of Animal Communication. Sunderland, MA: Sinauer Associates Inc., 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Huddling: Prolonged physical contact or [[Huddle|huddling]] also serves social integration. Huddling promotes heat exchange, together with the transfer of olfactory or tactile information. Some organisms live in constant contact in a colony, for example colonial corals. When individuals are linked tightly in this way an entire colony can react on the aversive or alarm movements made by only a few individuals. In several herbivorous insect nymphs and larvae, aggregations where there is prolonged contact play a major role in group coordination. These aggregations may take the form of a procession or a rosette.

===Seismic===
{{main article|Seismic communication}}

Seismic communication is the exchange of information using self-generated vibrational signals transmitted via a substrate such as the soil, water, spider webs, plant stems, or a blade of grass.  This form of communication has several advantages, for example it can be sent regardless of light and noise levels, and it usually has a short range and short persistence, which may reduce the danger of detection by predators.  The use of seismic communication is found in many taxa, including frogs, kangaroo rats, mole rats, bees, nematode worms, and others.  Tetrapods usually make seismic waves by drumming on the ground with a body part, a signal that is sensed by the [[sacculus]] of the receiver.  The sacculus is an organ in the inner ear containing a membranous sac that is used for balance, but can also detect seismic waves in animals that use this form of communication. Vibrations may be combined with other sorts of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Narins, Peter M. "Seismic Communication in Anuran Amphibians." BioScience40.4 (1990): 268. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thermal===
{{Main article|Thermoreception}}
[[Image:The Pit Organs of Two Different Snakes.jpg|thumb|A python (top) and rattlesnake illustrating the positions of the pit organs. Red arrows indicate the pit organs whereas black arrows indicate the nostril.]] A number of different snakes have the ability to sense [[infrared]] (IR) thermal radiation, which allows these reptiles to derive thermal images from the radiant heat emitted by predators or prey at [[wavelengths]] between 5 and 30 [[μm]]. The accuracy of this sense is such that a blind [[rattlesnake]] can target its strike to the vulnerable body parts of a prey animal.&lt;ref&gt;(Kardong &amp; Mackessy 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously thought that the pit organs evolved primarily as prey detectors, but it is now believed that they may also be used to control body temperature.&lt;ref&gt;(Krochmal et al. 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The facial pits enabling thermoregulation underwent [[parallel evolution]] in [[pitvipers]] and some [[Boidae|boas]] and [[pythons]], having evolved once in pitvipers and multiple times in boas and pythons.&lt;ref&gt;(Pough et al. 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[electrophysiology]] of the structure is similar between lineages, but it differs in gross structure [[anatomy]]. Most superficially, pitvipers possess one large pit organ on either side of the head, between the eye and the nostril ([[loreal pit]]), while boas and pythons have three or more comparatively smaller pits lining the upper and sometimes the lower lip, in or between the scales. Those of the pitvipers are the more advanced, having a suspended sensory membrane as opposed to a simple pit structure.  Within the family [[Viperidae]], the pit organ is seen only in the subfamily [[Crotalinae]]: the pitvipers. Despite the detection of IR radiation, the pits’ IR mechanism is dissimilar to photoreceptors; while photoreceptors detect light via photochemical reactions, the protein in the facial pits of snakes is a temperature sensitive ion channel. It senses infrared signals through a mechanism involving warming of the pit organ, rather than chemical reaction to light.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"&gt;(Gracheva et al. 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This is consistent with the thin pit membrane, which allows incoming IR radiation to quickly and precisely warm a given ion channel and trigger a nerve impulse, as well as vascularize the pit membrane to rapidly cool the ion channel back to its original “resting” or “inactive” temperature.&lt;ref name="Gracheva et al. 2010"/&gt;

[[Common vampire bat]]s (''Desmodus rotundus'') have specialized IR sensors in their nose-leaf.&lt;ref name="Kurten"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kürten, L., Schmidt, U. and Schäfer, K.|year=1984|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF00396621|title=Warm and cold receptors in the nose of the vampire bat, ''Desmodus rotundus''|journal=Naturwissenschaften|volume=71|pages=327–328.|doi=10.1007/BF00396621|bibcode=1984NW.....71..327K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vampire bats are the only mammals that feed exclusively on blood. The IR sense enables Desmodus to localize [[homeothermic]] animals such as cattle and horses within a range of about 10 to 15&amp;nbsp;cm. This [[Infrared sensing in vampire bats|infrared perception]] may be used in detecting regions of maximal blood flow on targeted prey.

==Autocommunication==
[[Autocommunication]] is a type of communication in which the sender and receiver are the same individual. The sender emits a signal that is altered by the environment and eventually is received by the same individual. The altered signal provides information that can indicate food, predators or conspecifics. Because the sender and receiver are the same animal, [[selection pressure]] maximizes signal efficacy, i.e. the degree to which an emitted signal is correctly identified by a receiver despite propagation distortion and noise.  There are two types of autocommunication.  The first is active [[electrolocation]] found in the [[electric fish]] [[Gymnotiformes]] (knifefishes) and [[Mormyridae]] (elephantfish) and also in the [[platypus]] (''Ornithorhynchus anatinus'').  The second type of autocommunication is [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]], found in [[bats]] and [[Odontoceti|toothed whales]].

==Functions==
There are many functions of animal communication.  However, some have been studied in more detail than others.  This includes:

* '''Communication during contests''': Animal communication plays a vital role in determining the winner of contest over a resource.  Many species have distinct signals that signal aggression or willingness to attack or signals to convey retreat during competitions over food, territories, or mates.
[[file:Red_Deer_(Cervus_elaphus)_(W1CDR0001424_BD3).ogg|right|thumb|Two ''Red Deer'' roaring most likely to establish dominance during a rut.  However, males also use loud roaring to keep track of harems of females.]]
* '''[[Mating]] rituals''':  Animals produce signals to attract the attention of a possible mate or to solidify pair bonds.  These signals frequently involve the display of body parts or postures.  For example, a gazelle will assume characteristic poses to initiate mating.  Mating signals can also include the use of [[olfactory]] signals or [[mating call]]s unique to a species.  Animals that form lasting [[pair bond]]s often have symmetrical displays that they make to each other.  Famous examples are the mutual presentation of reeds by great crested grebes studied by [[Julian Huxley]], the triumph displays shown by many species of [[geese]] and [[penguins]] on their nest sites, and the spectacular courtship displays by [[birds of paradise]].
* '''Ownership/territorial''': Signals used to claim or defend a territory, food, or a mate.

* '''Food-related signals''': Many animals make "food calls" to attract a mate, offspring, or other members of a social group to a food source.  Perhaps the most elaborate food-related signal is the [[Waggle dance]] of [[honeybees]] studied by [[Karl von Frisch]].  One well-known example of begging of offspring in a clutch or litter is [[altricial]] songbirds. Young ravens will signal to older ravens when they encounter new or untested food.  [[Rhesus macaques]] will send food calls to inform other monkeys of a food source to avoid punishment.   [[Pheromones]] are released by many social insects to lead the other members of the society to the food source. For example, [[ants]] leave a pheromone trail on the ground that can be followed by other ants to lead them to the food source.
* '''[[Alarm calls]]''': Alarm calls communicate the threat of a predator.  This allows all members of a social group (and sometimes other species) to respond accordingly.  This may include running for cover, becoming immobile, or gathering into a group to reduce the risk of attack. Alarm signals are not always vocalizations. Crushed ants will release an alarm pheromone to attract more ants and send them into an attack state.
* '''[[Meta-communication]]''': Signals that will modify the meaning of subsequent signals. One example is the 'play face' in [[dogs]] which signals that a subsequent aggressive signal is part of a play fight rather than a serious aggressive episode.

==Interpretation of animal behaviour==
As described above, many animal gestures, postures, and sounds, convey meaning to nearby animals. These signals are often easier to describe than to interpret. It is tempting, especially with domesticated animals and apes, to [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphize]], that is, to interpret animal actions in human terms, but this can be quite misleading; for example, an ape's "smile" is often a sign of aggression. Also, the same gesture may have different meanings depending on context within which it occurs.  For example, a domestic [[dog]]'s tail wag and posture may be used in different ways to convey many meanings as illustrated in [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]] published in 1872. Some of Darwin's illustrations are reproduced here.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Interspecific communication==
{{main|Interspecies communication}}
Much animal communication is intraspecific, that is, it occurs between members of the same species. As for interspecific communication, that between predator and prey is of particular interest.

===Prey to predator===
If a prey animal moves, makes a noise or vibrations, or emits a smell in such a way that a predator can detect it, this is consistent with the definition of "communication" given above. This type of communication is known as interceptive eavesdropping if a predator intercepts a message intended for conspecifics.

There are however, some actions of prey species are clearly directed to actual or potential predators. A good example is [[warning coloration]]: species such as [[wasp]]s that are capable of harming potential predators are often brightly coloured, and this modifies the behaviour of the predator, who either instinctively or as the result of experience will avoid attacking such an animal. Some forms of [[mimicry]] fall in the same category: for example [[hoverfly|hoverflies]] are coloured in the same way as wasps, and although they are unable to sting, the strong avoidance of wasps by predators gives the hoverfly some protection. There are also behavioural changes that act in a similar way to warning colouration. For example, canines such as [[wolf|wolves]] and [[coyote]]s may adopt an aggressive posture, such as growling with their teeth bared, to indicate they will fight if necessary, and [[rattlesnake]]s use their well-known rattle to warn potential predators of their venomous bite. Sometimes, a behavioural change and warning colouration will be combined, as in certain species of [[amphibia]]ns which have most of their body coloured to blend with their surroundings, except for a brightly coloured belly. When confronted with a potential threat, they show their belly, indicating that they are poisonous in some way.

Another example of prey to predator communication is the pursuit-deterrent signal. Pursuit-deterrent signals occur when prey indicates to a predator that pursuit would be unprofitable because the signaler is prepared to escape. Pursuit-deterrent signals provide a benefit to both the signaler and receiver; they prevent the sender from wasting time and energy fleeing, and they prevent the receiver from investing in a costly pursuit that is unlikely to result in capture. Such signals can advertise prey’s ability to escape, and reflect phenotypic condition (quality advertisement), or can advertise that the prey has detected the predator (perception advertisement). Pursuit-deterrent signals have been reported for a wide variety of taxa, including fish (Godin and Davis, 1995), lizards (Cooper et al., 2004), ungulates (Caro, 1995), rabbits (Holley 1993), primates (Zuberbuhler et al. 1997), rodents (Shelley and Blumstein 2005, Clark, 2005), and birds (Alvarez, 1993, Murphy, 2006, 2007). A familiar example of quality advertisement pursuit-deterrent signal is ''[[stotting]]'' (sometimes called ''pronking''), a pronounced combination of stiff-legged running while simultaneously jumping shown by some [[antelope]]s such as [[Thomson's gazelle]] in the presence of a predator. At least 11 hypotheses for stotting have been proposed. A leading theory today is that it alerts predators that the element of surprise has been lost. Predators like cheetahs rely on surprise attacks, proven by the fact that chases are rarely successful when antelope stot. Predators do not waste energy on a chase that will likely be unsuccessful (optimal foraging behaviour).  Quality advertisement can be communicated by modes other than visual.  The [[banner-tailed kangaroo rat]] produces several complex foot-drumming patterns in a number of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake.  The foot-drumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys vibrations through the ground that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapoflife.org/topics/topic_458_Vibrational-communication-in-animals/|title=Web of Life:Vibrational communication in animals|accessdate=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Predator to prey===
[[File:Humpback anglerfish.png|thumb|right|200px|The [[humpback anglerfish]] angles for small fish by deceptively dangling a bioluminescent [[Fishing lure|lure]] in front of its jaws.]]
{{further|Deception in animals}}

Typically, predators attempt to reduce communication to prey as this will generally reduce the effectiveness of their hunting. However, some forms of predator to prey communication occur in ways that change the behaviour of the prey and make their capture easier, i.e. [[Deception in animals|deception]] by the predator. A well-known example is the [[angler fish]], an [[ambush predator]] which waits for its prey to come to it. It has a fleshy [[Bioluminescence|bioluminescent]] growth protruding from its forehead which it dangles in front of its jaws. Smaller fish attempt to take the lure, placing themselves in a better position for the angler fish to catch them. Another example of deceptive communication is observed in the genus of jumping spiders ([[Myrmarachne]]). These spiders are commonly referred to as “[[Ant mimicry|antmimicking]] spiders” because of the way they wave their front legs in the air to simulate [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]].

===Human/animal===
{{main article|Human–animal communication}}
Various ways in which humans interpret the behaviour of animals, or give commands to them, are consistent with the definition of [[interspecies communication]]. Skillful interpretation of animal communications may be critical to the welfare of animals that are being cared for or trained by humans. For example, behaviours indicating pain need to be recognized. Indeed, the survival of both the animal and its human caretaker may be at stake if, for example, a human fails to recognize a signal for imminent attack. It is also important to take into account that non-human animal species may interpret the signals of humans differently than humans themselves. For instance, a pointing command refers to a location rather than an object in dogs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tauzin|first=Tibor|last2=Csík|first2=Andor|last3=Kis|first3=Anna|last4=Topál|first4=József|date=2015|title=What or where? The meaning of referential human pointing for dogs (Canis familiaris).|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0039462|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|language=en|volume=129|issue=4|pages=334–338|doi=10.1037/a0039462|issn=1939-2087}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Since the late 1990s, one scientist, [[Sean Senechal]], has been developing, studying, and using the learned visible, expressive language in dogs and horses. By teaching these animals a gestural (human made) [[American Sign Language]]-like language, the animals have been found to use the new signs on their own to get what they need.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Senechal: ''Dogs can sign, too. A breakthrough method of teaching your dog to communicate to you'', 2009, Random House/Crown/TenSpeed Press&lt;/ref&gt; The recent experiments on [[animal language]] are perhaps the most sophisticated attempt yet to establish human/animal communication, though their relation to natural animal communication is uncertain.

==Other aspects==

===Evolution===
{{further|Signalling theory}}

The importance of communication is evident from the highly elaborate morphology, behaviour and physiology that some animals have evolved to facilitate this. These include some of the most striking structures in the animal kingdom, such as the [[peacock]]'s tail, the antlers of a [[Deer|stag]] and the frill of the [[frill-necked lizard]], but also include even the modest red spot on a [[European herring gull]]'s bill.  Highly elaborate behaviours have evolved for communication such as the dancing of [[Crane (bird)|cranes]], the pattern changes of [[cuttlefish]], and the gathering and arranging of materials by [[bowerbird]]s.  Other evidence for the importance of communication in animals is the prioritisation of physiological features to this function, for example, [[Bird vocalization|birdsong]] appears to have brain structures entirely devoted to its production. All these adaptations require evolutionary explanation.

There are two aspects to the required explanation:

* identifying a route by which an animal that lacked the relevant feature or behaviour could acquire it;
* identifying the selective pressure that makes it adaptive for animals to develop structures that facilitate communication, emit communications, and respond to them.

Significant contributions to the first of these problems were made by [[Konrad Lorenz]] and other early [[ethologist]]s. By comparing related species within groups, they showed that movements and body parts that in the primitive forms had no communicative function could be "captured" in a context where communication would be functional for one or both partners, and could evolve into a more elaborate, specialised form. For example, [[Desmond Morris]] showed in a study of grass [[finch]]es{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} that a beak-wiping response occurred in a range of species, serving a [[personal grooming|preening]] function, but that in some species this had been elaborated into a [[courtship]] signal.

The second problem has been more controversial. The early ethologists assumed that communication occurred for the good of the species as a whole, but this would require a process of [[group selection]] which is believed to be mathematically impossible in the [[evolution]] of sexually reproducing animals. Altruism towards an unrelated group is not widely accepted in the scientific community, but rather can be seen as reciprocal altruism, expecting the same behaviour from others, a benefit of living in a group. [[sociobiology|Sociobiologists]] argued that behaviours that benefited a whole group of animals might emerge as a result of selection pressures acting solely on the individual. A [[gene-centered view of evolution]] proposes that behaviours that enabled a [[gene]] to become wider established within a population would become positively selected for, even if their effect on individuals or the species as a whole was detrimental;&lt;ref&gt;discussed at length by [[Richard Dawkins]] under the subject of his book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peacock in Toronto.jpg|thumb|right|The apparently excessive eye-spot signalling by the male peacock tail may be [[runaway selection]]]]

In the case of communication, an important discussion by [[John Krebs]] and [[Richard Dawkins]] established hypotheses for the evolution of such apparently [[altruism|altruistic]] or mutualistic communications as alarm calls and courtship signals to emerge under individual selection. This led to the realization that communication might not always be "honest" (indeed, there are some obvious examples where it is not, as in [[mimic]]ry). The possibility of evolutionarily stable dishonest communication has been the subject of much controversy, with [[Amotz Zahavi]] in particular arguing that it cannot exist in the long term. Sociobiologists have also been concerned with the evolution of apparently excessive signaling structures such as the peacock's tail; it is widely thought that these can only emerge as a result of [[sexual selection]], which can create a [[positive feedback]] process that leads to the rapid exaggeration of a characteristic that confers an advantage in a competitive mate-selection situation.

One theory to explain the evolution of traits like a peacock's tail is 'runaway selection'. This requires two traits—a trait that exists, like the bright tail, and a prexisting bias in the female to select for that trait. Females prefer the more elaborate tails, and thus those males are able to mate successfully. Exploiting the psychology of the female, a positive feedback loop is enacted and the tail becomes bigger and brighter. Eventually, the evolution will level off because the survival costs to the male do not allow for the trait to be elaborated any further. Two theories exist to explain runaway selection. The first is the good genes hypothesis. This theory states that an elaborate display is an honest signal of fitness and truly is a better mate. The second is the handicap hypothesis. This explains that the peacock's tail is a handicap, requiring energy to keep and makes it more visible to predators. Thus, the signal is costly to maintain, and remains an honest indicator of the signaler's condition. Another assumption is that the signal is more costly for low quality males to produce than for higher quality males to produce. This is simply because the higher quality males have more energy reserves available to allocate to costly signaling.&lt;ref name="Maynard-Smith and Harper, 2003"/&gt;

===Cognitive aspects===
Ethologists and sociobiologists have characteristically analysed animal communication in terms of more or less automatic responses to stimuli, without raising the question of whether the animals concerned understand the meaning of the signals they emit and receive. That is a key question in [[animal cognition]]. There are some signalling systems that seem to demand a more advanced understanding. A much discussed example is the use of alarm calls by [[vervet monkey]]s. Robert Seyfarth and [[Dorothy Cheney (scientist)|Dorothy Cheney]] showed that these animals emit different alarm calls in the presence of different predators ([[leopard]]s, [[eagle]]s, and [[snake]]s), and the monkeys that hear the calls respond appropriately—but that this ability develops over time, and also takes into account the experience of the individual emitting the call. Metacommunication, discussed above, also seems to require a more sophisticated cognitive process.

It has been reported &lt;ref name="PNAS-2006"&gt;V. M. Janik, L. S. Sayigh, and R. S. Wells: "Signature whistle shape conveys identity information to bottlenose dolphins", ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences'', vol. 103 no 21, May 23, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; that bottlenose dolphins can recognize identity information from whistles even when otherwise stripped of the characteristics of the whistle; making dolphins the only animals other than humans that have been shown to transmit identity information independent of the caller’s voice or location. The paper concludes that:
{{"
 |The fact that signature whistle shape carries identity information independent from voice features presents the possibility to use these whistles as referential signals, either addressing individuals or referring to them, similar to the use of names in humans. Given the cognitive abilities of bottlenose dolphins, their vocal learning and copying skills, and their fission–fusion social structure, this possibility is an intriguing one that demands further investigation.|V. M. Janik, ''et al.'' &lt;ref name="PNAS-2006"/&gt;}}

===Human behaviour===
Another controversial issue is the extent to which human behaviours resemble animal communication, or whether all such communication has disappeared as a result of our linguistic capacity. Some of our bodily features—eyebrows, beards and moustaches, deep adult male voices, perhaps female breasts—strongly resemble adaptations to producing signals. Ethologists such as [[Eibl-Eibesfeldt|Irenäus Eibl-Eibesfeldt]] have argued that facial gestures such as smiling, grimacing, and the ''eyebrow flash'' on greeting are universal human communicative signals that can be related to corresponding signals in other [[primate]]s. Given how recently spoken language has emerged, it is very likely that human [[body language]] does include some more or less involuntary responses that have a similar origin to the communication we have.

Humans also often seek to mimic animals' communicative signals in order to interact with them. For example, cats have a mild affiliative response of slowly closing their eyes; humans often mimic this signal towards a [[pet]] cat to establish a tolerant relationship. Stroking, petting and rubbing pet animals are all actions that probably work through their natural patterns of interspecific communication.

Dogs have shown an ability to understand human communication. In object choice tasks, dogs utilize human communicative gestures such as pointing and direction of gaze in order to locate hidden food and toys.&lt;ref name="EOC-1998"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hare | first1 = B. | last2 = Call | first2 = J. | last3 = Tomasello | first3 = M. | year = 1998 | title = Communication of food location between human and dog (Canis familiaris) | url = | journal = Evolution of Communication | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 137–159 | doi=10.1075/eoc.2.1.06har}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that dogs exhibit a left gaze bias when looking at human faces, indicating that they are capable of reading human emotions.&lt;ref&gt;K. Guo, K. Meints, C. Hall, S. Hall &amp; D. Mills: "Left gaze bias in humans, rhesus monkeys and rhesus domestic dogs." "Animal Cognition", vol. 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs do not make use of direction of gaze or exhibit left gaze bias with other dogs.

A new approach in the 21st century in the field of animal communication uses [[applied behavioural analysis]], specifically functional communication training. This form of training previously has been used in schools and clinics with humans with special needs, such as children with autism, to help them develop language. [[Sean Senechal]] at the AnimalSign Center has been using an approach similar to functional communication training with domesticated animals, such as dogs since 2004 and horses since 2000, with encouraging results and benefits to the animals and people. Functional communication training for animals, Senechal calls "AnimalSign Language". This includes teaching communication through gestures (like simplified [[American sign language]]), [[Picture Exchange Communication System]], tapping, and vocalisation. The process for animals includes simplified and modified techniques.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

===Linguistics===
{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_1FY5kL_zXU Do animals have language? - Michele Bishop], [[TED (conference)|TED Ed]], 4:54, September 10, 2015&lt;ref name="teded"&gt;{{cite web | title =Do animals have language? - Michele Bishop | work = | publisher =[[TED (conference)|TED Ed]] | date =10 September 2015 | url =http://ed.ted.com/lessons/do-animals-have-language-michele-bishop | accessdate =11 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{Main article|Animal language}}
For [[linguistics]], the interest of animal communication systems lies in their similarities to and differences from human language:

# Human languages are characterized for having a '''[[double articulation]]''' (in the characterization of French linguist [[André Martinet]]). It means that complex linguistic expressions can be broken down in meaningful elements (such as [[morpheme]]s and [[word]]s), which in turn are composed of smallest phonetic elements that affect meaning, called [[phoneme]]s. Animal signals, however, do not exhibit this dual structure.
# In general, animal utterances are responses to external stimuli, and do not refer to matters removed in time and space. Matters of relevance at a distance, such as distant food sources, tend to be indicated to other individuals by [[body language]] instead, for example [[wolf]] activity before a hunt, or the information conveyed in [[Bee learning and communication|honeybee dance language]].It is therefore unclear to what extent utterances are automatic responses and to what extent deliberate intent plays a part.
# In contrast to human [[language]], animal communication systems are usually not able to express conceptual generalizations. ([[Cetacean]]s and some [[primate]]s may be notable exceptions).
# Human languages combine elements to produce new messages (a property known as '''creativity'''). One factor in this is that much human language growth is based upon conceptual ideas and hypothetical structures, both being far greater capabilities in humans than animals. This appears far less common in animal communication systems, although current research into [[animal culture]] is still an ongoing process with many new discoveries.

In 2009 it was reported that affixation may play a role in the call meanings of [[Campbell's mona monkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2009/12/monkey-talk/|author=Brandon Kiem|title=Rudiments of Language Discovered in Monkeys|publisher=Wiredscience|date=December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Errors in communication ==
There becomes possibility for error within communication between animals when certain circumstances apply. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=vzrZsbCR8gcC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=animal+communication&amp;ots=oXXuOL3BvO&amp;sig=tarsflz8ECN8ApJWgoYnxcLtMsA#v=onepage&amp;q=animal%20communication&amp;f=false|title=Behavioral Mechanisms in Evolutionary Ecology|last=Real|first=Leslie A.|date=1994-12-15|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=9780226705958|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;These circumstances could include distance between the two communicating subjects, as well as the complexity of the signal that is being communicated to the "listener" of the situation. It may not always be clear to the "listener" where the location of the communication is coming from, as the "singer" can sometimes deceive them and create more error.{{fact|date=October 2018}}

'''Applied engineering''' is the field concerned with the application of management, design, and technical skills for the design and integration of systems, the execution of new [[product design]]s, the improvement of manufacturing processes, and the management and direction of physical and/or technical functions of a firm or organization. Applied-engineering degreed programs typically include instruction in basic engineering principles, [[project management]], industrial processes, production and operations management, systems integration and control, quality control, and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://atmae.site-ym.com/?page=AboutATMAE ATMAE Venn Diagram]&lt;/ref&gt;

On completion of an applied engineering program, students will demonstrate the following management competencies that clearly distinguish them from traditional engineering graduates:

• Use appropriate statistical techniques in variable and attribute [[control chart]]s and in sampling tables for continuous improvement.

• Evaluate and/or implement total quality systems in industry.

• Perform [[production scheduling]], develop and monitor an [[inventory control]] system, utilize appropriate [[production planning]] techniques, and identify and exhibit key factors in project management.

• Exhibit knowledge of federal and state safety legislation and identify the role of management in an [[industrial safety]] program.

• Recognize, evaluate and control varied industrial [[health and safety]] hazards.

• Demonstrate knowledge of traditional management functions and practices, including applications and limitations of various management schemes.

• Solve problems in typical industrial organizations, work effectively in teams, and demonstrate knowledge of the managed area of an industrial enterprise.

• Apply business, marketing and economic principles to solve problems.

• Identify responsibility of supervision and management within various industries.

• Demonstrate communication skills, safe and efficient individual and group work habits, leadership within groups and an attitude of cooperation and tolerance.

Applied engineering students specialize with a technical area of study and blend hands-on process experience with theory. Examples of these technical specialties include: [[automation]]/[[robotics]], aviation, computer aided drafting &amp; design, electro-mechanical, [[electronics]], construction, graphic communications, manufacturing, [[nanofabrication]].

Applied engineers are employed in a large and wide-array of industries including: manufacturing, construction, transportation, healthcare, printing/publishing and distribution. They are responsible for implementing a design or process improvement. Although a degree in applied engineering is not considered a traditional [[design engineering]] degree (those eligible to sit for the Professional Engineering Examination), it is quite common for employers to hire applied engineering and technology graduates with the term "engineer" in their job titles. Examples of the use of Applied Engineering titles include: applications engineers, control engineers, manufacturing engineers, process engineers, product engineers, safety engineers, and sales engineers.

Graduates of applied engineering programs are frequently found in management positions due to their coursework, training and experience in [[Mathematics]], economics, statistics, [[financial accounting]], [[operations management]], [[quality management]], industrial safety, and supervision. Common management-related titles may also include: engineering managers, team leaders, plant managers, project managers, supervisors, technical managers.

Applied engineers are prepared to take an engineering design and see it through implementation and execution. They wear many hats in industry, commanding the necessary resources and personnel to contribute to an organization's bottom line.

== Accreditation and certification ==

The [[Association of Technology, Management, and Applied Engineering]] (ATMAE), accredits selected collegiate programs in applied engineering. An instructor or graduate of an applied engineering program may choose to become a certified technology manager (CTM) by sitting for a rigorous exam administered by ATMAE covering [[production planning and control]], safety, quality, and management/supervision.

ATMAE program accreditation is recognized by the [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]] (CHEA) for accrediting Applied Engineering programs. CHEA recognizes ATMAE in the US for accrediting associate, baccalaureate, and master's degree programs in technology, applied technology, engineering technology, and technology-related disciplines delivered by national or regional accredited institutions in the United States.(2011)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf ATMAE Scope of Recognition] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111231001220/http://www.chea.org/pdf/d_Summary%20for%20ATMAE.pdf |date=31 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Backmasking.ogg|thumb|Example of a backmasked recording.]]

'''Backmasking''' is a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique in which a sound or message is recorded backward onto a track that is meant to be played forward. Backmasking is a deliberate process, whereas a message found through [[phonetic reversal]] may be unintentional.

Backmasking was popularised by [[The Beatles]], who used backward instrumentation on their 1966 album ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''.&lt;ref name="sullivan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sullivan |first=Mark |title='More Popular Than Jesus': The Beatles and the Religious Far Right |journal=Popular Music |date=October 1987 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=313–326 |doi=10.1017/S0261143000002348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists have since used backmasking for artistic, comedic and satiric effect, on both analogue and digital recordings. The technique has also been used to censor words or phrases for "clean" releases of [[Profanity|explicit]] songs.

In 1969, rumors of a backmasked message in the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" sparked the [[Paul is dead]] urban legend.&lt;ref name="salon"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.salon.com/2017/06/24/what-exactly-lurks-within-the-backward-grooves-of-stairway-to-heaven/ |title=[Led Zeppelin IV] |last=Erik |first=Davis |date=2005 |work=Salon |publisher=Continuum |isbn=0826416586 |location=New York, NY |language=en-US |oclc=57452450 |access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, Christian groups in the United States alleged that backmasking was being used by prominent [[rock music]]ians for [[satanism|Satanic]] purposes, leading to record-burning protests and proposed anti-backmasking legislation by state and federal governments.&lt;ref&gt;Billiter, Bill (April 28, 1982). "Satanic Messages Played Back for Assembly Panel". ''Los Angeles Times'', page B3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many popular musicians have since been accused of including backmasked messages in their music. However, apparent backmasked messages may in fact be examples of [[pareidolia]] - the brain's tendency to recognize patterns in meaningless data - or coincidental [[phonetic reversal]].&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt;

==History==

===Development===
In 1877, [[Thomas Edison]] invented the [[phonograph]], a device allowing [[sound]] to be [[sound recording and reproduction|recorded and reproduced]] on a rotating cylinder with a [[stylus]] (or "needle") attached to a diaphragm mounted at the narrow end of a horn. [[Emile Berliner]] invented the familiar lateral-cut disc [[gramophone record|phonograph record]] in 1888.

In addition to recreating recorded sounds by placing the stylus on the cylinder or disc and rotating it in the same direction as during the recording, one could hear different sounds by rotating the cylinder or disc backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kittler |first=Friedrick |title=The Gramophone |work=Adventures in CyberSound |publisher=[[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]] |url=http://www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |archive-url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/PHONO_KITTLER.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2004-03-03 |accessdate=2007-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878, Edison noted that, when played backwards, "the song is still melodious in many cases, and some of the strains are sweet and novel, but altogether different from the song reproduced in the right way".{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=48}} The backwards playing of records was advised as training for magicians by occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], who suggested in his 1913 book ''[[Magick (Book 4)]]'' that an [[adept]] "train himself to think backwards by external means", one of which was to "listen to phonograph records, reversed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Crowley |first=Aleister |authorlink=Aleister Crowley |title=[[Magick (Book 4)]] |origyear=1913 |publisher=Weiser |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-87728-919-7 |page=648}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salon" /&gt; In the movie ''[[Gold Diggers of 1935]]'', the end of the dancing pianos musical number "The Words Are in My Heart" is filmed in [[reverse motion]] with the accompanying instrumental score incidentally being reversed.

[[File:Reel-to-reel recorder tc-630.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tape recorder]]s allowed backward recording in [[recording studio]]s]]

The 1950s saw two new developments in audio technology: the development of ''[[musique concrète]]'', an [[avant-garde]] form of [[electronic music]], which involves [[audio engineering|editing]] together fragments of natural and industrial sounds; and the concurrent spread of the use of [[tape recorder]]s in [[recording studio]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=White |first=Ray |title=Musique Concrète |url=http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm |publisher = whitefiles.org | accessdate=2007-11-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071118094321/http://whitefiles.org/rws/rx01.htm| archivedate= November 18, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two trends led to tape music compositions, composed on [[magnetic tape|tape]] using techniques including [[reverse tape effects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Michael |title=The Birth of Loop: A Short History of Looping Music |url=http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html |publisher=loopers-delight.com|accessdate=2007-03-10| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070328220400/http://www.loopers-delight.com/history/Loophist.html| archivedate= March 28, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Beatles]], who incorporated the techniques of ''concrète'' into their recordings, were responsible for popularizing the concept of backmasking.&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt; Singer [[John Lennon]] and producer [[George Martin]] both claimed they discovered the backward recording technique during the recording of 1966's ''[[Revolver (Beatles album)|Revolver]]''; specifically the album tracks "[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]" and "[[I'm Only Sleeping]]", and the single "[[Rain (Beatles song)|Rain]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mugan |first=Chris |title=Subliminal advertising: The voice within |newspaper=The Independent | location = London |date=October 13, 2006 |url=http://arts.independent.co.uk/music/features/article1847509.ece |accessdate=2007-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lennon stated that, while under the influence of [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], he accidentally played the tapes for "Rain" in reverse and enjoyed the sound. The following day he shared the results with the other Beatles, and the effect was used first in the [[guitar solo]] for "Tomorrow Never Knows" and later in the [[Coda (music)|coda]] of "Rain".&lt;ref name="stevens"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stevens |first=John |title=The Songs of John Lennon: The Beatles Years |year=2002 |publisher=Berklee Press |isbn=978-0-634-01795-7 |pages=149, 155–156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Aldridge |first=Alan |title=The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics |year=1991 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |isbn=978-0-395-59426-1 |page=135 |quote=On the end of 'Rain' you hear me singing it backwards. We'd done the main thing at EMI and the habit was then to take the song home and see what you thought a little extra gimmick or what the guitar piece would be. So I got home about five in the morning, stoned out of my head, I staggered up to my tape recorder and I put it on, but it came out backwards, and I was in a trance in the earphones, what is it, what is it. It's too much, you know, and I really wanted the whole song backwards almost, and that was it. So we tagged it on the end.&lt;!-- This quote needs to attributed to the speaker, I assume it was Lennon but have not verified from source --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Martin, the band had been experimenting with changing the speeds of and reversing the "Tomorrow Never Knows" tapes, and Martin got the idea of reversing Lennon's vocals and guitar, which he did with a clip from "Rain". Lennon then liked the effect and kept it.&lt;ref name="ev"&gt;{{cite web |last=Olcott |first=Evan |title=Audio Reversal In Popular Culture |url=http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/ |publisher = Triplo Press | accessdate=2006-08-26|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060821143244/http://www.triplo.com/ev/reversal/ |archivedate = August 21, 2006|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Giuliano |first=Geoffrey |first2=Vrnda |last2= Devi |title=Glass Onion: The Beatles in their own words |year=1999 |publisher=Da Capo Press |isbn=978-0-306-80895-1 |page=265 |quote=I'd introduced John to backwards music on 'Rain' when I took his voice and turned it 'round when he was out on a coffee break.

Rain&amp;nbsp;... When the rain comes, they run and hide their heads" ({{Audio-nohelp|Rain backwards.ogg|listen}}; the last line is the reversed first verse of the song).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cross |first=Craig |title=The Beatles: Day-by-Day, Song-by-Song, Record-by-Record | publisher = iUniverse |year=2005 | location = New York |isbn=978-0-595-34663-9 |page=425}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
The Beatles were involved in the spread of backmasking both as a recording technique and as the center of a [[controversy]]. The latter has its roots in an event in 1969, when [[WNIC|WKNR-FM]] DJ [[Russ Gibb]] received a phone call from a student at [[Eastern Michigan University]] who identified himself as "Tom". The caller asked Gibb about a rumor that Beatle [[Paul McCartney]] [[Paul is dead|had died]], and claimed that the Beatles song "[[Revolution 9]]" contained a backward message confirming the rumor. Gibb played the song backwards on his turntable, and heard "Turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;... turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;... turn me on, dead man&amp;nbsp;...".&lt;ref name="reeve"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reeve |first=Andru J |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man: The Beatles And The "Paul-Is-Dead" Hoax |publisher=AuthorHouse |pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibb began telling his listeners about what he called "The Great Cover-up",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yoakum |first=Jim |title=The Man Who Killed Paul McCartney |journal=[[Gadfly Online|The Gadfly]] |date=May–June 2000 |url=http://www.gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html |accessdate=2007-10-12| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011195426/http://gadflyonline.com/archive/MayJune00/archive-mccartney.html| archivedate= October 11, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to the original clue were added various others, including the alleged backmasked message "Paul is a dead man, miss him, miss him, miss him", in "[[I'm So Tired]]".&lt;ref name="reeve" /&gt;

The "[[Paul is dead]]" rumor popularized the idea of backmasking in [[popular music]].&lt;ref name="sullivan" /&gt; After Gibb's show, many more songs were found to contain phrases that sounded like known spoken languages when reversed. Initially, the search was done mostly by fans of [[rock music]]; but, in the late 1970s,{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} during the rise of the [[Christian right]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden |first=Stephen |title=Serious Issues Underlie a New Album from Styx |publisher=New York Times |date=1983-03-27 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/27/arts/serious-issues-underlie-a-new-album-from-styx.html |accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups began to claim that backmasked messages could bypass the [[Consciousness|conscious mind]] and reach the [[unconscious mind]], where they would be unknowingly accepted by the listener.{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} In 1981, Christian DJ Michael Mills began stating on Christian radio programs that [[Led Zeppelin]]'s "[[Stairway to Heaven]]" contained hidden Satanic messages that were heard by the unconscious.&lt;ref name="davis"&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=David |editor-last= Barker |title=33{{fraction|1|3}} Greatest Hits, Volume One |publisher=Continuum |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-8264-1903-3 |chapter=Led Zeppelin IV |last=Davis |first=Erik |pages=212–214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1982, the [[Trinity Broadcasting Network]]'s [[Paul Crouch]] hosted a show with self-described neuroscientist William Yarroll, who argued that rock stars were cooperating with the [[Church of Satan]] to place hidden subliminal messages on records.{{sfn|Denisoff|1988|p=289}} Also in 1982, fundamentalist Christian pastor Gary Greenwald held public lectures on dangers of backmasking, along with at least one mass record-smashing.&lt;ref name="devil"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vokey |first=John R. |first2=J. Don |last2= Read |title=Subliminal messages: Between the devil and the media |journal=[[American Psychologist]] |date=November 1985 |pages=1231–1239 |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.40.11.1231 |volume=40 |pmid=4083611 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the same year, thirty North Carolina teenagers, led by their pastor, claimed that singers had been possessed by Satan, who used their voices to create backward messages, and held a record-burning at their church.&lt;ref name="robinson"&gt;{{cite web |title=Backmasking on records: Real, or hoax? |last=Robinson |first=B. A |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/chr_cul5.htm |accessdate=2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegations of demonic backmasking were also made by [[social psychology|social psychologists]], parents and critics of rock music,&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite news |last=Searcey |first=Dionne |title=Behind the Music: Sleuths Seek Messages In Lyrical Backspin |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=2006-01-09 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB113677367081541303 |accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] (formed in 1985),&lt;ref name="ev2"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olcott |first=Evan |title=Backwards Messages|journal=Music and Technology |publisher=Triplo Press |url=http://www.triplo.com/ev/column/04.html | accessdate=2007-03-13 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061122142845/http://www.triplo.com/ev/column/04.html |archivedate = 2006-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; which accused Led Zeppelin of using backmasking to promote [[Satanism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cox |first=Edward |title=Popular music restrictions in America in the late 1980s/early 90s |publisher=edcox.net |url=http://www.edcox.net/research/pre/rockmusic.asp |accessdate=2007-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927033409/http://www.edcox.net/research/pre/rockmusic.asp |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation===
One result of the furor was the firing of five radio DJs who had encouraged listeners to search for backward messages in their record collections.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} A more serious consequence was legislation by the state governments of [[Arkansas]] and [[California]]. The 1983 California bill was introduced to prevent backmasking that "can manipulate our behavior without our knowledge or consent and turn us into disciples of the [[Antichrist]]".{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=51}} Involved in the discussion on the bill was a [[California State Assembly]] Consumer Protection and Toxic Materials Committee hearing, during which "Stairway to Heaven" was played backwards, and William Yaroll testified.{{sfn|Denisoff|1988|p=290}} The successful bill made the distribution of records with undeclared backmasking an invasion of privacy for which the distributor could be sued.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt; The Arkansas law passed unanimously in 1983, referenced albums by [[The Beatles]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Electric Light Orchestra]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]],&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; and mandated that records with backmasking include a warning sticker: "Warning: This record contains backward masking which may be perceptible at a subliminal level when the record is played forward." However, the bill was returned to the state senate by Governor [[Bill Clinton]] and defeated.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt; House Resolution 6363, introduced in 1982 by Representative [[Bob Dornan]] (R-California), proposed mandating a similar label;{{sfn|Poundstone|1983|pp=200–14}} the bill was referred to the Subcommittee on Commerce, Transportation and Tourism and was never passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|97|HR|6363}} from [[THOMAS]]&lt;/ref&gt; Government action was also called for in the legislatures of Texas and Canada.&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt;

[[File:Compact Disc.jpg|thumb|right|The [[compact disc]] made finding backward messages difficult, causing interest in backmasking to decline.]]

With the advent of [[compact disc]]s in the 1980s, but prior to the advent of sound editing technology for [[personal computer]]s in the 1990s, it became more difficult to listen to recordings backwards, and the controversy died down.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

===Resurgence===
Although the backmasking controversy peaked in the 1980s, the general belief in subliminal manipulation became more widespread in the United States during the following decade,&lt;ref name="brannon" /&gt; with belief in Satanic backmasking on records persisting into the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first= Kenneth J. |editor-last= Bindas |title=America's Musical Pulse: Popular Music in Twentieth-Century Society|publisher=Praeger |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-275-94306-6 |last=Racocy |first=Rudolf E. |chapter=Introduction: The Importance of Music to People |pages=xvi–xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the development of [[digital audio editor|sound editing software]] with audio reversal features simplified the process of reversing audio,&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; which previously could only be done with full fidelity using a professional tape recorder.{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} The [[Sound Recorder (Windows)|Sound Recorder]] utility, included with [[Microsoft Windows]] from [[Windows 95]] to [[Windows XP]], allows one-click audio reversal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help with Windows Sound Recorder |publisher=Capital Community College |url=http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/dl/dl-help/help-SoundRecorder.htm |accessdate=2007-05-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070429121019/http://www.ccc.commnet.edu/DL/dl-help/help-SoundRecorder.htm| archivedate= April 29, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does popular [[Open-source software|open source]] sound editing software [[Audacity (audio editor)|Audacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Audacity: Features |url=http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about/features|publisher = SourceForge.net | accessdate=2007-05-09| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070504192124/http://audacity.sourceforge.net/about/features| archivedate= May 4, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the growth of the [[Internet]], backmasked message searchers used such software to create websites featuring backward music samples, which became a widely used method of exploring backmasking in popular music.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

In January 2014, the first backmasked video was released as part of a Grammy Awards promotional campaign. A customized video player allowed the user to watch a piece of film accompanied by a music soundtrack both forwards and backwards. The backwards content contained a hidden visual story and the words 'music unleashes you' embedded into the reversed audio track.

[[File:Digital.signal.svg|thumb|right|The switch to [[digital audio]] made recording backmasked messages quicker and easier.]]

Backmasking has been used as a [[sound recording and reproduction|recording]] technique since the 1960s. In the era of [[magnetic tape sound recording]], backmasking required that the source [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape actually be played backwards, which was achieved by first being wound onto the original takeup reel, then reversing the reels so as to use that reel as the source (this would reverse the stereo channels as well). [[Digital audio]] recording has greatly simplified the process.&lt;ref name="radar" /&gt;

Backmasked words are unintelligible noise when played forward, but when played backwards are clear speech.&lt;ref name="robinson" /&gt; Listening to backmasked audio with most [[phonograph|turntables]] requires disengaging the drive and rotating the album by hand in reverse&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; (though some can play records backwards).{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}} With [[magnetic tape]], the tape must be reversed and spliced back into the cassette.&lt;ref name="seattle" /&gt; [[Compact Disc|Compact disc]]s were difficult to reverse when first introduced, but [[digital audio editor]]s, which were first introduced in the late 1980s and became popular during the next decade,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Portable Digital Audio Workstations (Buyer's Guide) |journal=Theatre Crafts International |date=1997-02-01 |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/premium/0286/0286-9303362.html |accessdate=2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; allow easy reversal of audio from digital sources.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;

===Satanic backmasking===
In the 1973 film ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', a tape of noises from the possessed victim was discovered to contain a message when the tape was played backwards. This scene might have inspired subsequent copycat musical effects.
Although the Satanic backmasking controversy involved mainly [[classic rock]] songs, whose authors denied any intent to promote [[Satanism]], backmasking has been used by [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands to deliberately insert messages in their lyrics or imagery. Bands have utilized Satanic imagery for commercial reasons.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=52}} For example, [[thrash metal]] band [[Slayer]] included at the start of the band's 1985 album ''[[Hell Awaits]]'' a deep backmasked voice chanting "Join Us" over and over ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenson |first=K.

When played backwards, the songs "665" and "667" reveal a song about [[Santa Claus]].
[[Marilyn Manson]] used this technique. For example, in the beginning of his song "Tourniquet" when played backwards, his voice is heard saying "This is my lowest point of vulnerability" as explained in his book ''[[The Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]''.

===Aesthetic use===
Backmasking is often used for aesthetics, i.e., to enhance the meaning or sound of a track.{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} During the [[Judas Priest]] subliminal message trial, lead singer [[Rob Halford]] admitted to recording the words "In the dead of the night, love bites" backwards into the track "Love Bites", from the 1984 album ''[[Defenders of the Faith]]''. Asked why he recorded the message, Halford stated that "When you're composing songs, you're always looking for new ideas, new sounds."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judas Priest's lead singer testifies |newspaper=New York Times |date=August 1, 1990 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/08/01/arts/judas-priest-s-lead-singer-testifies.html?sec=health |accessdate=2007-04-20 |agency= Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanley Kubrick]] used "Masked Ball", an adaptation by [[Jocelyn Pook]] of her earlier work "Backwards Priests" (from the album Flood) featuring reversed [[Romanian language|Romanian]] chanting, as the background music for the [[masquerade ball]] scene in ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Zwerin |title=Kubrick's approval sets seal on classical crossover success: Pook's unique musical mix |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/27/style/27iht-pook.t.html |work=[[International Herald Tribune]] | location = Paris |date=October 27, 1999 |accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of "[[Before I Forget (song)|Before I Forget]]" by [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], lead singer [[Corey Taylor]]'s voice can be heard saying "...&amp;nbsp;You're wasting it" which is in reference to how [[Rick Rubin]], the producer of their album ''[[Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses]]'', wanted Taylor to change the chorus vocal melody because he felt it wasn't catchy; however, Taylor stood his ground and the chorus stayed unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;"Corey Taylor Interview at 98 KUPD".

One backmasking technique is to reverse an earlier part of a song. [[Missy Elliott]] used this technique in one of her songs, "[[Work It (Missy Elliott song)|Work It]]",&lt;ref name="rap"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Rap/Hip Hop |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/rap.html |accessdate=2006-08-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060311023706/http://www.backmaskonline.com/rap.html| archivedate = March 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Jay Chou]] ("[[You Can Hear]]", from ''[[Ye Hui Mei]]''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jay Chou FAQ |publisher=Jay-Chou.net |url=http://www.jay-chou.net/forums/faq.php?faq=new_faq_item2 |accessdate=2006-06-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060628030930/http://www.jay-chou.net/forums/faq.php?faq=new_faq_item2 |archivedate=June 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[At the Drive-In]] ("[[300&amp;nbsp;MHz]]", from ''[[Vaya (EP)|Vaya]]''),&lt;ref name="modernrock"&gt;{{cite web |last=Corbin |first=Dean |title=Modern Rock |publisher=Backmask Online |url=http://www.backmaskonline.com/modernrock.html |accessdate=2006-08-06| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060526195316/http://www.backmaskonline.com/modernrock.html| archivedate = May 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lacuna Coil]] ("[[Self Deception]]", from ''[[Comalies]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lacuna Coil—Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Emptyspiral.net—The Lacuna Coil Community |date=October 12, 2006 |url=http://emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=69 |accessdate=2006-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707120824/http://emptyspiral.net/modules.php?name=Content&amp;pa=showpage&amp;pid=69 |archivedate=July 7, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; A related technique is to reverse an entire instrumental track. [[John Lennon]] originally wanted to do so with "[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]", but objections by producer [[George Martin]] and bandmate [[Paul McCartney]] cut the backward section to 30 seconds.&lt;ref name="stevens" /&gt; [[The Stone Roses]] have made heavy use of this technique in songs including "[[Don't Stop (Stone Roses song)|Don't Stop]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pomroy |first=Matt |title=The Stone Roses: self-titled |date=October 22, 2002 |publisher=[[PopMatters]] |url=http://www.popmatters.com/music/reviews/s/stoneroses-st.shtml |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Guernica (song)|Guernica]]", and "[[Simone (song)|Simone]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Brown |first=Ian |interviewer=Adam Walton |date=February 2, 2000|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2011/11/ian-brown-stone-roses-interview-2000.shtml|accessdate=2012-01-25|title=I've only served eight weeks, I can't really write a concept album about jail |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20111112003944/http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/walesmusic/2011/11/ian-brown-stone-roses-interview-2000.shtml |archivedate= November 12, 2011 |publisher= BBC |work= Wales Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are all backwards versions of other Stone Roses tracks, sometimes overdubbed with new vocals that sound somewhat similar to the initial track when backmasked. Meanwhile, [[Klaatu (band)|Klaatu]] used the reversed vocals from "[[Anus of Uranus]]" (from their first album, ''[[3:47 EST]]'') as the vocals for the song "[[Silly Boys]]" (on their third album, ''[[Sir Army Suit]]''). The lyrics for "Silly Boys" on the lyric sheet from ''Sir Army Suit'' are accordingly printed backwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bradley |first=David |title=Klaatu Identities and Beatles Rumors |url=http://www.klaatu.org/klaatu1.html |date=January 24, 2004 |work=The Official Klaatu Homepage |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Danish people|Danish]] band [[Mew (band)|Mew]]'s 2009 album ''[[No More Stories...]]'' contains a track, "New Terrain", which, when listened to in reverse, reveals a new song, entitled "Nervous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Terrain / Nervous |publisher=MewX |date=July 28, 2009 |url=http://www.mewx.info/wp/?p=464 |accessdate=2009-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When done on tape, such use of backmasking is known as ''[[reverse tape effects]]''. One example is [[Matthew Sweet]]'s 1999 album ''[[In Reverse]]'', which includes reversed guitar parts which were played directly onto a tape running in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Simons |first=David |title=Matthew Sweet: Rebuilding the Wall of Sound |journal=[[Guitar Player]] |date=January 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For live concerts, the guitar parts were played live on stage using a backward emulator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Simons |first=David |title=Back on the bus |magazine=Onstage |date=January 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humorous and parody messages===
[[File:Sox Satanic Subliminals.png|thumb|right|The manual for the popular sound program [[SoX]] includes the "reverse" option "for finding Satanic subliminals"]]

A common use of backmasking is hiding a comedic or parodical message backwards in a song. The [[B-side]] of the 1966 [[Napoleon XIV]] single "[[They're Coming to Take Me Away, Ha-Haaa!]]" is a reversed version of the entire forwards record, titled "!aaaH-aH ,yawA eM ekaT oT gnimoC er'yehT". The forward version reached #3 in the US charts and #4 in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= They're Coming To Take Me Away, Ha-haaa by Napoleon XIV |editor-last= Wiser |editor-first= Carl |work=Songfacts |publisher= songfacts.com |url= http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=675 |accessdate= 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[WWE]] wrestler [[Al Snow]] had a theme song that had backmasking in it. The song was mostly instrumental, but at one point a clearly audible voice can be heard saying a line of gibberish. When the song is played backward, the gibberish is actually saying "I AM THE ONE IN CONTROL". The message played on Al Snow's character as an unstable mad man.

[[The Beatles]] song "[[Free as a Bird]]" was originally composed and recorded in 1977 as a home demo by John Lennon.  In 1995 a studio version of the recording, incorporating contributions from Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, was released as a new single from ''The Beatles Anthology 1'' project, 25 years after their break-up and 15 years after Lennon's death.  In a humorous self-parody and tribute to Lennon, the surviving Beatles inserted a backmasked clip of Lennon saying "Turned out nice again" at the very end of the song.

[[Pink Floyd]] dropped a backmasked message into "[[Empty Spaces]]":
* ''...&amp;nbsp;Congratulations. You have just discovered the secret message. Please send your answer to Old Pink, care of the Funny Farm, Chalfont&amp;nbsp;...''
* ''Roger! Carolyne's on the phone!''
* ''Okay.''

The first line may refer to former lead singer [[Syd Barrett]], who is thought to have suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] years earlier.{{sfn|Patterson|2004|p=186}} The first known instance of Pink Floyd having a backwards message is on the song "[[Bike (song)|Bike]]". When played backward, it produces a nonsense poem.

In [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]'s "Nature Trail to Hell", from 1984's ''[["Weird Al" Yankovic in 3-D]]'', Yankovic's backmasked voice declares that "[[Satan]] eats [[Cheez Whiz]]" ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; Another early example can be found on [[the J. Geils Band]] track "No Anchovies, Please", from 1980s album ''[[Love Stinks (album)|Love Stinks]]''. The message, disguised as a foreign-sounding language spoken under the narration, is, "It doesn't take a genius to tell the difference between chicken shit and chicken salad."{{sfn|Poundstone|1986|pp= 227–32}}
Belgian act [[Poésie Noire]] included a satirical backmasked message on their 1988 album ''Tetra'' saying "You fucking asshole, play the record in the normal way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.poesienoire.com/php/matrix.php?action=listall |title= Poésie Noire - The Matrix |work= poesienoire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tenacious D]] includes the backmasked message "Eat Donkey Crap" at the end of "Karate" from their self-titled first album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Marshall |first=Steve |title=Tenacious D: Tenacious D (Epic) |work= The Night Owl |publisher= thenightowl.com |year=2001 |url=http://www.thenightowl.com/reviews/tenacious.htm |accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]], following their involvement in the 1980s backmasking controversy, released songs that parody the allegations made against them. ELO, after being accused of Satanic backmasking on their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]'', included backmasked messages in two songs on their next album, 1975's ''[[Face the Music (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Face The Music]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Michel |first=Rob |title=1974: Electric Light Orchestra: Eldorado |work=Counting Out Time |publisher=Dutch Progressive Rock Page |date=August 2002 |url=http://www.dprp.net/proghistory/index.php?i=1974_03 |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Down Home Town]]" begins with a voice twice repeating (in reverse) "Face the mighty waterfall".&lt;ref name="elo"&gt;{{cite web |title=Secret Messages |work=My Electric Light Orchestra Fan Site |publisher=FutureBright |url=http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm |accessdate=2006-07-27| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060828074741/http://elo.futurebright.com/Secrets.htm| archivedate= August 28, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the opening instrumental "[[Fire On High]]" contains the backmasked message "The music is reversible, but time is not.

Some messages chastise or poke fun at the listener who is playing the song backwards. One such message was included by "Weird Al" Yankovic in "[[I Remember Larry]]", from the 1996 album ''[[Bad Hair Day]]'', on which Yankovic lightly chastises the listener with the backmasked remark, "Wow, [you] must have an awful lot of free time on your hands" ({{Audio-nohelp||listen}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Lick |first=Marty "Gumby" |author2="Happy Steve" Chai| title="Weird Al" Yankovic Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Al-oholics Anonymous |url=http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html |accessdate=2007-03-17| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070210010935/http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/faq/index.html| archivedate= February 10, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[The B-52's|B-52's]] song "Detour Through your Mind", from the 1986 LP ''[[Bouncing off the Satellites]]'', contains the message, "I buried my parakeet in the backyard.

[[Devo]]'s hit song "[[Whip It (Devo song)|Whip It]]" has [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] saying "Hey come over here!" when the song is played backwards.

Backmasking was also parodied in a 2001 episode of the television series ''[[The Simpsons]]'' titled "[[New Kids on the Blecch]]." [[Bart Simpson]] joins a [[boy band]] called the Party Posse, whose song "Drop Da Bomb" includes the repeated lyric "Yvan eht nioj." [[Lisa Simpson]] becomes suspicious and plays the song backward, revealing the backmasked message "Join the Navy", which leads her to realize that the boy band was created as a subliminal recruiting tool for the United States Navy.

The [[Futurama]] episode [[Calculon 2.0]] also has a scene where an installation disc is played backward on what looks like an old fashioned gramophone player, with the words "rise from the dead in the name of Satan" coming from it.

===Critical or explicit messages===
[[File:Zappa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Frank Zappa]] used backmasking to avoid censorship.]]

Backmasking has also been used to record statements perhaps too critical or explicit to be used forwards. Frank Zappa used backmasking to avoid censorship of the track "[[Hot Poop]]", from ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'' (1968). The released version contains at the end of its side "A" the backmasked message "Better look around before you say you don't care. / Shut your fucking mouth 'bout the length of my hair. / How would you survive / If you were alive / shitty little person?" This profanity-laced verse, originally from the song "Mother People", was censored by Verve Records, so Zappa edited the verse out, reversed it, and inserted it elsewhere in the album as "Hot Poop" (though even in the backward message the word "fucking" is censored).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=We're Only In It for the Money |last=Pacholski |first=Luke |url=http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html |publisher=lukpac.org |accessdate=2006-07-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060718065134/http://www.lukpac.org/~handmade/patio/vinylvscds/money.html| archivedate= July 18, 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same album, a modified backmasking can be heard in "[[Harry, You're a Beast]]" with Madge saying, "Don't come in me, in me" repeatedly before she starts crying. In at least one bootleg version of the album, these words are very clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frank Zappa - Bootleg (We're only in it for the money 1967) Parte2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OAEyXHOY0qk|website=youtube.com|accessdate=1 August 2016|date=Oct 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is found in [[Roger Waters]]' 1992 album ''[[Amused to Death]]'', on which Waters recorded a backward message, possibly critical of film director [[Stanley Kubrick]], who had refused to let Waters sample a breathing sound from ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Simon |first=Michael |title=Amused To Death Trivia |publisher=Roger Waters International Fan Club |url=http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |accessdate=2007-03-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208094658/http://www.rogerwaters.org/atdtrivia.html |archivedate=February 8, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The message appears in the song "[[Perfect Sense Part 1]]", in which Waters' backmasked voice says, "Julia, however, in light and visions of the issues of Stanley, we have changed our minds.

A further use of backmasking is to [[censorship|censor]] words and phrases deemed inappropriate on [[radio edit]]s and "[[Expurgation|clean]]" album releases.&lt;ref name="nelson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson |first=Chris |title=Sticker Ban Policy: Family Values Or Consumer Fraud? |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=1998-09-08 |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |accessdate=2007-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001091203/http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/501064/19980908/story.jhtml |archivedate=October 1, 2007 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[The Fugees]]' clean version of the album ''[[The Score (Fugees album)|The Score]]'' contains various backmasked [[profanity|profanities]];&lt;ref name="nelson" /&gt; thus, when playing the album backwards, the censored words are clearly audible among the backward gibberish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=mcc |publisher=[[Everything2]] |title=Music that sounds better backward than forward |url=http://everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=677630 |accessdate=2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used with the word "shit", this type of backmasking results in a sound similar to "ish". As a result, "[[wikt:ish|ish]]" became a [[euphemism]] for "shit".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |editor-last=Rader |editor-first= Walter |work=The Online Slang Dictionary |author= Emily M. |origyear= November 12, 1997 |date= March 5, 2011 |url= http://onlineslangdictionary.com/definition+of/ish |title= Definition of ish: noun |accessdate= 2014-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Britney Spears]]' 2011 song "[[Till The World Ends]]", Spears says "if you want this good shit". However, on the official version, "shit" is reversed, creating the "ish" sound; therefore, the official version says "if you want this good ish". Backmasking is also used to censor the word "[[joint (cannabis)|joint]]" in the video for "[[You Don't Know How It Feels]]" by [[Tom Petty]], resulting in the line "Let's roll another tnioj".&lt;ref name="TomPettySun"&gt;{{cite web

[[Electric Light Orchestra]] was accused of hiding a backward Satanic message in their 1974 album ''[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra album)|Eldorado]]''. The title track, "[[Eldorado (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Eldorado]]", was said to contain the message "He is the nasty one / Christ, you're infernal / It is said we're dead men / Everyone who has the mark will live."{{sfn|Poundstone|1983|pp=200–14}} ELO singer and songwriter [[Jeff Lynne]] responded by calling this accusation (and the related charge of being "devil-worshippers") "[[bollocks|skcollob]]",&lt;ref name="ftm"&gt;{{cite web |title=Electric Light Orchestra Biogs |publisher=Face The Music |url=http://www.ftmusic.com/biogs/elo/elo_biog.html |accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stating that the message "is absolutely manufactured by whoever said, 'That's what it said.' It doesn't say anything of the sort."{{sfn|Patterson|2004|p=174}} The group included several backward messages in later albums in response to the accusations.

In 1981, [[Styx (band)|Styx]] was accused of putting the backward message "Satan move through our voices" on the song "[[Snowblind (Styx song)|Snowblind]]", from ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theatre]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Guitarist [[James Young (American musician)|James Young]] called these charges "rubbish,"&lt;ref name="arar"&gt;{{cite news |last=Arar |first=Yardena |title=Satanic records or balderdash: Just what the devil's going on? |newspaper=The Daily Herald | location = Arlington Heights, IL |date=May 26, 1982 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and responded, "If we want to make a statement, we'll do it in a way that people can understand us and not in a way where you have to go out and buy a $400 tape player to understand us." The vinyl reproduction of ''[[Paradise Theatre (album)|Paradise Theater]]'' had laser etching on side one, spelling out Styx at the top, and two ladies facing each other on the sides. But on side two, the side with the song (Snow Blind) it had a black label with a small hole cut out where you could place the eraser side of a pencil, and play the album backwards to hear the backward message.&lt;ref name="kilroy"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hoekstra |first=Dave |title=Styx makes a statement |newspaper=Suburban Sun-Times | location = Chicago |date=April 1, 1983 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the band released a concept album, ''[[Kilroy Was Here (album)|Kilroy Was Here]]'', satirizing the [[Moral Majority]].

A well-known alleged message is found in rock group [[Led Zeppelin]]'s 1971 song "[[Stairway to Heaven]]". The backwards playing of a portion of the song purportedly results in words beginning with "Here's to my sweet Satan" ({{Audio-nohelp|STH reverse.ogg|listen}}).&lt;ref name="milner"&gt;{{cite web |last=Milner |first=Jeff |title=Jeff Milner's Backmasking Site |url=http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm |publisher = jeffmilner.com |accessdate=2007-03-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070314014834/http://jeffmilner.com/backmasking.htm| archivedate= March 14, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swan Song Records]] issued a statement to the contrary: "Our turntables only play in one direction—forwards."&lt;ref name="davis" /&gt; Led Zeppelin vocalist [[Robert Plant]] denied the accusations in an interview: "To me it's very sad, because 'Stairway To Heaven' was written with every best intention, and as far as reversing tapes and putting messages on the end, that's not my idea of making music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Plant |first=Robert |subjectlink=Robert Plant |interviewer=J.D.

===Subliminal persuasion===
{{further|Subliminal message}}

====Fundamentalist Christian groups====
Various [[fundamentalist Christian]] groups have declared that Satan—or Satan-influenced musicians—use backmasked messages to subliminally alter behavior. Pastor Gary Greenwald claimed that subliminal messages backmasked into rock music induce listeners towards sex and drug use.{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=258}} Minister Jacob Aranza wrote in his 1982 book ''Backward Masking Unmasked'' that rock groups "are using backmasking to convey satanic and drug related messages to the subconscious."{{sfn|Blecha|2004|p=49}} Christian DJ Michael Mills argued in 1981 that "the subconscious mind is being successfully affected by the repetition of beat and lyrics—being affected through a subliminal message."&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Michael. [http://blog.wfmu.org/freeform/2007/01/365_days_1_the_.html Hidden and Satanic Messages In Rock Music]. Radio interview, 1981, blog.wfmu.org. [http://blogfiles.wfmu.org/DP/2007/01/001_Michael_Mills_01_Introduction.mp3 Introduction], at 1:22&lt;/ref&gt; Mills has toured America warning Christian parents about subliminal messages in [[rock music]].&lt;ref name="devil" /&gt;

Some Christian websites have claimed that backmasking is widely used for Satanic purposes.&lt;ref name="robinson" /&gt; The web page for Alabama group [[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] argues for the existence of Satanic backmasking in "[[Stairway to Heaven]]", saying that the song contains the backward message, "It's my sweet Satan&amp;nbsp;... Oh I will sing because I live with Satan."&lt;ref name="watkins" /&gt;

====PMRC====
In 1985, Joe Stuessy testified to the [[United States Congress]] at the [[Parents Music Resource Center]] hearings that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The message [of a piece of heavy metal music] may also be covert or subliminal. Sometimes subaudible tracks are mixed in underneath other, louder tracks. These are heard by the subconscious but not the conscious mind. Sometimes the messages are audible but are backward, called backmasking. There is disagreement among experts regarding the effectiveness of subliminals. We need more research on that.&lt;ref name="pmrc"&gt;{{citation |author= United States Senate |year= 1985 |url= http://www.joesapt.net/superlink/shrg99-529/ |title= Record Labeling: Hearing before the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation |work= United States Senate, Ninety-ninth Congress, First Session on Contents of Music and the Lyrics of Records (September 19, 1985) |location= Washington, DC |publisher= U.S. Government Printing Office |pages= 118–25 |via= Joesapt.net |accessdate= 2007-06-09 |postscript= .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Stuessy's written testimony stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Some messages are presented to the listener backwards. While listening to a normal forward message (often somewhat nonsensical), one is simultaneously being treated to a backwards message (in other words, the lyric sounds like one set of words going forward, and a different set of words going backwards). Some experts believe that while the conscious mind is absorbing the forward lyric, the subconscious is working overtime to decipher the backwards message.&lt;ref name="pmrc" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Court cases====
Serial killer [[Richard Ramirez]], on trial in 1988, stated that [[AC/DC]]'s music, and specifically the song "[[Night Prowler]]" on ''[[Highway to Hell (album)|Highway to Hell]]'', inspired him to commit murder.&lt;ref name="watkins"&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Terry |title=Rock Music: The Devil's Advocate |publisher=[[Dial-the-Truth Ministries]] |url=http://www.av1611.org/rock.html |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reverse speech]] advocate [[David John Oates]] claimed that "[[Highway to Hell (song)|Highway to Hell]]", on the same album, contains backmasked messages including "I'm the law", "my name is Lucifer", and "she belongs in hell".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Von Ulrich |first=Meyerratken |url=http://www.reversespeech.com/esotera.htm |title=Untitled |work=reversespeech.com |others=Edited by George, Michael, translated from German by Galbraith, Evan |accessdate=2007-03-17 |postscript=. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230184800/http://www.reversespeech.com/esotera.htm |archivedate=December 30, 2006 |df=mdy }} Originally published in ''Esotera'' magazine (June 1997).&lt;/ref&gt; AC/DC's [[Angus Young]] responded that "you didn't need to play [the album] backwards, because we never hid [the messages].

In 1990, British [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] band [[Judas Priest]] was sued over a [[suicide pact]] made by two young men in [[Nevada]]. The lawsuit by their families claimed that the 1978 Judas Priest album ''[[Stained Class]]'' contained hidden messages, including the forward subliminal words "Do it" in the song "[[Better By You, Better Than Me]]" (a cover version of a [[Spooky Tooth]] song), and various backward subliminal messages. The case was dismissed by the judge for insufficient evidence of Judas Priest's placement of subliminal messages on the record,{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=261}} and the judge's ruling stated that "The scientific research presented does not establish that subliminal stimuli, even if perceived, may precipitate conduct of this magnitude. There exist other factors which explain the conduct of the deceased independent of the subliminal stimuli."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sophia |first=Cassiel |title=Subliminal Suicide? |publisher=Metareligion |url=http://www.meta-religion.com/Secret_societies/Conspiracies/Mind_Control/subliminal_suicide.htm |accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judas Priest members commented that if they wanted to insert subliminal commands in their music, messages leading to the deaths of their fans would be counterproductive, and they would prefer to insert the command "Buy more of our records."&lt;ref&gt;Van Taylor, David. KNPB Channel 5 Public Broadcasting, 1982: ''Dream Deceivers: The Story Behind James Vance Vs. Judas Priest''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skepticism===
[[Skepticism|Skeptic]] [[Michael Shermer]] claims that the emergence of the "[[Paul is dead]]" phenomenon, including the alleged message at the end of "[[I'm So Tired]]", was caused by faulty perception of a pattern. Shermer argues that the human brain evolved with a strong [[pattern recognition]] ability that was necessary to process the large amount of [[noise]] in man's environment, but that today this ability leads to [[false positive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Shermer |first=Michael |title=Turn Me On, Dead Man |date=May 2005 |work =Scientific American |url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=turn-me-on-dead-man|accessdate=2012-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stanford University]] psychology professor Brian Wandell postulates that the observance of backward messages is a mistake arising from this pattern recognition facility, and argues that subliminal persuasion theories are "bizarre" and "implausible."&lt;ref name="seattle"&gt;{{cite news |last=Holguin |first=Jaime |title=Backmasking unmasked!

Eric Borgos of audio reversal website talkbackwards.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.talkbackwards.com/ |title= Backmasking and Reverse Speech |work= TalkBackwards.com |accessdate= 2007-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that "Mathematically, if you listen long enough, eventually you'll find a pattern",&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; while Jeff Milner&lt;ref name="milner" /&gt; recounts, "Most people, when I show them the site, say that they're not able to hear anything, until, of course, I show them the reverse lyrics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hopper |first=Tristin |title=Student sets up "backmasking" website |date=January 26, 2006 |work=The Charlatan | location = Carleton University, Ottawa |url=http://www.charlatan.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16842&amp;Itemid=27 |accessdate=2007-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audio engineer Evan Olcott claims that messages by artists including Queen and Led Zeppelin are coincidental [[phonetic reversal]]s, in which the spoken or sung [[phoneme]]s form new combinations of words when listened to backwards.&lt;ref name="ev" /&gt; Olcott states that "Actually engineering or planning a phonetic reversal is next to impossible, and even more difficult when trying to design it with words that fit into a song."&lt;ref name="ev2" /&gt;

In 1985, University of Lethbridge psychologists John Vokey and J. Don Read conducted a study using [[Psalm 23]] from the [[Bible]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s "[[Another One Bites the Dust]]", and other sound passages made up for the experiment. Vokey and Read concluded that if backmasking does exist, it is ineffective. Participants had trouble noticing backmasked phrases when the samples were played forwards, were unable to judge the types of messages (Christian, Satanic, or commercial), and were not led to behave in a certain way as a result of being exposed to the backmasked phrases. Vokey concluded that "we could find no effect of the meaning of engineered, backward messages on listeners' behaviour, either consciously or unconsciously."{{sfn|Vokey|2005|p=260}} Similar results to Vokey and Read's were obtained by D. Averill in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Averill |first=D. |date=September 12, 1982 |title=Did the Devil make you do it? |newspaper =Tulsa World |location = Oklahoma |page=17}} Cited in {{Harvnb|Zusne &amp; Jones|1989|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1988 experiment by T.E.

The finding of backward Satanic messages has been explained as caused by the [[observer-expectancy effect]]. The ''[[Skeptic's Dictionary]]'' states that "you probably won't hear [backmasked] messages until somebody first points them out to you. Perception is influenced by expectation and expectation is affected by what others prime you for."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Carroll |first=Robert Todd |authorlink=Robert Todd Carroll |chapter= Backwards satanic messages (backmasking) |title= The Skeptic's Dictionary |edition= online |date=December 28, 2006 |url=http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html |accessdate=2007-04-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070501094630/http://www.skepdic.com/backward.html| archivedate= May 1, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, S.

'''Biostasis''' is the ability of an [[organism]] to tolerate environmental changes without having to actively adapt to them. Biostasis is found in organisms that live in habitats that likely encounter unfavorable living conditions, such as drought, freezing temperatures, change in pH levels, pressure, or temperature. Insects undergo a type of dormancy to survive these conditions, called [[diapause]]. Diapause may be obligatory for these insects to survive. The insect may also be able to undergo change prior to the arrival of the initiating event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.iwu.edu/~tardisdp/tardigrade_facts.html | title=Tardigrade Facts | author=Karen Lindahl and Susie Balser | date=2 October 1999 | publisher=Illinois Wesleyan University | access-date=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biostasis is also used as a synonym for the terms [[Cryopreservation|cryostasis]] or [[cryonics]]. Cryonics is a  medical procedure concept that is a well established trope in [[Suspended animation in fiction|Science Fiction]], that may at some point in the future become a possible option for individuals who are terminally ill. The patients would be frozen in what is known as cryonic suspension. The patients are frozen so that when technology advances both to enable them to be unfrozen and brought back to life but also for their illness to be treated, they can be re-animated and their disease can be cured or treated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Merkle|first=R.C.|date=September 1992|title=The technical feasibility of cryonics|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/030698779290133W|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=39|pages=6–16|doi=10.1016/0306-9877(92)90133-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable medical source|date=November 2017}}

Biostasis is also synonymous for '''Viable but Nonculturable state'''. In the past when bacteria were no longer growing on culture media it was assumed that they were dead. Now we can understand that there are many instances where bacteria cells may go into biostasis or suspended animation, fail to grow on media, and on resuscitation are again culturable. It should be noted that VBNC state differs from 'starvation survival state' (where a cell just reduces metabolism significantly). Bacteria cells may enter the VBNC state as a result of some outside stressor such as "starvation, incubation outside the temperature range of growth, elevated osmotic concentrations (seawater), oxygen concentrations, or exposure to white light" (9). Any of these instances could very easily mean death for the bacteria if it was not able to enter this state of dormancy. It has also been observed that in may instances where it was thought that bacteria had been destroyed (pasteurization of milk) and later caused spoilage or harmful effects to consumers because the bacteria had entered the VBNC state.

Effects on cells entering the VBNC state include "dwarfing, changes in metabolic activity, reduced nutrient transport, respiration rates and macromolecular synthesis". (9) Yet biosynthesis continues, and shock proteins are made. Most importantly has been observed that ATP levels and generation remain high, completely contrary to dying cells which show rapid decreases in generation and retention. Changes to the cell walls of bacteria in the VBNC state have also been observed. In E.coli a large amount of cross-linking was observed in the peptidoglycan. The autolytic capability was also observed to be much higher in VBNC cells than those who where in the growth state.

It should be noted that is far easier to induce bacteria to the VBNC state and once bacteria cells have entered the VBNC state it is very hard to return them to a culturable state. "They examined nonculturability and resuscitation in &lt;u&gt;Legionella Pneumophila&lt;/u&gt; and while entry into this state was easily induced by nutrient starvation, resuscitation could only be demonstrated following co-incubation of the VBNC cells with the amoeba, &lt;u&gt;Acanthamoeba Castellani&lt;/u&gt;" (9)

'''Fugistasis''' or mycostasis a naturally occurring VBNC (Viable but Nonculturable) state found in fungi in soil. Watson and Ford defined fungistasis as "when viable fungal propagules, which are not subject to endogenous or constitutive dormancy do not germinate in soil at their favorable temperature or moisture conditions or growth of fungal hyphae is retarded or terminated by conditions of the soil environment other than temperature or moisture." (10). Essentially (and mostly observed naturally occurring in soil) several types of fungi have been found to enter the VBNC state resulting from outside stressors (temperature, available nutrients, oxygen availability ect.) or from no observable stressors at all.

== Current Research ==
On March 1, 2018, the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA) announced their new Biostasis program under the direction of Dr. Tristan McClure-Begley. The aim of the Biostasis program is to develop new possibilities for extending the [[Golden hour (medicine)|golden hour]] in patients who suffered a traumatic injury by slowing down the human body at the cellular level, addressing the need for additional time in continuously operating biological systems faced with catastrophic, life-threatening events. By leveraging molecular biology, the program aims to control the speed at which living systems operate and figure out a way to "slow life to save life."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2018-03-01|title=Slowing Biological Time to Extend the Golden Hour for Lifesaving Treatment|website=www.darpa.mil|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2018, the Biostasis team held a [[Webinar]] which, along with a [[Broad Agency Announcement]] (BAA), solicited five-year research proposals from outside organizations. The full proposals were due on May 22, 2018.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.darpa.mil/attachments/Biostasis%20Webinar_Full%20Deck_For%20Posting.pdf|title=Rapid Threat Assessment (RTA)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.darpa.mil|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Possible Approaches ===
In their [[Web conferencing|Webinar]], [[DARPA]] outlined a number of possible research approaches for the Biostasis project. These approaches are based on research into [[diapause]] in [[tardigrade]]s and [[wood frog]]s which suggests that selective stabilization of intracellular machinery occurs at the [[protein]] level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Protein Chaperoning ====
In molecular biology, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] are proteins that assist in the folding, unfolding, assembly, or disassembly of other [[Macromolecule|macromolecular]] structures. Under typical conditions, [[Chaperone (protein)|molecular chaperones]] facilitate changes in shape ([[conformational change]]) of [[macromolecule]]s in response to changes in environmental factors like [[temperature]], [[pH]], and [[voltage]]. By reducing conformational flexibility, scientists can constrain the function of certain proteins.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Recent research has shown that proteins are promiscuous, or able to do jobs in addition to the ones they evolved to carry out.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sciencealert.com/the-apromiscuousa-protein|title=The 'Promiscuous' Protein|last=University|first=Massey|work=ScienceAlert|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, protein promiscuity plays a key role in the adaptation of species to new environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; It is possible that finding a way to control [[conformational change]] in promiscuous proteins could allow scientists to induce biostasis in living organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Intracellular Crowding ====
The crowdedness of cells is a critical aspect of biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2012/10/how-intracellular-crowding-changes-everything/|title=How Intracellular Crowding Changes Everything|work=WIRED|access-date=2018-05-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intracellular crowding refers to the fact that protein function and interaction with water is constrained when the interior of the cell is overcrowded.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Intracellular [[organelle]]s are either membrane-bound vesicles or membrane-less compartments that compartmentalize the cell and enable [[Spatiotemporal pattern|spatiotemporal]] control of biological reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brangwynne|first=Clifford P.|last2=Tompa|first2=Peter|last3=Pappu|first3=Rohit V.|date=2015-11-03|title=Polymer physics of intracellular phase transitions|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nphys3532|journal=Nature Physics|language=En|volume=11|issue=11|pages=899–904|doi=10.1038/nphys3532|issn=1745-2473}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By introducing these intracellular [[polymer]]s to a biological system and manipulating the crowdedness of a cell, scientists may be able to slow down the rate of biological reactions in the system.

==== Tardigrade-disordered Proteins ====
[[Tardigrade]]s are [[Micro-animal|microscopic animals]] that are able to enter a state of [[diapause]] and survive a remarkable array of environmental stressors, including [[freezing]] and [[desiccation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Research has shown that [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] in these organisms may work to stabilize cell function and protect against these extreme environmental stressors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boothby|first=Thomas C.|last2=Tapia|first2=Hugo|last3=Brozena|first3=Alexandra H.|last4=Piszkiewicz|first4=Samantha|last5=Smith|first5=Austin E.|last6=Giovannini|first6=Ilaria|last7=Rebecchi|first7=Lorena|last8=Pielak|first8=Gary J.|last9=Koshland|first9=Doug|date=2017|title=Tardigrades Use Intrinsically Disordered Proteins to Survive Desiccation|url=https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(17)30133-8|journal=Molecular Cell|language=English|volume=65|issue=6|pages=975–984.e5|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2017.02.018|issn=1097-2765|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[peptide]] engineering, it is possible that scientists may be able to introduce [[intrinsically disordered proteins]] to the biological systems of larger animal organisms.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This could allow larger animals to enter a state of biostasis similar to that of [[tardigrade]]s under extreme biological stress.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2067">The Chicago Lake Tunnel was the first of several tunnels built from the city of [[Chicago]]'s shore on [[Lake Michigan]] two miles out into the lake to access the fresh unpolluted fresh water far from the city's sewage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://civil.lindahall.org/lake_tunnel.shtml/ |title=The Lake Tunnel in Chicago |publisher=Linda Hall Library of Science, Engineering &amp; Technology |date=28 October 2002 |website=Linda Hall Library |access-date=30 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160529051806/http://civil.lindahall.org/lake_tunnel.shtml |archivedate=29 May 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early decades of its existence, Chicago suffered numerous widespread outbreaks of [[waterborne diseases]]. The Chicago Board of Health was organized in 1835 in response to the threat of a [[cholera]] epidemic, and later outbreaks of cholera in 1852 and 1854 killed thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/432.html/ |title=Epidemics |publisher=Encyclopedia of Chicago |date=2004 |website= Encyclopedia of Chicago |access-date=1 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1863, [[Ellis S. Chesbrough]] (1813–1886), the engineer credited with the design of the Chicago sewer system, planned a tunnel five feet wide and lined with brick that would extend through the clay bed of Lake Michigan to a distance of 10,567 feet. Work started in 1864 and the tunnel was opened in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Department of Public Works. Chicago Public Works: A History. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the construction, crews began from the intake location and the shore, tunneling in two shifts a day. Clay and earth were drawn away by mule-drawn railcars. Masons lined the five-foot-diameter tunnel with two layers of brick. The lake and shore crews met in November 1866, less than seven inches out of alignment. A second tunnel was added in 1874.&lt;ref&gt;Chicago Department of Public Works. Chicago Public Works: A History. 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computing with Memory''' refers to computing platforms where function response is stored in memory array, either one or two-dimensional, in the form of [[lookup table]]s (LUTs) and functions are evaluated by retrieving the values from the LUTs. These computing platforms can follow either a purely spatial computing model, as in [[field-programmable gate array]] (FPGA), or a temporal computing model, where a function is evaluated across multiple clock cycles. The latter approach aims at reducing the overhead of programmable interconnect in FPGA by folding interconnect resources inside a computing element. It uses dense two-dimensional memory arrays to store large multiple-input multiple-output LUTs. Computing with Memory differs from Computing in Memory or [[processor-in-memory]] (PIM) concepts, widely investigated in the context of integrating a processor and memory on the same chip to reduce memory latency and increase bandwidth. These architectures seek to reduce the distance the data travels between the processor and the memory. The [[Berkeley IRAM project]] is one notable contribution in the area of PIM architectures.

Computing with memory platforms are typically used to provide the benefit of hardware reconfigurability.  Reconfigurable computing platforms offer advantages in terms of reduced design cost, early time-to-market, rapid prototyping and easily customizable hardware systems. FPGAs present a popular reconfigurable computing platform for implementing digital circuits. They follow a purely spatial computing model. Since their inception in 1985, the basic structure of the FPGAs has continued to consist of two-dimensional array of Configurable Logic blocks (CLBs) and a programmable interconnect matrix.&lt;ref name="Ref 1"&gt;K.Compton and S. Hauck, "Computing: A Survey of systems and software", ''ACM Surveys'', Vol. 34, No. 2, June, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; FPGA performance and power dissipation is largely dominated by the elaborate programmable interconnect (PI) architecture.&lt;ref name="Ref 2"&gt;S. M. Trimberger, ''Field Programmable Gate Array Technology'', Norwell, MA: Kluwer, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 3"&gt;A. Rahman, S. Das, A. P. Chandrakasan, R. Reif, "Wiring Requirement and Three-Dimensional Integration Technology for Field Programmable Gate Arrays", ''IEEE Trans. on Very Large Scale Integration Systems'', Vol. 11, No. 1, February, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective way of reducing the impact of the PI architecture in FPGA is to place small LUTs in close proximity (referred as clusters) and to allow intra-cluster communication using local interconnects. Due to the benefits of a clustered FPGA architecture, major FPGA vendors have incorporated it in their commercial products.&lt;ref name="Ref 4"&gt;[http://www.xilinx.com Xilinx Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 5"&gt;[http://www.altera.com Altera Corporation]&lt;/ref&gt; Investigations have also been made to reduce the overhead due to PI in fine-grained FPGAs by mapping larger multi-input multi-output LUTs to embedded memory blocks. Although it follows a similar spatial computing model, part of the logic functions are implemented using embedded memory blocks while the remaining part is realized using smaller LUTs.&lt;ref name="Ref 6"&gt;J. Cong and S. Xu, "Technology Mapping for FPGAs with Embedded Memory Blocks", Symposium on Field Programmable Gate Array, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a heterogeneous mapping can improve the area and performance by reducing the contribution of programmable interconnects.

Contrary to the purely spatial computing model of FPGA, a reconfigurable computing platform that employs a temporal computing model (or a combination of both temporal and spatial) has also been investigated &lt;ref name="Ref 7"&gt;S. Paul and S. Bhunia, "Reconfigurable Computing Using Content Addressable Memory for Improved Performance and Resource Usage", Design Automation Conference, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref 8"&gt;S. Paul, S. Chatterjee, S. Mukhopadhyay and S. Bhunia, "Nanoscale Reconfigurable Computing Using Non-Volatile 2-D STTRAM Array", International Conference on Nanotechnology, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of improving performance and energy over conventional FPGA. These platforms, referred as Memory Based Computing (MBC), use dense two-dimensional memory array to store the LUTs. Such frameworks rely on breaking a complex function (''f'') into small sub-functions; representing the sub-functions as multi-input, multi-output LUTs in the memory array; and evaluating the function ''f'' over multiple cycles.  MBC can leverage on the high density, low power and high performance advantages of nanoscale memory.&lt;ref name="Ref 8"/&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[:Image:Memory Logic Block.png]]  shows the high-level block diagram of MBC. --&gt;
Each computing element incorporates a two-dimensional memory array for storing LUTs, a small controller for sequencing evaluation of sub-functions and a set of temporary registers to hold the intermediate outputs from individual partitions. A fast, local routing framework inside each computing block generates the address for LUT access. Multiple such computing elements can be spatially connected using FPGA-like programmable interconnect architecture to enable mapping of large functions. The local time-multiplexed execution inside the computing elements can drastically reduce the requirement of programmable interconnects leading to large improvement in energy-delay product and better scalability of performance across technology generations.  The memory array inside each computing element can be realized by [[content-addressable memory]] (CAM) to drastically reduce the memory requirement for certain applications.&lt;ref name="Ref 7"/&gt;

'''Container port design process''' is a set of correlated practices considered during [[container port]] design, aiming to transfer general business mission into detailed design documents for future construction and operation.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pianc.org/edits/articleshop.php?id=2014135|title=PIANC - Technical Report article|last=bvba|first=Consonant|website=www.pianc.org|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The design process involves both conceptual design and detailed design.

== Funding ==

The source of funding determines the mission and scope of the project. Choices include federal funding (subsidies),&lt;ref&gt;Myers, N.; Kent, J. (2001). ''Perverse subsidies: how tax dollars can undercut the environment and the economy''. Washington, DC: Island Press. {{ISBN|1-55963-835-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;, state or local funding, and private funding. 

American ports require subsidies from the federal government in order to keep up with advances in maritime transportation as well as the capabilities of the inland freight movement.  Often, roughly 50% of the costs every year come from federal sources.  The [[American Association of Port Authorities]] (AAPA) is an association which aims at ensuring and increasing federal funds to American ports.

A few federal bills which provide funding for ports are 
* Fixing America's Surface Transportation (FAST) Act: $11 billion in funding to assist in surface transportation improvements
* National Highway Freight Program (NHFP): at least $10 billion in funding reorganized for more efficient use in transportation improvements&lt;ref name="POW Master Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Strategic Master Plan for the Diamond State Port Corporation|url=http://portofwilmington.com/images/DSPC%20Master%20Plan%20-%20FINAL%20-%2007%2029%2016.pdf|website=Port of Wilmington|accessdate=4 December 2016|ref=POW Master Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most often, the State's Department of Transportation (DOT) is the largest state/local financier of public money investments.  The DOTs see the ports as key elements in the systems of movement that they are responsible for such as railways and highways.

Investment from private entities is critical to the creation and execution of port activities.  American ports are often run by private entities in the sense that day-to-day functions are financed and managed with the primary goal of creating revenue.  The municipalities of the terminals are kept up by the Port Authority but the equipment and infrastructure required for operations are under the private entities' power.

With the creation of new ports, often [[Public-Private Partnerships]], otherwise known as 3P, are formed to bring in the upfront capital necessary for someone to take on the financial risk of operating a terminal.  Container terminals are no different in this sense from other types of terminals.

==Cargo ==
[[File:Container sizes.jpeg|thumb|112x112px|Container types in consideration]]

Cargo determines the main function, transportation mode and related characters required for the container port. In container port design, the object cargo is [[intermodal container]]. Containers are usually classified as 20-foot and 40-foot. 53-foot containers were introduced and used both in the U.S.A. and Canada, mainly for domestic road and rail transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://exportlogisticsguide.com/apl-introduces-53-foot-ocean-containers|title=APL Introduces 53 Foot Ocean Containers|date=2013-11-04|access-date=2016-11-30|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104235508/http://exportlogisticsguide.com/apl-introduces-53-foot-ocean-containers|archivedate=2013-11-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{For|container transportation|Intermodal freight transport}}

== Vessels ==
[[File:Container Terminal Tollerort 02.jpg|alt=oversized vessel will not be available to unload cargo.|thumb|Container Vessel in Different size]]

The type of vessel, its dimension and capacity, determines the required capacity for a port's input capacity, which involves berth design, water-borne handling equipment selection and requirements for both storage and land-mode capacity.

The characteristics of vessels and the port characteristics:
* Main dimensions:
** length, which determines the widths and bends of channel, size required for the terminal and maximum number of berths;
** [[Breadth (nautical)|breadth]] and [[air draft]], which influences cargo-handing equipment selection,  and the width of channels;
** [[Hull (watercraft)|draft]], which determines the depth along berths.
* Cargo Capacity, which control over the cargo ship requirements (minimum) of storage, and can affect the loading and unloading processing, usually cranes/ship.
* Designed vessel Function. whether vessel has cargo handling equipment/ how it load cargo. Usually container vessel require external handling equipment.
* Vessel routine shall also get considered as the inter-modal capability requirement for import, export and trans-ship service will be different.

The selection of designed vessel shall also consider the development of the container ship. Underestimating the trend of size development of container ship will result in incapability and low sustainability.

== Location ==
[[File:Triple Bottom Line graphic.jpg|thumb|3BL principle for container port design]]

It should start with data collection and get finished by receiving government permits. The choice of location is considered with philosophy of [[Triple bottom line|triple-bottom line]] and with considerations of waterside access, natural conditions, inter-modal connections and stakeholders.

For ports&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Promotion of the advanced development of urban and regional economy;  
* The requirement of vessel's manoeuvring, [[Brake|braking]], harbor navigation, berthing operations; 
* Greenfield site for general port development, such as new quays, reclamation or [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. 
For container terminals&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* The availability of [[Deep Water Bay|deep water]]; 
* The environmental site conditions including [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] and [[Meteorology|meteorological]] conditions; 
* The availability of land; 
* Good inland transport link or intermodal connections; 
* The [[Soil conditioner|soil conditions]]

=== Waterside Access ===
Waterside access is the condition of waterways in the location, which determines the expected depth, berth quantities, vessel accessibility and effort required for development. Access channel is a waterway that linking the basins of a port to the open sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thomastelford.com|title=Thomas Telford Ltd.|website=www.thomastelford.com|access-date=2016-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of location of access channels is that it determines the [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] factors such as wave, [[tidal cycle]], current, wind met by the ships in the channel. Also, it needs to keep the depth of [[Channel (geography)|channel]] and be able to accommodate the world's largest cargo vessels. For example, in order to meet the need, the [[Port Authority of New York and New Jersey]] runs the Main Navigation Channel Deepening Program, dredged 38 miles of federal channels to as deep as 50 feet by 30 years. There are several aspects, based on PIANC (1997), a designer needs to consider:&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pianc.org|title=PIANC Report N 135-2014|last=bvba|first=Consonant|date=|website=www.pianc.org|publisher=|access-date=2014-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vessel's dimension and velocity; 
# The cargo hazard level; 
# The traffic density; 
# The physical environmental conditions consisting of wind, waves, currents, tidal range, as well as the hardness of the bottom surface.

=== Natural conditions ===
Natural conditions are classified as whether the area selected is developed or natural. Natural condition determines whether there will be existing utilities and constraint for future terminal development.

=== Intermodal connections  ===
Intermodal connection is a place where [[Rail transport|rail]], [[truck]], [[barge]], and other transport methods converge. Intermodal connection for container terminal mainly consists of road and rail. The capacity of [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodal connection]]---docking and the handling, storage and transfer of cargo---determines the capability of terminal cargo transportation to/from the land.

== Stakeholders ==
Stakeholders as any group or individual who can affect or is affected by the achievement of the organization's objectives.(R. Edward Freeman 1984.)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategic Management|last=Freeman|first=R. Edward|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-15174-0|location=UK|pages=292|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stakeholder analysis is a process of systematically gathering and analyzing qualitative information to determine whose interests should be taken into account when developing and or implementing a policy or program. The purpose of a stakeholder analysis is to assess the attitudes of the stakeholders regarding the realization of a new container terminal.

Stakeholder in location selection mainly consist of trade organizations, maritime groups, regional government, neighborhood societies, environment groups and other people with direct/indirect interest related to the terminal. Selection shall involve their participation so as to avoid strong conflicts in future development, and to keep terminal development adapt to the changing demand from these stakeholders.

Agencies and societies involves in this process are:
# [[Port authority|Port Authority]]
# [[Municipality]]
# [[Province]]
# [[Federal government of the United States|National Government]]
# Residents
# Potential Operators
# [[Environmentalist]]

== Permits ==
Permits are crucial in the designing process. Large scale development projects that have the potential for causing significant adverse environmental impacts need permits to start operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polb.com/economics/contractors/forms_permits/development.asp|title=Port of Long Beach - Harbor Development Permit Applications|website=www.polb.com|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects without permits will be identified as offence. Port needs port permits to open. Port Permits are granted automatically from the Guard at the entrance to the Castle/Palace/Doge Estate in the player's capital city once he reaches the required fame needed to obtain it. Environmental permits will be issued by Local Environmental Protection Agencies. Usually include three part: water side, land side and air emissions. Permits for ports should include: clean air permit, construction permit, discharge permit, dredge permits and water discharge permit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www3.epa.gov/|title=US Environmental Protection Agency|last=EPA|first=US|website=www3.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Detailed design==

The consideration of infrastructure includes plans for deployment and construction of infrastructures to implement the functions of terminal. The [[wharf]] at a terminal is the structure which forms the edge of the landside facility.  It is made up of both the topside and the face. The face of the wharf is where equipment is mounted to allow vessels to berth.  It is also designed to be within the high water levels, thus making its structures susceptible to corrosion.  Water-tightness and corrosion protection are a must for any structural elements that make up the face. The topside of the wharf is what is broken down into berths.  Pre-designated lengths of the wharf are separated into identified berths based on the design vessels characteristics.  [[Container crane]]s operate along the wharf when vessels have berthed.

[[Warehouse]]s are created at container terminals to hold specific goods that are transported to the port but are not being shipped out in the same container.  This style of transport is not common, however, this can be service supplied by the terminal owners to increase imports.  Those goods, when warehoused, incur additional handling and storage costs increasing revenue as well.

[[Maintenance management professional|Maintenance]] is the conception that uses engineering theories and practices, risk management and maintenance strategy to plan and implement routine maintenance of facilities and operation systems. The overall maintenance policy for port or terminal should be to maintain all of the facility assets to the extent that the level of expenditure is justified, in order that the assets remain serviceable during their design life or longer and for reasons of safety and security.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A typical maintenance team involves experienced personnel under the control of a qualified engineering maintenance manager and supervisory staff and engineering inspection staff. It should meet requirements listed in ISM ([[International Safety Management Code]]).The maintenance facilities required will include a workshop with sufficient space to work on approximately 10% of the mobile equipment and spreaders at any one time. The maintenance facilities should be located outside but close to the container yard. It is necessary to provide a Stores section within the maintenance facility that will hold necessary spare components and materials. Following are the specific requirements for maintenance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Planned preventive maintenance and statutory inspections of equipment are normally carried out during the day shift when all specialist trades are available. Outside of the day shift minimal manning levels are normally retained to cover breakdowns and emergency repairs only. For other specialist areas such as IT and electronics it is usual to retain specialised personnel due to the specific needs of such systems and equipment. Mechanical and electrical engineering and IT personnel will be responsible for the daily maintenance of cargo handling equipment and other aspects of the facility that require these skills and for specific IT operating systems such as the TOS. High voltage electrical cables and switchgear should be maintained by specialist contractors whilst maintenance of low and medium cables and domestic electrics can be undertaken by electrical tradesmen.

A lay down area is the space where container handling equipment place full or empty containers prior to loading onto the containers' next step in its journey to its destination.  The lay down area is composed of multiple structural layers to support the loads brought on by the equipment and cargo. The first layer, the foundation, consists of either the existing or improved [[subgrade]] of the location.  To add extra strength to the foundation,  the existing soils are compacted further, Soil Improvements such as stone columns are installed, or the unsatisfactory soils are removed and a new fill soil is brought in, graded, and compacted to meet requirements.

The second layer is the asphalt paving.  This pavement differs from typical highway and road pavement as the loads are generally more stationary as well as much smaller in magnitude.  This type of pavement contains Hydraulically Bound Materials (HBM), an ingredient used to provide higher compressive strength to the asphalt.  The mixture is the first part of designing the asphalt with the second being the thickness.  Both the materials and the thickness can be calculated by following existing design guides published by engineering societies.  The [[World Association for Waterborne Transport Infrastructure]]'s (PIANC) Report 165-2015 can provide further guidance on container terminal pavements.&lt;ref name="PIANC Pavements"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Design and Maintenance of Container Terminal Pavements|journal=PIANC|date=2015|volume= Report 165|ref=135-2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lay down area surface is also designed for multiple functions.  The pavement must drain towards a drainage system as well as have a sufficient grip to prevent skidding .  Finally, the pavement is painted to show lanes for travel as well as rows to place [[Intermodal container]] containers when not in transit.

Intermodal yards are mainly consisted of two parts, rail yards and container storage yards. Rail yards should have access to rails and container storage yards should have access to trucks. Container storage yards include yards for inbound containers with cargo and internal movements, yards for outbound containers with cargo, yards for trans-shipment containers and yards for empties. The area requirements are measured in TEU ground slots (the area required for one 20-ft container) plus operating space for equipment that transfers containers to and from the yards and that stack and deliver containers.

== Port security ==
[[Port security]] consists of cargo security, port facility security,staff security and maritime domain security. Port security should be worked jointly by the coast guards and custom and border protection together. Internationally, port security is governed by rules issued by the [[International Maritime Organization]] and its 2002 [[International Ship and Port Facility Security Code]].

During design process, ports need to come up with a port security plan and implement it. The port security plan should include: security survey and risk assessment, physical security and access control, information security, personnel security, maritime terrorism, drug smuggling, stowaways and alien smuggling, roles/ responsibilities/ legal authorities of port agencies, sea robbery, cargo security and hazardous materials and intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ntl.bts.gov/lib/16000/16900/16918/PB2000106164.pdf|title=Port Security- A National Planning Guide|last=U.S. Department of Transportation|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Customs facility ==
Customs should have both base offices at the warehouse and around the gates. The office at the warehouse is mainly for detecting harmful agriculture and smuggling (drugs, dirty money). Office at gates are mainly for the reason of detecting mis-picked cargo or radiation containers. At gates there should be radiation-detection equipments aim at detecting dangerous weapons and radiation stuff that can be used to make dirty bombs. [[Radiation Portal Monitor]]s (RPMs) are passive radiation detection devices used for the screening of individuals, vehicles, cargo or other vectors for detection of illicit sources such as at borders or secure facilities. Portal VACIS imaging system helps trained operators see the contents of closed containers, assisting them in intercepting weapons, contraband, and other items of interest and verifying shipping manifests. Patented drive-through technology lets trucks drive through the system without stopping, providing an effective solution for high-traffic situations where lengthy manual inspection processes are impractical or undesirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.leidos.com/products/security/portal-vacis|title=Portal VACIS|newspaper=Leidos|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mooring ==
[[Mooring (watercraft)]] infrastructure at a port describes those structures that mooring lines from vessels can tie off to in order to prevent drifting along or away from the wharf face.  The mooring structures are called [[cleat (nautical)]] or [[bollards]], depending on their size and shape.  Bollards are designed to handle much larger loads, and in turn, much larger vessels.  Manufacturers of these items typically design the items and supply the finished design to the consultant to include in the bid documents.

Cleats and bollards can be found on all different forms of structures.  The common one is the wharf face of a terminal.  Other locations can include dolphins, which are stand alone structures that are off the face of the landside infrastructure.  Another source can be other barges or sea vessels allowing vessels to tie off to each other.

Bollards and cleats can have multiple types of mooring lines tied off to them.  Bow and stern lines, found at the front and the back of the vessel,  are lines designed to prevent vessels from drifting perpendicular to the berth location.  Breast lines come from closer to the centerline of the vessel and span along the vessel to the mooring location, to keep the vessel from drifting parallel to the berth.  PIANC Report _______  can provide further details on the design of mooring structures.  Bollard and cleat manufacturers can provide more details on dimensions, weights, and capacities of mooring structures&lt;ref name="Maritime International Mooring Catalog"&gt;{{cite web|title=Maritime International Mooring Bollards Catalog|url=http://www.maritimeinternational.com/pdfs/Maritime_International_Bollard_Catalog.pdf|website=Maritime International|ref=Maritime International Mooring Catalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Berthing ==
Berthing of the vessels are analyzed using the design vessels characteristics of weight, draught, and other specification in addition to the requirements set by the terminal location such as wind speeds, direction, currents, and safe berthing velocities of the approach channel and berth.  All these factors come together to determine maximum amounts of energy that must be resisted by the terminal foundation and wharf.  Multiple styles of berthing equipment have been designed in response to this requirement.

Container terminals are for the most part directly on land, eliminating the need for berthing dolphins similar to those described in the Mooring section.  Fender systems installed on the wharf face are the main facility for reducing the amount of energy the wharf structure must absorb during berthing.  A fender system consists of the [[fender (boating)]] itself, the panel, and the various hardware required to anchor and stabilize the unit.

Fenders are made of a grade of rubber chosen for its flexibility.  The more compressible, the more energy the fender can resist.  They come in multiple sizes and shapes, aimed at handling different situations.  Fenders do not need to be mounted in the same location at all times.  Some fenders are designed to rise and fall with water levels.

Panels are large faces that connect to the fender giving more contact space for the vessel.  The size also helps reduce the reaction on the vessel's hull, which is designed for a certain maximum pressure.  They are often covered with a friction reducing surface to prevent lateral forces trying to shear the fender apart.  One final element of panel design is associated not just with its dimensions, but with its location relative to another fender.  The spacing of the fenders relative to the size of the panel must be set so that the design vessel cannot compress the fender in an angled situation and contact the wharf.  Either a second fender panel must be contacted or the fender cannot compress to much in an unsymmetrical fashion.

The structural elements of a fender system must be analyzed ensure equilibrium and stability of each unit at all times.  Chains are installed to keep the panel from putting unnecessary shear due to vessel action or weight of the panel.  Also, anchors are installed into the wharf to anchor the fender to the wharf face.  At these locations, the foundation of the terminal is strengthened more so than at areas of non contact due to the larger forces imparted on the structure.

== Communication ==
Communication is very important in ports because ports are areas with high risks, by good communication people can avoid risks. In the design process, people should consider adding more base stations to ensure good quality of radio contact and video contact. The customs officers should have both radio contact and video contact with truck drivers driving through the gate to make sure they have picked up the right container. Pilots in the port should have good radio communications to guide them sailing. Port labors should have good communication through radio with each other to avoid conflicts and risks.

== Equipment ==
[[File:Melbourne--swanston-dock-container-crane.jpg|thumb|150x150px|waterside container crane in container terminal]]
The consideration of equipment includes plans for procurement and construction of terminal facilities to implement the function of terminal. Equipment involved in detailed design include [[container crane]]s which can be identified by mode: Rail Mounted Quay Crane (RMQC) or Ship to Shore (STS) Crane;   and [[Intermodal container|inter-modal container]] [[Material-handling equipment|transport facilities]] used for storage areas such as [[Reach stacker|Reach Stackers]], Tractor-Trailer Units (TTUs) and Vehicles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Parameters for cranes and inter-modal cargo transport facilities considered in detailed design are: quantities, size limit, power requirement, handling capacity, handling speed, cost, load to land limit, and other working environment constraints.

The deployment of equipment shall be designed with a key mission to create enough cargo transportation to balance the cargo flow. [[Queueing theory]] shall be introduced to the quantity and quality of equipment required.

== Security clearance ==
Because of the characteristics of working at a port, some staff need to have personal security clearance to obtain a job at ports. Like coast guards or customs, because of the ability to have access to classified information. There are three levels of security clearance, confidential, secret and top secret. A critical investigation in it is a background investigation of face-to-face interview with officers. Sometimes staff just need to get interim security clearance. There will also be a periodic reinvestigation every 5 years to obtain a new security clearance. The investigation will again cover key aspects of the individual's life, but will start from one's previous background investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/m/ds/clearances/c10978.htm|title=All About Security Clearances|website=www.state.gov|access-date=2016-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labors ===

[[File:Dockworker lashing a container.jpg|thumb|193x193px|container terminal worker]]
In the ports, operating systems and personnel development are based on skills acquired through experience which is easily undertaken in advanced industrial environments.

Several agreements we should take them into account:
* ILO code of practice --- Safety and Health in ports; (2003)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Safety and health in ports|last=ILO|first=ILO|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2003|isbn=92-2-115287-1|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ILO code of practice --- Security in ports; (2004)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Security in ports|last=ILO|first=ILO|publisher=International Labour Organization|year=2004|isbn=92-2-115286-3|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ILO Maritime Labour Convention (2006)

=== Safety and security ===

''Safety is the condition of a "steady state" of an organization or place . ''Security is the process or means, physical or human, of delaying, preventing, and otherwise protecting against external or internal, defects, dangers, loss, criminals, and other individuals or actions. The main documents related to terminal operations are the [[International Labour Organization|ILO convention]] 152 (1979) and the ILO code of practice (2003) which cope with health and safety of port labor.

=== Logistics ===

[[File:Schematic container-transport chain.png|thumb|Schematic container-transport chain.png]]
Logistics is the general [[supply chain]] of how resources are acquired, stored and transported to their final destination. It involves identifying prospective distributors and [[suppliers]], and determining their effectiveness and accessibility.

=== Customs ===

Customs and Border Protection exists to safeguard country's borders thereby protecting the public from dangerous people and materials while enhancing the nation's global economic competitiveness by enabling legitimate trade and travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/about|title=About CBP {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customs at ports of entry has two main tasks: cargo security and protecting agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/border-security/ports-entry|title=At Ports of Entry {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every port should have their own nation's customs. They should have base offices both at the administration building and the warehouse (check agriculture) and outside offices at both the entry gates leaving gates. Groups of customs at port should be consisted of Marine Interdiction Agents, Border Patrol Agents, Agriculture Specialists, Custom and Border Protection Officers and Import Specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbp.gov/careers/join-cbp|title=Join CBP {{!}} U.S. Customs and Border Protection|website=www.cbp.gov|access-date=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dictionary of Art Historians''' (DAH) is an [[Internet encyclopedia project|online encyclopedia]] of topics relating to [[art historian]]s, [[art critic]]s and their dictionaries.  The mission of the project is to provide free, reliable, English-language information on published art historians.

The DAH was started in 1986 as a notecard project indexing art historians by the editors Lee R. Sorensen and Monique Daniels.&lt;ref name=DAH&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/about Mission statement and history of the DAH]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002 the project was migrated to the internet and in 2010 the project was adopted by the art history department of [[Duke University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.wlu.edu/details.php?resID=604 Entry for the DAH] on library website of Washington and Lee university&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the project was adopted by the [http://www.dukewired.org/ Wired!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1626">'''EIAJ MTS''' is a multichannel television sound standard created by the [[EIAJ]].

Bilingual and stereo sound television programs started being broadcast in Japan in October 1978 using a system developed by [[NHK Science &amp; Technology Research Laboratories|NHK Technical Research Labs]]. This system was modified and standardized by the EIAJ in January 1979. 

The original version M TV standard has a monaural FM transmission at 4.5&amp;nbsp;MHz. For Japanese multichannel television sound a second channel, or sub-channel, is added to the original signal by using an FM sub-carrier at twice the line frequency (Fh, or 15374&amp;nbsp;Hz). In order to identify the different modes (mono, stereo, or dual sound) a [[pilot tone]] is also added on an AM carrier at 3.5 times the line frequency. The pilot tone frequencies are 982.5&amp;nbsp;Hz for stereo and 922.5&amp;nbsp;Hz for dual sound. Contrary to [[Zweikanalton]] these pilot tones are not coupled to the line frequency but were instead chosen to allow use of filters already employed in the Pocket Bell [[pager]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Numaguchi|first=Yasutaka|title=Present Status of Multichannel-Sound Television Broadcasting in Japan|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|date=December 1979|volume=BC-25|issue=4|pages=128–136|doi=10.1109/TBC.1979.266340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Earth &amp; Sky''''', also known as '''''EarthSky''''' (the still-active website), was a daily radio series that presented information about [[science]] and [[nature]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.EarthSky.org EarthSky.]'' [http://earthsky.org/earthsky-a-clear-voice-for-science Earthsky: A clear voice for science] Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It began broadcasting in 1991. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was the creation of producers [[Deborah Byrd]] and Joel Block, who were also the hosts.  They previously hosted the program [[StarDate (radio program)|Star Date]] that began broadcasting in the US in 1977.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' presented 60- and 90-second radio spots (called "modules") on a wide variety of scientific topics, communicating through terrestrial [[radio]] as well as [[satellite radio]] and [[internet radio]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.Podfeed.net Podfeed.net].''  http://www.podfeed.net/podcast/Earth++Sky+radio+show/2730  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was aired one or more times daily on more than 1,000 [[commercial broadcasting|commercial]], [[National Public Radio|NPR]], and other [[public radio]] stations, 80 affiliate stations for the sight-impaired, and across 35 channels on both [[XM Satellite Radio|XM]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] satellite radio in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.EarthSky.org ''EarthSky''.] http://earthsky.org/partners/offerings  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Abroad, the programming iwas heard on American Forces Radio, [[Voice of America]] Radio, [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]], and others.

The information on ''Earth &amp; Sky'' came directly from scientists. The [[journalist]]s who produced the ''Earth &amp; Sky'' radio program and continue to produce the Website speak to several scientists each day, dozens each week and hundreds each year.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky  Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt; More than 500 scientists had joined ''Earth &amp; Sky'' as volunteer advisers. ''Earth &amp; Sky'' science advisers suggested content, gave feedback, recommended other experts, and reviewed scripts for accuracy before they were recorded for broadcast.

''Earth &amp; Sky'' featured many fields of science. In 2006, it focused was on [[nanotechnology]], [[women in science]], [[List of Earth observation satellites|observing the Earth]], [[astrophysics]] and [[Space science|space]], and the human world.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.turkcebilgi.com/Earth+%26+Sky Retrieved 1 Dec 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The final episode of ''Earth &amp; Sky'' was broadcast on June 2, 2013. President and co-founder Deborah Byrd said that although funding options existed to continue the radio program, a decision was made to stop producing the radio show in order to concentrate on the Website and social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Watson|first1=Brandon|title=Silent Nignt: EarthSky says goodbye to radio|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/daily/news/2013-03-04/silent-night/|accessdate=16 July 2014|work=The Austin Chronicle|date=March 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Mizrach}}
The '''Eastern Wall''' is an ancient structure in [[Jerusalem]] that is both part of the eastern side of the city [[Walls of Jerusalem|wall of Jerusalem]] and the eastern wall of the ancient [[Temple Mount]].

The Eastern Wall is the oldest of the four visible walls of the Temple Mount; the Northern, [[Western Wall|Western]] and [[Southern Wall]]s date from the period of [[Herod the Great]], who expanded the area of the Temple Mount to the north, west and south.  Older walls on these sides are presumed to survive underground.  The Eastern Wall now visible was built in at least four stages, during the reign of [[Hezekiah]], during the time of [[Zerubbabel]], in the [[Hasmonean]] period and in the [[Herodian]] period.  Repairs and major renovations were made in later periods.  Major renovations to the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] were made in the [[Umayyad]] period.

==History of construction==

===First Temple period===

Architectural archaeologist [[Leen Ritmeyer]] identifies specific courses of visible [[ashlars]] located on to the northern and south of the [[Golden Gate (Jerusalem)|Golden Gate]] as Judean Iron Age in style, dating them to the construction of this wall by [[King Hezekiah]].  More such stones are supposed to survive underground.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  According to [[Hershel Shanks]], "most scholars," think that Ritmeyer is "correct."&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;

Ritmeyer has pointed out that the [[Dome of the Rock]] is seated on a square platform atop the Temple Mount, the sides of which, defined by short flights of steps, are square and parallel to the modern walls of the Mount with one exception: the western steps deviate from parallel.  Moreover, the bottom step on the western side of the Dome of the Rock platform is composed of a single line of distinctively large and "beautifully polished" ashlars.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jerusalem, an Archaeological Biography|first=Hershel|last=Shanks|publisher=Random House|year=1995|pages=47–65|isbn=978-0-679-44526-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Ritmeyer, the measurements given in the [[Mishna]], tractate Middot, "The Temple Mount measured 500 cubits by 500 cubits," can be traced on the modern Temple Mount, with this step the outline of the western side of the square and the Eastern Wall the eastern side.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;  The "precise" measurement of an ancient Judean royal [[cubit]], 20.67 inches, outlines these landmarks area exactly.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt; The northern edge of the ancient square was demarcated by [[Charles Warren]], the last archaeologist permitted by the local [[waqf]] to explore the underground areas of the Mount, in his{{clarify |date=July 2017 |reason=word(s) missing?}} the underground structure he labeled as No. 29 in surveys he carried out in the 1860s.  The southern side of the 500 cubit ancient platform square is marked by he the so-called "Straight Joint," a visible bend in the eastern wall.&lt;ref name=ShanksHouse/&gt;&lt;ref name=RitmeyerOriginal&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, “Locating the Original Temple Mount,” BAR, March/April 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ritmeyer proposes that this 500 cubit walled square was constructed by King Hezekiah c. 700 BCE to expand the flat area in which the faithful could gather at the Solomonic-era Temple.  The [[Foundation Stone]] around which is the ancient Jewish Temple was built and which is now sheltered under the Dome of the Rock, is a natural rock outcrop at the highest point of a [[Mount Moriah]]; the natural contour of the land fell away steeply on all sides, although on the eastern side the natural contour formed a flat plateau before falling sharply to the [[Kidron Valley]] along the line where the Eastern Wall stands.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount&gt;Leen Ritmeyer, Kathleen Ritmeyer, ''Jerusalem; The Temple Mount,'' Carta, Jerusalem, 2015, {{ISBN|9789652208552}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The "Straight Joint" where the wall bends very slightly, demarcating the line between the Hezekiahan wall and the Hasmonean extension, is marked by a round column protruding from the wall near the top.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Hasmonean expansion===

The [[Hasmonean dynasty]] expanded the 500 cubit Temple platform toward the south; distinctively Hasmonean ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt; The seam between the Hasmonean and Herodian extensions of the wall is visible as a vertical row of ashlars 32 meters north of the southeast corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

===Herodian expansion===
King Herod expanded the Temple Mount still further toward the south; distinctively Herodian ashlars are visible in the Eastern Wall, in the last  stretch before the southeastern corner.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Gates in the Eastern Wall==
[[File:Golden Gate Jerusalem 2009.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Golden Gate]]
{{main article|Golden Gate (Jerusalem)}}
The magnificent Muslim period Golden Gate (sealed) replaced the ancient Golden Gate. The present gate is understood to have been constructed during the [[Umayyad]] period atop the ancient footings.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

==Muslim cemetery==

There is a Muslim cemetery along the southern stretch of the Eastern Wall. A path through the cemetery and parallel to the wall lies atop the ancient city wall, explored by Charles Warren in excavations since covered over, which once lay just outside the Eastern Wall of the Temple Mount.&lt;ref name=RitmeyerMount/&gt;

[[File:Glacier-Lyman-Tamarack.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The North Cascades are high and rugged with varied conifer species.]]

The '''Ecology of the North Cascades''' is heavily influenced by the high elevation and [[rain shadow]] effects of the mountain range. The North Cascades is a section of the [[Cascade Range]] from the South Fork of the [[Snoqualmie River]] in [[Washington (state)|Washington]], United States, to the confluence of the [[Thompson River|Thompson]] and [[Fraser River]]s in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], where the range is officially called the Cascade Mountains but is usually referred to as the Canadian Cascades. The '''North Cascades Ecoregion''' is a Level III [[List of ecoregions in North America (CEC)|ecoregion]] in the [[Commission for Environmental Cooperation]]'s classification system.&lt;ref name="cec"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/cec_na/NA_LEVEL_III.pdf|title=Ecological Regions of North America, Level I-III|publisher=Commission for Environmental Cooperation|accessdate=2009-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrain of the North Cascades is composed of high, rugged mountains. It contains the greatest concentration of active alpine [[glacier]]s in the [[conterminous United States]] and has a variety of climatic zones. A [[Semi-arid climate|dry continental climate]] occurs in the east and mild, [[maritime climate|maritime]], [[rainforest]] conditions are found in the west. It is underlain by [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] and [[metamorphic rock]] in contrast to the adjoining Cascades which are composed of volcanics.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.epa.gov/wed/ecoregions/us/Eco_Level_III_US.pdf|title=Level III ecoregions|work=Western Ecology Division|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2009-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The North Cascades has a diversity of plant and animal species.&lt;ref name=gorp&gt;{{cite web|title=North Cascades National Park: Wildlife|work=GORP|publisher=Orbitz|first=Karen|last=Kefauver|date=15 Sep 2010|accessdate=6 June 2012|url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-north-cascades-national-park-wildlife-sidwcmdev_067731.html|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68F9qAOsg?url=http://www.gorp.com/parks-guide/travel-ta-north-cascades-national-park-wildlife-sidwcmdev_067731.html|archivedate=2012-06-07|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains more than 1630 [[vascular plant]] species.&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite web|title=Plants|work=North Cascades National Park|publisher=National Park Service|date=16 May 2012|accessdate=6 June 2012|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/plants.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The range has a number of top predators, including [[bald eagle]]s, [[grey wolf|wolves]], [[grizzly bear]]s, [[mountain lion]]s and [[American black bear|black bear]]s.&lt;ref name=gorp/&gt; The range is home to at least 75 species of mammals and 200 species of birds that either pass through or use the North Cascades for a breeding area. There are also 11 species of fish on the west side of the Cascades.&lt;ref name=gorp/&gt; Examples of amphibian species occurring in the North Cascades include the [[western toad]] (''Bufo boreas'') and the [[rough-skinned newt]] (''Taricha granulosa'').&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite web |first1=Ashley K. |last1=Rawhouser |first2=Ronald E. |last2=Holmes |first3=Reed S. |last3=Glesne |year=2009 |url=http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/nccn/reports/inventory/NCCN_NOCA_Stream_Amphibian_Inventory_2005_20090215.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68FATDIU5?url=http://science.nature.nps.gov/im/units/nccn/reports/inventory/NCCN_NOCA_Stream_Amphibian_Inventory_2005_20090215.pdf |archivedate=2012-06-07 |title=A Survey of Stream Amphibian Species Composition and Distribution in the North Cascades National Park Service Complex, Washington State |accessdate=2012-06-07 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecology of the area can be understood by following a west-to-east line at the southern end of the North Cascades, at approximately 47.5 degrees north. As the line passes through the Cascade range, it passes through a number of ecoregions, first getting higher and colder, then getting warmer, yet drier. Each of these component ecoregions can be described by either a tree [[indicator species]], or by a lack of trees: [[western hemlock]], [[Pacific silver fir]], subalpine [[mountain hemlock]], [[Alpine tundra|alpine]], [[Abies lasiocarpa|subalpine fir]], and [[grand fir]]/[[Douglas fir]].&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;

==Western Hemlock Ecoregion==
[[File:Coal Creek Falls 04048.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Coal Creek Falls and surrounding thick vegetation in the [[Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park]].]]
The Western Hemlock Ecoregion huddles in the lower west-side elevations of the North Cascades.  Western hemlock is found from sea level up to {{convert|2500|ft|m|-2}} in elevation.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; In the Alpine Lakes Wilderness this ecoregion can be found in the lower elevations around {{convert|1000|to|2000|ft|m|-2}}&lt;ref name="alwplan"&gt;{{cite report|title=Alpine Lakes Area Land Management Plan|date=1981|publisher=USDA Forest Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average annual temperature is {{convert|47|F|C}} and it gets between {{convert|70|to|300|cm|in|-1}} in precipitation per year.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kruckeberg|first=Arthur|title=The Natural History of Puget Sound Country|publisher=University of Washington Press|year=1991|isbn=0-295-97477-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ecoregion is evidenced by the dense stands of [[western hemlock]], [[Douglas fir]], [[western red cedar]] and [[red alder]].&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt; The understory is primarily composed of [[salal]], [[hazel]], [[salmonberry]], [[devil's club]] and [[Oregon grape]].&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt; The western hemlock (''Tsuga heterophylla'') is an extremely shade tolerant tree and it is common to find its seedlings and saplings in the understories of the forest floors.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; It prefers moist temperate conditions.  As conditions get drier and colder they don’t fare as well.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Western hemlocks can reach over {{convert|200|ft|m|-1}} in height with a diameter of {{convert|3|to|4|ft|m|1}}.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; They can be identified by their drooping leader at the top of the tree.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; It is not uncommon to find western hemlocks growing in a row on a nurse log.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; The Western Hemlock Ecoregion offers an abundance of life.   [[Black-tailed deer]] graze in their understories.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Fox, coyotes, cougars, and an assortment of herbivore mammals and birds can also be found in these low elevation forests.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;

==Silver Fir Ecoregion==
[[File:Waterfall 6966.JPG|thumb|left|Lake Twenty-two cirque headwall at {{convert|2400|ft|m}}.]]
The mid-elevation forests in the North Cascades with an elevation between {{convert|2000|to|4300|ft|m|-2}} is the Silver Fir Ecoregion.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; The Silver Fir Ecoregion makes up for much of the valleys in the Alpine Lakes area. The average annual temperature in this ecoregion is {{convert|42|F|C}} and the average precipitation in centimeters is between {{convert|220|-|280|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; Typical montane forests in this ecoregion is dominated by [[Pacific silver fir]] and also contains [[noble fir]], [[Douglas fir]], and [[Alaska yellow-cedar]].&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; [[Coarse woody debris]] is very characteristic of the Silver Fir Ecoregion, providing microsites for organisms.  The Pacific silver fir zone is in some of the steepest parts of the topography and heavy snow often leads to avalanche gullies.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; In every major drainage basin along the western slopes of the Cascade Mountains there is evidence of avalanche tracks breaking up the forested vegetation with nonforested vegetation.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; These gullies provide sites of new successional growth as they move toward a coniferous forest again.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Because of the dense forests of the Silver Fir Ecoregion, it was the preferred area for commercial logging prior to designation of areas as wilderness. 
     
The Pacific silver fir (''Abies amabilis'') is extremely tolerant of shade and does not fare as well in drought or warmer temperatures.&lt;ref name="pacSilverFir"&gt;{{cite web |title=Pacific Silver Fir |publisher=Washington Department of Natural Resources |url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/lm_ess_wog_pacific_silver_fir.pdf |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5yRZGQ9Nk?url=http://www.dnr.wa.gov/Publications/lm_ess_wog_pacific_silver_fir.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-05 |accessdate=March 11, 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can grow as high as {{convert|180|ft|m}} and reach {{convert|3|–|5|ft|m|1}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; The understory communities of the Pacific silver fir can vary depending on moisture availability.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Common understory shrubs include the [[vine maple]], [[salal]], Cascade [[Oregon grape]], [[blueberry]], mountain [[huckleberry]], [[devil's club]], and [[Menziesia|fool's huckleberry]].&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Common understory herbs are [[bear grass]], [[twin flower]], [[pipsissewa]], dwarf dogwood or [[Cornus canadensis|bunchberry]], bead lily, [[Rubus ursinus|trailing blackberry]], [[Maianthemum stellatum|low false Solomon’s seal]], [[foam flower]], [[trillium]], [[Gymnocarpium dryopteris|oak fern]], and [[lady fern]].&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; The microclimate of the understory is moderated by the forest canopy causing the conditions to be cooler and moister in the summer and warmer in the winter.&lt;ref name="pacSilverFir" /&gt; Pacific silver fir seedlings and saplings are often found growing under their own canopies or those of a mixed canopy forest.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Along streams in this ecoregion, breaks in the forest are replaced by [[grey alder|mountain alder]], [[willow]] and [[vine maple]] and herbs such as [[saxifrage]], [[Epilobium|yellow willow-herb]], [[monkey flower]]s, and [[Mertensia|bluebell]]s can be found.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Mountain alder and vine maple can also be found around lake edges and in areas of flat or gentle slopes, bogs, or marsh habitat.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Examples of Pacific silver fir forests can be found in the Commonwealth Basin and the Snow Lake areas of the Alpine Lakes Wilderness.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;

==Subalpine Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion==
[[File:Rachel Lake 26444.JPG|thumb|right|Mountain hemlock and subalpine fir forest around Rachel Lake (elev. {{convert|4640|ft|m}}).]]
Moving up in elevation from the Silver Fir Ecoregion, between about {{convert|4000|to|5400|ft|m|-2}} on the west side of the Cascade Range, the ecoregion shifts to the Subalpine Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;  This ecoregion has a colder annual average temperature of {{convert|39|F|C}} with average annual precipitation between {{convert|160|to|280|cm|in|-1}}.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; This ecoregion consists of [[mountain hemlock]] forests, [[subalpine meadow]]s, streams, lakes, wetlands and avalanche gullies creating distinct patterns of new succession.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; In the lower ends of this ecoregion there are continuous closed canopy forests while the higher reaches will see mosaics of meadows with patches of mountain hemlock forests.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; The mountain hemlock forests consist of mountain hemlock, [[subalpine fir]], [[Alaska yellow-cedar]], and [[Pacific silver fir]].&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; Washington’s alpine and subalpine areas account for about 4.4% of its total land area.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|first=D.H.|last=Johnson|first2=T.A.|last2=O’Neil|title=Wildlife Habitat Relationships Washington and Oregon|year=2001|publisher=Oregon State University Press|location=Oregon|isbn=0-87071-488-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
     
Progressing upward from the gradient of Silver Fir and Mountain Hemlock ecoregions, the mountain hemlock (''Tsuga mertensiana'') tends to become the dominant conifer, although it may codominate with the Alaska cedar and Pacific silver fir.  Mountain hemlock trees live as long as 1000 years: longer than the Pacific silver fir. Trees between 500–700 years may be {{convert|100|to|125|ft|m|-1}} tall.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Hemlock cones are about {{convert|2|-|3|in|cm|0}} in length and develop at the ends of branches.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; These conifers are easy to distinguish amongst the others with their dense grayish-green needles.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; According to Franklin and Dyrness, the understory where the mountain hemlock and Pacific silver fir co-dominate is dominated by tall mountain [[huckleberry]]; where the Alaska cedar dominates, the understory is dominated by dense collage of [[rhododendron]], huckleberry and [[Sorbus|mountain ash]].&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;

In the higher boundaries of subalpine ecosystem, where the abiotic conditions are more stressful, trees are clumped together in patchy islands. Trees in this area can be recognized by its [[krummholz]] form.  Trees of this upper boundary will take on a flag appearance with branches extending from one side indicating the prevailing wind directions.  The skirt height of the trees is indicative of the height of snow cover where branches tend not to grow.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; There are various reasons as to why these trees take this form.  Strong winds combined with ice particles will cause abrasion scouring the waxy cuticle from one side of the tree creating damage that will prevent branch formation and growth.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; In addition, the wind will cause desiccation and evaporation in the needles causing branches to die on this side of the trees.  
[[File:Penstemon davidsonii 9224.JPG|thumb|left|upright|''[[Penstemon|Penstemon davidsonii]]'' in [[Mount Pilchuck State Park]] at {{convert|5300|ft|m}}.]]
  
Scattered amongst the island patches of trees in the upper boundaries are parkland areas with showy meadows.  Events such as fire, avalanches, snow slumping and climate change make the boundaries of these areas and the balance of trees and meadows dynamic.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; The forest islands typically consist of mountain hemlock, [[subalpine fir]], and Alaska cedar.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Often there are invasions of trees into meadow areas and this reached a peak in the 1930s due to considerable warming.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Invasions of meadows by trees can also occur with disturbances.

The beauty of meadows is very popular amongst hikers.  Wildflowers that are found in this ecoregion are the [[Lilium columbianum|tiger lily]], [[glacier lily]], bead lily, queen's cup, [[Aquilegia|columbine]], [[Astereae|aster]], [[trillium]], [[pearly everlasting]], [[Valerian (herb)|valerian]], [[Ipomopsis aggregata|skyrocket]], [[Dodecatheon|shooting star]], [[penstemon]], [[lousewort]], [[Gentiana calycosa|mountain bog gentian]], [[monkey flower]], [[monkshood]], [[bluebell (disambiguation)|bluebell]], [[Campanula|bellflower]], [[Dicentra|bleeding heart]], [[Tweedy's lewisia]], [[balsamroot]], wild [[orchid]]s and more.&lt;ref name="smoot"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smoot|first=Jeff|title=Backpacking Washington’s Alpine Lakes Wilderness|year=2004|publisher=The Globe Pequot Press|location=Helena, Montana|isbn=0-7627-3098-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wildflowers are at their peak in the meadows and along streams from mid-July to mid-August.&lt;ref name="smoot" /&gt; The parklands of the Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion draw their distinct characteristics from the climate and topography.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;

The two dominant vegetation types of this mountain region, forests and meadows, have very distinct differences in their [[microclimate]]s.  The amount of solar radiation and UV exposure can vary substantially in our northern latitude largely based on the time of day, slope, season, cloud cover and vegetation.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Temperatures adjust accordingly to this solar radiation and exposure.  The parklands of this montane region have a much larger range of temperatures as compared to the hemlock forests.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; The range can be as much as {{convert|50|F-change|C-change}} while the range in the forests rarely exceeds {{convert|20|F-change|C-change}}.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; This is due to the canopy of the trees, creating a much more protected environment as compared to the open meadows.  In addition soil temperatures directly impact biological activity affecting soil organisms and root systems.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Daily and season temperature changes greatly affect the soils' heat loss and gain.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; However, the snowpack acts as an insulating buffer against temperature change in soils.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; The mountain hemlock forests are the wettest and coldest of the Cascade forest zones.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt;
    
In the richness of this region many animal species pass through this zone at least one season a year such as [[mountain goat]], [[black-tailed deer]], [[American black bear]], [[elk]], [[cougar]], and many bird species.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Only the whistling [[hoary marmot]] is restricted to alpine and subalpine areas.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Besides the richness of mammals there is a richness of insects that are integral to the abundance of flowering plant species in this area.&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; Another important pollinator in this area is the [[hummingbird]].&lt;ref name="Kruckeberg" /&gt; There is still much to be researched and discovered to better understand species interactions and reliance in both the alpine and subalpine ecosystems.

==Alpine Ecoregion==
[[File:Mount Daniel 27801.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mount Daniel]], looking up from {{convert|6100|ft|m|-2}}.]]
The Alpine Ecoregion makes up much of the North Cascades.   Alpine areas such as this are rugged with rocky ridges, [[snowfield]]s, partially vegetated terrain, and are above the natural [[treeline]].&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; The timberline in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness is found at approximately {{convert|6000|ft|m|-2}}.&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt;  The average annual temperature is {{convert|37.5|F|C|0}} with only a mean annual precipitation of {{convert|46|cm|in}}.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; These conditions along with winds and blowing ice are not conducive for trees. Because of the extreme temperatures and low precipitation there are few plant species as compared to lower elevation ecosystems and they are simpler in structure.&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt; However, precipitation, or lack thereof, is a more important limiting factor than temperature.&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt; Both plant and animal species have adapted in many different ways to deal with this challenging environment.  
       
This high elevation habitat of high winds, prolonged snow cover, steep terrain, high temperature variability, and intense UV radiation lead to special species [[adaptation]]s.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Alpine regions generally have hypoxic conditions that lead to additional energy expenses for organisms.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Increased elevations usually lead to shorter breeding season in animals, as is the case in the alpine ecosystems in the North Cascades.  In addition to the shorter breeding season, wildlife often requires seasonal movement to different elevations in order to find adequate food and habitat.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; However, species such as the [[white-tailed ptarmigan]], [[hoary marmot]]s, and [[pika]]s remain in high elevations of the Cascades year round left only to go to patchy and scattered alpine vegetation.  The majority of species will move to lower elevations at some time throughout their life history.  Adaptations such as torpor in hummingbirds, the ability of mountain goats and coyotes to camouflage in the landscape, animals developing extra fat deposits, and the raptor's ability to move efficiently in the strong winds illustrate just some of the ways species have been ability to cope with alpine conditions.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; The white-tailed ptarmigan has an adaption of changing its plumage from  white in the winter to brown in the summer in order to camouflage.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Many species in higher elevations produce fewer offspring than in lower elevations but spend more time nurturing their young.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;
[[File:Lagopus leucurus 7191.JPG|thumb|left|A white-tailed ptarmigan blends into the alpine tundra east of [[Glacier Peak]].]]
     
While alpine ecosystems provide challenging abiotic conditions for species there are advantages to animal species to habituate these areas.  In the winter while there is extensive snow pack there are also strong winds that will expose herbaceous stems and seeds for animals to forage on.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Insects that are blown up from lower elevations will land on the snow beds in the spring offering much nutrition for birds and other mammals that breed in the alpine.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; When snowfields melt it creates a gradient of plant [[phenology]] which provides emerging vegetation over a period of time for herbivores to feed on and migrate along this line.  Spring foraging is believed to be crucial in the breeding in a number of species such as the mountain goat.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Leaf budding and fruiting  in late summer past the edges of snowfields also offer food for the animals that depend  on this area.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; [[American black bear|Black bear]]s, songbirds and marmots in the North Cascades and Alpine Lakes can find cover in lush vegetation in avalanche chutes adjacent to the subalpine forests.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; There seems to also be evidence that there is a lower rate of parasitism and disease in these  high alpine elevations offering yet another advantage to alpine species.  The alpine [[grouse]] is one example of an alpine animal that has few blood infections or intestinal parasites.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt; Other animal species in the summer months will migrate into the higher alpine elevations to avoid insects and forage in the meadows.&lt;ref name="Johnson" /&gt;

==Subalpine Fir Ecoregion==
[[File:SubalpineLarch 7717l.jpg|thumb|right|Patchy forest of subalpine fir, mountain hemlock, and subalpine larch at {{convert|6200|ft|m|-2}} in the [[Wenatchee Mountains]].]]
The Subalpine Fir Ecoregion, descending down the east-side of the Cascade Range, reaches elevations between {{convert|4200|-|6000|ft|m|-2}}.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; This area has the same mean annual temperature of {{convert|39|F|C}} as the Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion, but a drastically lower annual average precipitation of between {{convert|100|-|150|cm|in|-1}} with a much larger portion falling as snow rather than as rain.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; The ecosystems in this ecoregion are the [[subalpine fir]] forests, [[subalpine meadow]]s, avalanche gullies, and freshwater wetlands, streams and lakes.&lt;ref name="wgold"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/wgold/bis358/012808.pdf|last=Gold|first=W.|title=BIS258 lecture notes|publisher=University of Washington|date=2008-01-28|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
       
The subalpine fir forests in the North Cascades include [[Douglas fir]], [[Engelmann spruce]], [[subalpine larch]], and [[whitebark pine]].&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; The Engelmann spruce and the subalpine fir are commonly found together.  In the higher boundaries of this ecoregion the subalpine fir takes on the [[krummholz]] form. The Subalpine Fir Ecoregion is characterized by its patches of forest and meadows in its upper range similarly to the Mountain Hemlock Ecoregion.&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt;

==Grand Fir/Douglas Fir Ecoregion==
{{see also|Cascade Mountains leeward forests}}
[[File:Pseudotsuga menziesii 7971.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Douglas fir at {{convert|4965|ft|m}} in the [[Wenatchee Mountains]].]]
Descending down the east side of the Cascade Range is the [[Grand Fir]]/[[Douglas Fir]] Ecoregion with a very diverse forest.  This forest has the most diverse trees of the forested ecoregions in Washington state which includes grand fir, Douglas fir, [[Engelmann spruce]], [[subalpine fir]], [[ponderosa pine]], [[lodgepole pine]], [[western white pine]], [[whitebark pine]], [[western larch]], and [[subalpine larch]]. This ecoregion has an annual mean temperature of {{convert|46|F|C}} and receives between {{convert|60|-|110|cm|in}} of precipitation per year.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt; The elevation range of this ecoregion is between {{convert|2000|-|5000|ft|m|-2}}.&lt;ref name="wgold" /&gt;
     
In the upper regions of this ecoregion, the dominant conifers are the mountain hemlock and subalpine fir and in the lower boundary the [[grand fir]] and Douglas fir dominate.&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt; There is a variety of  understory vegetation in this ecoregion that includes [[pinegrass]], [[Carex geyeri|elk sedge]], [[Cyperaceae|sedges]], low shrubs, [[vine maple]], [[Alnus rhombifolia|white alder]], and [[huckleberry]].&lt;ref name="alwplan" /&gt; This diverse landscape offers habitat to many species including grazers such as [[deer]], [[elk]], [[American black bear|black bear]], herbivores, and a variety of birds.

==Fauna==
A variety of [[reptile]]s, [[amphibian]]s, [[mammal]]s, birds and [[arthropod]]s are found in the North Cascades. A small number of [[grizzly bear]]s (''Ursus arctos horribilis'') inhabit the far northern Cascades, near the [[Canada–United States border]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bearinfo.org/gbusa.htm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080108072618/http://www.bearinfo.org/gbusa.htm | archivedate=2008-01-08 | title=Grizzly Bears In the USA and the North Cascades: Past and Present | publisher=Grizzly Bear Outreach Project | accessdate=2009-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A breeding pack of [[gray wolf|wolves]] was confirmed in [[Okanogan County, Washington|Okanogan County]] in 2008, the first such pack in Washington state since the 1930s.&lt;ref name=wdfw/&gt; Other predator species include [[mountain lion]]s, [[American black bear|black bear]]s,&lt;ref name=gorp/&gt; [[fisher (animal)|fisher]]s, and [[wolverine]]s.&lt;ref name=NPSanimals&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals|url=http://www.nps.gov/noca/naturescience/animals.htm|work=North Cascades National Park|publisher=National Park Service|accessdate=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Effective safety training''' is an unofficial phrase used to describe the training materials designed to teach [[occupational safety and health]] standards developed by the United States government labor organization, [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA). OSHA has produced many standards and regulations that affect employers and employees in the United States.  United States employers have a legal responsibility to educate employees on all [[Occupational safety and health|workplace safety]] standards and the hazards that their employees may face while on the job, and providing effective safety training meets that responsibility.

==Introduction==

Employers must have an overall safety program including relative site specific safety information where applicable.   The safety training program should cover topics such as:&lt;ref name="Barnett"&gt;Lawrence(J.D.), Barnett (2000). ''Safety Management Handbook: CCH Safety Professional Series''. Vol. 2 pg.9301–9307. Health and Human Resources, Chicago, IL&lt;/ref&gt;
*accident prevention and safety promotion
*safety compliance
*accident and emergency response
*personal protective equipment
*safety practices
*equipment and machinery
*chemical and hazardous materials safety
*workplace hazards
*employee involvement

Employers must document all training.  Creating a training matrix will help keep track of who has been trained, when they were trained, the training topic, and when it is time for refresher training. Employees must also sign an official sign-in sheet provided by the employer that can serve as proof that employees received proper training.  The sign in sheet must have a broad description of what is being covered in the training. Tests or quizzes on the presented material can help gauge employee understanding of the material and highlight topics that need to be reviewed.

The non-English speaking population is consistently growing in many industries and it is important that employers provide bilingual training for those workers, as OSHA requires that '''all employees''' be properly trained.

Most employees display attitudes of disinterest and dread at the thought of attending a safety training, which can leave the trainer feeling frustrated and unappreciated.  It is the trainer's duty to make safety training fun and educational, which will help the trainees to retain the information, enjoy the course, and apply the learning to their work and lives.&lt;ref&gt;Hilyer, Barbara; Veasey, Alan; Oldfield, Kenneth; Craft-McCormick, Lisa (2000) ''Effective Safety and Health Training'', CRC Press {{ISBN|1-56670-396-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits of a training program==

An effective training program can reduce the number of injuries and [[occupational fatality|deaths]], property damage, legal liability, illnesses, workers' compensation claims, and missed time from work.  An effective safety training program can also help a trainer keep the required OSHA-mandated safety training courses organized and up-to-date.
Safety training classes help establish a safety culture in which employees themselves help promote proper safety procedures while on the job. It is important that new employees be properly trained and embrace the importance of workplace safety as it is easy for seasoned workers to negatively influence the new hires. That negative influence however, can be purged with the establishment of new, hands-on, innovative effective safety training which will ultimately lead to an effective safety culture. A 1998 [[NIOSH]] study concluded that the role of training in developing and maintaining effective hazard control activities is a proven and successful method of intervention.&lt;ref&gt;NIOSH (1998). ''Assessing Occupational Safety and Health Training: a Literature Review'', NIOSH Publication No. 98-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==OSHA's voluntary training guidelines==

OSHA issued voluntary training guidelines in 1992.  These guidelines serve as a model for trainers to use in developing, organizing, evaluating, and editing their safety training programs.  It is important for trainers to tailor the OSHA guidelines to their specific work site so that the training is relevant to the specific working conditions and not just a long generalized informational session.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Many standards promulgated by OSHA explicitly require the employer to train employees in the safety and health aspects of their jobs. Other OSHA standards make it the employer's responsibility to limit certain job assignments to employees who are "certified," "competent," or "qualified"—meaning that they have had special previous training, in or out of the workplace. The term "designated" personnel means selected or assigned by the employer or the employer's representative as being qualified to perform specific duties. These requirements reflect OSHA's belief that training is an essential part of every employer's safety and health program for protecting workers from injuries and illnesses.&lt;ref name="OSHA"&gt;US Department of Labor. ''Training Requirements in OSHA Standards and Training Guidelines''. OSHA 2254 1998 (Revised). https://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha2254.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

OSHA's training guidelines follow a model that consists of:

*A. Determining if Training is Needed
*B. Identifying Training Needs
*C. Identifying Goals and Objectives
*D. Developing learning activities
*E. Conducting the training
*F. Evaluating program effectiveness
*G. Improving the program
*H. Training must align with job tasks.
**'''A. Determining if training is needed'''
You first have to determine if a situation can be solved using training. Training, or retraining as the case may be, could be required by an OSHA standard.  Training is an effective solution to problems such as employee lack of understanding, unfamiliarity with equipment, incorrect execution of a task, lack of attention, or lack of motivation.  Sometimes, however, the situation cannot be mitigated through the use of training and other methods, such as the establishment of engineering controls, may be needed to ensure worker safety.

**'''B. Identifying training needs'''
A [[job safety analysis]] and/or a [[job hazard analysis]] should be conducted with every employee so that it is understood what is needed to do the job safely and what hazards are associated with the job.  A safety trainer may observe the worker in his/her environment to adequately assess the worker's training needs.  Certain employees may need extra training due to the hazards associated with their particular job.  These employees should be trained not only on
how to perform their job safely but also on how to operate within a hazardous
environment.

**'''C. Identifying Goals and Objectives'''
It is important for the Trainer to identify necessary training material.  It is equally important that the trainer identify training material that is not needed to avoid unnecessary training and frustration from their trainees.

At the beginning of every safety training session the trainer should clearly iterate the objectives of the class.  The objectives should be delivered using action oriented words like:  the employee ..."will be able to demonstrate" or "will know when to"... which will help the audience understand what he/she should know by the end of the class or what to information to assimilate during the class. Clearly established objectives also help focus the evaluation process on those skill sets and knowledge requirements necessary to perform the job safely.

**'''D. Developing Learning Activities'''
Training should be hands-on and simulate the job as closely as possible.  Trainers can use instructional aids such as charts, manuals, PowerPoint presentations, and films.  Trainers can also include role-playing, live demonstrations, and round-table group discussions to stimulate employee participation. Games like "what's wrong with this picture" (it is usually good to use pictures of situations found at their specific location)" or "safety jeopardy" can be useful ways to make the training fun yet educational.

**'''E. Conducting the Training'''
Trainers should provide employees with an overview of the material to be learned and relate the training to the employees' experiences.  Employers should also reinforce what the employees have learned by summarizing the program's objectives and key points of training.  At the beginning of the training program, the trainer should show the employees why the material is important and relevant to their jobs.  Employees are more likely to pay attention and apply what they've learned if they know the benefits of the training.&lt;ref name="Barnett"/&gt;

**'''F. Evaluating Program Effectiveness'''
Evaluation will help employers or supervisors determine the amount of learning achieved and whether an employee's performance has improved on the job. Among the methods of evaluating training are:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) Student opinion. Questionnaires or informal discussions with employees can help employers determine the relevance and appropriateness of the training program
***(2) Supervisors' observations.  Supervisors are in good positions to observe an employee's performance both before and after the training and note improvements or changes
***(3) Workplace improvements. The ultimate success of a training program may be changes throughout the workplace that result in reduced injury or accident rates
*** (4) Formal assessments.  Practical and written exams also assist in evaluating understanding of training material.  For example, for a lift-truck operator, a written and a practical exam would identify areas of training that may need to be revisited.  Furthermore administering a pre-test and post-test will establish a knowledge base line or reference point to measure training effectiveness.
**'''G. Improving the Program'''
As evaluations are reviewed, it may be evident the training was not adequate and that the employees did not reach the expected level of knowledge and skill.  As the program is evaluated, the trainer should ask:&lt;ref name="OSHA"/&gt; 
***(1) If a job analysis was conducted, was it accurate?
***(2) Was any critical feature of the job overlooked?
***(3) Were the important gaps in knowledge and skill included?
***(4) Was material already known by the employees intentionally omitted?
***(5) Were the instructional objectives presented clearly and concretely?
***(6) Did the objectives state the level of acceptable performance that was expected of employees?
***(7) Did the learning activity simulate the actual job?
***(8) Was the learning activity appropriate for the kinds of knowledge and skills required on the job?
***(9) When the training was presented, was the organization of the material and its meaning made clear?
***(10) Were the employees motivated to learn?
***(11) Were the employees allowed to participate actively in the training process?
***(12) Was the employer's evaluation of the program thorough?

==Computer and video training==

Computers and videos can be a great addition to a company's safety training program. As stand alone resources, they may not be adequate in meeting OSHA's training requirements as they are not site specific. Computer-based training can help meet the following training challenges&lt;ref&gt;Hubiak, Stacy (1998). "Click On to Effective Training," ''Safety and Health Magazine'', Sept., pg.116&lt;/ref&gt;
*Training employees in remote sites
*Employees who become bored with the same safety training
*Safety managers lack of time and resources to effectively train employees
*Providing a means of documenting and tracking student progress
*Lowering trainer fees or travel costs
*A self-paced, relaxed learning environment

==OSHA Medical Safety==

There is no more important places to regard the positive impact the OSHA regulations than in the healthcare and clinical settings. OSHA has been revolutionary in the medical field due to its ability to prevent the spread of diseases. Every clinical facility on US land, civilian or military is governed by OSHA's directives. To remain in accordance to the Federal regulations enacted by OSHA healthcare administrators must maintain an OSHA safety program and train their employees on an annual basis. Some of the topics that employees must be trained on include:
* Bloodborne Pathogen Standard
* Chemical Hazard Communications
* Tuberculosis Exposure Control
* Mercury Exposure
* Ionizing Radiation Exposure
* Fire Escape Plan
* Emergency Action Plan
* Electricity Safety
* Fire Safety Standard

In [[evolutionary biology]] and  [[population genetics]], the '''error threshold''' (or '''critical mutation rate''') is a limit on the number of [[base pairs]] a self-replicating molecule may have before mutation will destroy the information in subsequent generations of the molecule. The error threshold is crucial to understanding "Eigen's paradox".

The error threshold is a concept in the origins of life ([[abiogenesis]]), in particular of very early life, before the advent of [[DNA]]. It is postulated that the first self-replicating molecules might have been small [[ribozyme]]-like [[RNA]] molecules. These molecules consist of strings of base pairs or "digits",  and their order is a code that directs how the molecule interacts with its environment. All replication is subject to mutation error. During the replication process, each digit has a certain probability of being replaced by some other digit, which changes the way the molecule interacts with its environment, and may increase or decrease its fitness, or ability to reproduce, in that environment.

== Fitness landscape ==
{{main article|Fitness landscape}}
It was noted by [[Manfred Eigen]] in his 1971 paper (Eigen 1971) that this mutation process places a limit on the number of digits a molecule may have. If a molecule exceeds this critical size, the effect of the mutations become overwhelming and a runaway mutation process will destroy the information in subsequent generations of the molecule. The error threshold is also controlled by the fitness landscape for the molecules. Molecules that differ only by a few mutations may be thought of as "close" to each other, while those that differ by many mutations are distant from each other. Molecules that are very fit, and likely to reproduce, have a "high" fitness, those less fit have "low" fitness.

These ideas of proximity and height form the intuitive concept of the "fitness landscape". If a particular sequence and its neighbors have a high fitness, they will form a [[quasispecies model|quasispecies]] and will be able to support longer sequence lengths than a fit sequence with few fit neighbors, or a less fit neighborhood of sequences. Also, it was noted by Wilke (Wilke 2005) that the error threshold concept does not apply in portions of the  landscape where there are lethal mutations, in which the induced mutation yields zero fitness and prohibits the molecule from reproducing.

==Eigen's Paradox==

'''Eigen's paradox'''  is one of the most intractable puzzles in the study of the origins of life.  It is thought that the error threshold concept described above limits the size of self replicating molecules to perhaps a few hundred digits,  yet almost all life on earth requires  much longer molecules to encode their genetic information. This problem is handled in living cells by enzymes that repair mutations, allowing the encoding molecules to reach sizes on the order of millions of base pairs. These large molecules must, of course, encode the very enzymes that repair them, and herein lies Eigen's paradox, first put forth by [[Manfred Eigen]] in his 1971 paper (Eigen 1971). Simply stated, Eigen's paradox amounts to the following:

*  Without error correction enzymes, the maximum size of a replicating molecule is about 100 base pairs.
* For a replicating molecule to encode error correction enzymes, it must be substantially larger than 100 bases.

This is a [[The chicken or the egg|chicken-or-egg]] kind of a paradox, with an even more difficult solution. Which came first, the large genome or the error correction enzymes? A number of solutions to this paradox have been proposed:

* Stochastic corrector model (Szathmáry &amp; Maynard Smith, 1995). In this proposed solution, a number of primitive molecules of say, two different types, are associated with each other in some way, perhaps by a capsule or "cell wall". If their reproductive success is enhanced by having, say, equal numbers in each cell, and reproduction occurs by division in which each of various types of molecules are randomly distributed among the "children", the process of selection will promote such equal representation in the cells, even though one of the molecules may have a selective advantage over the other.
* Relaxed error threshold (Kun et al., 2005) - Studies of actual ribozymes indicate that the mutation rate can be substantially less than first expected - on the order of 0.001 per base pair per replication. This may allow sequence lengths of the order of 7-8 thousand base pairs, sufficient to incorporate rudimentary error correction enzymes.

==A simple mathematical model==
Consider a 3-digit molecule [A,B,C] where A, B, and C can take on the values 0 and 1. There are eight such sequences ([000], [001], [010], [011], [100], [101], [110], and [111]). Let's say that the [000] molecule is the most fit; upon each replication it produces an average of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; copies, where &lt;math&gt;a&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. This molecule is called the "master sequence". The other seven sequences are less fit; they each produce only 1 copy per replication. The replication of each of the three digits is done with a mutation rate of μ. In other words, at every replication of a digit of a sequence, there is a probability &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; that it will be erroneous; 0 will be replaced by 1 or vice versa. Let's ignore double mutations and the death of molecules (the population will grow infinitely), and divide the eight molecules into three classes depending on their [[Hamming distance]] from the master sequence:

:{| class="wikitable"
|-
|'''Hamming&lt;br&gt;distance''' || '''Sequence(s)'''
|-
|align=center| 0 
|align=center| [000]
|-
|align=center| 1 
|align=center| [001]&lt;br&gt;[010]&lt;br&gt;[100]
|-
|align=center| 2 
|align=center| [110]&lt;br&gt;[101]&lt;br&gt;[011]
|-
|align=center| 3 
|align=center| [111]
|}

Note that the number of sequences for distance ''d'' is just the [[binomial coefficient]] &lt;math&gt;\tbinom L d &lt;/math&gt; for L=3, and that each sequence can be visualized as the vertex of an L=3  dimensional cube,  with each edge of the cube specifying a mutation path in which the change Hamming distance is either zero or ±1. It can be seen that, for example, one third of the mutations of the [001] molecules will produce [000] molecules, while the other two thirds will produce the class 2 molecules [011] and [101]. We can now write the expression for the child populations &lt;math&gt;n'_i&lt;/math&gt; of class ''i'' in terms of the parent populations &lt;math&gt;n_j&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;n'_i=\sum_{j=0}^3 w_{ij}n_j&lt;/math&gt;

where the matrix '''w''’ that incorporates natural selection and mutation, according to [[quasispecies model]], is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}=
\begin{bmatrix}
a\cdot Q&amp;3a\cdot\mu&amp;0&amp;0\\
\mu&amp;Q&amp;2\mu&amp;0\\
0&amp;2\mu&amp;Q&amp;\mu\\
0&amp;0&amp;3\mu&amp;Q
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q=(1-\mu)^L&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that an entire molecule will be replicated successfully. The [[eigenvectors]] of the '''w''' matrix will yield the equilibrium population numbers for each class. For example, if the mutation rate μ is zero, we will have Q=1, and the equilibrium concentrations will be &lt;math&gt;[n_0,n_1,n_2,n_3]=[1,0,0,0]&lt;/math&gt;. The master sequence, being the fittest will be the only one to survive. If we have a replication fidelity of Q=0.95 and genetic advantage of a=1.05, then the equilibrium concentrations will be roughly &lt;math&gt;[0.33,0.38,0.24,0.06]&lt;/math&gt;. It can be seen that the master sequence is not as dominant, however, sequences with low Hamming distance are in majority. If we have a replication fidelity of Q approaching 0, then the equilibrium concentrations will be roughly &lt;math&gt;[0.125,0.375,0.375,0.125]&lt;/math&gt;. This is a population with equal number of each of 8 sequences. (If we had perfectly equal population of all sequences, we would have populations of [1,3,3,1]/8.)

If we now go to the case where the number of base pairs is large, say L=100, we obtain behavior that resembles a phase transition. The plot below on the left shows a series of equilibrium concentrations divided by the binomial coefficient &lt;math&gt;\tbinom {100} k &lt;/math&gt;.
(This multiplication will show the population for an individual sequence at that distance,  and will yield a flat line for an equal distribution.) The selective advantage of the master sequence is set at a=1.05.  The horizontal axis is the Hamming distance ''d''&amp;nbsp;. The various curves are for various total  mutation rates &lt;math&gt;(1-Q)&lt;/math&gt;. It is seen that for low values of the total mutation rate, the population consists of a [[quasispecies]] gathered in the neighborhood of the master sequence. Above a total mutation rate of about 1-Q=0.05, the distribution quickly spreads out to populate all sequences equally. The plot below on the right shows the fractional population of the master sequence as a function of the total mutation rate. Again it is seen that below a critical mutation rate of about 1-Q=0.05, the master sequence contains most of the population, while above this rate, it contains only about &lt;math&gt;2^{-L}\approx 10^{-30}&lt;/math&gt; of the total population.

[[Image:ErrorThreshold1.png|thumb|left|325px|Population numbers as a function of Hamming distance ''d'' and mutation rate (1-Q). The horizontal axis ''d''&amp;nbsp; is the Hamming distance of the molecular sequences from the master sequence. The vertical axis is the logarithm of population for any sequence at that distance divided by total population (thus the division of ''n&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;'' by the binomial coefficient). The total number of digits per sequence is L=100, and the master sequence has a selective advantage of a=1.05.]]

[[Image:ErrorThreshold2.png|thumb|right|325px|The population of the master sequence as a fraction of the total population (''n'') as a function of overall mutation rate (1-Q). The total number of digits per sequence is L=100, and the master sequence has a selective advantage of a=1.05. The "phase transition" is seen to occur at roughly 1-Q=0.05.]]

{{clear}}

It can be seen that there is a sharp transition at a value of ''1-Q''&amp;nbsp; just a bit larger than 0.05. For mutation rates above this value, the population of the master sequence drops to practically zero. Above this value, it dominates.

In the limit as ''L'' approaches infinity, the system does in fact have a phase transition at a critical value of Q: &lt;math&gt;Q_c=1/a.&lt;/math&gt;. One could think of the overall mutation rate (1-Q) as a sort of "temperature", which "melts" the fidelity of the molecular sequences above the critical "temperature" of &lt;math&gt;1-Q_c&lt;/math&gt;. For faithful replication to occur, the information must be "frozen" into the genome.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2900">The '''Galton Laboratory''' was a laboratory for research into [[eugenics]] and then into human [[genetics]] based at [[University College London]] in [[London]], England. It was originally established in 1904, and became part of UCL's biology department in 1996.

The ancestor of the Galton Laboratory was the Eugenics Record Office founded by [[Francis Galton]] in 1904. In 1907 the Office was reconstituted as the Galton Eugenics Laboratory as part of UCL and under the direction of [[Karl Pearson]] the Professor of Applied Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Magnello, M. E.|title=The Non-correlation of Biometrics and Eugenics: Rival Forms of Laboratory Work in Karl Pearson’s Career at University College London, (In two Parts)|journal=History of Science|volume=37|pages=79–106; 125–150|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galton financed the Laboratory and on his death left UCL enough money to create a chair in National Eugenics which Pearson filled. The Laboratory published a series of memoirs and in 1925 Pearson created the Annals of Eugenics, which continues as the [[Annals of Human Genetics]]. The journal has always been edited at the Galton. Pearson was succeeded as Galton Professor by R. A. Fisher in 1934. The post-war Galton Professors were [[Lionel Penrose]] up to 1965, Harry Harris to 1976 and Bette Robson until 1994. [[J.B.S. Haldane]] held the Chair of Biometry here and was succeeded by [[Cedric Smith (statistician)|C.A.B. Smith]]. The Galton Laboratory became part of the Department of Biology in UCL in 1996. MRC Human Biochemical Genetics Unit was established by Harris in 1962. He was Hon. Director until he went to Philadelphia in 1976, and the Unit continued under the direction of David Hopkinson until its closure in October 2000.

'''Gene–environment interaction''' (or '''genotype–environment interaction''' or '''GxE''' or '''G×E''') is when two different [[genotypes]] respond to environmental variation in different ways. A [[norm of reaction]] is a graph that shows the relationship between [[genes]] and [[environmental factors]] when phenotypic differences are continuous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Introduction to Behavioural Ecology|vauthors=Krebs JR|date=April 2, 2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1405114169|location=Oxford}}&lt;!--|access-date=19 October 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They can help illustrate GxE interactions. When the norm of reaction is not parallel, as shown in the figure below, there is a gene by environment interaction. This indicates that each genotype responds to environmental variation in a different way. Environmental variation can be physical, chemical, biological, behavior patterns or life events.&lt;ref name="Ottman 1996 764–770"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ottman R | title = Gene–environment interaction: definitions and study designs | journal = Preventive Medicine | volume = 25 | issue = 6 | pages = 764–70 | date = 1996 | pmid = 8936580 | pmc = 2823480 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Norm of Reaction.jpg|thumb|This norm of reaction shows lines that are not parallel indicating a gene by environment interaction. Each genotype is responding to environmental variation in a different way.]]

Gene–environment interactions are studied to gain a better understanding of various phenomena. In [[genetic epidemiology]], gene–environment interactions are useful for understanding some [[diseases]]. Sometimes, sensitivity to environmental [[risk factors]] for a disease are inherited rather than the disease itself being inherited. Individuals with different genotypes are affected differently by exposure to the same environmental factors, and thus gene–environment interactions can result in different disease phenotypes. For example, sunlight exposure has a stronger influence on [[skin cancer]] risk in [[Human skin color|fair-skinned humans than in individuals with darker skin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Green A, Trichopoulos D | chapter = Skin cancer | title = Textbook of Cancer Epidemiology | veditors = Adami H, Hunter D, Trichopoulos D | pages = 281–300 | publisher= Oxford University Press | location= Oxford | year= 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These interactions are of particular interest to [[Genetic epidemiology|genetic epidemiologists]] for predicting disease rates and methods of prevention with respect to public health.&lt;ref name="Ottman 1996 764–770"/&gt; The term is also used amongst [[Developmental psychobiology|developmental psychobiologists]] to better understand individual and evolutionary development.&lt;ref name="tabery2010" /&gt;

[[Nature versus nurture]] debates assume that variation in a trait is primarily due to either genetic differences or environmental differences. However, the current scientific opinion holds that neither genetic differences nor environmental differences are solely responsible for producing phenotypic variation, and that virtually all traits are influenced by both genetic and environmental differences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Matt Ridley|Ridley, M.]] (2003) ''[[Nature via Nurture: Genes, Experience, &amp; What Makes Us Human]]''. Harper Collins. {{ISBN|0-00-200663-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rutter, Michael.

[[Statistical analysis]] of the genetic and environmental differences contributing to the phenotype would have to be used to confirm these as gene–environment interactions. In developmental genetics, a causal interaction is enough to confirm gene–environment interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444327632.ch3/summary|title=Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics|last=Tabery|first=James|last2=Griffiths|first2=Paul E. | name-list-format = vanc |date=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=9781444327632|editor-last=Hood|editor-first=Kathryn E.|pages=39–60 |doi=10.1002/9781444327632.ch3/summary|editor-last2=Halpern|editor-first2=Carolyn Tucker|editor-last3=Greenberg|editor-first3=Gary|editor-last4=Lerner|editor-first4=Richard M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of the definition ==
The history of defining gene–environment interaction dates back to the 1930s and remains a topic of debate today. The first instance of debate occurred between [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[Lancelot Hogben]].

Fisher sought to eliminate interaction from statistical studies as it was a phenomenon that could be removed using a variation in scale. Hogben believed that the interaction should be investigated instead of eliminated as it provided information on the causation of certain elements of development.

A similar argument faced multiple scientists in the 1970s. [[Arthur Jensen]] published the study “[[How Much Can We Boost IQ and Scholastic Achievement?|How much can we boost IQ and scholastic achievement?]]”, which amongst much criticism also faced contention by scientists Richard Lewontin and David Layzer. Lewontin and Layzer argued that in order to conclude causal mechanisms, the gene–environment interaction could not be ignored in the context of the study while Jensen defended that interaction was purely a statistical phenomenon and not related to development.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabery J | title = Debating interaction: the history, and an explanation | journal = International Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 44 | issue = 4 | pages = 1117–23 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 25855719 | doi = 10.1093/ije/dyv053 | url = https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/44/4/1117/671225 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, Kenneth J. Rothman supported the use of a statistical definition for interaction while researchers Kupper and Hogan believed the definition and existence of interaction was dependent on the model being used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rothman KJ, Greenland S, Walker AM | title = Concepts of interaction | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 112 | issue = 4 | pages = 467–70 | date = October 1980 | pmid = 7424895 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most recent criticisms were spurred by Moffitt and Caspi's studies on ''[[5-HTTLPR]]'' and stress and its influence on depression. In contrast to previous debates, Moffitt and Caspi were now using the statistical analysis to prove that interaction existed and could be used to uncover the mechanisms of a vulnerability trait. Contention came from Zammit, Owen and Lewis who reiterated the concerns of Fisher in that the statistical effect was not related to the developmental process and would not be replicable with a difference of scale.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Definitions ==
There are two different conceptions of gene–environment interaction today. Tabery&lt;ref name="tabery2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tabery J | title = Biometric and developmental gene–environment interactions: looking back, moving forward | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 19 | issue = 4 | pages = 961–76 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17931428 | doi = 10.1017/s0954579407000478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; has labeled them ''biometric'' and ''developmental'' interaction, while Sesardic&lt;ref&gt;Sesardic, N. (2005). ''Making sense of heritability''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; uses the terms ''statistical'' and ''commonsense'' interaction.

The biometric (or statistical) conception has its origins in research programs that seek to measure the relative proportions of genetic and environmental contributions to phenotypic variation within populations. Biometric gene–environment interaction has particular currency in [[population genetics]] and [[behavioral genetics]].&lt;ref name="tabery2007"/&gt; Any interaction results in the breakdown of the additivity of the [[main effect]]s of heredity and environment, but whether such interaction is present in particular settings is an empirical question. Biometric interaction is relevant in the context of research on individual differences rather than in the context of the development of a particular organism.&lt;ref name="tabery2010"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Tabery | first1 = James | last2 = Griffiths | first2 = Paul E. | year = 2010 | chapter = Historical and Philosophical Perspectives on Behavioral Genetics and Developmental Science |  veditors = Hood KE, Halpern CT, Greenberg G, Lerner RM | title = Handbook of Developmental Science, Behavior, and Genetics | publisher = Wiley-Blackwell | pages = 41–60 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental gene–environment interaction is a concept more commonly used by [[Developmental genetics|developmental geneticists]] and [[Developmental psychobiology|developmental psychobiologists]]. Developmental interaction is not seen merely as a statistical phenomenon. Whether statistical interaction is present or not, developmental interaction is in any case manifested in the causal interaction of genes and environments in producing an individual's phenotype.&lt;ref name="tabery2010"/&gt;

== Epidemiological models of GxE ==
In epidemiology, the following models can be used to group the different interactions between gene and environment.

Model A describes a genotype that increases the level of expression of a risk factor but does not cause the disease itself. For example, the PKU gene results in higher levels of phenylalanine than normal which in turn causes mental retardation.

The risk factor in Model B in contrast has a direct effect on disease susceptibility which is amplified by the genetic susceptibility. Model C depicts the inverse, where the genetic susceptibility directly effects disease while the risk factor amplifies this effect. In each independent situation, the factor directly effecting the disease can cause disease by itself.

Model D differs as neither factor in this situation can effect disease risk, however, when both genetic susceptibility and risk factor are present the risk is increased. For example, the G6PD deficiency gene when combined with fava bean consumption results in hemolytic anemia. This disease does not arise in individuals that eat fava beans and lack G6PD deficiency nor in G6PD-deficient people who do not eat fava beans.

Lastly, Model E depicts a scenario where the environmental risk factor and genetic susceptibility can individually both influence disease risk. When combined, however, the effect on disease risk differs.

The models are limited by the fact that the variables are binary and so do not consider polygenic or continuous scale variable scenarios.&lt;ref name="Ottman 1996 764–770"/&gt;

== Methods of analysis ==

=== Traditional genetic designs ===

==== Adoption studies ====
Adoption studies have been used to investigate how similar individuals that have been adopted are to their biological parents with whom they did not share the same environment with. Additionally, adopted individuals are compared to their adoptive family due to the difference in genes but shared environment. For example, an adoption study showed that Swedish men with disadvantaged adoptive environments and a genetic predisposition were more likely to abuse alcohol.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dick DM | title = Gene–environment interaction in psychological traits and disorders | journal = Annual Review of Clinical Psychology | volume = 7 | pages = 383–409 | date = 2011 | pmid = 21219196 | pmc = 3647367 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-032210-104518 | url = http://journals.scholarsportal.info/details/15485943/v7inone/383_giiptad.xml }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Twin studies ====
Using [[Twin|monozygotic twins]], the effects of different environments on identical genotypes could be observed. Later studies leverage biometrical modelling techniques to include the comparisons of dizygotic twins to ultimately determine the different levels of gene expression in different environments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Family studies ====
Family-based research focuses on the comparison of low-risk controls to high risk children to determine the environmental effect on subjects with different levels of genetic risk. For example, a Danish study on high-risk children with schizophrenic mothers depicted that children without a stable caregiver were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Molecular analyses ===

==== Interaction with single genes ====
The often used method to detect gene–environment interactions is by studying the effect a single gene variation ([[candidate gene]]) has with respect to a particular environment. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP’s) are compared with single binary exposure factors to determine any effects.

Candidate studies such as these require strong biological hypotheses which are currently difficult to select given the little understanding of biological mechanisms that lead to higher risk.

These studies are also often difficult to replicate commonly due to small sample sizes which typically results in disputed results.

The [[Polygene|polygenic]] nature of complex phenotypes suggests single candidate studies could be ineffective in determining the various smaller scale effects from the large number of influencing gene variants.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Assary E, Vincent JP, Keers R, Pluess M | title = Gene–environment interaction and psychiatric disorders: Review and future directions | journal = Seminars in Cell &amp; Developmental Biology | volume = 77 | pages = 133–143 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29051054 | doi = 10.1016/j.semcdb.2017.10.016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Interaction with multiple genes ====
Since the same environmental factor could interact with multiple genes, a polygenic approach can be taken to analyze GxE interactions. A [[polygenic score]] is generated using the alleles associated with a trait and their respective weights based on effect and examined in combination with environmental exposure. Though this method of research is still early, it is consistent with psychiatric disorders.  As a result of the overlap of endophenotypes amongst disorders this suggests that the outcomes of gene–environment interactions are applicable across various diagnoses.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Genome-wide association studies and genome wide interaction studies ====
A genome wide interaction scan (GEWIS) approach examines the interaction between the environment and a large number of independent SNP’s. An effective approach to this all-encompassing study occurs in two-steps where the genome is first filtered using gene-level tests and pathway based gene set analyses. The second step uses the SNP’s with G–E association and tests for interaction.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Winham SJ, Biernacka JM | title = Gene–environment interactions in genome-wide association studies: current approaches and new directions | journal = Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, and Allied Disciplines | volume = 54 | issue = 10 | pages = 1120–34 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23808649 | pmc = 3829379 | doi = 10.1111/jcpp.12114 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differential susceptibility hypothesis has been reaffirmed through genome wide approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keers R, Coleman JR, Lester KJ, Roberts S, Breen G, Thastum M, Bögels S, Schneider S, Heiervang E, Meiser-Stedman R, Nauta M, Creswell C, Thirlwall K, Rapee RM, Hudson JL, Lewis C, Plomin R, Eley TC | title = A Genome-Wide Test of the Differential Susceptibility Hypothesis Reveals a Genetic Predictor of Differential Response to Psychological Treatments for Child Anxiety Disorders | journal = Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics | volume = 85 | issue = 3 | pages = 146–58 | date = 2016 | pmid = 27043157 | pmc = 5079103 | doi = 10.1159/000444023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==

=== Lack of replication ===
A particular concern with gene–environment interaction studies is the lack of reproducibility. Specifically [[complex traits]] studies have come under scrutiny for producing results that cannot be replicated. For example, studies of the [[5-HTTLPR]] gene and stress resulting in modified risk of depression have had conflicting results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caspi A, Hariri AR, Holmes A, Uher R, Moffitt TE | title = Genetic sensitivity to the environment: the case of the serotonin transporter gene and its implications for studying complex diseases and traits | journal = The American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 167 | issue = 5 | pages = 509–27 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20231323 | pmc = 2943341 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.2010.09101452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A possible explanation behind the inconsistent results is the heavy use of multiple testing. Studies are suggested to produce inaccurate results due to the investigation of multiple phenotypes and environmental factors in individual experiments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Additive vs multiplicative model ===
There are two different models for the scale of measurement that helps determine if gene–environment interaction exists in a statistical context. There is disagreement on which scale should be used. Under these analyses, if the combined variables fit either model then there is no interaction. The combined effects must either be greater for synergistic or less than for an antagonistic outcome. The additive model measures risk differences while the multiplicative model uses ratios to measure effects. The additive model has been suggested to be a better fit for predicting disease risk in a population while a multiplicative model is more appropriate for disease etiology.&lt;ref name="Ottman 1996 764–770"/&gt;

Epigenetics is an example of an underlying mechanism of gene–environment effects, however, it does not conclude whether environment effects are additive, multiplicative or interactive.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

== Gene '''×''' environment '''×''' environment interactions ==
New studies have also revealed the interactive effect of multiple environment factors. For example, a child with a poor quality environment would be more sensitive to a poor environment as an adult which ultimately led to higher psychological distress scores. This depicts a three way interaction Gene x Environment x Environment. The same study suggests taking a life course approach to determining genetic sensitivity to environmental influences within the scope of mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grabe HJ, Schwahn C, Mahler J, Schulz A, Spitzer C, Fenske K, Appel K, Barnow S, Nauck M, Schomerus G, Biffar R, Rosskopf D, John U, Völzke H, Freyberger HJ | title = Moderation of adult depression by the serotonin transporter promoter variant (5-HTTLPR), childhood abuse and adult traumatic events in a general population sample | journal = American Journal of Medical Genetics.

==Medical significance==
Doctors are interested in knowing whether disease can be prevented by reducing exposure to environmental risks. Some people carry genetic factors that confer susceptibility or resistance to a certain disorder in a particular environment. The interaction between the genetic factors and environmental stimulus is what results in the disease phenotype.&lt;ref name="haga2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Haga SB, Burke W | title = Using pharmacogenetics to improve drug safety and efficacy | journal = JAMA | volume = 291 | issue = 23 | pages = 2869–71 | date = June 2004 | pmid = 15199039 | doi = 10.1001/jama.291.23.2869 | url = http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=198914 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There may be significant [[public health]] benefits in using gene by environment interactions to prevent or cure disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khoury MJ, Davis R, Gwinn M, Lindegren ML, Yoon P | title = Do we need genomic research for the prevention of common diseases with environmental causes? | journal = American Journal of Epidemiology | volume = 161 | issue = 9 | pages = 799–805 | date = May 2005 | pmid = 15840611 | doi = 10.1093/aje/kwi113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An individual’s response to a drug can result from various gene by environment interactions.&lt;ref name="haga2004" /&gt; Therefore, the clinical importance of [[pharmacogenetics]] and gene by environment interactions comes from the possibility that genomic, along with environmental information, will allow more accurate predictions of an individual’s drug response.  This would allow doctors to more precisely select a certain drug and dosage to achieve therapeutic response in a patient while minimizing side effects and [[adverse drug reactions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Eichelbaum M, Ingelman-Sundberg M, Evans WE | title = Pharmacogenomics and individualized drug therapy | journal = Annual Review of Medicine | volume = 57 | pages = 119–37 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16409140 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104724 | url = http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.med.56.082103.104724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This information could also help to prevent the health care costs associated with adverse drug reactions and inconveniently prescribing drugs to patients who likely won’t respond to them.&lt;ref name="haga2004" /&gt;

In a similar manner, an individual can respond to other environmental stimuli, factors or challenges differently according to specific genetic differences or alleles. These other factors include the diet and specific nutrients within the diet, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use, sleep (bed time, duration), and any of a number of exposures (or [[exposome]]), including toxins, pollutants, sunlight (latitude north/south of the equator), among any number of others. The diet, for example, is modifiable and has significant impact on a host of cardiometabolic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, coronary artery disease, coronary heart disease, [[type 2 diabetes]], [[hypertension]], [[stroke]], [[myocardial infarction]], and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. In the clinic, typically assessed risks of these conditions include blood lipids (triglyceride, and HDL, LDL and total cholesterol), glycemic traits (plasma glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, beta cell function as HOMA-BC), obesity anthropometrics (BMI/obesity, adiposity, body weight, waist circumference, waist-to-hip ratio), vascular measures (diastolic and systolic blood pressure), and biomarkers of inflammation. Gene–environment interactions can modulate the adverse effects of an allele that confers increased risk of disease, or can exacerbate the genotype–phenotype relationship and increase risk, in a manner often referred to as [[nutrigenetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ordovas JM | title = Genotype–phenotype associations: modulation by diet and obesity | journal = Obesity | volume = 16 Suppl 3 | pages = S40-6 | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19037211 | pmc = 2771769 | doi = 10.1038/oby.2008.515 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A catalog of genetic variants that associate with these and related cardiometabolic phenotypes and modified by common environmental factors is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Parnell LD, Blokker BA, Dashti HS, Nesbeth PD, Cooper BE, Ma Y, Lee YC, Hou R, Lai CQ, Richardson K, Ordovás JM | title = CardioGxE, a catalog of gene–environment interactions for cardiometabolic traits | journal = BioData Mining | volume = 7 | pages = 21 | date = 2014 | pmid = 25368670 | doi = 10.1186/1756-0381-7-21 | url = http://www.biodatamining.org/content/7/1/21/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, a disease study using breast cancer, type 2 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis shows that including GxE interactions in a risk prediction model does not improve risk identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Aschard H, Chen J, Cornelis MC, Chibnik LB, Karlson EW, Kraft P | title = Inclusion of gene–gene and gene–environment interactions unlikely to dramatically improve risk prediction for complex diseases | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 90 | issue = 6 | pages = 962–72 | date = June 2012 | pmid = 22633398 | pmc = 3370279 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2012.04.017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drosophila Bristle Number.png|thumb|Mean bristle number by °C]]

# In ''[[Drosophila]]'': A classic example of gene–environment interaction was performed on ''Drosophila'' by Gupta and Lewontin in 1981. In their experiment they demonstrated that the mean bristle number on ''Drosophila'' could vary with changing temperatures. As seen in the graph to the right, different genotypes reacted differently to the changing environment. Each line represents a given genotype, and the slope of the line reflects the changing phenotype (bristle number) with changing temperature. Some individuals had an increase in bristle number with increasing temperature while others had a sharp decrease in bristle number with increasing temperature. This showed that the norms of reaction were not parallel for these flies, proving that gene–environment interactions exist.&lt;ref name="Anand P. Gupta and R. C.

One cutting of each genotype was planted at low, medium, and high elevations, respectively.

For example, one genotype grew the tallest at the medium elevation but attained only middling height at the other two elevations. The best growers at low and high elevation grew poorly at medium elevation. The medium altitude produced the worst overall results, but still yielded one tall and two medium-tall samples.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7745">'''Geography of aging''' or '''gerontological geography''' is an emerging field of knowledge of [[Human Geography]] that analyzes the socio-spatial implications of [[aging]] of the [[population]] from the understanding of the relationships between the [[Social environment|physical-social environment]] and the [[elderly]], at different scales, micro (City, region, country), etc.

Since the 1970s in a number of developed countries such as the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Japan]], there have been increasing studies focusing on the understanding of spatial patterns of [[aging population]], as well as aspects related to residential changes and provision of health and social services. Among the geographers of aging is S. Harper, who identified the phenomenon of aging associated with the social construction of old age and the processes of residential mobility of this group to the urban periphery, mainly nursing homes and sheltered housing.

The contribution of geographers of aging, such as Graham D. Rowles, SM. Golant, S. Harper, G. Laws, are contributing to environmental gerontology by understanding the environmental aspects of [[gerontology]] in developed and developing countries. Also in Spain, some geographers, such as Gloria Fernández-Mayoralas, Fermina Rojo-Pérez and Vicente Rodríguez-Rodríguez, have made outstanding contributions to the study of residential strategies, access to health services, and, in general, quality of Life of the elderly, as well as the impacts of Northern European retirees on the Costa del Sol (Spain).

In [[Latin America]] and [[Spain]], Diego Sánchez-González has shed light on the deepening of issues such as the physical-built and [[social environment]] and the [[quality of life]] of the [[elderly]]; the importance of the [[natural environment]] (therapeutic [[natural landscape]]) on active and [[healthy aging]] in the place; residential strategies for the maintenance of the elderly in the communities; the socio-environmental [[vulnerability]] of the elderly in the face of [[climate change]]; as well as issues related to the attachment to the place (identity and [[public space]]); elderly people with [[disabilities]] and [[social exclusion]]; [[leisure]] and [[tourism]] of elderly; and the [[planning]] of gerontological and geriatric services.

[[Image:GBM-passiv.jpg|thumb|Passive glass break detector]]

A '''glass break detector''' is a sensor used in electronic burglar alarms that detects if a pane of glass is shattered or broken. These sensors are commonly used near glass doors or glass store-front windows.

Glass break detectors usually use a microphone, which monitors any noise or vibrations coming from the glass. If the vibrations exceed a certain threshold (that is sometimes user selectable) they are analyzed by detector circuitry. Simpler detectors simply use narrowband microphones tuned to frequencies typical of glass shattering, and react to sound above certain threshold, whereas more complex designs compare the sound analysis to one or more glass-break profiles using signal transforms similar to [[Discrete cosine transform|DCT]] and [[Fast Fourier transform|FFT]] and react if both the amplitude threshold and statistically expressed similarity threshold are breached.

'''The Hockerton Housing Project''' is a small community of five [[earth sheltering|earth sheltered]] homes on the outskirts of [[Hockerton]], Nottinghamshire, UK.

The houses were designed by ‘green’ [[architects]] [[Brenda and Robert Vale|Professor Brenda Vale and Dr Robert Vale]].&lt;ref&gt;Energy Saving Trust, The Hockerton Housing Project: a case study&lt;/ref&gt; Low carbon living is facilitated through the use of renewable energy, the water system, food grown on site, and the community's approach to work and transport.&lt;ref&gt;East Midlands Regional Assembly, "UK’s first earth-sheltered, self-sufficient ecological housing development", www.emra.gov.uk, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The homes were completed in September 1998 after three years of planning and 18 months of construction, at a cost of about £65,000.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, Hockerton housing: low impact living, http://www.ecology.co.uk/html/aboutus/casestudies/hockerton.htm, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Two homes have since changed ownership on the open property market.

==Layout==
The development consists of a terrace of five single story dwellings which are earth-sheltered at the rear (North), so that the ground surface slopes and blends smoothly into the field at the back. The houses have [[passive solar]] heating (a combination of high [[thermal mass]] and the south-facing conservatory) removing the need for a space heating system and the greatest factor in lowering energy use.

Each house is 6 metres deep with a 19 metre conservatory to the south. This runs the full width of each dwelling. A repeated modular bay system of 3.2m in width was used for ease and cost of construction. Most of the internal rooms have 3 metre high French windows linking them to the conservatory. Those rooms that are not so dependent on natural light, such as utility and bathing areas are located towards the rear of the homes.

The surrounding 40,000 square metre site allows for crop cultivation, the rearing of sheep and chickens, and self-sufficiency in water and energy.&lt;ref&gt;EST,ibid&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy generation and use==
Two [[wind turbines]] and a [[solar photovoltaic]] system provide most of the energy required to run the homes. All systems are grid linked, which allows for both import of energy during periods of supply shortfall, and export for periods of excess energy production. The excess exported offsets the imported energy from the grid.

•	6&amp;nbsp;kW proven [[wind turbine]] installed early 2002 year (upgraded in 2008) &lt;br /&gt;
•	7.65&amp;nbsp;kW peak array of [[photovoltaics]] (solar electric) installed August 2002 complimenting wind power.&lt;br /&gt;
•	5&amp;nbsp;kW Iskra [[wind turbine]] installed in 2005 – installed as part of construction of a community building

The typical energy use for the house is about 10kWhrs/day (all electric). This is about 10% of a typical UK home. The majority of the electricity use is generated by the on-site renewables which has reduced energy bills to about £100/annum. This is offset by income from [[Renewables Obligation]] certificates, and may in future benefit from [[feed-in tariff]]s.

==Water capture, use and processing&lt;ref&gt;NARYANAN, Narvi, WHITE, Trudi, KRAUSS, Terry, JONES-Lofting, Chris, "Water Supply and Irrigation Systems", Geographical, Mar2000, Vol. 72 Issue 3, p90, 2p&lt;/ref&gt;==
There are two water capture and treatment systems.

'''Non-drinking water:'''Rainfall on the fields is channeled to a sump from where it is pumped to a reservoir to the north of the buildings. This reservoir holds enough water for 250 days. The water is sand filtered and treated with chlorine before entering the homes.

'''Drinking or potable water:'''Drinking water is captured from the conservatory roofs in copper pipes, which are slightly antiseptic, and stored in a tank that holds at least 100 days worth of drinking water. The water is passed through 3 filters before it enters the homes: a five-micrometre string filter, a carbon filter and then a UV-light filter which kills bacteria and viruses.

'''Water use''' is reduced through low-flush toilets and flow-restrictors on shower heads. Detergent free laundry balls keep the water unpolluted.

'''Processing waste water:'''A [[reed bed]] sewage system is in place to process waste water. Solid waste is captured in a septic tank. This is emptied each quarter and waste is composted on-site. Liquid waste then takes 100 days to pass through the reed-bed, with the reeds roots breaking down the liquid effluent.

==Co-operation and community==
All residents own their homes but are also members of a co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;Ecology Building Society, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Each home, as part of the lease, undertakes to spend 300 unpaid hours per year on managing and maintaining the site, from the infrastructure of the energy and water systems through to lambing and growing food; and 300 paid hours per year supporting the joint business which runs tours and educational events, hosts away-days and consulting on both new and retrofit energy efficient building.&lt;ref&gt;Hockerton Housing Project, FAQ, http://www.hockertonhousingproject.org.uk/SEFS/ID.780/SEFE/ViewItem.asp, last accessed 25 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hovenring 3 Eindhoven.jpg|thumb|right|Hovenring]]

The '''Hovenring''' is a suspended [[bicycle path|cycle path]] [[roundabout]] in the province of [[North Brabant]] in the [[Netherlands]] and the first of its kind in the world.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/167810712/Fietsrotonde+Hovenring+Eindhoven+afgesloten+kabels+op+knappen+-+fotos+en+video.aspx |title=Fietsrotonde Hovenring Eindhoven afgesloten: kabels op knappen |author=Jan de Vries |date=11 January 2012 |work=Omroep Brabant |publisher=[[Omroep Brabant]] |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is situated in between the localities of [[Eindhoven]], [[Veldhoven]], and [[Meerhoven]], which account for its name.

==History==
The Hovenring was first conceived of in 2008, when increased traffic between Eindhoven and Veldhoven was starting to overwhelm the capacity of the [[roundabout]] on the crossing of the roads known as ''Heerbaan'' in Veldhoven and the ''Meerenakkerweg'' (''Heistraat'').&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectenweb.nl/aweb/redactie/redactie_detail.asp?iNID=13468 |title=Eindhoven krijgt markante fietsbrug |date= 1 April 2008 |publisher=Architectenweb |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/verkeer-vervoer/de-hovenring-3/De-Hovenring-verbetert-infrastructuur.htm |title=De Hovenring verbetert infrastructuur |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Municipality of Eindhoven |accessdate=17 July 2012 |language=nl }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to improve the flow of traffic and improve safety, it was decided to completely separate motorized and bicycle traffic.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb0"/&gt; In addition, it was decided to transform the roundabout for cars into a regular crossing of streets, to improve the flow of traffic.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv0"/&gt; This left a decision to be made about what to do about the bicycle traffic. The city council of Eindhoven decided that they wanted to develop an eye-catching project, in keeping with ambitions of the ''Brainport'' top technology region (a [[knowledge economy]]-driven cooperative of the [[municipality|municipalities]] in the Eindhoven metropolitan area).&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv0"/&gt;

The design for the Hovenring was made by the ''ipv Delft'' [[design|design agency]].&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb0"/&gt; The name was chosen through a competition held among the population of Eindhoven and Veldhoven. Literally the name means "ring of the Hovens", referring to Eindhoven, Veldhoven and Meerhoven (the [[residential area]] where the Hovenring is). In addition, the name refers to the suspended ring of the Hovenring, as well as to the ring and needle (the central pylon) of lights that are formed by the lights that adorn the construction.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eindhoven.nl/stad/verkeer-vervoer/de-hovenring-3/Het-ontstaan-van-de-naam-de-Hovenring.htm |title=Het ontstaan van de naam de Hovenring |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Municipality of Eindhoven |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the addition of the lights, the name also refers to Eindhoven's unofficial designation of "city of lights".&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_gemehv1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bike-infrastructure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theenvironmentalblog.org/bike-the-netherlands/|title=Bike The Netherlands|accessdate=2012-10-15|author=John Tarantino |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |publisher=The Environmental Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The construction started on 11 February 2011. The new crossing was opened on 30 December 2011.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_archweb1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.architectenweb.nl/aweb/redactie/redactie_detail.asp?iNID=25406 |title=Start bouw tuibrug Eindhoven van ipv Delft
 |date=11 February 2011 |publisher=Architectenweb |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a week later, the crossing was again closed for all traffic, because the suspension cables were found to vibrate in a manner that was considered harmful. The Hovenring was finally opened to the public on 29 June 2012.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/176811762/Hovenring+tussen+Eindhoven+en+Veldhoven+officieel+geopend.aspx |title=Hovenring tussen Eindhoven en Veldhoven officieel geopend

The Hovenring is officially a roundabout, but in fact it is a [[circle|circular]] [[cable-stayed bridge]]&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_tw0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.technischweekblad.nl/zwevende-fietsrotonde-in-eindhoven.275611.lynkx |title='Zwevende' fietsrotonde in Eindhoven |date=13 July 2012 |publisher=Technish Weekblad |accessdate=17 July 2012|language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the {{convert|72|m}} diameter deck suspended from a single {{convert|70|m}} tall central pylon by 24 cables.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing0"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/18995/fietsbrug-hovenring-eindhoven-gaat-weer-open.html |title=Fietsbrug Hovenring Eindhoven gaat weer open |date=27 June 2012 |publisher=De Ingenieur |accessdate=17 July 2012 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120806011225/http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/18995/fietsbrug-hovenring-eindhoven-gaat-weer-open.html |archivedate=6 August 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire construction is made of steel.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_tw0"/&gt;

===Vibration issues===
The suspension bridge had to be closed almost immediately after delivery due to unexpected vibrations in the cables caused by the wind.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_omrbra1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_tw0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/17926/tuien-fietsbrug-eindhoven-onderzocht.html |title=Tuien fietsbrug Eindhoven onderzocht |date=30 January 2012 |publisher=De Ingenieur |accessdate=17 July 2012 |language=nl |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140117114055/http://www.deingenieur.nl/nl/nieuws/17926/tuien-fietsbrug-eindhoven-onderzocht.html |archivedate=17 January 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation of the problem was undertaken during the next several weeks by professors of [[civil engineering|civil]] and [[mechanical engineering]] from the [[Eindhoven University of Technology]], the [[Delft University of Technology]] and [[professor]] [[Albert Zasso]] of the [[Politecnico di Milano]].&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing1"/&gt;

It was finally determined that the problem was [[vortex|vortices]] of wind forming in the lee of the cables, causing far heavier [[vibration]]s than expected during design. A solution was found by applying additional [[Shock absorber|damper]]s on the cables. Unfortunately this caused an extra delay of a month in the opening of the bridge, since the [[General contractor|contractor]] initially mounted the dampers incorrectly.&lt;ref name="ehv_hovenring_ing0"/&gt;

An important predecessor to the Dutch design is the cycle [[overpass]] roundabout of [[Tjensvollkrysset]] in [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]]. Opened in 2010, it bears remarkable resemblance to the Hovenring, sharing for instance its 72m diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bicycledutch.wordpress.com/2012/08/23/spectacular-new-floating-cycle-roundabout/ |title=Spectacular New Floating Cycle Roundabout &amp;#124; Bicycle Dutch |last=Wagenbuur |first=Mark |date=23 August 2012 |website=http://bicycledutch.wordpress.com |publisher=BICYCLE DUTCH |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction is out of concrete rather than steel, and support is more conventional. Considering the Eindhoven ring was designed from 2008 onwards, the designs may very well have been conceived independently of each other.

[[File:Claude Monet, Impression, soleil levant.jpg|thumb|upright=1.55|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Impression, soleil levant]]'' (''Impression, Sunrise''), 1872, oil on canvas, [[Musée Marmottan Monet]], [[Paris]]. This painting became the source of the movement's name, after [[Louis Leroy]]'s article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'' satirically implied that the painting was at most, a sketch.]]
'''Impressionism''' is a 19th-century [[art movement]] characterized by relatively small, thin, yet visible brush strokes, open [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]], emphasis on accurate depiction of light in its changing qualities (often accentuating the effects of the passage of time), ordinary subject matter, inclusion of ''movement'' as a crucial element of human perception and experience, and unusual visual angles. Impressionism originated with a group of Paris-based artists whose independent [[art exhibition|exhibitions]] brought them to prominence during the 1870s and 1880s.

The Impressionists faced harsh opposition from the conventional art community in France. The name of the style derives from the title of a [[Claude Monet]] work, ''Impression, soleil levant'' (''[[Impression, Sunrise]]''), which provoked the critic [[Louis Leroy]] to [[word coinage|coin]] the term in a [[satire|satirical]] review published in the Parisian newspaper ''[[Le Charivari]]''.

The development of Impressionism in the [[visual arts]] was soon followed by analogous styles in other media that became known as [[impressionist music]] and [[Impressionism (literature)|impressionist literature]].

==Overview==
[[File:The Fighting Temeraire, JMW Turner, National Gallery.jpg|thumb|[[J. M. W. Turner]]'s atmospheric work was influential on the birth of Impressionism, here ''[[The Fighting Temeraire]]'' (1839)]]

Radicals in their time, early Impressionists violated the rules of academic painting. They constructed their pictures from freely brushed colours that took precedence over lines and contours, following the example of painters such as [[Eugène Delacroix]] and [[J. M. W. Turner]]. They also painted realistic scenes of modern life, and often painted outdoors. Previously, [[still life]]s and [[portrait]]s as well as [[landscape art|landscapes]] were usually painted in a studio.&lt;ref&gt;Exceptions include [[Canaletto#Outdoor painting|Canaletto]], who painted outside and may have used the [[camera obscura]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Impressionists found that they could capture the momentary and transient effects of sunlight by painting outdoors or ''[[en plein air]]''. They portrayed overall visual effects instead of details, and used short "broken" brush strokes of mixed and pure unmixed colour—not blended smoothly or shaded, as was customary—to achieve an effect of intense colour vibration.

[[File:Pierre-Auguste Renoir, Le Moulin de la Galette.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], ''Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette ([[Bal du moulin de la Galette]])'', 1876, [[Musée d'Orsay]], one of Impressionism's most celebrated masterpieces.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.fr/books?id=AXdOAAAAYAAJ Ingo F. Walther, ''Masterpieces of Western Art: A History of Art in 900 Individual Studies from the Gothic to the Present Day, Part 1''], Centralibros Hispania Edicion y Distribucion, S.A., 1999, {{ISBN|3822870315}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Impressionism emerged in France at the same time that a number of other painters, including the Italian artists known as the [[Macchiaioli]], and [[Winslow Homer]] in the United States, were also exploring ''plein-air'' painting. The Impressionists, however, developed new techniques specific to the style. Encompassing what its adherents argued was a different way of seeing, it is an art of immediacy and movement, of candid poses and compositions, of the play of light expressed in a bright and varied use of colour.

The public, at first hostile, gradually came to believe that the Impressionists had captured a fresh and original vision, even if the art critics and art establishment disapproved of the new style.  By recreating the sensation in the eye that views the subject, rather than delineating the details of the subject, and by creating a welter of techniques and forms, Impressionism is a precursor of various painting styles, including [[Neo-Impressionism]], [[Post-Impressionism]], [[Fauvism]], and [[Cubism]].

==Beginnings==
In the middle of the 19th century—a time of change, as Emperor [[Napoleon III]] rebuilt Paris and waged war—the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] dominated French art. The Académie was the preserver of traditional French painting standards of content and style. Historical subjects, religious themes, and portraits were valued; landscape and still life were not. The Académie preferred carefully finished images that looked realistic when examined closely. Paintings in this style were made up of precise brush strokes carefully blended to hide the artist's hand in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Nathalia Brodskaya, Impressionism, Parkstone International, 2014, pp. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt; Colour was restrained and often toned down further by the application of a golden varnish.&lt;ref name="The Met"&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/imml/hd_imml.htm Samu, Margaret. "Impressionism: Art and Modernity". In Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2000 (October 2004)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Académie had an annual, juried art show, the [[Salon de Paris]], and artists whose work was displayed in the show won prizes, garnered commissions, and enhanced their prestige. The standards of the juries represented the values of the Académie, represented by the works of such artists as [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Alexandre Cabanel]].

In the early 1860s, four young painters—[[Claude Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], [[Alfred Sisley]], and [[Frédéric Bazille]]—met while studying under the academic artist [[Marc-Charles-Gabriel Gleyre|Charles Gleyre]]. They discovered that they shared an interest in painting landscape and contemporary life rather than historical or mythological scenes. Following a practice that had become increasingly popular by mid-century, they often ventured into the countryside together to paint in the open air,&lt;ref&gt;White, Harrison C., Cynthia A. White (1993). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=2D_ehhO_14QC&amp;pg=PA116 Canvases and Careers: Institutional Change in the French Painting World]''. University of Chicago Press. p. 116. {{ISBN|0226894878}}.&lt;/ref&gt; but not for the purpose of making sketches to be developed into carefully finished works in the studio, as was the usual custom.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 21–27.&lt;/ref&gt; By painting in sunlight directly from nature, and making bold use of the vivid synthetic pigments that had become available since the beginning of the century, they began to develop a lighter and brighter manner of painting that extended further the [[realism (arts)|Realism]] of [[Gustave Courbet]] and the [[Barbizon school]]. A favourite meeting place for the artists was the [[Café Guerbois]] on Avenue de Clichy in Paris, where the discussions were often led by [[Édouard Manet]], whom the younger artists greatly admired. They were soon joined by [[Camille Pissarro]], [[Paul Cézanne]], and [[Armand Guillaumin]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenspan, Taube G. "Armand Guillaumin", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edouard Manet - Luncheon on the Grass - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Édouard Manet]], ''[[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe|The Luncheon on the Grass]]'' (''Le déjeuner sur l'herbe''), 1863]]
During the 1860s, the Salon jury routinely rejected about half of the works submitted by Monet and his friends in favour of works by artists faithful to the approved style.&lt;ref&gt;Seiberling, Grace, "Impressionism", ''Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, the Salon jury rejected Manet's ''The Luncheon on the Grass'' ''([[Le déjeuner sur l'herbe]])'' primarily because it depicted a nude woman with two clothed men at a picnic. While the Salon jury routinely accepted nudes in historical and allegorical paintings, they condemned Manet for placing a realistic nude in a contemporary setting.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.133.&lt;/ref&gt; The jury's severely worded rejection of Manet's painting appalled his admirers, and the unusually large number of rejected works that year perturbed many French artists.

After Emperor Napoleon III saw the rejected works of 1863, he decreed that the public be allowed to judge the work themselves, and the [[Salon des Refusés]] (Salon of the Refused) was organized. While many viewers came only to laugh, the Salon des Refusés drew attention to the existence of a new tendency in art and attracted more visitors than the regular Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Alfred Sisley 001.jpg|thumb|left|[[Alfred Sisley]], ''View of the Saint-Martin Canal, Paris'', 1870, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]
Artists' petitions requesting a new Salon des Refusés in 1867, and again in 1872, were denied. In December 1873, [[Claude Monet|Monet]], [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir|Renoir]], [[Camille Pissarro|Pissarro]], [[Alfred Sisley|Sisley]], [[Paul Cézanne|Cézanne]], [[Berthe Morisot]], [[Edgar Degas]] and several other artists founded the ''Société Anonyme Coopérative des Artistes Peintres, Sculpteurs, Graveurs'' ("Cooperative and Anonymous Association of Painters, Sculptors, and Engravers") to exhibit their artworks independently.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the association were expected to forswear participation in the Salon.&lt;ref&gt;Jensen 1994, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; The organizers invited a number of other progressive artists to join them in their inaugural exhibition, including the older [[Eugène Boudin]], whose example had first persuaded Monet to adopt ''plein air'' painting years before.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.32.&lt;/ref&gt; Another painter who greatly influenced Monet and his friends, [[Johan Jongkind]], declined to participate, as did [[Édouard Manet]]. In total, thirty artists participated in their first exhibition, held in April 1874 at the studio of the photographer [[Nadar (photographer)|Nadar]].

[[File:Claude Monet - Graystaks I.JPG|thumb|left|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Haystacks (Monet)|Haystacks, (sunset)]]'', 1890–1891, [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]]]
The critical response was mixed. Monet and Cézanne received the harshest attacks. Critic and humorist [[Louis Leroy]] wrote a scathing review in the newspaper ''Le Charivari'' in which, making wordplay with the title of Claude Monet's ''[[Impression, Sunrise]]'' ''(Impression, soleil levant)'', he gave the artists the name by which they became known. Derisively titling his article ''[[s:Exhibition of the Impressionists|The Exhibition of the Impressionists]]'', Leroy declared that Monet's painting was at most, a sketch, and could hardly be termed a finished work.

He wrote, in the form of a dialog between viewers,
:''Impression—I was certain of it. I was just telling myself that, since I was impressed, there had to be some impression in it ... and what freedom, what ease of workmanship! Wallpaper in its embryonic state is more finished than that seascape.''&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 323.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Claude Monet - Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Woman with a Parasol - Madame Monet and Her Son]]'' (Camille and Jean Monet), 1875, [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
The term ''Impressionist'' quickly gained favour with the public. It was also accepted by the artists themselves, even though they were a diverse group in style and temperament, unified primarily by their spirit of independence and rebellion. They exhibited together—albeit with shifting membership—eight times between 1874 and 1886. The Impressionists' style, with its loose, spontaneous brushstrokes, would soon become synonymous with modern life.&lt;ref name="The Met" /&gt;

Monet, Sisley, Morisot, and Pissarro may be considered the "purest" Impressionists, in their consistent pursuit of an art of spontaneity, sunlight, and colour. Degas rejected much of this, as he believed in the primacy of drawing over colour and belittled the practice of painting outdoors.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon; Forge (1988), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Renoir turned away from Impressionism for a time during the 1880s, and never entirely regained his commitment to its ideas. Édouard Manet, although regarded by the Impressionists as their leader,&lt;ref&gt;Distel et al. (1974), p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; never abandoned his liberal use of black as a colour (while Impressionists avoided its use and preferred to obtain darker colours by mixing), and never participated in the Impressionist exhibitions. He continued to submit his works to the Salon, where his painting ''Spanish Singer'' had won a 2nd class medal in 1861, and he urged the others to do likewise, arguing that "the Salon is the real field of battle" where a reputation could be made.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson (1976), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Camille Pissarro - Boulevard Montmartre - Eremitage.jpg|thumb|left|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Boulevard Montmartre'', 1897, the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], [[Saint Petersburg]]]]
Among the artists of the core group (minus Bazille, who had died in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870), defections occurred as Cézanne, followed later by Renoir, Sisley, and Monet, abstained from the group exhibitions so they could submit their works to the Salon. Disagreements arose from issues such as Guillaumin's membership in the group, championed by Pissarro and Cézanne against opposition from Monet and Degas, who thought him unworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; Degas invited [[Mary Cassatt]] to display her work in the 1879 exhibition, but also insisted on the inclusion of [[Jean-François Raffaëlli]], [[Ludovic-Napoléon Lepic|Ludovic Lepic]], and other realists who did not represent Impressionist practices, causing Monet in 1880 to accuse the Impressionists of "opening doors to first-come daubers".&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; The group divided over invitations to [[Paul Signac]] and [[Georges Seurat]] to exhibit with them in 1886. Pissarro was the only artist to show at all eight Impressionist exhibitions.

The individual artists achieved few financial rewards from the Impressionist exhibitions, but their art gradually won a degree of public acceptance and support. Their dealer, [[Paul Durand-Ruel|Durand-Ruel]], played a major role in this as he kept their work before the public and arranged shows for them in London and New York. Although Sisley died in poverty in 1899, Renoir had a great Salon success in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Distel, Anne, Michel Hoog, and Charles S. Moffett. 1974. [https://books.google.com/books?id=dhc-U0t14vMC&amp;pg=PA190&amp;dq= ''Impressionism; a Centenary Exhibition, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, December 12, 1974–February 10, 1975'']. [New York]: [Metropolitan Museum of Art]. p. 190. {{ISBN|0870990977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Monet became secure financially during the early 1880s and so did Pissarro by the early 1890s. By this time the methods of Impressionist painting, in a diluted form, had become commonplace in Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p. 475–476.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impressionist techniques==
[[File:Cassatt Mary At the Theater 1879.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mary Cassatt]], ''Lydia Leaning on Her Arms'' (in a theatre box), 1879]]
French painters who prepared the way for Impressionism include the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] colourist [[Eugène Delacroix]], the leader of the realists [[Gustave Courbet]], and painters of the [[Barbizon school]] such as [[Théodore Rousseau]]. The Impressionists learned much from the work of [[Johan Barthold Jongkind]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]] and [[Eugène Boudin]], who painted from nature in a direct and spontaneous style that prefigured Impressionism, and who befriended and advised the younger artists.

A number of identifiable techniques and working habits contributed to the innovative style of the Impressionists. Although these methods had been used by previous artists—and are often conspicuous in the work of artists such as [[Frans Hals]], [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[John Constable]], and [[Joseph Mallord William Turner|J.&amp;nbsp;M.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;Turner]]—the Impressionists were the first to use them all together, and with such consistency. These techniques include:

* Short, thick strokes of paint quickly capture the essence of the subject, rather than its details. The paint is often applied [[impasto]].
* Colours are applied side-by-side with as little mixing as possible, a technique that exploits the principle of [[simultaneous contrast]] to make the colour appear more vivid to the viewer.
* Grays and dark tones are produced by mixing [[complementary colour]]s. Pure impressionism avoids the use of black paint.
* [[Wet-on-wet|Wet paint is placed into wet paint]] without waiting for successive applications to dry, producing softer edges and intermingling of colour.
* Impressionist paintings do not exploit the transparency of thin paint films (glazes), which earlier artists manipulated carefully to produce effects. The impressionist painting surface is typically opaque.
* The paint is applied to a white or light-coloured ground. Previously, painters often used dark grey or strongly coloured grounds. 
* The play of natural light is emphasized. Close attention is paid to the reflection of colours from object to object. Painters often worked in the evening to produce ''[[effets de soir]]''—the shadowy effects of evening or twilight.
* In paintings made ''[[en plein air]]'' (outdoors), shadows are boldly painted with the blue of the sky as it is reflected onto surfaces, giving a sense of freshness previously not represented in painting. (Blue shadows on snow inspired the technique.)

New technology played a role in the development of the style. Impressionists took advantage of the mid-century introduction of premixed paints in tin tubes (resembling modern toothpaste tubes), which allowed artists to work more spontaneously, both outdoors and indoors.&lt;ref&gt;Bomford et al. 1990, pp. 39–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, painters made their own paints individually, by grinding and mixing dry pigment powders with linseed oil, which were then stored in animal bladders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf Renoir and the Impressionist Process] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105173433/http://phillipscollection.org/docs/education/lbp-kit_4.pdf |date=2011-01-05 }}. ''[[The Phillips Collection]]'', retrieved May 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Many vivid synthetic pigments became commercially available to artists for the first time during the 19th century. These included [[cobalt blue]], [[viridian]], [[cadmium yellow]], and synthetic [[ultramarine blue]], all of which were in use by the 1840s, before Impressionism.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"/&gt; The Impressionists' manner of painting made bold use of these pigments, and of even newer colours such as [[cerulean blue]],&lt;ref name="The Met"/&gt; which became commercially available to artists in the 1860s.&lt;ref name="Wallert_159"&gt;Wallert, Arie; Hermens, Erma; Peek, Marja (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=pdFOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq= ''Historical painting techniques, materials, and studio practice: preprints of a symposium, University of Leiden, Netherlands, 26-29 June, 1995'']. [Marina Del Rey, Calif.]: Getty Conservation Institute. p. 159. {{ISBN|0892363223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Impressionists' progress toward a brighter style of painting was gradual. During the 1860s, Monet and Renoir sometimes painted on canvases prepared with the traditional red-brown or grey ground.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012).

London: Routledge. p. 177]. {{ISBN|1136000410}}.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, Monet, Renoir, and Pissarro usually chose to paint on grounds of a lighter grey or beige colour, which functioned as a middle tone in the finished painting.&lt;ref name="Hill_177"/&gt; By the 1880s, some of the Impressionists had come to prefer white or slightly off-white grounds, and no longer allowed the ground colour a significant role in the finished painting.&lt;ref&gt;Stoner, Joyce Hill; Rushfield, Rebecca Anne (2012).

Prior to the Impressionists, other painters, notably such [[Dutch Golden Age painting|17th-century Dutch painters]] as [[Jan Steen]], had emphasized common subjects, but their methods of [[composition (visual arts)|composition]] were traditional. They arranged their compositions so that the main subject commanded the viewer's attention. The Impressionists relaxed the boundary between subject and background so that the effect of an Impressionist painting often resembles a snapshot, a part of a larger reality captured as if by chance.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenblum (1989), p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Photography]] was gaining popularity, and as cameras became more portable, photographs became more candid. Photography inspired Impressionists to represent momentary action, not only in the fleeting lights of a landscape, but in the day-to-day lives of people.&lt;ref&gt;Varnedoe, J. Kirk T.

The development of Impressionism can be considered partly as a reaction by artists to the challenge presented by photography, which seemed to devalue the artist's skill in reproducing reality. Both portrait and [[Landscape art|landscape]] paintings were deemed somewhat deficient and lacking in truth as photography "produced lifelike images much more efficiently and reliably".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt;

In spite of this, photography actually inspired artists to pursue other means of creative expression, and rather than compete with photography to emulate reality, artists focused "on the one thing they could inevitably do better than the photograph—by further developing into an art form its very subjectivity in the conception of the image, the very subjectivity that photography eliminated".&lt;ref name = "impressionism757"/&gt; The Impressionists sought to express their perceptions of nature, rather than create exact representations. This allowed artists to depict subjectively what they saw with their "tacit imperatives of taste and conscience".&lt;ref name="impressionism758"&gt;Sontag, Susan (1977) On Photography, Penguin, London&lt;/ref&gt; Photography encouraged painters to exploit aspects of the painting medium, like colour, which photography then lacked: "The Impressionists were the first to consciously offer a subjective alternative to the photograph".&lt;ref name="impressionism757"&gt;Levinson, Paul (1997) ''The Soft Edge; a Natural History and Future of the Information Revolution'', Routledge, London and New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major influence was Japanese [[ukiyo-e]] art prints ([[Japonism]]). The art of these prints contributed significantly to the "snapshot" angles and unconventional compositions that became characteristic of Impressionism. An example is Monet's ''Jardin à Sainte-Adresse'', 1867, with its bold blocks of colour and composition on a strong diagonal slant showing the influence of Japanese prints&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kLEpf5a49V0C&amp;pg=PA433&amp;dq=Terrasse+%C3%A0+Sainte-Adresse+japanese+prints&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dwnPUtm_GKnNsQTV-4KIDA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Terrasse%20%C3%A0%20Sainte-Adresse%20japanese%20prints&amp;f=false Gary Tinterow, Origins of Impressionism, Metropolitan Museum of Art,1994, page 433]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edgar Degas]] was both an avid photographer and a collector of Japanese prints.&lt;ref&gt;Baumann; Karabelnik, et al. (1994), p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''The Dance Class'' ''(La classe de danse)'' of 1874 shows both influences in its asymmetrical composition. The dancers are seemingly caught off guard in various awkward poses, leaving an expanse of empty floor space in the lower right quadrant. He also captured his dancers in sculpture, such as the ''[[Little Dancer of Fourteen Years]]''.

==Associates and influenced artists==
[[File:James Abbot McNeill Whistler 012.jpg|thumb|upright|[[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]], ''[[Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket]]'', 1874, [[Detroit Institute of Arts]]]]
Among the close associates of the Impressionists were several painters who adopted their methods to some degree. These include [[Jean-Louis Forain]] (who participated in Impressionist exhibitions in 1879, 1880, 1881 and 1886)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.culture.gouv.fr/documentation/joconde/fr/decouvrir/expositions/impressionnisme/theme_imprart.htm|title=Joconde : catalogue collectif des collections des musées de France|website=www.culture.gouv.fr|access-date=2017-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Giuseppe De Nittis]], an Italian artist living in Paris who participated in the first Impressionist exhibit at the invitation of Degas, although the other Impressionists disparaged his work.&lt;ref&gt;Denvir (1990), p.152.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Federico Zandomeneghi]] was another Italian friend of Degas who showed with the Impressionists. [[Eva Gonzalès]] was a follower of Manet who did not exhibit with the group. [[James Abbott McNeill Whistler]] was an American-born painter who played a part in Impressionism although he did not join the group and preferred grayed colours. [[Walter Sickert]], an English artist, was initially a follower of Whistler, and later an important disciple of Degas; he did not exhibit with the Impressionists. In 1904 the artist and writer [[Wynford Dewhurst]] wrote the first important study of the French painters published in English, ''Impressionist Painting: its genesis and development'', which did much to popularize Impressionism in Great Britain.

By the early 1880s, Impressionist methods were affecting, at least superficially, the art of the Salon. Fashionable painters such as [[Jean Béraud]] and [[Henri Gervex]] found critical and financial success by brightening their palettes while retaining the smooth finish expected of Salon art.&lt;ref&gt;Rewald (1973), p.476–477.&lt;/ref&gt; Works by these artists are sometimes casually referred to as Impressionism, despite their remoteness from Impressionist practice.

The influence of the French Impressionists lasted long after most of them had died. Artists like [[Jesekiel David Kirszenbaum|J.D. Kirszenbaum]] were borrowing Impressionist techniques throughout the twentieth century.

==Beyond France==
[[File:Serov devochka s persikami.jpg|thumb|''[[Girl with Peaches|The Girl with Peaches]]'' (1887, [[Tretyakov Gallery]]) by [[Valentin Serov]]]]
[[File:Arthur Streeton - Golden summer, Eaglemont - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Streeton]]'s 1889 landscape ''[[Golden Summer, Eaglemont]]'', held at the [[National Gallery of Australia]], is an example of [[Heidelberg School|Australian impressionism]].]]
[[File:Hipp hipp hurra! Konstnärsfest på Skagen - Peder Severin Krøyer.jpg|thumb|[[Peder Severin Krøyer]]'s 1888 work ''[[Hip, Hip, Hurrah!]]'', held at the [[Gothenburg Museum of Art]], shows members of the [[Skagen Painters]].]]

As the influence of Impressionism spread beyond France, artists, too numerous to list, became identified as practitioners of the new style. Some of the more important examples are:
* The [[American Impressionism|American Impressionists]], including [[Mary Cassatt]], [[William Merritt Chase]], [[Frederick Carl Frieseke]], [[Childe Hassam]], [[Willard Metcalf]], [[Lilla Cabot Perry]], [[Theodore Robinson]], [[Edmund C. Tarbell|Edmund Charles Tarbell]], [[John Henry Twachtman]], [[Catherine Wiley]] and [[J. Alden Weir]].
* The [[Australian Impressionism|Australian Impressionists]], including [[Tom Roberts]], [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Walter Withers]], [[Charles Conder]] and [[Frederick McCubbin]] (who were prominent members of the [[Heidelberg School]]), and [[John Peter Russell]], a friend of Van Gogh, Rodin, Monet and Matisse.
* The [[Amsterdam Impressionism|Amsterdam Impressionists]] in the [[Netherlands]], including [[George Hendrik Breitner]], [[Isaac Israëls]], [[Willem Bastiaan Tholen]], [[Willem de Zwart]], [[Willem Witsen]] and [[Jan Toorop]].
* [[Anna Boch]], Vincent van Gogh's friend [[Eugène Boch]], [[Georges Lemmen]] and [[Théo van Rysselberghe]], Impressionist painters from [[Belgium]].
* [[Ivan Grohar]], [[Rihard Jakopič]], [[Matija Jama]], and [[Matej Sternen]], Impressionists from Slovenia. Their beginning was in the school of [[Anton Ažbe]] in Munich and they were influenced by [[Jurij Šubic]] and [[Ivana Kobilca]], Slovenian painters working in Paris
* [[Wynford Dewhurst]], [[Walter Richard Sickert]], and [[Philip Wilson Steer]] were well known Impressionist painters from the [[United Kingdom]]. [[Pierre Adolphe Valette]], who was born in France but who worked in Manchester, was the tutor of [[L. S. Lowry]].
* The [[German Impressionism|German Impressionists]], including [[Lovis Corinth]], [[Max Liebermann]], [[Ernst Oppler]], [[Max Slevogt]] and [[August von Brandis]].
* [[László Mednyánszky]] in Hungary
* [[Theodor von Ehrmanns]] and [[Hugo Charlemont]] who were rare Impressionists among the more dominant [[Vienna Secessionist]] painters in Austria
* [[William John Leech]], [[Roderic O'Conor]], and [[Walter Osborne]] in Ireland
* [[Konstantin Korovin]] and [[Valentin Serov]] in Russia
* [[Francisco Oller|Francisco Oller y Cestero]], a native of [[Puerto Rico]] and a friend of Pissarro and Cézanne
* [[James Nairn]] in [[New Zealand]].
* [[William McTaggart]] in [[Scotland]].
* [[Laura Muntz Lyall]], a [[Canadians|Canadian]] artist
* [[Władysław Podkowiński]], a [[Poland|Polish]] Impressionist and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolist]]
* [[Nicolae Grigorescu]] in [[Romania]]
* [[Nazmi Ziya Güran]], who brought Impressionism to [[Turkey]]
* [[Chafik Charobim]] in [[Egypt]]
* [[Eliseu Visconti]] in [[Brazil]]
* [[Joaquín Sorolla]] in Spain
* Faustino Brughetti, [[Fernando Fader]], [[Candido Lopez]], [[Martín Malharro]], Walter de Navazio, [[Ramón Silva]] in Argentina
* [[Skagen Painters]] a group of Scandinavian artists who painted in a small Danish fishing village
* [[Nadežda Petrović]] in [[Serbia]]
* [[Ásgrímur Jónsson]] in [[Iceland]]
* [[Fujishima Takeji]] in [[Japan]]
* [[Frits Thaulow]] in [[Norway]] and later France.

==Sculpture, photography and film==
The sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]] is sometimes called an Impressionist for the way he used roughly modeled surfaces to suggest transient light effects.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, Fred S., and Helen Gardner (2014). ''Gardner's art through the ages: a concise Western history''. Boston, MA: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning. p. 382. {{ISBN|9781133954798}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pictorialism|Pictorialist]] photographers whose work is characterized by soft focus and atmospheric effects have also been called Impressionists.

[[French Impressionist Cinema]] is a term applied to a loosely defined group of films and filmmakers in France from 1919–1929, although these years are debatable. French Impressionist filmmakers include [[Abel Gance]], [[Jean Epstein]], [[Germaine Dulac]], Marcel L’Herbier, [[Louis Delluc]], and Dmitry Kirsanoff.

==Music and literature==
{{Main|Impressionist music|Impressionism (literature)}}
[[File:Monet Water Lilies 1916.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Water Lilies]],'' 1916, [[The National Museum of Western Art]], Tokyo]]
Musical Impressionism is the name given to a movement in [[European classical music]] that arose in the late 19th century and continued into the middle of the 20th century. Originating in France, musical Impressionism is characterized by suggestion and atmosphere, and eschews the emotional excesses of the [[Romantic music|Romantic era]]. Impressionist composers favoured short forms such as the [[nocturne]], [[Arabesque (classical music)|arabesque]], and [[Prelude (music)|prelude]], and often explored uncommon scales such as the [[whole tone scale]]. Perhaps the most notable innovations of Impressionist composers were the introduction of major 7th chords and the extension of chord structures in 3rds to five- and six-part harmonies.

The influence of visual Impressionism on its musical counterpart is debatable. [[Claude Debussy]] and [[Maurice Ravel]] are generally considered the greatest Impressionist composers, but Debussy disavowed the term, calling it the invention of critics. [[Erik Satie]] was also considered in this category, though his approach was regarded as less serious, more musical novelty in nature. [[Paul Dukas]] is another French composer sometimes considered an Impressionist, but his style is perhaps more closely aligned to the late Romanticists. Musical Impressionism beyond France includes the work of such composers as [[Ottorino Respighi]] (Italy) [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]], [[Cyril Scott]], and [[John Ireland (composer)|John Ireland]] (England), and [[Manuel De Falla]], and [[Isaac Albeniz]] (Spain).

The term Impressionism has also been used to describe works of literature in which a few select details suffice to convey the sensory impressions of an incident or scene. Impressionist literature is closely related to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], with its major exemplars being [[Charles Baudelaire|Baudelaire]], [[Stéphane Mallarmé|Mallarmé]], [[Arthur Rimbaud|Rimbaud]], and [[Paul Verlaine|Verlaine]]. Authors such as [[Virginia Woolf]], [[D.H. Lawrence]], and [[Joseph Conrad]] have written works that are Impressionistic in the way that they describe, rather than interpret, the impressions, sensations and emotions that constitute a character's mental life.

[[File:Camille Pissarro 019.jpg|thumb|[[Camille Pissarro]], ''Children on a Farm'', 1887]]

==Post-Impressionism==
{{Main|Post-Impressionism}}
Post-Impressionism developed from Impressionism. During the 1880s several artists began to develop different precepts for the use of colour, pattern, form, and line, derived from the Impressionist example: [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]], and [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. These artists were slightly younger than the Impressionists, and their work is known as post-Impressionism. Some of the original Impressionist artists also ventured into this new territory; [[Camille Pissarro]] briefly painted in a [[Pointillism|pointillist]] manner, and even Monet abandoned strict ''plein air'' painting. [[Paul Cézanne]], who participated in the first and third Impressionist exhibitions, developed a highly individual vision emphasising pictorial structure, and he is more often called a post-Impressionist. Although these cases illustrate the difficulty of assigning labels, the work of the original Impressionist painters may, by definition, be categorised as Impressionism.

The '''Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvananthapuram''' ('''IISER Thiruvananthapuram''' or '''IISER-TVM''') is one of seven IISERs, institutes established by the [[Ministry of Human Resource Development]], [[Government of India]].

The institute awards five-year integrated [[Master of Science]] degrees in [[Mathematics]], [[Physics]], [[Chemistry]] and [[Biology]]. There are facilities for doing research in those areas leading to the award of PhD.

IISER-TVM is located at the foothills of the [[Ponmudi]] hills of the Western Ghats, about 50&amp;nbsp;km from Thiruvananthapuram.&lt;ref&gt;G Mahadevan, [http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/26/stories/2007102661670400.htm ''Centre hailed for sanctioning IISER''], ''[[The Hindu]]'' dated 26 October 2007 (Retrieved on 18 February 209)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008101653270700.htm&amp;date=2008/10/16/&amp;prd=th&amp; ''Land for IISER at Vithura''], ''[[The Hindu]]'' dated 16 October 2008 (Retrieved on 18 February)&lt;/ref&gt; There are six other [[IISER]]s in India, namely [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal|IISER Bhopal]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata|IISER Kolkata]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Mohali|IISER Mohali]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Pune|IISER Pune]], [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Tirupati|IISER Tirupati]] and [[Indian Institute of Science Education and Research Berhampur|IISER Berhampur]].

== Background==
[[Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research]] (IISERs) were created in 2006 through a proclamation of Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India, under the category of [[List of Institutes of National Importance|institutes of national importance]], to promote quality education and research in basic sciences. Soon after the announcement, two of these institutes at [[Pune]] and [[Kolkata]], respectively, were started in 2006. This was followed by an institute at [[Mohali]] (2007) and at [[Bhopal]] and [[Thiruvananthapuram]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Thiruvananthapuram/IISER-starts-functioning-from-Vithura-campus/article14517924.ece|title=IISER starts functioning from Vithura campus|date=31 July 2016|accessdate=1 August 2018|website=Thehindu.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each IISER is a degree granting autonomous institution with a prime focus to integrate science education and research. IISERs are destined to become Science Institutes of the highest caliber and reach the prestigious position in the global setting that [[Indian Institute of Science|IISc]], [[Indian Institutes of Management|IIMs]], [[Indian Institutes of Technology|IITs]] and [[National Institutes of Technology|NITs]]  presently enjoy.

== Administration ==
The institute is administered by a Board of Governors with [[Tessy Thomas]] as Chairperson, a 25-member Senate  and the Director, V. Ramakrishnan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/pages/board_of_governors.phpx|title=Board of Governors - IISER - TVM|website=Iisertvm.ac.in|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iisertvm.ac.in/pages/senate.phpx|title=Senate - IISER - TVM|website=Iisertvm.ac.in|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Deans are M. P. Rajan (Academics), Ramesh Chandra Nath (Students Affairs), Hema Somanathan (Research and Development) and Anil Shaji (Planning and Development).&lt;ref name="iisertvm.ac.in"/&gt;

==Academic Programs==
* '''Integrated Master's (M.S.)''': [[University and college admissions|Admission]] to this program is through the following channels:
# [[Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana]] (KVPY) Basic Science Stream: Students qualifying in SA (2012)/SX (2013)/SB (2013).
# Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced): Students securing a place in the rank list of Joint Entrance Examination (Advanced) for admission to Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs).
# State and Central Boards: Those, who are eligible for INSPIRE scholarship by [[Department of Science and Technology (India)|Department of Science and Technology]] (DST) on the basis of their aggregate scores in class XII may be considered for admission after clearing an aptitude test. Currently done in co-ordination with the other [[IISER]]s through a Joint Admission Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iiseradmission.in/|title=Joint IISER admission portal|last=|first=|date=|website=Iiseradmission.in|publisher=|access-date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first two years of the 5-year program involves coursework in all subjects (Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Biology, Humanities and Interdisciplinary courses). For the next two years, the students choose courses across subjects, as per their liking. The final year is spent on a research project.&lt;ref&gt;G Mahadevan, [http://www.hinduonnet.com/thehindu/thscrip/print.pl?file=2008090851000300.htm&amp;date=2008/09/08/&amp;prd=edu&amp; ''Emphasis on integrated research''], ''[[The Hindu]]'' dated 8 August 2008 (Retrieved on 18 February 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Doctoral Program''' ([[Ph.D.]]): Admission to the doctoral program is after a master's degree in [[science]]. Besides the students of the Integrated Master's program, [[postgraduate]] students with a master's degree in science from other Universities/Institutes will also be admitted to the doctoral program. The program will involve course work, a qualifying examination, a state-of-the-art seminar, [[thesis]] work, open seminar and a thesis [[Test (assessment)|examination]], leading to the award of a PhD degree. The quantum of course work will vary depending on the background of the student. Besides individual research, students will be involved in several [[professional]] activities such as seminars, workshops, presentations and review meetings. All doctoral students will assist faculty members in [[teaching]] during the course of the doctoral program.
* '''Integrated Doctoral Program''' (Int. Ph.D.): Admission to this program is after a B.Sc. degree in any of the [[basic science]]s. Students of this program start their course by attending their class with third year students of Dual Degree B.S.- M.S. course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iiseradmission.in/|title=IISER ADMISSION 2018|website=Iiseradmission.in|accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26187">'''[[Infanticide (zoology)|Infanticide]] in non-human [[primate]]s''' occurs when an individual kills its own or another individual's dependent young. Five hypotheses have been proposed to explain infanticide in non-human primates: [[Exploitation competition|exploitation]], resource [[Competition (biology)|competition]], parental manipulation, [[sexual selection]], and social pathology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Hypotheses for infanticide  ==

=== Exploitation ===
[[File:Cebus albifrons edit3.jpg|thumb|A white fronted capuchin sits in a tree. Cases of infantidice in white fronted capuchins have been attributed to resource competition.]]
Infanticide in non-human primates occurs as a result of exploitation when the individuals enacting the infanticide directly benefit from consumption or use of their victim.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The individual can become a resource: food ([[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalism]]), protective buffer against aggression, or a prop to obtain maternal experience.

The form of exploitation in non-human primates most attributable to adult females is when non-lactating females take an infant from its mother ([[allomothering]]) and forcibly retain it until starvation. This is known as the "aunting to death" phenomena; these non-lactating female primates gain mothering-like experience, yet lack the resources to feed the infant.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Resource Competition ===
Resource competition results when there are too few resources in a particular area to support the existing population. In primates, resource competition is a prime motivator for infanticide. Infanticide motivated by resource competition can occur both outside of and within familial groups. Dominant, high ranking, female chimpanzees have been shown to more often aggress towards a lower ranking female and her infant due to resource competition.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pusey|first=Anne E.|last2=Schroepfer-Walker|first2=Kara|date=2013-12-05|title=Female competition in chimpanzees|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=368|issue=1631|pages=|doi=10.1098/rstb.2013.0077|issn=0962-8436|pmc=3826206|pmid=24167307}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primates from outside of familial groups might infiltrate areas and kill infants from other groups to eliminate [[Competition (biology)|competition]] for resources. When resources are limited, infants are  easier to eliminate from the competition pool than other group members because they are the most defenseless and thus become targets of infanticide. Primate infanticide motivated by resource competition can also involve [[Cannibalism (zoology)|cannibalizing]] the infant as a source of nutrition.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrdy|first=Sarah|year=1979|title=Infanticide among animals: A review, classification, and examination of the implications for the reproductive strategies of females|url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/0162-3095(79)90004-9/abstract|journal=Evolution &amp; Human Behavior|volume=1|pages=13–40|via=|doi=10.1016/0162-3095(79)90004-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resource competition is also a primary motivator in inter-species infanticide, or the killing of infants from one species by another species. Through eliminating infants of another species in the same environment, the probability that the aggressor and their own infants will obtain more resources increases. This behavior has been an observed consequence of multiple primate inter-species conflicts. In these cases, instances of direct aggression toward inter-specific infants in addition to infanticide have also been observed. In these instances of direct aggression, the aggressor was the previous target of intra-species aggression directed towards them. Therefore, the direct aggression and infanticide carried out by these aggressors could be attributed to re-directed aggression.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimbach|first=Rebecca|last2=Pardo-Martinez|first2=Alejandra|last3=Montes-Rojas|first3=Andres|last4=Di Fiore|first4=Anthony|last5=Link|first5=Andres|date=2012-11-01|title=Interspecific Infanticide and Infant-Directed Aggression by Spider Monkeys (Ateles hybridus) in a Fragmented Forest in Colombia|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajp.22052/abstract|journal=American Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=74|issue=11|pages=990–997|doi=10.1002/ajp.22052|issn=1098-2345|pmc=3470929|pmid=22767357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Parental Manipulation ===

==== Maternal Infanticide ====
Maternal Infanticide, the killing of dependent young by the mother, is rare in non-human primates and has been reported only a handful of times. Maternal infanticide has been reported once in brown mantled tamarins, ''[[Brown-mantled tamarin|Saguinus fuscicollis]],'' once in black fronted titis, ''[[Black-fronted titi|Callicebus nigrifrons]],'' and four times in mustached tamarins, ''[[Moustached tamarin|Saguinus mystax]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Culot|first=Laurence|last2=Lledo-Ferrer|first2=Yvan|last3=Hoelscher|first3=Oda|last4=Lazo|first4=Fernando J. J. Muñoz|last5=Huynen|first5=Marie-Claude|last6=Heymann|first6=Eckhard W.|date=2011-02-17|year=|title=Reproductive failure, possible maternal infanticide, and cannibalism in wild moustached tamarins, Saguinus mystax|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-011-0238-6|journal=Primates|language=en|volume=52|issue=2|pages=179–186|doi=10.1007/s10329-011-0238-6|issn=0032-8332|pmc=3068257|pmid=21328068|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is proposed that maternal infanticide occurs when the mother assesses the probability for infant survival based on previous infant deaths.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; If it is unlikely that the infant will survive, infanticide may occur. This may allow the mother to invest more in her current offspring or future offspring, leading to a greater net reproductive fitness in the mother.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

[[File:Callicebus nigrifrons Minas Gerais.jpg|thumb|''Callicebus nigrifrons'' perched in the trees. Maternal infanticide due to resource competition has been reported in ''C. nigifrons.'']]

In the instances of maternal infanticide in tamarins, there were multiple breeding females.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The parental manipulation hypothesis proposes that maternal infanticide occurs more frequently when the group has a poor capacity to raise offspring, multiple breeding females, birth intervals shorter than three months, and low infant survival probability.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Maternal infanticide differs from other varieties of infanticide in that the resource competition and sexual selection hypotheses (see other sections) must be rejected.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Resource competition and sexual selection are ruled out because it is the mother that is performing the infanticide, not another female.

In one case of maternal infanticide in wild black-fronted titi monkeys (''[[Black-fronted titi|Callicebus nigrifrons]]''), the observed deceased infant was clinically healthy with no signs of health abnormalities. Therefore, infanticide did not appear to occur due to low viability of infant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cäsar|first=Cristiane|last2=Franco|first2=Eduardo Silva|last3=Soares|first3=Gabriela de Castro Nogueira|last4=Young|first4=Robert John|date=2008-04-01|title=Observed case of maternal infanticide in a wild group of black-fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons)|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10329-007-0067-9|journal=Primates|language=en|volume=49|issue=2|pages=143–145|doi=10.1007/s10329-007-0067-9|issn=0032-8332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, overcrowding or feeding competition were not factors in infanticide. In this case, there were no clear functions of the infanticide; the reason for infanticide in black-fronted titi monkeys is currently unknown.

=== Sexual Selection ===

==== Sexual Competition ====
Infanticide increases a male's reproductive success when he takes over a new troop of females. This behavior has been observed in [[Colobinae|langurs]] who live in single male breeding groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hrdy|first=S.

Infanticide by females other than the mother have been observed in wild groups of [[common marmoset]]s (''[[Common marmoset|Callithrix jacchus]]'').&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4419-0293-1_7|title=The Smallest Anthropoids|last=Digby|first=Leslie|last2=Saltzman|first2=Wendy|date=2009-01-01|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9781441902924|editor-last=Ford|editor-first=Susan M.|series=Developments in Primatology: Progress and Prospects|pages=135–153|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4419-0293-1_7|editor-last2=Porter|editor-first2=Leila M.|editor-last3=Davis|editor-first3=Lesa C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most cases of such behavior have been attributed to the resource competition hypothesis, in which females can gain more access to resources for herself and for her young by killing unrelated infants. Although commonly used in the context of food or shelter, the resource competition model can be applied to other limited resources, such as breeding opportunities or access to helpers. Most callitrichids have restrictive breeding patterns, which would be compatible with the model, but this infanticide behavior has only been documented in wild groups of common marmosets and not in wild groups of other callitrichid species. The higher frequency in common marmosets may be due to a variety of social, reproductive, and ecological characteristics - including higher likelihood for overlapping pregnancies and births (due to short intervals between births), habitat saturation, and lower costs of infant care compared to other callitrichids - that increase the chance of two breeding females inhabiting the same group, leading to more intense competition. In most observed cases in common marmosets, the socially dominant breeding females killed the infants of a subordinate female, allowing them to maintain their dominance.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Paternal Infanticide ====
Paternal infanticide is rarely observed in non-human primates. In an extensive study of wild Japanese macaques which tracked instances of infanticide, DNA analysis revealed that males would not attack their own offspring or offspring of a female with whom they mated. Further, females in the study were found to be motivated to form social bonds with males in order to protect them from infanticide.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Social Pathology: Role of Social Organization ===
In mammals, interaction between the sexes is usually limited to the female [[Estrous cycle|estrous]] or copulation. However, in non-human primates, these male-female bonds persist past the estrous. Social relationships between males and females in primates are hypothesized to serve as protection against male infanticide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Palombit|first=Ryne A.|date=1999-01-01|title=Infanticide and the evolution of pair bonds in nonhuman primates|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1999)7:43.0.CO;2-O/abstract|journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews|language=en|volume=7|issue=4|pages=117–129|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6505(1999)7:43.0.CO;2-O|issn=1520-6505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Year-round association serves to lower the probability of infanticide by other males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van Schaik|first=C P|last2=Kappeler|first2=P M|date=1997-11-22|year=|title=Infanticide risk and the evolution of male-female association in primates.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=264|issue=1388|pages=1687–1694|doi=10.1098/rspb.1997.0234|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1688726|pmid=9404030|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, many primates live in multi-female groups, and it has been proposed that these females live together to reduce the risk of infanticide through paternity confusion or [[concealed ovulation]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kappeler|first=Peter M.|last2=Schaik|first2=Carel P. van|title=Evolution of Primate Social Systems|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1015520830318|journal=International Journal of Primatology|language=en|volume=23|issue=4|pages=707–740|doi=10.1023/A:1015520830318|issn=0164-0291}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, complex interactions can arise when females have different social rankings and when resource availability is threatened. Most often, dominant females opportunistically kill the young of a less dominant female when competition arises.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Adaptive Counter Adaptations to Infanticide ==

Many primate species have developed counter adaptations to reduce the likelihood of infanticide. These strategies include physical defense, paternity confusion, reproduction suppression, and accelerated development.

=== Physical Defense ===

The most immediate and obvious form of protection against infanticide is physical defense wherein mothers either directly prevent aggressive acts toward their offspring or recruit other individuals for assistance. Female primates have been observed to actively defend territory from potentially infanticidal females, as seen in [[chimpanzee]]s.&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agrell|first1=Jep|last2=Wolff|first2=Jerry O.|last3=Ylönen|first3=Hannu|title=Counter-Strategies to Infanticide in Mammals: Costs and Consequences|journal=Oikos|date=1 January 1998|volume=83|issue=3|pages=507–517|doi=10.2307/3546678|jstor=3546678}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reruit the non-parental assistance in defense, female [[chacma baboon]]s utilize "friendships" with males, wherein the male forms a bond with the infant until weaning, that may serve to protect their offspring from aggression by higher ranking males or females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Seyfarth|first2=Robert M|last3=Cheney|first3=Dorothy L|date=September 1997|title=The adaptive value of ‘friendships’ to female baboons: experimental and observational evidence|url=|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=54|issue=3|pages=599–614|doi=10.1006/anbe.1996.0457|last1=Palombit|first1=Ryne A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hanuman Langur feeding child by N. A. Naseer.jpg|thumb|A Hanuman langur mother feeding an infant. Female Hanuman langurs are known to utilize paternity confusion through concealed ovulation.]]

To protect their young from infanticide, many species of primate mothers will form [[Social monogamy|social monogamous pairs]] to prevent paternal infanticide. In these pairs, the males will mate with other females but live exclusively with one female as a socially monogamous pair. Forming this socially monogamous pair causes the males to form parental relationships and social bonds with the female's offspring. These bonds motivate males to defend their offspring against infanticide from unrelated individuals and to never commit infanticide against their own offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Opie|first=Christopher|last2=Atkinson|first2=Quentin D.|last3=Dunbar|first3=Robin I.

P.|last2=Dunbar|first2=R. I. M.|title=The Evolution of Monogamy in Large Primates: A New Hypothesis and Some Crucial Tests|journal=Behaviour|date=1 January 1990|volume=115|issue=1/2|pages=30–62|jstor=4534885}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt;

One study demonstrated that for [[gorillas]], living in [[Harem (zoology)|harem]]-style groups reduces a female’s risk of infanticide more than if she mated with multiple males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harcourt|first1=A.H.|last2=Greenberg|first2=J.|title=Do gorilla females join males to avoid infanticide? A quantitative model|journal=Animal Behaviour|date=November 2001|volume=62|issue=5|pages=905–915|doi=10.1006/anbe.2001.1835}}&lt;/ref&gt; A female gorilla benefits more from protection by the silverback male, despite the fact that mating with only one male increased paternity certainty and thus increases the number of males in the population that would benefit reproductively from infanticide. However, it is likely that antipredation is also a closely linked motivation to the formation of gorilla social units.

=== Paternity Confusion ===

Females utilize paternity confusion to reduce the likelihood that a male she has mated with will kill her offspring. There are several ways this is accomplished including [[concealed ovulation]]. Female [[Catarrhini|catarrhine]] primates such as [[Gray langur|Hanuman langurs]] have evolved an extended estrous state with variable ovulation in order to conceal the paternity of the fertilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hestermann|first1=M.|last2=Ziegler|first2=T.|last3=van Schaik|first3=C. P.|last4=Launhardt|first4=K.|last5=Winkler|first5=P.|last6=Hodges|first6=J. K.|title=Loss of oestrus, concealed ovulation and paternity confusion in free-ranging Hanuman langurs|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 December 2001|volume=268|issue=1484|pages=2445–2451|doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1833|pmc=1088898}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important situation in which paternity confusion can arise is when females mate with multiple males; this includes mating patterns such as [[Polyandry in nature|polyandry]] and promiscuity in multi-male multi-female groups.&lt;ref name="Harvard University Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clarke|first1=P.|last2=Pradhan|first2=G.|last3=van Schaik|first3=C.|title=Sexual Coercion in Primates and Humans: An Evolutionary Perspective on Male Aggression Against Females|date=2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|pages=42–77|accessdate=|chapter=Intersexual Conflict in Primates: Infanticide, Paternity Allocation, and the Role of Coercion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to promiscuous mating, female primates are [[Proceptive phase|proceptive]] during the first and second trimester of pregnancy in order to increase paternity confusion of their offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Hodges|first2=J. Keith|last3=Heistermann|first3=Michael|date=|title=Post-conception mating in wild long-tailed macaques (Macaca fascicularis): Characterization, endocrine correlates and functional significance|url=|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=51|issue=1|pages=3–10|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.06.009|last1=Engelhardt|first1=Antje}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in multi-male multi-female groups, female synchrony, in which females are all fertile at the same time, can prohibit the dominant male from monopolizing all of the females. This also allows sneak copulations in which non-dominant males sire offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Henzi|first1=S. P.|last2=Clarke|first2=P. M. R.|last3=van Schaik|first3=C. P.|last4=Pradhan|first4=G. R.|last5=Barrett|first5=L.|title=Infanticide and reproductive restraint in a polygynous social mammal|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=11 January 2010|volume=107|issue=5|pages=2130–2135|doi=10.1073/pnas.0913294107}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female synchrony also serves to reduce risk of female infanticide by forcing potentially infanticidal females to focus on provisioning their own infants rather than acting aggressively. But there is some evidence to suggest that female synchrony serves to increase competition pressures and thus aggression in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrell, J., Wolff, J, &amp;Ylonen, H.|first=|year=1998|title=Counter-Strategies to Infanticide in Mammals: Costs and Consequences|jstor=3546678|journal=Oikos|volume=83|pages=507–517}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reproduction Suppression ===

Females may also avoid the costs of continued reproductive investment when infanticide is likely. One such occurrence is known as the Bruce Effect, in which female primates may abort the pregnancy when presented with a new male. This has been observed in wild [[gelada]]s, where a majority of females abort pregnancies following the displacement of a dominant male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Eila K.|last2=Lu|first2=Amy|last3=Bergman|first3=Thore J.|last4=Beehner|first4=Jacinta C.|date=2012-03-09|title=A Bruce Effect in Wild Geladas|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/335/6073/1222|journal=Science|language=en|volume=335|issue=6073|pages=1222–1225|doi=10.1126/science.1213600|issn=0036-8075|pmid=22362878}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Feticide]] is a related but distinct phenomenon by which physical or psychological trauma mediated by male behavior results in fetal loss. For example, in baboons at [[Amboseli Baboon Research Project|Amboseli]], rates of fetal loss increase following the immigration of aggressive males.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zipple|first=Matthew N.|last2=Grady|first2=Jackson H.|last3=Gordon|first3=Jacob B.|last4=Chow|first4=Lydia D.|last5=Archie|first5=Elizabeth A.|last6=Altmann|first6=Jeanne|last7=Alberts|first7=Susan C.|date=2017-01-25|title=Conditional fetal and infant killing by male baboons|url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/284/1847/20162561|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|language=en|volume=284|issue=1847|pages=20162561|doi=10.1098/rspb.2016.2561|issn=0962-8452|pmc=5310045|pmid=28100822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some social systems, lower-ranking primate females may delay reproduction to avoid infanticide by dominant females, as seen in common [[marmosets]]. In one instance, the dominant marmoset female killed the offspring of a subordinate female. This phenomenon of reproduction suppression is also well observed in [[tamarins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Digby|first1=Leslie|title=Infant Care, Infanticide, and Female Reproductive Strategies in Polygynous Groups of Common Marmosets (Callithrix jacchus)|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|date=1 January 1995|volume=37|issue=1|pages=51–61|jstor=4601105}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Accelerated Development ===

In order to reduce the amount of time that infants are particularly vulnerable to infanticide, females have been shown to wean infants earlier when risk of infanticide is high.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhao, Borries, Pan|first=Qing, Carola, Wenshi|year=2011|title=Male takeover, infanticide, and female countertactics in white-headed leaf monkeys (Trachypithecus leucocephalus)|jstor=41414614|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|volume=65|pages=1535–1547}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, female white-headed leaf monkeys were observed to wean their infants significantly more quickly during male takeovers as compared to socially stable periods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Females with infants too young to be weaned left with the old males and returned after their offspring had fully weaned, again after a significantly shorter weaning period than during stable times.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Logistics engineering''' is a  field of engineering dedicated to the scientific organization of the [[purchase]], [[transport]], storage, [[distribution (business)|distribution]], and [[warehousing]] of materials and finished goods. Logistics engineering is a complex science that considers trade-offs in component/system design, repair capability, training, [[Spare parts management|spares inventory]], demand history, storage and distribution points, transportation methods, etc., to ensure the "thing" is where it's needed, when it's needed, and operating the way it's needed all at an acceptable cost.

==Overview==

[[Logistics]] is generally concerned with [[Cost centre (business)|cost centre]] service activities, but provides [[value (economics)|value]] via improved [[efficiency]] and customer satisfaction. It can quickly lose that value if the customer becomes dissatisfied. The end customer can include another process or work center inside of the manufacturing facility, a [[warehouse]] where items are stocked or the final customer who will use the product. Another approach which has appeared in recent years is the [[supply chain management]]. The supply chain  also looks at an efficient chaining of the supply / purchase and distribution sides of an [[organization]]. While logistics looks at single echelons with the immediate supply and distribution linked up, supply chain looks at multiple echelons/stages, right from [[procurement]] of the [[raw material]]s to the final distribution of finished goods up to the customer. It is based on the basic premise that the supply and distribution activities if integrated with the manufacturing / logistic activities, can result in better profitability for the organization. The [[local minimum]] of total cost of the manufacturing operation is getting replaced by the [[global minimum]] of total cost of the whole chain, resulting in better profitability for the chain members and hence lower costs for the products.

Logistics engineering as a discipline is a very important aspect of [[systems engineering]] that also includes [[reliability engineering]]. It is the science and process whereby [[Reliability_engineering|reliability]], [[maintainability]], and [[availability]] are designed into products or systems. It includes the supply and physical distribution considerations above as well as more fundamental engineering considerations. Logistics engineers work with complex mathematical models that consider elements such as [[mean time between failures]] (MTBF), mean time to failure (MTTF), [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR), [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA), [[statistical distribution]]s, [[queueing theory]], and a host of other considerations. For example, if we want to produce a system that is 95% reliable (or improve a system to achieve 95% reliability), a logistics engineer understands that total system reliability can be no greater than the least reliable subsystem or component. Therefore our logistics engineer must consider the reliability of all subcomponents or subsystems and modify system design accordingly. If a subsystem is only 50% reliable, one can concentrate on improving the reliability of that subsystem, design in multiple subsystems in parallel (5 in this case would achieve approximately 97% reliability of that subsystem), purchase and store spare subsystems for rapid change out, establish repair capability that would get a failed subsystem back in operation in the required amount of time, and/or choose any combination of those approaches to achieve the optimal cost vs. reliability solution.  Then the engineer moves onto the next subsystem.

===The name: logistics engineering===

The are few differences between the terms [[business logistics]] and logistics engineering. Logistics engineering is more focused on the mathematical or scientific application of logistics.&lt;ref&gt;G. Don Taylor, Logistics Engineering Handbook, CRC Press 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fields and topics===

The various fields and topics that logistics engineers are involved with include:

*[[Customer Service]]: provision of services to customers before, during and after a purchase
*[[Purchasing]]: acquiring goods or services to accomplish its goals
*[[Outsourcing|Sourcing]]: procurement practices, aimed at finding, evaluating and engaging suppliers for acquiring goods and services
*[[Demand forecasting]]: the art and science of forecasting customer demand to drive holistic execution of such demand by corporate supply chain and business management
*[[Facility location problem|Facility Location]]: the optimal placement of facilities to minimize transportation costs while considering factors like avoiding placing hazardous materials near housing, and competitors' facilities
*Layout Design
*[[Inventory control]]: the activity of checking a shop’s stock
*[[Material Handling]]: short-distance movement within the confines of a building or between a building and a transportation vehicle
*[[Warehousing]]
*Distribution System Design
*[[Reliability Engineering]]: sub-discipline of systems engineering that emphasizes dependability in the lifecycle management of a product
*[[Reverse logistics]]: the process of moving goods from their typical final destination for the purpose of capturing value, or proper disposal
*[[Green logistics]]: attempts to measure and minimize the ecological impact of logistics activities
*[[Intermodal freight transport|Intermodal transport]]
*Supportability analysis

===Performance metrics===
{{main|Performance metric}}

Different [[performance metric]]s (measures of performance) are used to examine the efficiency of an organization's logistics. The most popular and widely used performance metric is the landed cost. The landed cost is the total cost of purchasing, transporting, warehousing and distributing raw materials, semi-finished and finished goods.

Another performance metric equally important is the end customer [[Service level#.CE.B2 service level .28type 2.2C also known as .22fill rate.22.29|fill rate]]. It is the percentage of customer demand which is satisfied immediately off-the-shelf (from on-site inventory).  An alternative to fill rate, is system [[availability]].

In recent years, the [[United States Department of Defense]] (DoD) has advocated the use of [[performance-based logistics]] (PBL) contracts to manage costs for support of [[weapon system]]s.

'''MIKE 3''' is a [[computer program]] that simulates flows, cohesive sediments, water quality,and ecology in rivers, lakes, estuaries, bays, coastal areas and seas in three dimensions. MIKE 3 was developed by [[DHI (company)|DHI]]. MIKE 3 provides the simulation tools if you need to model 3D free surface flows and associated sediment or water quality processes. MIKE 3 is widely recognized as the gold standard for environmental and ecological studies.  MIKE 3 can be used for assessment of hydrographic conditions for design, construction and operation of structures and plants in stratified waters, environmental impact assessment studies, coastal and oceanographic circulation studies, including fine sediment dynamics, sea ice simulations, lak hydrodynamics, water pollution studies and restoration projects, analysis of cooling water recirculation and desalination, water quality and ecological forecasting, phenomena whenever 3D flow structures is important.

==Introduction==

MIKE 3 is a generalised mathematical modelling system designed for a wide range of applications in areas such as oceanography,coastal regions and estuaries and lakes. The system is fully three-dimensional solving the momentum equation and continuity equationsin the three Cartesian directions.MIKE 3 simulates unsteady flow taking into account density variations, bathymetry and external forcing such as meteorology, tidal elevations, currents and other hydrographic conditions. MIKE 3 can be applied to oceanographic studies,coastal circulation studies, water pollution studies,environmental impact assessment studies,heat and salt recirculation studies and sedimentation studies. MIKE 3 is composed of three fundamental modules: The hydrodynamic (HD) module, the turbulence module and the advection-dispersion (AD) module. Various features such as free surface description, laminar flow description and density variations are optionally invoked within the three fundamental modules. A number of application modules have been implemented and can be invoked optionally. These are advection-dispersion of conservative or linearly decaying substances, a water quality (WQ)module describing BOD-DO relations, nutrients and hygienic problems, a eutrophication (EU) module simulating algae growth and primary production, and a mud transport (MT) module simulating transport along with erosion and deposition of cohesive material. A Lagrangian-based particle (PA) module can also be invoked for simulating e.g. tracers, sediment transport or the spreading and decay of E-Coli bacteria. The modelling system is based on the conservation of mass and momentum in three dimensions of a Newtonian fluid. The flow is decomposed into mean quantities and turbulent fluctuations. The closure problem is solved through the Boussinesq eddy viscosity concept relating the Reynold stresses to the mean velocity field. To handle density variations, the equations for conservation of salinity and temperature are included. An equation of state constitutes the relation between the density and the variations in salinity and temperature and ñ if the MT calculations are invoked ñ mud concentration. In the hydrodynamic module, the prognostic variables are the velocity components in the three directions and the fluid pressure. The model equations are discretised in an implicit, finite difference scheme on a staggered grid and solved non-iteratively by use of the alternating directions' implicit technique. A phase and amplification analysis neglecting effects of viscosity, convective terms, rotation, density variations, etc. has been performed. Under these circumstances, the finite difference scheme is unconditionally stable.

The transport of scalar quantities, such as salinity and temperature, is solved in the advectiondispersion module using an explicit, finite difference technique based on quadratic upstream interpolation in three dimensions. The finite difference scheme, which is accurate to fourth order, has attractive properties concerning numerical dispersion, stability and mass conservation. The decomposition of the prognostic variables into a mean quantity and a turbulent fluctuation leads to additional stress terms in the governing equations to account for the non-resolved processes both in time and space. By the adoption of the eddy viscosity concept these effects are expressed through the eddy viscosity, which is optionally determined by one of the following five closure models:a constant eddy viscosity; the Smagorinsky sub-grid (zero-equation) model; the k- (one-equation) model; the standard k-ε (two-equation) model; and a combination of the Smagorinsky model for the horizontal direction and a k-ε model for the vertical direction.

==Governing Equations==
In a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model for flow of Newtonian fluids, the following elements are required:namely mass conservation; momentum conservation; conservation of salinity and temperature; equation of state relating local density to salinity, temperature and pressure as well as to possible mud concentration. Thus, the governing equations consist of seven (possibly eight) equations with seven (eight)
unknowns.

==Advection-dispersion==
MIKE 3 is applicable to flow problems in which density variations and turbulence are important features. The mathematical modelling of such flows requires the solution of partial differential equations of the advective-diffusive type. The flow modelling will require the solution of the transport equation for salinity,temperature (heat),turbulent kinetic energy (k-equation),dissipation of turbulent kinetic energy (ε-equation). The latter two equations form the well-known k and k-ε turbulence models. For the k-model and the standard k-ε model, the non-linear transport equations are solved by explicit UPWIND scheme. The one-dimensional (vertical) k-ε model essentially forms two one-dimensional diffusion equations, which are efficiently solved by an implicit scheme. The partial differential equations describing transport of salinity and temperature as well as transport of concentrations of substances, water quality and eutrophication components and mud concentration are all linear advective-diffusive type equations, and accordingly the same solution scheme is applied to all these components. A large number of methodologies for solving the advection-diffusion problem are reported in the literature. However, in order to be consistent with the HD module, a finite difference approach was chosen. The QUICKEST (Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics with Estimated Streaming Terms, Leonard (1979)) is applied. The method is based on a conservative control volume formulation. Upstream interpolation is used to determine higher order derivatives. This procedure avoids the stability problems of central differencing while remaining free of the inaccuracies of numerical diffusion associated with the usual upstream differencing. The extension of this scheme to two and three dimensions is given in Justesen et al. (1989), EkebjÊrg and Justesen (1991) and Vested et al. (1992). For use in situations where resolution of steep fronts are important, the scheme has been further improved by implementation of an exponential interpolation at steep fronts, the so-called QUICKEST-SHARP scheme, see also Leonard (1988). Alternatively, the so-called QUICKEST-ULTIMATE scheme, using [[operator splitting]], may optionally be invoked, see e.g. Leonard (1991). This scheme is advantageous in cases with more than one advection-diffusion component, since in MIKE 3 it has been implemented such that the CPU time consumption is practically independent of the number of components.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4337">'''Macrocognition''' indicates a descriptive level of cognition performed in natural instead of artificial (laboratory) environments. This term is reported to have been coined by Pietro Cacciabue and Erik Hollnagel in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;P.C. Cacciabue and E. Hollnagel, "Simulation of Cognition: Applications," Expertise and Technology: Cognition and Human-Computer Cooperation, J.M. Hoc, P.C. Cacciabue, and E. Hollnagel, eds., Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1995, pp. 55–73.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D.E. Klein, H.A. Klein, and G. Klein,
"Macrocognition: Linking Cognitive Psychology and Cognitive Ergonomics," Proc. 5th Int’l Conf. Human Interactions with Complex Systems, Univ. of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 2000, pp. 173–177&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is also reported that the term was used in the 1980s in European Cognitive Systems Engineering research. Possibly the earliest reference is the following, although it does not use the exact term "macrocognition":
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A macro-theory is a theory which is concerned with the obvious regularities of human experience, rather than with some theoretically defined unit. To refer to another psychological school, it would correspond to a theory at the level of Gestalten. It resembles Newell’s suggestion for a solution that would analyse more complex tasks, although the idea of a macro-theory does not entail an analysis of the mechanistic materialistic kind which is predominant in cognitive psychology. Thus we should have a macro-theory of remembering rather than of memory, to say nothing of short-term memory, proactive inhibition release, or memory scanning. To take another example, we should have a macro-theory of attending, rather than a mini-theory of attention, or micro-theories of limited channel capacities or logarithmic dependencies in disjunctive reaction times. This would ease the dependence on the information processing analogy, but not necessarily lead to an abandonment of the information processing terminology, the Flowchart, or the concept of control structures. The meta-technical sciences can contribute to a psychology of cognition as well as to cognitive psychology. What should be abandoned is rather the tendency to think in elementaristic terms and to increase the plethora of mini-and micro-theories.

To conclude, if the psychological study of cognition shall have a future that is not a continued description of human information processing, its theories must be at what we have called the macro-level. This means that they must correspond to the natural units of experience and consider these in relation to the regularities of human experience, rather than as manifestations of hypothetical information processing mechanisms in the brain. A psychology should start at the level of natural units in human experience and try to work upwards towards the level of functions and human action, rather than downwards towards the level of elementary information processes and the structure of the IPS.&lt;ref&gt;Hollnagel, E. (1981). Cognitive psychology: The European and American approaches. (Unpublished manuscript; pdf version available by request to author.)&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The use of the term suggests that there is strong evidence in which naturalistic decision-making and the environments in which they occur are navigated in cognitively different ways than artificial or controlled environments.

Macrocognition is distinguished from [[microcognition]] by elements of time-pressure and risk, performance by experts (as opposed to college students or novices), ambiguity of goals and outcomes, and complex and unclear conditions.

Connel and Lowman, originally called it single-dominance.&lt;ref name="low dive"&gt;Connel, Joseph H.; Lowman, Margaret D. (1989). "Low diversity tropical rainforests: Some possible mechanisms for their existence.". The American Naturalist 134: 88–119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Conventional explanations of [[biodiversity]] in [[tropical forest]]s in the decades prior to Connel and Lowman's work either ignored monodominance entirely or predicted that it would not exist.&lt;ref name="causes"&gt;Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D.; Kursar, Thomas A. (February 2001). "Causes and Consequences of Monodominance in Tropical Lowland Forests". The American Naturalist 157 (2): 141–153. doi:10.1086/318629.&lt;/ref&gt;

Connel and Lowman hypothesized two contrasting mechanisms by which [[Dominance (ecology)|dominance]] can be attained.&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; The first is by fast regrowth in unstable habitats with high disturbance rates. The second is through competitive exclusion in stable habitats that have low disturbance rates.&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; Explanations of persistent monodominace include the monodominant species being more resistant than others to seasonal flooding, or that the monodominance is simply a sere.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; With persistent monodominance, the monodominant species successfully remains so from generation to generation.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt;

== Examples ==
A minimum of 22 species from eight different [[Family (biology)|families]] are known to create monodominant forests.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Examples of persistent monodominance are seen in [[Africa]], [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], and [[Asia]].&lt;ref name="pretest"&gt;Torti, Sylvia D.; Coley, Phyllis D. (June 1999). "Tropical Monodominance: A Preliminary Test of the Ectomycorrhizal Hypothesis". Biotropica (The Association for Tropical Biology and Conservation) 31 (2): 220–228.doi:10.1111/j.1744-7429.1999.tb00134.x.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dipterocarpaceae'' is one example of a plant family that is recognized as persistently [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] in Asia.&lt;ref name="pretest"/&gt; The [[Ectomycorrhiza|ectomycorrhizal tree]] ''Dicymbe corymbosa'', found in central Guyana, creates wide ranges of monodominant forests containing more than 80% of the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] tree species.&lt;ref name="ecto"&gt;McGuire, Krista L.

Netherlands: Springer Science + Business Media B.V., 2008. 287-302. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dominant plants in the [[Neotropics]] and Africa are usually in the [[Leguminosae]] family.&lt;ref name="pretest"/&gt; The species ''Gilbertiodendron dewevrei'', ''Cynometra alexandri'', and ''Julbernardia seretii'' are pronounced as exclusive dominants in their individual forests in equatorial Africa.&lt;ref name="humid"&gt;Hart, T.

== Causes ==
Connel and Lowman originally hypothesized [[ectomycorrhiza]]l association causing the replacement of other species as one of two mechanisms by which a species becomes persistently monodominant; the other is the simple colonization of large gaps.&lt;ref name="low dive"/&gt; However, subsequent research over the years has shown that there is not a single, simple mechanism by which monodominance occurs.&lt;ref name="terese"&gt;Hart, Terese (January 1990). "Monospecific dominance in tropical rain forests.". Trends in Ecology and Evolution (Elsevier Ltd) 5 (1): 6–11.doi:10.1016/0169-5347(90)90005-X.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="anomaly"&gt;Read, Jennifer; Hallam, Patricia; Cherrier, Jean-François (1995). "The anomaly of monodominant tropical rainforests: some preliminary observations in the Nothofagus-dominated rainforests of New Caledonia". Journal of Tropical Ecology (Cambridge University Press) 11(03): 359–389. doi:10.1017/s026646740000883x&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, K. L. (2007). "Recruitment dynamics and ectomycorrhizal colonization of Dicymbe corymbosa, a monodominant tree in the Guiana Shield". Journal of Tropical Ecology 23 (3): 297–307.doi:10.1017/s0266467406003968.&lt;/ref&gt; Monodominant species have been recorded forming at various times after [[forest]] clearance, though this has not been shown to be a predictor of monodominant species persistence. Reliance upon ectomycorrhizae and poor [[soil]]s have not been demonstrated.&lt;ref name="low veg"/&gt; Instead, multiple traits of adult monodominant species hinder the ability of other species to grow, including a dense canopy, a uniform canopy, deep leaf litter, slow nutrient processing, [[Fruiting|mast fruiting]], and poor [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]].

Several causal mechanisms have been proposed for the formation of monodominant forest in [[Tropics|tropical]] [[ecosystem]]s,&lt;ref name="terese"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; including features of the environment such as low [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]] rates, and intrinsic characteristics of the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] species: escape from [[herbivore]]s, high seedling shade-tolerance, and the formation of [[mycorrhizal network]]s between individuals of the same species.&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, K. L. 2007. Common ectomycorrhizal networks may maintain monodominance in a tropical rain forest" Ecology 88(3) 567–574.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canopy ===
The dense [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of the adult trees prevents light from getting into the [[understory]].  In the [[Ituri Rainforest|Ituri]] Forest of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] a monodominant ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forest understory only receives 0.57% full sunlight while a mixed-forest understory received 1.15% full sunlight. This difference may prohibit many plant species from living in that environment due to the low light conditions and their resulting inability to sufficiently and effectively [[Photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Even some species that are more shade tolerant cannot survive the severe low light conditions.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Leaf-litter ===
[[File:Leaf litter.jpg|thumb|Leaf litter]]
A monodominant forest has generally very deep [[leaf litter]] because the leaves are not [[Decomposition|decomposing]] as quickly as in other [[forest]]s. In some monodominant forests the decomposition rates can be two to three times slower than [[mixed forest]]s.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; Low [[ammonium]] and [[nitrate]] could be the result of this slow decomposition which in turn, means less nutrients in the soil for other plant species to use.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Nutrient processing ===
[[Nutrient cycle|Nutrient processing]] is somewhat different from one [[forest]] to another. In the ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forests there is low availability of [[nitrogen]] due to the low levels in the leaves that fall to the ground and the slow [[decomposition]]. This could prevent other plant species from [[Colonisation (biology)|colonizing]] because the soil lacks necessary nutrients.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; In ''[[Parashorea chinensis]]'' forests, trees are known to require more [[Soil fertility|fertile soils]] than in other areas. There is a large amount of [[manganese]] though that prevents other plants from taking root. Manganese can poison other trees if the levels are too high and possibly cause leaf [[chlorosis]] and [[necrosis]] and prevent the nutrient uptake of [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;Van der Velden, N., Ferry Slik, J. W., Hu, Y. H., Lan, G., Lin, L., Deng, X., &amp; Poorter, L. (2014). "Monodominance of ''Parashorea chinensis'' on fertile soils in a Chinese tropical rain forest". ''Journal of Tropical Ecology'', 30(04), 311-322.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mast fruiting ===
Mast [[fruiting]] is a mass fruiting event that overwhelms the animals that consume fruit and helps the seeds' [[survival rate]]. Well-defended leaves also assist in the prevention of [[predation]]. In the ''[[Gilbertiodendron]]'' forests this mast fruiting does not assist in lesser predation, but in [[Asia]] and the [[Neotropics]] this does induce fitness benefits &lt;ref name="VisserJongejans2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Jongejans|first2=Eelke|last3=van Breugel|first3=Michiel|last4=Zuidema|first4=Pieter A.|last5=Chen|first5=Yu-Yun|last6=Rahman Kassim|first6=Abdul|last7=de Kroon|first7=Hans|title=Strict mast fruiting for a tropical dipterocarp tree: a demographic cost-benefit analysis of delayed reproduction and seed predation|journal=Journal of Ecology|volume=99|issue=4|year=2011|pages=1033–1044|issn=00220477|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2745.2011.01825.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is actually important to monodominant maintenance.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Poor dispersal ===
A monodominant [[forest]] has poor [[Dispersal (ecology)|dispersal]] because of the lack of animal dispersers, so many of the [[seed]]s are just dropped from the parent tree and fall to the ground where they [[Germination|germinate]]. This can create a regular and [[wikt:radial|radial]] path around the parent tree that results in a "tree-by-tree replacement" in a [[mixed forest]].&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt; In a monodominant forest the [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] species do not need all of the described traits to overwhelm the area. Though many have a combination, all monodominant forests have at least one of these traits to create the monodominant habitat.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt;

=== Ectomycorrhizal association ===
Many of the [[Tropics|tropical]] monodominant trees are associated with [[Ectomycorrhizal fungus|ectomycorrhizal (ECM) fungi]] networks. [[Mycorrhizal fungi]] are known to effect plant [[Biodiversity|diversity]] trends in a variety of [[ecosystem]]s around the world.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt; [[Ectomycorrhiza]]l relations with trees can increase [[Nutrient|nutrient supplies]] through a more effectual use of larger capacities of [[soil]]s or through the direct [[decomposition]] of [[leaf litter]]. This has been suggested to provide a competitive advantage to such tree species.&lt;ref name="dive top"/&gt;

Examples of ectomycorrhizal trees in [[tropical rainforest]]s can be found in Asia, Africa, and the Neotropics. There is a strong correlation between the ECM association in tropical trees and the occurrence of monodominance.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

[[Fungi]] like mycorrihizae appear not to harm the leaves and even display a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, A. E., and F. Lutzoni. 2007. Diversity and host range of folier fungal endophytes: Are tropical leaves biodiversity hotspots? Ecology 88: 541-549.&lt;/ref&gt; ECM fungi are derived from saprotrophs and retain some ability to decompose organic material. Because tropical soils are often nutrient-poor, ECM trees are predicted to have a competitive advantage over neighboring trees because of their ability to attain more nutrients. With time this could lead to dominance in a tropical rainforest.

==== Ectomycorrhizal mediated mechanisms ====
A study of ''Dicymbe corymbosa'' individuals show that (in terms of total [[basal area]]) the adult trees dominate resources and space. Additionally, they form [[Coppicing|coppices]], also known as [[epicormic shoot]]s, which allow their perseverance over time. Hence, if one stem of the tree dies, it is replaced by another living stem in the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]]. This creates same-species regrowth at stem level. All of this requires high levels of [[carbohydrate]]s and nutrients that are accumulated from the ECM association.
There is evidence that [[masting]] tree species rely on ECM associations to accumulate these requisite nutrients for reproduction during inter-mast years. Associations between resource levels stowed in plant tissue, timing of masting, and ECM patterns propose that [[Ectomycorrhizal fungus|ECM fungi]] are essential in the procurement of nutrients required for large masting trees.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

Seeds of monodominant trees typically have higher rates of [[germination]] and seedling survival when planted in monodominant forests rather than [[mixed forest]]s. Monodominant seedlings planted in mixed forests have significantly lower levels of ECM colonization of [[root]]s. The lower percent of ECM colonization can cause the low [[survival rate]]s of these seedlings in mixed forest.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt; Another mechanism that can be important for seedling and growth survival is a connection to a common [[Ectomycorrhiza|ECM]] network. By connecting their small root systems to ECM networks that emanate from larger adults, more benefits can be received.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

Slower [[decomposition]] rates in monodominant forests have been hypothesized to be a result of competition between [[Saprotrophic nutrition|saprotrophic]] bacteria and [[Fungus|fungi]]. ECM fungi may be suppressing saprotrophs in the monodominant forest to slow decomposition and return organically bound nutrients back to the tree. This is also called the "Gadgil" hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ecto"/&gt;

== Ecological impacts ==
All of the traits that contribute to creating a monodominant forest over time hinder the growth of other plant species and force them to move to a more [[mixed forest]]. Even though this is inconvenient for the plant species that were there, there has not been any evidence that suggests that this is a negative effect of monodominance.&lt;ref name="causes"/&gt; Monodominant forests are also found to have significantly less [[nitrogen]] in their [[soil]] than mixed forests. In these monodominant forests there are a lot of [[Dominance (ecology)|dominant]] tree species from the [[Legume family|legume]] family that have [[nitrogen fixation]]. Nitrogen fixation creates compounds that help a plant to grow in otherwise low nutrient conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Brookshire, E. J., &amp; Thomas, S. A. (2013). Ecosystem Consequences of Tree Monodominance for Nitrogen Cycling in Lowland Tropical Forest. PLoS ONE,8(7), e70491.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9670">'''Nutrition psychology (NP)''' is the psychological study of how cognitive choices, such as meal decisions, influence nutrition, psychological health, and overall health{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}.  Nutrition psychology seeks to understand the relationship between nutritional behavior and mental health/well-being.  NP is a sub-field of [[psychology]] and more specifically of [[health psychology]]. It may be applied to numerous different fields including: [[psychology]], [[dietetics]], [[nutrition]], and [[marketing]]. NP is a fairly new field with a brief history that has already started to contribute information and knowledge to psychology.  There are two main areas of controversy within nutrition psychology. The first area of controversy is that the topic can be viewed in two different ways.  It can be viewed as nutrition affecting psychological functions, or psychological choices and behavior influencing nutrition and health. The second controversy being the defining of what is "healthy" or "normal" as related to nutrition.

==Overview==
{{Synthesis|section|date=April 2018}}
Nutrition is defined as, "the act or process of nourishing or being nourished; ''specifically'':  the sum of the processes by which an animal or plant takes in and utilizes food substances"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nutrition|title = Definition of NUTRITION|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Psychology is defined as, "the study of mind and behavior in relation to a particular field of knowledge or activity,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/psychology|title = Definition of PSYCHOLOGY|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this case, the particular field is nutrition. Therefore, nutrition psychology is the study of mind and behavior in relation to the process of taking in and utilizing food.

=== Objectives ===
Today, over one third of American adults are considered "[[Obesity|obese]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/obesity/data/adult.html|title = Adult Obesity Facts Data Adult Obesity DNPAO CDC|website = www.cdc.gov|access-date = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and nutrition psychology aims to explain what psychological reasons may be behind this and other health trends. Nutrition psychology looks at the internal psychological effects of why people do what they do, and how they are shaped and influenced by outside stimuli.

== Origins and development ==
Nutrition psychology is a field that is still in its early stages of development.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} With [[obesity]] being a continually growing problem in the [[United States]] and abroad, nutrition psychology is gaining importance and popularity in society today. As it has grown, nutrition psychology has directly and indirectly influenced research on [[dieting]], [[Nutrition facts label|food labels]], the way food is marketed, [[food technology]], obesity, and the attitude of the public towards food, among other topics.

Some research discusses the idea of "Food faddism," which is loosely defined as, "the idea that too much weight is put upon the influence of food and diet on overall health and that claims, whether good or bad, are often exaggerated."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jarvis|first=William T.|date=1983-01-01|title=Food Faddism, Cultism, and Quackery|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|journal=Annual Review of Nutrition|volume=3|issue=1|pages=35–52|doi=10.1146/annurev.nu.03.070183.000343|pmid=6315036}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This idea of food choices having extreme consequences is thought to be deeply ingrained into culture, possibly stemming from the story of [[Adam and Eve]] eating the [[forbidden fruit]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Food labels ===
In 1990, the [[Food and Drug Administration|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) required that [[Nutrition facts label|nutrition labels]] be put on food products in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kiesel|first=Kristin|last2=McCluskey|first2=Jill J.|last3=Villas-Boas|first3=Sofia B.|date=2011-01-01|title=Nutritional Labeling and Consumer Choices|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=3|issue=1|pages=141–158|doi=10.1146/annurev.resource.012809.103957}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thought behind doing so was to provide consumers with the necessary information to make educated decisions about the foods that they purchased. Since that time, nutrition psychologists have done research on how influential these labels are on how consumers choose what foods to buy. These studies have shown mixed results concerning the effects of nutritional labeling.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to the research, the average consumer does tend to read the labels and take the information into consideration, in part because companies have begun producing foods with more health-conscious ingredients.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, many of these potential health benefits are overshadowed by the continuing increase in obesity and deaths related to obesity in the United States over the last few decades.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Marketing ===
As with any industry, [[marketing]] plays an important role in the buying and selling of food products. Marketing campaigns for food and beverages are increasingly prevalent today and are larger in scope than ever before, given the resources that large corporations are able to use in the forms of social media and [[viral marketing]]. Some researchers claim that the dramatic rise in obesity rates are at least in part, due to an increase in the marketing of food over the past 30 years.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmerman|first=Frederick J.|date=2011-01-01|title=Using Marketing Muscle to Sell Fat: The Rise of Obesity in the Modern Economy|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|journal=Annual Review of Public Health|volume=32|issue=1|pages=285–306|doi=10.1146/annurev-publhealth-090810-182502|pmid=21219166}}&lt;/ref&gt; New marketing strategies have taken many forms, including changing the packaging of the food or beverage itself, product placement in media, advertisements in schools, increased focus on "value meals" with larger portions, and endorsements by athletes or celebrities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many of these methods increase exposure to younger consumers, who studies show, tend to be more impressionable than adults and whose eating patterns as children can continue long into their adult lives.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There are calls for junk food television advertisements to be banned before 9.00 pm to prevent children seeing them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/jan/23/top-paediatrician-says-its-time-to-give-parents-extra-votes-for-their-children Top paediatrician says it's time to give parents extra votes for their children] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food technology ===
Recently, food has been a source of technological development. Nutrition psychologists have studied the public's perception of food technology such as genetic modification or additives that may extend the shelf life of food, among other topics. In general, the findings show that the average consumer is more likely to avoid food that is affected by technology and will prefer organic, all-natural choices.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lusk|first=Jayson L.|last2=Roosen|first2=Jutta|last3=Bieberstein|first3=Andrea|date=2014-01-01|title=Consumer Acceptance of New Food Technologies: Causes and Roots of Controversies|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735|journal=Annual Review of Resource Economics|volume=6|issue=1|pages=381–405|doi=10.1146/annurev-resource-100913-012735}}&lt;/ref&gt; These technological effects are often perceived by consumers to pose health risks, even if those claims are not founded in facts.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Fad diets ===
Nutrition psychology has many applications not only related to how and what people eat on a day-to-day basis, but also the ways in which and why they [[Dieting|diet]] and [[Physical exercise|exercise]]. [[Fad diet]]s are popular in today's society and they usually play heavily on potential customers' ideals about what they should weigh or look like. These diets usually include an extreme condition or restriction on a person's food intake that supposedly will result in [[Weight Loss/Dieting|weight loss]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bda.uk.com/foodfacts/home|title=Food Facts home|website=www.bda.uk.com|access-date=2016-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; People become attracted to these weight loss claims because of the potential ease with which the weight loss can happen. However, these claims are not always founded in scientific research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The 2004 documentary film, ''[[Super Size Me]]'', directed by and starring [[Morgan Spurlock]] focuses on the ways in which the [[fast food]] industry in America is influencing how people and especially young children, view nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Spurlock|first = Morgan|title = Super Size Me|date = 2004-06-11|url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0390521/?ref_=nv_sr_1|accessdate = 2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22441">'''Overpopulation in domestic pets''' is the [[Overpopulation (biology)|surplus]] of [[pet]]s, such as [[domestic cat|cat]]s, [[domestic dog|dog]]s, and [[Exotic pet|exotic animal]]s. In the United States, a 6 to 8 million animals are brought to [[Animal shelter|shelters]] each year, of which an estimated 3 to 4 million are subsequently [[Animal euthanasia|euthanized]], including 2.7 million considered healthy and adoptable.&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt; Euthanasia numbers have declined from the 1970s, when U.S. shelters euthanized an estimated 12 to 20 million animals.&lt;ref name="HSUS criticism"/&gt; Most [[humane society|humane societies]], [[animal shelter]]s and [[rescue group]]s urge animal caregivers to have their animals [[spaying and neutering|spayed or neutered]] to prevent the births of unwanted and accidental litters that could contribute to this dynamic.&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt;

==Global effects==
Dealing with a population of unwanted domestic animals is a major concern to [[animal welfare]] and [[animal rights]] groups. Domestic animal overpopulation can also be an ecological concern. It is also a financial problem: capturing, impounding and eventual [[animal euthanasia|euthanasia]] costs taxpayers and private agencies millions of dollars each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2010/03/prweb3747034.htm |title=New Research Exposes High Taxpayer Cost For ‘Eradicating’ Free-Roaming Cats |publisher=Prweb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unwanted pets are also commonly released to the wild, sometimes contributing to severe damage to ecosystems (e.g., the effect of introduction of exotic snakes to Florida's [[Everglades]]).

==Statistics==
{{Globalize section|date=March 2018}}
===Bahrain===
In Bahrain the number of stray dogs has been increasing since early 2000s with the situation getting out of hand in late 2010s which caused a lot of controversy regarding the case from people claiming to be bothered and attacked by stray dogs and stray dogs puppies being inhumanely murdered (or burned). On the other hand, since 2014 an act has been put by the Bahrain Society for the Prevention of [[Cruelty to animals|Cruelty to Animals]] (BSPCA) and made a plea to the government to help keep the Catch, Neuter and Return programme (CNVR) running.&lt;ref name="bahrainbspca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.gdnonline.com/NewsDetails.aspx?date=04/07/2015&amp;storyid=359781 |title=Drive to eradicate stray dogs hits snag |publisher=GULF DIGITAL NEWS |date=August 24, 2013 |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent attacks on farms also happened, Sheikha Marwa bint Abdulrahman Al Khalifa also contributed to the case and decided to build a shelter (welfare) for the strays to neuter and rehabilitate them to prevent further attacks while also cooperating with the Bahrain stray dogs society group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tradearabia.com/news/MISC_281760.html|title=Drive to eradicate stray dogs hits snag |publisher=Trade Arabia |date=May 12, 2015 |accessdate=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Canadian Federation of Humane Societies]] (CFHS) has been collecting statistics from Canadian animal shelters since 1993.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} A survey in 2013 included data from 100 of 186 humane societies and [[SPCA]]s.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} However, municipal animal services agencies were not included, hence "the data in this report represents only a fraction of homeless companion animals in Canada."&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|2}} In 2012, the surveyed shelters took in just over 188,000 animals, and euthanized 65,423 animals, representing 35% of all intakes.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|8}} Six times as many cats were euthanized as dogs, or 41% of cats and 15% of dogs.&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|5}} The report said a gradually improving trend, but that cats have a far worse outcome than dogs: "More than twice as many cats enter shelters than dogs, and though adoption rates for cats are similar to those for dogs, fewer cats are reclaimed and many more are euthanized."&lt;ref name="Canadian stats"/&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animal911.ca/half-a-million-unwanted-pets-euthanized-in-quebec-in-2013/ In 2013, half a million unwanted pets were euthanized in Quebec]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Estimates of animals brought to shelters and of animals subsequently euthanized in the U.S. have issues with their reliability. [[The Humane Society of the United States]] provides shelter statistics with this caution: "There is no central [[data reporting]] system for U.S. animal shelters and rescues. These estimates are based on information provided by the (former) National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy."&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt; The HSUS provided numbers of 6 to 8 million animals taken to shelters, 3 to 4 million animals euthanized, and 2.7 million of the euthanized animals being healthy and adoptable, as estimates for 2012-2013,&lt;ref name="HSUS Pets by the numbers"/&gt; and also for annual figures in an August 2014 article.&lt;ref name="HSUS why spay/neuter"/&gt;

The National Council on Pet Population Study and Policy conducted a survey over four years, 1994-1997, and cautions against the use of their survey for wider estimates: "It is not possible to use these statistics to estimate the numbers of animals entering animal shelters in the United States, or the numbers euthanized on an annual basis. The reporting Shelters may not represent a random sampling of U.S. shelters."&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; Summary statistics from the survey said that in 1997, 4.3 million animals entered the surveyed shelters; the shelters euthanized 62.6% of them, or 2.8 million animals.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; These numbers broke down to 56.4% of dogs euthanized, and 71% of cats.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt; The original survey was sent to 5,042 shelters housing at least 100 dogs and cats each year, of whom only 1,008 shelters participated in 1997.&lt;ref name="Pet Population Study"/&gt;

The [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]] provides alternate numbers, saying that there are about 13,600 community animal shelters in the US.&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt; "There is no national organization monitoring these shelters", and "no government institution or animal organization is responsible for tabulating national statistics for the animal protection movement."&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt; However, national estimates are provided of 7.6 million animals entering shelters each year, with 2.7 million of them euthanized.&lt;ref name="ASPCA Pet Stats"/&gt;

The [[American Humane Association]] said the difficulties in estimating numbers, and provides a higher figure, saying that in 2008, an estimated 3.7 million animals were euthanized in shelters.&lt;ref name="AHA euth stats"/&gt;

A 1993 study of US dog populations considered a wider range of sources than animal shelters.&lt;ref name="Article about Patronek study"&gt;[http://www.naiaonline.org/naia-library/articles/are-there-too-many-dogs-and-cats/ "Are there too many dogs and cats?: Pet overpopulation myths and Facts"], Norma Bennett Woolf, National Animal Interest Alliance, March 19, 1997, referring to Gary J. Patronek and Andrew N Rowan, "Determining Dog and Cat Numbers and Population Dynamics", Anthrozoos Vol. 8, No. 4, (1995), pp. 199-205; that article referred to the original 1993 study: [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233502996_Development_of_a_Model_for_Estimating_the_Size_and_Dynamics_of_the_Pet_Dog_Population "Development of a Model for Estimating the Size and Dynamics of the Pet Dog Population"], Gary J. Patronek, Anthrozoos, Vol. 12, 1993; No. 7(1), pp. 25-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The study found that 4 million dogs entered shelters, with 2.4 million (or 60%) euthanized (p.&amp;nbsp;203).&lt;ref name="Patronek 1995"/&gt;

==Reasons for relinquishment==
Unwanted dogs and cats may have been acquired from any source. Large numbers of animals are placed in shelters by pet owners each year for reasons such as moving, allergies, behavioral problems, and lack of time or money, or the pet animal giving birth to young. Another common reason for surrendering a pet is because of milestones, like marriage or the birth of a new baby.&lt;ref name="americanhumane1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanhumane.org/animals/adoption-pet-care/issues-information/pet-overpopulation.html |title=Pet Overpopulation |publisher=Americanhumane.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purebred animals==
The [[American Pet Products Association]] says that since purebreds are only 5% to 6% of the US pet cat population, the overpopulation problem is mainly due to mixed or random bred animals, and avoiding purebred cats would make little difference.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; The [[Humane Society of the United States]] (HSUS) says that 25% of the dogs who enter animal shelters are purebred.{{Relevance inline|reason= This 25% includes lost purebred pets that are subsequently returned to their owners. It doesn't distinguish between purebreds that came from backyard breeders, professional breeders, or puppy mills. For this to mean anything, we'd need to no the relative rate of non-purebred dogs entering shelters, showing that purebreds were disproportionately contributing to unwanted pets. |date=December 2017}}&lt;ref name=HS.org&gt;{{cite web |title=Pets by the Numbers Pet ownership survey data and The HSUS's estimates on pets adopted from or euthanized in U.S. shelters in 2012 and 2013 |url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/pet_overpopulation/facts/pet_ownership_statistics.html |website=Humane Society.org |accessdate=5 January 2015 |date=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) and the [[Cat Fanciers' Association]] (CFA) say the benefits of purebred dogs or cats include that they have been developed over time to show specific traits that are useful for hunting, rescue, assistance and other needs.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; Animal buyers, including pet owners, may choose a purebred to ensure they know ahead of time the size and other characteristics a young animal will grow into.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The CFA also says that purebred cats may make better pets because they have a weaker hunting instinct.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt; The HSUS says that a pedigree is not a guarantee of health and temperament, and that mixed breed dogs and cats often show good characteristics of both breeds, and may be less likely to have genetic defects.&lt;ref name=HSUS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt;

The AKC says [[breeder]]s offer services and information about the animals they sell, such as a detailed pedigree, and expertise in the health and temperament of the breed they specialize in.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS says animal shelters may offer animals that have already had necessary veterinary procedures, such as [[spaying]] or [[neutering]], [[vaccination]], [[deworming]], and [[microchipping]].&lt;ref name=HSUS2012/&gt;

The best practices set by the AKC for responsible breeders include screening customers so animals are placed in a good home, and follow up services including collecting long term health and development data about animals they have bread, and guaranteeing to take back any animals if their situation is not mutually beneficial for the pet and the owner, and then placing them in a new home.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The AKC says that their organization serves to prevent animal cruelty by suspending the benefits of their breed registry and other services from members convicted of animal cruelty, and that their inspection program actively uncovers cases of inhumane treatment of dogs.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS says the AKC has lobbied against laws to stop puppy mills, and that many of the breeders certified as humane by AKC inspectors were later convicted of animal cruelty offenses, while the AKC says it has favored legislation that is necessary, but worked to stop well-intentioned laws that are unenforceable or counterproductive, such as kennel population limits that may harm genetic diversity.&lt;ref name=HSUS2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The HSUS does not advocate banning breeding but encourages prospective pet owners to seek a breed rescue organization rather than buying directly from a breeder.&lt;ref name=AnimalPlanet/&gt;

[[Backyard breeding]] and [[puppy mill]]s are motivated by profit and the perceived high demand for a particular breed, often without concern for the health or welfare of the animals involved. These animals may be sold through [[pet store]]s or directly from the breeders themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.humanesociety.org/issues/puppy_mills/ |title=Puppy Mills: The Humane Society of the United States |publisher=Humanesociety.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AKC says that negligence and cruelty to animals is illegal throughout the US, and that the solution to irresponsible breeding is more effective enforcement of the law, rather than blaming responsible breeders or the demand for purebred animals.&lt;ref name=AKC2012/&gt; The CFA's legislative stance is similar to the AKC.&lt;ref name=CFAleg/&gt; The CFA also says that cat overpopulation is due to free roaming, unaltered pet cats, and feral cats, not purebreds.&lt;ref name=CFAleg/&gt; The CFA says that animal control agencies have failed to publicize complete statistics on the killing of dogs and cats that are dangerously aggressive, concealing the degree to which pet animal euthanasia will always be unavoidable.&lt;ref name=CFAleg&gt;{{Citation |url= http://www.cfa.org/Legislative/LegislativeGroup.aspx |title= CFA's Legislative Group |publisher=[[Cat Fanciers' Association]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to premise==
[[Nathan Winograd]] of the No Kill Advocacy Center, a promoter of [[no-kill shelter]]s, says that overpopulation is a myth and logical fallacy, which many animal control agencies use to avoid criticism for high numbers of killings and low numbers of adoptions.&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Winograd on myth"/&gt; Winograd says that traditional shelters kill animals primarily out of habit and convenience, even when space is available for the animals.&lt;ref name="Overpopulation myth"/&gt;{{rp|6}} He says that using [[trap-neuter-return]] (TNR) for stray and feral cats, his organizations have been able to save all healthy and treatable animals, and raise their save rates to at least 90% of all impounded animals.&lt;ref name="No Kill 101"/&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Out the front door"/&gt; He says there are enough homes for all the homeless animals: "Based on the number of existing households with pets who have a pet die or run away, more homes potentially become available each year for cats than the number of cats who enter shelters, while more than twice as many homes potentially become available each year for dogs than the number of dogs who enter shelters."&lt;ref name="Winograd on myth"/&gt; Winograd says his methods, including TNR for stray and feral cats, and comprehensive changes in animal control, rescue, shelter and community efforts have succeeded in saving all healthy and treatable animals, amounting to at least 90% of all impounded animals.&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt; Winograd says that hundreds of No Kill Communities have been created across the U.S., and they are increasing in number throughout the world.&lt;ref name="Dollars &amp; Sense"/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name="NW Truly no kill"/&gt; In October 2014, the website "Out the Front Door" documented 212 communities in the U.S. saving more than 90% of impounded animals.&lt;ref name="Out the front door"/&gt;

Christie Keith, social media adviser for animal welfare organizations, said in 2012 that the use of the term "overpopulation" to justify shelter killings involves the logical fallacy of a [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]].&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt; If a shelter with no adoption program was able to save more animals when a program was added and then enhanced, was the improvement in save rates due to a "Reduction in 'pet over-population'? Or improvement in shelter management practices?"&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt; When communities are able to save more than 90% of the animals admitted, Keith asks, "Did they reduce 'pet over-population,' or did they become a no-kill community by implementing modern, proven, progressive sheltering practices?"&lt;ref name="Christie Keith"/&gt;{{What?|date=December 2017}}

In a 2008 article, dog advocate Loretta Baughan said that underpopulation was the reality rather than overpopulation. She said that the great majority of pet owners have spayed or neutered their pets, and some shelters were importing large numbers of dogs from other jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spanieljournal.com/33lbaughan.html "Pet underpopulation: The Pet Shortage in the U.S. by Loretta Baughan"], Loretta Baughan, Spaniel Journal, Vol. 6, Issue 4, Jan.-Feb. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology''' ('''OCMA''') is a specialist research group within the School of [[Archaeology]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in [[England]].

==Overview==
Established in 2003 with the ongoing support of the [[Hilti Foundation]], the OCMA is devoted to the study of people who live or work on and around water. The centre offers undergraduate and postgraduate courses in maritime archaeology and fosters research that ranges from the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] and its surrounding seas and oceans to the maritime cultures and peoples of the Indian Ocean and [[South China Sea]] from antiquity to the early modern period. In [[Egypt]], the OCMA collaborates on field projects implemented by the [[Institut Européen d’Archéologie Sous-Marine]] (IEASM),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ieasm.org Institut Européen d'Archéologie Sous-Marine] (IEASM).&lt;/ref&gt; under the direction of [[Franck Goddio]]. In 2011, OCMA began the excavation of shipwreck 43 in [[Aboukir Bay]] and the centre is also involved in work in [[Libya]]. Its research is disseminated through a vigorous programme of international conferences and in-house monograph publication.

==Teaching and research==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology offers post-graduate courses in maritime archaeology and provides post-graduate supervision within the School of Archaeology and the Faculty of Classics.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} The Hilti Foundation funds two postgraduate studentships into research relating to IEASM excavations in ancient [[Heracleion]]. Current{{when|date=December 2013}} post-graduates research includes the Byzantine harbours in [[Greece]] and [[Spain]], and the maritime archaeology of the [[Philippines]], [[Korea]] and [[Cambodia]]. An option in Mediterranean maritime archaeology is also available to undergraduates.

==Excavation==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology is actively engaged in fieldwork as part of its on-going research strategy. It also offers training opportunities in field methods for its students.

===Shipwreck 43, Aboukir Bay===
OCMA is currently{{when|date=December 2013}} excavating shipwreck 43, one of 67 ancient ships so-far recorded by IEASM under Franck Goddio.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, D. (2012). "News"''Nautical archaeology Society Newsletter'' (Winter 2012).&lt;/ref&gt; Tentatively dated to between 785-481 cal BC, the vessel has a distinctive form of naval architecture that has not been fully documented elsewhere in the ancient [[Mediterranean]]. This involved the use of long tenons that were initially fitted into mortice holes that passed through the keel plank over which multiple lines of planking were added, pegged into place with wooden treenails. From the albeit limited excavations, there do not appear to be any frames and consequently the long tenons may have provided the structural stability of the vessel through a kind of ‘internal framework’. As the structural elements of the wreck were made from the locally-available wood [[Acacia]] Totilis/Radiana, it is thought{{who|date=December 2013}} that shipwreck 43 was [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] in origin and thus probably involves a shipbuilding tradition that developed in accordance with the availability of local supplies of timber and the realities of nautical life at the margins of the [[Nile Delta]].

===The Western Marmarica Coastal Survey===
The OCMA supports the Western Marmarica Coastal Survey (WMCS) to investigate the engagement of the Roman and Byzantine countryside with coastal trade in eastern [[Libya]].&lt;ref&gt;Hulin, L. et al. (2008-2010). Reports in ''Libyan Studies'' 39-41 (Winter 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; The region east of [[Tobruk]] was populated by small farms and villages, most of whom exported their produce in amphora made in their own kilns. Although the area lacked the environmental resources to develop into a major centre, it is not isolated. A range of archaeological finds suggest connections, at different times, to [[Cyrenaica]], ca. 250&amp;nbsp;km west and to the [[Egypt]]ian delta, some 600&amp;nbsp;km to the east, as well as contacts across the eastern [[Mediterranean]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]], and through the [[Sahara]] to west [[Africa]] or the [[Sudan]].

==Conferences and publication==
The Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology publishes a monograph series as part of the Institute of Archaeology’s publication programme. The OCMA oversees the scholarly publication of the fieldwork conducted by the IEASM in Alexandria and the submerged Canopic region, as well as post-excavation studies of the material culture recovered from these excavations by IEASM specialists and Hilti Foundation sponsored post-graduate students. The OCMA regularly organizes conferences exploring themes within maritime archaeology or relating to the fieldwork of the IEASM. Volumes arising out of these conferences are also included in the monograph series.

Each volume is assessed by an internal review committee comprising principal members of staff from the Institute of Archaeology, the Oriental Institute, the Classics Centre and the [[Ashmolean Museum]], and are also peer-reviewed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5705">'''Regulated rewriting''' is a specific area of [[formal languages]] studying grammatical systems which are able to take some kind of control over the production applied in a derivation  step. For this reason, the grammatical systems studied in Regulated Rewriting theory are  also called "Grammars with Controlled Derivations". Among such grammars can be noticed:

== Matrix Grammars ==

===Basic concepts===
'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
A Matrix Grammar, &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt;, is a four-tuple &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; where&lt;br /&gt;
1.- &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet of non-terminal symbols&lt;br /&gt;
2.- &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is an alphabet of terminal symbols disjoint with &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
3.- &lt;math&gt;M = {m_1, m_2,..., m_n}&lt;/math&gt; is a finite set of matrices, which are non-empty sequences  
&lt;math&gt;m_{i} = [p_{i_1},...,p_{i_{k(i)}}]&lt;/math&gt;, 
with &lt;math&gt;k(i)\geq 1&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;1 \leq i \leq n&lt;/math&gt;, where each 
&lt;math&gt;p_{i_{j}} 1\leq j\leq k(i)&lt;/math&gt;, is an ordered pair
&lt;math&gt;p_{i_{j}} = (L, R)&lt;/math&gt;
being
&lt;math&gt;L \in (N \cup T)^*N(N\cup T)^*, R \in (N\cup T)^*&lt;/math&gt;
these pairs are called "productions", and are denoted
&lt;math&gt;L\rightarrow R&lt;/math&gt;. In these conditions the matrices can be written down as
&lt;math&gt;m_i = [L_{i_{1}}\rightarrow R_{i_{1}},...,L_{i_{k(i)}}\rightarrow R_{i_{k(i)}}]&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
4.- S is the start symbol

'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
Let &lt;math&gt;MG = (N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; be a matrix grammar and let &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;
the collection of all productions on matrices of &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt;.
We said that &lt;math&gt;MG&lt;/math&gt; is of type i according to Chomsky's hierarchy with &lt;math&gt;i=0,1,2,3&lt;/math&gt;, or "increasing length" 
or "linear" or "without &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt;-productions" if and only if the grammar &lt;math&gt;G=(N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; has the corresponding property.

===The classic example ===
:''Note: taken from Abraham 1965, with change of nonterminals names''
The context-sensitive language 
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n\geq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;
is generated by the &lt;math&gt;CFMG&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;G =(N, T, M, S)&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;N = \{S, A, B, C\}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-terminal set, 
&lt;math&gt;T = \{a, b, c\}&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal set,
and the set of matrices is defined as
&lt;math&gt;M :&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\left[S\rightarrow abc\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[S\rightarrow aAbBcC\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[A\rightarrow aA,B\rightarrow bB,C\rightarrow cC\right]&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;\left[A\rightarrow a,B\rightarrow b,C\rightarrow c\right]&lt;/math&gt;.

==Time Variant Grammars==
'''Basic concepts''' &lt;br /&gt;
'''Definition'''&lt;br /&gt;
A Time Variant Grammar is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, v)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;v: \mathbb{N}\rightarrow 2^{P}&lt;/math&gt; is a function from the set of natural
numbers to the class of subsets of the set of productions.

== Programmed Grammars ==
'''Basic concepts'''

===Definition===
A Programmed Grammar is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, s)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;s, f: P\rightarrow 2^{P}&lt;/math&gt; are the ''success'' and ''fail'' functions from the set of productions
to the class of subsets of the set of productions.

==Grammars with regular control language==

===Basic concepts===
'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
A Grammar With Regular Control Language, 
&lt;math&gt;GWRCL&lt;/math&gt;, is a pair &lt;math&gt;(G, e)&lt;/math&gt; where  &lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; 
is a grammar and &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is a regular expression over the alphabet of the set of productions.

===A naive example===
Consider the CFG
&lt;math&gt;G = (N, T, P, S)&lt;/math&gt; where
&lt;math&gt;N = \{S, A, B, C\}&lt;/math&gt; is the non-terminal set, 
&lt;math&gt;T = \{a, b, c\}&lt;/math&gt; is the terminal set,
and the productions set is defined as
&lt;math&gt;P = \{p_0, p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4, p_5, p_6\}&lt;/math&gt;
being 
&lt;math&gt;p_0 = S\rightarrow ABC&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p_1 = A\rightarrow aA&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_2 = B\rightarrow bB&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_3 = C\rightarrow cC&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;math&gt;p_4 = A\rightarrow a&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;math&gt;p_5 = B\rightarrow b&lt;/math&gt;, and
&lt;math&gt;p_6 = C\rightarrow c&lt;/math&gt;.
Clearly,
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^*b^*c^*\}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now, considering the productions set 
&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; as an alphabet (since it is a finite set),
define the regular expression over &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt;e=p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6)&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining the CFG grammar &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and the regular expression
&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, we obtain the CFGWRCL 
&lt;math&gt;(G,e)
=(G,p_0(p_1p_2p_3)^*(p_4p_5p_6))&lt;/math&gt;
which generates the language
&lt;math&gt;L(G) = \{ a^nb^nc^n : n\geq 1\}&lt;/math&gt;.

Besides there are other grammars with regulated rewriting, the four cited above are good examples of how to extend [[context-free grammars]] with some kind of control mechanism to obtain a [[Turing machine]] powerful grammatical device.

'''Ryman Arts''' is a non-profit fine arts education organization that is based in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Ryman Arts was co-founded in 1990 as the Ryman-Carroll Foundation by Leah and [[Marty Sklar|Martin Sklar]], Ann and [[Harrison Price|Buzz Price]], Walt Disney's daughter [[Disney family|Sharon Disney Lund]], and [[Lucille Carroll|Lucille Ryman Carroll]],&lt;ref name=founders&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rymanarts.org/content/founders|author=Ryman Arts|title=Founders|accessdate=2014-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; to honor [[Herbert Ryman]]. The organization provides free art classes in drawing and painting with master teachers to Los Angeles area high school students. It began with 12 students and by 2007 the program had expanded to include roughly 300 students from 80 Los Angeles-area high schools. Classes are  held on Sundays at the [[Otis College of Art and Design]] and on Saturdays at Cal-State Fullerton. There are classes in the mornings and afternoons, each lasting 3.5 hours. The courses offered are Beginning Drawing, Intermediate Drawing with intro. to Watercolor painting, and Advanced Painting. The organization is supported by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |year=2007 |title=Drawing Positive Conclusions: Ryman Arts's Saturday Studio Classes for Young Artists |url=http://arts.endow.gov/about/NEARTS/story.php?id=p06_drawing&amp;issue=2007_v4 |volume=4 |work=NEA Arts |date= |magazine= |access-date=2009-09-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081006150705/http://arts.endow.gov///about/NEARTS/story.php?id=p06_drawing&amp;issue=2007_v4 |archive-date=2008-10-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment'' ('''Scientific and Technical Center for Building''') CSTB, is the French national organisation providing research and innovation, consultancy, testing, training and certification services in the construction industry.

It was founded in 1947 after the [[World War II|Second World War]] to support the reconstruction effort.

The mission of the CSTB is to ensure the quality and safety of buildings, and support innovation from the idea to the market. It brings together multidisciplinary skills to develop and share essential scientific and technical knowledge, and to provide stakeholders with answers to the challenges of their professional practice.

The CSTB focuses on four key activities: research and consulting, assessment, certification and dissemination of knowledge. Its field of expertise covers construction products, buildings, and their integration into neighborhoods and cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institut-carnot.cstb.fr/en/about-us/missions/ Official website, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexology''' is the scientific study of [[human sexuality]], including human sexual interests, [[Human sexual activity|behavior]]s and functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/sexology|title=Sexology|work=Merriam Webster|accessdate=December 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''sexology'' does not generally refer to the non-scientific study of sexuality, such as [[political science]] or [[social criticism]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt;

Sexologists apply tools from several academic fields, such as [[biology]], [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[sociology]], and [[criminology]]. Topics of study include [[sexual development]] (puberty), [[sexual orientation]], [[gender identity]], [[sexual relationship]]s, sexual activities, [[paraphilia]]s, atypical sexual interests.  It also includes the study of sexuality across the lifespan, including [[child sexuality]], [[puberty]], [[adolescent sexuality]], and [[geriatric sexology|sexuality among the elderly]]. Sexology also spans sexuality among the mentally and/or physically disabled. The sexological study of [[sexual dysfunction]]s and disorders, including [[erectile dysfunction]], [[anorgasmia]], and [[pedophilia]], are also mainstays.

==History==
===Early===
[[sex manual|Sexual manuals]] have existed since antiquity, such as [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', the ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], the ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'' and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]''.  {{lang|fr|De la prostitution dans la ville de Paris}} (''Prostitution in the City of Paris''), an early 1830s study on 3,558 registered prostitutes in [[Paris]], published by Alexander Jean Baptiste Parent-Duchatelet (and published in 1837, a year after he died), has been called the first work of modern sex research.&lt;ref name=Bullough1989&gt;Bullough, V. L. (1989). ''The society for the scientific study of sex: A brief history.'' Mt. Vernon, Iowa: The Foundation for the Scientific Study of Sexuality.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific study of sexual behavior in human beings began in the 19th century. Shifts in [[Europe]]'s national borders at that time brought into conflict laws that were sexually liberal and laws that criminalized behaviors such as homosexual activity.

===Victorian Era to WWII===
[[File:Portrait of Havelock Ellis (1859-1939), Psychologist and Biologist (2575987702) crop.jpg|thumb|[[Havelock Ellis]], a pioneering figure in the movement towards sexual emancipation in the late 19th century.]]

Despite the prevailing social attitude of sexual repression in [[Victorian morality|the Victorian era]], the movement towards sexual emancipation began towards the end of the nineteenth century in England and Germany. In 1886, [[Richard Freiherr von Krafft-Ebing]] published ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis (book)|Psychopathia Sexualis]].'' That work is considered as having established sexology as a scientific discipline.&lt;ref name = Hoenig1977&gt;Hoenig, J. (1977). Dramatis personae: Selected biographical sketches of 19th century pioneers in sexology. In J. Money and H. Musaph (Eds.), ''Handbook of Sexology,'' (pp. 21-43). Elsevier/North-Holland Biomedical Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In England, the founding father of sexology was the doctor and sexologist [[Havelock Ellis]] who challenged the sexual taboos of his era regarding [[masturbation]] and [[homosexuality]] and revolutionized the conception of sex in his time. His seminal work was the 1897 ''Sexual Inversion'', which describes the sexual relations of homosexual males, including men with boys. Ellis wrote the first objective study of homosexuality, (the term was coined by Kertbeny) as he did not characterize it as a disease, immoral, or a crime. The work assumes that same-sex love transcended age [[taboo]]s as well as gender taboos. Seven of his twenty-one case studies are of inter-generational relationships. He also developed other important psychological concepts, such as [[autoerotism]] and [[narcissism]], both of which were later developed further by [[Sigmund Freud]].&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Language of Psycho-analysis|author1=Laplanche, J.|author2=Pontalis, J.B.|date=1988|publisher=Karnac Books|isbn=9780946439492|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DCpokE8C2WgC&amp;pg=PA45|page=45|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ellis pioneered [[transgender]] phenomena alongside the German [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]. He established it as new category that was separate and distinct from homosexuality.&lt;ref name=ttp&gt;Ekins, Richard and King, Dave (2006) ''The transgender phenomenon'', SAGE, {{ISBN|0-7619-7163-7}}, pp. 61-64&lt;/ref&gt; Aware of Hirschfeld's studies of [[transvestism]], but disagreeing with his terminology, in 1913 Ellis proposed the term ''sexo-aesthetic inversion'' to describe the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=ellis1933&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Albert|title=Psychology of Sex|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NSLybrnLVeIC&amp;pg=PA209year=1933|isbn=9781443735322|publisher=Read Books|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5dNnT3GuF_gC&amp;dq=father+of+sexology+ellis|title=The Real Facts Of Life: Feminism And The Politics Of Sexuality C1850-1940|author=Jackson, Margaret|year=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780203992395}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, the first scholarly journal of the field, ''Journal of Sexology'' (Zeitschrift für Sexualwissenschaft), began publication and was published monthly for one year. Those issues contained articles by Freud, [[Alfred Adler]], and [[Wilhelm Stekel]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle&gt;Haeberle, E. J. (1983). ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents.'' World Association for Sexology.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, the first academic association was founded: the ''Society for Sexology''.&lt;ref&gt;Kewenig, W. A. (1983). Foreword. In E. J. Haeberle, ''The birth of sexology: A brief history in documents''. World Association for Sexology. p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud developed a theory of sexuality. These stages of development include: Oral, Anal, Phallic, Latency and Genital. These stages run from infancy to puberty and onwards.&lt;ref name="gutenberg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14969 |title=Three Contributions to the Theory of Sex by Sigmund Freud - Free Ebook |publisher=gutenberg.org|accessdate=July 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on his studies of his clients, between the late 19th and early 20th centuries. [[Wilhelm Reich]] and [[Otto Gross]], were disciples of Freud, but rejected by his theories{{vague|date=November 2013}} because of their emphasis on the role of sexuality in the revolutionary struggle for the emancipation of mankind.

[[Image:1933-may-10-berlin-book-burning.JPG|left|thumb|Hirschfeld's books were burned by the Nazis in Berlin for being "un-German".]]
Pre-Nazi Germany, under the sexually liberal [[Napoleonic code]], organized and resisted the anti-sexual, Victorian cultural influences. The momentum from those groups led them to coordinate sex research across traditional [[academic discipline]]s, bringing Germany to the leadership of sexology. Physician [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] was an outspoken advocate for sexual minorities, founding the [[Scientific Humanitarian Committee]], the first advocacy for homosexual and transgender rights.&lt;ref&gt;Goltz, Dustin (2008). Lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer movements. In A. Lind &amp; S. Brzuzy (Eds.), ''Battleground: Women, gender, and sexuality, 2,'' 291. Greenwood Publishing Group, {{ISBN|978-0-313-34039-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hirschfeld also set up the first [[Institut für Sexualwissenschaft]] (Institute for Sexology) in Berlin in 1919. Its library housed over 20,000 volumes, 35,000 photographs, a large collection of art and other objects. People from around [[Europe]] visited the Institute to gain a clearer understanding of their [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and to be treated for their sexual concerns and dysfunctions.

Hirschfeld developed a system which identified numerous actual or hypothetical types of sexual intermediary between heterosexual male and female to represent the potential diversity of human sexuality, and is credited with identifying a group of people that today are referred to as [[transsexual]] or [[transgender]] as separate from the categories of homosexuality, he referred to these people as 'transvestiten' (transvestites).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Die Transvestiten. Eine Untersuchung über den erotischen Verkleidungstrieb. Mit umfangreichen casuistischen und historischen | location= Leipzig | publisher= Verlag von Max Spohr (Ferd. Spohr) | year= 1910}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last= Hirschfeld | first= Magnus | title= Homosexualitat des Mannes und des Weibes | location= Berlin | year= 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany's dominance in sexual behavior research ended with the [[Nazi Party|Nazi regime]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; The Institute and its library were destroyed by the Nazis less than three months after they took power, May 8, 1933.&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; The institute was shut down and Hirschfeld's books were burned.

Other sexologists in the early [[gay rights]] movement included [[Ernst Burchard]], [[Hans Blüher]], and [[Benedict Friedlaender]]. [[Ernst Gräfenberg]], after whom the [[G-spot]] is named, published the initial research developing the [[intrauterine device]] (IUD).

===Post WWII===
After World War II, sexology experienced a renaissance, both in the United States and Europe. Large scale studies of sexual behavior, sexual function, and [[sexual dysfunction]] gave rise to the development of [[sex therapy]].&lt;ref name=Haeberle/&gt; Post-WWII sexology in the U.S. was influenced by the influx of European refugees escaping the Nazi regime and the popularity of the [[Kinsey Reports|Kinsey studies]]. Until that time, American sexology consisted primarily of groups working to end [[prostitution]] and to educate youth about [[sexually transmitted diseases]].&lt;ref name =Bullough1989/&gt; [[Alfred Kinsey]] founded the [[Institute for Sex Research]] at [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana University]] at [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]] in 1947. This is now called the [[Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender and Reproduction]]. He wrote in his 1948 book that more was scientifically known about the sexual behavior of farm animals than of humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Kinsey | first1 = Alfred C. | last2 = Martin | first2 = Clyde E. | last3 = Pomeroy | first3 = Wardell B. | author-link1 = Alfred Kinsey | author-link2 = Clyde Martin | author-link3 = Wardell Pomeroy | title = Sexual behavior in the human male | page = 3 | publisher = W.B. Saunders | location = New York and Philadelphia | year = 1948 | oclc = 705195970 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist and sexologist [[John Money]] developed theories on sexual identity and [[gender identity]] in the 1950s. His work, notably on the [[David Reimer]] case has since been regarded as controversial, even while the case was key to the development of treatment protocols for [[intersex]] infants and children.&lt;ref name="diamond"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Diamond | first1 = Milton | last2 = Sigmundson | first2 = H.

[[Kurt Freund]] developed the [[penile plethysmograph]] in [[Czechoslovakia]] in the 1950s. The device was designed to provide an objective measurement of [[sexual arousal]] in males and is currently used in the assessment of [[pedophilia]] and [[hebephilia]]. This tool has since been used with [[sex offenders]].&lt;ref name="apobit"&gt;{{cite news | last = Associated Press | title = Kurt Freund, 82, notable sexologist | url = http://www.s-t.com/daily/10-96/10-29-96/c06wn888.htm | date = October 26, 1996 }} {{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kubanobit"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Kuban | first = Michael | title = Sexual Science Mentor: Dr. Kurt Freund | journal = Sexual Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2 | url = http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101222215801/http://sexscience.org/uploads/media/sex_sci45-2.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2010-12-22 | date = Summer 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 and 1970, [[Masters and Johnson]] released their works ''Human Sexual Response'' and ''Human Sexual Inadequacy,'' respectively. Those volumes sold well, and they were founders of what became known as the [[Masters &amp; Johnson Institute]] in 1978.

[[Vern Bullough]] was a historian of sexology during this era, as well as being a researcher in the field.&lt;ref name="vernbullough"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040727172744/http://www.vernbullough.com/bullough/publications/publicationsindex.html |archivedate=July 27, 2004 |dead-url=yes |title=Dr. Vern L. Bullough: Profile |publisher=web.archive.org |website=vernbullough.com |accessdate=July 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[HIV/AIDS]] in the 1980s caused a dramatic shift in sexological research efforts towards understanding and controlling the spread of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Gagnon | first = John H. | title = Sex research and sexual conduct in the era of AIDS | journal = [[Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes]] | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 593–601 | publisher = [[Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins]] | pmid = 3225745 | date = December 1988 | url = http://journals.lww.com/jaids/Abstract/1988/12000/Sex_Research_and_Sexual_Conduct_in_the_Era_of.11.aspx | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Oriel | first = Jennifer | title = Sexual pleasure as a human right: Harmful or helpful to women in the context of HIV/AIDS? | journal = [[Women's Studies International Forum]] | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 392–404 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | date = September 2005 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wsif.2005.05.002 | ref = harv | postscript = .}} [https://www.amherst.edu/media/view/248654/original/sexual+pleasure+as+a+HR.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''sociology of art''' is a subfield of [[sociology]] concerned with the social worlds of [[art]] and [[aesthetics]].

Studying the sociology of art throughout history is the study of the [[social history of art]], how various societies contributed to the appearance of certain artists.

In her 1970 book ''Meaning and Expression: Toward a Sociology of Art'', Hanna Deinhard gives these defining features of a sociology of art: "The point of departure of the sociology of art is the question: How is it possible that works of art, which always originate as products of human activity ''within'' a particular time and society and ''for'' a particular time, society, or function -- even though they are not necessarily produced as 'works of art' -- can live beyond their time and seem expressive and meaningful in completely different epochs and societies? On the other hand, how can the age and society that produced them be recognized in the works?&lt;ref name="M&amp;E" /&gt;"

{{political anthropology}}
'''State formation''' is the process of the development of a centralized government structure in a situation where one did not exist prior to its development.  State formation has been a study of many disciplines of the [[social science]]s for a number of years, so much so that Jonathan Haas writes that "One of the favorite pastimes of social scientists over the course of the past century has been to theorize about the evolution of the world's great civilizations."{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=1}} The study of state formation is divided generally into either the study of early states (those that developed in [[Stateless society|stateless societies]]) or the study of modern states (particularly of the form that developed in Europe in the 17th century and spread around the world). Academic debate about various theories is a prominent feature in fields like Anthropology, Sociology, Economics and Political Science.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=523}}

==The state==
{{main|State (polity)}}
A state is a political system with a centralized government, a military force, a civil service, an arranged society, and literacy. Though, there is no clear agreement on the defining characteristics of a state and the definition can vary significantly, based upon the focus of the particular definition.{{sfn|Haas|1982|pp=2-3}} The state is considered to be territoriality bound and is distinct from tribes or units without centralized institutions.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=2-5}}

According to Painter &amp; Jeffrey, there are 5 distinctive features of the modern state:

1) They are ordered by precise boundaries with administrative control across the whole;

2) They occupy large territories with control given to organized institutions;

3) They have a capital city and are endowed with symbols that embody state power;

4) The government within state creates organizations to monitor, govern and control its population through surveillance and record keeping;

5) They increase monitoring over time.{{sfn|Painter|Jeffrey|2009|pp=22-24}}

Additionally, Herbst holds that there is another relevant characteristic of modern states: [[nationalism]]. This feeling of belonging to a certain territory plays a central role in state formation since it increases citizens' willingness to pay taxes.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

==Explaining early states and explaining modern states==
Theories of state formation have two distinct focuses, depending largely on the field of study:

# The early transition in human society from tribal communities into larger political organizations.  Studies of this topic, often in [[anthropology]], explore the initial development of basic administrative structures in areas where states developed from stateless societies.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=129}} Although state formation was an active research agenda in anthropology and archaeology until the 1980s, some of the effort has changed to focus not on why these states formed but on how they operated.{{sfn|Marcus|Feinman|1998|p=3}} 
# In contrast, studies in [[political science]] and in [[sociology]] have focused significantly on the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=131}}

States are minimally defined by anthropologist David S. Sandeford as socially stratified and bureaucratically governed societies with at least four levels of settlement hierarchy (e.g., a large capital, cities, villages, and hamlets). Primary states are those state societies that developed in regions where no states existed before. These states developed by strictly internal processes and interaction with other non-states societies.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}} The exact number of cases which qualify as primary states is not clearly known because of limited information about political organization before the development of writing in many places,{{sfn|Wright|1977|p=386}} but Sandeford lists ten likely cases of primary state formation in Eurasia, the Americas, and the Pacific.{{sfn|Sandeford|2018}}

Studies on the formation of '''early states''' tend to focus on processes that create and institutionalize a state in a situation where a state did not exist before. Examples of early states which developed in interaction with other states include the [[Aegean civilizations|Aegean Bronze Age Greek civilizations]] and the [[Malagasy culture#Madagascar|Malagasy civilization in Madagascar]].{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=306}} Unlike primary state formation, early state formation does not require the creation of the first state in that cultural context or development autonomously, independently from state development nearby. Early state formation causation can thus include borrowing, imposition, and other forms of interaction with already existing states.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=50}}

===Modern state formation===
Theories on the formation of modern states focus on the processes that support the development of modern states, particularly those that formed in late-medieval Europe and then spread around the world with colonialism. Starting in the 1940s and 1950s, with [[decolonization]] processes underway, attention began to focus on the formation and construction of modern states with significant bureaucracies, ability to tax, and territorial sovereignty around the world.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=153}}{{sfn|Spruyt|2002|p=132}} However, some scholars hold that the modern state model formed in other parts of the world prior to colonialism, but that colonial structures replaced it.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=13}}

==Theories about early state development==
There are a number of different theories and hypotheses regarding early state formation that seek generalizations to explain why the state developed in some places but not others. Other scholars believe that generalizations are unhelpful and that each case of early state formation should be treated on its own.{{sfn|Spencer|Redmond|2004|p=174}}

===Voluntary theories===
[[File:City context.svg|thumb|right|Uruk one of the prime sites for research into early state formation]]
Voluntary theories contend that diverse groups of people came together to form states as a result of some shared rational interest.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} The theories largely focus on the development of agriculture, and the population and organizational pressure that followed and resulted in state formation.  The argument is that such pressures result in integrative pressure for rational people to unify and create a state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=21}} Much of the [[social contract]] philosophical tradition proposed a voluntary theory for state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=21-23}}

One of the most prominent theories of early and primary state formation is the ''hydraulic hypothesis'', which contends that the state was a result of the need to build and maintain large-scale irrigation projects.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}} The theory was most significantly detailed [[Karl August Wittfogel]]'s argument that, in arid environments, farmers would be confronted by the production limits of small-scale irrigation. Eventually different agricultural producers would join together in response to population pressure and the arid environment, to create a state apparatus that could build and maintain large irrigation projects.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}}

In addition to this, is what Carneiro calls the ''automatic hypothesis'', which contends that the development of agriculture easily produces conditions necessary for the development of a state. With surplus food stocks created by agricultural development, creation of distinct worker classes and a division of labor would automatically trigger creation of the state form.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}}

A third voluntary hypothesis, particularly common with some explanations of early state development, is that long distance trade networks created an impetus for states to develop at key locations: such as ports or oases. For example, the increased trade in the 16th century may have been a key to state formation in West African states such as [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]], [[Dahomey]], and the [[Benin Empire]].{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Conflict theories===
Conflict theories of state formation regard conflict and dominance of some population over another population as key to the formation of states.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=734}} In contrast with voluntary theories, these arguments believe that people do not voluntarily agree to create a state to maximize benefits, but that states form due to some form of oppression by one group over others. A number of different theories rely on conflict, dominance, or oppression as a causal process or as a necessary mechanism within certain conditions and they may borrow from other approaches. In general the theories highlight: ''economic stratification'', ''conquest of other peoples'', conflict in ''circumscribed areas'', and the neoevolutionary growth of bureaucracy. 
[[File:Panorama of Monte Alban from the South Platform.jpg|thumb|center|650px|Panorama of Monte Albán in present-day Mexico, seen from the South Platform. Archeologists oftentimes look for evidence of such "large-scale construction projects, trade networks, and religious systems" to identify early states.{{sfn|Haas|1981|p=82}}]]

:*'''''Economic stratification'''''
:: [[Friedrich Engels]] articulated one of the earliest theories of the state based on anthropological evidence in ''[[The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State]]'' (1884).{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=6}} The theory of Engels developed from study of ''Ancient Society'' (1877) by [[Lewis H. Morgan]] and from the sketches of this work by [[Karl Marx]] on the [[Asiatic mode of production]].{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=25-26}} Engels argues that the state developed as a result of the need to protect private property. The theory contended that surplus production as a result of the development of agriculture created a division and specialization of labor: leading to classes who worked the land and to those who could devote time to other tasks. Class antagonism and the need to secure the private property of those living on the surplus production produced by agriculturalists resulted in the creation of the state.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=7}} The anthropologist [[Morton Fried]] (1923-1986) further developed this approach, positing social stratification as the primary dynamic underlying the development of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}}

:*'''''Conquest theories'''''
:: Similar to the economic stratification theories, the conquest theory contends that a single city establishes a state in order to control other tribes or settlements it has conquered. The theory has its roots in the work of [[Ibn Khaldun]] (1332-1406) and of [[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596), but it was first organized around anthropological evidence by [[Franz Oppenheimer]] (1864-1943).{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Gross|1999|p=5}} Oppenheimer argues that the state was created to cement inequality between peoples that resulted from conquest.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=10}}

:*'''''Carneiro's circumscription theory'''''
[[File:Macchupicchu.jpg|thumb|right|The mountain [[Huayna Picchu]] overlooks the ruins of [[Machu Picchu]]. The [[Andes]] mountains circumscribed much of the region.]] 
:{{main|Carneiro's circumscription theory}}
::[[Robert Carneiro]] developed a theory (1970){{sfn|Carneiro|1970}} aiming to provide a more nuanced understanding of state formation by accounting for the fact that many factors (surplus agriculture, warfare, irrigation, conquest, etc.) did not produce states in all situations. He concluded that while population pressure and warfare were mechanisms of state formation, they only created states in geographic regions circumscribed, or walled off from the surrounding area.{{sfn|Claessen|Skalnik|1978|p=13}} Geographic barriers (or in some cases barriers created by nomadic raiders or by rival societies) create limitations on the ability of the people to deal with production shortfalls, and the result is that warfare results in state creation.{{sfn|Service|1978|pp=28-29}} In situations of unlimited agricultural land (like the Amazon or the Eastern United States), Carneiro believes that the pressures did not exist and so warfare allowed people to move elsewhere and thus did not spur creation of a state.{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|pp=734-735}}

:*'''''Neoevolutionary theories'''''
:{{further|Neoevolutionism}}
::A number of different theories, sometimes connected with some of the processes above, explain state formation in terms of the [[Sociocultural evolution|evolution]] of [[leadership]] systems. This argument sees human society as evolving from [[tribe]]s or [[chiefdom]]s into states through a gradual process of transformation that lets a small group hierarchically structure society and maintain order through appropriation of [[symbol]]s of power.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=8}} Groups that gained power in tribal society gradually worked towards building the hierarchy and segmentation that created the state.{{sfn|Blanton|Fargher|2008|p=9}}

::[[Elman Service]] (1915-1996) proposed that, unlike in economic stratification theories, the state largely creates stratification in society rather than being created to defend that stratification.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=38}} Bureaucracy evolves to support the leadership structure in tribes and uses religious hierarchy and economic stratification as a means to further increase its power.{{sfn|Haas|1982|p=73}} Warfare may play a key role in the situation, because it allows leaders to distribute benefits in ways that serve their interests, however it is a constant that feeds the system rather than an autonomous factor.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=51}} Similarly, anthropologist [[Henry T. Wright]] argues (2006) that competitive and conflictual environments produce political experimentation leading to the development of the state. As opposed to theories that the state develops through chance or tinkering, experimentation involves a more directed process where tribal leaders learn from organization forms of the past and from the outcomes they produced.{{sfn|Wright|2006|p=316}}

===Other theories===
Other aspects are highlighted in different theories as of contributing importance. It is sometimes claimed that technological development, religious development, or socialization of members are crucial to state development. However, most of these factors are found to be secondary in anthropological analysis.{{sfn|Cohen|1978|pp=61-68}} In addition to conquest, some theories contend that the need for defense from military conquest or the military organization to conquer other peoples is the key aspect leading to state formation.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=30}}

===Discredited theories===
Some theories proposed in the 19th century and early 20th century have since been largely discredited by anthropologists. Carneiro writes that theories "with a racial basis, for example, are now so thoroughly discredited that they need not be dealt with...We can also reject the belief that the state is an expression of the 'genius' of a people, or that it arose through a 'historical accident.' Such notions make the state appear to be something metaphysical or adventitious, and thus place it beyond scientific understanding."{{sfn|Carneiro|1970|p=733}} Similarly, [[Social Darwinism|social Darwinist]] perspectives like those of [[Walter Bagehot]] in ''Physics and Politics'' argued that the state form developed as a result of the best leaders and organized societies gradually gaining power until a state resulted. Such explanations are not considered sufficient to explain the formation of the state.{{sfn|Service|1978|p=24}}{{sfn|Cohen|1978|p=42}}

==Theories about modern state development==
In the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] (500-1400) in Europe, there were a variety of authority forms throughout the region. These included feudal lords, empires, religious authorities, free cities, and other authorities.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} Often dated to the 1648 [[Peace of Westphalia]], there began to be the development in Europe of modern states with large-scale capacity for taxation, coercive control of their populations, and advanced bureaucracies.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} The state became prominent in Europe over the next few centuries before the particular form of the state spread to the rest of the world via the colonial and international pressures of the 19th century and 20th century.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=535}} Other modern states developed in Africa and Asia prior to colonialism, but were largely displaced by colonial rule.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=12}}

Political scientists, sociologists, and anthropologists began studying the state formation processes in Europe and elsewhere in the 17th century—beginning significantly with [[Max Weber]]. However, state formation became a primary interest in the 1970s. The question was often framed as a contest between state forces and society forces and the study of how the state became prominent over particular societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=525}} A number of theories developed regarding state development in Europe. Other theories focused on the creation of states in late colonial and post-colonial societies.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}  The lessons from these studies of the formation of states in the modern period are often used in theories about [[State-building]]. Other theories contend that the state in Europe was constructed in connection with peoples from outside Europe and that focusing on state formation in Europe as a foundation for study silences the diverse history of state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=8}}

Based on the model of European states, it has been commonly assumed that development is the natural path that states will eventually walk through. However, Herbst holds that in the case African states, as well as in developing countries of other regions, development need not be the natural step. States that struggle their consolidation could remain permanently weak.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}}

===Warfare theories===
[[File:Defenestration-prague-1618.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A woodcut of the [[Defenestrations of Prague]] in 1618—which began the [[Thirty Years' War]] and ended with the Peace of Westphalia that started the recognition of the modern state]]

Two related theories are based on military development and warfare, and the role that these forces played in state formation. [[Charles Tilly]] developed an argument that the state developed largely as a result of "state-makers" who sought to increase the taxes they could gain from the people under their control so they could continue fighting wars.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527}} According to Tilly, the state makes war and war makes states.{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=170}} In the constant warfare of the centuries in Europe, coupled with expanded costs of war with mass armies and gunpowder, warlords had to find ways to finance war  and control territory more effectively. The modern state presented the opportunity for them to develop taxation structures, the coercive structure to implement that taxation, and finally the guarantee of protection from other states that could get much of the population to agree.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=527-528}} Taxes and revenue raising have been repeatedly pointed out as a key aspect of state formation and the development of state capacity. Economist [[Nicholas Kaldor]] emphasized on the importance of revenue raising and warned about the dangers of the dependence on foreign aid.{{sfn|Kaldor|1963}} Tilly argues, state making is similar to organized crime because it is a "quintessential protection racket with the advantage of legitimacy."{{sfn|Tilly|1985|p=169}}

[[Michael Roberts (historian)|Michael Roberts]] and [[Geoffrey Parker (historian)|Geoffrey Parker]], in contrast, finds that the primary causal factor was not the "state-makers" themselves, but simply the military revolutions that allowed development of larger armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=5}} The argument is that with the expanded state of warfare, the state became the only administrative unit that could endure in the constant warfare in the Europe of this period, because only it could develop large enough armies.{{sfn|Thompson|Rasler|1999|p=6}} 
This view—that the modern state replaced chaos and general violence with internal disciplinary structures—has been challenged as ethnocentric, and ignoring the violence of modern states.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=19}}

War has played a key role not only in the consolidation of European states but also of some third world states. According to Herbst, external security threats have had a fundamental role in the development of the [[South Korea]]n and [[Taiwan]]ese states.{{sfn|Herbst|1990}} A 2017 study which tests the predictions of warfare theories of Tilly and others found that the predictions do not match the empirical record.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The study found that median state size decreased from 1100 to 1800, and that the number of states increases rapidly between the twelfth and thirteen centuries and remained constant until 1800.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Commerce theories===
[[Stein Rokkan]] and others have argued that the modern territorial state developed in places that were peripheral to the commercial "city belt" ("a central regional band extending, roughly, in an arc from the Low Countries, through the Rhineland and into Northern Italy") that ran through Central Europe.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The existence of prosperous urban centers that relied on commerce in Central Europe prevented rulers from consolidaing their rule over others.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}} The elites in those urban centers could rely on their wealth and on collective security institutions (like the Hanseatic or Swabian league) with other urban centers to sustain their independence. A lower density of urban centers in England and France made it easier for rulers to establish rule over expansive territories.{{sfn|Abramson|2017}}

===Feudal crisis theories===
Another argument contends that the state developed out of economic and social crises that were prominent in late-medieval Europe. Religious wars between Catholics and Protestants, and the involvement of leaders in the domains of other leaders under religious reasons was the primary problem dealt with in the Peace of Westphalia.{{sfn|Axtmann|2004|p=260}} In addition, Marxist theory contends that the economic crisis of feudalism forced the aristocracy to adapt various centralized forms of organization so they could retain economic power, and this resulted in the formation of the modern state.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=529}}

===Cultural theories===
Some scholarship, linked to wider debates in Anthropology, has increasingly emphasized the state as a primarily cultural artifact, and focuses on how symbolism plays a primary role in state formation.{{sfn|Krohn-Hansen|Nustad|2005|p=9}} Most explicitly, some studies emphasize how the creation of national identification and citizenship were crucial to state formation. The state then is not simply a military or economic authority, but also includes cultural components creating consent by people by giving them rights and shared belonging.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=530}}

===Outside Europe===
While modern states existed without European influence around the world before colonialism,{{sfn|Ejogu|2011|p=595}} post-colonial state formation has received the most significant attention.{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} While warfare is primary in theories about state formation in Europe, the development of the international norm of [[non-interventionism]] means that other processes of state formation have become prominent outside Europe (including colonial imposition, assimilation, borrowing, and some internal political processes.{{sfn|Barkey|Parikh|1991|p=531}}{{sfn|Southall|1974|p=155}} [[John W. Meyer|John W. Meyer's]] ''World Society Theory'' contends that the state form was exported from Europe, institutionalized in the United Nations, and gradually the modern nation-state became the basis for both those in power and those challenging power.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}} In addition, because many of the early modern states like the United Kingdom and France had significant empires, their institutional templates became standard for application globally.{{sfn|Wimmer|Feinstein|2010|p=769}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19901">In [[mathematics]], a '''t-norm''' (also '''T-norm''' or, unabbreviated, '''triangular norm''') is a kind of [[binary operation]] used in the framework of [[probabilistic metric space]]s and in [[multi-valued logic]], specifically in [[fuzzy logic]]. A t-norm generalizes [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] in a [[lattice (order)|lattice]] and [[logical conjunction|conjunction]] in [[logic]]. The name ''triangular norm'' refers to the fact that in the framework of probabilistic metric spaces t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary [[metric space]]s.

== Definition ==

A t-norm is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] T: [0,&amp;nbsp;1] &amp;times; [0,&amp;nbsp;1] → [0,&amp;nbsp;1] which satisfies the following properties:
* [[Commutativity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') = T(''b'', ''a'')
* [[Monotonicity]]: T(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* [[Associativity]]: T(''a'', T(''b'', ''c'')) = T(T(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* The number 1 acts as [[identity element]]: T(''a'', 1) = ''a''

Since a t-norm is a [[binary operation|binary algebraic operation]] on the interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1], infix algebraic notation is also common, with the t-norm usually denoted by&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt;.

The defining conditions of the t-norm are exactly those of the partially ordered Abelian monoid on the real unit interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. '' (Cf.&amp;nbsp;[[ordered group]].)'' The monoidal operation of any partially ordered Abelian monoid ''L'' is therefore by some authors called a ''triangular norm on L''.

=== Motivations and applications ===

T-norms are a generalization of the usual two-valued [[logical conjunction]], studied by classical logic, for [[fuzzy logic]]s. Indeed, the classical Boolean conjunction is both commutative and associative. The monotonicity property ensures that the [[degree of truth]] of conjunction does not decrease if the [[truth value]]s of conjuncts increase. The requirement that 1 be an identity element corresponds to the interpretation of 1 as ''true'' (and consequently 0 as ''false''). Continuity, which is often required from fuzzy conjunction as well, expresses the idea that, roughly speaking, very small changes in truth values of conjuncts should not macroscopically affect the truth value of their conjunction.

T-norms are also used to construct the [[intersection (set theory)|intersection]] of [[fuzzy set]]s or as a basis for aggregation operators (see [[fuzzy set operations]]). In [[probabilistic metric space]]s, t-norms are used to generalize [[triangle inequality]] of ordinary metric spaces. Individual t-norms may of course frequently occur in further disciplines of mathematics, since the class contains many familiar functions.

=== Classification of t-norms ===

A t-norm is called ''continuous'' if it is [[continuous function|continuous]] as a function, in the usual interval topology on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (Similarly for ''left-'' and ''right-continuity''.)

A t-norm is called ''strict'' if it is continuous and [[monotonic function|strictly monotone]].

A t-norm is called ''nilpotent'' if it is continuous and each ''x'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) is its [[nilpotent]] element, i.e., there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) equals&amp;nbsp;0.

A t-norm &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is called ''Archimedean'' if it has the [[Archimedean property]], i.e., if for each ''x'', ''y'' in the open interval (0,&amp;nbsp;1) there is a natural number ''n'' such that ''x'' &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ... &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; ''x'' (''n''&amp;nbsp;times) is less than or equal to ''y''.

The usual partial ordering of t-norms is pointwise, i.e.,
: T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;nbsp; if &amp;nbsp; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') ≤ T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''a'', ''b'') for all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
As functions, pointwise larger t-norms are sometimes called ''stronger'' than those pointwise smaller. In the semantics of fuzzy logic, however, the larger a t-norm, the ''weaker'' (in terms of logical strength) conjunction it represents.

*'''Minimum t-norm''' &lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{min}}(a, b) = \min \{a, b\},&lt;/math&gt; also called the '''Gödel t-norm''', as it is the standard semantics for conjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]]. Besides that, it occurs in most t-norm based fuzzy logics as the standard semantics for weak conjunction. It is the pointwise largest t-norm (see the [[#Properties of t-norms|properties of t-norms]] below).

:is a strict Archimedean t-norm, and an important representative of the parametric classes of [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]] and [[Construction of t-norms#Schweizer–Sklar t-norms|Schweizer–Sklar t-norms]].

==Properties of t-norms==

The drastic t-norm is the pointwise smallest t-norm and the minimum is the pointwise largest t-norm:
:&lt;math&gt;\top_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)  \le \top(a, b) \le \mathrm{\top_{min}}(a, b),&lt;/math&gt; for any t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

For every t-norm T, the number 0 acts as null element: T(''a'', 0) = 0 for all ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

A t-norm T has [[zero divisor]]s if and only if it has [[nilpotent element|nilpotent]] elements; each nilpotent element of T is also a zero divisor of T. The set of all nilpotent elements is an interval [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''] or [0,&amp;nbsp;''a''), for some ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

=== Properties of continuous t-norms ===

Although real functions of two variables can be continuous in each variable without being continuous on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, this is not the case with t-norms: a t-norm T is continuous if and only if it is continuous in one variable, i.e., if and only if the functions ''f&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''(''x'') = T(''x'', ''y'') are continuous for each ''y'' in  [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Analogous theorems hold for left- and right-continuity of a t-norm.

A continuous t-norm is Archimedean if and only if 0 and 1 are its only [[idempotent]]s.

A continuous Archimedean t-norm is strict if 0 is its only [[nilpotent]] element; otherwise it is nilpotent. By definition, moreover, a continuous Archimedean t-norm T is nilpotent if and only if ''each'' ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1 is a nilpotent element of T. Thus with a continuous Archimedean t-norm T, either all or none of the elements of (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent. If it is the case that all elements in (0,&amp;nbsp;1) are nilpotent, then the t-norm is isomorphic to the Łukasiewicz t-norm; i.e., there is a strictly increasing function ''f'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(x,y) = f^{-1}(\top_{\mathrm{Luk}}(f(x), f(y))).&lt;/math&gt;
If on the other hand it is the case that there are no nilpotent elements of T, the t-norm is isomorphic to the product t-norm. In other words, all nilpotent t-norms are isomorphic, the Łukasiewicz t-norm being their prototypical representative; and all strict t-norms are isomorphic, with the product t-norm as their prototypical example. The Łukasiewicz t-norm is itself isomorphic to the product t-norm undercut at 0.25, i.e., to the function ''p''(''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'') = max(0.25, ''x''&amp;nbsp;&amp;middot;&amp;nbsp;''y'') on [0.25,&amp;nbsp;1]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

For each continuous t-norm, the set of its idempotents is a closed subset of [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Its complement — the set of all elements which are not idempotent — is therefore a union of countably many non-overlapping open intervals. The restriction of the t-norm to any of these intervals (including its endpoints) is Archimedean, and thus isomorphic either to the Łukasiewicz t-norm or the product t-norm. For such ''x'', ''y'' that do not fall into the same open interval of non-idempotents, the t-norm evaluates to the minimum of ''x'' and ''y''. These conditions actually give a characterization of continuous t-norms, called the '''Mostert–Shields theorem''', since every continuous t-norm can in this way be decomposed, and the described construction always yields a continuous t-norm. The theorem can also be formulated as follows:
:A t-norm is continuous if and only if it is isomorphic to an [[Construction of t-norms#Ordinal sums|ordinal sum]] of the minimum, Łukasiewicz, and product t-norm.

A similar characterization theorem for non-continuous t-norms is not known (not even for left-continuous ones), only some non-exhaustive methods for the [[construction of t-norms]] have been found.

== Residuum ==

For any left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, there is a unique binary operation &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; on [0,&amp;nbsp;1] such that
:&lt;math&gt;\top(z, x) \le y&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;z \le (x \Rightarrow y)&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. This operation is called the ''residuum'' of the t-norm. In prefix notation, the residuum to a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is often denoted by &lt;math&gt;\vec{\top}&lt;/math&gt; or by the letter R.

The interval [0,&amp;nbsp;1] equipped with a t-norm and its residuum forms a [[residuated lattice]]. The relation between a t-norm T and its residuum R is an instance of [[adjoint functors#Posets|adjunction]] (specifically, a [[Galois connection]]): the residuum forms a right adjoint R(''x'', –) to the functor T(–, ''x'') for each ''x'' in the lattice [0,&amp;nbsp;1] taken as a [[poset]] category.

In the standard semantics of t-norm based fuzzy logics, where conjunction is interpreted by a t-norm, the residuum plays the role of implication (often called ''R-implication'').

=== Basic properties of residua ===

If &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; is the residuum of a left-continuous t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = \sup\{z\mid\top(z,x) \le y\}.&lt;/math&gt;
Consequently, for all ''x'', ''y'' in the unit interval,
:&lt;math&gt;(x \Rightarrow y) = 1&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;x \le y&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;(1 \Rightarrow y) = y.&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is a left-continuous t-norm and &lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; its residuum, then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rcl}
  \min(x,y)  &amp; \ge &amp; x * (x \Rightarrow y) \\
  \max(x, y) &amp; =   &amp; \min((x \Rightarrow y)\Rightarrow y, (y \Rightarrow x)\Rightarrow x).
\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
If &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is continuous, then equality holds in the former.

=== Residua of prominent left-continuous t-norms ===

If ''x'' ≤ ''y'', then R(''x'', ''y'') = 1 for any residuum R. The following table therefore gives the values of prominent residua only for ''x'' &amp;gt; ''y''.

== T-conorms ==

'''T-conorms''' (also called '''S-norms''') are dual to t-norms under the order-reversing operation which assigns 1&amp;nbsp;– ''x'' to ''x'' on [0,&amp;nbsp;1]. Given a t-norm &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt;, the complementary conorm is defined by
: &lt;math&gt;\bot(a,b) = 1-\top(1-a, 1-b).&lt;/math&gt;
This generalizes [[De Morgan's laws]].

It follows that a t-conorm satisfies the following conditions, which can be used for an equivalent axiomatic definition of t-conorms independently of t-norms:
* Commutativity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') = ⊥(''b'', ''a'')
* Monotonicity: ⊥(''a'', ''b'') ≤ ⊥(''c'', ''d'') if ''a'' ≤ ''c'' and ''b'' ≤ ''d''
* Associativity: ⊥(''a'', ⊥(''b'', ''c'')) = ⊥(⊥(''a'', ''b''), ''c'')
* Identity element: ⊥(''a'', 0) = ''a''

T-conorms are used to represent [[logical disjunction]] in [[fuzzy logic]] and [[union (set theory)|union]] in [[fuzzy set theory]].

===Examples of t-conorms===

Important t-conorms are those dual to prominent t-norms:

[[File:MaximumTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the maximum t-conorm (3D and contours)]]
*'''Maximum t-conorm''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{max}}(a, b) = \max \{a, b\}&lt;/math&gt;, dual to the minimum t-norm, is the smallest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below). It is the standard semantics for disjunction in [[Gödel fuzzy logic]] and for weak disjunction in all t-norm based fuzzy logics.

[[File:ProbabilisticSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the probabilistic sum]]
*'''Probabilistic sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{sum}}(a, b) = a + b - a \cdot b&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the product t-norm. In [[probability theory]] it expresses the probability of the union of independent [[event (probability theory)|event]]s. It is also the standard semantics for strong disjunction in such extensions of [[product fuzzy logic]] in which it is definable (e.g., those containing involutive negation).

[[File:BoundedSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the bounded sum t-conorm]]
*'''Bounded sum''' &lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{Luk}}(a, b) = \min \{a+b, 1\}&lt;/math&gt; is dual to the Łukasiewicz t-norm. It is the standard semantics for strong disjunction in [[Łukasiewicz fuzzy logic]].

[[File:DrasticTconorm-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the drastic t-conorm. The function is discontinuous at the lines 1 &amp;gt; ''x'' = 0 and 1 &amp;gt; ''y'' = 0.]]
*'''Drastic t-conorm'''
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
  b &amp; \mbox{if }a=0 \\
  a &amp; \mbox{if }b=0 \\
  1 &amp; \mbox{otherwise,}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
:dual to the drastic t-norm, is the largest t-conorm (see the [[#Properties of t-conorms|properties of t-conorms]] below).

[[File:NilpotentMaximum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the nilpotent maximum. The function is discontinuous at the line 0 &amp;lt; ''x'' = 1 – ''y'' &amp;lt; 1.]]
*'''Nilpotent maximum''', dual to the nilpotent minimum:
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{nM}}(a, b) = \begin{cases}
    \max(a,b) &amp; \mbox{if }a+b &lt; 1 \\
    1         &amp; \mbox{otherwise.}
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

[[File:EinsteinSum-graph-contour.png|thumb|270px|Graph of the Einstein sum]]
*'''Einstein sum''' (compare the [[velocity-addition formula]] under special relativity)
::&lt;math&gt;\bot_{\mathrm{H}_2}(a, b) = \frac{a+b}{1+ab}&lt;/math&gt;
:is a dual to one of the [[Construction of t-norms#Hamacher t-norms|Hamacher t-norms]].

===Properties of t-conorms===

Many properties of t-conorms can be obtained by dualizing the properties of t-norms, for example:
* For any t-conorm ⊥, the number 1 is an annihilating element: ⊥(''a'', 1) = 1, for any ''a'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].
* Dually to t-norms, all t-conorms are bounded by the maximum and the drastic t-conorm:
::&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\bot_{max}}(a, b) \le \bot(a, b) \le \bot_{\mathrm{D}}(a, b)&lt;/math&gt;, for any t-conorm &lt;math&gt;\bot&lt;/math&gt; and all ''a'', ''b'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1].

Further properties result from the relationships between t-norms and t-conorms or their interplay with other operators, e.g.:
* A t-norm T [[distributivity|distributes]] over a t-conorm ⊥, i.e.,
::T(''x'', ⊥(''y'', ''z'')) = ⊥(T(''x'', ''y''), T(''x'', ''z'')) for all ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' in [0,&amp;nbsp;1],
:if and only if ⊥ is the maximum t-conorm. Dually, any t-conorm distributes over the minimum, but not over any other t-norm.

===Non-standard negators===

A '''negator''' &lt;math&gt;n:[0,1] \to [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Monotonic function#Monotonicity in functional analysis|monotonous]] falling, i. e. order-reversion mapping with &lt;math&gt;n(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n(1) = 0&lt;/math&gt; (in other notation: &lt;math&gt;0 \mapsto 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;1 \mapsto 0&lt;/math&gt;). 
A negator n is called
* '''strict''' in case of strict monotonocity 
* '''strong''' if it is strict and involutive (see: [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]): [[Universal quantification#notation|&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt;]] &lt;math&gt;x \in [0,1]: n(n(x)) = x&lt;/math&gt;.
The standard (canonical) negator is 
&lt;math&gt;n(x) = 1 - x, x \in [0, 1]&lt;/math&gt;, 
which appears to be strong. As the standard negator is used in the above definition of a t-norm/t-conorm pair, this can be generalized as follows:

A '''De Morgan Triplet''' is a triple (T,⊥,n) [[iff]] (if and only if)
# T is a t-norm
# ⊥ is a t-conorm according to the axiomatic definition of t-conorms as mentioned above
# n is a strong negator
# &lt;math&gt;\forall a,b \in [0, 1]: \,n(\perp(a, b)) = T(n(a), n(b))&lt;/math&gt;.

{{Italic title}}
'''''Thought-Forms: A Record of Clairvoyant Investigation''''' is a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] book compiled by the members of the [[Theosophical Society Adyar|Theosophical Society]] [[Annie Besant|A. Besant]] and [[Charles Webster Leadbeater|C. W. Leadbeater]]. It was originally published in 1901 in London.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1566}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=248}} From the standpoint of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], it tells regarding visualization of thoughts, experiences, emotions and music. Drawings of the "thought-forms" were performed by painters Varley, Prince, and McFarlane.{{sfnm|Gettings|1978|1p=136|Tillett|1986|2p=224}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Vladimir Trefilov|Trefilov]], Theosophy, unlike an academic science, "views the whole world as a manifestation of thought in all categories of matter. [[Occultism|Occult science]] know about the existence of higher types of rarefied matter. Man is in no way limited by the physical world alone."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=234}} [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan|Radhakrishnan]] wrote, "There are [[Plane (esotericism)|other worlds]] than that which our senses reveal to us, [[clairvoyance|other senses]] than those which we share with the lower animals, other forces than those of material nature."{{sfn|Radhakrishnan|2008|p=373}} Thus, it is necessary to develop the "new senses" in order to "perceive thought-forms."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=117}} Academic science explains the visualization of sensations of a mentally healthy person by a phenomenon of the [[synesthesia]].{{sfn|Britannica}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
This book has become the result of the joint work of the authors, which began in 1895, when they had started an investigation of "the subtle matter of the universe."{{sfn|Wessinger}} They were interested the work of the human mind as, according their claim, this work "extrudes into the external world" the thought-forms.{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

In September 1896, Besant reported in [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'']] that "two clairvoyant Theosophists" (whose personalities were not disclosed in the journal, although some members of the Society knew about them) had started "observing the substance of thought." Her article named ''Thought-Forms''{{refn|group=note|Leadbeater does not appear here as a co-author of Besant, nevertheless, according to [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]], after [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky's]] death, it was he who became the main ideologist of the "second generation" of the Theosophists.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=509}}}} was accompanied by four pages of pictures of diverse thought-forms which the investigators "had observed and described to an artist."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}{{refn|group=note|A tradition of "seeing thoughts" already existed in [[spiritualism]]. Dr. Baraduc, a famous French psychiatrist, had informed the "Acadamie de Medecine" in 1896 that he had succeeded to photograph thoughts.{{sfn|Melton|2001b|p=1565}}{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=990}}}} The colour sketches of the unknown performance were depicting: on the first plate—thought-forms of "devotion," "sacrifice," and "devotional," on the second one—three types of "anger," on the third one—three types of "love" ("undirected," "directed," and "grasping"), and on the fourth one—thought-forms of "jealousy," "intellect," and "ambition."{{sfn|Index}} Besant gave the article scientific coloring, not forgetting to mention [[Wilhelm Röntgen|Röntgen]], Baraduc,{{sfn|Melton|2001a}} [[Carl Reichenbach|Reichenbach]], "vibrations and the ether."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}}

This "small but influential book",{{refn|group=note|According to the scholars of religious studies, the authors of the ''Encyclopedia of Women and Religion in North America.''{{sfn|Keller|2006}}}} which contains color pictures of thought-forms that the authors said are created "in subtle spirit-matter," was published in 1901. The book affirms that "the quality" of thoughts influences the life experience of their creator, and that they "can affect" other people.{{sfn|Keller|2006|p=755}}{{refn|group=note|As Leadbeater noted, "books are specially strong centres of thought-forms, and their unnoticed influence in a man's life is often a powerful one."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 15}}}}

== Basic concepts ==
=== Meaning of color ===
[[File:Colorchart.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Frontispiece. The meanings of colours.&lt;/center&gt;]]
The authors write that they, like many theosophists, are convinced that "thoughts are things," and the task of their book is to help the reader understand this.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=16}}{{refn|group=note|[[Gary Lachman|Lachman]] noted that it is "the central maxim of ''Thought-Forms.''"{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}} The frontispiece of the book contains a table "The meanings of colours" of thought-forms and [[Aura (paranormal)|human aura]] associated with feelings and emotions, beginning with "High Spirituality" (light blue—in the upper left corner) and ending by "Malice" (black—in the lower right corner), 25 colors in all.{{refn|group=note|See the frontispiece of ''Thought-Forms,'' 1901. For comparison, see table "Auric Colors and Their Meanings"{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|pp=64–66}} and Ch. "Colours."{{sfn|Powell|1927|loc=Ch. 3}}}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=29}}{{refn|group=note|"Every thought form bears the same color that it would possess if it had been retained in the body of the aura itself."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}} The authors argue that human aura is "the outer part of the cloud-like substance of his higher bodies, interpenetrating each other, and extending beyond the confines of his physical body."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=55}} The [[Mental body|mental]] and [[Astral body|desire]] bodies (two human higher bodies) are "those chiefly concerned with the appearance of what are called thought-forms."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=17|Johnston|2012|2p=158}}{{refn|group=note|[[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]] wrote that, according to theosophy, "auras may be made up of a complex combination of etheric, astral, and mental matter which the clairvoyant is able to perceive, although the most significant ones originate on the border of the mental and astral planes, where the activity of the former is reflected in the configurations of astral matter. When comparable patterns appear as a 'cloud' above or near a person, they may be called 'thought-forms' and as such have been reported in theosophical literature."{{sfn|Ellwood|1986|p=115}}}}{{refn|group=note|Thought-forms are created from the same matter from which the aura is formed, and have the same general properties, in particular, color. Knowledge of the properties of an aura of man is necessary for a proper "understanding of the nature of the thought-forms."{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=31}} According to Powell, the term "thought-forms" is "not wholly accurate," because in the overwhelming majority of cases they are being formed by both astral and mental bodies. It would be more correct to call them ''thought-emotion forms.''{{sfn|Powell|1927|pp=43, 55}} Gettings wrote that in studying the illustrations from this book "one cannot help observing that they do not really relate to thought so much as to feeling – they are really emotion forms rather than thought forms."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, "Whether or not there is scientific validity in claims about the aura, it remains significant that Leadbeater's descriptions (given initially in an article [''The Aura''] in ''[[The Theosophist]]'' in [December] 1895{{sfn|IndexT}}) have been more or less repeated by later researchers, both scientific and occult. The earliest scientific study of the aura [''The Human Atmosphere,'' 1911] was published by [[Walter John Kilner]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=953}}}}

=== Three principles and three classes ===
The book states that "the production of all thought-forms" is based on three major principles:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# Quality of thought determines colour.
# Nature of thought determines form.
# Definiteness of thought determines clearness of outline.{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=31|Писарева|2010|2p=29|Jones|2012|3p=54}}{{refn|group=note|[[Alice Bailey|Bailey]] has contraposed the "clear and well-defined, pulsating with the spirit of service" thought-forms of the initiated occultist with the "disjointed, unconnected, and uncorrelated" thought-forms created by the "mass of men."{{sfn|Bailey|2012|p=87}} As Powell wrote, many people go through life, literally tightly locked in their own cells, which they themselves have built, "surrounded by masses of forms created by their habitual thoughts."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=47}} Leadbeater noted later that most people can not free themselves from the influence "of the great crowd of thought-forms which constitute [preconceived] public opinion; and because of those they never really see the truth at all."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 10}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Thought-forms, or 'an artificial [[elemental]]s,' have a huge impact on the earthly life of people, performing certain functions depending on the desires and direction of the thought that created them."{{sfn|Трефилов|1994|p=237}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authors define the following three classes of thought-forms:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# That which takes the image of the thinker. When a man thinks of himself as in some distant place, or wishes earnestly to be in that place, he makes a thought-form in his own image which appears there.
# That which takes the image of some material object. [The painter who forms a conception of his future picture builds it up out of the matter of his mental body, and then projects it into space in front of him, keeps it before his mind's eye, and copies it. The novelist in the same way builds images of his character in mental matter, and by the exercise of his will moves these puppets from one position or grouping to another, so that the plot of his story is literally acted out before him.]{{refn|group=note|A comparison of the thought-forms of literary heroes with marionettes, Leadbeater repeated in 1913 in his next Theosophical book.{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 6}}}}
# That which takes a form entirely its own,{{refn|group=note|Pisareva wrote that the thought-forms belonged to this category may be named the "symbolic forms."{{sfn|Писарева|2010|p=27}}}} expressing its inherent qualities in the matter which it draws round it. [Those of which we here give specimens are almost wholly of that class.]{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=36|Писарева|2010|2p=26}}{{sfn|Harris}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Examples of thought-forms ==
[[File:Form16.jpg|thumb|left|160px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 16. Self-Renunciation.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=44}}{{refn|group=note|It's like "a pale blue lotus."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Blue color expresses "spirituality."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=66}} "A thought of definite, well-sustained devotion may assume a form closely resembling a flower."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=57}} The more purified desires and thoughts of man, the more "radiant and beautiful" are his thought-forms which he create.{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
"To paint in earth's dull colours the forms clothed in the living light of other worlds, — Besant writes in the foreword, — is a hard and thankless task." The authors claim that the images in the book "are not imaginary forms, prepared as some dreamer thinks that they ought to appear." Rather, "they
are representations of forms actually observed as thrown off by ordinary men and women." And the authors sincerely hope that they will force the reader "realise the nature and power of his thoughts, acting as a stimulus to the noble, a curb on the base."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1pp=6, 39|Breen|2014|2p=110}}

The authors write that a form in Fig. 19 at the top is a specific thought-form which had accompanied a question demonstrating deep thought and penetration. The first variant of the answer did not fully satisfy the questioner, and his desire to achieve a full and comprehensive answer was expressed in the fact that his "thought-form deepened in colour and changed into the second of the two shapes (in Fig. 19 below), resembling a corkscrew even more closely than before."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=51}}{{refn|group=note|[[Curuppumullage Jinarajadasa|Jinarajadasa]] informed that on his question to Leadbeater "when he saw this curious shape" he answered that it is a creation of Mr. [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|Sinnett]], "who tried to 'worm' things out of him, when he appeared to be holding back some knowledge which Mr. Sinnett wanted."{{sfn|Jinarajadasa|2003}}}}{{refn|group=note|"Orange, of a bright shade, represents pride and ambition.

Fig. 22 and 23 are thought-forms of a "murderous rage" (on the right) and a "sustained anger" (on the left). The first form was taken "from the aura of a rough and partially intoxicated man in the [[East End]] of London," when he was knocking down a woman; a flare flashed in her direction, triggering an explosion of horror—she recognized that one would be struck. In the same illustration drawned a "stiletto-like dart" directed to the lower left corner: it is a thought "of steady anger, intense and desiring vengeance, of the quality of murder, sustained through years, and directed against a person who had inflicted a deep injury on the one who sent it forth."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=53}}{{refn|group=note|Tillett has seen on the left "a bright red spike."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=224}} Sustained anger takes the form of "a sharp, red stiletto."{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=58}} The thought-form of anger has a color of black and red, with characteristic flares.{{sfn|Atkinson|2011|p=34}}}}{{refn|group=note|Red color seen in the form of bright red flares like the lightning flash shows anger.

The authors state that when a person is suddenly frightened, then has a place the effect shown in Fig. 27. It is emphasized that "all the crescents" on the right, which apparently have been emitted earlier than others, do not show anything other than "the livid grey of fear; but a moment later the man is already partially recovering from the shock, and beginning to feel angry that he allowed himself to be startled." The later crescents have changed to scarlet, and it evidences the "mingling of anger and fear," while the last crescent is quite scarlet, and it shows that "already the fright is entirely overcome, and only the annoyance remains."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=55}}{{refn|group=note|According to Tillett, here you can see "a cloud of red-grey crescents."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=225}} Gray color of a specific shade, "almost that of a corpse", demonstrates "fear and terror."

Beginning from Fig. 30, "the book changes course in an interesting way," moving from the illustrations of individual thoughts and emotions to the narrative of events.{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=111–112}} Besant and Leadbeater write that occasioned by a "terrible accident" at sea, three thought-forms depicted in Fig. 30 "were seen simultaneously, arranged exactly as represented, though in the midst of indescribable confusion." The authors continue:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"They are instructive as showing how differently people are affected by sudden and serious danger. One form [on the right] shows nothing but an eruption of the livid grey of fear, rising out of a basis of utter selfishness: and unfortunately there were many such as this. The shattered appearance of the thought-form shows the violence and completeness of the explosion, which in turn indicates that the whole soul of that person was possessed with blind, frantic terror, and that the overpowering sense of personal danger excluded for the time every higher feeling."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=57|Breen|2014|2p=112}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Form30.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Fig. 30.

The authors explain that the thought-form in Fig. 30 on the left shows an attempt to find "solace in prayer," and in this way overcome fear. This can be seen under a grayish-blue color, "which lifts itself hesitatingly upwards." Yet it is seen that judging by "the lower part of the thought-form, with its irregular outline and its falling fragments, that there is in reality almost as much fright here" as in the case on the right. Thus, one person has a chance to restore "self-control," while the other remains "an abject slave to overwhelming emotion." The thought-form at upper has been created by a member of the ship crew responsible for the lives of passengers, and it demonstrates a "very striking contrast" of the weakness manifesting in two forms from below. Herein shown "a powerful, clear-cut and definite thought, obviously full" of energy and determination. Orange color speaks of his confidence in ability to manage with the difficulty. The "brilliant yellow" means that his intellect is already at work upon the problem.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=57}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color of a specific shade demonstrates "fear and terror."

Fig. 31 is another declarative piece, depicting "the thought-form of an actor while waiting to go upon the stage." The authors expound that the orange band indicates self-confidence,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"yet in spite of this there is a good deal of unavoidable uncertainty as to how this new play may strike the fickle public, and on the whole the doubt and fear overbalance the certainty and pride, for there is more of the pale grey than of the orange, and the whole thought-form vibrates like a flag flapping in a gale of wind." {{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=59|Breen|2014|2p=112}}{{refn|group=note|Gray color represents fear.

In the thought-form on the left in Fig. 34, as the authors explain, there is nothing but "the highest and most beautiful" feelings. At the base of the thought-form, you can see "a full expression of deep sympathy," the light green color shows the understanding of the suffering of the deceased's relatives and condolence with them, and the strip "of deeper green shows the attitude of the thinker towards the dead man himself." The dense rose-color shows love to both the deceased and the surrounding, while the upper part, consisting of a cone and stars above it, indicates a feeling in connection with thoughts of death: the blue express "its devotional aspect," while as "the violet shows the thought of, and the power to respond to, a noble ideal" and the ability to match, the stars reflect "the spiritual aspirations."{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|According to Gettings, the thought-form to the left is a spiritual one "which was a result of the highest meditation in the face of the loss of the loved one."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "Pale, luminous blue-green" shows deep sympathy and compassion. "Luminous lilac-blue, usually accompanied by sparkling golden stars" is associated with a high level of spirituality and noble aspirations. Rose color expresses selfless love.{{sfn|Powell|1927|p=12}}}} In the same figure, the thought-form on the right reflects nothing but only "profound depression, fear and selfishness." His only definite feelings are despair and the sense of his personal loss, and these show themselves in proper strips of brown-grey and leaden grey color, while the "very curious downward protrusion" demonstrates the strong selfish desire to raise the dead man into his earth life.{{sfn|TForms|1901|p=62}}{{refn|group=note|Dark gray color represents "depression and melancholy."{{sfn|Ramacharaka|2007|p=64}}}}{{refn|group=note|Gettings wrote that the form to the right demonstrates a distress of the materialist forming from the mind of one "who is unable to accept that death is a liberation into a higher world, and the proboscis-like feeler which runs from the base of this thought form is said to be reaching into the grave, as if to bring back the dead body."{{sfn|Gettings|1987|p=47}} "The man who had lived in the ordinary blank ignorance with regard to death, had no thought in connection with it but selfish fear and depression; whereas the man who understood the facts was entirely free from any suggestion of those feelings, for the only sentiments evoked in him were those of sympathy and affection for the mourners, and of devotion and high aspiration."{{sfn|Leadbeater|2007|loc=Ch. 11}}}}

The description of the event depicted in the book on Fig. 38, as noted a historian Breen, "anticipates the 1960s" as well with its conjunction of meditation and idealism: this thought-form was "generated by one who was trying, while sitting in [[meditation]], to fill his mind with an aspiration to enfold all mankind in order to draw them upward towards the high ideal which shone so clearly before his eyes."{{sfnm|TForms|1901|1p=67|Breen|2014|2p=113}} The ability of the authors to see the "vibrations of ideas, emotions,  and sounds" demonstrates, in his opinion, "a sort of [[spirit]]ual [[synesthesia]]" which transform the religious act into a [[Neurology|neurological]] phenomenon.{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=110}}

Plate M showing the form created by music of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] "depicts yellow, red, blue and green lines rising out of a church."

According to professor [[Robert Ellwood|Ellwood]], the book by Besant and Leadbeater had a large influence on [[modern art]]. "It suggested, to a world moving rapidly beyond the literalism of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] art, the expression in painting of [[Surrealism|surreal]] forms and forces underlying, but different from, the visible world."{{sfn|Ellwood}} ''Thought-Forms'' demonstrated how the symbolism of "astral colors and forms" can express the specificity of "certain soul's and mental states." It had a great influence on [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]{{sfn|Kramer|1995}}{{sfn|Lachman|2008}}{{refn|group=note|The ideas which Kandinsky "elaborated in numerous notes and articles, including the now iconic text ''On the Spiritual in Art,'' were a combination of Besant and Leadbeater's theories on thought-forms, [[Rudolf Steiner|Steiner's]] considerations of colour, music, and vibration, [and] theories about synaesthesia."{{sfn|Johnston|2012|p=159}} Kandinsky "owned a German translation" (1908 edition) of the book ''Thought-Forms.''{{sfn|Gettings|1978|p=135}}}} as one of the essential factors that led to the "genius opening of new perspectives for painting."{{sfn|Бычков|2007|p=83}}{{refn|group=note|According to Lachman, one Kandinsky's painting in which the "influence of ''Thought-Forms'' is quite visible" is [http://www.wassilykandinsky.ru/work-186.php ''Woman in Moscow'' (1912).]{{sfn|Lachman|2008}} Also one of Kandinsky's paintings "is similar" to the musical form from the book of Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Alvarenga|2011}}}}{{refn|group=note|According to Jones, two Leadbeater's books are "relevant to [[František Kupka|Kupka's]] search for the immaterial: ''Clairvoyance'' (1899) and ''Thought-Forms'' (1901), co-written with Besant."{{sfn|Jones|2012|p=51}}}}

According to reminiscences by [[Leonid Sabaneyev|Sabaneyev]], besides ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' [[Alexander Scriabin|Scriabin]] interested a magazine ''Vestnik Theosofii,'' which published [from 1908] the translations of Besant and Leadbeater's works.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=63}}{{sfn|Архив ВТ}} Apparently, being impressed by theirs theosophical works, he once said that "strong, powerful thought creates a thought-form so intense that it, in addition to the will, flows into the consciousness of other people."{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=307}}{{refn|group=note|According to an Ukrainian philosopher Julia Shabanova, a book ''Thought-Forms'' was being "discussed" by Alexander Scriabin and [[Jean Delville]], a Belgian [[symbolist]] painter.{{sfn|Шабанова}}}} The perform of the [[Part (music)|part]] of light in [[Prometheus: The Poem of Fire|''Prometheus'']] he imagined in the form of a radiance of some "luminous matter," which was supposed to fill the hall.{{sfn|Сабанеев|2000|p=70}}{{refn|group=note|"Scriabin introduced many Theosophical ideas into his compositions and also experimented with 'synesthesia,' the strange experience of 'hearing colors' and 'seeing music'."{{sfn|Lachman|2002}}}}{{refn|group=note|See also: [[Clavier à lumières]]}}

A historian Breen wrote that Besant and Leadbeater were well aware how annoying stuff may be their book for a "society that remained deeply conservative." In early January 1901, when this book was published, "[[Queen Victoria]] still ruled England. '[[Modernism]]' as a movement or even a concept did not exist. When we consider this world of 1901, – further wrote Breen, – it becomes difficult not to believe that Besant, Leadbeater and their milieu deserve a more prominent place in the annals of both abstract art and the history of modernism." As the art critic [[Hilton Kramer|Kramer]] has pointed, "what is particularly striking about the outlook of the artists primarily responsible for creating [[Abstract art|abstraction]] is their espousal of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|occult doctrine]]."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=113}} [[W. B. Yeats|Yeats]], [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Kazimir Malevich|Malevich]], Kandinsky, and [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]] were charmed by Theosophy.{{refn|group=note|[[Max Beckmann|Beckmann]] who was "impressed" by the book ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]'' he read in 1934 made several different sketches "on the theme" of its second volume ''Anthropogenesis.'' The album with these sketches is in the Washington [[National Gallery of Art|National Gallery]].{{sfn|Бычков|2009|p=171}}}} In the first decades of the twentieth century, it was a widespread "component of Western cultural life."{{sfn|Breen|2014|pp=113–114}}{{refn|group=note|"[[J.

Thus, Besant and Ledbetter had played, summed up Breen, "a small but intriguing role in shaping the globalized culture... which weaves together [[Eastern world|East]] and [[Western world|West]], mysticism and rationalism, sound and sight."{{sfn|Breen|2014|p=114}}{{refn|group=note|According to [[Albert Goldman|Goldman]], [[Elvis Presley|Presley]] interested the books by Blavatsky "and those of her disciples" Besant and Leadbeater.{{sfn|Goldman|1981|p=366}} Leadbeater's ''Inner Life'' has belonged to his favourite books, and he often read from it "aloud before going on stage to perform."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=10}}}}{{See also|Synesthesia#Art}}

'''Transculturation''' is a term coined by Cuban anthropologist [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] in 1947&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf Ortiz 1995], pp. v, 97&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the phenomenon of merging and converging cultures.

Transculturation encompasses more than transition from one culture to another; it does not consist merely of acquiring another culture (acculturation) or of losing or uprooting a previous culture (deculturation).  Rather, it merges these concepts and additionally carries the idea of the consequent creation of new cultural phenomena (neoculturation).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ortiz|1995|pp=102–103|url=http://www.personal.psu.edu/users/s/a/sam50/readings521/ORTIZ_Counter-Engl.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz also referred to the devastating impact of Spanish colonialism on Cuba's indigenous peoples as a "failed transculturation". Transculturation can often be the result of colonial conquest and subjugation, especially in a postcolonial era as native peoples struggle to regain their own sense of identity.

In simple terms, transculturation reflects the natural tendency of people (in general) to resolve conflicts over time, rather than exacerbating them.  (In the modern context, both conflicts and resolutions are amplified by communication and transportation technology—the ancient tendency of cultures drifting or remaining apart has been replaced by stronger forces for bringing societies together.) Where transculturation impacts ethnicity and ethnic issues the term "ethnoconvergence" is sometimes used.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

In one general sense, transculturation covers [[war]], [[ethnic conflict]], [[racism]], [[multiculturalism]], [[cross-culturalism]], [[interracial marriage]], and any other of a number of contexts that deal with more than one culture.  In the other general sense, transculturation is one aspect of global phenomena and human events.

The general processes of transculturation are extremely complex—steered by powerful forces at the macrosocial level, yet ultimately resolved at the interpersonal level. The driving force for conflict is simple [[Proxemics|proximity]]—boundaries, once separating people (providing for a measure of isolation) become the issue of a conflict when societies encroach upon one another territorially.  If a means to co-exist cannot be immediately found, then conflicts can be hostile, leading to a process by which contact between individuals leads to some resolution. Often, history shows us, the processes of co-existence begins with hostilities, and with the natural passing of polarist individuals, comes the passing of their polarist sentiments, and soon some resolution is achieved.  Degrees of hostile conflict vary from outright genocidal conquest, to lukewarm infighting between differing political views within the same ethnic community.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

These changes often represent differences between homeland pons, and their [[diasporic]] communities abroad. Nevertheless, obstacles to '''ethnoconvergence''' are not great. The primary issue; [[language]], (''hence, communication and education'') can be overcome within a single generation—as is evident in the easy acclimation of children of foreign parents.  English, for example, is spoken by more non-Anglo-American people than Anglo-Americans, making it the current [[lingua-franca]], the worldwide de facto standard international language.

Processes of transculturation become more complex within the context of [[globalization]], given the multiple layers of abstraction that permeate everyday experiences. Elizabeth Kath argues that in the global era we can no longer consider transculturation only in relation to the face-to-face, but that we need to take into account the many layers of abstracted interactions that are interwoven through face-to-face encounters, a phenomenon that she describes as ''layers of transculturation''.&lt;ref&gt;Kath, Elizabeth (2015) [http://www.rowmaninternational.com/books/narratives-of-globalization "On Transculturation: Re-enacting and Remaking Latin Dance and Music in Foreign Lands"] In Julian Lee (Ed) ''Narratives of Globalization: Reflections on the Global Condition.''  Rowman &amp; Littlefield International&lt;/ref&gt; Kath draws upon the concept of constitutive abstraction as seen in the work of Australian social theorists Geoff Sharp&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, Geoff (1993) "Extended Forms of the Social", ''Arena,'' 1&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]].&lt;ref&gt;James, Paul (1996) ''Nation Formation: Towards a Theory of Abstract Community,'' SAGE&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Emotional Ambivalence Across Times and Spaces: Mapping Petrarch's Intersecting Worlds|last = James|first = Paul|date = 2014|journal = Exemplaria|volume = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Homogenization versus ethnoconvergence==

It has been observed that even in monolingual, industrial societies like urban North America, some individuals do cling to a "modernized" primordial identity, apart from others. Some intellectuals, such as [[Michael Ignatieff]], argue that convergence of a general culture does not directly entail a similar convergence in [[ethnic]] identities. This can become evident in social situations, where people divide into separate groups, despite being of an identical "super-ethnicity", such as [[nationality]].

Within each smaller ethnicity, individuals may tend to see it perfectly justified to assimilate with other cultures, and some others view assimilation as wrong and incorrect for their culture. This common theme, representing dualist opinions of ethnoconvergence itself, within a single ethnic group is often manifested in issues of [[sexual partner]]s and [[marriage]], employment preferences, etc. These varied opinions of ethnoconvergence represent themselves in a spectrum; [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[wikt:homogeneous|homogenization]], [[acculturation]], and [[cultural compromise]] are commonly used terms for ethnoconvegence which flavor the issues to a bias.

Often it's in a secular, multi-ethnic environment that cultural concerns are both minimised and exacerbated; Ethnic prides are boasted, hierarchy is created ("center" culture versus "periphery") but on the other hand, they will still share a common "culture", and common language and behaviours. Often the elderly, more conservative-in-association of a clan, tend to reject cross-cultural associations, and participate in ethnically similar community-oriented activities. [[Xenophobia|Xenophobes]] tend to think of cross-cultural contact as a component of assimilation, and see this as harmful.

==Obstacles to ethnoconvergence==

The obstacle to ethnoconvergence is [[ethnocentrism]], which is the view that one's culture is of greater importance than another's. Ethnocentrism often takes different forms, as it is a highly personal bias, and manifests itself in countless aspects of culture. [[Religion]], or belief, is the prime ethnocentric divider. Second is [[convention (norm)|custom]], which may overlap religion. With the adherence to each distinct component, comes the repulsion of the other. In most regions, ethnic divides are binary, meaning only two distinct cultures are present, each seeing the other as foreign. Many, however make the point that the binary example is the exception, and the norm is far more dynamic.

Ethnicity can be divided into two distinct areas, as they relate to ethnoconvergence:  Utilitarian traits, and traditional customs.

Religion, on the other hand, is a highly personal and attached part of culture. However, religion does not neatly correspond with ethnic identity. In many [[Multicultural|cosmopolitan]] societies, religion is everything—social, utilitarian, intellectual, political; from the point of view of people of immersed cultures; The very concept of ethnicity and its distinctions is incongruous to their immersed concepts.

In many societies, such as in those in Europe, languages are considered a significant component of ethnic values. This does not mean that most Europeans reject learning other languages. Quite the contrary, Europeans are often polyglots, and may label other individuals by their ethnicities; practical means of distinguishing cultures may resemble tendencies similar to ethnocentrism.

However, the political and cultural significance of regional or national languages are retained because these polyglots conform to the linguistic norms of the place they visit—doing "as the Romans do". Thus, conforming to the "ethnic integrity" of the region.

It has even become a cliché that "to learn a new language is to adopt a new soul". There are many other examples of the essential significance of language. In pre-[[Russia]]n [[Siberia]], [[Siberian Tatars|Tatar-Mongol]] colonists in the [[Taiga]] often recognized indigenous speakers of [[Turkic languages]] as their "own people" and non-Turkic groups as "foreigners", despite these indigenous groups having a similar level of material culture, and sharing much of a primitive culture with tribes foreign to the Muslim-Buddhist Tatar-Mongols.

==Transcultural communications==

In October 2011, U.S. communications agency [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] launched a new model/[[strategy]] utilizing transcultural [[sociological]] theory as a means to segment and 'make sense' of the changing [[United States|American]] cultural landscape. Returning to classic social science as a solution, [[Bromley Originate Change|Bromley]] has embraced the anthropological approach put forward by thinkers like [[Fernando Ortiz Fernández|Fernando Ortiz]] as a way to account for ethnicity and language without being limited by them as a way for viewing the world.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8382">'''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries''' (or '''TNTC''') is a series of commentaries in English on the [[New Testament]]. It is published by the [[Inter-Varsity Press]].

Constantly being revised since its first being completed, the series seek to bridge the gap between brevity and scholarly comment.

==Reviews==
{{quote|The ''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries'' are designed for the frequently-targeted well-read layperson, but many pastors profit as well. The series is conservative but focuses most attention on explaining the meaning of the text with minimal interaction with the voluminous secondary literature. Originally based on the AV/KJV, with Greek and Hebrew transliterated and explained, the series is being rewritten based on the RSV or NIV (at the individual author's discretion), and space is being assigned more equitably. Several of the volumes of this new edition are, within the constraints of the series, outstanding (e.g., Marshall on Acts). |[[D. A.

[[File:Wistarburg sign.jpg|thumb|Wistarburg Glass Works roadsign]]
The ''' Wistarburg Glass Works ''' (sometimes spelled '''Wistarburgh Glass Works'''; also known as the ''' United Glass Company''') was the first successful glass factory and  [[joint venture|joint-venture]] enterprise in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], referred to as Colonial America. [[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] founded the glass works company in 1739. He began by recruiting experienced glass artisans from Europe, and built homes for the workers along with a mansion for the factory's foreman. Wistar also had a [[company store]] built near the factory.

The village that developed around the factory adopted Wistar's name, and became known as Wistarburg. The village was in [[Salem County, New Jersey]], in the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]]. Wistar's factory produced thousands of glass bottles per year, as well as [[flat glass|window glass]]. Wistar was a friend of [[Benjamin Franklin]], and made glass globes for Franklin's electricity-producing machines used for scientific research. Wistar's son inherited the business and his son, Wistar's grandson, eventually gained control of the company, but owing to his mismanagement it closed.

==Company foundation==
[[Caspar Wistar (glassmaker)|Caspar Wistar]] (1696–1752) emigrated from the [[Palatinate (region)|Palitinate region of Germany]] to Philadelphia in 1717. There he began making brass buttons, which he would take with him on sales visits to [[Salem County, New Jersey]]. On one such trip he noticed that the township of [[Alloway Township, New Jersey|Alloway]] had an abundant supply of the necessary materials for glass manufacture&amp;nbsp;– white sand, clay, wood, and accessible waterways of the nearby [[Deep Run (Alloway Creek)|Deep Run]] and [[Alloway Creek]] rivers for transporting raw materials in and finished products out. He was thus encouraged to establish a glass factory there.&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |first1=J. Victor |last1=Owen |publisher=Historical American Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Pierce|1960|page=97}} Wistar's was not the first to be built in colonial America. Earlier establishments had been setup at [[Jamestown, Virginia]], in 1607 and 1621. They were founded to export glass items to England, but ultimately failed, having produced little, if any, glass.&lt;ref name=JamestownGlassmaking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nps.gov/jame/learn/historyculture/glassmaking-at-jamestown.htm |title=Glassmaking at Jamestown |work=Historic Jamestowne |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar's button-making business proved to be a success, and together with his gains from speculating in land allowed him to accumulate sufficient capital to fund a new enterprise. He began his glass-making venture in 1737 by buying {{convert|2000|acres}} of land about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} from [[Salem, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=CreekLocation&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/ |title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 / Factory Operations |date=2015 |website= |publisher=WheatonArts |access-date=July 22, 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commenced construction of his factory&amp;nbsp;– which became the first commercially successful glass factory in America.{{sfn|Davidson|Stillinger|1985|page=251}}{{sfn|Cantele|Kaplan|2010|page=275}} He arranged in January 1738 to lease {{convert|50|acres|ha}} of land containing {{convert|18000|cord}} of wood from John Ladd, a local landowner.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=155}} Wistar then recruited four experienced glass makers from the Palitinate region of Germany&amp;nbsp;– C. Halter, S. Griessmeyer, J. Wentzel, and J. Halter&amp;nbsp;– to make the factory operational. He organized a joint venture with them, dividing profits in exchange for the art of glass making. The four artisans were to teach this art to the Wistars and nobody else in the colonies.&lt;ref name=Cradle&gt;{{cite news |last=Cunningham |first=John T. |date=July 2, 1964 |title=Cradle of American Glass |url= https://www.newspapers.com/clip/17268234/|work=Bernardsville News |location= Bernardsville, New Jersey |via=[[Newspapers.com]] {{open access}} }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wistar had arranged for their journey to America, and they arrived in Philadelphia from [[Rotterdam]] on the ship ''Two Sisters'' in September 1738.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=164-167}}{{efn|There are no historical records that tell whether the two Halters were related.&lt;ref name=related&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wheatonarts.org/7926-2/past-exhibitions/1987-to-1989-exhibitions/1989-the-wistars-and-their-glass-1739-1777/|title=The Wistars and their Glass 1739–1777 |date=2017 |publisher=Wheaton Arts and cultural center |access-date=February 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Wistar had houses built near the factory to rent for the key artisans and other workers that were usually [[Indentured servitude|indentured immigrants]].{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=169}} He also had a mansion constructed for the factory's foreman, which also served as a lodging and office for Wistar while on his visits to the factory from his home in Philadelphia. A [[company store]] was constructed for the workers' needs. Products could be purchased on credit against the glass a worker would make in the future; a bookkeeper was employed to keep track of the store accounts and housing rents. The store also served the people of the village of Alloway, and was the center of community life.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}}

==Joint venture==
Wistar entered into a [[profit sharing|profit-sharing]] arrangement with the four German artisans who had helped to make his new factory operational. To ensure their continuing support he set up a [[joint venture]] between five members, the first cooperative manufacturing joint-venture business in America and the first long-term successful glasshouse. The 1739 company began trading as the United Glass Company, which consisted of three individual joint ventures. Wistar was the general manager and primary share holder, with a two-thirds majority ownership in each of the joint ventures.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=165}} The four Germans held one-third ownership and shared the expenses, assets, and profits of the three individual joint ventures. The first entity under the umbrella enterprise was held between Wistar and Wentzel, the second between Wistar and C. Halter, and the third between Wistar, Griesmeyer and J. Halter. The joint venture arrangement remained in effect until Wistar's death in 1752.&lt;ref name="Owen"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CMG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cmog.org/artwork/bottle-seal-richard-wistar |title=Bottle with the Seal of Richard Wistar |publisher=Corning Museum of Glass |access-date=July 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GlassHouse&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.peachridgeglass.com/2013/09/the-united-glass-company-located-at-wistarburgh/ |publisher=Peachridge Glass |title=The United Glass Company located at Wistarburg |date=September 24, 2013 |first2=Ferdinand, V, |last2=Meyer |first1=Stephen |last1=Atkinson |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HAG&gt;{{cite web |url=http://historical-american-glass.com/wistarburgh-glass.html |title= The United Glass Company located at Wistarburgh|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=A History of  Early American made Glass |publisher=Historical American Glass |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Franklin machine globe.jpg|thumb|Glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Benjamin Franklin's electrostatic machines]] were made by Wistarburg Glass Works.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}}]]
Wistar's factory produced about 15,000 glass bottles per year made in the [[Waldglas]] style, which had been a way of making glass in Europe since the Middle Ages. It was an inexpensive traditional method whereby the main materials of wood ash and sand produced a greenish-yellow glass. The factory produced window glass and was the first American supplier for the thirteen colonies.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=94}} The Glass House (as it was often called) also produced rum flasks and tableware.{{sfn|Time Inc|1955|p=58}} Wistar had unlimited access to white [[silica sand]], as well as other necessary materials, and the company's success was further aided by New Jersey's low taxation; Wistar was easily able to obtain more assets for the business.&lt;ref name=lowtaxes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://immigrantentrepreneurship.org/entry.php?rec=1 |title=Caspar Wistar established the first successful glass manufacturing business in North America |last1=Kummer|first1=Insa |date=2014 |website=Immigrant Entrepreneurship |publisher=[[German Historical Institute]] |access-date=July 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wistar lived in Philadelphia, and was aware that the British did not allow the manufacture of certain items that were in competition with those imported from Britain. He therefore downplayed the profits from his glass business, so as to avoid arousing the suspicions of the British. Wistar ran his business affairs from Philadelphia, spending little time in Alloway. He sold the manufactured glass products through his store in Philadelphia, the Wistarburg company store, and his son Richard's store in New York City.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}}

Wistar was friends with [[Benjamin Franklin]] of Philadelphia and made glass globes for [[Franklin's electrostatic machine|Franklin's electricity producing machines]], used for scientific research into electricity.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=65}} Franklin built several of his machines, using the Wistarburg glass globes, for [[Cadwallader Colden]] and [[Lewis Evans (surveyor)|Lewis Evans]], for which they paid him between ten and twelve pounds each.{{sfn|Lemay|2014|page=75}} The Wistarburg Glass Works also made glass tubes for [[David Rittenhouse]] to use in his experiments on electricity.{{sfn|Davis|2012|p=27}}

Wistar died of [[dropsy]] in Philadelphia on March 21, 1752,{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=170}} and his son Richard took over the glass works. Richard also mostly ran the business from Philadelphia, but worked on increasing sales and expanding the company's product range. Just like his father, he relied on hired artisans to run the glass works factory in Alloway. The glass enterprise continued into the 1770s, but struggled owing to deforestation around Wistarburg. Wood from the trees was needed as fuel to run the glass furnaces, and when supplies began to run short some of the company's key artisans resigned and went to start their own glass company in [[Glassboro, New Jersey]], where there were new uncut forests and plenty of wood. Richard also had personal problems that occupied much of his time, and financial difficulties caused by the Revolutionary War; in an attempt to make ends meet, he sold a major portion of his father's New Jersey real estate.{{sfn|Veit|2014|p=100}} Richard died in 1781, and his son John took over the business. John failed to devote the effort necessary to run the glass works, allowing it to go into serious decline and ultimately it went out of business. The final year of the enterprise is disputed by scholars, but it is known that in 1793 the property that the factory was on was divided up among Richard's heirs and sold in parcels.{{sfn|Beiler|2008|page=156}}

'''Zellige''' ({{IPA-ar|zˈliʑ|lang}}; {{lang-ar|الزليج}}; also '''zelige''' or '''zellij''') is mosaic [[tile]]work made from individually chiseled geometric tiles set into a [[plaster]] base.&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Opinion]] (May 6, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This form of [[Islamic art]] is one of the main characteristics of [[Moroccan architecture]]. It consists of [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometrically patterned]] [[mosaic]]s, used to [[Ornament (architecture)|ornament]] walls, ceilings, fountains, floors, pools and tables.

==History==
{{further|Islamic geometric patterns}}

The [[Moors|Moorish]] art of zellige flourished during the [[Hispano-Moresque]] period ([[Azulejo]]) of the [[Maghreb]] and the area known as [[Al-Andalus]] (modern day [[Spain]]) between 711-1492. The technique was highly developed during the [[Nasrid dynasty]] and [[Merinid dynasty]] who gave it more importance around the 14th century and introduced blue, green and yellow colours. Red was added in the 17th century. The old enamels with the natural colours were used until the beginning of the 20th century and the colours had probably not evolved much since the period of Merinids. The cities of [[Fes]] and [[Meknes]] in [[Morocco]], remain the centers of this art.

Patrons of the art used zellige historically to decorate their homes as a statement of luxury and the sophistication of the inhabitants. Zellige is typically a series of patterns utilizing colourful [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]]. This framework of expression arose from the need of [[Islamic art]]ists to create spatial decorations that [[Aniconism in Islam|avoided depictions of living things]], consistent with the teachings of [[Sharia|Islamic law]].

== Clays for Zellige ==
[[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes in Morocco are still the production centers for zellige tiles due to the [[Miocene]] grey clay of [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]]. The clay from this region is primarily composed of [[Kaolinite]]. For [[Fez, Morocco|Fez]] and Meknes, the clay composition is 2-56% clay minerals, calcite 3-29%. Meriam El Ouahabi states that:

{{quote|From the other sites (Meknes, Fes, Salé and Safi), the clay mineral composition shows besides kaolinite the presence of [[illite]], [[chlorite]], [[smectite]] and traces of mixed layer illite/chlorite (Fig. 3). Meknes clays belong to illitic clays, characterized by illite (54 – 61%), kaolinite (11 – 43%), smectite (8 – 12%) and chlorite (6 – 19%) (Fig. 3). Fes clays have a homogeneous composition (Fig. 3) with illite (40 – 48%). and kaolinite (18 – 28%) as the most abundant clay minerals. Chlorite (12 – 15%) and smectite (9 – 12%) are generally present as small quantities. Mixed layer illite/chlorite is present in trace amounts in all the examined Fes clay materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=El Ouahabi |first=Meriam |year=2014 |title=Mineralogical and geotechnical characterization of clays from northern Morocco for their potential use in the ceramic industry |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/261479494_Preliminary_mineralogical_and_geotechnical_characterization_of_clays_from_Morocco_application_to_ceramic_industry |journal=Clay Minerals |volume=49 |pages=35–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Forms and trends==

As the colour palette of the zellige tiles increased over the centuries, it became possible to multiply the compositions ''ad infinitum''. The most current form of the zellige is a square. Other forms are  possible: the [[octagon]] combined with a [[cabochon]], a [[star]], a [[cross]], etc. It is then [[Molding (process)|moulded]] with a thickness of approximately 2 centimetres. There are simple squares of 10 by 10 centimeters or with the corners cut to be combined with a coloured cabochon. To pave an area, [[bejmat]], a [[Pavement (architecture)|paving stone]] of 15 by 5 centimetres approximately and 2 centimetres thick, can also be used.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"An encyclopedia could not contain the full array of complex, often individually varied patterns and the individually shaped, hand-cut [[tesserae]], or [[furmah]], found in zillij work. Star-based patterns are identified by their number of points—'itnashari for 12, 'ishrini for 20, arba' wa 'ishrini for 24 and so on, but they are not necessarily named with exactitude. The so-called [[khamsini]], for 50 points, and mi'ini, for 100, actually consist of 48 and 96 points respectively, because geometry requires that the number of points of any star in this sequence be divisible by six. (There are also sequences based on five and on eight.) Within a single star pattern, variations abound—by the mix of colors, the size of the furmah, and the complexity and size of interspacing elements such as strapping, braids, or "lanterns." And then there are all the non-star patterns— [[honeycomb]]s, webs, steps and shoulders, and [[checkerboard]]s. The [[Alhambra]]'s interlocking zillij patterns were reportedly a source of inspiration for the tessellations of modern Dutch artist [[M.C. Escher]]."&lt;ref&gt;Werner, Louis. 2001. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200103/zillij.in.fez.htm "Zillij in Fez."] Saudi Aramco World. May–June 2001. Volume 52 (3). Pages 18–31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Themes often employ [[Kufic]] script, as it fits well with the geometry of the mosaic tiles, and patterns often culminate centrally in the [[Rub El Hizb]]. The [[tessellation]]s in the mosaics are currently of interest in academic research in the [[mathematics and art|mathematics of art]].

==Zellige craftsmanship==

Zellige making is considered an [[art]] in itself. The art is transmitted from generation to generation by ''maâlems'' (master craftsmen). A long training starts at childhood to implant the required skills.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beton-decoratif.com/infos.htm beton-decoratif.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Assiduous attention to detail is needed when creating zellige. The small shapes (cut according to a precise [[radius gauge]]), painted and enamel covered pieces are then assembled in a geometrical structure as in a [[puzzle]] to form the completed mosaic. The process has not varied for a millennium, though conception and design has started using new technologies such as [[data processing]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}&lt;gallery&gt;
