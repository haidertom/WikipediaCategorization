'''ASA style''' is a widely accepted format for writing university research papers in the field of [[sociology]]. It specifies the arrangement and punctuation of [[footnote]]s and [[bibliography|bibliographies]]. Standards for ASA style are specified in the ASA [[Style Guide]], which is published by the [[American Sociological Association]], the main scholarly organization for academic sociologists in the [[United States]]. The ''ASA Style Guide'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]], is designed to aid authors preparing manuscripts for ASA journals and publications.

==General features==

ASA style is closely related in appearance and function to APA (American Psychological Association) style. As with [[APA style]], the general format for citing references is [[parenthetical referencing]]. All references are to be included at the end of the paper in a section titled "References," rather than "Works Cited" as in [[MLA style]]. Also unlike MLA style, parenthetical references include the year of publication. The "author-date" in text citation system is a readily recognizable feature of ASA style. This emphasis on dates is carried over into the references section, where the date is the first piece of information to follow the author's or authors' name(s).

==Software support==

ASA style is supported by most major [[reference management software]] programs, including Endnote, Procite, Zotero, Refworks, and so forth, making the formatting of references a fairly straightforward task.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4909">In the [[Creative Arts |creative arts]] and [[scientific literature]], an '''acknowledgement''' (also spelled '''acknowledgment''' in [[American English|American]] and [[Canadian English]]&lt;ref name="gram"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://grammarist.com/spelling/acknowledgment-acknowledgement/ | title=Acknowledgement vs. Acknowledgment – Correct Spelling – Grammarist}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an expression of a gratitude for  assistance in creating an original work.

Receiving [[credit (creative arts) |credit]] by way of acknowledgement rather than authorship indicates that the person or organization did not have a direct hand in producing the work in question, but may have contributed funding, criticism, or encouragement to the author(s). Various schemes exist for classifying acknowledgements; Cronin et al.&lt;ref name="Cronin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cronin |first=Blaise |last2=McKenzie |first2=Gail |last3=Stiffler |first3=Michael |title=Patterns of acknowledgement |journal=[[Journal of Documentation|J. Doc.]] |year=1992 |volume=48 |issue=2 |pages=107–122 |doi=10.1108/eb026893}}&lt;/ref&gt; give the following six categories:
# [[moral support]]
# [[funding |financial support]]
# [[editing |editorial support]]
# [[presentation |presentational support]]
# [[technical support |instrumental/technical support]]
# conceptual support, or peer interactive communication (PIC)

Apart from [[citation]], which is not usually considered to be an acknowledgement, acknowledgement of conceptual support is widely considered to be the most important for identifying intellectual debt. Some acknowledgements of financial support, on the other hand, may simply be legal formalities imposed by the granting institution. Occasionally, bits of science humor can also be found in acknowledgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''Anna Brownell Jameson''' (17 May 1794{{snd}}17 March 1860) was the first Anglo-Irish [[art historian]]. Born in Ireland, she migrated to England at the age of four, becoming a well-known British writer and contributor to nineteenth-century thought on a range of subjects including early feminism, art history (particularly sacred art), travel, Shakespeare, poets, and German culture.  Jameson was connected to some of the most prominent names of the period including [[Fanny Kemble]], [[Elizabeth Barrett-Browning]] and [[Robert Browning]], [[Harriet Martineau]], Ottilie von Goethe (the daughter-in-law of [[Goethe]]), [[Lady Byron]], [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Charles]] and [[Elizabeth Eastlake]], and [[Barbara Leigh Smith Bodichon]].  

==Biography==
Anna Murphy (was born in [[Dublin]], 17 May 1794. Her father, Denis Brownell Murphy (died 1842), was a [[Portrait miniature|miniaturist]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] painter. He moved to England in 1798 with his wife Johanna and four daughters (of whom Anna was the eldest) and eventually settled at [[Hanwell]], London.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Jameson, Anna Brownell|volume=15|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At sixteen years of age, she became governess in the family of [[Charles Paulet, 13th Marquess of Winchester]]. In 1821 she was engaged to lawyer and later [[Upper Canada]] jurist [[Robert Sympson Jameson|Robert Jameson]]. The engagement was broken off, and Anna Murphy accompanied a young pupil to Italy, writing a "autobiographical" narrative under the guise of an unnamed and ailing young woman who eventually dies. She gave this diary to a bookseller on condition of receiving a guitar if he secured any profits. Colburn ultimately published it as ''The Diary of an Ennuyée'' (1826), which attracted much attention, not least because the identity of the writer was soon discovered creating a scandal among reviewers in particular who felt they had been duped.  For Anna however, it was the first taste of notoriety.  Anna Murphy was governess to the children of [[Edward John Littleton, 1st Baron Hatherton|Edward Littleton]], later created [[Baron Hatherton]], from 1821 to 1825, when she relented and married Jameson.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

The marriage proved unhappy. In 1829, when Jameson was appointed [[Chief Justice of the Leeward Islands|puisne judge]] in the island of [[Dominica]], he left Anna in England (never sending for her during his time there despite repeated promises), and she visited [[Continental Europe]] again with her father.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; In that year she made her name when the ''Loves of the Poets'' was published. The book attracted a poem by [[Mrs. Cornwell Baron Wilson]] in tribute.&lt;ref name="spencer"&gt;[http://spenserians.cath.vt.edu/TextRecord.php?textsid=39431 Mrs. Cornwell Baron Wilson], Spenserians, retrieved 21 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

The first work which displayed her powers of original thought was her ''Characteristics of Women'' (1832).
These analyses of [[William Shakespeare]]'s heroines are remarkable for their delicacy of critical insight and fineness of literary touch. They are the result of a penetrating, essentially feminine mind, applied to the study of individuals of its own sex, detecting characteristics and defining differences not perceived by the ordinary critic and entirely overlooked by the general reader.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[German literature]] and art had aroused much interest in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]], and Jameson paid her first visit to the [[German Confederation]] in 1833. The conglomerations of hard lines, cold colours and pedantic subjects which decorated [[Munich]] under the patronage of King [[Ludwig I of Bavaria]], were new to the world, and Jameson's enthusiasm first gave them an English reputation.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

In 1836, Jameson was summoned to Canada by her husband, who had been appointed to the [[Court of Chancery]] of the province of [[Upper Canada]]. Jameson and her husband had already lived apart for over four years, during which Anna made a good living for herself as a writer. She made no secret of the fact that she was unhappy in her marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Clara|title=Dictionary of Canadian Biography|date=2003|publisher=University of Toronto|page=3|edition=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her arrival, her husband failed to meet her at New York and she was left to make her way alone in winter to [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt; Here she began the travelogue of her journey, ''Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada'', which was published in Britain in 1838. She writes in this book her initial distaste for Toronto in her first few months there, describing it as "ugly" and "inefficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Anna|title=Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada (vol. 1)|date=1838|publisher=Saunders and Otley|location=London|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After eight months of travelling and writing in Canada, she felt it useless to prolong a life far from all ties of family happiness and opportunities for a woman of her class and education. Before leaving, she undertook a journey to the depths of the [[First Nations|Indian]] settlements in Canada; she explored [[Lake Huron]], and saw much of emigrant and aboriginal life unknown to colonial travellers. She returned to Great Britain in 1838.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

[[File:Anna Brownell Jameson.jpg|thumb]]
At this period Jameson began making careful notes of the chief private art collections in and near London. The result appeared in her ''Companion to the Private Galleries'' (1842), followed in the same year by the ''Handbook to the Public Galleries''. She edited the ''Memoirs of the Early Italian Painters'' in 1845. That same year she visited her friend Ottilie von Goethe. Her friendship with [[Annabella Byron, 11th Baroness Wentworth]], dates from about this time and lasted for some seven years; it was brought to an end apparently through the Baroness's unreasonable temper.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

A volume of essays published in 1846 contains one of Jameson's best pieces of work, ''The House of Titian''. In 1847 she went to Italy with her niece and subsequent biographer (''Memoirs'', 1878), Gerardine Bate (later the wife of the noted photographer [[Robert Turnbull Macpherson|Robert Macpherson]]), to collect materials for the work on which her reputation rests: her series of ''Sacred and Legendary Art''. The time was ripe for such contributions to the traveller's library. The ''[[Acta Sanctorum]]'' and the ''Book of the [[Golden Legend]]'' had had their readers, but no one had ever pointed out the connection between these tales and the works of Christian art. The way to these studies had been pointed out in the preface to ''Kugler's Handbook of Italian Painting'' by [[Charles Lock Eastlake|Sir Charles Eastlake]], who had intended pursuing the subject himself.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

Eventually he made over to Jameson the materials and references he had collected. She recognised the extent of the ground before her as a mingled sphere of poetry, history, devotion, and art. She infected her readers with her own enthusiastic admiration; and, in spite of her slight technical and historical equipment, Jameson produced a book which thoroughly deserved its great success.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

She also took a keen interest in questions affecting the education, occupations, and maintenance of her own sex. Her early essay on ''The Relative Social Position of Mothers and Governesses'' was the work of one who knew both sides; and in no respect does she more clearly prove the falseness of the position she describes than in the certainty with which she predicts its eventual reform. To her we owe the first popular enunciation of the principle of male and female co-operation in works of mercy and education. In her later years she took up a succession of subjects all bearing on the same principles of active benevolence and the best ways of carrying them into practice. Sisters of charity, hospitals, penitentiaries, prisons, and workhouses all claimed her interest – all more or less included under those definitions of "the communion of love and communion of labour" which are inseparably connected with her memory. To the clear and temperate forms in which she brought the results of her convictions before her friends in the shape of private lectures (published as ''Sisters of Charity'', 1855, and ''The Communion of Labour'', 1856) may be traced the source whence later reformers and philanthropists took counsel and courage.&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

She left the last of her ''Sacred and Legendary Art'' series in preparation. It was completed as ''The History of Our Lord in Art'', by [[Lady Eastlake]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"/&gt;

'''Archeogeography''' is an academic discipline that deals with the dynamics of [[space]] over time and helps to explore other dimensions of [[Historical geography|geohistorical]] objects that have been made so far by the disciplines of historical geography, the geo-history and [[archaeology]] of the landscape or the environment.

'''Attitude-behavior consistency''' is when a person's attitude is consistent with their [[behavior]]. This is not true in many cases. The fact that people often express attitudes that are inconsistent with how they act may surprise those unfamiliar with social and behavioral science, but it is an important fact to understand because facts are often reported as if they are about people's actions when they may only be known to be true about their words. It is often much easier to conduct interviews or surveys than to obtain records of how people behave in situations.  Sometimes attitudes, such as voting, are measurably consistent with behavior.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jerolmack|first=Colin|last2=Khan|first2=Shamus|date=2014-05-01|title=Talk Is Cheap Ethnography and the Attitudinal Fallacy|url=http://smr.sagepub.com/content/43/2/178|journal=Sociological Methods &amp; Research|language=en|volume=43|issue=2|pages=178–209|doi=10.1177/0049124114523396|issn=0049-1241}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In such cases it may be possible to obtain accurate estimates of behavior. However, there is no general method for correcting for attitude-behavior inconsistency.

== Applications to research methodology ==
Attitude-behavior consistency is an important concept for social science research because claims are often made about behavior based on evidence which is really about [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The attitudinal fallacy is committed when verbal data are used to support claims not about what people believe or say, but what they do.  Data collection methods based on self-report like [[Survey methodology|surveys]], and [[Interview (research)|interviews]]   are vulnerable to the attitudinal fallacy if they attempt to measure behavior and reported attitudes are inconsistent with the behavior. 

Research methods that directly observe behaviors avoid the attitudinal fallacy as a matter of course.  However many kinds of behavior are not easily observed. [[Ethnography]] can make rich observations and descriptions of behavior and allow for comparison between behavior and attitude. Unfortunately, in general ethnographic data cannot be used to draw statistically generalizable conclusions about behavior in a population.Ethnographers can still commit the attitudinal fallacy if they rely on quotations as evidence for behaviors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Experiment|Experiments]] in laboratories make it possible to observe behavior, with the limitations that come from the laboratory situation. [[Internet research]] makes it possible to study a wide array of behaviors that leave traces online. Data from the [[Internet of things]] and sensors that record behavior like from location tracking may make it possible to measure more kinds of behavior that avoids the attitudinal fallacy. It may not be possible to study some kinds of behavior other than through interviews or surveys. While the knowledge produced in such cases may be useful.  The possibility of inconsistency between behavior and reported attitudes is always a concern.      

Methods that are limited by their inability to measure behavior can still contribute to important understandings. These include how meaning is created, the significance of events to individuals, emotion, semiotics, representation and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lamont|first=Michèle|last2=Swidler|first2=Ann|date=2014-04-08|title=Methodological Pluralism and the Possibilities and Limits of Interviewing|journal=Qualitative Sociology|language=en|volume=37|issue=2|pages=153–171|doi=10.1007/s11133-014-9274-z|issn=0162-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
* In the 1930s [[Richard LaPiere]] asked 251 hotel proprietors if they would serve Chinese guests and only 1 said ''yes.'' However, when he followed around a young Chinese couple that visited the hotels they only denied service once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lapiere|first=Richard|year=1934|title=Attitudes vs. Actions|journal=Social Forces|volume=13|issue=2|pages=230–37|doi=10.2307/2570339|jstor=2570339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Although most employers in an audit study reported that they were willing to give job interviews to young male black ex-offenders, they were unlikely provide interviews when presented with opportunities to interview men appearing to be so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* People in health studies where they are asked to report how much food they eat tend to report eating less than they actually do.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hebert|first=James R.|last2=Clemow|first2=Lynn|last3=Pbert|first3=Lori|last4=Ockene|first4=Ira S.|last5=Ockene|first5=Judith K.|date=1995-04-01|title=Social Desirability Bias in Dietary Self-Report May Compromise the Validity of Dietary Intake Measures|url=http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/24/2/389|journal=International Journal of Epidemiology|language=en|volume=24|issue=2|pages=389–398|doi=10.1093/ije/24.2.389|issn=0300-5771|pmid=7635601}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ways attitudes and behaviors can be different ==

=== Social desirability ===
{{Main article| Social desirability bias}}  

Reports of attitudes and behaviors may be subject to social desirability bias.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fisher|first=Robert J.|date=1993-09-01|title=Social Desirability Bias and the Validity of Indirect Questioning|url=http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/2/303|journal=Journal of Consumer Research|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=303–315|doi=10.1086/209351|issn=0093-5301}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even in cases where respondents are anonymous, people may be less likely to acknowledge  behaviors that they see as undesirable. Conversely they may be more likely to report behaviors that are seen as more desirable.  Social desirability bias results from inconsistency between attitudes and behaviors. This is because although people may have positive attitudes toward behaviors they see as desirable, they do not actually perform the behaviors as often as they say they do. Studies making claims about behaviors based on reports when behaviors may be seen as desirable may be particularly sensitive to the attitudinal fallacy. Although indirect questioning has been a common practice among survey researchers, it is not generally effective at mitigating social desirability bias.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

People do not necessarily agree on which attitudes are socially desirable. Moreover, these attitudes may be situational (see below) and vary from setting to setting. Therefore, the ways in which attitudes are biased by social desirability may be interesting in its own right. Therefore, social desirability may not invalidate measures of internal factors such as personality in the same way as it invalidates studies of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ones|first=Deniz S.|last2=Viswesvaran|first2=Chockalingam|last3=Reiss|first3=Angelika D.|title=Role of social desirability in personality testing for personnel selection: The red herring|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|volume=81|issue=6|pages=660–679|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.81.6.660|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attitudes and behaviors are situational  ===
A person's attitude and behavior both vary from situation to situation.  Behaviors may vary as when a person who rarely edits Wikipedia does so for a class assignment. Attitudes also vary from situation to situation. A college freshman may disapprove of binge drinking, only to subsequently become socialized to practice and celebrate doing so in the course of [[tailgating]].  Sometimes attitudes and behavior may be linked to reduce [[cognitive dissonance]]. But this need not be the case.

'''Background music''' refers to the various styles of [[music]] or [[soundscape]]s primarily intended to be passively listened to. It is not meant to be the main focus of an audience, but rather to supplement that which is meant to be focused upon. Music that is played at a low volume and is not the main focus of an audience is also referred to as background music. Traditional examples of background music include music played at various [[Party|social gatherings]] and music played in certain [[Retail|retail venues]]. It is also common to employ background music in various [[electronic media]] including [[film]], [[television]], [[video game]]s, and [[Internet]] [[video]]s such as [[video blog]]s.

==Psychological study==
The study of background music focuses on the impact of music with non-musical tasks, including changes in behavior in the presence of different types, settings, or styles of music.&lt;ref name=Kampfe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kampfe|first=J.|author2=Sedlmeier, P. |author3=Renkewitz, F. |title=The impact of background music on adult listeners: A meta-analysis|journal=Psychology of Music|date=8 November 2010|volume=39|issue=4|pages=424–448|doi=10.1177/0305735610376261}}&lt;/ref&gt; In laboratory settings, music can affect performance on cognitive tasks (memory, [[attention]], and [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]]), both positively and negatively. Used extensively as an [[advertising]] aid, music may also affect [[marketing strategies]], ad comprehension, and consumer choices.

====Tasks music improves====
Participants who memorized [[foreign language]] words while listening to [[Baroque music]]  recalled an average of 8.7% more words than those who did not listen to music. The effect of music was stronger for less common words, and there was no effect of music on recall a week later.&lt;ref name="de Groot" /&gt;

The [[Mozart effect]] occurs when performance on cognitive tasks requiring [[spatial manipulations]] (such as a [[mental rotation]] task) improves after listening to fifteen minutes of [[Mozart]].&lt;ref name=Aheadi /&gt;&lt;ref name=Rauscher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rauscher|first=Frances H.|author2=Shaw, Gordon L. |author3=Ky, Catherine N. |title=Music and spatial task performance|journal=Nature|date=14 October 1993|volume=365|issue=6447|pages=611–611|doi=10.1038/365611a0|pmid=8413624}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a typical mental rotation task, participants see two [[Stereoscopy|3D]] shapes drawn on paper, and then decide if they are different views of the same shape or different shapes. This comparison often requires mental rotation of the object. The Mozart effect is inconsistent when tested with musicians and non-musicians. Only non-musicians showed any improvement when given the mental rotation task before and after listening to Mozart.&lt;ref name=Aheadi /&gt; Musicians tend to process music using both [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]], whereas non-musicians use mostly their [[right hemisphere]]. Listening to Mozart increased arousal in the right hemisphere (active during mental rotation), and non-musicians may have performed better due to more right hemisphere activity.&lt;ref name=Aheadi /&gt;

[[Digit detection]] tasks require participants to monitor a stream of letters for two randomly placed digits, and [[attentional blink]] (the inability to detect the second visual target) may occur after the first digit is detected.&lt;ref name=Olivers /&gt; When accompanied by task-irrelevant mental activity, performance can actually improve on attentionally-demanding [[visual search]] tasks. Detection rates of the second digit were significantly higher when accompanied by music.&lt;ref name=Olivers /&gt; This suggests that background music may facilitate increased [[arousal]] or increased positive [[affective state]], leading to better attention. It is also possible that the music induces a more diffuse distribution of attention, so that participants can attend over a broader search that includes the second digit.&lt;ref name=Olivers /&gt;

A similar phenomenon, [[inattentional blindness]], refers to the tendency to miss a novel [[stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] when attending to other stimuli.&lt;ref name=Beanland /&gt; As a laboratory task, participants are instructed to attend to moving visual stimuli on a computer monitor while an "A" of a different color moves across the screen.&lt;ref name=Beanland /&gt; A simple auditory task required participants to listen for an occasional embedded tone amidst background music, and this attenuated the blindness to the "A". Participants were able to perform both tasks simultaneously at a higher rate than the [[visual monitoring]] alone, and engaged in fewer task-unrelated thoughts, suggesting that not all increases in task demand are equal. Music may fill a special role that leads to increased arousal without affecting concurrent task performance.&lt;ref name=Beanland /&gt;

====Tasks music impairs====
Though increased arousal from music listening may improve cognitive performance (possibly the process through which the Mozart effect occurs),&lt;ref name=Kampfe /&gt; the irrelevant sound effect (or [[irrelevant speech effect]])&lt;ref name=Perham /&gt; can also occur. When two concurrent sources of information compete for processing, the sources interfere with each other. For example, in advertisements, studies have shown that the presence of lyrics in background music can draw a consumer's attention away from the main point of the ad. Although it may seem like a nice supplement, background music can be a distraction from the intended message.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kang|first=Esther|last2=Lakshmann|first2=Arun|date=2017|title=Role of executive attention in consumer learning with background music|url=|journal=Journal of Consumer Psychology|volume=27|pages=35–48|via=Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[serial recall]] tasks participants must recall (in the correct order) lists of digits or words. Music with a high degree of acoustic variation tends to inhibit performance on serial recall tasks by drawing on [[Cognitive resource theory|cognitive resources]].&lt;ref name=Perham /&gt;

When performing [[digit span]] tasks in the presence of music, participants must recall a string of digits of increasing length. Those completing the tasks in silence performed significantly better than those listening to music (it did not matter if the music was liked or disliked).&lt;ref name=Perham /&gt;

====Mixed effects and moderating factors====
In a [[verbal learning]] test that consisted of words and non-words, background music had no significant impact on test performance.&lt;ref name=Jancke /&gt; Participants studied with original excerpts in which tempo and [[Consonance and dissonance|consonance]] (in or out of tune) were manipulated,  nondescript noise, and silence. While test performance did not differ across these conditions, stronger [[EEG]] readings were registered with consonant and fast music.&lt;ref name=Jancke /&gt; This suggests music may draw more cognitive resources, though increased [[cortical activation]] compensates to preserve task performance.&lt;ref name=Kampfe /&gt;

=====Musical variations=====
The nature of the background music, either [[vocal]] or [[instrumental]], and the perceived correctness of the music can change its effect on cognitive performance.

Working memory, and more specifically the [[phonological loop]] (memory process through which auditory information is rehearsed and stored for short-term recall), plays an integral role in [[Information processing|processing]] [[digit span]] tasks.&lt;ref name=Alley /&gt; In the presence of either vocal music or irrelevant speech, performance appears to suffer similarly with both, whereas listening to instrumental renderings of the same songs (or working in silence) tends to lead to better performance.&lt;ref name=Alley /&gt;

The presence of [[lyrics]] differentially affects performance depending on the nature of the task. Performance on verbal tests ([[reading comprehension]]) tends to improve with silence versus either vocal or instrumental music. On the other hand, [[math]] [[test performance]] is higher with vocal music than with instrumental. [[Logic]] performance (understanding [[flowcharts]] or diagrams) is higher with ''either'' vocal or instrumental versus silence.&lt;ref name=Avila /&gt; If music leads to a more aroused state, it appears to only improve performance when the music does not directly interfere with the task (e.g., ''lyrics'' interfere with ''verbal'' processing).&lt;ref name=Avila /&gt;

Expert musicians and non-musicians listened to either music played correctly, played with errors, or silence while performing a language-based task (evaluating grammar in given sentences).&lt;ref name=Patston /&gt; Both musicians and non-musicians performed worse while listening to incorrectly played music versus silence, but only musicians performed significantly worse in the presence of incorrect music versus correct music. With a [[Spatial visualization ability|visuo-spatial]] search task (locating differences between nearly identical images filled with [[geometric patterns]] and color), neither group was affected by the music conditions.&lt;ref name=Patston /&gt; Musicians were more attentive to the errors in the music, and their performance suffered more. Though music can be arousing and lead to higher cognitive performance, it can also be distracting.&lt;ref name=Patston /&gt;

=====Personality=====
The Cortical Arousal Theory suggests that background music may differentially impact cognitive performance based on certain [[personality psychology|personality]] traits.&lt;ref name=Cassidy /&gt; Both [[Extraversion and introversion|introverts]] and [[Extraversion and introversion|extraverts]] tend to perform higher on immediate recall (recalling ideas from a story just read), delayed recall, and [[Stroop effect|Stroop]] tasks in silence versus popular lyrical music.&lt;ref name=Cassidy /&gt; Introvert's performance suffered more than extravert's with highly arousing music, suggesting internal arousal through music can differentially affect cognitive performance.

Music provides a material rendering of self-identity; that is, it provides a material in and with which to identify identity. Music is a "mirror" that allows one to "see one's self" and serves as a repository of value or self-perception.&lt;ref&gt;DeNora, Tia. Music as a Technology of Self.

The timbre, tempo, lyrics, genre, mood, as well as any positive or negative associations elicited by certain music should fit the nature of the advertisement and product.&lt;ref name=OAKES /&gt; For example, playing classical music in the background has been shown to increase the amount of money that people are willing to spend on a product, as it is associated with an "upmarket" image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Music Congruity Effects on Product Memory, Perception, and Choice|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002243591500055X|journal = Journal of Retailing|doi = 10.1016/j.jretai.2015.06.001|first = Adrian C.|last = North|first2 = Lorraine P.|last2 = Sheridan|first3 = Charles S.|last3 = Areni|volume=92|pages=83–95|year = 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Product involvement refers to the degree of personal relevance and perceived purchase risk regarding a given product, while advertising involvement refers to the amount of attention directed toward the advertisement and its content.&lt;ref name=OAKES /&gt; Both types can be more cognitively (content-focused) or affectively (emotion-focused) oriented, changing the way in which background music interacts with advertisement viewing or listening.

====Recall====
When viewing 30-second TV ads containing background [[classical music]], recall was tested for [[brand]] name and message content.&lt;ref name=Hahn /&gt; Participants viewed an original commercial (for a fictional brand of soap) embedded in an episode of [[America’s Funniest Home Videos]]. The same commercial was paired with either familiar or unfamiliar classical music of a slow or fast tempo. Results revealed an inverted-U relationship between tempo and recall (faster tempo correlated with higher recall to a certain point, then recall began to suffer). This was only found when the ad contained familiar music, suggesting that familiarity [[Mediation (statistics)|mediates]] advertisement involvement.&lt;ref name=Hahn /&gt; This supports a resource-matching [[hypothesis]]:  message processing is maximized when the cognitive resources demanded match those available. As music speed increases, information density in the ad increases. As long as cognitive resources are not exceeded, ad processing more equally matches an increased state of arousal through the music.&lt;ref name=Hahn /&gt;

In real radio commercials, data reveal a different relationship when the whole stimulus is auditory.&lt;ref name=Oakes /&gt; Though a better match (higher congruity) between musical timbre and ad message led to higher recall, both slow and fast background music reduced content recall, with slower music leading to significantly lower performance than fast music.&lt;ref name=Oakes /&gt;

Background music can act as a peripheral [[persuasion]] cue, evoking emotional responses and positive attitudes toward both the advertisement and the brand. These emotional responses can also interfere with recall.&lt;ref name=Park /&gt; Women were shown a TV commercial for a fictional brand of hair shampoo, and assigned either to a "cognitively involved" group (instructed to pay attention to the specifics of product quality and ratings), an "affectively involved" group (instructed to watch for the product's unique personality).&lt;ref name=Park /&gt; Popular music played in the background and facilitated recall only in the affective involvement group; it had a distracting effect with cognitive involvement.&lt;ref name=Park /&gt; This suggests a differential effect of background music in commercials based on product involvement and types of processing.

====Intentions and attitudes====
Attention paid to the ad and brand, attitudes toward each, and [[purchase intentions]] were measured in response to fictional [[TV commercials]] that contained either culturally appropriate or inappropriate music.&lt;ref name=Lawani /&gt; Congruent product-music commercials (e.g., Asian music paired with Asian product) elicited significantly more favorable attitudes toward the product.&lt;ref name=Lawani /&gt;

Radio commercials, when paired with congruent music (rated in another experiment as fitting the product being advertised), show similar trends.&lt;ref name=Lavack /&gt; Congruent music elicits more positive attitudes toward the advertisement and brand in "high-cognition" ads (e.g., focuses on Rolex specifications) than in "low-cognition" ads (e.g., focuses on feelings accompanying a Rolex).&lt;ref name=Lavack /&gt; The musical fit differentially affected ad impact based on the type of commercial.

When background music fits radio ad content, but varies on tempo, style, and rhythm, participants formed different impressions of the brand and its endorser. With a slow [[piano]] [[ballad]], for example, participants perceived the endorser as more diligent and orderly than when he endorsed a product with [[rock music]]. Even given these different impressions, participants did not significantly change their general evaluation of the product.&lt;ref name=Zander /&gt; In all conditions there was a high degree of musical fit, but perceptions of brand and endorser can change separate from views toward the ad.&lt;ref name=Zander /&gt;

===Retail environment===

In a survey of shoppers at a suburban mall, both hedonic (pleasure) and utilitarian evaluations of a given shopping experience differed based on an interaction between retail density and the tempo of music playing in the mall. Shoppers are attracted to scenery, smells, and sounds; the more pleasant the shopper feels the more they tend to spend. Past research by Morrin showed that pleasant scents can enhance cognition and cause people to better remember the details of products.[20] Retail density (number of shoppers) was determined by the time of day and day of the week, while slow and fast music were played. A shopping experience can influence browsing behaviors and evaluations were highest with slow music and high density or fast music and low density.[20] This random survey lends support to a "schema incongruity theory" stating that more elaborate information processing occurs under mildly incongruous conditions. The incongruity between density and music tempo seems to create that condition.[20]

When participants viewed videos of interactions between a sales clerk and a shopper, slow and soothing music led to more negative evaluations toward the store and salesperson, if the sales pitch was weaker.[21] The type of music affected cognitive processing (slow music allowed for greater resources to be used in evaluating the sales pitch). Thus participants viewed a weaker sales pitch more critically, except when faster music drew more resources.[21] Musical fit also applies to retail situations. Regardless of the type of music, however, it needs to at least match the store environment and product to garner positive reactions.[21]

People who tend to do unplanned shopping tend to spend more when hear background music, people who have plan to shop tend to spend less even when there is music playing.

=== Historical devices ===
The 1964 3M [[Cantata 700]] played continuous and auto-reversing one of its large and proprietary [[magnetic tape]] cartridges, containing up to 26 hours of music. The [[Rowe Customusic]] was an endless tape cartridge player, loading simultaneous six C-type [[Fidelipac]] cartridges. The 1959 [[Seeburg 1000]] was a stack [[record player]], playing both sides continuous and repeating up to 1000 songs and up to 25 special 9" vinyl records with a 2" center bore at 16⅔ PRM.

==Types==

===Incidental music===
{{Main|Incidental music}}
Incidental music is music in a play, radio/TV program or some other form that is not primarily musical, adding atmosphere to the action. It can be dated back at least as far as Greek drama. A number of classical composers have written incidental music for various plays.

===Furniture music===
{{Main|Furniture music}}
The term ''furniture music'' was coined by [[Erik Satie]] in 1917. It fell into disuse when the composer died a few years later, and the genre was revived several decades later. Typical of furniture music are short musical passages, with an indefinite number of repeats.

===Elevator music===
{{Main article|Muzak}}
[[Elevator]] music (also [[Muzak]], piped music, or lift music) is a more general term indicating music that is played in rooms where many people come together (that is, with no intention whatsoever to listen to music), and during telephone calls when placed on hold. There is a specific ''sound'' associated with elevator music, usually involving themes from "soft" popular music or "[[light music|light]]" classical music being worked over by slow strings. This type of music was produced, for instance, by the [[Mantovani|Mantovani Orchestra]], and conductors like [[Franck Pourcel]] and [[James Last]], peaking in popularity around the 1970s.

The term can also be used for kinds of [[easy listening]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vSpqAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA52|page=52|title=American Popular Music, Grades 5 – 8|author= Mark Ammons|publisher=Mark Twain Media|date= 6 Aug 2010|isbn=978-1-58037-983-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[piano]] solo, [[jazz]] or [[middle of the road (music)|middle of the road]] music, or what are known as "[[beautiful music]]" radio stations.

This style of music is sometimes used to comedic effect in [[mass media]] such as [[film]], where intense or dramatic scenes may be interrupted or interspersed with such anodyne music while characters use an elevator. Some [[video game]]s have used music similarly: ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots|Metal Gear Solid 4]]'' where a few elevator music-themed tracks are accessible on the in-game [[iPod]], as well as ''[[Rise of the Triad: Dark War]]''.{{original research inline|date=November 2016}}

Some people can be deeply annoyed by piped music, and even find it spoils their enjoyment in recreation or drives them out of shops: Eight out of 10 people have left an establishment early because it was too noisy.&lt;ref name="Pipedown"&gt;See [http://www.pipedown.info/ Pipedown]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a number of societies, such as [[Pipedown (campaign)|Pipedown]],&lt;ref name="Pipedown"/&gt; that are dedicated to reducing its extent and intrusiveness.  The [[Good Pub Guide]] 2017 called for a ban on piped music in pubs, already the case in houses managed by the [[Samuel Smith Brewery]].

===Video game and blog music===
Background music (often abbreviated BGM) is the [[video game music|music in video games]] (sometimes written VGM) and music in websites.

===Internet delivered background music===
In recent years the proliferation of Internet delivered background music by such companies as [[Trusonic]] has gained traction.  This allows the retailer to instantly update music and messages which are deployed at the store level as opposed to using older [[compact disc]] and [[satellite]] technologies.{{fact|date=May 2018}}

=={{anchor}}Background Non-music==
===Business audio===
'''Business audio''' refers to a type of service that provides audio content that is licensed for use in a commercial setting.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Business news can be one example. The term ''background music'' is another example. Providers of the latter include:
* [[Muzak Holdings LLC]]
* [[DMX (music)|DMX]]
* [[Playnetwork|PlayNetwork]]
* [[XM|XM for Business]]
* [[Music Choice]]
* [[Applied Media Technologies Corporation]], 
* Rock 300, 
* [[Trusonic]], and 
* Business Audio Plus

In the United States, the terms "elevator music" and "Muzak" are commonly used to refer to business audio services that provide background music in retail settings.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

==History==
Founded in 1934, [[Muzak Holdings|Muzak]] was among the early background music providers. 

Business audio is produced off-site and delivered to the client via a number of methods including [[Direct broadcast satellite|DBS]] satellite, [[Digital Audio Radio Service|SDARS]] satellite, [[coaxial cable]], [[FM radio]] [[subcarrier]], [[leased line]], [[internet]] [[broadband]], [[compact disc]], and [[Magnetic tape|tape]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Most audio content is licensed for personal and home use only. Business audio services allow clients to use audio content in public and commercial settings by paying appropriate royalties to performing rights organizations like [[ASCAP]], [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]], [[SESAC]] and [[Gesellschaft für musikalische Aufführungs- und mechanische Vervielfältigungsrechte|GEMA]] in Germany.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

The '''British Academy of Management''' ('''BAM'''), founded in 1986, is a [[learned society]] dedicated  to advancing the academic discipline of [[management]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a member of the [[Academy of Social Sciences]]. The academy runs two [[academic journal]]s: the ''[[British Journal of Management]]'' and the ''[[International Journal of Management Reviews]]''. Once a year, it publishes an article which is presented at the annual conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = British Academy Of Management,London,UK|url = http://10times.com/organizers/british-academy-management|website = 10times.com|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headquartered of the British Academy of Management is in London, United Kingdom.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
The British Academy of Management was founded in 1986, exactly 50 years after the [[Academy of Management|AoM]] was formed in [[Chicago]]. [[Cary Cooper]] was its first President and [[Andrew Pettigrew]] was its first Chairman. During the AoM conference in [[San Diego]] in 1985 they realize the lack of a multidisciplinary association in the UK and decided to establish BAM.

The biggest challenges for this new organisation were to set up a [[constitution]] and to exercise good governance through a strong executive committee. The inaugural conference of BAM was at the [[University of Warwick]] in 1987. This was organised by [[Andrew Pettigrew]]. With over 200 delegates, the conference had an immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = 1 November 2015|accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 2–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early days ===
From the mid 1980s to the early 1990s, the management of the Academy was still based on an amateur approach, because of the moving from one place to another. The nomadic life of the BAM office and the lack of a centralized system meant that outgoing chairpersons packaged the documents and sent them on to the institution of the new chair. Sometimes, this delivery arrived without all the key papers. BAM headquarters had to be moved from one city to another for a bit more than a decade, until they found a stable home in 2002 in [[London]]. Thus, the records eventually delivered to HQ were not very comprehensive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 4–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conferences ===
In the 1990s, BAM struggled to find conference venues, and to attract persons due to the fact that the attendance was low. As the time passed there was a growth in both domestic and international attendance, especially from Europe. At this time, it was observed that the conferences were more about social interaction than about the discussion of serious research. Combining both consistently high academic quality and the fun factor became a priority by the late 1990s.

The first BAM Workshop took place on 5 January 1989 entitled ''‘Organisation and Strategic Decision Making’'' at [[Bradford Management Centre]], [[University of Bradford]]. It had 69 participants who came from [[England]], [[Wales]], [[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Brazil]], [[United States|US]], [[China]] and [[France]]. It was organised by Richard Butler, Richard Pike and John Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |pages = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First BAM Journal ===
BAM’s founders wanted to start publishing a journal. Cary Cooper managed one of the AoM divisions that had its own journal and he suggested that BAM should do the same.  Cooper coordinated a small group from Council who interviewed a number of  publishing companies for a five-year contract, [[John Wiley &amp; Sons|John Wiley]] won the first contract. The [[British Journal of Management]] (BJM) was launched in early 1990 and had 4 issues a year running into 64 pages. The General Editor was [[David Otley]] and the Associate Editors were John Burgoyne, [[John McGee (editor)|John McGee]], Roy Payne, [[Nigel Piercy]] and [[Roy Rothwell]]. BJM purpose was to receive articles from a full range of business and management disciplines and to have a multi and inter disciplinary orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = History of the British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The formation of Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ===
One of the significant changes to BAM’s structure happened in 1999 with the formation of [[Special Interest Group]]s (SIGs). The aim of the SIGs was to encourage greater member participation and to provide a more diverse range of activities for members. The first SIGs were ''Entrepreneurship and Innovation and Management Consultancy but Learning and Knowledge, Interorganisational Relations, Performance Management, Philosophy of Management, Research Methodology, Creativity and Creative Industries'' and ''E-Business'' soon joined them. The SIG structure proved a thriving way to organise BAM’s  conferences,offering richer benefits for the membership. SIGs also provided new opportunities for less experienced academics to play active roles in the Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/sites/bam.ac.uk/files/History%20of%20BAM.pdf|title = The History of British Academy of Management|date = |accessdate = 1 November 2015|website = British Academy of Management|publisher = British Academy of Management|last = |first = |page = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Journal of Management Reviews (IJMR) ===
The success of the British Journal of Management (BJM) was joined by BAM’s acquisition of the [[International Journal of Management Reviews]] (IJMR). Cary Cooper and Alan Pearson had been the first editors.

== Governance ==
British Academy of Management has an Executive Committee and a Council.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Governance Structure {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/governance-structure|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== BAM Executive ===
An Executive Committee, is elected to develop the strategy, work with Council and ensure an effective implementation of the chosen strategy. Since 2014 the leadership team was remodeled. This consist of a President, a Chair, four elected Vice-Chairs and an appointed Vice Chair of Resources/Treasurer.
* President : Professor Sir Cary Cooper
* Chair: Professor [[Nic Beech]]
* Treasurer/ Vice Chair: Resources: James Johnston
* Vice Chair:
** Research and Publications: Professor Bill Cooke
**  Academic Affairs of Conference and Capacity Building: Professor [[David Denyer]]
**  Special Interest Groups: [[Anne Clare Gillon]]
**  Management Knowledge and Education: Dr [[Katy Mason]]

=== BAM Council ===
The Council, which comprises approximately 30 people elected for a minimum of 3 years by the general membership, represents the interests of membership and contributes to the activities of the learned society through working with the vice-chairs. The role of Council is to elaborate strategy and policy, and to implement strategy in conjunction with the Executive and Academy office.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Special Interest Groups (SIGs) ==
Special Interest Groups are networks of researchers that are focused in a specific area of management research. They organize events throughout the year and provide the members with an academic forum for the discussion on relevant topics.

SIGs are run by BAM members, with support from the BAM office. They organise workshop and events on topics relevant to their research area, and take the lead in managing the academic programme at the annual BAM Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Special Interest Groups {{!}} bam.ac.uk|url = https://www.bam.ac.uk/special-interest-groups|website = www.bam.ac.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here are some SIGs networks:
* Corporate Governance
* e-Business and e-Government
* Entrepreneurship
* Human Resource Management
* Innovation
* International Business and International Management
* Inter-Organizational Collaboration: Partnerships, Alliances and Networks
* Knowledge and Learning
* Leadership and Leadership Development
* Marketing and Retail

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4544">From 2004-2014, the '''Cingranelli-Richards (CIRI) Human Rights Data Project''' annually rated the level of government respect for a variety of internationally recognized human rights. The final CIRI data set contains quantitative indicators of 15 human rights for 195 countries, annually from 1981-2011. The CIRI data were used in over 170 countries by scholars, students, policymakers, and analysts representing over 400 organizations. CIRI's founders and co-directors were political scientists Dr. [[David Cingranelli]] at [[Binghamton University]], SUNY &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.binghamton.edu/political-science/faculty/david-cingranelli.html David L. Cingranelli] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223173736/http://www2.binghamton.edu/political-science/faculty/david-cingranelli.html |date=2014-02-23 }}, Professor of Political Science, Department of Political Science, Binghamton University (SUNY).&lt;/ref&gt; and Dr. [[David L. Richards]] at the [[University of Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidlrichards.com David Richards], Associate Professor of Political Science and Human Rights, University of Connecticut.&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. K.

CIRI's data, documentation, and blog posts were archived at [http://www.humanrightsdata.com www.humanrightsdata.com].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanrightsdata.com CIRI Human Rights Data Project], website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accessing the data==

The CIRI data were free for not-for-profit users. Once registered, CIRI users could create customized datsets, choosing only the indicators, countries, and years they needed; or, they could download the entire data set. As of December 2007, CIRI began using its own numeric country identifier code, but continued to offer others for the purpose of data merging. The MyCIRI feature allowed users to store their datasets on the CIRI server and easily update them when the master CIRI data was updated.

==Financial support==

Financial support for the CIRI Data Project came from the United States' [[National Science Foundation]];&lt;ref&gt;National Science Foundation Grant Nos. SBR-9730130 (1997-1998), SES-0318273 (2004-2006), SES-0647969 (2007-2010), and SES-0647916 (2007-2010).&lt;/ref&gt; [[The World Bank]]; [[GTZ]]; [[Binghamton University]], SUNY; the Center on Democratic Performance at Binghamton University, SUNY; The Human Rights Institute and College of Liberal Arts &amp; Sciences at [[The University of Connecticut]].

==CIRI human rights indicators==

The CIRI database coded only human rights PRACTICES of governments. The human rights for which government levels of respect were annually rated by CIRI included:

* Assembly &amp; Association
* Disappearance
* Domestic Movement
* Electoral Self-Determination (formerly Political Participation &amp; Free and Fair Elections)
* Empowerment Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for electoral self-determination, domestic movement, foreign movement, religion, speech, assembly &amp; association, and workers' rights)
* Extrajudicial Killing
* Foreign Movement
* Independence of the Judiciary
* Physical Integrity Rights Index (An additive index summarizing government respect for disappearance, extrajudicial killing, political imprisonment, and torture)
* Political Imprisonment
* Religion
* Speech
* Torture
* Women's Economic Rights
* Women's Political Rights
* Women's Social Rights
* Workers' Rights

Most of the CIRI indicators were ratings (as opposed to rankings) on a scale of 0-2 for their respect of human rights, as follows:

*0= Frequent violations of this right
*1= Some violations of this right
*2= No reported violations of this right

The CIRI database used the annual country reports from the US State Department and Amnesty International as its primary sources.

The '''China Academy of Urban Planning and Design''' ({{lang-zh|c=中国城市规划设计研究院|p=Zhōngguó Chéngshì Guīhuà Shèjì yán Jiùyuàn}}) is a [[research institution]] under the [[Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development]] (MOHURD) and a national information center for planning studies. It is a service provider in the areas of urban planning, engineering design, engineering consulting, tourism planning, engineering surveying for heritage preservation, water-resource assessment for development projects, and architectural design and system integration for intelligent buildings. It is also qualified as a national service provider to undertake overseas projects in civil engineering surveying, consulting, design and inspection. In addition, the Academy is entitled to organize overseas study tours and to run international training programs in the planning field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukna.asia/organisation/china-academy-urban-planning-and-design-caupd |title=China Academy of Urban Planning and Design (CAUPD) |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=Urban Knowledge Network Asia |publisher= |access-date=20 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sci.uoregon.edu/sci-china-partners |title=Partners |last= |first= |date= |website=Sustainable Cities Initiative |publisher=University of Oregon |access-date= 20 August 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==

CAUPD has four major roles: 
# to offer planning advice for government authorities; 
# to undertake planning studies and compose relevant norms; 
# to provide planning consulting services; and 
# to carry out works for social and public welfare.

==Relationships with other organisations==

CAUPD is authorized by the Academic Degrees Committee of the State Council to confer [[Master's Degree]]s in Urban Planning and to operate a post-doctorate research station. It also is the backing and sponsoring body of over ten academic organizations such as the [[Urban Planning Society of China]], the Urban Transport Planning Committee of China and the National Network of Scientific and Technological Information in Urban Planning.  The organization routinely sends groups of its employees to the [[UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs]] in Los Angeles, California to study and participate in social exchanges with master's degree students in Urban Planning.  In a related exchange, masters students in Urban Planning from the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs, [[USC Sol Price School of Public Policy]], and [[Portland State University]] have been welcomed to participate in internships in various CAUPD offices. CAUPD has also established links with relevant academic institutions and companies from more than 20 countries in the world. It is the corporate member of the International Federation of Housing and Planning (IFHP).

CAUPD is the corporate member of China International Engineering Consulting Corporation. It is also the national administrative and technical office on planning norms and rail transport codes. Three research centers of MHURD are located in CAUPD: the Urban Transport Center, the Urban Rail and LRT Research Center, the Urban Water Resources Center and Urban Water Quality Inspecting Center.

CAUPD advocates and promotes the ethos of “realistic in spirit, active in thinking and rigorous in style”. In its staff pool of over 550 people, there are two academicians of the Chinese Engineering Academy, one counselor of the State Council, 360 professional workers in which more than 200 people have senior professional titles (including 55 professors).

CAUPD has 3 studios and 12 institutes in Beijing, and 6 branch offices in [[Shanghai]], [[Shenzhen]], [[Chongqing]], [[Haikou]], [[Shantou]], and [[Xiamen]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31366">A '''Collections Management System''' ('''CMS'''), sometimes called a '''Collections Information System''', is [[software]] used by the collections staff of a collecting institution or by individual private collectors and collecting hobbyists or enthusiasts.  Collecting institutions are primarily [[museum]]s and [[archive]]s and cover a very broad range from huge, international institutions, to very small or niche-specialty institutions such as local historical museums and preservation societies.  Secondarily, [[libraries]] and [[Art gallery|galleries]] are also collecting institutions.   Collections Management Systems (CMSs) allow individuals or collecting institutions to organize, control, and manage their collections' objects by “tracking all information related to and about” those objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Sully | first=Perian | date=8 July 2006 | url=http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf | title=Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software | publisher=[[John F. Kennedy University]] | page=8 | accessdate=19 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In larger institutions, the CMS may be used by collections staff such as [[Registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[Collection manager|collections managers]], and [[curators]] to record information such as object locations, [[provenance]], curatorial information, conservation reports, professional appraisals, and exhibition histories. All of this recorded information is then also accessed and used by other institutional departments such as “education, membership, accounting, and administration."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ''MRM5: Museum Registration Methods'' (5th ed.), p. 161. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though early Collections Management Systems were cataloging databases, essentially digital versions of card catalogs, more recent and advanced systems are being used to improve communication between museum staff and to automate and manage collections-based tasks and workflows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Swank | first=Annamaria Poma | date=September 2008 | url=http://carlibrary.org/Collection-Management-Systems-Swank.pdf | title=Collections Management Systems | publisher=Carlibrary.org | format=[[PDF]] | page=15 | accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems are also used to provide access to information about an institution's collections and objects to academic researchers, institutional volunteers, and the public, increasingly through online methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Schmitt | first=Bob | date=10 October 2014 | url=http://carlibrary.org/CMS.htm | title=Collection Management Systems | accessdate=15 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and history of collections management systems==
Ever since machine-readable standards were developed for libraries in the 1960s, museums have had an interest in utilizing computers to record information about their collections. However, museums have very different needs from libraries; while bibliographic information about a library collection object is usually static, museum records are ever-changing because of the continuous need for new information about museum objects to be added to the records.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 11. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1967, the [[Museum Computer Network]] (MCN), an informal group of New York museums, attempted to create a collections management database called GRIPHOS, and at a [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] and [[IBM]] conference in 1968, speakers discussed current and proposed projects to automate collections management.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, pp. 23-24. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to coordinate research into developing these systems, professional associations such as the Museum Data Bank Coordinating Committee (MDBCC), formed in 1972, were created to disseminate information about computers and databases to museums interested implementing computerized collections systems.&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 29. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, Collections Management Systems became more advanced with the rise of relational databases that “[relate] each piece of data to every other piece,"&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 126. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and during this time some of today’s popular systems were originally developed for specific institutions “based on generic relational databases” — such as Gallery Systems' The Museum System for the Metropolitan Museum of Art and [http://rediscoverysoftware.com/welcome/ Re:discovery Software's Proficio] for the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s [[Monticello]] — before being released as commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C. (May 2010), [http://rcaam.org/cms/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Graduate-Studies-Thesis-Collections-Management-Elana-Carpinone.pdf Museum Collection Management Systems: One Size Does NOT Fit All], p. 19. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s, with computers becoming faster and cheaper and with the rise of the Internet, collections management software became much more sophisticated, able to “present images, sort information in any one of a myriad of configurations, record exhibition information, track locations, and interface with a museum Website."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 40. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the goal during the 1960s was to use computers for collections record-keeping for purposes of accountability, MCN Executive Director [[Everett Ellin]] warned that museum professionals should include public access as a goal because it would “not be worth the effort if museums only create a glorified record-keeping system."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 26. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Collections Management Systems have become crucial tools in increasing public access to collections information, expanding the types of information that are recorded. What was once “a simple tool for collections care and inventory” has become “a robust and powerful instrument for saving all information about museum objects," including interpretive material, digital objects, and digital surrogates. Since some Collections Management Systems now incorporate [[Digital asset management|Digital Asset Management]] and content information storage, many museum professionals have started to use the acronym CMS to stand for “[[Content management system|Content Management System]]."&lt;ref&gt;Sully, Perian (8 July 2006). [http://library2.jfku.edu/Museum_Studies/Inventory.pdf Inventory, Access, Interpretation: The Evolution of Museum Collection Software]. John F. Kennedy University, p. 3. Retrieved 19 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information managed in collections management systems==
In 1997, art historian and museum information studies consultant Robert A. Baron outlined the requirements for Collections Management Systems, not as a list of the kinds of collections object information that should be recorded, but rather as a list of collections activities such as administration, loan, exhibition, preservation, and retrieval,&lt;ref&gt;Swank, Annamaria Poma (September 2008). [http://carlibrary.org/Collection-Management-Systems-Swank.pdf Collections Management Systems], p. 15. Retrieved 15 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; tasks that museums had been responsible for long before the invention of computers, and many modern Collections Management Systems go beyond cataloging by aiding in the management of these processes and workflows.&lt;ref&gt;Schmitt, Bob (10 October 2014). [http://carlibrary.org/CMS.htm Collection Management Systems]. Retrieved 15 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Heritage Information Network]] (CHIN) Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist (CMSCC), which aims to be a comprehensive list of the kinds of information that a museum may want to record in a CMS, organizes that list by processes and actions rather than type of information. The checklist “outlines a number of features commonly included in a commercial CMS, which can assist a museum in determining which features have priority.”&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

===Object entry===
Managing and documenting information and tasks related to objects entering the museum, including acquisition or loan records, receipts, record of the reason for the deposit of the object, and record of the object’s return to its owner.

===Acquisition===
The management and documentation of objects added to the institution’s collection, including [[Accession number (library science)|accession numbers]], catalog numbers, object name or title, acquisition date, acquisition method, and transfer of title. There are many different accession numbering systems, and a CMS should allow an institution to use its existing numbering system.&lt;ref&gt;Carpinone, Elana C.

==Features of collections management systems==

===Functionality===

A Collections Management System should be able to store data, edit data, delete data, access data through queries, sort data, and output data in the form of reports.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), pp. 117-118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Data is stored in the form of tables and is entered into the system (and sometimes edited) using forms. Queries are searches that help retrieve specific data from the system, and reports “are the means by which the results of a query are displayed or printed."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flexibility===
An efficient CMS, like a good relational database, should not have duplicate records and should not require that the same information be recorded in more than one place in the system. At the same time, the system should be flexible enough to accommodate more data as the collections expand.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The user must also understand that not all information must be entered into a Collections Management System; for example, complex information such as complicated dimensions and measurements. Some institutions may not want to record confidential information such as private donor information in a CMS and instead keep it in a manual file or a separate, secure digital file, with pointers to the file’s location recorded in the CMS.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 169. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that such confidential information should be recorded in the CMS to protect the information in the event of a disaster where manual files may be destroyed.

===Backup and redundancy===
A CMS should have "a built in backup and recovery process" to protect data against not only equipment failure and disaster but also human error, which may result in loss or corruption of data. Redundant copies of the information should be stored in multiple locations, and the backup process may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data standards===
Because a computerized system “demands a much greater degree of precision in the use of language for cataloging and data retrieval than does a manual system,” data and [[metadata standards]] should be applied in a Collections Management System.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 173. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;  Data standards provide rules for how information is entered into the system, and data that has been entered into the system in a consistent manner allows for more accurate and precise [[information retrieval]] and for easier exchange of data between different systems.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;

The three types of data standards are structure, content, and value:

* Data structure standards describe the fields and categories of information (sometimes called elements) that are required to identify an object. In a museum CMS, these fields often include accession number, title/name of object, maker/creator of object, place of creation/origin, date of creation, dimensions, material, and source of object (for example, name of donor or seller).&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 122. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of widely used data structure standards used for cultural objects are the [[Dublin Core]] Metadata Element Set (DC), [[Categories for the Description of Works of Art]] (CDWA), the [[MARC standards|MARC]] formats, the element sets of Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO), and the VRA ([[Visual Resources Association]]) Core Categories.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng, Marcia Lei;Qin, Jian. (2008). Chapter 2: Current Standards. In ‘’Metadata’’ (pp.15-32). New York, NY: Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Data content standards provide guidelines for the formatting of information being entered into the fields, “controlling the syntax, style, grammar, and abbreviations” that should be used.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 172. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of data content standards used in institutions that collect cultural objects include Cataloging of Cultural Objects (CCO) and [[Describing Archives: A Content Standard]] (DACS).
* Data value standards provide the preferred terms and vocabulary to be used in the fields, often in the form of [[authority lists]], lexicons, [[Data Dictionaries|data dictionaries]], and thesauri. Examples include the Getty’s [[Art and Architecture Thesaurus]] (AAT) and [[Thesaurus of Geographic Names]] (TGN), Nomenclature 4.0 for Museum Cataloguing, and [[Iconclass]].&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), pp. 175-176. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt;
While most of these data standards apply to the cataloging and description of cultural objects, efforts are also being made to create data standards for natural history collections. Based on Dublin Core, the [[Darwin Core]] standard is a data structure standard for biodiversity information whose “glossary of terms” are the “fields” and “elements” needed to catalog biological and natural history specimens and samples.&lt;ref&gt;Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG). [http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/ Darwin Core]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Recognizing the importance of data standards to many users, some developers advertise that their Collections Management Systems are compliant with certain standards. For example, the Adlib Museum CMS is “certified as SPECTRUM compliant by the Collections Trust” and “also incorporates other international standards such as the ‘[[CIDOC]]’ guidelines and Getty ‘Object ID.’”&lt;ref&gt;Adlib Software. [http://www.adlibsoft.com/products/museum-collection-management-software Adlib Museum]. Retrieved 5 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Security and access===
A Collections Management System should have security measures that “ensure that only authorized persons are able to enter, edit, or view” information contained in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 162. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is a growing demand for public access to some of the collections and object information contained in the CMS, which “helps fulfill a museum's mission to educate the public and prove that the objects held in public trust are used to public benefit” while also encouraging collections staff to “support basic collection stewardship” by ensuring that information about the object is accurate before being made publicly accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne; Sully, Perian (2010). Computerized Systems. In Rebecca A. Buck; Jean Allman Gilmore (Eds.), ‘’MRM5: Museum Registration Methods’’ (5th ed.), p. 182. Washington, DC: AAM Press: American Association of Museums.&lt;/ref&gt; The system should allow the public to be able to make and refine searches of publicly accessible information in the system.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rights and reproductions===

A CMS should also allow collections staff to manage information on reproduction rights of the objects for which the institution is responsible, including type of copyright scheme being applied (for example, U.S. copyright or [[Creative Commons license]]), copyright ownership, and digital watermarks.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012).

Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations when selecting a system==
Since every museum has different needs, a museum should make a [[needs assessment]] before selecting a Collections Management System. The museum should determine what collections processes it needs the system to manage.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, Daniel B. (2008). Computers. In ‘’Registration Methods for the Small Museum’’ (4th ed.), p. 118. Lanham, MD: AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum should also identify who will be using the system and consider such factors as collection size (both present and future), staff technology skills, and budget/pricing.&lt;ref&gt;Kozak, Zenobia (Jan-Feb 2013), [https://www.historyassociates.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/2013-AAM-Jan-Feb-Museum-Mag-Article-Reprint.pdf How Do We Select a Collections Management System?] ‘’MUSEUM’’. American Association of Museums,. Retrieved 13 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Another recommendation is to map out both the short- and long-term goals for the new CMS and then determine how the system can help increase the museum's efficiencies. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.historyassociates.com/resources/blog/select-museum-cms-start-with-needs-assessment/|title=Start Your Museum CMS Selection Process with a Needs Assessment |publisher=HistoryAssociates.com |accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation information management systems==
Collections Management Systems have their origins in cataloging and registration, and consequently, most systems manage information and records “from a curatorial and collections management perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Heritage Information Network (2012). [http://www.rcip-chin.gc.ca/carrefour-du-savoir-knowledge-exchange/criteres_gestion_collections_management_checklist-eng.jsp Collections Management Software Criteria Checklist – 2012]. Retrieved 14 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation information in these systems is often limited to condition reporting and documentation of treatment history. While some advanced systems allow registrars to manage workflow tasks such as approvals and receipts, most systems are unable to manage conservation workflows. Many conservators also need a system that can not only store and manage conservation documentation but also easily share that information with other conservators and institutions.

Many Collections Management System developers have responded to this need by adding requested conservation features to their products. For example, in 2009, Gallery Systems, the developer of The Museum System (TMS), formed a consortium of stakeholders called the Conservation Working Group, to create a set of features to add to the conservation module of TMS.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems (2015). [http://www.gallerysystems.com/a-brief-history-of-conservation-studio/ A Brief History of Conservation Studio]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservators and institutions have taken a different approach, customizing existing software so that the system can manage conservation workflows. For example, at the [[Smithsonian National Postal Museum]] in 2012, former collections database administrator Kate Collen modified The Museum Systems’ conservation module so that it could manage object treatment processes, including assigning roles and responsibilities to multiple staff, ordering and prioritizing conservation tasks and treatments, separating treatment images from object images, automating registrar and lender approvals for treatments, and even tracking staff hours. This was achieved by renaming and remapping fields in the existing system, in some cases using fields for different purposes than originally intended by the software developer.&lt;ref&gt;Collen, Kate (2012). [https://www.dropbox.com/s/4vsnd3jf5g7rssr/Collen%2C%20Kate%20%282012%29.%20Making%20Conservation%20Work.pdf?dl=0 Making Conservation Work: Configuring the Conservation Module for the Smithsonian National Postal Museum]. Retrieved 14, November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some software developers have been developing standalone systems specifically for the purpose of managing conservation information and tasks. Since 2000, Inventive Software Solutions has been developing the Conservation Tracker System for the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]] to be “a comprehensive digital management tool for art conservation documentation.”&lt;ref&gt;Inventive Software Solutions. [http://www.inventivesoftware.net/Products/ConservationTracker.aspx Conservation Tracker System Overview]. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Developed since 2009 as a program of the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], ConservationSpace is a project “to develop an open-source software application that will address a core need of the conservation community for a shared solution to the problem of documentation management.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conservationspace.org/Home.html ConservationSpace] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219041630/http://conservationspace.org/Home.html |date=2014-12-19 }}. Retrieved 23 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Gallery Systems decided that adding incremental conservation features to The Museum System was no longer sufficient to meet the needs of conservators and began to develop a standalone web-based system to manage conservation processes called TMS Conservation Studio, which was released in summer of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Gallery Systems.

'''Conjecture (conjectural emendation)''' is a critical reconstruction of the original reading of a clearly corrupt, contaminated, nonsensical or illegible textual fragment. Conjecture is one of the techniques of [[textual criticism]] used by [[philologist]]s while commenting on or preparing editions of [[manuscript]]s (e.g. [[Biblical manuscript|biblical]] or other ancient texts usually transmitted in medieval copies). Conjecture is far from being just an educated guess and it takes an experienced expert with a broad knowledge of the author of the text, period, language and style of the time. Conjecture requires a close study of the text in its cultural and historical context and must be preceded with a thorough analysis of all [[extant literature|extant]] versions and readings of the given fragment. The [[paleography|knowledge of writing styles]] used by the [[scribe]]s throughout the transmission stages is also essential. Conjectural emendation must be clearly indicated in the [[critical apparatus]] or in the text itself.

Critical geography is one variant of&amp;nbsp;[[Critical theory|critical social science and humanities]]&amp;nbsp;that adopt&amp;nbsp;[[Karl Marx|Marx]]’s thesis to interpret and change the world. Fay (1987) defines contemporary critical science as the effort to understand the&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;in a society and use this understanding to promote societal change and liberation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_social_science.html?id=5K98AAAAIAAJ|title=Critical social science: liberation and its limits|last=Fay|first=Brian|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1987|isbn=9780801494581|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agger (1998) identifies a number of features of critical social theory practiced in fields like geography, which include: a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[positivism]]; an endorsement of the possibility of progress; a claim for the structural dynamics of&amp;nbsp;[[Social dominance theory|domination]]; an argument that dominance derived from forms of false consciousness, ideology, and myth; a faith in the agency of everyday change and self-transformation and an attendant rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[determinism]]; and a rejection of revolutionary expediency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Critical_Social_Theories.html?id=eB-B6XercZoC|title=Critical Social Theories: An Introduction|last=Agger|first=Ben|publisher=Avalon Publishing|year=1988|isbn=9780813321745|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin ==
Critical geography in the Anglo-American world rooted in the&amp;nbsp;'''radical geography'''&amp;nbsp;that emerged in the early 1970s. Peet (2000) provides an overview of the evolution of radical and critical geography.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Peet|first=Richard|year=2000|title=Celebrating Thirty Years of Radical Geography|journal=Environment and Planning A|language=en|volume=32|issue=6|pages=951–953|doi=10.1068/a32202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1970s, radical geographers tried to transform the scope of the discipline of geography by responding to the great issues of the time - civil rights, environmental pollution, and war. From the mid- to late-1970s saw ascending critiques of the&amp;nbsp;[[quantitative revolution]]&amp;nbsp;and the adoption of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism|Marxist]]&amp;nbsp;approach. The 1980s is marked by fissures between humanistic, feminist and Marxist streams, and a reversal of structural excess. In the late 1980s, critical geography emerged and gradually became a self-identified field.

Although closely related, critical geography and radical geography are not interchangeable. Critical geography has two crucial departures from radical geography: (1) a rejection of the structural excess of&amp;nbsp;[[Marxism]], in accordance with the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]]; and (2) an increasing interest in culture and&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]], in contrast to radical geography’s focus on the economy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Peet (2000) notices a rapprochement between critical and radical geography after heated debate in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Nevertheless, Castree (2000) posits that critical and radical geography entail different commitments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He contends that the eclipse of radical geography indicates the professionalization and academicization of Left geography, and therefore worries about the loss of the "radical" tradition.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Common themes ==
As a consequence of the&amp;nbsp;[[Postmodernism|post-modern turn]], critical geography doesn’t have a unified commitment. Hubbard, Kitchin, Bartley, and Fuller (2002) asserts that critical geography has a diverse&amp;nbsp;[[epistemology]],&amp;nbsp;[[ontology]], and&amp;nbsp;[[methodology]], and does not have a distinctive theoretical identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=71SvAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=thinking+geographically#v=onepage&amp;q=thinking%20geographically&amp;f=false|title=Thinking Geographically: Space, Theory and Contemporary Human Geography|last=Hubbard|first=Phil|last2=Bartley|first2=Brendan|last3=Fuller|first3=Duncan|last4=Kitchin|first4=Rob|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2002|isbn=9780567259882|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Blomley (2006) identifies six common themes of critical geography,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Blomley|first=Nicholas|year=2006|title=Uncritical critical geography?|journal=Progress in Human Geography|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–94|doi=10.1191/0309132506ph593pr}}&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing:
# '''A commitment to theory and a rejection of&amp;nbsp;[[empiricism]].'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers consciously deploy theories of some form, but they draw from a variety of theoretical wells, such as&amp;nbsp;[[political economy]],&amp;nbsp;[[governmentality]],&amp;nbsp;[[feminism]],&amp;nbsp;[[anti-racism]], and&amp;nbsp;[[anti-imperialism]].
# '''A commitment to reveal the processes that produce&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequalities]]'''. Critical geographers seek to unveil&amp;nbsp;[[Power (social and political)|power]], uncover&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]], expose resistance, and cultivate liberating politics and&amp;nbsp;[[social change]]s.
# '''An emphasis on&amp;nbsp;[[Social representation|representation]]&amp;nbsp;as a means of domination and resistance'''. A common focus of critical geography is to study how representations of space sustain power; or on the contrary, how representations of space can be used to challenge power.
# '''An optimistic faith in the power of critical scholarship'''. Critical geographers believe that scholarship can be used to resist the dominant representations, and scholar can undo power domination and free the oppressed. There exists an implicit confidence in the power of critical scholarship to reach the ignorant, and in the capacities of people to defeat alienation by means of reflexive self-education.
# '''A commitment to progressive practices'''. Critical geographers want to make a difference. They claim to be united with&amp;nbsp;[[social movement]]s&amp;nbsp;and activists with commitments to&amp;nbsp;[[social justice]]. The relationship between critical geography and&amp;nbsp;[[activism]]&amp;nbsp;has been much debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Radical_Theory_critical_Praxis.html?id=zGabDAEACAAJ|title=Radical Theory/critical Praxis: Making a Difference Beyond the Academy?|last=Fuller|first=Duncan|last2=Kitchin|first2=Rob|publisher=Praxis (e)Press|year=2004|isbn=9780973456103|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''An understanding of&amp;nbsp;[[space]]&amp;nbsp;as a critical tool.'''&amp;nbsp;Critical geographers pay special attention to how spatial arrangements and representations can be used to produce&amp;nbsp;[[oppression]]&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;[[Social inequality|inequality]]. Critical geographers identify to varying degrees how space can be used as both a veil and tool of power.

== Critiques ==
A few important questions remain unsolved in critical geography.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first one is that there has been relatively limited discussion over the shared commitments of critical geographers, with a few exceptions such as Harvey (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Spaces_of_Hope.html?id=W00VHZg3u2MC|title=Spaces of Hope|last=Harvey|first=David|publisher=University of California Press|year=2000|isbn=9780520225787|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The question such as "what are geographers critical of", and "to what end" needs to be answered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Barnes (2002) comments that critical geographers are better at providing explanatory diagnoses than offering anticipatory-utopian imaginations to reconfigure the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnes|first=Trevor J.|year=2002|title=Critical notes on economic geography from an aging radical. Or radical notes on economic geography from a critical age|url=https://ojs.unbc.ca/index.php/acme/article/view/687|journal=ACME: An International Journal for Critical Geographies|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|pages=8–14|issn=1492-9732|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second question concerns the institutionalization of critical geography. Even though critical geographers conceive themselves as rebels and outsiders, critical thinking has become prevalent in geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/maps-and-chaps-7142744|title=Maps and Chaps|last=Byles|first=Jeff|date=2001-07-31|work=Village Voice|access-date=2017-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critical geography is now situated at the very heart of the discipline of geography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some see institutionalization as a natural result of the analytical strength and insights of critical geography, while others fear that institutionalization has entailed cooperation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The question is whether critical geography still holds its commitment to political change.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Lastly, as critical geography is practiced across the world, the insights of critical geographers outside the Anglophone world should be better acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bialasiewicz|first=Luiza|year=2003|title=The Many Wor(l)ds of Difference and Dissent|journal=Antipode|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=14–23|doi=10.1111/1467-8330.00299|issn=1467-8330}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Mizuoka et al. (2005) offered an overview of Japanese critical geography praxis since the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mizuoka|first=Fujio|last2=Mizuuchi|first2=Toshio|last3=Hisatake|first3=Tetsuya|last4=Tsutsumi|first4=Kenji|last5=Fujita|first5=Tetsushi|year=2005|title=The Critical Heritage of Japanese Geography: Its Tortured Trajectory for Eight Decades|journal=Environment and Planning D: Society and Space|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=453–473|doi=10.1068/d2204r}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, critical geography should also forge stronger linkage with critical scholars in other disciplines.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11330">'''Cultural dissonance''' (education, [[sociology]], [[anthropology]] and cultural studies) is an  uncomfortable sense of discord, disharmony, confusion, or conflict experienced by people in the midst of change in their cultural environment. The changes are often unexpected, unexplained or not understandable due to various types of cultural dynamics.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"&gt;[http://adt.curtin.edu.au/theses/available/adt-WCU20020610.140633/  English speaking migrant children in educational and cultural transition.] Curtin University of Technology. (Thesis)&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies into cultural dissonance take on a wide socio-cultural scope of analysis that inquire into [[economics]], [[politics]], [[values]], [[learning styles]], cultural factors, such as [[language]], [[tradition]], [[ethnicity]], [[cultural heritage]], cultural [[history]], educational formats, classroom design, and even socio-cultural issues such as [[ethnocentricism]], [[racism]] and their respective historical legacies in the cultures.

==Research==
Research topics in cultural dissonance tend to be [[interdisciplinary]] drawing from a wide range of disciplines and applying the findings to equally diverse fields and industries.

Edward J. Hedican wrote an article in the Department of Sociology &amp; Anthropology at the [[University of Guelph]], [[Ontario]]. In it he  noted the possibility of alleviating acculturative pressures, and their disruptive effects on the sense of aboriginal sense of worth and identity. He proposed, "...the development of interethnic communication or ethnopolitics of community competence. This, in turn, will lead to increased native control over educational, economic, &amp; political institutions, decreased cultural dissonance, &amp; a more positive native identity." (Hedican)

Paul Bohannan wrote an "anthropological treatise" outlining "Seven organizing principles unique to humans: contract, role, ranking property, markets, networks, &amp; public relations. These characteristics are built on to analyze dyads, triads, &amp; chains, to show how innovation, as well as how cultural dissonance can lead to cultural traps." (Bohannan)

=== Education ===
Winifred L. Macdonald concluded in her thesis that, "... shared markers of language and ethnicity were not sufficient to ensure that the cultural differences in education systems were not experienced by the families." 
Macdonald also observed that cultural dissonance is sometimes said to inhibit socio-cultural adaptation.&lt;ref name="adt.curtin.edu.au"/&gt;

Susan Black, an education research consultant, wrote an article in the ''[[American School Board Journal]]'' of the [[National School Board Association]] that summarized some of the actions recommended by some researchers in education-related cultural dissonance. The recommendations for educators included:
# Recognize [[ethnocentrism]]
# Know and understand the student's [[cultural heritage]]
# Understand social, economic and political issues and [[value (ethics)|values]] in different cultures
# Adopt the attitude that students—all students—can [[learn]]
# Create genuinely caring classrooms where all students are appreciated and accepted.

Other general findings include: 
*Geneva Gay (University of Washington in Seattle, Washington), proposed that differences can erupt into cultural clashes
*Researchers at the Northwest Regional Educational Laboratory notes that many anecdotal case studies show how culturally responsive practices improve students' behavior and achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Black, Susan. American School Board Journal; Jan 2006, Vol. 193 Issue 1, p34-36, 3p&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second-generation immigrants ===
In their book ''Children of Immigration'', Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco discuss dissonance as it relates to [[Latino]]s in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Carola and Marcelo Suárez-Orozco, [http://www.hepg.org/her/booknote/112 "Children of Immigration"], Harvard University Press, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Suarez Orozco found that second-generation [[Hispanics]] face more acute forms of cultural dissonance than their first generation parents. They also noticed that second-generation individuals also face "special difficulties" that lead to "three general patterns of adjustment"
# attempts to [[:wikt:synthesize|synthesize]] two cultural traditions
# [[Passing (sociology)|passing]] as a member of the dominant group
# developing of defensive identity such as [[gang]] membership

=== Refugees of war ===
Suárez-Orozco also compared the experience of exiles from [[Cuba]] being reunited with family members with the "...alienated refugees from war-torn Central America..." as they worked through their own adjustment issues, and concluded that Central Americans had to deal with more cultural dissonance than their Cuban counterparts.

=== Law enforcement ===
Larry A. Gould wrote a paper for [[Northern Arizona University]]
"his research reports on the link between feelings of spirituality &amp; how Navajo police officers tend to enforce European-based law. Previous research suggests that a link exists between the officers' depth of feeling of spirituality &amp; the officers' attitude toward the effectiveness traditional methods of social control; however, this research goes a step further &amp; examines the impact of cultural dissonance on the stressors faced by Navajo police officers. The enforcement behavior of the Navajo officers was used as a proxy for the intensity of their feelings concerning the usefulness of traditional vs European-based forces of social control; the underlying assumption being tested is that self-determination is not only a state of law but a state of psychological being. A snowball method of sample development was used to select officers for intensive interviews. The findings suggest that the officers' feeling of spiritual connectedness to his/her culture is inversely related to the strictness of the enforcement of European-based laws. In other words, the more spiritual the officer, the less likely the officer is to rely solely on European-based laws, &amp; the greater the reliance on other methods of problems solving. The finding also suggest that in addition to the stressors normally encounter by all police officers, Navajo officers faced additional stressors that are specific to indigenous officers policing in indigenous communities. 1 Table, 41 References. Adapted from the source document." (Gould)

=== In sports ===
Tracy Taylor wrote a paper for the ''[[Journal of Sport and Social Issues]]''. In it she wrote "...This research investigates issues of cultural diversity &amp; inclusiveness in women's netball in Australia using the rhetoric of exclusion. Women &amp; girls from culturally diverse backgrounds spoke of reinforced difference &amp; cultural assimilation in their netball experiences. Women born in other English-speaking countries recalled feelings of inclusion &amp; limited cultural dissonance &amp; indicated that netball helped them feel as part of their new community &amp; gain social capital via participation. Although experiences of explicit exclusion or racial discrimination were virtually nonreported, some women felt a strong sense of cultural conformity to Anglo-centric expectations of behavior. The women's stories &amp; experiences suggest that women from culturally diverse backgrounds have found few opportunities to express their cultural distinctiveness through mainstream Australian sports such as netball. The conclusion reached after this examination is that the rhetoric of exclusion is pervasive in Australian netball &amp; unlikely to change in the near future. 1 Table, 76 References. [Reprinted by permission of Sage Publications Inc., copyright 2004.]" (Taylor)

==Cultural dissonance in popular culture==
Side 2 of the [[Firesign Theatre]]'s 1968 album, ''[[Waiting for the Electrician or Someone Like Him]]'', features a humorous 18-minute radio drama of a traveler experiencing cultural dissonance on his arrival in a foreign country. For example, the traveler struggles to communicate his wish to send a telegram, only to be informed that yes, his telegram has been sent, at considerable cost, and that he will be receiving it in about an hour.

Unlike [[heterotroph]]ic prokaryotes, cyanobacteria have internal membranes. These are flattened sacs called [[thylakoids]] where photosynthesis is performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Cyanobacteria: Molecular Biology, Genomics, and Evolution | chapter = Chapter 10.

[[Phototroph]]ic eukaryotes perform photosynthesis by [[plastid]]s that may have their ancestry in cyanobacteria, acquired long ago via a process called [[endosymbiosis]]. These endosymbiotic cyanobacteria in eukaryotes may have evolved or differentiated into specialized [[organelle]]s such as [[chloroplast]]s, [[etioplast]]s and [[leucoplast]]s.

By producing and releasing oxygen (as a byproduct of photosynthesis), cyanobacteria are thought to have converted the early oxygen-poor, [[reducing atmosphere]] into an [[redox|oxidizing]] one, causing the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] and the "rusting of the Earth",&lt;ref name="Whitton2012"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Whitton|editor-first=Brian A.|name-list-format=vanc|title=Ecology of Cyanobacteria II: Their Diversity in Space and Time|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4oJ_vi27s18C|page=17}}|date=5 July 2012|chapter=The fossil record of cyanobacteria|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-3855-3|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt; which dramatically changed the composition of the Earth's life forms and led to the near-extinction of [[anaerobic organism]]s.

==Description==
Cyanobacteria are a group of photosynthetic bacteria, some of which are [[nitrogen-fixing]], that live in a wide variety of moist soils and water either freely or in a symbiotic relationship with plants or [[lichen]]-forming [[Fungus|fungi]] (as in the lichen genus ''[[Peltigera]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =Dodds WK, Gudder DA, Mollenhauer D | year = 1995| title= T he ecology of ''Nostoc''|journal=Journal of Phycology|volume=31|pages=2–18|doi = 10.1111/j.0022-3646.1995.00002.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; They range from [[Unicellular organism|unicellular]] to [[filamentation|filamentous]] and include [[colony (biology)|colonial]] species. Colonies may form filaments, sheets, or even hollow spheres. Some filamentous species can differentiate into several different [[cell (biology)|cell]] types: '''vegetative cells''' – the normal, photosynthetic cells that are formed under favorable growing conditions; '''[[akinete]]s''' – climate-resistant spores that may form when environmental conditions become harsh; and thick-walled '''[[heterocysts]]''' – which contain the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], vital for [[nitrogen fixation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Meeks JC, Elhai J, Thiel T, Potts M, Larimer F, Lamerdin J, Predki P, Atlas R | title = An overview of the genome of Nostoc punctiforme, a multicellular, symbiotic cyanobacterium | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 70 | issue = 1 | pages = 85–106 | date = 2001 | pmid = 16228364 | doi = 10.1023/A:1013840025518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Golden_1998"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Golden JW, Yoon HS | title = Heterocyst formation in Anabaena | journal = Current Opinion in Microbiology | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = 623–9 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 10066546 | doi=10.1016/s1369-5274(98)80106-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay_1992"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fay P | title = Oxygen relations of nitrogen fixation in cyanobacteria | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 56 | issue = 2 | pages = 340–73 | date = June 1992 | pmid = 1620069 | pmc=372871}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an anaerobic environment due to its sensitivity to oxygen.&lt;ref name="Fay_1992" /&gt;

===Nitrogen fixation===
Some cyanobacteria can fix atmospheric [[nitrogen]] in anaerobic conditions by means of specialized cells called [[heterocyst]]s.&lt;ref name="Golden_1998" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fay_1992" /&gt; Heterocysts may also form under the appropriate environmental conditions (anoxic) when fixed nitrogen is scarce. Heterocyst-forming species are specialized for nitrogen fixation and are able to fix nitrogen gas into [[ammonia]] ({{Nh3}}), [[nitrites]] ({{No2-}}) or [[nitrates]] ({{No3-}}), which can be absorbed by plants and converted to protein and nucleic acids (atmospheric nitrogen is not [[bioavailable]] to plants, except for those having endosymbiotic [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria]], especially the [[Fabaceae]] family, among others).

Free-living cyanobacteria are present in the water of [[paddy field|rice paddies]], and cyanobacteria can be found growing as [[epiphyte]]s on the surfaces of the green alga, ''[[Chara (alga)|Chara]]'', where they may fix nitrogen.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ecology==
[[File:2010 Filamentous Cyanobacteria Bloom near Fiji.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Cyanobacterial bloom near [[Fiji]]]]
Cyanobacteria can be found in almost every terrestrial and [[aquatic habitat]]—[[ocean]]s, [[fresh water]], damp soil, temporarily moistened rocks in [[desert]]s, bare rock and soil, and even [[Antarctic]] rocks. They can occur as [[planktonic]] cells or form [[phototrophic biofilms]]. They are found in almost every [[endolithic ecosystem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = de los Ríos A, Grube M, Sancho LG, Ascaso C | title = Ultrastructural and genetic characteristics of endolithic cyanobacterial biofilms colonizing Antarctic granite rocks | journal = FEMS Microbiology Ecology | volume = 59 | issue = 2 | pages = 386–95 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17328119 | doi = 10.1111/j.1574-6941.2006.00256.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few are [[endosymbiont]]s in [[lichen]]s, plants, various [[protist]]s, or [[Sea sponge|sponges]] and provide energy for the [[Host (biology)|host]]. Some live in the fur of [[sloth]]s, providing a form of [[camouflage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Vaughan |first=Terry | name-list-format = vanc |title=Mammalogy |year=2011 |publisher=Jones and Barlett |page=21|url={{google books|plainurl=y|id=LD1nDlzXYicC|page=21}}|isbn=9780763762995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aquatic cyanobacteria are known for their extensive and highly visible [[Algal bloom|blooms]] that can form in both [[freshwater]] and marine environments. The blooms can have the appearance of blue-green paint or scum. These blooms can be [[toxic]], and frequently lead to the closure of recreational waters when spotted. [[Marine bacteriophage]]s are significant [[parasites]] of unicellular marine cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schultz |first=Nora |date=30 August 2009 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20327235.000-photosynthetic-viruses-keep-worlds-oxygen-levels-up.html |title=Photosynthetic viruses keep world's oxygen levels up |publisher=[[New Scientist]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria growth is favoured in ponds and lakes where waters are calm and have less turbulent mixing.&lt;ref name="JOHNK"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jöhnk|first1=Klaus D.|last2=Huisman|first2=Jef|last3=Sharples|first3=Jonathan|last4=Sommeijer|first4=Ben|last5=Visser|first5=Petra M.|last6=Stroom|first6=Jasper M.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Summer heatwaves promote blooms of harmful cyanobacteria|journal=Global Change Biology|date=1 March 2008|volume=14|issue=3|pages=495–512|doi=10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01510.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2007.01510.x/abstract|issn=1365-2486|bibcode=2008GCBio..14..495J}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their life cycles are disrupted when the water naturally or artificially mixes from churning currents caused by the flowing water of streams or the churning water of fountains. For this reason blooms of cyanobacteria seldom occur in rivers unless the water is flowing slowly. Growth is also favored at higher temperatures, making increasing water temperature as a result of [[global warming]] more problematic. At higher temperatures [[Microcystis]] species are able to outcompete [[diatoms]] and [[green algae]]. This is a concern because of the production of toxins produced by Microcystis.&lt;ref name=JOHNK /&gt;

Based on environmental trends, models and observations suggest cyanobacteria will likely increase their dominance in aquatic environments. This can lead to serious consequences, particularly the contamination of sources of [[drinking water]]. Cyanobacteria can interfere with [[water treatment]] in various ways, primarily by plugging filters (often large beds of sand and similar media), and by producing [[cyanotoxin]]s which have the potential to cause serious illness if consumed. Consequences may also lie within fisheries and waste management practices. Anthropogenic [[eutrophication]], rising temperatures, vertical stratification and increased [[atmospheric carbon dioxide]] are contributors to cyanobacteria increasing dominance of aquatic ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paerl HW, Paul VJ | title = Climate change: links to global expansion of harmful cyanobacteria | journal = Water Research | volume = 46 | issue = 5 | pages = 1349–63 | date = April 2012 | pmid = 21893330 | doi = 10.1016/j.watres.2011.08.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyanobacteria have been found to play an important role in terrestrial habitats. It has been widely reported that cyanobacteria [[soil crust]]s help to stabilize soil to prevent [[erosion]] and retain water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thomas AD, Dougill AJ | title = Spatial and temporal distribution of cyanobacterial soil crusts in the Kalahari: Implications for soil surface properties|journal=Geomorphology|date=15 March 2007|volume=85|issue=1|pages=17–29|doi=10.1016/j.geomorph.2006.03.029|bibcode=2007Geomo..85...17T}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a cyanobacterial species that does so is ''Microcoleus vaginatus''. ''M. vaginatus'' stabilizes soil using a [[polysaccharide]] sheath that binds to sand particles and absorbs water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Belnap|first1=Jayne|last2=Gardner|first2=John S.| name-list-format = vanc |title=Soil Microstructure in Soils of the Colorado Plateau: The Role of the Cyanobacterium Microcoleus Vaginatus | journal = The Great Basin Naturalist|date=1993|volume=53|issue=1|pages=40–47|doi=10.2307/41712756|jstor=41712756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these organisms contribute significantly to global ecology and the [[oxygen cycle]]. The tiny marine cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' was discovered in 1986 and accounts for more than half of the photosynthesis of the open ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Nadis S | title = The cells that rule the seas | journal = Scientific American | volume = 289 | issue = 6 | pages = 52–3 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14631732 | doi = 10.1038/scientificamerican1203-52 | url = http://guowei.ccps.tp.edu.tw/nc/UploadDocument/255_02%20The%20Cells%20that%20Rules%20the%20Sea.pdf | bibcode = 2003SciAm.289f..52N }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many cyanobacteria even display the [[circadian rhythm]]s that were once thought to exist only in eukaryotic cells (see [[bacterial circadian rhythms]]).
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Cyanobacteria are arguably the most successful group of [[microorganisms]] on earth. They are the most genetically diverse; they occupy a broad range of habitats across all latitudes, widespread in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems, and they are found in the most extreme niches such as hot springs, salt works, and hypersaline bays. [[Photoautotrophic]], oxygen-producing cyanobacteria created the conditions in the planet's early atmosphere that directed the evolution of aerobic metabolism and eukaryotic photosynthesis. Cyanobacteria fulfill vital ecological functions in the world's oceans, being important contributors to global carbon and nitrogen budgets." – Stewart and Falconer&lt;ref name="WalshSmith2011"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Walsh|editor-first1=Patrick J.|editor-last2=Smith|editor-first2=Sharon|editor-last3=Fleming|editor-first3=Lora|editor-first4=Helena |editor-last4=Solo-Gabriele |editor-first5=William H.|editor-last5= Gerwick| name-list-format = vanc |title=Oceans and Human Health: Risks and Remedies from the Seas|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=LMZPqW-PmFYC|page=271}}|date=2 September 2011|chapter=Cyanobacteria and cyanobacterial toxins|pp=271–296|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-08-087782-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Photosynthesis==
While contemporary cyanobacteria are linked to the [[plant kingdom]] as descendants of the progenitor of the endosymbiotic [[chloroplast]], there are several features which are unique to this group.

===Carbon fixation===
Cyanobacteria use the energy of [[sunlight]] to drive [[photosynthesis]], a process where the energy of light is used to synthesize [[organic compound]]s from carbon dioxide. Because they are aquatic organisms, they typically employ several strategies which are collectively known as a "carbon concentrating mechanism" to aid in the acquisition of inorganic carbon ({{CO2}} or [[bicarbonate]]). Among the more specific strategies is the widespread prevalence of the bacterial microcompartments known as [[carboxysome]]s.&lt;ref name="KerfeldHeinhorst2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kerfeld CA, Heinhorst S, Cannon GC | title = Bacterial microcompartments | journal = Annual Review of Microbiology | volume = 64 | issue = 1 | pages = 391–408 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20825353 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.micro.112408.134211 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Icosahedron|icosahedral]] structures are composed of hexameric shell proteins that assemble into cage-like structures that can be several hundreds of nanometers in diameter. It is believed that these structures tether the {{CO2}}-fixing enzyme, [[RuBisCO]], to the interior of the shell, as well as the enzyme [[carbonic anhydrase]], using [[metabolic channeling]] to enhance the local {{CO2}} concentrations and thus increase the efficiency of the RuBisCO enzyme.&lt;ref name="LongBadger2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Long BM, Badger MR, Whitney SM, Price GD | title = Analysis of carboxysomes from Synechococcus PCC7942 reveals multiple Rubisco complexes with carboxysomal proteins CcmM and CcaA | journal = The Journal of Biological Chemistry | volume = 282 | issue = 40 | pages = 29323–35 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17675289 | doi = 10.1074/jbc.M703896200 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electron transport ===
In contrast to [[purple bacteria]] and other bacteria performing [[anoxygenic photosynthesis]], thylakoid membranes of cyanobacteria are not continuous with the plasma membrane but are separate compartments.&lt;ref name="Vothknecht&amp;Westhoff20012"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Vothknecht UC, Westhoff P | title = Biogenesis and origin of thylakoid membranes | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1541 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 91–101 | date = December 2001 | pmid = 11750665 | doi = 10.1016/S0167-4889(01)00153-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The photosynthetic machinery is embedded in the [[thylakoid]] membranes, with [[phycobilisome]]s acting as [[Light-harvesting complex|light-harvesting antennae]] attached to the membrane, giving the green pigmentation observed (with wavelengths from 450&amp;nbsp;nm to 660&amp;nbsp;nm) in most cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="Sobiechowska-Sasim_2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sobiechowska-Sasim | first1 = Monika | last2 = Stoń-Egiert | first2 = Joanna | last3 = Kosakowska | first3 = Alicja | name-list-format = vanc | date = February 2014 | title = Quantitative analysis of extracted phycobilin pigments in cyanobacteria—an assessment of spectrophotometric and spectrofluorometric methods | journal=J Appl Phycol | volume = 26 | pages = 2065–2074 | doi=10.1007/s10811-014-0244-3| pmc = 4200375 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Cyanobacterium-inline.svg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Cyanobacterium-inline.svg|right|500x500px|Diagram of a typical cyanobacterial cell]]
While most of the high-energy [[electron]]s derived from water are used by the cyanobacterial cells for their own needs, a fraction of these electrons may be donated to the external environment via [[electrogenic]] activity.&lt;ref name="Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV 2010 e108212"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pisciotta JM, Zou Y, Baskakov IV | title = Light-dependent electrogenic activity of cyanobacteria | journal = PLOS One | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = e10821 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20520829 | pmc = 2876029 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0010821 | bibcode = 2010PLoSO...510821P | editor1-last = Yang | editor1-first = Ching-Hong | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Respiration ====
[[Cellular respiration|Respiration]] in cyanobacteria can occur in the thylakoid membrane alongside photosynthesis,&lt;ref name="Vermaas_2001"&gt;{{cite book | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1038/npg.els.0001670/abstract | title = Photosynthesis and Respiration in Cyanobacteria. eLS.| last = Vermaas | first = Wim FJ | name-list-format = vanc | date = 2001 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd | isbn = 978-0-470-01590-2 | doi = 10.1038/npg.els.0001670 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with their photosynthetic [[Electron transport chain|electron transport]] sharing the same compartment as the components of respiratory electron transport. While the goal of photosynthesis is to store energy by building carbohydrates from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respiration is the reverse of this, with carbohydrates turned back into CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; accompanying energy release.

Cyanobacteria appear to separate these two processes with their plasma membrane containing only components of the respiratory chain, while the thylakoid membrane hosts an interlinked respiratory and photosynthetic electron transport chain.&lt;ref name="Vermaas_2001" /&gt; Cyanobacteria use electrons from [[succinate dehydrogenase]] rather than from [[Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate|NADPH]] for respiration.&lt;ref name="Vermaas_2001" /&gt;

==== Electron transport chain ====
Many cyanobacteria are able to reduce nitrogen and carbon dioxide under [[Aerobic cellular respiration|aerobic]] conditions, a fact that may be responsible for their evolutionary and ecological success. The water-oxidizing photosynthesis is accomplished by coupling the activity of [[photosystem]] (PS) II and I ([[Z-scheme]]). In contrast to [[green sulfur bacteria]] which only use one photosystem, the use of water as an electron donor is energetically demanding, requiring two photosystems.&lt;ref name="Klatt_2016"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Klatt JM, de Beer D, Häusler S, Polerecky L | title = Cyanobacteria in Sulfidic Spring Microbial Mats Can Perform Oxygenic and Anoxygenic Photosynthesis Simultaneously during an Entire Diurnal Period | journal = Frontiers in Microbiology | volume = 7 | pages = 1973 | date = 2016 | pmid = 28018309 | doi = 10.3389/fmicb.2016.01973 | pmc=5156726}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attached to the thylakoid membrane, [[phycobilisome]]s act as [[Light-harvesting complex|light-harvesting antennae]] for the photosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grossman AR, Schaefer MR, Chiang GG, Collier JL | title = The phycobilisome, a light-harvesting complex responsive to environmental conditions | journal = Microbiological Reviews | volume = 57 | issue = 3 | pages = 725–49 | date = September 1993 | pmid = 8246846 | pmc = 372933 | doi =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The phycobilisome components ([[phycobiliprotein]]s) are responsible for the blue-green pigmentation of most cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.webexhibits.org/causesofcolor/5D.html|title=Colors from bacteria {{!}} Causes of Color|website=www.webexhibits.org|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variations on this theme are due mainly to [[carotenoid]]s and [[phycoerythrin]]s that give the cells their red-brownish coloration. In some cyanobacteria, the color of light influences the composition of the phycobilisomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | doi = 10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00250-9 | chapter = Cyanobacteria | title = Encyclopedia of Microbiology | edition = third | pages = 107–124 | first = F. | last = Garcia-Pichel | editor-first = Moselio | editor-last = Schaechter | name-list-format = vanc | isbn = 978-0-12-373944-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kehoe DM | title = Chromatic adaptation and the evolution of light color sensing in cyanobacteria | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 107 | issue = 20 | pages = 902930 | date = May 2010 | pmid = 20457899 | pmc = 2889117 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1004510107 | bibcode = 2010PNAS..107.9029K }}&lt;/ref&gt; In green light, the cells accumulate more phycoerythrin, whereas in red light they produce more [[phycocyanin]]. Thus, the bacteria appear green in red light and red in green light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kehoe DM, Gutu A | title = Responding to color: the regulation of complementary chromatic adaptation | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 57 | pages = 127–50 | date = 2006 | pmid = 16669758 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.arplant.57.032905.105215 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This process of complementary chromatic adaptation is a way for the cells to maximize the use of available light for photosynthesis.

A few genera lack phycobilisomes and have [[chlorophyll b]] instead (''[[Prochloron]]'', ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'', ''[[Prochlorothrix]]''). These were originally grouped together as the [[Prochlorophyta|prochlorophytes]] or chloroxybacteria, but appear to have developed in several different lines of cyanobacteria. For this reason, they are now considered as part of the cyanobacterial group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Palenik B, Haselkorn R | title = Multiple evolutionary origins of prochlorophytes, the chlorophyll b-containing prokaryotes | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6357 | pages = 265–7 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1731224 | doi = 10.1038/355265a0 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/355265a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..265P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Urbach E, Robertson DL, Chisholm SW | title = Multiple evolutionary origins of prochlorophytes within the cyanobacterial radiation | journal = Nature | volume = 355 | issue = 6357 | pages = 267–70 | date = January 1992 | pmid = 1731225 | doi = 10.1038/355267a0 | bibcode = 1992Natur.355..267U }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to chloroplasts==
{{See also|Chloroplast#Chloroplast lineages and evolution}}

Primary [[chloroplast]]s are cell [[organelle]]s found in some [[Eukarya|eukaryotic]] lineages, where they are specialized in performing the [[photosynthesis]]. They are known to have evolved from cyanobacteria through [[endosymbiosis]], i.e. after the engulfment of a cell by another. In this case, a photosynthesizing cyanobacteria that was engulfed in some ancient eukaryotic cell.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keeling PJ | title = The number, speed, and impact of plastid endosymbioses in eukaryotic evolution | journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology | volume = 64 | issue =  | pages = 583–607 | year = 2013 | pmid = 23451781 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-arplant-050312-120144 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After some years of debate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howe CJ, Barbrook AC, Nisbet RE, Lockhart PJ, Larkum AW | title = The origin of plastids | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London.

The [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarity between chloroplasts and cyanobacteria was first reported by German botanist [[Andreas Schimper]] in the 19th century&lt;ref name="Schimper"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Schimper, A.F.W.|title=Über die Entwicklung der Chlorophyllkörner und Farbkörper|trans-title=About the development of the chlorophyll grains and stains|language=German|journal=Bot.

In addition to this primary endosymbiosis, many eukaryotic lineages have been subject to [[Secondary endosymbiosis|secondary]] or even [[tertiary endosymbiotic events]], that is the "[[Matryoshka doll|Matryoshka]]-like" engulfment by a eukaryote of another plastid-bearing eukaryote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Archibald JM | title = The puzzle of plastid evolution | journal = Current Biology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = R81-8 | date = January 2009 | pmid = 19174147 | doi = 10.1016/j.cub.2008.11.067 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Within this evolutionary context, it is noteworthy that, as far as we can tell, [[oxygenic photosynthesis]] only evolved once (in cyanobacteria), and all other photosynthetic eukaryotes (including all plants and algae) have acquired this ability from them. In other words, all the oxygen that makes the atmosphere breathable for [[aerobic organism]]s originally comes from cyanobacteria or their later descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://phys.org/news/2017-03-oxygen-cyanobacteria.html |title=How do plants make oxygen?

==DNA repair==

Cyanobacteria are challenged by environmental stresses and internally generated [[reactive oxygen species]] that cause [[DNA damage (naturally occurring)|DNA damage]]s.  Cyanobacteria possess numerous ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]''-like [[DNA repair]] [[gene]]s.&lt;ref name="pmid27881980"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cassier-Chauvat C, Veaudor T, Chauvat F |title=Comparative Genomics of DNA Recombination and Repair in Cyanobacteria: Biotechnological Implications |journal=Front Microbiol |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1809 |date=2016 |pmid=27881980 |pmc=5101192 |doi=10.3389/fmicb.2016.01809 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several DNA repair genes are highly conserved in cyanobacteria, even in small [[genome]]s, suggesting that core DNA repair processes such as [[homologous recombination|recombinational repair]], [[nucleotide excision repair]] and methyl-directed [[DNA mismatch repair]] are common among cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="pmid27881980" /&gt;

The cyanobacteria were traditionally classified by morphology into five sections, referred to by the numerals I–V. The first three – [[Chroococcales]], [[Pleurocapsales]], and [[Oscillatoriales]] – are not supported by phylogenetic studies. The latter two – [[Nostocales]] and [[Stigonematales]] – are monophyletic, and make up the heterocystous cyanobacteria.&lt;ref name="Gugger_2004"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gugger MF, Hoffmann L | title = Polyphyly of true branching cyanobacteria (Stigonematales) | journal = International Journal of Systematic and Evolutionary Microbiology | volume = 54 | issue = Pt 2 | pages = 349–357 | date = March 2004 | pmid = 15023942 | doi = 10.1099/ijs.0.02744-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Howard-Azzeh M, Shamseer L, Schellhorn HE, Gupta RS | title = Phylogenetic analysis and molecular signatures defining a monophyletic clade of heterocystous cyanobacteria and identifying its closest relatives | journal = Photosynthesis Research | volume = 122 | issue = 2 | pages = 171–185 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 24917519 | doi = 10.1007/s11120-014-0020-x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The members of Chroococales are unicellular and usually aggregate in colonies. The classic taxonomic criterion has been the cell morphology and the plane of cell division. In Pleurocapsales, the cells have the ability to form internal spores (baeocytes). The rest of the sections include filamentous species. In Oscillatoriales, the cells are uniseriately arranged and do not form specialized cells (akinetes and heterocysts).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.preslia.cz/P144Komarek.pdf | title = Taxonomic classification of cyanoprokaryotes (cyanobacterial genera) 2014, using a polyphasic approach | vauthors = Komárek J, Kaštovský J, Mareš J, Johansen JR | journal = Preslia | volume = 86 | pages = 295–335 | year = 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Nostocales and Stigonematales, the cells have the ability to develop heterocysts in certain conditions. Stigonematales, unlike Nostocales, include species with truly branched trichomes.&lt;ref name="Gugger_2004" /&gt;

Most taxa included in the phylum or division Cyanobacteria have not yet been validly published{{according to whom|date=June 2016}} under the [[International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria|Bacteriological Code]], except:
*The classes [[Chroobacteria]], [[Hormogoneae]], and [[Gloeobacteria]]
*The orders [[Chroococcales]], [[Gloeobacterales]], [[Nostocales]], [[Oscillatoriales]], [[Pleurocapsales]], and [[Stigonematales]]
*The families [[Prochloraceae]] and [[Prochlorotrichaceae]]
*The genera ''[[Halospirulina]], [[Planktothricoides]], [[Prochlorococcus]], [[Prochloron]]'', and ''[[Prochlorothrix]]''
The remainder are validly published under the [[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]].

==Earth history==
[[Stromatolites]] are layered biochemical [[accretion (geology)|accretion]]ary [[structure]]s formed in shallow water by the trapping, binding, and cementation of sedimentary grains by [[biofilm]]s ([[microbial mat]]s) of [[microorganism]]s, especially cyanobacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author = Riding | year = 2007 | first = R. | title = The term stromatolite: towards an essential definition | journal = Lethaia | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 321–330 |doi = 10.1111/j.1502-3931.1999.tb00550.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Stromatolites.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Stromatolites]] left behind by cyanobacteria are the oldest known fossils of life on Earth. This one-billion-year-old fossil is from [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in Montana.]]
During the [[Precambrian]], stromatolite communities of microorganisms grew in most marine and non-marine environments in the photic zone. After the Cambrian explosion of marine animals, grazing on the stromatolite mats by herbivores greatly reduced the occurrence of the stromatolites in marine environments. Since then, they are found mostly in hypersaline conditions where grazing invertebrates cannot live (e.g. [[Shark Bay]], Western Australia). Stromatolites provide ancient records of life on Earth by fossil remains which might date from more than 3.5 [[annus#SI prefix multipliers|Ga]] ago, but this is disputed.&lt;ref name="PiP"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Patterns In Palaeontology: The first 3 billion years of evolution|first=Russell J.|last=Garwood|year=2012|journal=Palaeontology Online|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1–14|url=http://www.palaeontologyonline.com/articles/2012/patterns-in-palaeontology-the-first-3-billion-years-of-evolution/|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2010}} the oldest undisputed evidence of cyanobacteria is from 2.1 Ga ago, but there is some evidence for them as far back as 2.7 Ga ago.

The rise in oxygen may have caused a fall in the concentration of [[atmospheric methane]], and triggered the [[Huronian glaciation]] from around 2.4 to 2.1 Ga ago. In this way, cyanobacteria may have killed off much of the other bacteria of the time.&lt;ref name=Lane&gt;[[Nick Lane|Lane, Nick]] (6 February 2010) [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20527461-100-first-breath-earths-billion-year-struggle-for-oxygen/ "First breath: Earth's billion-year struggle for oxygen"].

Researchers from a company called [[Algenol]] have cultured genetically modified cyanobacteria in sea water inside a clear plastic enclosure so they first make sugar (pyruvate) from {{CO2}} and the water via photosynthesis. Then, the bacteria secrete ethanol from the cell into the salt water. As the day progresses, and the solar radiation intensifies, ethanol concentrations build up and the ethanol itself evaporates onto the roof of the enclosure. As the sun recedes, evaporated ethanol and water condense into droplets, which run along the plastic walls and into ethanol collectors, from where it is extracted from the enclosure with the water and ethanol separated outside the enclosure. As of March 2013, Algenol was claiming to have tested its technology in Florida and to have achieved yields of 9,000 US gallons per acre per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Algenol Biofuels exceeds 9,000 gallons of ethanol per year per|publisher=Algenol Biofuels|date=6 March 2013|url=http://www.algenolbiofuels.com/sites/default/files/press_releases/Production%20and%20Jobs%20Press%20Release%2003.08.2013.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140420020614/http://www.algenolbiofuels.com/sites/default/files/press_releases/Production%20and%20Jobs%20Press%20Release%2003.08.2013.pdf|archivedate=20 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; This could potentially meet US demands for ethanol in gasoline in 2025, assuming a B30 blend, from an area of around half the size of California’s San Bernardino County, requiring less than one-tenth of the area than ethanol from other biomass, such as corn, and only very limited amounts of fresh water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Jim | last = Lane | name-list-format = vanc | date = 25 September 2012 | url = http://www.biofuelsdigest.com/bdigest/2012/09/25/take-it-to-the-limit-algenol-and-rising-yields-in-advanced-biofuels/ | title = Take it to the Limit: Algenol and rising yields in advanced biofuels | journal = Biofuels Digest }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health risks==
{{main|Cyanotoxin}}
Cyanobacteria can produce [[neurotoxins]], [[cytotoxins]], [[endotoxins]], and [[hepatotoxins]] (e.g., the [[microcystin]]-producing bacteria genus [[microcystis]]), which are collectively known as [[cyanotoxin]]s.

Specific toxins include, [[anatoxin-a]], [[anatoxin-as]], [[aplysiatoxin]], cyanopeptolin, [[cylindrospermopsin]], [[domoic acid]], [[nodularin R]] (from ''[[Nodularia]]''), [[neosaxitoxin]], and [[saxitoxin]]. Cyanobacteria reproduce explosively under certain conditions. This results in [[algal bloom]]s, which can become [[Harmful algal blooms|harmful to other species]], and pose a danger to humans and animals, if the cyanobacteria involved produce toxins. Several cases of human poisoning have been documented, but a lack of knowledge prevents an accurate assessment of the risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thébault L, Lesne J, Boutin JP | title = [Cyanobacteria, their toxins and health risks] | journal = Medecine Tropicale | volume = 55 | issue = 4 | pages = 375–380 | year = 1995 | pmid = 8830224 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hc-sc1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080530024705/http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/ewh-semt/pubs/water-eau/cyanobacter_e.html Blue-Green Algae (Cyanobacteria) and their Toxins].

Recent studies suggest that significant exposure to high levels of cyanobacteria producing toxins such as [[beta-Methylamino-L-alanine|BMAA]] can cause [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS).
People living within half a mile of cyanobacterially contaminated lakes have had a 2.3 times greater risk of developing ALS than the rest of the population; people around New Hampshire's [[Lake Mascoma]] had an up to 25 times greater risk of ALS than the expected incidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Caller TA, Doolin JW, Haney JF, Murby AJ, West KG, Farrar HE, Ball A, Harris BT, Stommel EW | title = A cluster of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in New Hampshire: a possible role for toxic cyanobacteria blooms | journal = Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis | volume = 10 Suppl 2 | pages = 101–108 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19929741 | doi = 10.3109/17482960903278485 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemical control==
Several chemicals can eliminate cyanobacterial blooms from water-based systems. They include: [[calcium hypochlorite]], [[Copper(II) sulfate|copper sulphate]], cupricide, and [[simazine]].&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"&gt;{{cite web |last= Main |first= D.C. | name-list-format = vanc |title= Toxic Algae Blooms |work= Veterinary Pathologist, South Perth |publisher= agric.wa.gov.au |date= 2006 |url= http://archive.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/lwe/water/watq/fn052_2004.pdf |accessdate= 18 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The calcium hypochlorite amount needed varies depending on the cyanobacteria bloom, and treatment is needed periodically. According to the Department of Agriculture Australia, a rate of 12&amp;nbsp;g of 70% material in 1000&amp;nbsp;l of water is often effective to treat a bloom.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt; Copper sulfate is also used commonly, but no longer recommended by the Australian Department of Agriculture, as it kills livestock, crustaceans, and fish.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt; Cupricide is a chelated copper product that eliminates blooms with lower toxicity risks than copper sulfate.

Simazine is marketed at different strengths (25, 50, and 90%), the recommended amount needed for one cubic meter of water per product is 25% product 8&amp;nbsp;ml; 50% product 4&amp;nbsp;ml; or 90% product 2.2&amp;nbsp;ml.&lt;ref name="bluegreenalgae2006"/&gt;

==Dietary supplementation==
[[File:Spirulina tablets.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]] tablets]]
Some cyanobacteria are sold as food, notably ''[[Aphanizomenon flos-aquae]]'' and ''Arthrospira platensis'' ([[Spirulina (dietary supplement)|Spirulina]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spolaore P, Joannis-Cassan C, Duran E, Isambert A | title = Commercial applications of microalgae | journal = Journal of Bioscience and Bioengineering | volume = 101 | issue = 2 | pages = 87–96 | date = February 2006 | pmid = 16569602 | doi = 10.1263/jbb.101.87 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Defence Materials and Stores Research and Development Establishment''' ('''DMSRDE''') is a laboratory of the Indian [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located in GT Road, [[Kanpur]], it is responsible for the research and development of materials for the Indian military services, including various types of protective clothing and equipment.

==History==
The Defence Materials &amp; Stores Research &amp; Development Establishment (DMSRDE) was formed by renaming the Inspectorate of General Stores in the Harness &amp; Saddlery Factor in Cawnpore (present day Kanpur) in 1929. 

==Projects and Products==
DMSRDE had played important role in development of high tech non-metallic materials for the [[Indian Armed Forces]].&lt;ref name="toi"/&gt;

DMSRDE has developed Nuclear Shielding Pad, Boot Anti Mine, Blast Protection Suit, Bullet Proof Jackets, etc..&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-11/kanpur/29531480_1_technology-day-dmsrde-defence-equipment&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Defence Material and Stores Research Development Establishment in Kanpur has developed a new NBC suit that would be proved effective against any kind of dangerous weapons or chemicals and protect soldiers from any sort of attack," DMSRDE Director Arvind Kumar Saxena was quoted by media-persons. '''40,000 pieces of NBC suits costing about Rs 30,000''' had been requested by [[Indian army]]. "the further progress on the other two suits are going on." further quoted by media-persons.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecuritynewswire.org/gsn/nw_20110512_3514.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rediff.com/news/report/indian-army-may-soon-get-bio-chem-suits/20110511.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson''' (born 1946) is a Senior Lecturer in Law at the [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]], and Master of the undergraduate College's New Collegiate Division where he directs the Law, Letters, and Society program. His interests primarily lie in the field constitutional law, paying special attention to issues of race. Indeed, he is perhaps best known within the legal community at large for his work as Editor of the Law School's ''[[Supreme Court Review]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.uchicago.edu/faculty/hutchinson&lt;/ref&gt;

Hutchinson graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Bowdoin College]], and studied briefly as a JD candidate at Chicago before attending  [[Oxford University]] as a [[Rhodes Scholar]] in Jurisprudence, where he graduated with a BA and MA. Upon return to the United States, he completed his formal studies at the [[University of Texas Law School]], where he took an [[Master of Law|LLM]]. Hutchinson then served as a law clerk to Justice [[William O. Douglas]] and Justice [[Byron White]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. His biography of ''Whizzer White''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/h/hutchinson-whizzer.html&lt;/ref&gt; was a ''[[New York Times]]'' 'Notable Book' for 1998.  He was once married to Judge [[Diane Pamela Wood]], who sits on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit]], and who remains an academic colleague.

Hutchinson was one of several law faculty members who were called upon by various media sources to provide commentary about President Barack Obama's tenure teaching constitutional law at the school, and was largely supportive.

'''Educational music,'''  is a genre of music in which songs, lyrics, or other musical elements are used as a method of teaching and/or learning. It has been shown in research to promote learning.{{ref|songsforteaching}}{{ref|SmartSongs}} Additionally, music study in general has been shown to improve academic performance of students.{{ref|Standley2008}}{{ref|musichelps1}}{{ref|musichelps2}} &lt;br /&gt; 

Music used for learning can be in many formats, including video recordings, audio recordings, [[sheet music]], and [[improvised music]]. Most of the time, music is added to an existing lesson plan or story. Songs are usually easy to sing and catchy, so that they can be repeated for later learning. Some [[children's music]] is considered Educational, and, historically, most educational music is geared towards children. Prominent examples include songs from [[LazyTown]], ''[[Sesame Street]]'', ''[[Schoolhouse Rock]]'', [[Smart Songs]]' educational rap videos on YouTube, and [[Tom Lehrer]]'s songs for the [[PBS]] show ''[[The Electric Company]]''.

Recent developments have extended music's use to secondary and collegiate education, with [[Cornel West]] breaking new ground in this regard.{{ref|Cornish2001}}

== Forms ==
=== Video ===
Video recordings are the most use of educational music. Television shows, DVDs, and even some movies use music to teach the viewer, whether it be a moral lesson or a scholastic lesson. [[Sesame Street]] and [[Schoolhouse Rock]] are examples of shows that use music to teach topics like math, science, and government. Things like counting, the names of the planets, or the law making process are put to music with simple lyrics to aid in retention of information.

Shows such as [[Little Einsteins]] use music as a story aid to teach decision-making and music recognition. [[Instrumental music]] represents different objects, people, animals, or actions to help the viewer distinguish between various options.

Shows such as [[Veggie Tales]] use a story as well as music to teach biblical and moral lessons to its viewers. This form uses songs  to tie the story together and help the viewer remember important aspects of the story.

=== Audio ===
Audio music recordings are also used prominently as a form of education. The website Songs for Teaching&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.songsforteaching.com/ songsforteaching.com]&lt;/ref&gt; has many songs for teachers to use to help kids learn. Baby Genius is a very popular company that produces educational music CDs for children. 
The European Union funded an education project to encourage early language learning called Lullabies of Europe&lt;ref&gt;[http://lullabies-of-europe.org/ lullabies-of-europe.org]&lt;/ref&gt; that gathered and recorded lullabies in 7 European languages. Some Television shows and DVD series also make Audio recordings of their songs to further learning. 
*'''Sheet Music''' is sometimes used to aid in teaching when a song is new and the student can read music. Sheet music is usually used in conjunction with a CD or instrumentation.

=== Improvised ===
Improvisation is used in educational music in a few settings. Teachers might make up a song for times tables and teach it to the students, perhaps having students add parts. Some people also make up songs to remember things or to study for a test.

=== Hip hop ===
[[Hip-hop]] demonstrates increasing relevance and success as a pedagogical tool in primary and secondary education.  [[Flocabulary]] and Defined Mind,{{ref|Monitor}} focusing primarily on vocabulary building for [[SAT]] and [[ACT_(examination)]] tests, have established a Web presence in addition to their textbooks.  [[Smart Songs]],{{ref|Providence}} concentrating on middle school, offers amusing and pertinent music video. [[Rhythm, Rhyme, Results]] uses [[hip hop]] music to help students learn lessons ranging from economics to photosynthesis.{{ref|phoenix}} MC SKULE (Rohen Shah) of the non-profit SKULE.org makes parody music videos of popular songs where the lyrics teach math.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.michigandaily.com/section/news/daily-educational-rap-video-encourages-students-enjoy-math|title=On the Daily: Educational rapper gives math a new beat|work=The Michigan Daily|access-date=2017-04-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alex Kajitani]], the 2009 California State Teacher of the Year, created original middle school math songs as the Rappin' Mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nnstoy.org/stoy/alex-kajitani/|title=Alex Kajitani, California State Teacher of the Year 2009 - National Network of State Teachers of the Year|work=National Network of State Teachers of the Year|access-date=2017-08-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs that integrate music with education ==
=== Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA)===
Some schools integrate music with other subjects in the hope that the music and the other subjects enhance each other. With this mutual growth, educators hope to improve the overall quality and experiences of education.

One program that integrates music in education is the Changing Education Through the Arts (CETA) program, which is done through the [[Kennedy Center]]. CETA is a partnership between the Kennedy Center and eight arts focus schools in the [[Washington D.C.]] area. They work together to produce staff that can integrate the arts across the curriculum. CETA aims to integrate music and other arts, such as dance and visual arts, into other scholastic areas, such as math and science "...to teach and assess objectives in both the art form and the other subject area. This allows a simultaneous focus on creating, performing, and/or responding to the arts while still addressing content in other subject areas.”{{ref|CETA}}

The objectives of CETA are to:
# Develop the knowledge, skills, and beliefs in the arts among individual teachers so they can integrate the arts across the curriculum to enhance student learning 
# Purposefully network these individuals in their own schools and with teachers in participating schools to develop their understanding and confidence in integrating the arts across the curriculum 
# Provide an extensive system of internal and external support and resources to the teachers, schools, and the network
# Share knowledge and experiences with other educators and arts organizations both locally and nationally{{ref|CETA}}

=== Arts Horizons ===
Arts Horizons is an arts in education organization that serves schools in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]]. They integrate music, as well as other arts, into learning to help children gain appreciation for the arts as well as stimulate children “through the arts to improve their proficiency in reading, writing and math.”{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

Arts Horizons has a variety of programs, including:
* Interactive live performances by professional artists from Broadway, Lincoln Center and around the world 
* Artist in residence programs, custom-designed for your school, that make connections between the arts and the classroom curriculum 
* Three	Professional development inspires teachers to introduce innovative, creative approaches in the classroom and implement state learning standards.{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

An example of an assembly provided by Arts Horizons is the Peter and the Wolf program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://artshorizons.org/programs/images/wolf.jpg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725014759/http://artshorizons.org/programs/images/wolf.jpg |archivedate=2011-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this program, an actor tells the tale of Peter and the Wolf while a woodwind quintet plays the music of Prokofiev to bring the story to life. After the story, students have a chance to learn about the woodwind instruments that were used in the story, as well as other woodwind instruments, and hear other folk tales.{{ref|ArtsHorizons}}

== Effects of music on education ==
CETA has concrete evidence on the following:
* Rising student test scores on the state exams.  For example, Fort Hunt Elementary progressed from “not being accredited” to being “provisionally accredited” to being “fully accredited” within the course of three years.  
* Fewer student disciplinary referrals to the office.
* Higher attendance rates.
* Anecdotes by teachers about student learning in the arts and other subject areas.{{ref|CETA}}

There have been many studies on the use of music to aid in teaching, as well as how an individual who plays music fares in their education. Results show that using music when teaching children to read, for example, can help children learn how to read and give lasting results.{{ref|Standley2008}} A study on elementary students even showed that students with music training have overall better verbal memory, compared to the memory of those students of the same demographic without music training.{{ref|Chan2003}}

A '''flute circle''' is an organization of musicians which focuses on the [[Native American flute]].
Flute circles typically meet periodically to engage in educational and recreational
activities surrounding the instrument.
Most flute circles offer instruction on the Native American flute,
especially for flutists who are new to the instrument.
Many flute circles have a facilitator with experience in group music facilitation and
[[humanistic education|humanistic music education]]
to structure the activities and the music-making.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This use of the Native American flute in community music is notably different from traditional uses of the
instrument for courtship, hunting, or ceremony.&lt;ref name="Densmore1957"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This new use of the instrument has not been without controversy,
and flute circles are generally advised to use the instrument in a respectful manner because of
these considerations.&lt;ref name="Wapp1984a"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Flute circle participants may span a wide range of experience and training in music &amp;mdash;
from professionals to novice flutists or enthusiasts
of the Native American flute.&lt;ref name="WFS_Roster"&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2016-02-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many flute circles focus on raising the level of [[musicality]] of the participants
across a range of levels of musical experience using basic [[Ternary form|song forms]], [[Musical improvisation|music improvisation]], and techniques of experiential [[music education]].
These techniques include [[duet]] and [[Musical ensemble|ensemble]] improvisation forms that include [[Drone (music)|drone]]s, [[ostinato]] patterns, and [[call and response]] forms.&lt;ref name="Oshinsky2008"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–25}}
Facilitation forms include ''traveling ensembles'', ''showcasing'', ''segmenting'', and general ''conducted improvisations'' &amp;mdash;
techniques that are shared with other community music structures such as
[[drum circle]]s.&lt;ref name="Hull1998"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

While some flute circles focus on aspects of [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous cultures]]
and [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]],
they do not typically relate to a single culture or tribe.&lt;ref name="Howard"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Flute circles can also organize events for participants to play at events,
festivals, school presentations,
or in service settings such as senior centers, elder facilities, and group homes.
Flute circles have also engaged in their own concerts, produced music albums,
and broadcast live music performances.&lt;ref name="ThrivingFluteCircles"&gt;

== Community music ==

Flute circles are one type of community music gathering. Other types include [[drum circle]]s, community choirs, facilitated dance, and community orchestras. However, Mary Jane Jones argues in her thesis that flute circles have particular attributes not found in other types of community music gatherings:
{{quote |text=If the goal of flute players is to express themselves through a Native American-based musical means, it could be argued that they should be able to do that just as effectively through drumming or dancing. The answer may lie with the fact that, as a wind instrument, the flute uses not just the hands, but also the breath. Singing is the ultimate form of personal musical expression. The sound is formed from within the body and the words from within the mind. For people who feel that their voices are inadequate or are hindered from singing traditional Native songs because of their inability to speak their ancestral language, using the breath to produce sound through a simple cylinder may serve as a satisfying substitute. The flute can give them a voice.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis"&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|57}}}}

== Organizations ==

Several national organizations have formed to provide support to local flute circles:

* [http://worldflutesociety.org/ WFS] &amp;mdash; [[World Flute Society]] (U.S.A.)
* [http://flutetree.org/ FTF] &amp;mdash; FluteTree Foundation (U.S.A.) (formerly RNAFF, Renaissance of the North American Flute Foundation)
* [http://jifca.com/ JIFCA] &amp;mdash; Japan Indian Flute Circle Association (日本インディアンフルートサークル協会) (Japan)

A roster of registered flute circles is maintained by WFS&lt;ref name="WFS_Roster" /&gt;
and FTF.&lt;ref name="RNAFF_Roster"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistics ===

As of March 13, 2016, the roster of flute circles in this article listed 189 organizations in 9 countries, including flute circles in 44 States of the United States and 5 Provinces of Canada.

==== Historical ====
The chart below depicts the historical number of flute circles registered with the WFS (shown in darker blue) and its predecessor organization, the International Native American Flute Association ("INAFA") (shown in lighter blue).

The data for years prior to 2016 were gathered on March 13, 2016 from historical WFS and INAFA web pages provided by the [[Wayback Machine]].
The data for 2016 and 2017 were gathered from the live WFS web site on March 4, 2016 and January 3, 2017, respectively.

The data point for each year was taken on the first date in the year that the respective web site was updated. Data for the years 2012&amp;ndash;2014 represents the shift in organizations from INAFA to WFS.
The data roughly agrees with the Jones thesis, which reported 115 flute circles on the INAFA roster in 2010.&lt;ref name="JonesThesis" /&gt;{{rp|53}}

'''Folk science''' describes ways of understanding and predicting the natural and social world, without the use of rigorous methodologies (see [[Scientific method]]). One could label all understanding of nature predating the Greeks as "folk science".

Folk science is often accepted as "common wisdom" in a given culture, and gets passed on as [[meme]]s. According to some [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]], it may also reflect the output of evolved [[cognitive]] processes of the [[human mind]] which have been adapted in the course of [[human evolution]].

[[Scientific skepticism|Skeptics]] often investigate the influence and validity of folk science.

'''Gifted art''' (or '''free art''') is any form or piece of art that is given freely, whether to a city, a group of people, a community or an individual. It refers to any [[art]] that is distributed at no direct cost. It is a form of [[conceptual art]]. It comes from a belief that art should be available for all people to enjoy, whether rich or poor, university graduate or junior high dropout. Since Gifted Art is an expressive form of art - an idea, it encompasses virtually all forms of art: [[movie]]s, [[literature]], [[music record]]ings, [[sculpture]],&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6DF103AF935A25751C1A96F948260&lt;/ref&gt; [[painting]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/7730285.stm&lt;/ref&gt; [[graffiti]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.france24.com/france24Public/en/archives/news/culture/20070512-swoon-street-art-moma-urban-new-york-paris-l-j-beaubourg.php&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital art]], [[street performance]]s, [[performance art]], [[sticker art]], [[comic]]s, coffeehouse poetry and [[Internet art|Internet]]-distributed art etc.

== Short History ==
Gifted Art has a long history in the arts. Many artists have been known to give art freely to each other, in an effort to pass along ideas, etc. [[Picasso]] and many of his contemporaries were fond of this.
[[Duchamp]] was one of the first modern day artists to Gift to the public with his piece, ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'', for an art show in 1917. He gave the piece under the name of "R. Mutt," presumably to hide his identity as the artist. He actually had to pay $7 to have the piece exhibited in the show, and never intended on making any money from it. He gave it freely for all to see and to push forward the [[Dada]] movement.
In the 50's, [[Ray Johnson]] started doing [[Mail art]]. He spread the idea to many other artists&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thegalleriesatmoore.org/publications/johnsoncp.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and it still occurs today. In 2002, a 6&amp;nbsp;ft X 53&amp;nbsp;ft mural by [[Roy Lichtenstein]] was installed in the Times Square Subway Station in New York City. It was gifted by the artist to all New Yorkers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artfacts.net/index.php/pageType/exhibitionInfo/exhibition/36702/lang/1&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent years, Gifted Art has primarily been embraced by graffiti and urban artists. Many graffiti artists consider the work they do to be art for the public. Banksy writes in his books that he believes art is more important and more enjoyable when it is out on the street where people can view it in their everyday lives than when it hangs in a museum.

Many animals, including humans, tend to live in groups, [[herd]]s, [[flock (birds)|flocks]], bands, [[Pack (canine)|packs]], [[Shoaling and schooling|shoals]], or [[Bird colony|colonies]] (hereafter: groups) of conspecific individuals. The size of these groups, as expressed by the number of people/etc in a group such as 8 groups of 9 people in each one, is an important aspect of their social environment. Group size tend to be highly variable even within the same species, thus we often need statistical measures to quantify group size and statistical tests to compare these measures between two or more samples. Group size measures are notoriously hard to handle statistically since groups sizes typically follow an [[skewness|aggregated (right-skewed) distribution]]: most groups are small, few are large, and a very few are very large. 

Statistical measures of group size roughly fall into two categories.

==Outsiders' view of group size==

[[Image:Rook colonies smoothed 2.jpg|thumb|280px|Colony size measures for [[Rook (bird)|rook]]s breeding in Normandy. The distribution of colonies (vertical axis above) and the distribution of individuals (vertical axis below) across the size classes of colonies (horizontal axis). The number of individuals is given in pairs. Animal group size data tend to exhibit [[skewness|aggregated (right-skewed) distributions]], i.e. most groups are small, a few are large, and a very few are very large. Note that average individuals live in colonies larger than the average colony size. (Data from  Normandy, 1999-2000 (smoothed), Debout, 2003)]]

* Group size is the number of individuals within a group;
* '''Mean group size ''', the [[arithmetic mean]] of group sizes averaged over groups;
* '''[[Confidence interval]] for mean group size''';
* '''Median group size''', the [[median]] of group sizes calculated over groups;
* '''[[Confidence interval]] for median group size'''.

==Insiders' view of group size==

As Jarman (1974) pointed out, average individuals live in groups larger than average. Therefore, when we wish to characterize a typical (average) individual’s social environment, we should apply non-parametric estimations of group size. Reiczigel et al. (2008) proposed the following measures:

* '''Crowding''' is the size (the number of individuals) of a group that a particular individual lives in (equals to group size: 1 for a solitary individual, 2 for both individuals in a group of 2, etc.). Practically, it describes the social environment of one particular individual. This was called ''Individual Group Size'' in Jovani &amp; Mavor's (2011) paper.;
* '''Mean crowding''', i.e. the [[arithmetic mean]] of crowding measures averaged over individuals (this was called "Typical Group Size" according to Jarman's 1974 terminology);
* '''[[Confidence interval]] for mean crowding'''.

==Example==

Imagine a sample with 3 groups, where group sizes are 1, 2, and 6 individuals, respectively, then 
: '''mean group size''' (group sizes averaged over groups) equals &lt;math&gt;(1+2+6)/3=3&lt;/math&gt;;
: '''mean crowding''' (group sizes averaged over individuals) equals &lt;math&gt;(1+2+2+6+6+6+6+6+6)/9=4.555&lt;/math&gt;.

Generally speaking, given there are G groups with sizes n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ...,  n&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;, mean crowding can be calculated as:
: '''mean crowding'''=&lt;math&gt; \sum_{i=1}^G n^2_i/\sum_{i=1}^G n_i&lt;/math&gt;

==Statistical methods==

Due to the aggregated (right-skewed) distribution of group members among groups, the application of [[parametric statistics]] would be misleading. Another problem arises when analyzing crowding values. Crowding data consist of non-independent values, or ties, which show multiple and simultaneous changes due to a single biological event. (Say, all group members' crowding values change simultaneously whenever an individual joins or leaves.)

Reiczigel et al. (2008) discuss the statistical problems associated with group size measures (calculating [[confidence interval]]s, 2-sample tests, etc.) and offer a free statistical toolset (Flocker 1.1).

The idea of '''head music''' versus '''body music''' is an aesthetic idea in musicology.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Downes ''Aesthetics of Music: Musicological Perspectives''  2014 1136486917 p33  "Rock and roll has to be body music, before it can be head music, or it will wind up being neither' (Landau 1972, 134)."&lt;/ref&gt; The distinction has been illustrated by comparing [[rock n roll]] with [[progressive rock]], where the intention turned to innovation and experimentation, and "to offer 'head music' for thinking rather than body music for dancing".&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Partridge, Marcus Moberg   The Bloomsbury Handbook of Religion and Popular Music 2017 1474237355- Page 61  "With progressive rock, the programme was to innovate, to experimentformally, and to offer 'head music' for thinking rather than body music for dancing."&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Institute for International Economic Studies''' (IIES) is a Swedish research institute at [[Stockholm University]], founded in the early 1960s. The main objective is to produce outstanding research for publication in leading international journals. Scholars from the IIES have received a number of international awards, such as one [[Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences]] in Memory of Alfred Nobel, one [[Yrjö Jahnsson Award]] (given biannually since 1995 to "the best European economist below 45"), and five out of six [[Söderberg Prize]]s (given every four years since 1987 to "an outstanding Swedish economist"). Among many other honors, two IIES scholars have been elected Presidents of the [[European Economic Association]], one elected President of the [[Econometric Society]], three elected Foreign Honorary Members of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and six elected members of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. A number of IIES scholars hold positions on the Editorial boards of top international journals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3955">'''LGBT people in science''' are students, professionals, hobbyists, and anyone else who is [[LGBT]] and interested in [[science]].

There are traditions and expectations that LGBT people should not study or have careers in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Suri |first1=Manil |authorlink=Manil Suri |title=Why Is Science So Straight? |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/05/opinion/manil-suri-why-is-science-so-straight.html |website=The New York Times |date=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2016 the [[American Physical Society]] published a list of ways in which LGBT scientists have a more difficult career experience than their non-LGBT counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=American Physical Society |title=LGBT Climate in Physics |date=March 2016 |publisher=American Physical Society |isbn=978-0-9848110-7-6 |url=https://www.aps.org/programs/lgbt/upload/LGBTClimateinPhysicsReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some activists have speculated on whether the visibility of more LGBT [[role model|role models]] in science would make it easier for other LGBT students to join the sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Smith |first1=David |title='No sexuality please, we're scientists' |url=https://www.chemistryworld.com/opinion/no-sexuality-please-were-scientists/7197.article |website=Chemistry World |language=en |date=1 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report on a 2015 survey of United States undergraduate students found that gay students of science were more likely to change their major to a subject outside of science than non-LGBT students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=Bryce E. |title=Coming out in STEM: Factors affecting retention of sexual minority STEM students |journal=Science Advances |date=14 March 2018 |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=eaao6373 |doi=10.1126/sciadv.aao6373}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some academic commentators who study LGBT issues commented that LGBT students face social barriers to studying science which non-LGBT people do not experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Langin |first1=Katie |title=STEM is losing male LGBQ undergrads |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2018/03/stem-losing-male-lgbq-undergrads |website=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |language=en |date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various activist organizations used this study as supporting evidence that social changes could bring equal opportunity for LGBT people to study and have careers in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ruiz |first1=Rebecca |title=The culture of STEM may sideline aspiring queer scientists |url=https://mashable.com/2018/03/14/stem-lesbian-gay-bisexual-queer-students/#fOwNLkdtvGq5 |website=Mashable |language=en |date=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition that LGBT people are underrepresented in the sciences, various universities have programs to encourage more LGBT students to join their science programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Grijseels |first1=Dorieke |title=Out and About STEM: Why visibility of LGBT scientists is important |url=https://thebiochemistblog.com/2018/02/14/out-and-about-stem-why-visibility-of-lgbt-scientists-is-important/ |website=The Biochemist Blog |date=14 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''medical sign''' is an [[Objectivity (science)|objective]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition: 'Sign'|url=http://www.medilexicon.com/medicaldictionary.php?t=81800|work=Stedman's Medical Dictionary|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins via Medilexicon International Ltd.'s website, medilexicon.org|accessdate=12 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; indication of some medical fact or characteristic that may be detected by a patient or anyone, especially a [[physician]], before or during a [[physical examination]] of a [[patient]]. For example, whereas a tingling [[paresthesia]] is a [[symptom]] (only the person experiencing it can directly observe their own tingling feeling), [[erythema]] is a sign (anyone can confirm that the skin is redder than usual). Symptoms and signs are often [[sensitivity and specificity|nonspecific]], but often combinations of them are at least suggestive of certain [[diagnosis|diagnoses]], helping to narrow down what may be wrong. In other cases they are specific even to the point of being [[pathognomonic]].

Some signs may have no meaning to the patient, and may even go unnoticed, but may be meaningful and significant to the healthcare provider in assisting [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]].

Examples of signs include [[hypertension|elevated blood pressure]], a [[Nail clubbing|clubbing]] of the ends of fingers (which may be a sign of lung disease, or many other things), a staggering [[gait (human)]] and [[arcus senilis]] of the eyes.

The term ''sign'' is not to be confused with the term ''[[Indication (medicine)|indication]]'', which in medicine denotes a valid reason for using some treatment.

==Semiotics==
The art of interpreting clinical signs was originally called ''semiotics'' (a term now used for [[Semiotics|the study of sign communication in general]]) in English. This term, then written ''semeiotics'' (derived from the Greek adjective σημειωτικός: ''semeiotikos'', "to do with signs"), was first used in English in 1670 by [[Henry Stubbes]] (1631&amp;ndash;1676), to denote the branch of medical science relating to the interpretation of signs:

:...nor is there any thing to be relied upon in Physick, but an exact knowledge of medicinal phisiology (founded on observation, not principles), semeiotics, method of curing, and tried (not excogitated, not commanding) medicines....&lt;ref&gt;Stubbe, H. ([[Henry Stubbes]]), ''The Plus Ultra reduced to a Non Plus: Or, A Specimen of some Animadversions upon the Plus Ultra of Mr. Glanvill, wherein sundry Errors of some Virtuosi are discovered, the Credit of the Aristotelians in part Re-advanced; and Enquiries made...'' (London), 1670, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versus symptoms==
Signs are different from symptoms, the ''subjective'' experiences, such as [[fatigue (physical)|fatigue]], that patients might report to their examining physician.

For convenience, signs are commonly distinguished from symptoms as follows: Both are something abnormal, relevant to a potential medical condition, but a ''symptom'' is experienced and reported by the patient, while a ''sign'' is discovered by the physician during examination or by a clinical scientist by means of an [[in vivo]] examination of the patient.&lt;ref name="King 1982"&gt;{{Cite book |author=King, Lester S. |title=Medical Thinking: A Historical Preface |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, NJ |year=1982 |isbn=0-691-08297-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|75}}

A slightly different definition views signs as any indication of a medical condition that can be objectively observed (i.e., by someone other than the patient), whereas a symptom is merely any manifestation of a condition that is apparent to the patient (i.e., something consciously affecting the patient).  From this definition, it can be said that an asymptomatic patient is uninhibited by disease.  However, a doctor may discover the sign hypertension in an asymptomatic patient, who does not experience "dis-ease", and the sign indicates a disease state that poses a hazard to the patient.  With this set of definitions, there is some overlap &amp;ndash; certain things may qualify as both a sign and a symptom (e.g., a bloody nose).

Lester S. King, author of ''Medical Thinking'', argues that an "essential feature" of a sign is that there is both a sign [or "signifier"] and a "thing signified". And, because "the essence of a sign is to convey information", it can only be a sign, properly speaking, if it has meaning. Therefore, "a sign ceases to be a sign when you cannot read it".&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|73&amp;ndash;74}} A person, who has and exercises the knowledge required to understand the significance or indication or meaning of the sign, is necessary for something to be a complete sign. A physical phenomenon that is not actually interpreted as a sign pointing to something else is, in medicine, merely a symptom. Thus, King rejects "these present-day views [distinguishing signs from symptoms based on patient-subjective versus clinician-objective], however widely accepted, as quite faulty, at variance not only with ordinary usage but with the entire history of medicine."&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|77}}

&lt;blockquote&gt;"[A] symptom is a phenomenon, caused by an illness and observable directly in experience. We may speak of it as a '''manifestation''' of illness. When the observer reflects on that phenomenon and uses it as a base for further inferences, then that symptom is transformed into a sign. As a sign it points beyond itself — perhaps to the present illness, or to the past or to the future. That to which a sign points is part of its meaning, which may be rich and complex, or scanty, or any gradation in between. In medicine, then, a sign is thus a phenomenon from which we may get a message, a message that tells us something about the patient or the disease. A phenomenon or observation that does not convey a message is not a sign. The distinction between signs and symptom rests on the meaning, and this is not perceived but inferred."&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{Rp|81}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Types==
Medical signs may be classified by the type of inference that may be made from their presence, for example:

* '''[[Prognostic]] signs''' (from ''progignṓskein'', προγιγνώσκειν, "to know beforehand"): signs that indicate the outcome of the current bodily state of the patient (i.e., rather than indicating the name of the disease).&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|80}} Prognostic signs always point to the future. Perhaps the most famous prognostic sign is the [[facies Hippocratica]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[If the patient's facial] appearance may be described thus: the nose sharp, the eyes sunken, the temples fallen in, the ears cold and drawn in and their lobes distorted, the skin of the face hard, stretched and dry, and the colour of the face pale or dusky.… and if there is no improvement within [a prescribed period of time], it must be realized that this sign portends death."&lt;ref name="Chadwick 1978"&gt;{{cite book |author=Chadwick, J. &amp; Mann, W.N.(trans.) |title=Hippocratic writings |publisher=Penguin |location=Harmondsworth, UK |year=1978 |pages=170&amp;ndash;171 |isbn=0-14-044451-3 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''[[Medical history|Anamnestic]] signs''' (from ''anamnēstikós'', ἀναμνηστικός, "able to recall to mind"): signs that (taking into account the current state of a patient's body), indicate the past existence of a certain disease or condition.&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|81}} Anamnestic signs always point to the ''past''. (As King (1982) explains, whenever we see a man walking with a particular gait, with one arm paralysed in a particular way, we say "This man has had a stroke"; and, if we see a woman in her late 50s with one arm distorted in a particular way, we say "She had polio as a child".&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|81}})
* '''[[medical diagnosis|Diagnostic]] signs''' (from ''diagnōstikós'', διαγνωστικός, "able to distinguish"): signs that lead to the recognition and identification of a disease (i.e., they indicate the '''name''' of the disease).&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|81}}
*"'[[List of eponymously named medical signs]]"': signs named after people.
* '''[[Pathognomonic]] signs''' (from ''pathognomonikós'', παθογνωμονικός, "skilled in diagnosis", derived from ''páthos'', πάθος, "suffering, disease", and ''gnṓmon'', γνώμον, "judge, indicator"): the particular signs whose presence means, beyond any doubt, that a particular disease is present.&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|99&amp;ndash;100}} They represent a marked intensification of a diagnostic sign. (An example would be the palmar [[xanthoma]]ta seen on the hands of people suffering from [[hyperlipoproteinaemia]].) Singular pathognomonic signs are relatively uncommon.
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Symptoms become signs when they permit inference. Ordinarily, one single symptom by itself—such as pain or swelling, or discoloration, or bloody discharge—would not permit any specific inference, but when symptoms occur in clusters and form a pattern, then the aggregate might point to a particular disease. The pathognomonic sign, however, does not need any other manifestation to lead the physician to the correct diagnosis. It constitutes a one-to-one relationship—the sign and the disease are uniquely related. The pathognomonic sign was the "clincher", the datum that established the diagnosis unequivocally."&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{Rp|100}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Technological development creating signs detectable only by physicians==
Prior to the nineteenth century there was little difference in the powers of observation between physician and patient. Most medical practice was conducted as a joint co-operative interaction between the physician and his aristocratic patient as equals; this was gradually replaced by a "monolithic consensus of opinion imposed from within the community of medical investigators".&lt;ref name="Jewson 1974"&gt;Jewson, N. D., "[http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/8/3/369 Medical Knowledge and the Patronage System in 18th Century England]", ''Sociology'', Vol.8, No.3, (1974), pp. 369&amp;ndash;385.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewson 1976"&gt;Jewson, N. D., "[http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/10/2/225 The Disappearance of the Sick Man from Medical Cosmology, 1770&amp;ndash;1870]", ''Sociology'', Vol.10, No.2, (1976), pp. 225&amp;ndash;244.&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst each noticed much the same things, the physician had a more informed interpretation of those things: "the physicians knew what the findings meant and the layman did not".&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|82}}

===Advances in the 19th century===
However, the patient was gradually removed from the medical interaction&lt;ref name="Jewson 1974" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jewson 1976" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid3413276"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tsouyopoulos N |title=The mind-body problem in medicine (the crisis of medical anthropology and its historical preconditions) |journal=Hist Philos Life Sci |volume=10 Suppl |issue= |pages=55–74 |year=1988 |pmid=3413276 |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to significant technological advances such as:

* The 1808 introduction of the [[percussion (medicine)|percussion]] technique, "the process through which "the physician can assess the state of the underlying lung by sensing the character of vibrations by gentle taps on the chest wall [something which] greatly facilitated the diagnosis of pneumonia and other respiratory diseases".&lt;ref name="Weatherall"&gt;{{cite book |author=Weatherall, D. |title=Science and the Quiet Art: The Role of Medical Research in Health Care |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |location=New York |year= 1996|pages=46 |isbn=0-393-31564-9 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The techniques, which had been first described by the Viennese physician [[Leopold Auenbrugger]] (1722&amp;ndash;1809) in 1761, became far more widely known following the publication of [[Jean-Nicolas Corvisart]]'s (French) translation of Auenbrugger's (Latin) work in 1808.
* The 1819 introduction by [[René Laennec]] (1781&amp;ndash;1826) of the technique of [[auscultation]] (using a [[stethoscope]] to listen to the circulatory and respiratory functions of the body). Laennec's publication was translated into English, 1821&amp;ndash;1834, by [[John Forbes (physician)|John Forbes]].
* The 1846 introduction by surgeon [[John Hutchinson (surgeon)|John Hutchinson]] (1811&amp;ndash;1861) of the [[spirometer]], an apparatus for assessing the mechanical properties of the lungs via measurements of forced exhalation and forced inhalation. (The recorded [[lung volumes]] and air flow rates are used to [[Spirometry|distinguish between]] restrictive disease (in which the lung volumes are decreased: e.g., [[cystic fibrosis]]) and obstructive diseases (in which the lung volume is normal but the air flow rate is impeded; e.g., [[emphysema]]).)
* The 1851 invention by [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] (1821&amp;ndash;1894) of the [[ophthalmoscope]], which allowed physicians to examine the inside of the human eye.
* The (c.1870) immediate widespread clinical use of [[Clifford Allbutt|Sir Thomas Clifford Allbutt's]] (1836-1925) six inch (rather than twelve inch) pocket [[Medical thermometer|clinical thermometer]], which he had devised in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;Allbutt, T.C., "Medical Thermometry", British and Foreign Medico-Chirurgical Review, [https://archive.org/stream/britishforeignme45londuoft#page/428/mode/2up Vol.45, No.90, (April 1870), pp.429-441]; [https://archive.org/stream/britishforeignme46londuoft#page/144/mode/2up Vo.46, No.91, (July 1870), pp.144-156.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1882 introduction of bacterian cultures by [[Robert Koch]], initially for the [[tuberculosis]], being the first laboratory test to confirm bacterial infections.
* The 1895 clinical use of [[X-ray]]s which began almost immediately after they had been discovered that year by [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen]] (1845&amp;ndash;1923).
* The 1896 introduction of the [[sphygmomanometer]], designed by [[Scipione Riva-Rocci]] (1863&amp;ndash;1937), to measure [[blood pressure]].

===Alteration of the relationship between physician and patient===
The introduction of the techniques of percussion and auscultation into medical practice altered the relationship between physician and patient in a very significant way, specifically because these techniques relied almost entirely upon the physician listening to the sounds of the patient's body.

Not only did this development greatly reduce the patient's capacity to observe and contribute to the process of diagnosis, it also meant that the patient was often instructed to stop talking, and remain silent.

As these sorts of evolutionary changes continued to take place in medical practice, it was increasingly necessary to uniquely identify data that was accessible only to the physician, and to be able to differentiate those observations from others that were also available to the patient, and it just seemed natural to use "signs" for the class of physician-specific data, and "symptoms" for the class of observations available to the patient.

King proposes a more advanced notion; namely, that a sign is something that has meaning, regardless of whether it is observed by the physician or reported by the patient:
{{quote|The belief that a symptom is a subjective report of the patient, while a sign is something that the physician elicits, is a 20th-century product that contravenes the usage of two thousand years of medicine. In practice, now as always, the physician makes his judgments from the information that he gathers. The modern usage of signs and symptoms emphasizes merely the source of the information, which is not really too important. Far more important is the use that the information serves. If the data, however derived, lead to some inferences and go beyond themselves, those data are signs. If, however, the data remain as mere observations without interpretation, they are symptoms, regardless of their source. Symptoms become signs when they lead to an interpretation. The distinction between information and inference underlies all medical thinking and should be preserved.&lt;ref name="King 1982" /&gt;{{rp|89}}}}

==As tests==
In some senses, the process of diagnosis is always a matter of assessing the ''likelihood'' that a given condition is present in the patient. In a patient who presents with [[haemoptysis]] (coughing up blood), the haemoptysis is very much more likely to be caused by respiratory disease than by the patient having broken their toe. Each question in the history taking allows the medical practitioner to narrow down their view of the cause of the symptom, testing and building up their hypotheses as they go along.

Examination, which is essentially looking for clinical signs, allows the medical practitioner to see if there is evidence in the patient's body to support their hypotheses about the disease that might be present.

A patient who has given a good story to support a diagnosis of [[tuberculosis]] might be found, on examination, to show signs that lead the practitioner away from that diagnosis and more towards [[sarcoidosis]], for example. Examination for signs ''tests'' the practitioner's hypotheses, and each time a sign is found that supports a given diagnosis, that diagnosis becomes more likely.

Special tests (blood tests, [[radiology]], scans, a [[biopsy]], etc.) also allow a hypothesis to be tested. These special tests are also said to show signs in a clinical sense. Again, a test can be considered pathognonomic for a given disease, but in that case the test is generally said to be "diagnostic" of that disease rather than pathognonomic. An example would be a history of a fall from a height, followed by a lot of pain in the leg. The signs (a swollen, tender, distorted lower leg) are only very strongly suggestive of a fracture; it might not actually be broken, and even if it is, the particular kind of fracture and its degree of dislocation need to be known, so the practitioner orders an x-ray — and, for example, if the x-ray were to show a fractured [[tibia]], the film would be diagnostic of the fracture.

The '''medieval art''' of the [[Western world]] covers a vast scope of time and place, over 1000 years of art in [[Western art history|Europe]], and at times the Middle East and North Africa. It includes major art movements and periods, national and regional art, genres, revivals, the artists' crafts, and the artists themselves.

Art historians attempt to classify medieval art into major periods and styles, often with some difficulty.  A generally accepted scheme includes the later phases of [[Early Christian art]], [[Migration Period art]], [[Byzantine art]], [[Insular art]], [[Pre-Romanesque art and architecture|Pre-Romanesque]], [[Romanesque art]], and [[Gothic art]], as well as many other periods within these central styles. In addition each region, mostly during the period in the process of becoming  [[nation]]s or cultures, had its own distinct artistic style, such as [[Anglo-Saxon art]] or [[Norse art]].

Medieval art was produced in many media, and works survive in large numbers in [[sculpture]], [[illuminated manuscript]]s, [[stained glass]], [[metalwork]] and [[mosaic]]s, all of which have had a higher survival rate than other media such as [[fresco]] wall-paintings, work in precious metals or [[History of clothing and textiles#Medieval clothing and textiles|textile]]s, including [[tapestry]].  Especially in the early part of the period, works in the so-called "minor arts" or [[decorative arts]], such as metalwork, ivory carving, [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] and [[embroidery]] using precious metals, were probably more highly valued than paintings or [[monumental sculpture]].&lt;ref&gt;Heslop traces the beginning of the change to "around the twelfth century", quoted, 54; Zarnecki, 234&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval art in Europe grew out of the artistic heritage of the [[Roman art|Roman Empire]] and the [[Christian iconography|iconographic traditions]] of the [[early Christian church]]. These sources were mixed with the vigorous "barbarian" artistic culture of Northern Europe to produce a remarkable artistic legacy. Indeed, the history of medieval art can be seen as the history of the interplay between the elements of [[classical art|classical]], early Christian and "barbarian" art.&lt;ref&gt;Kitzinger (throughout), Hinks (especially Part 1) and Henderson (Chapters 1, 2 &amp; 4) in particular are concerned with this perennial theme. [https://books.google.com/books?id=kDNobJFWygcC&amp;pg=PA407&amp;lpg=PA407&amp;dq=Medieval+art+classical+barbarian+Gardner's&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AUZrn-wyQw&amp;sig=y2nS9GdW5mslQ8b5r7aRRr4119s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=m5KBStT8HIy5jAfaocSKCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Apart from the formal aspects of classicism, there was a continuous tradition of realistic depiction of objects that survived in Byzantine art throughout the period, while in the West it appears intermittently, combining and sometimes competing with new expressionist possibilities developed in Western Europe and the Northern legacy of energetic decorative elements.  The period ended with the self-perceived [[Renaissance]] recovery of the skills and values of classical art, and the artistic legacy of the [[Middle Ages]] was then [[Dark Ages (historiography)|disparaged]] for some centuries.  Since a revival of interest and understanding in the 19th century it has been seen as a period of enormous achievement that underlies the development of later Western art.

==Overview==

[[File:Lorenzetti amb.effect2.jpg|thumb|400px|Detail of ''The Effects of Good Government'', a [[fresco]] in the [[Palazzo Pubblico|City Hall of Siena]] by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]], 1338.]]

The [[Middle Ages]] in Europe saw a decrease in prosperity, stability, and population in the first centuries of the period—to about 800 AD, and then a fairly steady and general increase until the massive setback of the [[Black Death]] around 1350, which is estimated to have killed at least a third of the overall population in Europe, with generally higher rates in the south and lower in the north.  Many regions did not regain their former population levels until the 17th century.  The [[Medieval demographics|population of Europe]] is estimated to have reached a low point of about 18 million in 650, to have doubled around the year 1000, and to have reached over 70 million by 1340, just before the Black Death. In 1450 it was still only 50 million. To these figures, Northern Europe, especially Britain, contributed a lower proportion than today, and Southern Europe, including France, a higher one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/source/pop-in-eur.html Fordham University] Josiah Russell's figures - all estimates are of course very imprecise.  See [[Consequences of the Black Death]] for more details.&lt;/ref&gt;  The increase in prosperity, for those who survived, was much less affected by the Black Death. Until about the 11th century most of Europe was short of agricultural labour, with large amounts of unused land, and the [[Medieval Warm Period]] benefited agriculture until about 1315.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode = 2002AGUFMPP71C..09L | title=Little Ice Age and Medieval Warm Periods in Eastern China as Read from the Speleothem Records | journal=AGU Fall Meeting Abstracts | year=2002 | authors=Li, H.; Ku, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Courtly scenes Louvre MRR197.jpg|thumb|left|Scenes of [[courtly love]] on a lady's [[ivory]] mirror-case. Paris, 1300–1330.]]
The medieval period eventually saw the falling away of the invasions and incursions from outside the area that characterized the first millennium.  The [[Islamic conquests]] of the 6th and 7th century suddenly and permanently removed all of North Africa from the Western world, and over the rest of the period Islamic peoples gradually took over the [[Byzantine Empire]], until the end of the Middle Ages when Catholic Europe, having regained the Iberian peninsula in the southwest, was once again under Muslim threat from the southeast.

At the start of the medieval period most significant works of art were very rare and costly objects associated with secular elites, monasteries or major churches and, if religious, largely produced by monks.  By the end of the Middle Ages works of considerable artistic interest could be found in small villages and significant numbers of [[bourgeois]] homes in towns, and their production was in many places an important local industry, with artists from the [[clergy]] now the exception.  However the [[Rule of St Benedict]] permitted the sale of works of art by monasteries, and it is clear that throughout the period monks might produce art, including secular works, commercially for a lay market, and monasteries would equally hire lay specialists where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;22–23, and Chapter III&lt;/ref&gt;

The impression may be left by the surviving works that almost all medieval art was religious.  This is far from the case; though the church became very wealthy over the Middle Ages and was prepared at times to spend lavishly on art, there was also much secular art of equivalent quality which has suffered from a far higher rate of wear and tear, loss and destruction.  The Middle Ages generally lacked the concept of preserving older works for their artistic merit, as opposed to their association with a saint or founder figure, and the following periods of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]] tended to disparage medieval art.  Most luxury illuminated manuscripts of the Early Middle Ages had lavish [[treasure binding]] book-covers in precious metal, ivory and jewels; the re-bound pages and ivory [[relief]]s for the covers have survived in far greater numbers than complete covers, which have mostly been stripped off for their valuable materials at some point.

Most churches have been rebuilt, often several times, but medieval palaces and large houses have been lost at a far greater rate, which is also true of their fittings and decoration. In England, churches survive largely intact from every century since the 7th, and in considerable numbers for the later ones—the city of [[Norwich]] alone has 40 medieval churches—but of the dozens of royal palaces none survive from earlier than the 11th century, and only a handful of remnants from the rest of the period.&lt;ref&gt;The [[White Tower (Tower of London)]] was started in 1078, and some later royal apartments in the [[Tower of London]] survive, as do the hall and parts of [[Eltham Palace]], the most significant medieval remains from an unfortified royal palace. Royal apartments survive in some castles.&lt;/ref&gt;  The situation is similar in most of Europe, though the 14th century [[Palais des Papes]] in [[Avignon]] survives largely intact.  Many of the longest running scholarly disputes over the date and origin of individual works relate to secular pieces, because they are so much rarer - the Anglo-Saxon [[Fuller Brooch]] was refused by the [[British Museum]] as an implausible fake, and small free-standing secular bronze sculptures are so rare that the date, origin and even authenticity of both of the two best examples has been argued over for decades.&lt;ref&gt;the small Carolingian(?) ''Equestrian Statue of an Emperor'' in the [[Carnavalet Museum]] in Paris, Hinks, 125-7; and the 12th(?)-century bronze of a man wrestling with a lion, variously considered English, German or [[Sicily|Sicilian]] in origin, discussed by Henderson (1977), 135–139.&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of valuable materials is a constant in medieval art; until the end of the period, far more was typically spent on buying them than on paying the artists, even if these were not monks performing their duties.  [[Gold]] was used for objects for churches and palaces, personal jewellery and the fittings of clothes, and—fixed to the back of glass [[tesserae]]—as a solid background for [[mosaic]]s, or applied as [[gold leaf]] to miniatures in manuscripts and panel paintings.  Many objects using precious metals were made in the knowledge that their bullion value might be realized at a future point—only near the end of the period could money be invested other than in [[real estate]], except at great risk or by committing [[usury]].
[[File:Wilton diptych.jpg|thumb|360px|The small private [[Wilton Diptych]] for [[Richard II of England]], c. 1400, with stamped gold backgrounds and much [[ultramarine]].]]

The even more expensive [[pigment]] [[ultramarine]], made from ground [[lapis lazuli]] obtainable only from [[Afghanistan]], was used lavishly in the Gothic period, more often for the traditional blue outer mantle of the [[Virgin Mary]] than for skies.  [[Ivory]], often painted, was an important material until the very end of the period, well illustrating the shift in luxury art to secular works; at the beginning of the period most uses were shifting from [[consular diptych]]s to religious objects such as book-covers, [[reliquaries]] and [[crozier]]s, but in the Gothic period secular mirror-cases, caskets and decorated combs become common among the well-off.  As thin ivory panels carved in [[relief]] could rarely be recycled for another work, the number of survivals is relatively high—the same is true of manuscript pages, although these were often re-cycled by scraping, whereupon they become [[palimpsest]]s.

Even these basic materials were costly: when the Anglo-Saxon [[Monkwearmouth-Jarrow Abbey]] planned to create three copies of the bible in 692—of which one survives as the [[Codex Amiatinus]]—the first step necessary was to plan to breed the cattle to supply the 1,600 [[calf (animal)|calves]] to give the skin for the [[vellum]] required.&lt;ref&gt;Grocock, Chris has some calculations in [http://www.mayoalive.com/Mag1096/AbbyTalk.htm ''Mayo of the Saxons and Anglican Jarrow'', Evidence for a Monastic Economy], according to which sheep required only one third as much land per page as calves.  1,600 calves seems to be the standard estimate, see {{citation |last=John |first=Eric |title=Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England |year=1996 |publisher=Manchester University Press |location=Manchester |isbn=0-7190-5053-7 |page=14 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=7ju8AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA14#v=onepage&amp;q= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paper]] became available in the last centuries of the period, but was also extremely expensive by today's standards; [[woodcut]]s sold to ordinary pilgrims at shrines were often [[matchbook]] size or smaller.  Modern [[dendrochronology]] has revealed that most of the [[oak]] for panels used in [[Early Netherlandish painting]] of the 15th century was felled in the [[Vistula]] basin in Poland, from where it was shipped down the river and across the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[North Sea]]s to [[Flanders|Flemish]] ports, before being seasoned for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell (1998), 29 – the following pages describe gold, pigments and other materials.&lt;/ref&gt;

Art in the Middle Ages is a broad subject and art historians traditionally divide it in several large-scale phases, styles or periods.  The period of the Middle Ages neither begins nor ends neatly at any particular date, nor at the same time in all regions, and the same is true for the major phases of art within the period.&lt;ref&gt;Dates are discussed in Calkins (1979), xix-xx, Kitzinger (1955), 1, Beckwith (1964), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The major phases are covered in the following sections.

==Early Christian and Late Antique art==
{{Main|Early Christian art}}
[[File:Arco di Costantino (Roma) - tondo lato settentrionale destro.jpg|thumb|[[Arch of Constantine]], Rome, completed 315: The lower long [[relief]], with squat figures of size varying with status, is of that date, while the [[roundels]] are taken from a monument of nearly 200 years earlier, which maintains a classical style.]]

Early Christian art, more generally described as [[Late Antiquity|Late Antique]] art, covers the period from about 200 (before which no distinct Christian art survives), until the onset of a fully [[Byzantine art|Byzantine style]] in about 500.  There continue to be different views as to when the medieval period begins during this time, both in terms of general history and specifically art history, but it is most often placed late in the period.  In the course of the 4th century Christianity went from being a persecuted popular sect to the official religion of the Empire, adapting existing Roman styles and often [[iconography]], from both popular and Imperial art.  From the start of the period the main survivals of Christian art are the tomb-paintings in popular styles of the [[catacombs of Rome]], but by the end there were a number of lavish mosaics in churches built under Imperial patronage.

Over this period imperial Late [[Roman art]] went through a strikingly "baroque" phase, and then largely abandoned classical style and Greek realism in favour of a more mystical and hieratic style—a process that was well underway before Christianity became a major influence on imperial art.  Influences from Eastern parts of the Empire—[[Egypt]], [[Syria]] and beyond, and also a robust "Italic" vernacular tradition, contributed to this process. Figures are mostly seen frontally staring out at the viewer, where classical art tended to show a profile view - the change was eventually seen even on coins. The individuality of portraits, a great strength of Roman art, declines sharply, and the anatomy and drapery of figures is shown with much less realism. The models from which medieval Northern Europe in particular formed its idea of "Roman" style were nearly all portable Late Antique works, and the Late Antique carved [[sarcophagi]] found all over the former Roman Empire;&lt;ref&gt;Henderson (1977), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; the determination to find earlier "purer" classical models, was a key element in the art ''all'antica'' of the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;Hinks, chapters 1 &amp; 2, and Kitzinger, 1955, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Byzantine art==
{{Main|Byzantine art}}
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol1v.jpg|thumb|left|[[King David]] plays the [[harp]] in the 10th century [[Paris Psalter]], a classicising work of the Macedonian period.]]

Byzantine art is the art of the Greek-speaking Byzantine Empire formed after the division of the Roman Empire between Eastern and Western halves, and sometimes of parts of Italy under Byzantine rule.  It emerges from Late Antiquity in about 500 CE and soon formed a tradition distinct from that of Catholic Europe but with great influence over it.  In the early medieval period the best Byzantine art, often from the large Imperial workshops, represented an ideal of sophistication and technique which European patrons tried to emulate.  During the period of [[Byzantine iconoclasm]] in 730-843 the vast majority of [[icon]]s (sacred images usually painted on wood) were destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding, and most remaining works are in Italy (Rome and [[Ravenna]] etc.), or Egypt at [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]].

Byzantine art was extremely conservative, for religious and cultural reasons, but retained a continuous tradition of Greek realism, which contended with a strong anti-realist and hieratic impulse.   After the resumption of icon production in 843 until 1453 the Byzantine art tradition continued with relatively few changes, despite, or because of, the slow decline of the Empire.  There was a notable [[Macedonian art (Byzantine)|revival of classical style]] in works of 10th century court art like the [[Paris Psalter]], and throughout the period manuscript illumination shows parallel styles, often used by the same artist, for iconic figures in framed miniatures and more informal small scenes or figures added unframed in the margins of the text in a much more realist style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|pp=57–60}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monumental sculpture]] with figures remained a taboo in Byzantine art; hardly any exceptions are known.  But small ivory reliefs, almost all in the iconic mode (the [[Harbaville Triptych]] is of similar date to the Paris Psalter, but very different in style), were a speciality, as was relief decoration on bowls and other metal objects.

The Byzantine Empire produced much of the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with court production centred on [[Constantinople]], although some art historians have questioned the assumption, still commonly made, that all work of the best quality with no indication as to origin was produced in the capital. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental [[fresco]]s and [[mosaic]]s inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to [[mosques]].
[[File:L'abbé Ména et le Christ 01.JPG|thumb|6th or 7th century [[Coptic art|Coptic]] [[Icon of Christ and Abbot Mena|icon of Jesus and an abbot]] shares in more homely form the anti-realist style of Byzantine iconic art.]]

Byzantine art exercised a continuous trickle of influence on Western European art, and the splendours of the Byzantine court and monasteries, even at the end of the Empire, provided a model for Western rulers and secular and clerical patrons.  For example, [[Byzantine silk]] textiles, often woven or embroidered with designs of both animal and human figures, the former often reflecting traditions originating much further east, were unexcelled in the Christian world until almost the end of the Empire.  These were produced, but probably not entirely so, in Imperial workshops in Constantinople, about whose operations we know next to nothing—similar workshops are often conjectured for other arts, with even less evidence.  Some other decorative arts were less developed; Byzantine [[ceramic art|ceramics]] rarely rise above the level of attractive [[folk art]], despite the [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek heritage]] and the impressive future in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period of [[İznik pottery|İznik wares]] and other types of pottery.

The [[Coptic art]] of Egypt took a different path; after the [[Coptic Church]] separated in the mid-5th century it was never again supported by the state, and native Egyptian influences dominated to produce a completely non-realist and somewhat naive style of large-eyed figures floating in blank space.  This was capable of great expressiveness, and took the "Eastern" component of Byzantine art to its logical conclusions.  Coptic decoration used intricate geometric designs, often anticipating Islamic art.  Because of the exceptionally good preservation of Egyptian burials, we know more about the textiles used by the less well-off in Egypt than anywhere else.  These were often elaborately decorated with figurative and patterned designs.  Other local traditions in [[Armenia]], [[Syria]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and elsewhere showed generally less sophistication, but often more vigour than the art of [[Constantinople]], and sometimes, especially in [[architecture]], seem to have had influence even in Western Europe.  For example, figurative monumental sculpture on the outside of churches appears here some centuries before it is seen in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Atroshenko and Judith Collins cover the Eastern influences on Romanesque art in detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration Period through Christianization==
{{Main|Migration Period art}}
[[File:Sutton.Hoo.ShoulderClasp2.RobRoy.jpg|thumb|left|Shoulder-clasp from [[Sutton Hoo]], Anglo-Saxon, c. 620. Interlaced biting snakes and confronted [[boar]]s (end sections) are depicted entirely schematically.]]

Migration Period art describes the art of the "[[barbarian]]" Germanic and Eastern-European peoples who were on the move, and then settling within the former Roman Empire, during the [[Völkerwanderung|Migration Period]] from about 300-700; the blanket term covers a wide range of ethnic or regional styles including early [[Anglo-Saxon art]], [[Visigothic art]], [[Norse art]], and [[Merovingian art]], all of which made use of the [[animal style]] as well as geometric motifs derived from classical art.  By this period the animal style had reached a much more abstracted form than in earlier [[Scythian art]] or [[La Tène style]].  Most artworks were small and portable and those surviving are mostly jewellery and metalwork, with the art expressed in geometric or schematic designs, often beautifully conceived and made, with few human figures and no attempt at realism.  The early Anglo-Saxon [[grave good]]s from [[Sutton Hoo]] are among the best examples.

As the "barbarian" peoples were [[Christianization|Christianized]], these influences interacted with the post-classical Mediterranean Christian artistic tradition, and new forms like the [[illuminated manuscript]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 8 &amp; 9}}; {{Harvnb|Wilson|1984|pp=16–27}} on early Anglo-Saxon art.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed [[coin]]s, which attempted to emulate [[Roman provincial coins]] and [[Byzantine coinage|Byzantine]] types.  Early coinage like the [[sceat]] shows designers completely unused to depicting a head in profile grappling with the problem in a variety of different ways.

As for larger works, there are references to Anglo-Saxon wooden pagan statues, all now lost, and in Norse art the tradition of carved [[runestone]]s was maintained after their conversion to Christianity. The Celtic [[Picts]] of Scotland also [[Pictish stones|carved stones]] before and after conversion, and the distinctive Anglo-Saxon and Irish tradition of [[High cross|large outdoor carved crosses]] may reflect earlier pagan works.  [[Viking art]] from later centuries in [[Scandinavia]] and parts of the British Isles includes work from both pagan and Christian backgrounds, and was one of the last flowerings of this broad group of styles.

==Insular art==
{{Main|Insular art}}
[[File:LindisfarneFol27rIncipitMatt.jpg|thumb|[[Book of Lindisfarne]], [[Northumbria]], c. 715; decoration invades the text of the beginning of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]]:"Liber generationis Jesu Christi filii David, filii Abraham".]]

Insular art refers to the distinct style found in Ireland and Britain from about the 7th century, to about the 10th century, lasting later in Ireland, and parts of Scotland.  The style saw a fusion between the traditions of [[Celtic art]], the Germanic [[Migration period art]] of the [[Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxons]] and the Christian forms of the book, [[high cross]]es and liturgical metalwork.

Extremely detailed geometric, [[interlace (visual arts)|interlace]], and stylised animal decoration, with forms derived from secular metalwork like [[brooch]]es, spread boldly across manuscripts, usually [[gospel book]]s like the [[Book of Kells]], with whole [[carpet page]]s devoted to such designs, and the development of the large decorated and [[historiated initial]].  There were very few human figures—most often these were [[Evangelist portrait]]s—and these were crude, even when closely following Late Antique models.

The insular manuscript style was transmitted to the continent by the [[Hiberno-Scottish mission]], and its anti-classical energy was extremely important in the formation of later medieval styles.  In most Late Antique manuscripts text and decoration were kept clearly apart, though some initials began to be enlarged and elaborated, but major insular manuscripts sometimes take a whole page for a single initial or the first few words (see illustration) at beginnings of gospels or other sections in a book.  Allowing decoration a "right to roam" was to be very influential on Romanesque and Gothic art in all media.

The buildings of the monasteries for which the insular gospel books were made were then small and could fairly be called primitive, especially in Ireland.  There increasingly were other decorations to churches, where possible in precious metals, and a handful of these survive, like the [[Ardagh Chalice]], together with a larger number of extremely ornate and finely made pieces of secular high-status jewellery, the [[Celtic brooch]]es probably worn mainly by men, of which the [[Tara Brooch]] is the most spectacular.

"Franco-Saxon" is a term for a school of late Carolingian illumination in north-eastern France that used insular-style decoration, including super-large initials, sometimes in combination with figurative images typical of contemporary French styles. The "most tenacious of all the Carolingian styles", it continued until as late as the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dodwell|1993|pp=74(quote)–75}}, and see index.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of Islamic art==

{{main|Islamic influences on Western art}}
[[Islamic art]] during the Middle Ages falls outside the scope of this article, but it was widely imported and admired by European elites, and its influence needs mention.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, 324; Mack, Chapter 1, and passim throughout; [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/sumay/hd_sumay.htm The Art of the Umayyad Period in Spain (711–1031), Metropolitan Museum of Art timeline] Retrieved April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic art covers a wide variety of media including calligraphy, illustrated manuscripts, textiles, ceramics, metalwork and glass, and refers to the art of Muslim countries in the Near East, Islamic Spain, and Northern Africa, though by no means always Muslim artists or craftsmen.  [[Islamic glass|Glass production]], for example, remained a [[Jewish]] speciality throughout the period, and Christian art, as in [[Coptic art|Coptic Egypt]] continued, especially during the earlier centuries, keeping some contacts with Europe.  There was an early formative stage from 600-900 and the development of regional styles from 900 onwards.  Early Islamic art used mosaic artists and sculptors trained in the Byzantine and Coptic traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=256–262}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of wall-paintings, Islamic art used painted [[tile]]s, from as early as 862-3 (at the [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque]] of [[Kairouan]] in modern [[Tunisia]]), which also spread to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=269}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[John Ruskin]], the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] in [[Venice]] contains "three elements in exactly equal proportions — the Roman, the Lombard, and Arab. It is the central building of the world.&amp;nbsp;... the history of Gothic architecture is the history of the refinement and spiritualisation of Northern work under its influence".&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, paras 25 and 29]; discussed pp.&amp;nbsp;49–56 here [https://books.google.com/books?id=QzI3Pf0TSn4C&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=Ruskin+Orientalism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TF5qlcqm2M&amp;sig=PwSUx7Ghq5kozj-Y7AIWLOxPlk8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3AqjTfWYOpG4hAfP2tDWCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Ruskin%20Orientalism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Islamic rulers controlled at various points parts of Southern Italy and most of modern Spain and Portugal, as well as the [[Balkans]], all of which retained large Christian populations. The Christian [[Crusade]]rs equally ruled Islamic populations. [[Crusader art]] is mainly a hybrid of Catholic and Byzantine styles, with little Islamic influence, but the [[Mozarabic art]] of Christians in [[Al Andaluz]] seems to show considerable influence from Islamic art, though the results are little like contemporary Islamic works. Islamic influence can also be traced in the mainstream of Western medieval art, for example in the Romanesque portal at [[Moissac]] in southern France, where it shows in both decorative elements, like the scalloped edges to the doorway, the circular decorations on the [[lintel]] above, and also in having ''Christ in Majesty'' surrounded by musicians, which was to become a common feature of Western heavenly scenes, and probably derives from images of Islamic kings on their [[Divan (furniture)|diwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=206–209}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Calligraphy]], ornament and the [[decorative arts]] generally were more important than in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Dalu &amp; Michell, George, (eds); ''The Arts of Islam'', [[Arts Council of Great Britain]], 9, 1976, {{ISBN|0-7287-0081-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pre-Romanesque'' is a term for architecture and to some extent pictorial and portable art found initially in Southern Europe (Spain, Italy and Southern France) between the Late Antique period to the start of the Romanesque period in the 11th century.  Northern European art gradually forms part of the movement after [[Christianization]] as it assimilates post-classical styles.  The [[Carolingian art]] of the [[Frankish Empire]], especially modern France and Germany, from roughly 780-900 takes its name from [[Charlemagne]] and is an art of the court circle and a few monastic centres under Imperial patronage, that consciously sought to revive "Roman" styles and standards as befitted the new [[Holy Roman Empire|Empire of the West]].  Some centres of Carolingian production also pioneered expressive styles in works like the [[Utrecht Psalter]] and [[Ebbo Gospels]].  Christian [[monumental sculpture]] is recorded for the first time, and depiction of the human figure in narrative scenes became confident for the first time in Northern art.  [[Carolingian architecture]] produced larger buildings than had been seen since Roman times, and the [[westwork]] and other innovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hinks|1974|loc=Parts II &amp; III}}; {{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|loc=ch. 2}}; {{Harvnb|Calkins|1979|loc=chs 11 &amp; 12}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the collapse of the dynasty there was a hiatus before a new dynasty brought a revival in Germany with [[Ottonian art]], again centred on the court and monasteries, with art that moved towards great expressiveness through simple forms that achieve monumentality even in small works like [[ivory]] [[relief]]s and [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|manuscript miniatures]], above all those of the [[Reichenau School]], such as the [[Pericopes of Henry II]] (1002–1012).  Later [[Anglo-Saxon art]] in England, from about 900, was expressive in a very different way, with agitated figures and even drapery perhaps best shown in the many pen drawings in manuscripts.  The [[Mozarabic art and architecture|Mozarabic art]] of Christian Spain had strong Islamic influence, and a complete lack of interest in realism in its brilliantly coloured miniatures, where figures are presented as entirely flat patterns.  Both of these were to influence the formation in France of the Romanesque style.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=75–77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanesque art==
{{Main|Romanesque art}}
[[File:Saint-Julien 03.jpg|thumb|[[Tympanum (architecture)|Tympanum]] at [[Saint-Julien-de-Jonzy]], mid-12th century. ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' above, the ''[[Last Supper in Christian art|Last Supper]]'' below.]]

Romanesque art developed in the period between about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century, in conjunction with the rise of monasticism in Western Europe. The style developed initially in France, but spread to Christian Spain, England, Flanders, Germany, Italy, and elsewhere to become the first medieval style found all over Europe, though with regional differences.&lt;ref&gt;A complicated subject, covered in Dodwell (1993), 175, 223, 258 among many other passages.&lt;/ref&gt;  The arrival of the style coincided with a great increase in church-building, and in the size of [[cathedral]]s and larger churches; many of these were rebuilt in subsequent periods, but often reached roughly their present size in the Romanesque period.  [[Romanesque architecture]] is dominated by thick walls, massive structures conceived as a single organic form, with [[vault (architecture)|vault]]ed roofs and round-headed windows and arches.

Figurative sculpture, originally colourfully painted, plays an integral and important part in these buildings, in the [[Capital (architecture)|capitals]] of columns, as well as around impressive [[Portal (architecture)|portals]], usually centred on a [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] above the main doors, as at [[Vézelay Abbey]] and [[Autun Cathedral]].  Reliefs are much more common than free-standing statues in stone, but Romanesque relief became much higher, with some elements fully detached from the wall behind.  Large carvings also became important, especially painted wooden [[crucifix]]es like the [[Gero Cross]] from the very start of the period, and figures of the [[Virgin Mary]] like the [[Golden Madonna of Essen]].  Royalty and the higher clergy began to commission life-size effigies for [[tomb monument]]s.   Some churches had massive pairs of [[bronze]] doors decorated with narrative relief panels, like the [[Gniezno Doors]] or those at [[Hildesheim]], "the first decorated bronze doors cast in one piece in the West since Roman times", and arguably the finest before the Renaissance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|pp=145–149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most churches were extensively frescoed; a typical scheme had ''[[Christ in Majesty]]'' at the east (altar) end, a ''[[Last Judgement]]'' at the west end over the doors, and scenes from the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'' facing [[typology (theology)|typologically]] matching [[Old Testament]] scenes on the [[nave]] walls.  The "greatest surviving monument of Romanesque wall painting", much reduced from what was originally there, is in the [[Abbey Church of Saint-Savin-sur-Gartempe]] near [[Poitiers]], where the rounded [[barrel vault]] of the [[nave]], the [[crypt]], [[portico]] and other areas retain most of their paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henderson|1977|pp=190(quote)–195}}.&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent cycle in [[Sant'Angelo in Formis]] at [[Capua]] in southern Italy by Italian painters trained by Greeks illustrates the continuing predominance of Byzantine style in much of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 167-169&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Moralia in Job MS dragonslayer.jpg|thumb|left|French [[historiated initial]] with men slaying a monster, from a theological manuscript.  1110–1115]]

Romanesque sculpture and painting is often extremely vigorous and expressive, and very inventive in terms of [[iconography]]—the subjects chosen and their treatment.  Though many features absorbed from classical art form part of the Romanesque style, Romanesque artists rarely intended to achieve any sort of classical effect, except perhaps in [[Mosan art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|pp=277 &amp; 284–288}}. {{Harvnb|Beckwith|1964|p=149}}, says the bronze column at Hildesheim of c. 1020 "cannot be said to be Romanesque&amp;nbsp;... It stands apart as a curious Ottonian pastiche of a Roman monument&amp;nbsp;... never to be repeated"&lt;/ref&gt;  As art became seen by a wider section of the population, and because of challenges from new [[heresies]], art became more didactic, and the local church the "[[Poor Man's Bible]]".  At the same time grotesque beasts and monsters, and fights with or between them, were popular themes, to which religious meanings might be loosely attached, although this did not impress St [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who famously denounced such distractions in monasteries:&lt;blockquote&gt;But in the cloister, in the sight of the reading monks, what is the point of such ridiculous monstrosity, the strange kind of shapely shapelessness?  Why these unsightly monkeys, why these fierce lions, why the monstrous centaurs, why semi-humans, why spotted tigers, why fighting soldiers, why trumpeting huntsmen?&amp;nbsp;... In short there is such a variety and such a diversity of strange shapes everywhere that we may prefer to read the marbles rather than the books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p8csPCj2hPcC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=Bernard+of+Clairvaux+decoration|title=Bernard's letter |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= 2006-01-01|accessdate=2011-06-11|isbn=978-1-888570-85-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  He might well have known the miniature at left, which was produced at [[Cîteaux Abbey]] before the young Bernard was transferred from there in 1115.&lt;ref&gt;Dodwell (1993), 212–214. The MS is the [[Dijon]] ''[[Moralia in Job]]'' of [[Gregory the Great]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period [[typology (theology)|typology]] became the dominant approach in theological literature and art to interpreting the bible, with [[Old Testament]] incidents seen as pre-figurations of aspects of the life of Christ, and shown paired with their corresponding New Testament episode.  Often the iconography of the New Testament scene was based on traditions and models originating in Late Antiquity, but the iconography of the Old Testament episode had to be invented in this period, for lack of precedents.  New themes such as the [[Tree of Jesse]] were devised, and representations of [[God the Father]] became more acceptable.  The vast majority of surviving art is religious. [[Mosan art]] was an especially refined regional style, with much superb metalwork surviving, often combined with [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]], and elements of classicism rare in Romanesque art, as in the [[Baptismal font at St Bartholomew's Church, Liège]], or the [[Shrine of the Three Kings]] at [[Cologne]], one of a number of surviving works by [[Nicholas of Verdun]], whose services were sought across north-western Europe.

[[Stained glass]] became a significant art-form in the period, though little Romanesque glass survives.  In illuminated manuscripts the bible became a new focus of intensive decoration, with the [[psalter]] also remaining important.  The strong emphasis on the suffering of Christ and other sacred figures entered Western art in this period, a feature that strongly distinguishes it from both Byzantine and classical art for the remainder of the Middle Ages and beyond.  The Gero Cross of 965-970, at the cusp of Ottonian and Romanesque art, has been called the first work to exhibit this.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Honour|1982|p=271}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The end of the Romanesque period saw the start of the greatly increased emphasis on the [[Virgin Mary]] in theology, literature and so also art that was to reach its full extent in the Gothic period.

==Gothic art==
{{Main|Gothic art}}
[[File:Chartres cathedral 023 martyrs S TTaylor.JPG|thumb|left|[[Chartres cathedral]] c. 1220; the best High Gothic sculpture had largely rediscovered the art of naturalistic figure representation.]]
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with the [[Gothic architecture]] which developed in France from about 1137 with the rebuilding of the [[Basilica of St Denis|Abbey Church of St Denis]].  As with Romanesque architecture, this included [[Gothic sculpture|sculpture]] as an integral part of the style, with even larger [[Portal (architecture)|portals]] and other figures on the [[facade]]s of churches the location of the most important sculpture, until the late period, when large carved [[altarpiece]]s and [[reredos]], usually in painted and gilded wood, became an important focus in many churches.  [[Gothic painting]] did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style.  A [[Gothic sculpture|Gothic style in sculpture]] originates in France around 1144  and spread throughout Europe, becoming by the 13th century the international style, replacing Romanesque, though in sculpture and painting the transition was not as sharp as in architecture.

The majority of Romanesque cathedrals and large churches were replaced by Gothic buildings, at least in those places benefiting from the economic growth of the period—Romanesque architecture is now best seen in areas that were subsequently relatively depressed, like many  southern regions of France and Italy, or northern Spain.  The new architecture allowed for much larger windows, and stained glass of a quality never excelled is perhaps the type of art most associated in the popular mind with the Gothic, although churches with nearly all their original glass, like the [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris, are extremely rare anywhere, and unknown in Britain.

Most Gothic wall-paintings have also disappeared; these remained very common, though in parish churches often rather crudely executed.  Secular buildings also often had wall-paintings, although royalty preferred the much more expensive tapestries, which were carried along as they travelled between their many palaces and castles, or taken with them on military campaigns—the finest collection of late-medieval textile art comes from the Swiss booty at the [[Battle of Nancy]], when they defeated and killed [[Charles the Bold]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], and captured all his baggage train.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Historical Museum of Bern]] has many of the best pieces, and these and others were shown in an exhibition on Philip in Bern, Bruges and Vienna in 2008-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duccio maesta1021.jpg|thumb|The central panel of [[Duccio]]'s huge [[Maestà (Duccio)|Maestà]] [[altarpiece]] for [[Siena Cathedral]].]]
As mentioned in the previous section, the Gothic period coincided with a greatly increased emphasis on the Virgin Mary, and it was in this period that the [[Virgin and Child]] became such a hallmark of Catholic art.  Saints were also portrayed far more often, and many of the range of [[Saint symbolism|attributes]] developed to identify them visually for a still largely illiterate public first appeared.

During this period [[panel painting]] for altarpieces, often [[polyptych]]es and smaller works became newly important.  Previously [[icon]]s on panels had been much more common in Byzantine art than in the West, although many now lost panel paintings made in the West are documented from much earlier periods, and initially Western painters on panel were very largely under the sway of Byzantine models, especially in Italy, from where most early Western panel paintings come.  The process of establishing a distinct Western style was begun by [[Cimabue]] and [[Duccio]], and completed by [[Giotto]], who is traditionally regarded as the starting point for the development of Renaissance painting.  Most panel painting remained more conservative than miniature painting however, partly because it was seen by a wide public.
[[File:Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|300px|right|''Reconstruction of the temple of Jerusalem'', Burgundian miniature, c. 1460.]]

[[International Gothic]] describes courtly Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art begins to merge into the [[Renaissance art]] that had begun to form itself in Italy during the [[Trecento]], with a return to classical principles of composition and realism, with the sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]] and the painter [[Giotto]] as especially formative figures.  The [[Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] is one of the best known works of International Gothic.  The transition to the Renaissance occurred at different times in different places - [[Early Netherlandish painting]] is poised between the two, as is the Italian painter [[Pisanello]]. Outside Italy Renaissance styles appeared in some works in courts and some wealthy cities while other works, and all work beyond these centres of innovation, continued late Gothic styles for a period of some decades.  The [[Protestant Reformation]] often provided an end point for the Gothic tradition in areas that went Protestant, as it was associated with Catholicism.

The invention of a comprehensive mathematically based system of [[linear perspective]] is a defining achievement of the early-15th-century [[Italian Renaissance]] in [[Florence]], but Gothic painting had already made great progress in the naturalistic depiction of distance and volume, though it did not usually regard them as essential features of a work if other aims conflicted with them, and late Gothic sculpture was increasingly naturalistic. In the mid-15th century Burgundian miniature (right) the artist seems keen to show his skill at representing buildings and blocks of stone obliquely, and managing scenes at different distances.  But his general attempt to reduce the size of more distant elements is unsystematic. Sections of the composition are at a similar scale, with relative distance shown by overlapping, [[foreshortening]], and further objects being higher than nearer ones, though the workmen at left do show finer adjustment of size. But this is abandoned on the right where the most important figure is much larger than the mason.
[[File:Totentanz blockbook q.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Death comes for the Cardinal'', from a printed [[blockbook]] with hand colour, c. 1455–58, an early example of the [[Dance of Death]].]]

The end of the period includes new media such as [[old master print|prints]]; along with small panel paintings these were frequently used for the emotive [[andachtsbilder]] ("devotional images") influenced by new religious trends of the period.  These were images of moments detached from the narrative of the [[Passion of Christ]] designed for meditation on his sufferings, or those of the Virgin: the [[Man of Sorrows]], [[Pietà]], [[Veil of Veronica]] or [[Arma Christi]]. The trauma of the [[Black Death]] in the mid-14th century was at least partly responsible for the popularity of themes such as the ''[[Dance of Death]]'' and ''[[Memento mori]]''.  In the cheap [[blockbook]]s with text (often in the [[vernacular]]) and images cut in a single [[woodcut]], works such as that illustrated (left), the ''[[Ars Moriendi]]'' (''Art of Dying'') and typological verse summaries of the bible like the ''[[Speculum Humanae Salvationis]]'' (''Mirror of Human Salvation'') were the most popular.

[[Renaissance Humanism]] and the rise of a wealthy urban middle class, led by merchants, began to transform the old social context of art, with the revival of realistic portraiture and the appearance of printmaking and the [[self-portrait]], together with the decline of forms like stained glass and the illuminated manuscript.  [[Donor portrait]]s, in the Early Medieval period largely the preserve of popes, kings and abbots, now showed businessmen and their families, and churches were becoming crowded with the [[tomb monument]]s of the well-off.

The typical exuberantly decorated margins descend from [[insular art]], and are unlike anything in the Byzantine tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plummer|1964|loc=plates 1–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[book of hours]], a type of manuscript normally owned by laymen, or even more often, laywomen, became the type of manuscript most often heavily illustrated from the 14th century onwards, and also by this period, the lead in producing miniatures had passed to lay artists, also very often women.  In the most important centres of illumination, Paris and in the 15th century the cities of [[Flanders]], there were large workshops, exporting to other parts of Europe.  Other forms of art, such as small ivory reliefs, stained glass, tapestries and [[Nottingham alabaster]]s (cheap carved panels for altarpieces) were produced in similar conditions, and artists and craftsmen in cities were usually covered by the [[guild]] system—the [[goldsmith]]'s guild was typically among the richest in a city, and painters were members of a special [[Guild of St Luke]] in many places.

Secular works, often using subjects concerned with [[courtly love]] or [[chivalry|knightly heroism]], were produced as illuminated manuscripts, carved ivory mirror-cases, tapestries and elaborate gold table centrepieces like [[Nef (metalwork)|nefs]].  It begins to be possible to distinguish much greater numbers of individual artists, some of whom had international reputations.  Art collectors begin to appear, of manuscripts among the great nobles, like [[John, Duke of Berry]] (1340–1416) and of prints and other works among those with moderate wealth.  In the wealthier areas tiny cheap religious [[woodcut]]s brought art in an approximation of the latest style even into the homes of peasants by the late 15th century.

==Subsequent reputation==

Medieval art had little sense of its own art history, and this disinterest was continued in later periods.  The Renaissance generally dismissed it as a "barbarous" product of the "[[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]", and the [[Gothic architecture#The term "Gothic"|term "Gothic"]] was invented as a deliberately pejorative one, first used by the painter [[Raphael]] in a letter of 1519 to characterise all that had come between the demise of Classical art and its supposed 'rebirth' in the [[Renaissance]]. The term was subsequently adopted and popularised in the mid 16th century by the Florentine artist and historian, [[Giorgio Vasari]], who used it to denigrate northern European architecture generally. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be collected by [[antiquarian]]s, or sit unregarded in monastic or royal libraries, but paintings were mostly of interest if they had historical associations with royalty or others.  The long period of mistreatment of the [[Westminster Retable]] by [[Westminster Abbey]] is an example; until the 19th century it was only regarded as a useful piece of timber.  But their large portrait of [[Richard II of England]] was well looked after, like another portrait of Richard, the [[Wilton Diptych]] (illustrated above).  As in the Middle Ages themselves, other objects have often survived mainly because they were considered to be [[relic]]s.

There was no equivalent for pictorial art of the "[[Gothic survival]]" found in architecture, once the style had finally died off in Germany, England and [[Scandinavia]], and the [[Gothic Revival]] long focused on [[Gothic Architecture]] rather than art.  The understanding of the succession of styles was still very weak, as suggested by the title of [[Thomas Rickman]]'s pioneering book on English architecture: ''An Attempt to discriminate the Styles of English Architecture from the Conquest to the Reformation'' (1817).  This began to change with a vengeance by the mid-19th century, as appreciation of medieval sculpture and its painting, known as Italian or Flemish "Primitives", became fashionable under the influence of writers including [[John Ruskin]], [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]], and [[Augustus Welby Northmore Pugin|Pugin]], as well as the romantic [[medievalism]] of literary works like Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Ivanhoe]]'' (1819) and [[Victor Hugo]]'s ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1831).  Early collectors of the "Primitives", then still relatively cheap, included [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]].
[[File:Design for the Summer Smoking Room at Cardiff Castle.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[William Burges]]' design for the Summer Smoking Room at [[Cardiff Castle]], 1860s.]]

Among artists the German [[Nazarene movement]] from 1809 and English [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]] from 1848 both rejected the values of at least the later Renaissance, but in practice, and despite sometimes depicting medieval scenes, their work draws its influences mostly from the [[Early Renaissance]] rather than the Gothic or earlier periods - the early graphic work of [[John Millais]] being something of an exception.&lt;ref&gt;In works like [http://www.preraphaelites.org/the-collection/1906P646/the-death-of-romeo-and-juliet-compositional-study/ this], stylistically very different from the finished painting.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[William Morris]], also a discriminating collector of medieval art, absorbed medieval style more thoroughly into his work, as did [[William Burges]].[[File:Meister von Castelseprio 001.jpg|thumb|left|''Joseph's Dream'' from the Byzantinesque [[fresco]]s at [[Castelseprio]], the subject of much controversy since their discovery in 1944, and now generally dated to the 10th century.]]By the later 19th century many book-illustrators and producers of decorative art of various kinds had learned to use medieval styles successfully from the new museums like the [[Victoria &amp; Albert Museum]] set up for this purpose.  At the same time the new academic field of [[art history]], dominated by Germany and France, concentrated heavily on medieval art and was soon very productive in cataloguing and dating the surviving works, and analysing the development of medieval styles and iconography; though the Late Antique and pre-Carolingian period remained a less explored "no-man's land" until the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kitzinger|1955|pp=1(quote)–2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franz Theodor Kugler]] was the first to name and describe Carolingian art in 1837; like many art historians of the period he sought to find and promote the national spirit of his own nation in art history, a search begun by [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century.  Kugler's pupil, the great Swiss art historian [[Jacob Burckhardt]], though he could not be called a specialist in medieval art, was an important figure in developing the understanding of it.  Medieval art was now heavily collected, both by museums and private collectors like [[George Salting]], the [[Rothschild family]] and [[John Pierpont Morgan]].

After the decline of the [[Gothic Revival]], and the [[Celtic Revival]] use of Insular styles, the anti-realist and expressive elements of medieval art have still proved an inspiration for many modern artists.

German-speaking art historians continued to dominate medieval art history, despite figures like [[Émile Mâle]] (1862–1954) and [[Henri Focillon]] (1881–1943), until the Nazi period, when a large number of important figures emigrated, mostly to Britain or America, where the academic study of art history was still developing.  These included the elderly [[Adolph Goldschmidt]] and younger figures including [[Nikolaus Pevsner]], [[Ernst Kitzinger]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Kurt Weitzmann]], [[Richard Krautheimer]] and many others.  [[Meyer Schapiro]] had immigrated as a child in 1907.

== Prejudice ==
During the Middle Ages some Christian art was used as a way to express prejudices and commonly held negative views that were held against other religions and groups of people.

=== Jewish portrayals in medieval Christian art ===
[[File:Ecclesia et synagoga.jpg|thumb|Ecclesia and Sinagoga at the&amp;nbsp;Notre Dame Cathedral]]

In Medieval Europe between the 5th and 15th century many Christians viewed Jews as enemies and outsiders due to a variety of factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/jewm/hd_jewm.htm|title=Jews and the Arts in Medieval Europe|last=Holcomb|first=Barbara Drake|last2=Holcomb|first2=Melanie|date=June 2008|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also tended to hate them for being both culturally and religiously different as well as because of religious teachings that held negative views of Jewish people such as portrayals of the Antichrist as Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DdtSQ9v9T3IC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;lpg=PA383&amp;dq=Lipton+%22jewish+hat%22+enemies+of+Christ&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EqtM2kWlYN&amp;sig=2O0Qt5N7Wf9Ka_216Mh4F93xodc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-hpal5t_XAhVGqlQKHYCABtMQ6AEIQjAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lipton%20%22jewish%20hat%22%20enemies%20of%20Christ&amp;f=false|title=The Ashgate Research Companion to Monsters and the Monstrous|last=Mittman|first=Asa Simon|last2=Dendle|first2=Peter J.|date=2013|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|year=|isbn=9781472418012|location=|pages=383|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The Jewish people's economic position as moneylenders, coupled with royal protections that were given to them,{{Example needed|date=June 2018}} created a strained relationship between Jews and Christians. This strain manifested itself in several ways, one of which was through the creation of [[Medieval antisemitism|antisemitic]] and [[Anti-Judaism in early Christianity|anti-Judaism]] art and propaganda that served the purpose of discrediting both Jews and their religious beliefs as well as spreading these beliefs even further into society.  Late medieval images of [[Ecclesia and Synagoga]] represented the Christian doctrine of [[Supersessionism|supercessionism]], whereby the Christian [[New Covenant]] had replaced the Jewish [[Mosaic covenant]]&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Christine, "The Jewish Mother-in-law; Synagoga and the ''Man of Law's Tale''", pp. 8-11, in Delany, Sheila (ed), ''Chaucer and the Jews : Sources, Contexts, Meanings'', 2002, Routledge, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=T6YMJAuDAdEC&amp;pg=PA8 google books], {{ISBN|0-415-93882-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-93882-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sara Lipton has argued that some portrayals, such as depictions of Jewish blindness in the presence of Jesus, were meant to serve as a form of self-reflection rather than be explicitly anti-Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9f6gBAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq|title=Dark Mirror: The Medieval Origins of Anti-Jewish Iconography|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2014-11-04|publisher=Macmillan|year=|isbn=9780805079104|location=|pages=5|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2013 book ''Saracens, Demons, and Jews'', Debra Higgs Strickland argues that negative portrayals of Jews in medieval art can be divided into three categories: art that focused on physical descriptions, art that featured signs of damnation, and images that depicted Jews as monsters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Physical depictions of Jewish people in medieval Christian art were often men with pointed [[Jewish hat]]s and long beards, which was done as a derogatory symbol and to separate Jews from Christians in a clear manner. This portrayal would grow more virulent over time, however Jewish women lacked similar distinctive physical descriptions in high medieval Christian art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lipton|first=Sara|date=2008|title=Where Are the Gothic Jewish Women?

'''Midwestern State University''' is a public [[liberal arts college]] in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]] and a member of the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]]. In 2015, it had over 6,000 students.  Midwestern is one of four independent public universities in [[Texas]] unaffiliated with a state public university system. It is the state's only public [[liberal arts]] college.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thewichitan.com/liberal_arts_school/|title=MSU: Texas' only public liberal arts school - The Wichitan|date=2016-06-22|work=The Wichitan|access-date=2017-08-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Founded in 1922 as Wichita Falls Junior College, it was renamed Hardin Junior College in 1937, when it moved to its present location off Taft Boulevard. In 1946, a senior division was added and it was renamed Hardin College. In January 1950, the name changed to Midwestern University, with the junior college division remaining Hardin Junior College'. In these years, wider recognition came to the school. In March 1948, the university became a member of the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. In January 1959, the university added a graduate school which received full approval from the State Board of Education in August of that year.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;[http://www.mwsu.edu/about-mwsu/msu-history History]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hardin Tower.jpg|alt=Midwestern State University Hardin Tower|left|thumb|300x300px|Midwestern State University Hardin Tower]]
A further change in the school's status came September 1, 1961, when by action of the 56th session of the [[Texas State Legislature]], Midwestern University became part of the Texas Colleges and Universities System and the junior college division was dissolved. In 1975, the Texas Legislature changed the name to Midwestern State University.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

From its beginnings as a municipal junior college housed in a high school building, Midwestern has become a state university whose campus of 255 acres and 70 buildings offers a wide variety of academic programs in liberal and fine arts, mathematics, sciences, business, and applied sciences.&lt;ref name="History"/&gt;

On March 9, 2015, the university announced that Suzanne Shipley was selected to become its next president, following Jesse Rogers' retirement after 48 years of service to the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author =Dave Emke | title =Shipley chosen to become next president of Midwestern State | website =[[The Journal (West Virginia newspaper)|The Journal]] | date =March 9, 2015 | url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160306042821/http://www.journal-news.net/page/content.detail/id/630001/Shipley-chosen-to-become-next-president-of-Midwestern-State.html | accessdate = March 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 13, 2016, the university broke ground on a new campus in [[Flower Mound, Texas]]. The two-story facility will share space with [[North Central Texas College]] and is expected to open in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.crosstimbersgazette.com/2016/12/13/msu-nctc-officials-break-ground-in-flower-mound/|title=MSU, NCTC officials break ground in Flower Mound {{!}} The Cross Timbers Gazette|access-date=2017-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Midwestern State University is organized into seven colleges with 16 undergraduate programs offering 43 majors and 30 minors, and 9 graduate programs offering 28 majors and 15 minors.

MSU is the only university in Texas with membership in the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]] and was the first public university in Texas to establish a core curriculum. The university is also a member of the [[Association of American Colleges and Universities]] and the [[Association for Core Texts and Courses]].

==Traditions==
The University Seal is housed inside the Clark Student Center in the atrium. Legend says that if students step on the seal, they will not graduate in four years. Students actively avoid the seal when walking through the center.

Homecoming, an annual tradition at Midwestern State University, is normally held in October. Activities included during the week are the Cardboard Boat Race, Fish Fry, Lip-Sync Contest, Bonfire, Torchlight Parade, and the football game.

Students parade around campus the Thursday before the big homecoming game with torchlights at night. Students line up near Killingsworth Hall and parade down the street and towards the D.L. Ligon Coliseum parking lot, led by the Golden Thunder Band, which is the official marching band for Midwestern State University. They perform during the halftime of home football games. A smaller pep band performs during home basketball games.

Live at the Lake is a concert series held during the summer months at the Priddy Pavilion near Sikes Lake. The concert series is sponsored by the Wichita Falls Museum of Art at MSU.  
[[File:MSU-Burns Fantasy of Light.jpg|alt=The MSU-Burns Fantasy of Lights is an annual holiday lighting display organized on the Hardin lawn.|thumb|The MSU-Burns Fantasy of Lights is an annual holiday lighting display organized on the Hardin lawn.]]
On the Monday before every Thanksgiving, the university welcomes the community to the MSU-Burns Fantasy of Light opening ceremony. The Fantasy of Lights is a holiday light display organized on the Hardin Lawn in front of the Hardin Administration building every year. The tradition dates back to the 1970s, when the Fantasy of Lights was given to the university on the condition that the holiday displays always remain free to the public and are taken care of by the university.

A '''museum''' ({{IPAc-en|m|juː|ˈ|z|iː|əm}} {{respell|mew|ZEE|əm}}; plural '''museums''' or, rarely, '''musea''') is an institution that [[Preservation (library and archival science)|cares for]] (conserves) a [[collection (artwork)|collection]] of artifacts and other objects of [[art]]istic, [[culture|cultural]], [[history|historical]], or [[science|scientific]] importance.  Many public museums make these items available for public viewing through [[display case|exhibits]] that may be permanent or temporary.&lt;ref&gt;Edward Porter Alexander, Mary Alexander; {{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=owHSEk96qxQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Museums+history&amp;q= |title=Museums in motion: an introduction to the history and functions of museums |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2008 |accessdate=6 October 2009 |isbn=978-0759105096 |author1=Alexander, Mary |author2=Alexander, Edward Porter |date=September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The largest museums are located in major cities throughout the world, while thousands of local museums exist in smaller cities, towns and rural areas. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the [[general public]].

There are many types of museums, including art museums, natural history museums, science museums, war museums, and children's museums. Amongst the world's largest and most visited museums are the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]], the [[National Museum of China]] in [[Beijing]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[British Museum]] and [[National Gallery]] in London, the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] and [[Vatican Museums]] in [[Vatican City]].

As of the 2010s, the continuing acceleration in the [[Digitizing|digitization]] of information, combined with the increasing capacity of [[computer data storage|digital information storage]], is causing the traditional model of museums (i.e. as static bricks-and-mortar "collections of collections" of three-dimensional specimens and artifacts) to expand to include [[Virtual museum|virtual exhibits]] and high-resolution images of their collections that patrons can peruse, study, and explore from any location with Internet access.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} According to The World Museum Community, there are more than 55,000 museums in 202 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://icom.museum/resources/frequently-asked-questions/ Frequently Asked Questions] – The World Museum Community&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:State Historical Museum, Moscow, Russia.jpg|thumb|The [[State Historical Museum]] in [[Moscow]].]]

The English "museum" comes from the [[Latin]] word, and is pluralized as "museums" (or rarely, "musea"). It is originally from the [[Ancient Greek]] Μουσεῖον (''[[Musaeum|Mouseion]]''), which denotes a place or temple dedicated to the [[Muse]]s (the patron divinities in [[Greek mythology]] of the arts), and hence a building set apart for study and the arts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Findlen |first=Paula |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1989 |month= |title=The Museum: its classical etymology and renaissance genealogy |journal=Journal of the History of Collections |volume=1 |issue= 1|pages=59–78 |id= |url=http://jhc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/1/1/59 |accessdate= 5 April 2008 |quote=|doi=10.1093/jhc/1.1.59 }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the [[Musaeum]] (institute) for [[philosophy]] and research at [[Alexandria]] by [[Ptolemy I Soter]] about 280 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/ptolemy1.htm |title= Ptolemy I Soter, The First King of Ancient Egypt's Ptolemaic Dynasty|accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Tour Egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
[[File:Bode_Museum.jpg|thumb|The [[Museum Island]] in [[Berlin]].]]
The purpose of modern museums is to collect, preserve, interpret, and display items of artistic, cultural, or scientific significance for the education of the public. From a visitor or community perspective, the purpose can also depend on one's point of view. A trip to a local history museum or large city art museum can be an entertaining and enlightening way to spend the day. To city leaders, a healthy museum community can be seen as a gauge of the economic health of a city, and a way to increase the sophistication of its inhabitants. To a museum professional, a museum might be seen as a way to educate the public about the museum's mission, such as civil rights or environmentalism. Museums are, above all, storehouses of knowledge. In 1829, James Smithson's bequest, that would fund the [[Smithsonian Institution]], stated he wanted to establish an institution "for the increase and diffusion of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher = Smithsonian Institution|title = James Smithson Society| url = https://www.si.edu/giving/membership/james-smithson-society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Museums of natural history in the late 19th century exemplified the Victorian desire for consumption and for order.  Gathering all examples of each classification of a field of knowledge for research and for display was the purpose.  As American colleges grew in the 19th century, they developed their own natural history collections for the use of their students.  By the last quarter of the 19th century, the scientific research in the universities was shifting toward biological research on a cellular level, and cutting edge research moved from museums to university laboratories.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, "Museums and American Intellectual Life, 1876–1926", 1998, The University of Chicago Press, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;   While many large museums, such as the [[Smithsonian Institution]], are still respected as research centers, research is no longer a main purpose of most museums. While there is an ongoing debate about the purposes of interpretation of a museum's collection, there has been a consistent mission to protect and preserve artifacts for future generations.  Much care, expertise, and expense is invested in preservation efforts to retard decomposition in aging documents, artifacts, artworks, and buildings.  All museums display objects that are important to a culture.  As historian Steven Conn writes, "To see the thing itself, with one's own eyes and in a public place, surrounded by other people having some version of the same experience can be enchanting."&lt;ref&gt;Steven Conn, "Museums and American Intellectual Life, 1876–1926", 1998, The University of Chicago Press, 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Museum purposes vary from institution to institution. Some favor education over conservation, or vice versa. For example, in the 1970s, the [[Canada Science and Technology Museum]] favored education over preservation of their objects. They displayed objects as well as their functions. One exhibit featured a historic printing press that a staff member used for visitors to create museum memorabilia.&lt;ref&gt;Babian, Sharon, ''CSTM: A History of the Canada Science and Technology Museum'', pp. 42–45&lt;/ref&gt;  Some seek to reach a wide audience, such as a national or state museum, while some museums have specific audiences, like the LDS [[Church History Museum]] or local history organizations. Generally speaking, museums collect objects of significance that comply with their mission statement for conservation and display.
Although most museums do not allow physical contact with the associated artifacts, there are some that are interactive and encourage a more hands-on approach. In 2009, [[Hampton Court Palace]], palace of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], opened the council room to the general public to create an interactive environment for visitors. Rather than allowing visitors to handle 500-year-old objects, the museum created replicas, as well as replica costumes. The daily activities, historic clothing, and even temperature changes immerse the visitor in a slice of what Tudor life may have been.&lt;ref&gt;Lipschomb, Suzannah, "Historical Authenticity and Interpretive Strategy at Hampton Court Palace," ''The Public Historian'' 32, no.3, August 2010, pp. 98–119.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early museums===

Early museums began as the private collections of wealthy individuals, families or institutions of art and rare or curious natural objects and [[artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]]. These were often displayed in so-called wonder rooms or [[cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]]. One of the oldest museums known is [[Ennigaldi-Nanna's museum]], built by Princess Ennigaldi at the end of the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]]. The site dates from c. 530 BCE, and contained artifacts from earlier [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian civilizations]]. Notably, a clay drum label—written in three languages—was found at the site, referencing the history and discovery of a museum item.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/5805358/the-story-behind-the-worlds-oldest-museum-built-by-a-babylonian-princess-2500-years-ago|title=The story behind the world's oldest museum, built by a Babylonian princess 2,500 years ago|last=Wilkens|first=Alasdair|date=25 May 2011|website=io9|access-date=31 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Manssour|first=Y. M.|last2=El-Daly|first2=H. M.|last3=Morsi|first3=N. K.|date=|title=The Historical Evolution of Museums Architecture|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36076072/THE_HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_OF_MUSEUM_ARCHITECTURE.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1522521609&amp;Signature=Fj5imIz0inyCc8%2BT8U1dFwShxoQ%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DTHE_HISTORICAL_EVOLUTION_OF_MUSEUMS_ARCH.pdf|journal=N/A|volume=|pages=2|via=Academia.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public access to these museums was often possible for the "respectable", especially to private art collections, but at the whim of the owner and his staff. One way that elite men during this time period gained a higher social status in the world of elites was by becoming a collector of these curious objects and displaying them. Many of the items in these collections were new discoveries and these collectors or naturalists, since many of these people held interest in natural sciences, were eager to obtain them. By putting their collections in a museum and on display, they not only got to show their fantastic finds but they also used the museum as a way to sort and "manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced." &lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),3.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of these naturalists and collectors was [[Ulisse Aldrovandi]], whose collection policy of gathering as many objects and facts about them was "encyclopedic" in nature, reminiscent of that of Pliny, the Roman philosopher and naturalist.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),62.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was to consume and collect as much knowledge as possible, to put everything they collected and everything they knew in these displays. In time, however, museum philosophy would change and the encyclopedic nature of information that was so enjoyed by Aldrovandi and his cohorts would be dismissed as well as "the museums that contained this knowledge." The 18th-century scholars of the [[Age of Enlightenment]] saw their ideas of the museum as superior and based their natural history museums on "organization and taxonomy" rather than displaying everything in any order after the style of Aldrovandi.&lt;ref&gt;Paula Findlen, Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy (Berkeley, California: University of California Press, 1994),393–397.&lt;/ref&gt;

Verifiably called a ‘museum’ as early as c.1580.
* the [[Royal Armouries]] in the [[Tower of London]] is the oldest museum in the [[United Kingdom]].

The Uffizi Palace (built 1560-1581) was designed by the Renaissance painter and architect [[Giorgio Vasari]].

===Modern museums===

Modern museums first emerged in western Europe, then spread into other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Chang Wan-Chen, ''A cross-cultural perspective on musealization: the museum’s
reception by China and Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century'' in ''Museum and Society'', vol 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "public" museums were often accessible only by the middle and upper classes. It could be difficult to gain entrance. When the British Museum opened to the public in 1759, it was a concern that large crowds could damage the artifacts. Prospective visitors to the British Museum had to apply in writing for admission, and small groups were allowed into the galleries each day.&lt;ref&gt;The British Museum, " Admission Ticket to the British Museum" https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/archives/a/admission_ticket_to_the_britis.aspx, accessed 4/3/14.&lt;/ref&gt; The British Museum became increasingly popular during the 19th century, amongst all age groups and social classes who visited the British Museum, especially on public holidays.&lt;ref name="BM" /&gt;

The [[Ashmolean Museum]], however, founded in 1677 from the personal collection of [[Elias Ashmole]], was set up in the University of Oxford to be open to the public and is considered by some to be the first modern public museum.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, Marjorie (2001), Curiosities and Texts: The Culture of Collecting in Early Modern England, Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt; The collection included that of [[Elias Ashmole]] which he had collected himself, including objects he had acquired from the gardeners, travellers and collectors [[John Tradescant the elder]] and [[John Tradescant the Younger|his son of the same name]]. The collection included antique coins, books, engravings, geological specimens, and zoological specimens—one of which was the stuffed body of the last [[dodo]] ever seen in Europe; but by 1755 the stuffed dodo was so moth-eaten that it was destroyed, except for its head and one claw. The museum opened on 24 May 1683, with [[natural history|naturalist]] [[Robert Plot]] as the first keeper. The first building, which became known as the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford|Old Ashmolean]], is sometimes attributed to [[Christopher Wren|Sir Christopher Wren]] or [[Thomas Wood (architect)|Thomas Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;H. E. Salter and Mary D. Lobel (editors) [[Victoria County History]] [http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63866 ''A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 3'' 1954 Pages 47–49]&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, the first public museum was the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Louvre |url=http://www.louvre.fr/en/history-louvre |publisher=History of Louvre |accessdate=14 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024093225/http://www.louvre.fr/en/history-louvre |archivedate=24 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; opened in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], which enabled for the first time free access to the former French royal collections for people of all stations and status. The fabulous art treasures collected by the French monarchy over centuries were accessible to the public three days each "''décade''" (the 10-day unit which had replaced the week in the [[French Republican Calendar]]). The ''Conservatoire du muséum national des Arts'' (National Museum of Arts's Conservatory) was charged with organizing the Louvre as a national public museum and the centerpiece of a planned national museum system. As [[Napoleon|Napoléon I]] conquered the great cities of Europe, confiscating art objects as he went, the collections grew and the organizational task became more and more complicated. After Napoleon was defeated in 1815, many of the treasures he had amassed were gradually [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|returned to their owners]] (and many were not). His plan was never fully realized, but his concept of a museum as an agent of nationalistic fervor had a profound influence throughout Europe.

Chinese and Japanese visitors to Europe were fascinated by the museums they saw there, but had cultural difficulties in grasping their purpose and finding an equivalent Chinese or Japanese term for them. Chinese visitors in the early 19th century named these museums based on what they contained, so defined them as "bone amassing buildings" or "courtyards of treasures" or "painting pavilions" or "curio stores" or "halls of military feats" or "gardens of everything". Japan first encountered Western museum institutions when it participated in Europe’s World’s Fairs in the 1860s. The British Museum was described by one of their delegates as a 'hakubutsukan', a 'house of extensive things' – this would eventually became accepted as the equivalent word for 'museum' in Japan and China.&lt;ref&gt;Chang Wan-Chen, ''A cross-cultural perspective on musealization: the museum’s reception by China and Japan in the second half of the nineteenth century'' in ''Museum and Society'', vol. 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

American museums eventually joined European museums as the world's leading centers for the production of new knowledge in their fields of interest. A period of intense museum building, in both an intellectual and physical sense was realized in the late 19th and early 20th centuries (this is often called "The Museum Period" or "The Museum Age"). While many American museums, both natural history museums and art museums alike, were founded with the intention of focusing on the scientific discoveries and artistic developments in North America, many moved to emulate their European counterparts in certain ways (including the development of Classical collections from ancient [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Mesopotamia]], and [[ancient Rome|Rome]]). Drawing on [[Michel Foucault]]'s concept of liberal government, [[Tony Bennett (sociologist)|Tony Bennett]] has suggested the development of more modern 19th century museums was part of new strategies by Western governments to produce a citizenry that, rather than be directed by coercive or external forces, monitored and regulated its own conduct. To incorporate the masses in this strategy, the private space of museums that previously had been restricted and socially exclusive were made public.  As such, objects and artifacts, particularly those related to high culture, became instruments for these "new tasks of social management."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first =Tony |last =Bennett|title =The Birth of the Museum |location=New York|publisher = Routledge Press|date= 1995|pages = 6, 8, 24|isbn=0415053889}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[University|Universities]] became the primary centers for innovative research in the United States well before the start of the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Nevertheless, museums to this day contribute new knowledge to their fields and continue to build collections that are useful for both research and display.

The late twentieth century witnessed intense debate concerning the repatriation of religious, ethnic, and cultural artifacts housed in museum collections. In the United States, several Native American tribes and advocacy groups have lobbied extensively for the repatriation of sacred objects and the reburial of human remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gulliford|first=Andrew|date=1992|title=Curation and Repatriation of Sacred and Tribal Artifacts|url=|journal=The Public Historian |volume= 14| issue = 3 |page=25|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Congress passed the [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act]] (NAGPRA), which required federal agencies and federally funded institutions to repatriate Native American "cultural items" to culturally affiliate tribes and groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/archeology/tools/laws/nagpra.htm|title=The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Park Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, many European museum collections often contain objects and cultural artifacts acquired through imperialism and colonization. Some historians and scholars have criticized the British Museum for its possession of rare antiquities from Egypt, Greece, and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duthie|first=Emily|date=2011|title=The British Museum: An Imperial Museum in a Post-Imperial World|url=|journal=Public History Review|volume=18 |pages=12–25|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
[[File:Lightmatter vaticanmuseum.jpg|thumb|[[Vatican Museums]].]]

The roles associated with the management of a museum largely depend on the size of the institution, but every museum has a hierarchy of governance with a Board of Trustees serving at the top. The Director is next in command and works with the Board to establish and fulfill the museum's mission statement and to ensure that the museum is accountable to the public.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Museums, "The Accreditation Commission's Expectations Regarding Governance." [http://www.aam-us.org/aboutmuseums/standards/stbp.cfm p. 1.]&lt;/ref&gt;   Together, the Board and the Director establish a system of governance that is guided by policies that set standards for the institution. Documents that set these standards include an institutional or strategic plan, institutional code of ethics, bylaws, and collections policy. The [[American Alliance of Museums]] (AAM) has also formulated a series of standards and best practices that help guide the management of museums.
* [[Trustee|Board of Trustees]] – The board governs the museum and is responsible for ensuring the museum is financially and ethically sound. They set standards and policies for the museum. Board members are often involved in fundraising aspects of the museum and represent the institution.
* Director- The director is the face of the museum to the professional and public community. They communicate closely with the board to guide and govern the museum. They work with the staff to ensure the museum runs smoothly.

[[File:Perez Art Museum Miami.jpg|thumb|[[Pérez Art Museum Miami|Pérez Art Museum]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]].]]
According to museum professionals Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, "Administration of the organization requires skill in conflict management, interpersonal relations, budget management and monitoring, and staff supervision and evaluation. Managers must also set legal and ethical standards and maintain involvement in the museum profession."&lt;ref&gt;Hugh H. Genoways and Lynne M. Ireland, ''Museum Administration: An Introduction'', (Lanham: AltaMira, 2003), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various positions within the museum carry out the policies established by the Board and the Director. All museum employees should work together toward the museum's institutional goal. Here is a list of positions commonly found at museums:
* [[Curator]] – Curators are the intellectual drivers behind exhibits. They research the museum's collection and topic of focus, develop exhibition themes, and publish their research aimed at either a public or academic audience. Larger museums have curators in a variety of areas. For example, [[The Henry Ford]] has a Curator of Transportation, a Curator of Public Life, a Curator of Decorative Arts, etc.
* [[Collection Management Policy|Collections Management]] – Collections managers are primarily responsible for the hands-on care, movement, and storage of objects. They are responsible for the accessibility of collections and collections policy.
* [[Registrar (museum)|Registrar]] – Registrars are the primary record keepers of the collection. They insure that objects are properly accessioned, documented, insured, and, when appropriate, loaned. Ethical and legal issues related to the collection are dealt with by registrars. Along with collections managers, they uphold the museum's collections policy.
* Educator – Museum educators are responsible for educating museum audiences. Their duties can include designing tours and public programs for children and adults, teacher training, developing classroom and continuing education resources, community outreach, and volunteer management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing  Museum|last=Roberts|first=Lisa C.|publisher=Smithsonian Institution Press|year=1997|isbn=|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators not only work with the public, but also collaborate with other museum staff on exhibition and program development to ensure that exhibits are audience-friendly. 
* [[Exhibit Designer]] – Exhibit designers are in charge of the layout and physical installation of exhibits. They create a conceptual design and then bring it to fruition in the physical space.
* [[Conservator-restorer|Conservator]] – Conservators focus on object restoration. More than preserving the object in its present state, they seek to stabilize and repair artifacts to the condition of an earlier era.&lt;ref&gt;University of Rochester, [http://mag.rochester.edu/plugins/acrobat/teachers/MuseumCareers.pdf "Museum Job Descriptions".]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other positions commonly found at museums include: building operator, public programming staff, photographer, librarian, archivist, groundskeeper, volunteer coordinator, preparator, security staff, development officer, membership officer, business officer, gift shop manager, public relations staff, and graphic designer.

At smaller museums, staff members often fulfill multiple roles. Some of these positions are excluded entirely or may be carried out by a contractor when necessary.

==Museum planning==
[[File:Museu de Arte de Sao Paulo 1 Brasil.jpg|thumb|[[São Paulo Museum of Art]] in [[São Paulo]], [[Brazil]].]]
{{See also|Museum planning|Interpretive planning}}

The design of museums has evolved throughout history. However, museum planning involves planning the actual mission of the museum along with planning the space that the collection of the museum will be housed in. Intentional museum planning has its beginnings with the museum founder and librarian [[John Cotton Dana]]. Dana detailed the process of founding the Newark Museum in a series of books in the early 20th century so that other museum founders could plan their museums. Dana suggested that potential founders of museums should form a committee first, and reach out to the community for input as to what the museum should supply or do for the community.&lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The New Museum (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 25.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dana, museums should be planned according to community's needs:

"The new museum…does not build on an educational superstition. It examines its community's life first, and then straightway bends its energies to supplying some the material which that community needs, and to making that material's presence widely known, and to presenting it in such a way as to secure it for the maximum of use and the maximum efficiency of that use." &lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The New Museum (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

The way that museums are planned and designed vary according to what collections they house, but overall, they adhere to planning a space that is easily accessed by the public and easily displays the chosen artifacts. These elements of planning have their roots with John Cotton Dana, who was perturbed at the historical placement of museums outside of cities, and in areas that were not easily accessed by the public, in gloomy European style buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Dana, John Cotton. The Gloom of the Museum. (Woodstock, VT: The Elm Tree Press, 1917), 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Questions of accessibility continue to the present day. Many museums strive to make their buildings, programming, ideas, and collections more publicly accessible than in the past. Not every museum is participating in this trend, but that seems to be the trajectory of museums in the twenty-first century with its emphasis on inclusiveness. One pioneering way museums are attempting to make their collections more accessible is with open storage. Most of a museum's collection is typically locked away in a secure location to be preserved, but the result is most people never get to see the vast majority of collections. The Brooklyn Museum's Luce Center for American Art practices this open storage where the public can view items not on display, albeit with minimal interpretation. The practice of open storage is all part of an ongoing debate in the museum field of the role objects play and how accessible they should be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Turning Museums Inside-Out with Beautiful Visible Storage|url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/turning-museums-inside-out-with-beautiful-visible-storage|website = Atlas Obscura|date = 24 September 2014|access-date = 1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of modern museums, interpretive museums, as opposed to art museums, have missions reflecting curatorial guidance through the subject matter which now include content in the form of images, audio and visual effects, and interactive exhibits. Museum creation begins with a museum plan, created through a [[museum planning]] process. The process involves identifying the museum's vision and the resources, organization and experiences needed to realize this vision. A feasibility study, analysis of comparable facilities, and an [[Interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] are all developed as part of the museum planning process.

Some museum experiences have very few or no artifacts and do not necessarily call themselves museums, and their mission reflects this; the [[Griffith Observatory]] in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], being notable examples where there are few artifacts, but strong, memorable stories are told or information is interpreted. In contrast, the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] uses many artifacts in their memorable exhibitions.

===Financial uses of museums===
In recent years, some cities have turned to museums as an avenue for economic development or rejuvenation. This is particularly true in the case of postindustrial cities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Do Museums Still Need Objects?|last = Conn|first = Steven|publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Philadelphia|pages = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of museums fulfilling these economic roles exist around the world. For example, the spectacular ''Guggenheim Bilbao'' was built in Bilbao, Spain in a move by the Basque regional government to revitalize the dilapidated old port area of that city. The Basque government agreed to pay $100 million for the construction of the museum, a price tag that caused many Bilbaoans to protest against the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = A Gleaming New Guggenheim for Grimy Bilbao|last = Riding|first = Alan|date = 24 June 1997|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |page = C9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the gamble has appeared to pay off financially for the city, with over 1.1 million people visiting the museum in 2015. Key to this is the large demographic of foreign visitors to the museum, with 63% of the visitors residing outside of Spain and thus feeding foreign investment straight into Bilbao.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://prensa.guggenheim-bilbao.es/src/uploads/2016/01/NP_Balance-2015_ES.pdf|title = Guggenheim Bilbao Annual Report 2015|date = |access-date = 20 January 2016|website = Guggenheim Bilbao|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar project to that undertaken in Bilbao was also built on the disused shipyards of Belfast, Northern Ireland. ''Titanic Belfast'' was built for the same price as the ''Guggenheim Bilbao'' (and which was incidentally built by the same architect, Frank Gehry) in time for the 100th anniversary of the Belfast-built ship's maiden voyage in 2012. Initially expecting modest visitor numbers of 425,000 annually, first year visitor numbers reached over 800,000, with almost 60% coming from outside Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Northern Ireland Focus: Titanic Success Raises Hopes For Tourism|last = Smyth|first = Jamie|date = 16 June 2013|work = Financial Times|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, similar projects include the 81, 000 square foot ''Taubman Museum of Art'' in Roanoke, Virginia and ''The Broad Museum'' in Los Angeles.

Museums being used as a cultural economic driver by city and local governments has proven to be controversial among museum activists and local populations alike. Public protests have occurred in numerous cities which have tried to employ museums in this way. While most subside if a museum is successful, as happened in Bilbao, others continue especially if a museum struggles to attract visitors. The ''[[Taubman Museum of Art]]'' is an example of a museum which cost a lot (eventually $66 million) but attained little success, and continues to have a low endowment for its size.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Start-Up Success Isn't Enough to Found a Museum|last = Wallis|first = David|date = 20 March 2014|work = New York Times|access-date = |via = |page = F6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some museum activists also see this method of museum use as a deeply flawed model for such institutions. Steven Conn, one such museum proponent, believes that "to ask museums to solve our political and economic problems is to set them up for inevitable failure and to set us (the visitor) up for inevitable disappointment."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Museum funding===

Museums are facing funding shortages. Funding for museums comes from four major categories, and as of 2009 the breakdown for the United States is as follows: Government support (at all levels) 24.4%, private (charitable) giving 36.5%, earned income 27.6%, and investment income 11.5%.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, Ford W. [http://www.photos.state.gov/libraries/amgov/133183/english/P_You_Asked_How_Are_Museums_Supported_Financially.pdf “How Are Museums Supported Nationally in the U.S.?”] Embassy of the United States of America, 2012..  Accessed 26 March 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Government funding from the National Endowment for the Arts, the largest museum funder in the United States, decreased by 19.586 million between 2011 and 2015, adjusted for inflation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2011-NEA-Annual-Report.pdf “National Endowment for the Arts 2011 Annual Report.”] National Endowment for the Arts, 2012. .  Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/2015%20Annual%20Report.pdf “National Endowment for the Arts 2015 Annual Report.”] National Endowment for the Arts, 2016.. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; The average spent per visitor in an art museum in 2016 was $8 between admissions, store and restaurant, where the average expense per visitor was $55.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aamd.org/sites/default/files/document/Art%20Museums%20By%20the%20Numbers%202016.pdf Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD)], “Art Museums by the Numbers 2016.” AAMD.org,. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Corporations, which fall into the private giving category, can be a good source of funding to make up the funding gap. The amount corporations currently give to museums accounts for just 5% of total funding.&lt;ref&gt;Stubbs, Ryan and Henry Clapp. [http://www.giarts.org/article/public-funding-arts-2015-update “Public Funding for the Arts: 2015 Update.”] Grantmakers in the Arts, GIA Reader, vol. 26, no. 3, Fall 2015.. Accessed 26 February 2017.
&lt;/ref&gt; Corporate giving to the arts, however, was set to increase by 3.3% in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =Sponsorship Spending on the Arts to Grow 3.3 Percent in 2017|website = ESP Sponsorship Report|date = 13 February 2017|url = http://www.sponsorship.com/iegsr/2017/02/13/Sponsorship-Spending-On-The-Arts-To-Grow-3-3-Perce.aspx|publisher = ESP Properties, LLC.}}

==Exhibition design==
{{Main article|Exhibit design}}
[[File:Indonesia Museum Traditional Dress 01.jpg|thumb|Exhibit in [[Indonesia Museum]], [[Jakarta]], displaying the traditional costumes of [[Ethnic groups in Indonesia|Indonesian ethnic groups]], such as [[Balinese people|Balinese]] and East Java.]]

Most mid-size and large museums employ [[exhibit design]] staff for graphic and environmental design projects, including exhibitions. In addition to traditional 2-D and 3-D designers and architects, these staff departments may include audio-visual specialists, software designers, audience research and evaluation specialists, writers, editors, and preparators or art handlers. These staff specialists may also be charged with supervising contract design or production services. The exhibit design process builds on the [[Interpretive planning|interpretive plan]] for an exhibit, determining the most effective, engaging and appropriate methods of communicating a message or telling a story. The process will often mirror the architectural process or schedule, moving from conceptual plan, through schematic design, design development, contract document, fabrication, and installation. Museums of all sizes may also contract the outside services of exhibit fabrication businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Jafari|first2=Aliakbar|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|title=Keeping your audience: Presenting a visitor engagement scale|journal=Tourism Management|volume=42|pages=321–329|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.12.011|year=2014|url=https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/46406/4/Taheri_Jafari_O_Gorman_Pre_Print_Draft.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exhibition design has as multitude of strategies, theories, and methods but two that embody much of the theory and dialogue surrounding exhibition design are the metonymy technique and the use of authentic artifacts to provide the historical narrative. Metonymy, or "the substitution of the name of an attribute or adjunct for that of the thing meant,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Oxford Dictionaries|metonymy}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a technique used by many museums but few as heavily and as influentially as Holocaust museums.

The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington D.C., for example, employs this technique in its shoe exhibition. Simply a pile of decaying leather shoes piled against a bare, gray concrete wall the exhibit relies heavily on the emotional, sensory response the viewer will naturally through this use metonymic technique. This exhibition design intentionally signifies metonymically the nameless and victims themselves. This metaphysical link to the victims through the deteriorating and aged shoes stands as a surviving vestige of the individual victim. This technique, employed properly, can be a very powerful one as it plays off the real life experiences of the viewer while evoking the equally unique memory of the victim. Metonymy, however, Jennifer Hansen-Glucklich argues, is not without its own problems. Hansen-Glucklich explains, "...when victims' possessions are collected according to type and displayed en masse they stand metonymically for the victims themselves ... Such a use of metonymy contributes to the dehumanization of the victims as they are reduced to a heap of indistinguishable objects and their individuality subsumed by an aesthetic of anonymity and excess."&lt;ref name="Hansen-Glucklich, J. 2011"&gt;Hansen-Glucklich, J. (2011). Holocaust Memories: Visuality and the Sacred in Museums and Exhibits Doctoral dissertation, UMI Dissertation Publishing, Ann Arbor&lt;/ref&gt;

While a powerful technique, Hansen-Glucklick points out that when used ''en masse'' the metonym suffers as the memory and suffering of the individual is lost in the chorus of the whole. While at times juxtaposed, the alternative technique of the use of authentic objects is seen the same exhibit mentioned above. The use of authentic artifacts is employed by most, if not all, museums but the degree to which and the intention can vary greatly. The basic idea behind exhibiting authentic artifacts is to provide not only legitimacy to the exhibit's historical narrative but, at times, to help create the narrative as well. The theory behind this technique is to exhibit artifacts in a neutral manner to orchestrate and narrate the historic narrative through, ideally, the provenance of the artifacts themselves.

While albeit necessary to some degree in any museum repertoire, the use of authentic artifacts can not only be misleading but as equally problematic as the aforementioned metonymic technique. Hansen-Glucklick explains, "The danger of such a strategy lies in the fact that by claiming to offer the remnants of the past to the spectator, the museum creates the illusion of standing before a complete picture. The suggestion is that if enough details and fragments are collected and displayed, a coherent and total truth concerning the past will emerge, visible and comprehensible. The museum attempts, in other words, to archive the unachievable."&lt;ref name="Hansen-Glucklich, J. 2011"/&gt; While any exhibit benefits from the legitimacy given by authentic objects or artifacts, the temptation must be protected against in order to avoid relying solely on the artifacts themselves. A well designed exhibition should employ objects and artifacts as a foundation to the narrative but not as a crutch; a lesson any conscientious curator would be well to keep in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hogg|first=Gill|last2=Liao|first2=Min-Hsiu|last3=O'Gorman|first3=Kevin|title=Reading between the lines: Multidimensional translation in tourism consumption|journal=Tourism Management|volume=42|pages=157–164|doi=10.1016/j.tourman.2013.10.005|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some museum scholars have even begun to question whether museums truly need artifacts at all. Historian Steven Conn provocatively asks this question, suggesting that there are fewer objects in ''all'' museums now, as they have been progressively replaced by interactive technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As educational programming has grown in museums, mass collections of objects have receded in importance. This is not necessarily a negative development. Dorothy Canfield Fisher observed that the reduction in objects has pushed museums to grow from institutions that artlessly showcased their many artifacts (in the style of early cabinets of curiosity) to instead "thinning out" the objects presented "for a general view of any given subject or period, and to put the rest away in archive-storage-rooms, where they could be consulted by students, the only people who really needed to see them."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon of disappearing objects is especially present in science museums like the [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in Chicago, which have a high visitorship of school-aged children who may benefit more from hands-on interactive technology than reading a label beside an artifact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Types==
[[File:Museodeloro (1).jpg|thumb|[[Gold Museum, Bogotá|Gold Museum]], [[Bogotá]] [[Colombia]].]]

Types of museums vary, from large institutions, covering many of the categories below, to very small institutions focusing on a specific subject, location, or a notable person. Categories include: [[fine art]]s, [[applied arts]], [[craft]], [[archaeology]], [[anthropology]] and [[ethnology]], [[biography]], [[history]], [[cultural history]], [[science]], [[technology]], [[children's museum]]s, [[natural history]], [[botanical garden|botanical]] and [[zoo|zoological gardens]]. Within these categories, many museums specialize further, e.g. museums of [[modern art]], folk art, local history, [[military history]], [[aviation]] history, [[philately]], [[agriculture]], or [[geology]]. Another type of museum is an encyclopedic museum. Commonly referred to as a universal museum, encyclopedic museums have collections representative of the world and typically include art, science, history, and cultural history. The type and size of a museum is reflected in its collection. A museum normally houses a core collection of important selected objects in its field.

===Architectural museums===
Architectural museums are institutions dedicated to educating visitors about architecture and a variety of related fields, often including urban design, landscape design, interior decoration, engineering, and historic preservation.  Additionally, museums of art or history sometimes dedicate a portion of the museum or a permanent exhibit to a particular facet or era of architecture and design, though this does not technically constitute a proper museum of architecture.

The [[International Confederation of Architectural Museums]] (ICAM) is the principal worldwide organisation for architectural museums.  Members consist of almost all large institutions specializing in this field and also those offering permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries.

Architecture museums are in fact a less common type in the United States, due partly to the difficulty of curating a collection which could adequately represent or embody the large scale subject matter.

The National Building Museum in Washington D.C., a privately run institution created by a mandate of Congress in 1980, is the nation's most prominent public museum of architecture. In addition to its architectural exhibits and collections, the museum seeks to educate the public about engineering and design. The NBM is a unique museum in that the building in which it is housed—the historic Pension Building built 1882–87—is itself a sort of curated collection piece which teaches about architecture.  Another large scale museum of architecture is the Chicago Athenaeum, an international Museum of Architecture and Design, founded in 1988.  The Athenaeum differs from the National Building Museum not only in its global scope—it has offices in Italy, Greece, Germany, and Ireland—but also in its broader topical scope, which encompasses smaller modern appliances and graphic design.

A very different and much smaller example of an American architectural museum is the Schifferstadt Architectural Museum in Frederick, Maryland. Similar to the National Building Museum, the building of the Schifferstadt is a historic structure, built in 1758, and therefore also an embodiment of historic preservation and restoration.  In addition to instructing the public about its eighteenth century German-American style architecture, the Schifferstadt also interprets the broader contextual history of its origins, including topics such as the French and Indian War and the arrival of the region's earliest German American immigrants.

Museums of architecture are devoted primarily to disseminating knowledge about architecture, but there is considerable room for expanding into other related genres such as design, city planning, landscape, infrastructure, and even the traditional study of history or art, which can provide useful context for any architectural exhibit.

The American Society of Landscape Architects has professional awards given out every year to architectural museums and art displays. A few of the award-winning projects are:

===Archaeology museums===
Archaeology museums specialize in the display of archaeological artifacts. Many are in the open air, such as the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Agora of Athens]] and the [[Roman Forum]]. Others display artifacts found in archaeological sites inside buildings. Some, such as the [[Western Australian Museum]], exhibit maritime archaeological materials. These appear in its Shipwreck Galleries, a wing of the Maritime Museum. This Museum has also developed a  'museum-without-walls'  through a series of underwater wreck trails.

===Art museums===
{{Main article|Art museum}}
[[File:Uffizi Gallery - Michelangelo painting "Tondo Doni".JPG|thumb|right|Viewers of the ''[[Doni Tondo]]'' by [[Michelangelo]] in the [[Uffizi|Uffizi Gallery]].]]
An [[art museum]], also known as an art gallery, is a space for the exhibition of art, usually in the form of [[Work of art|art objects]]
from the [[visual arts]], primarily [[painting]]s, [[illustration]]s, and [[sculpture]]s. Collections of [[drawing]]s and [[old master print]]s are often not displayed on the walls, but kept in a [[print room]]. There may be collections of [[applied arts|applied art]], including [[ceramic art|ceramics]], [[metalworking|metalwork]], furniture, [[artist's book]]s, and other types of objects. [[Video art]] is often screened.

The first publicly owned museum in [[Europe]] was the Amerbach-Cabinet in [[Basel]], originally a private collection sold to the city in 1661 and public since 1671 (now [[Kunstmuseum Basel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Marta C.|last =  Lourenço|title = A Contribution to the History of University Museums and Collections in Europe|publisher = ICOM Conference 2002|url =  http://publicus.culture.hu-berlin.de/umac/2002/lourenco.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]] opened on 24 May 1683 as the world's first university art museum. Its first building was built in 1678–1683 to house the [[cabinet of curiosities]] [[Elias Ashmole]] gave [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]] in 1677. The [[Uffizi]] Gallery in [[Florence]] was initially conceived as offices for the Florentine civil service (hence the name), but evolved into a display place for many of the paintings and sculpture collected by the [[House of Medici|Medici]] family or commissioned by them. After the house of Medici was extinguished, the art treasures remained in Florence, forming one of the first modern museums. The gallery had been open to visitors by request since the sixteenth century, and in 1765 it was officially opened to the public. Another early public museum was the [[British Museum]] in London, which opened to the public in 1759.&lt;ref name="BM"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/the_museum/history/general_history.aspx |title=History of the British Museum |accessdate= |publisher=British Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a "universal museum" with very varied collections covering art, applied art, archaeology, anthropology, history, and science, and what is now the [[British Library]]. The science collections, library, paintings, and modern sculptures have since been found separate homes, leaving history, archaeology, non-European and pre-Renaissance art, and prints and drawings. Underwater museum is another type of [[art museum]] where the [[Artificial reef]] are placed to promote marine life. [[Cancun Underwater Museum]], or the Subaquatic Sculpture Museum, in [[Mexico]] is the largest underwater museum in the world. There are now about 500 images in the underwater museum. The last eleven images were added in September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://whatisusa.info/the-largest-underwater-museum-in-the-world/ |title=Largest underwater museum in the world |publisher=What is USA News |date=18 March 2014 |accessdate=16 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318092332/http://whatisusa.info/the-largest-underwater-museum-in-the-world/ |archivedate=18 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The specialised art museum is considered a fairly modern [[invention]], the first being the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] which was established in 1764.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

The [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]] was established in 1793, soon after the French Revolution when the royal treasures were declared for the people.&lt;ref name="McClellan"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of California Press|isbn = 0-520-22176-1|pages=&amp;nbsp;14–20|last = McClellan| first = Andrew| title = Inventing the Louvre: Art, Politics, and the Origins of the Modern Museum...|year =1999|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UUxG3N-t750C&amp;dq=inventing+the+louvre+luxembourg+gallery}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Czartoryski Museum]] in [[Kraków]] was established in 1796 by [[Izabela Czartoryska|Princess Izabela Czartoryska]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.czartoryski.org/museum.htm |title=History of The Czartoryski Museum  |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Czartoryski }}&lt;/ref&gt; This showed the beginnings of removing art collections from the private domain of aristocracy and the wealthy into the public sphere, where they were seen as sites for educating the masses in taste and cultural refinement.

===Biographical museums===
{{mainlist|:Category: Biographical museums}}
Biographical museums are dedicated to items relating to the life of a single person or group of people, and may also display the items collected by their subjects during their lifetimes.  Some biographical museums are located in a house or other site associated with the lives of their subjects (e.g. [[Sagamore Hill (house)|Sagamore Hill]] which contains the Theodore Roosevelt Museum or The [[Keats-Shelley Memorial House]] in the [[Piazza di Spagna]], [[Rome]]). Some homes of famous people house famous collections in the sphere of the owner's expertise or interests in addition to collections of their biographical material; one such example is The [[Wellington Museum]], [[Apsley House]], [[London]], home of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], which, in addition to biographical memorabilia of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke]]'s life, also houses his collection world-famous paintings.  Other biographical museums, such as many of the American [[Presidential library|presidential libraries]], are housed in specially constructed buildings.

===Automobile Museums===
There are one hundred and seven automobile museums in the United States, one in Canada, and one in the Republic of Georgia{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} according to the National Association of Automobile Museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naam.museum/museum-list/|title = Museum list|website = National Association of Automobile Museums}}&lt;/ref&gt; Automobile Museums are for car fans, collectors, enthusiasts, and for families. “They speak to the imagination,” says Ken Gross, a former museum director who now curates auto exhibits at the fine arts museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/travel/destinations/10greatplaces/2017/08/11/auto-museums/556458001/|title = 10 great auto museums worth a pit stop|work = USA Today|date = 11 August 2017|last = Bleiberg|first = Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As time goes by, more and more museums dedicated to classic cars of yesteryear are opening. Many of the old classics come to life once the original owners pass away. Some are not-for-profit while others are run as a private business.

===Children's museums===
[[File:Buell Childrens Museum by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[Buell Children's Museum]] in [[Pueblo, Colorado]] was ranked #2 children's art museum in the United States by ''Child Magazine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gocolorado.com/Article.aspx?articleId=a479ebf9-0fe2-4238-912c-cccfc231f5bc&amp;type=Article Go Colorado article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080621232812/http://www.gocolorado.com/Article.aspx?articleId=a479ebf9-0fe2-4238-912c-cccfc231f5bc&amp;type=Article |date=21 June 2008 }} that mentions that Buell Children's Museum was ranked second in the United States in 2002&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Children's museums are institutions that provide exhibits and programs to stimulate [[informal learning]] experiences for [[child]]ren. In contrast with traditional museums that typically have a hands-off policy regarding exhibits, children's museums feature interactive exhibits that are designed to be manipulated by children. The theory behind such exhibits is that activity can be as educational as instruction, especially in early childhood. Most children's museums are [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organizations, and many are run by [[Volunteering|volunteers]] or by very small professional staffs.&lt;ref name="ACM"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.childrensmuseums.org/ |title=The Association of Children's Museums website |publisher=Childrensmuseums.org |date= |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Brooklyn Children's Museum]] was established in 1899 by the [[Brooklyn Museum|Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences]]. It is often regarded as the first children's museum in the United States.&lt;ref name="Herminia Weihsin Din 1998"&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind the Brooklyn Children's Museum implicitly acknowledged that existing American museums were not designed with children in mind. Although museums at the turn of the century viewed themselves as institutions of public education, their exhibits were often not made accessible for children, who may have struggled with simple design features like the height of exhibit cases, or the language of interpretive labels.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa C. Roberts, ''From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing Museum'' (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997), 28–30.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, touching objects was often prohibited, limiting visitors' ability to interact with museum objects.

The founders of the Brooklyn Children's Museum were concerned with education and realized that no other institution had attempted to establish "a Museum that will be of especial value and interest to young people between the ages of six and twenty years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences|title =The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences|location=Brooklyn|date= 1900|page = 7|url = https://books.google.com/?id=4-hPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA7&amp;lpg=PA7&amp;dq=a+Museum+that+will+be+of+especial+value+and+interest+to+young+people+between+the+ages+of+six+and+twenty+years#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20Museum%20that%20will%20be%20of%20especial%20value%20and%20interest%20to%20young%20people%20between%20the%20ages%20of%20six%20and%20twenty%20years&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their goal was to gain children's interest and "to stimulate their powers of observation and reflection" as well as to "illustrate by collections of pictures, cartoons, charts, models, maps and so on, each of the important branches of knowledge which is taught in elementary schools."&lt;ref name="Herminia Weihsin Din 1998"/&gt;

Anna Billings Gallup, the museum's curator from 1904 to 1937, encouraged a learning technique that allowed children to "discover" information by themselves through touching and examining objects. Visitors to the museum were able to compare the composition, weight, and hardness of minerals, learn to use a microscope to examine natural objects, and build their own collections of natural objects to be displayed in a special room of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haven Schauffler, "The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Brooklyn, New York," ''The American Midland Naturalist'', 9 no. 5/6 (1924): 209–216.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to emphasis on allowing interaction with objects, Gallup also encouraged learning through play. She believed learning at the Brooklyn Children's Museum should be "pure fun", and to this end developed nature clubs, held field trips, brought live animals into the museum, and hired gallery instructors to lead children in classification games about animals, shells, and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Haven Schauffler, "The Children's Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, Brooklyn, New York," ''The American Midland Naturalist'', 9 no. 5/6 (1924): 208, 210, 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Other children's museums of the early twentieth century used similar techniques that emphasized learning through experience.

Children's museums often emphasize experiential learning through museum interactives, sometimes leading them to have very few or no physical collection items. The Brooklyn Children's Museum and other early children's museums grew out of the tradition of natural history museums, object-centered institutions. Over the course of the twentieth century, the children's museums slowly began to discard their objects in favor of more interactive exhibits. While children's museums are a more extreme case, it is important to note that during the twentieth century, more and more museums have elected to display fewer objects and offer more interpretation than museums of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Lisa C. Roberts, ''From Knowledge to Narrative: Educators and the Changing Museum'' (Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1997), 28–29.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars argue that objects, while once critical to the definition of a museum, are no longer considered vital to many institutions because they are no longer necessary to fulfill the roles we expect museums to serve as museums focus more on programs, education, and their visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Do Museums Still Need Objects?|last=Conn|first=Steven|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=Philadelphia|pages=21–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Brooklyn Children's Museum opened in 1899, other American museums followed suit by opening small children's sections of their institutions designed with children in mind and equipped with interactive activities, such as the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s children's room opened in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/smithsonian-childrens-room |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160302151744/http://siarchives.si.edu/blog/smithsonian-childrens-room |dead-url=no |archive-date=2 March 2016 |title=Knowledge Begins in Wonder: The Design Behind the Smithsonian Children's Room |last=Brady |first=Hillary |date=1 March 2016 |website=Smithsonian Institution Archives |publisher= |access-date=3 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Brooklyn Children's Museum also inspired other children's museums either housed separately or even developed completely independently of parent museums, like the [[Boston Children's Museum]] (1913), The Children's Museum of Detroit Public Schools (1915), and the [[The Children's Museum of Indianapolis|Children's Museum of Indianapolis]] (1925).&lt;ref&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 26–34.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of children's museums in the United States continued to grow over the course of the twentieth century, with over 40 museums opened by the 1960s and more than 70 children's museums opened to the public between 1990 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Herminia Weihsin Din, "A History of Children's Museums in the United States, 1899–1997: Implications for Art Education and Museum Education in the United States," (dissertation, Ohio State University, 1998), 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

International professional organizations of children's museums include the Association of Children's Museums (ACM), which was formed in 1962 as the American Association of Youth Museums (AAYM) and in 2007 counted 341 member institutions in 23 countries,&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; and The Hands On! Europe Association of Children's Museum (HO!E), established in 1994, with member institutions in 34 countries as of 2007.&lt;ref name="HO!E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hands-on-europe.net/ |title=Hands On! Europe website |publisher=Hands-on-europe.net |date= |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many museums that are members of ACM offer reciprocal memberships, allowing members of one museum to visit all the others for free.

===Design museums===

A [[design museum]] is a museum with a focus on [[Product (business)|product]], [[Industrial design|industrial]], [[Graphics|graphic]], [[fashion]], and [[Architecture|architectural]] design.
Many design museums were founded as museums for [[applied arts]] or [[decorative arts]] and started only in the late 20th century to collect [[design]].

===Diachronic versus synchronic===
It may sometimes be useful to distinguish between [[wikt:diachronic|diachronic]] and [[wikt:synchronic|synchronic]] museums.  According to [[University of Florida]]'s Professor Eric Kilgerman, "While a museum in which a particular narrative unfolds within its halls is diachronic, those museums that limit their space to a single experience are called synchronic."&lt;ref&gt;Kilgerman, Eric.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=r5TEsqmRfA8C&amp;pg=PA255 Sites of the Uncanny: Paul Celan, Specularity and the Visual Arts]'', p. 255 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Encyclopedic museums===
Encyclopedic museums are large, mostly national, institutions that offer visitors a plethora of information on a variety of subjects that tell both local and global stories. The aim of encyclopedic museums is to provide examples of each classification available for a field of knowledge.   "When 3% of the world's population, or nearly 200 million people, living outside the country of their birth, encyclopedic museums play an especially important role in the building of civil society. They encourage curiosity about the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Season Preview—The Promise of Encyclopedic Museums |url=http://www.elginism.com/similar-cases/lecture-on-the-encyclopaedic-museum/20080823/1283/ |date = 25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[James Cuno]], President and Director of the Art Institute of Chicago, along with Neil MacGregor, Director of the British Museum, are two of the most outspoken museum professionals who support encyclopedic museums. They state that encyclopedic museums are advantageous for society by exposing museum visitors to a wide variety of cultures, engendering a sense of a shared human history.&lt;ref&gt;James Cuno, "Museums Matter: In Praise of the Encyclopedic Museum", 2013, The University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some scholars and archaeologists, however, argue against encyclopedic museums because they remove cultural objects from their original cultural setting, losing their context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Malcolm|first=Bell III|title=Who's Right?

Ethnology museums are a type of museum that focus on studying, collecting, preserving and displaying artifacts and objects concerning [[ethnology]] and [[anthropology]]. This type of museum usually were built in countries possessing diverse [[ethnic group]]s or significant numbers of ethnic minorities.  An example is the [[Ozurgeti History Museum]], an ethnographic museum in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

===Historic house museums===
{{Main article|Historic house museum}}

Within the category of history museums, historic house museums are the most numerous. The earliest projects for preserving historic homes began in the 1850s under the direction of individuals concerned with the public good and the preservation of American history, especially centered on the first president. Since the establishment of America's first historic site at Washington's Revolutionary headquarters at Hasbrouck House in New York State, Americans have found a penchant for preserving similar historical structures. The establishment of historic house museums increased in popularity through the 1970s and 1980s as the Revolutionary bicentennial set off a wave of patriotism and alerted Americans to the destruction of their physical heritage. The tradition of restoring homes of the past and designating them as museums draws on the English custom of preserving ancient buildings and monuments. Initially homes were considered worthy of saving because of their associations with important individuals, usually of the elite classes, like former presidents, authors, or businessmen. Increasingly, Americans have fought to preserve structures characteristic of a more typical American past that represents the lives of everyday people including minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Butcher-Younghans|first=Sherry|title=Historic House Museums: A Practical Handbook for Their Care, Preservation, and Management|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|pages=i, 1, 5.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chambre de la Reine du Petit Trianon 004.jpg|thumb|left|The queen's chamber in [[Petit Trianon]], former residence of [[Marie Antoinette]].]] 
While historic house museums compose the largest section within the historic museum category, they usually operate with small staffs and on limited budgets. Many are run entirely by volunteers and often do not meet the professional standards established by the museum industry. An independent survey conducted by Peggy Coats in 1990 revealed that sixty-five percent of historic house museums did not have a full-time staff and 19 to 27 percent of historic homes employed only one full-time employee. Furthermore, the majority of these museums operated on less than $50,000 annually. The survey also revealed a significant disparity in the number of visitors between local house museums and national sites. While museums like Mount Vernon and Colonial Williamsburg were visited by over one million tourists a year, more than fifty percent of historic house museums received less than 5,000 visitors per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coats|first=Peggy|title=Survey of Historic House Museums|journal=History News|year=1990|volume=45|issue=1|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These museums are also unique in that the actual structure belongs to the museum collection as a historical object. While some historic home museums are fortunate to possess a collection containing many of the original furnishings once present in the home, many face the challenge of displaying a collection consistent with the historical structure. Some museums choose to collect pieces original to the period while not original to the house. Others, fill the home with replicas of the original pieces reconstructed with the help of historic records. Still other museums adopt a more aesthetic approach and use the homes to display the architecture and artistic objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hobbs|first=Stuart D.|title=Exhibiting Antimodernism: History, Memory, and the Aestheticized Past in Mid-twentieth century America|journal=The Public Historian|date=Summer 2001|volume=23|issue=3|pages=39|doi=10.1525/tph.2001.23.3.39}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Because historic homes have often existed through different generations and have been passed on from one family to another, volunteers and professionals also must decide which historical narrative to tell their visitors. Some museums grapple with this issue by displaying different eras in the home's history within different rooms or sections of the structure. Others choose one particular narrative, usually the one deemed most historically significant, and restore the home to that particular period.

===History museums===
[[File:Tutanchamon (js) 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The golden funerary mask of [[Tutankhamun]], [[Egyptian Museum]] of Cairo]]
[[:Category:History museums|History museums]] cover the knowledge of [[history]] and its relevance to the present and future. Some cover specialized curatorial aspects of history or a particular locality; others are more general. Such museums contain a wide range of objects, including documents, artifacts of all kinds, art, archaeological objects. [[:Category:Archaeological museums|Antiquities museums]] specialize in more archaeological findings.

A common type of history museum is a [[historic house]]. A historic house may be a building of special architectural interest, the birthplace or home of a famous person, or a house with an interesting history. Local and national governments often create museums to their history.  The United States has many national museums for historical topics, such as the National Museum of African American History and Culture.  [[Historic site]]s can also serve as museums, such as the museum at Ford's Theater in Washington D.C.  The U.S. National Park Service defines a historic site as the "location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing, ruined, or vanished, where the location itself possesses historic, cultural, or archeological value regardless of the value of any existing structure."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = National Register Bulletin: How to Complete the National Register Registration Form: Appendix IV: Glossary of National Register Terms|publisher =  U.S. Department of the Interior|website =  National Park Service|url =  http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb16a/nrb16a_appendix_IV.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Iron bed in Tuol Sleng prison.JPG|thumb|left|Iron bed in [[torture]] room at [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]]]]
Historic sites can also mark [[Public-order crime|public crimes]], such as [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum]] in Phnom Penh, Cambodia or Robben Island, South Africa.   Similar to museums focused on public crimes, museums attached to memorials of public crimes often contain a history component, as is the case at the Oklahoma City National Memorial &amp; Museum.  History museums may concern more general crimes and atrocities, such as American slavery.  Often these museums are connected to a particular example, such as the proposed International African American Museum in Charleston, South Carolina, which will treat slavery as an institution with a particular focus on slavery in Charleston and South Carolina's Lowcountry.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://iaamuseum.org/about/intro/|website = International African American Museum |title=Intro |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Museums in cities like Charleston, South Carolina must interact with a broader heritage tourism industry where the history of the majority population is traditionally privileged over the minority.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie E. Yuhl, A Golden Haze of Memory: The Making of Historic Charleston (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2005), 14–15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Fitzhugh Brundage, The Southern Past: A Clash of Race and Memory (Cambridge: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2005), 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many specialized museums have been established such as the [[National LGBT Museum]] in New York City and the National Women's History Museum planned for the National Mall. The majority of museums across the country that tell state and local history also follow this example.Other museums have a problem interpreting colonial histories, especially at Native American historic sites. However, museums such as the [[National Museum of the American Indian]] and Ziibiwing Center of Anishinabe Culture and Lifeways in Michigan are working to share authority with indigenous groups and decolonize museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Museums: Representing Native America in National and Tribal Museums|last=Lonetree|first=Amy|publisher=University of North Carolina|year=2012|isbn=|location=Chapel Hill|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of history museum is a living history museum. A living history museum is an outdoor museum featuring reenactors in period costume, and historic or reconstructed buildings. Colonial Williamsburg is a living history museum in Virginia that represents the colony on the eve of the American Revolution in the 18th century. The 301 acre historic area includes hundreds of buildings, in their original locations, but mostly reconstructed.&lt;ref&gt;Colonial Williamsburg, "That the Future May Learn From the Past", http://www.history.org/foundation/mission.cfm, accessed 4-3-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Living history museums===
[[File:Royalpalacektm2006.JPG|thumb|[[Narayanhity Palace|Narayanhity Palace Museum]] (formerly Narayanhiti Royal Palace) in [[Kathmandu]], [[Nepal]].]]
{{Main article|Living museum}}
Living history museums combine historic architecture, material culture, and costumed interpretation with natural and cultural landscapes to create an immersive learning environment. These museums include the collection, preservation or interpretation of material culture, traditional skills, and historical processes. Recreated historical settings simulating past time periods can offer the visitor a sense of traveling back in time. They are a type of open-air museum.

Two main interpretation styles dominate the visitor experience at living history museums: first and third person interpretation. In first person interpretation, interpreters assume the persona, including the speech patterns, behaviors, views, and dress of a historical figure from the museum's designated time period. In third person interpretation, the interpreters openly acknowledge themselves to be a contemporary of the museum visitor. The interpreter is not restricted by being in-character and can speak to the visitor about society from a modern-day perspective.

The beginnings of the living history museum can be traced back to 1873 with the opening of the [[Skansen]] Museum near Stockholm, Sweden. The museum's founder, [[Artur Hazelius]], began the museum by using his personal collection of buildings and other cultural materials of pre-industrial society.&lt;ref name="Living History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alhfam.org/?cat_id=153&amp;nav_tree=153 |title=Living History |publisher=The Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums |accessdate=20 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This museum began as an open-air museum and, by 1891, had several farm buildings in which visitors could see exhibits and where guides demonstrated crafts and tools.&lt;ref name="Leiterman 1983 14"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Leiterman |first=Eloise Lee |title=The Pros and Cons of "Living History" and some of the unpredictable hazards |journal=Christian Science Monitor |volume=1 |date=1 August 1983 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For years, living history museums were relatively nonexistent outside of [[Scandinavia]], though some military garrisons in North America used some living history techniques. Living history museums in the United States were initially established by entrepreneurs, such as [[John D. Rockefeller]] and [[Henry Ford]], and since then have proliferated within the museum world. Some of the earliest living history museums in the United States include [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (1926), [[Greenfield Village]] (1929), [[Conner Prairie]] Pioneer Settlement (1930s), [[Old Sturbridge Village]] (1946), and [[Plimoth Plantation]] (1947). Many living history farms and similar farm and agricultural museums have united under an association known as the Association for Living History, Farm, and Agricultural Museums (ALHFAM).&lt;ref name="Living History"/&gt;

===Maritime museums===
[[File:PolandSzczecinPanorama.JPG|thumb|[[National Museum, Szczecin|Maritime Museum]] in [[Szczecin]], [[Poland]].]]
{{Main article|Maritime museum}}
[[Maritime museum]]s are museums that specialize in the presentation of maritime history, culture, or archaeology. They explore the relationship between societies and certain bodies of water. Just as there is a wide variety of museum types, there are also many different types of maritime museums. First, as mentioned above, maritime museums can be primarily archaeological. These museums focus on the interpretation and preservation of shipwrecks and other artifacts recovered from a maritime setting. A second type is the maritime history museum, dedicated to educating the public about humanity's maritime past. Examples are the [[San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park]] and [[Mystic Seaport]]. Military-focused maritime museums are a third variety, of which the [[Intrepid Sea, Air &amp; Space Museum]] and [[USS Iowa Museum|Battleship IOWA Museum]] are examples.

===Medical museums===
{{See also|Medical History Museum (disambiguation){{!}}Medical History Museum}}
[[File:Museum of Medical Humanities.JPG|thumb|[[Museum of Medical Humanities]] in [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]].]]
Medical museums today are largely an extinct subtype of museum with a few notable exceptions, such as the [[Mütter Museum]] in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and the [[Hunterian Museum at the Royal College of Surgeons]] in Glasgow, Scotland. The origins of the medical museum date back to [[Renaissance]] [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosities]] which often featured displays of human skeletal material and other [[materia medica]]. Apothecaries and physicians collected specimens as a part of their professional activities and to increase their professional status among their peers.&lt;ref name="Findlen 1994 246"&gt;{{cite book|last=Findlen|first=Paula|title=Possessing Nature: Museums, Collecting, and Scientific Culture in Early Modern Italy|date=1994|publisher=Regents of the University of California|place=Berkeley and Los Angeles|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the medical profession placed greater emphasis on teaching and the practice of materia medica in the late 16th century, medical collections became a fundamental component of a medical student's education.&lt;ref name="Findlen 1994 246"/&gt; New developments in preserving soft tissue samples long term in spirits appeared in the 17th century, and by the mid-18th century physicians like [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] were using personal anatomical collections as teaching tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alberti|first=Sam|title=Medical Museums: Past, Present, and Future|journal=The Royal College of Surgeons of England Bulletin|volume=93|issue=2|date=2011|page=56|doi=10.1308/147363511x552548}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 19th century, many hospitals and medical colleges in Great Britain had built sizable teaching collections. In the United States, the nation's first hospital, the Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia, already had a collection of plaster casts and crayon drawings of the stages of pregnancy as early as 1762.&lt;ref name="McLeary 2000 599"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McLeary|first=Erin|title=The Mütter Museum: Preservation, Education, and Commemoration|journal=Annals of Internal Medicine|volume=132|issue=7|date=2000|page=599|doi=10.7326/0003-4819-132-7-200004040-00033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical museums functioned as an integral part of medical students education through the 19th century and into the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="McLeary 2000 599"/&gt; Dry and wet anatomical specimens, casts, drawings, oil paintings, and photographs provided a means for medical students to compare healthy anatomical specimens with abnormal, or diseased organs. Museums, like the Mütter, added medical instruments and equipment to their collections to preserve and teach the history of the medical profession. By the 1920s, medical museums had reached their nadir and began to wane in their importance as institutes of medical knowledge and training. Medical teaching shifted towards training medical students in hospitals and laboratories, and over the course of the 20th century most medical museums disappeared from the museum horizon. The few surviving medical museums, like the Mütter Museum, have managed to survive by broadening their mission of preserving and disseminating medical knowledge to include the general public, rather than exclusively catering to medical professionals.

===Memorial museums===
[[File:9-11 Memorial South Pool.jpg|thumb|[[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in [[New York City]].]]
Memorial museums are museums dedicated both to educating the public about and commemorating a specific historic event, usually involving mass suffering. The concept gained traction throughout the 20th century as a response to the numerous and well publicized mass atrocities committed during that century. The events commemorated by memorial museums tend to involve mostly civilian victims who died under "morally problematic circumstances" that cannot easily be interpreted as heroic. There are frequently unresolved issues concerning the identity, culpability, and punishment of the perpetrators of these killings and memorial museums often play an active research role aimed at benefiting both the victims and those prosecuting the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Memorial Museums: the Global Rush to Commemorate Atrocities|date=2007|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781845204891|pages=8; 20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today there are numerous prominent memorial museums including the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], the [[Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum|Toul Sleng Museum of Genocidal Crimes in Phnom Penh, Cambodia]], the [[District Six Museum]] in Cape Town, South Africa, and the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]] in [[New York City]]. Although the concept of a memorial museum is largely a product of the 20th century, there are museums of this type that focus on events from other periods, an example being the [[House of Slaves (Gorée)|House of Slaves (Maisons des Esclaves)]] in Senegal which was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1978 and acts as a museum and memorial to the Atlantic slave trade.

Memorial museums differ from traditional history museums in several key ways, most notably in their dual mission to incorporate both a moral framework for and contextual explanations of an event. While traditional history museums tend to be in neutral institutional settings, memorial museums are very often situated at the scene of the atrocity they seek to commemorate. Memorial museums also often have close connections with, and advocate for, a specific clientele who have a special relationship to the event or its victims, such as family members or survivors, and regularly hold politically significant special events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Paul|title=Memorial Museums: the Global Rush to Commemorate Atrocities|date=2007|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|isbn=9781845204891|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike many traditional history museums, memorial museums almost always have a distinct, overt political and moral message with direct ties to contemporary society. The following mission statement of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] is typical in its focus on commemoration, education and advocacy:

"The museum's primary mission is to advance and disseminate knowledge about this unprecedented tragedy; to preserve the memory of those who suffered; and to encourage its visitors to reflect upon the moral and spiritual questions raised by the events of the Holocaust as well as their own responsibilities as citizens of a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Statement USHMM |url=http://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/mission-statement |accessdate=29 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140519154448/http://www.ushmm.org/information/about-the-museum/mission-statement |archivedate=19 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military and war museums{{anchor|military museum}} &lt;!-- multiple articles direct to this anchor --&gt;===

{{Category see also|Military and war museums}}
Military museums specialize in military histories; they are often organized from a national point of view, where a museum in a particular country will have displays organized around conflicts in which that country has taken part. They typically include displays of [[weapon]]s and other military equipment, [[Military uniform|uniforms]], wartime [[propaganda]], and exhibits on civilian life during wartime, and [[Military orders, awards and decorations|decorations]], among others. A military museum may be dedicated to a particular or area, such as the [[Imperial War Museum Duxford]] for military [[aircraft]], [[German Tank Museum|Deutsches Panzermuseum]] for [[tank]]s, the [[Lange Max Museum]] for the [[Western Front (World War I)]], the [[International Spy Museum]] for espionage, [[Liberty Memorial#The National World War I Museum|The National World War I Museum]] for [[World War I]], the [[D-Day Paratroopers Historical Center]] (Normandy) for WWII airborne, or more generalist, such as the [[Canadian War Museum]] or the [[Musée de l'Armée]].

===Mobile museums===
'''Mobile museum''' is a term applied to museums that make exhibitions from a vehicle- such as a van. Some institutions, such as [[St. Vital Historical Society]] and the [[Walker Art Center]], use the term to refer to a portion of their collection that travels to sites away from the museum for educational purposes. Other mobile museums have no "home site", and use travel as their exclusive means of presentation. University of Louisiana in Lafayette has also created a mobile museum as part of the graduate program in History. The project is called [[Museum on the Move]].

{{mainlist|List of natural history museums}}
Museums of [[natural history]] and [[natural science]] typically exhibit work of the natural world. The focus lies on nature and culture. Exhibitions educate the public on natural history, dinosaurs, zoology, oceanography, anthropology, and more. Evolution, environmental issues, and biodiversity are major areas in natural science museums. Notable museums include the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]], the [[Oxford University Museum of Natural History]] in [[Oxford]], the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Muséum national d'histoire naturelle]] in [[Paris]], the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s [[National Museum of Natural History]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]], and the [[Canadian Museum of Nature]] in [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]].

===Open-air museums===

[[File:Farmhouse museum.JPG|thumb|An old [[farmhouse]] at the ''Salzburger Freilichtmuseum'' in Großgmain near [[Salzburg]].]]
[[Open-air museum]]s collect and re-erect old buildings at large outdoor sites, usually in settings of re-created landscapes of the past. The first one was [[Oscar II of Sweden|King Oscar II]]'s collection near [[Oslo]] in [[Norway]], opened in 1881. In 1907, it was incorporated into the [[Norwegian Museum of Cultural History|Norsk Folkemuseum]].&lt;ref&gt;Roede, Lars (1993). "The Open-air Museum Idea. An Early Contribution". ''Conference Report of the Association of European Open Air Museums 1991.'' Stockholm&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1891, inspired by a visit to the open-air museum in Oslo, [[Artur Hazelius]] founded the [[Skansen]] in [[Stockholm]], which became the model for subsequent open-air museums in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]], and eventually in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rentzhog, Sten (2007). ''Open air museums: The history and future of a visionary idea'', Carlssons Jamtli Förlag, Stockholm and Östersund. {{ISBN|978-9179482084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most open-air museums are located in regions where wooden architecture prevail, as wooden structures may be translocated without substantial loss of authenticity.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}} A more recent but related idea is realized in [[ecomuseum]]s, which originated in [[France]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

===Pop-up museums===
A concept developed in the 1990s, the pop-up museum is generally defined as a short term institution existing in a temporary space.&lt;ref name="museum 2.0"&gt;[http://museumtwo.blogspot.com/2011/11/radical-simple-formula-for-pop-up.html Simon, Nina K.], Museum 2.0 blog re: pop-up museums, their construction, and usefulness within the profession.&lt;/ref&gt; These temporary museums are finding increasing favor among more progressive museum professionals as a means of direct community involvement with objects and exhibition. Often, the pop-up concept relies solely on visitors to provide both the objects on display and the accompanying labels with the professionals or institution providing only the theme of the pop-up and the space in which to display the objects, an example of [[shared historical authority]]. Due to the flexibility of the pop-up museums and their rejection of traditional structure, even these latter provisions need not be supplied by an institution; in some cases the themes have been chosen collectively by a committee of interested participants while exhibitions designated as pop-ups have been mounted in places as varied as community centers and even a walk-in closet.&lt;ref name="MONA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.detroitmona.com/mona_pop-up_museum.htm|title=MONA: A Pop-Up Museum|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923213916/http://www.detroitmona.com/mona_pop-up_museum.htm|archivedate=23 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples of pop-up museums include:
* [[Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History]] (MAH), which currently hosts collaborative Pop Up Museums around Santa Cruz County.
* [[Museum of New Art]] (MONA) – founded in Detroit, Michigan in 1996 this contemporary art museum is generally acknowledged to be the pioneer of the concept of the pop-up museum.&lt;ref name="MONA" /&gt;
* [[The Pop-Up Museum of Queer History]] – a series of pop-up museum events held at various sites across the United States focusing on the history and stories of local LGBT communities.&lt;ref name="Queer Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.queermuseum.com/|deadurl=no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20180825185715/http://www.queermuseum.com/|archivedate = 25 August 2018|title = Pop-Up Museum of Queer History website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Denver Community Museum – a pop-up museum that existed for nine months during 2008–09, located in downtown Denver, Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denvercommunitymuseum.org/|title=Main : Denver Community Museum|publisher=|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Science museums===
{{mainlist|List of science museums}}
[[File:MSIChicago.JPG|thumb|left|[[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]].]]
[[Science museum]]s and technology centers or [[technology museum]]s revolve around scientific achievements, and marvels and their history. To explain complicated inventions, a combination of demonstrations, interactive programs and thought-provoking media are used. Some museums may have exhibits on topics such as [[computer]]s, [[aviation]], [[List of railway museums|railway museums]], [[physics]], [[astronomy]], and the [[animal|animal kingdom]]. The [[Museum of Science and Industry (Chicago)|Museum of Science and Industry]] in [[Chicago]] is a very popular museum.

Science museums traditionally emphasize cultural heritage through objects of intrinsic value, echoes of the 'curiosity cabinets' of the Renaissance period. These early museums of science represented a fascination with collecting which emerged in the fifteenth century from 'an attempt to manage the empirical explosion of materials that wider dissemination of ancient texts, increased travel, voyages of discovery, and more systematic forms of communication and exchange had produced.&lt;ref&gt;Findlen, P. (1994) Possessing nature: Museums, collecting, and scientific culture in early modern Italy. Los Angeles: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Science museums were institutions of authoritative, uncontestable, knowledge, places of 'collecting, seeing and knowing, places where "anybody" might come and survey the evidence of science.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"&gt;MacDonald, S. (Ed.) (1998) The politics of display: Museums, science, culture. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Dinosaurs, extensive invertebrate and vertebrate collections, plant taxonomies, and so on – these were the orders of the day. By the nineteenth century, science museums had flourished, and with it 'the capacity of exhibitionary representation to render the world as visible and ordered... part of the instantiation of wider senses of scientific and political certainty' (MacDonald, 1998: 11). By the twentieth century, museums of science had built 'on their earlier emphasis on public education to present themselves as experts in the mediation between the obscure world of science and that of the public.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"/&gt;
[[File:Diplodocus Minnesota Science Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Diplodocus fossil exhibit in [[Minnesota Science Museum]].]]
The nineteenth century also brought a proliferation of science museums with roots in technical and industrial heritage museums.&lt;ref name = rennie&gt;Rennie, L.J. &amp; McClafferty, T. (1996) Science centers and science learning. Studies in Science Education, 27, 53–98.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ordinarily, visitors individually interact with exhibits, by a combination of manipulating, reading, pushing, pulling, and generally using their senses. Information is carefully structured through engaging, interactive displays. Science centers include interactive exhibits that respond to the visitor's action and invite further response, as well as hands-on exhibits that do not offer feedback to the visitor,&lt;ref name = rennie/&gt; In general, science centers offer 'a decontextualized scattering of interactive exhibits, which can be thought of as exploring stations of ideas &lt;ref&gt;McManus, P. (1992) Topics in museums and science education. Studies in Science Education, 20, 157–182.&lt;/ref&gt; usually presented in small rooms or galleries, with scant attention paid to applications of science, social political contexts, or moral and ethical implications.

By the 1960s, these interactive science centers with their specialized hands-on galleries became prevalent. The [[Exploratorium]] in San Francisco, and the [[Ontario Science Centre]] in 1969, were two of the earliest examples of science centers dedicated to exploring scientific principles through hands-on exhibits. In the United States practically every major city has a science center with a total annual visitation of 115 million &lt;ref&gt;Koster, E.H. (1999) In search of relevance: Science centers as innovators in the evolution of museums. Daedalus, 28(3), 277–296.&lt;/ref&gt; New technologies of display and new interpretive experiments mark these interactive science centers, and the mantra 'public understanding of science' aptly describes their central activity.&lt;ref name="MACDONALD, S. 1998"/&gt;

Science museums, in particular, may consist of [[planetarium|planetaria]], or large theatre usually built around a dome. Museums may have [[IMAX]] feature films, which may provide [[3D film|3-D]] viewing or higher quality picture. As a result, IMAX content provides a more immersive experience for people of all ages.

Also new virtual museums, known as ''Net Museums'', have recently been created. These are usually websites belonging to real museums and containing photo galleries of items found in those real museums. This new presentation is very useful for people living far away who wish to see the contents of these museums.

===Specialized museums===
[[File:Cuckooland Museum clocks by Kirsty Davies.jpg|thumb|upright|Antique cuckoo clocks in the interior of [[Cuckooland Museum]].]]

A number of different museums exist to demonstrate a variety of topics. Music museums may celebrate the life and work of [[Lists of composers|composers]] or [[musician]]s, such as the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame|Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], or even the [[Rimsky-Korsakov Apartment and Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. Other music museums include live music recitals, such as the [[Handel House Museum]] in [[London]], [[England]].

In [[Glendale, Arizona]], the Bead Museum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beadmuseumaz.org/ |title=The Bead Museum |publisher=Beadmuseumaz.org |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  fosters an appreciation and understanding of the global, historical, cultural, and artistic significance of beads and related artifacts dating as far back as 15,000 years. Also residing in the American Southwest are living history towns such as [[Tombstone, Arizona]]. This historical town is home to a number of "living history" museums (such as the [[Gunfight at the O.K. Corral|O.K. Corral]] and the [[The Tombstone Epitaph|Tombstone Epitaph]]) in which visitors can learn about historical events from actors playing the parts of historical figures like [[Wyatt Earp]], [[Doc Holliday]], and [[John Clum]]. [[Colonial Williamsburg]] (in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]]), is another great example of a town devoted to preserving the story of America through reenactment.

[[File:AIG museum.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Creation Museum]] is a [[Christianity|Christian]] [[creationism]] museum run by [[Answers in Genesis]].]]
[[South Korea]] is host to the world's first museum devoted to the history and development of [[organic farming]], the [[Namyangju]] Organic Museum, with exhibit captions in both Korean and English, and which opened in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Paull, John (2011) [http://orgprints.org/20571/1/Paull2011JBDT.NamyangjuMuseum.pdf  "A Postcard from Korea: Worldʼs First Organic Agriculture Museum"], Journal of Bio-Dynamics Tasmania, 104:11–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[No Show Museum]], based in Zurich and Johannesburg, is the world's first museum dedicated to nothing and its various manifestations throughout the history of art.

Museums targeted for youth, such as [[children's museum]]s or [[toy museum]]s in many parts of the world, often exhibit interactive and educational material on a wide array of topics, for example, the [[Museum of Toys and Automata]] in Spain. The [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]] and the "Borusseum", the museum about [[Borussia Dortmund]] in [[Dortmund]], [[Germany]], are institutions of the sports category. The [[Corning Museum of Glass]] is devoted to the art, history, and science of [[glass]]. The [[National Museum of Crime &amp; Punishment]] explores the science of solving crimes. The Great American Dollhouse Museum in Danville, Kentucky, depicts American social history in miniature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedollhousemuseum.com |title=The Great American Dollhouse Museum |publisher=Thedollhousemuseum.com |date= |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interpretation centre]]s are modern museums or visitors centres that often use new means of communication with the public. In some cases, museums cover an extremely wide range of topics together, such as the [[Museum of World Treasures]] in Wichita, KS. In other instances, museums emphasize regional culture and natural history, such as the [[Regional Museum of the National University of San Martin]], Tarapoto, [[Peru]]. The [[Museum of Salt and Pepper Shakers]] shows the history and variety of an everyday item.

===Virtual museums===
A development, with the expansion of the [[World Wide Web|web]], is the establishment of [[virtual museum]]s and online exhibitions. Online initiatives like the [[Virtual Museum of Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.virtualmuseum.ca |title=Virtual Museum of Canada – Musée virtuel du Canada |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=virtualmuseum.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Museum of the United States Air Force]] provide physical museums with a web presence. Online [[curatorial platform]]s such as Rhizome&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rhizome.org |title=Rhizome |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=Rhizome }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Archive of Digital Art (ADA)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalartarchive.at/nc/home.html|title= ADA {{!}} Archive of Digital Art|website=www.digitalartarchive.at|language=en-EN|access-date=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed online exhibitions that transform the museal experience within the digital space.

Some virtual museums have no counterpart in the real world, such as LIMAC (Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Lima),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://li-mac.org/ |title=LiMAC – Museo de Arte Contemporáneo de Lima |accessdate=5 April 2008 |work=LiMAC }}&lt;/ref&gt; which has no physical location and might be confused with the city's own museum. The art historian [[Griselda Pollock]] elaborated a virtual [[feminism|feminist]] museum, spreading between classical art to contemporary art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encounters in the Virtual Feminist Museum |last=Pollock |first=Griselda |authorlink=Griselda Pollock |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Routledge |location= |isbn=0415413745 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some real life museums are also using the internet for virtual tours and exhibitions. In 2010, the [[Whitney Museum of American Art|Whitney Museum]] in New York organized what it called the first ever online Twitter museum tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whitney.org/Events/2010BiennialTwitterTour | title=Biennial Twitter Tour | publisher=[[Whitney Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zoological parks and botanic gardens===
[[File:SDZooSign.jpg|thumb|Zoos are considered "living museums". This is the entrance of the [[San Diego Zoo]] in [[San Diego]], [[California]].]]
{{Main article|Zoo}}
{{Main article|Botanical garden}}
Although zoos and botanical gardens are not often thought of as museums, they are in fact "living museums". They exist for the same purpose as other museums: to educate, inspire action, and to study, develop, and manage collections. They are also managed much like other museums and face the same challenges. Notable zoos include the [[San Diego Zoo]], the [[London Zoo]], [[Brookfield Zoo]] at Chicago, [[Berlin Zoological Garden]], the [[Bronx Zoo]] in New York City, [[Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden]], [[Jardin des Plantes]] in [[Paris]], and [[Zürich Zoologischer Garten]] in [[Switzerland]]. Notable botanic gardens include [[The New York Botanical Garden]], [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]], [[Chicago Botanic Garden]], [[Taipei Botanical Garden]], and [[Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario)]].

[[File:LocationAfricaEurasia.png|thumb|{{leftlegend|#23600F|Old World|outline=white}} ]]
[[File:Ptolemy World Map.jpg|thumb|Map of the "Old World" (the [[Ptolemy world map]] in a 15th-century copy)]]

The term "'''Old World'''" is used commonly in the West to refer to [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] ([[Afro-Eurasia]] or the World Island), regarded collectively as the part of the [[world]] known to its population before contact with the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] (the "[[New World]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old-world?show=2&amp;t=1417643287 |title=Old World |work=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the context of, and contrasts with, the [[New World]] (the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/new%20world |title=New world |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the context of [[archaeology]] and [[world history]], the term "Old World" includes those parts of the world which were in (indirect) cultural contact from the [[Bronze Age]] onwards, resulting in the parallel development of the early [[civilization]]s, mostly in the [[temperate]] zone between roughly the [[45th parallel north|45th]] and [[25th parallel north|25th]] parallels, in the area of the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iranian plateau|Persian plateau]], [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[History of China#Ancient China|China]].

These regions were connected via the [[Silk Road]] trade route, and they have a pronounced [[Iron Age]] period following the Bronze Age. In cultural terms, the Iron Age was accompanied by the so-called [[Axial Age]], referring to cultural, philosophical and religious developments eventually leading to the emergence of the historical [[Western world|Western]] ([[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]], "[[classics|classical]]"), Near Eastern ([[Zoroastrian]] and [[Abrahamic]]) and Far Eastern ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]]) cultural spheres.

==History==
The concept of the three [[continent]]s in the Old World, viz. [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]], goes back to [[classical antiquity]]. Their boundaries as defined by [[Ptolemy]] and other geographers of antiquity were drawn along the [[Nile]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] rivers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This definition remained influential throughout the Middle Ages (see [[T and O map]]) and the [[Early Modern period]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Other names==
The [[mainland]] of [[Afro-Eurasia]] (excluding [[island]]s such as the [[British Isles]], [[Japan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Malay Archipelago]]) has been referred to as the ''[[World Island]]''.  The term may have been coined by Sir [[Halford John Mackinder]] in ''[[The Geographical Pivot of History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Francis P. Sempa, [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_14/sempa_mac2.html "Mackinder's World."]  ''American Diplomacy'' (UNC.edu).  Retrieved 2018-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent of the Old World had names in some of its ancient cultures, including [[Midgard]] in Germanic cosmology, and [[Oikoumene]] among the Greeks.

'''Peace Cafés''' are [[peace]]-positive cafés in [[Canada]] that have declared an adherence to [[Manifesto 2000]], in addition to [[fair trade]], [[living wage]], and local [[organic foods]] standards while also utilizing their space for community gatherings on [[social justice]] and peace issues.  The designation is a registered [[trade mark]] of [[Canadian Centres for Teaching Peace]] (CCTP).

==Origin==
In 2006, CCTP founder Robert "Bob" Stewart drafted a prospectus for creating community-based centres for public peace education, called "Peace Cafés." Initiatives began in [[Hamilton, Ontario]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.activistmagazine.com/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=777&amp;Itemid=143 "Centre for Teaching Peace and Peace Café opens in Hamilton"], Activist Magazine 21 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Calgary, Alberta]] in 2007 to secure partnerships with existing cafés or to open completely new spaces. In December 2007, the Hamilton initiative secured a partnership with the downtown Sky Dragon Community Development Co-operative, with Robert Porter as local director. In 2008, Robert Porter extended the Peace Café family with a partnership in his rural hometown of [[Walkerton, Ontario]], with the White Rose Coffeehouse.

As of March 2009 there are groups in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]], [[Nelson, British Columbia]],&lt;ref name="selkirk0309"&gt;[http://selkirk.ca/about/news/name-15490-en.php Peace Café Advocates Change in Thinking], Selkirk College / Peace Café Nelson partnership announcement 09 march 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], and [[Calgary, Alberta]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/12926 "Cafe with peace on the menu opens soon"], University of Calgary Gauntlet 23 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt; working towards additional partnerships in their respective communities.

==Philosophy==
Peace Cafés are described as "safe community spaces dedicated to developing a [[Peace|Culture of Peace]] at the community level through dialogue, conversation, workshops, and a library of peace resources along with wholesome food and drink options."

[[Image:Mahmoud Ahmadinejad at Columbia 4 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Two men arguing politics outside Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s speech at [[Columbia University]] in 2007.]]A '''political argument''' is an instance of a [[logical argument]] applied to [[politics]]. Political arguments are used by [[academia|academics]], media [[pundit (politics)|pundits]], candidates for political office and government officials. Political arguments are also used by citizens in ordinary interactions to comment about and understand political events. More often than not, political arguments tend to be circular, repeating the same facts as premises under perhaps slightly different guises. Much political argument concerns issues of taxation and government spending.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Political argument should be distinguished from propaganda, in that propaganda has little or no structure or the rationale, if it exists, is egregiously [[fallacy|fallacious]].

A classic example of political arguments are those contained in ''[[The Federalist Papers]]'' arguing in favor of ratification of the [[American constitution]].

There are several ways of classifying political argument:

* Based on the purpose of the argument.
* Based on the logical structure of the argument.
* Based on the subject matter dealt with in the argument.

== Purpose of political argument ==

The purpose of argument is usually to sway belief. Political argument can occur in the context of political theory; for instance [[Machiavelli]]'s ''[[The Prince]]'' can be regarded as advice to rulers based on various kinds of arguments. Political argument though is not generally a purely intellectual activity, since it may also serve the strategic goal of promoting a political agenda.  One usually thinks of political argument as exclusive to democracies, but in fact some kinds of political argument may occur in undemocratic regimes as well, for example, to encourage greater sacrifice from the population, although it is more likely in such cases that [[propaganda]] will take the place of argument.  In a [[democracy]], though, political argument is particularly important, since there is a direct relation between the beliefs of citizens and the structure of power. Moreover, the institutions of a democracy in part define the relationships between beliefs and power.  In this case, political argument is an important element of [[political strategy]]. It is also possible that in a democracy, propaganda may also replace argument; indeed, much political advertisement has no discernible logical structure, and in our definition falls under propaganda.

This view of political argument in a democracy is closely related to the problem of [[social choice]]. Consider a social decision [[model (abstract)|model]] of the kind used in the [[theory of social choice]] (such as used in stating [[Arrow's theorem]]).  In this model society has a set of individuals ''X'' and it faces a set (political) alternatives ''A'' which need to be ranked in some way.  A ''ranking'' is a [[binary relation|relation]] ''R'' between the elements of ''A'' which is [[transitive relation|transitive]] and [[reflexive relation|reflexive]]. Note that two alternatives ''a'', ''b'' can satisfy ''a R b'' and ''b R a''. If this is the case, we say ''R'' is indifferent to ''a'', ''b''.  Each individual ''x'' in ''X'' will have an idiosyncratic ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; of the alternatives in ''A''. A ''profile'' is any function ''P'' that associate to each individual ''x'' a ranking of alternatives ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;; a profile is thus a function from ''X'' to rankings of ''A''. An arbitration scheme (or constitution or voting scheme) is a way of producing a ranking ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt; for the whole society from any profile ''P''. Thus an arbitration scheme is itself a function ''P'' → ''R''&lt;sub&gt;soc&lt;/sub&gt;.

Though any argument about politics is in a sense a political argument, an ''effective'' political argument is one that can actually change the social preference ranking. ''Effective'' political argument is a concept distinct from ''valid'' political argument.

=== Example ===
{{POV check|date=December 2008}}
Consider an idealized system of tax policy; tax is based on a tax cutoff point ''T'', that is individuals with income in excess of ''T'' pay taxes, everyone else pays no taxes.   In a simple majority rule social arbitration scheme, one might expect that a natural tax rate ''T'' can be determined: the [[median]] income (plus 1). However, a (possibly fallacious) political argument might attempt to change individual's ''voting by their pocket book'' by arguing that investment in capital and general welfare will increase by reducing taxes on higher income levels, that is raising the tax cutoff point.

A political argument may be ineffective but may still have a purpose, for instance as a justification for an unpopular political action, or as part of a historical narrative.

== Structure of political argument ==

Any argument claims to prove something. In the case of arguments used in politics, this something is an assertion about an element of the public sphere, such as economic policy, the environment, decisions about war and peace, abortion etc.   An argument cannot start from purely logical principles.  An argument is based on premises and some methods for reasoning from premises to conclusions.  The validity of an argument in politics can be evaluated in at least two ways: in purely semantic terms or in terms of adherence to certain rules of  argument (which  we can consider rules of fairness).

Semantically, one should note that some of the  premises used in an argument and the relationships between the assertions in the argument, are associated to specific models of economic or political processes. Other premises are moral assumptions: whether a particular action is good or desirable.  For example, arguments concerning  war against and must consider questions about specific threats that the adversary poses, the likelihood of success, the cost of war and so on. In practice, purely semantical evaluations of argument validity are extremely difficult to formulate in  a politically neutral way, since political positions usually involve commitment to some model of social and economic processes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6246">Most real databases contain data whose correctness is uncertain. In order to work with such data, there is a need to quantify the integrity of the data. This is achieved by using probabilistic databases.

A '''probabilistic database''' is an [[uncertain database]] in which the [[possible worlds]] have associated [[probability|probabilities]]. Probabilistic [[database management system]]s are currently an active area of research. "While there are currently no commercial probabilistic database systems, several research prototypes exist..."&lt;ref&gt;Vinod Muthusamy, Haifeng Liu, Hans-Arno Jacobsen: [http://www.eecg.toronto.edu/~jacobsen/ptopss.pdf Predictive Publish/Subscribe Matching.] University of Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Probabilistic databases distinguish between the [[logical data model]] and the physical representation of the data much like [[relational database]]s do in the [[ANSI-SPARC Architecture]].
In probabilistic databases this is even more crucial since such databases have to represent very large numbers of possible worlds, often exponential in the size of one world (a classical [[database]]), [[succinct data structure|succinctly]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Nilesh N. Dalvi]], [[Dan Suciu]]: Efficient query evaluation on probabilistic databases. VLDB J. 16(4): 523-544 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lyublena Antova]], [[Christoph Koch]], [[Dan Olteanu]]: 10^(10^6) Worlds and Beyond: Efficient Representation and Processing of Incomplete Information. ICDE 2007: 606-615&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==

In a probabilistic database, each data item←relation, tuple and value that an attribute can take—is associated with a probability ∈ (0,1], with 0 representing that the data is certainly incorrect, and 1 representing that it is certainly correct.

===Possible Worlds===

A probabilistic database could exist in multiple states. For example, if we are uncertain about the existence of a tuple in the database, then the database could be in two different states with respect to that tuple—the first state contains the tuple, while the second one does not. Similarly, if an attribute can take one of the values ''x'', ''y'' or ''z'', then the database can be in three different states with respect to that attribute.

Each of these ''states'' is called a possible world.

Consider the following database:

{| border=1 align=center
 |+ An Incomplete Database
 |-
 !A!!B
 |-
 |a1||b1
 |-
 |a2||b2
 |-
 |a3||{b3,b3′,b3′′}
 |-
 |}

&lt;small&gt;(Here ''{b3,b3′,b3′′}'' denotes that the attribute can take any of the values ''b3'',''b3′'' or ''b3′′'')&lt;/small&gt;

*Let us assume that we are uncertain about the first tuple, certain about the second tuple and uncertain about the value of attribute '''B''' in the third tuple.

Then the actual state of the database may or may not contain the first tuple (depending on whether it is correct or not). Similarly, the value of the attribute '''B''' may be ''b3'',''b3′'' or ''b3′′''.

Consequently, the possible worlds corresponding to the database are as follows:
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100" align=center
|+ World 1
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a1 ||align=center| b1
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 2
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a1 || align=center|b1
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 3
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a1 || align=center|b1
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′′
|}
{{Clear}}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 4
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 5
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′
|}
{| class="wikitable" style="float:left" width="100"
|+ World 6
|-
! A !! B
|-
| align=center|a2 || align=center|b2
|-
| align=center|a3 || align=center|b3′′
|}
{{Clear}}

===Types of Uncertainties===

There are essentially two kinds of uncertainties that could exist in a probabilistic database, as described in the table below:

{| border=1 align=center
|+ Types of Uncertainties
|-
! Tuple-level uncertainty !! Attribute-level uncertainty
|-
| Here, we are not sure if a tuple is correct or not, that is, whether it should exist in the database or not. || Here, we are not sure about the values that an attribute of a tuple can take, that is, it could take one of the several possible values. 
|-
| Corresponding to each uncertain tuple, there are two possible worlds: one which includes the tuple while the other which does not. || Corresponding to each uncertain attribute which can take one of the values ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', there are ''n'' possible worlds.
|-
| Tuple-level uncertainty can be seen as a boolean random variable associated with each uncertain tuple. || Attribute-level uncertainty can be seen as a random variable associated with each uncertain attribute which can take values ''a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,a&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''.
|}

By assigning values to random variables associated with the data items, we can represent different possible worlds.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12821">'''Pseudoskepticism''' (or '''pseudoscepticism''') is a philosophical or scientific position which appears to be that of [[skepticism]] or [[scientific skepticism]] but which in reality fails to be so.

==Nineteenth and early twentieth centuries==
An early use of the word was in self-denigration: on 31 August 1869, Swiss philosopher [[Henri-Frédéric Amiel]] wrote in his diary:
{{quote|My instinct is in harmony with the pessimism of Buddha and of [[Schopenhauer]]. It is a doubt which never leaves me, even in my moments of religious fervor. Nature is indeed for me a [[Maya (illusion)|Maïa]]; and I look at her, as it were, with the eyes of an artist. My intelligence remains skeptical. What, then, do I believe in? I do not know. And what is it I hope for? It would be difficult to say. Folly! I believe in goodness, and I hope that good will prevail. Deep within this ironical and disappointed being of mine there is a child hidden — a frank, sad, simple creature, who believes in the ideal, in love, in holiness, and all heavenly superstitions. A whole millennium of idyls sleeps in my heart; I am a pseudo-skeptic, a pseudo-scoffer.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Dudley Warner, Editor, ''Library Of The World's Best Literature Ancient And Modern, Vol. II'', 1896. Online at Project Gutenberg (e.g. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/12788/12788-8.txt here])&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It soon acquired its usual meaning where a claimed skeptic is accused of excessive sureness in turning initial doubts into certainties. In 1908 [[Henry Louis Mencken]] wrote on [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s criticism of philosopher [[David Strauss]] that:
{{quote|Strauss had been a preacher but had renounced the cloth and set up shop as a critic of Christianity. He had labored with good intentions, no doubt, but the net result of all his smug agnosticism was that his disciples were as self-satisfied, bigoted, and prejudiced in the garb of agnostics as they had been before as Christians. Nietzsche's eye saw this and in the first of his little pamphlets "David Strauss, der Bekenner und der Schriftsteller" ("David Strauss, the Confessor and the Writer"), he bore down on Strauss's bourgeoise pseudo-skepticism most savagely. This was 1873.&lt;ref&gt;H. L. (Henry Louis) Mencken, ''The Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche'' (1908) publ. T.F. Unwin. Reprinted in ''Friedrich Nietzsche'', Originally published: Boston : Luce and Co., 1913. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_r71AzHvf64C&amp;vid=ISBN1560006498&amp;dq=%22pseudo+skepticism%22&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;sig=GmCpU7uH_ZS-fJj_BF8vtbnaHrk&amp;q=%22pseudo+skepticism%22 p.30].&lt;/ref&gt;|sign=|source=}}

Professor of Philosophy at the University of Illinois, Frederick L. Will used the term "pseudo-skepticism" in 1942. [[Alasdair MacIntyre]] writes:
{{quote|[Frederick] Will was no exception. He began as an analytical philosopher, distinguishing different uses of language with the aim of showing that certain traditional philosophical problems need no longer trouble us, once we have understood how to make the relevant linguistic distinctions. The enemies were two: the philosophical skeptic who poses these false problems and the philosopher who thinks that the skeptic needs to be answered. So in "Is there a Problem of Induction?" (''Journal of Philosophy'', 1942) it is two senses of "know" that are to be distinguished: "All the uneasiness, the pseudo-skepticism and the pseudo-problem of induction, would never appear if it were possible to keep clear that 'know' in the statement that we do not know statements about the future is employed in a very special sense, not at all its ordinary one.&lt;ref&gt;Alasdair MacIntyre "[https://eastanglia.academia.edu/KennethRWestphal/Books/8825/F._L._Will_Pragmatism_and_Realism Foreword]" to the book ''Pragmatism and Realism'' by Frederick L. Will (1997) quoting his earlier paper "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2017379 Is There a Problem of Induction?]" ''Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 39, No. 19 (September 10, 1942), pp. 505-513&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] Professor of English, John E. Sitter used the term in 1977 in a discussion of [[Alexander Pope]]: "Pope's intent, I believe, is to chasten the reader's skepticism — the pseudo-skepticism of the overly confident 'you' ... "&lt;ref&gt;John E. Sitter, "[https://www.jstor.org/stable/450077 The Argument of Pope's Epistle to Cobham]" ''Studies in English Literature, 1500-1900'', Vol. 17, No. 3, Restoration and Eighteenth Century (Summer, 1977), pp. 435-449&lt;/ref&gt;

==Truzzi==
In 1987, [[Marcello Truzzi]] revived the term specifically for arguments which use scientific-sounding language to disparage or refute given beliefs, theories, or claims, but which in fact fail to follow the precepts of conventional [[skepticism|scientific skepticism]]. He argued that scientific skepticism is agnostic to new ideas, making no claims about them but waiting for them to satisfy a burden of proof before granting them validity. Pseudoskepticism, by contrast, involves "negative hypotheses"—theoretical assertions that some belief, theory, or claim is factually wrong—without satisfying the burden of proof that such negative theoretical assertions would require.&lt;ref name="truzzi1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Truzzi | first = Marcello | authorlink= Marcello Truzzi | url = http://www.anomalist.com/commentaries/pseudo.html | title = On Pseudo-Skepticism | year = 1987 | journal = Zetetic Scholar | issue = 12/13 | pages = 3–4| accessdate = 2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sandiego/access/289894041.html?dids=289894041:289894041&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+15,+2003&amp;author=&amp;pub=The+San+Diego+Union+-+Tribune&amp;desc=MARCELLO+TRUZZI+|+Helped+form+the+Committee+for+the+Scientific+Investigation+of+Claims+of+the+Paranormal;+67&amp;pqatl=google "Marcello Truzzi: Helped form the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal"], ''[[The San Diego Union Tribune]]'', February 15, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/2007-10-11/art-books/marla-vs-pollock-who-s-the-fraudiest/ "Marla vs. Pollock: Who’s the Fraudiest?"] ''[[LA Weekly]]'', October 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-2877850/The-plain-truth-about-legal.html "The plain truth about legal truth"] ''[[Harvard Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy]]'', January 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, while working as a professor of [[sociology]] at [[Eastern Michigan University]], Truzzi gave the following description of pseudoskeptics in the journal ''Zetetic Scholar'' (which he founded):
{{quotation|In science, the burden of proof falls upon the claimant; and the  more extraordinary a claim, the heavier is the burden of proof demanded. The true skeptic takes an agnostic position, one that says the claim is not proved rather than disproved. He asserts that the claimant has not borne the burden of  proof and that science must continue to build its [[cognitive map]] of reality without incorporating the extraordinary claim as a new "fact." Since the true skeptic does not assert a claim, he has no burden to prove anything. He just goes on using the established theories of "conventional science" as usual. But  if a critic asserts that there is evidence for disproof, that he has a negative hypothesis—saying, for instance, that a seeming [[Psi (parapsychology)|psi]] [[Experiment|result]] was actually due to an artifact—he is making a claim and therefore also has to bear a burden  of proof...

Both critics and proponents need to learn to think of [[adjudication]] in science as more like that found in the law courts, imperfect and with varying degrees of proof and evidence.  Absolute truth, like absolute justice,  is seldom obtainable. We can only do our best to approximate them.
|Marcello Truzzi|"On Pseudo-Skepticism", ''Zetetic Scholar'', 12/13, pp3-4, 1987&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;}}

Truzzi attributed the following characteristics to pseudoskeptics:&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;
#Denying, when only doubt has been established
#Double standards in the application of criticism
#The tendency to discredit rather than investigate
#Presenting insufficient evidence or proof
#Assuming criticism requires no burden of proof
#Making unsubstantiated counter-claims
#Counter-claims based on plausibility rather than empirical evidence
#Suggesting that unconvincing evidence provides grounds for completely dismissing a claim

He characterized true skepticism as:&lt;ref name="truzzi1"/&gt;
#Acceptance of doubt when neither assertion nor denial has been established
#No burden of proof to take an agnostic position
#Agreement that the corpus of established knowledge must be based on what is proved, but recognising its incompleteness
#Even-handedness in requirement for proofs, whatever their implication
#Accepting that a failure of a proof in itself proves nothing
#Continuing examination of the results of experiments even when flaws are found

[[Psychiatrist]] Richard Kluft noted that pseudoskepticism can inhibit research progress:
{{quote|".. today genuine skepticism of the benign sort that looks evenly in all directions and encourages the advancement of knowledge seems vanishingly rare. Instead, we find a prevalence of pseudo-skepticism consisting of harsh and invidious skepticism toward one's opponents' points of view and observations, and egregious self-congratulatory confirmatory bias toward one's own stances and findings misrepresented as the earnest and dispassionate pursuit of clinical, scholarly, and scientific truth."&lt;ref&gt;Kluft, Richard P., "Editorial: Building upon our foundations" (June 1994) in [https://scholarsbank.uoregon.edu/xmlui/handle/1794/1508 ''Dissociation'', Vol. 7, No. 2, p. 079-080], publ. Ridgeview Institute and the International Society for the Study of Dissociation&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Susan Blackmore]], who lost her initial belief in  [[parapsychology]] and in 1991 became a [[CSICOP]] fellow, later described what she termed the "worst kind of pseudoskepticism":
{{quote|There are some members of the skeptics’ groups who clearly believe they know the right answer prior to inquiry. They appear not to be interested in weighing alternatives, investigating strange claims, or trying out psychic experiences or altered states for themselves (heaven forbid!), but only in promoting their own particular belief structure and cohesion.&lt;ref&gt;JE Kennedy, "[http://jeksite.org/psi/jp03.pdf The Capricious, Actively Evasive, Unsustainable Nature of Psi: A Summary and Hypotheses]", ''The Journal of Parapsychology'', Volume 67, pp. 53–74, 2003. See Note 1 page 64 quoting Blackmore, S. J. (1994). Women skeptics. In L. Coly &amp; R. White (Eds.), ''Women and parapsychology'' (pp. 234–236). New York: Parapsychology Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Hugo Anthony Meynell]] from the Department of Religious Studies at the [[University of Calgary]], labels the "extreme position that all significant evidence supporting paranormal phenomena is a result of deception or lies" as pseudoskepticism.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Stoeber, Hugo Anthony Meynell, ''Critical Reflections on the Paranormal'', SUNY Press, 1996, {{ISBN|0-7914-3063-4}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-3063-7}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=c_A_wfFe-CoC&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq=Pseudo-skepticism&amp;sig=ACfU3U372C-YJbYhNmNzNYVOmlVA78cnmQ#PPA16,M1 page 16]&lt;/ref&gt;

While Truzzi's characterization was aimed at the holders of majority views who he considered were excessively impatient of minority opinions, the term has been used to describe advocates of minority intellectual positions who engage in pseudoskeptical behavior when they characterize themselves as "skeptics" despite [[cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] evidence that conforms to a preexisting belief. Thus according to Richard Cameron Wilson, some advocates of [[AIDS denial]] are indulging in "bogus scepticism" when they argue in this way.&lt;ref name=Wilson_NS&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/ideas/2008/09/evidence-sceptic-hiv-bogus Richard Wilson, "Against the Evidence"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 18 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson argues that the characteristic feature of false skepticism is that it "centres not on an impartial search for the truth, but on the defence of a preconceived ideological position".&lt;ref name=Wilson_fooled&gt;Richard C.

{{Wiktionary|rapport}}
'''Rapport''' is a close and harmonious relationship in which the people or groups concerned are “in sync” with each other, understand each other's feelings or ideas, and communicate smoothly.

The word stems from the old French verb ''rapporter'' which means literally to carry something back;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Manser |first1=Martin |last2=Turton |first2=Nigel |title=Advanced Learners Dictionary |publisher=Wordsworth Editions |year=1998 |isbn=1-85326-763-5 |page=574 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rapport |title= Rapport – Definition |publisher= Merriam Webster |accessdate= 22 Mar 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the sense of how people relate to each other means that what one person sends out the other sends back. For example, they may realize that they share similar values, beliefs, knowledge, or behaviors around politics, music or sports.&lt;ref name="KatzSweedler2010"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Neil H. Katz |author2=Marcia Koppelman Sweedler |author3=John W.

There are a number of techniques that are supposed to be beneficial in building rapport such as: matching your [[body language]] (i.e., [[Human position|posture]], [[gesture]], etc.);&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; indicating attentiveness through maintaining [[eye contact]];&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zhao |first1=Ran |last2=Papangelis |first2=Alexandros |last3=Cassell |first3=Justine |chapter=Towards a Dyadic Computational Model of Rapport Management for Human-Virtual Agent Interaction |chapter-url=http://www.articulab.justinecassell.com/publications/Zhao,%20Papangelis,%20Cassell%20IVA2014.pdf |title=Intelligent Virtual Agents |date=2014 |pages=514–527 |doi=10.1007/978-3-319-09767-1_62 |isbn=978-3-319-09767-1 |editor1-last=Bickmore |editor1-first=T. |editor2-last=Marsella |editor2-first=S. |editor3-last=Sidner |editor3-first=C. |series=Lecture Notes in Computer Science |volume=8637 |publisher=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and matching [[breath]]ing [[rhythm]] {{citation needed|date=April 2017}}. In conversation, some verbal behaviors associated with increased rapport are the use of positivity (or, positive "face management"), sharing personal information of gradually increasing intimacy (or, "[[self-disclosure]]"), and by referring to shared interests or experiences.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

Rapport has been shown to have benefits for psychotherapy and medicine,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Falkenström |first1=F |last2=Hatcher |first2=R |last3=Skjulsvik |first3=T |last4=Larsson |first4=M |last5=Holmqvist |first5=R |title=Development and Validation of a 6-item Working Alliance Psychotherapy |url=http://liu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:802104/FULLTEXT01.pdf |journal=Psychological Assessment |date=2014 |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=169–83 |doi=10.1037/pas0000038 |pmid=25346997}}&lt;/ref&gt; negotiation,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Drolet |first1=Aimee |last2=Morris |first2=Michael |title=Rapport in Conflict Resolution: Accounting for How Face-to-Face Contact Fosters Mutual Cooperation in Mixed-Motive Conflict |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/336e/291572583c58c0209c3dd7d374ee0927dcad.pdf |journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology |date=2000 |volume=36 |pages=25–30 |doi=10.1006/jesp.1999.1395}}&lt;/ref&gt; and education,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frisby |first1=Brandi |last2=Martin |first2=Matthew |title=Instructor–Student and Student–Student Rapport in the Classroom |journal=Communication Education |date=2010 |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=146 |doi=10.1080/03634520903564362}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others. In each of these cases, the rapport between members of a dyad (e.g. a teacher and student or doctor and patient) allows the participants to coordinate their actions and establish a mutually beneficial working relationship, or what is often called a “working alliance”.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Building ==
To achieve the benefits of interpersonal rapport in domains like education, medicine, or even sales, several methods have been shown to build rapport between people. These methods include coordination, showing your attentiveness to the other, building commonality, and managing the other's self-perception (also called "face" management).&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

=== Methods ===

==== Coordination ====
Coordination, also called "mirroring"&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; means getting into rhythm with another person, or coordinating one's verbal or nonverbal behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Building Rapport |last=Graham |first=Colly |url=http://www.evancarmichael.com/Sales/3151/Building-Rapport--Customer-Relationships.html |accessdate=2010-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Emotional mirroring''' – Empathizing with someone's emotional state by being on 'their side'. You must apply the skill of being a good listener in this situation so as you can listen for key words and problems that arise when speaking with the person. This is so you can talk about these issues and question them to better your understanding of what they are saying and show your empathy towards them (Arnold, E and Boggs, josh. 2007).
* '''Posture mirroring''' – Matching the tone of a person's body language not through direct imitation, as this can appear as mockery, but through mirroring the general message of their posture and energy.
* '''Tone and tempo mirroring''' – Matching the tone, tempo, inflection, and volume of a person's voice.

==== Mutual attentiveness ====
Another way of building rapport is by each partner indicating their attentiveness to the other.&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; This attentiveness may take the form of nonverbal attentiveness, such as looking at the other person,&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt; nodding at appropriate moments, or physical proximity, as seen in work on teachers' "immediacy" behaviors in the classroom.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; This attentiveness might also be demonstrated through reciprocation of nonverbal behaviors like smiling or nodding, similar to the coordination&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; or in the reciprocal sharing of personal details about the other person that signal one's knowledge and attentiveness to their needs.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

==== Commonality ====
Commonality is the technique of deliberately finding something in common with a person or a customer in order to build a sense of camaraderie and trust.
This is done through references to shared interests, dislikes, and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Establish trust and rapport |last=DeGroot |first=Bob |url=http://www.saleshelp.com/guestservices/destinations/newsletter/step7trustrapport.htm|accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; By sharing personal details or self-disclosing personal preferences or information, interlocutors can build commonality, and thus increase rapport.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

==== Face management ====
Another way of building rapport is through what is often referred to as "positive face management",&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spencer-Oatey|first1=Helen|title=(Im)Politeness, Face and Perceptions of Rapport: Unpackaging their Bases and Interrelationships|journal=Politeness Research|date=2005|volume=1|issue=1|pages=95–119|doi=10.1515/jplr.2005.1.1.95}}&lt;/ref&gt; but may also simply be called positivity. According to some psychologists,&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"/&gt; we have a need to be seen in a positive light, known as our "face". By managing each other's "face", boosting it when necessary, or reducing negative impacts to it, we are able to build rapport with others.&lt;ref name="Politeness Research"/&gt;

==Benefits==
There have been a number of proposed benefits from building interpersonal rapport, which all revolve around smoother interactions, improved collaboration, and improved interpersonal outcomes,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; though the specifics differ by the domain.

In the medical domain, doctor-patient rapport is often called the "Working Alliance", and is a measure of the collaboration quality between doctor (or therapist) and patient, often used as a predictor of therapy outcomes or patients' prescription adherence.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In education, teacher-student rapport is predictive of students' participation in the course, their course retention, likelihood to take a course in that domain again, and has sometimes been used to predict course outcomes.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Some have argued that teacher-student rapport is an essential element of what makes an effective teacher, or the ability to manage interpersonal relationships and build a positive, pro-social, atmosphere of trust and reduced anxiety.&lt;ref name="Teaching of Psychology"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rogers|first1=Daniel|title=Further Validation of the Learning Alliance Inventory: The Roles of Working Alliance, Rapport, and Immediacy in Student Learning|journal=Teaching of Psychology|date=2015|volume=42|issue=1|pages=19|doi=10.1177/0098628314562673}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student-student rapport, on the other hand, while largely out of the teacher's ability to control, is also predictive of reduced anxiety in the course, feelings of a supportive class culture, and improved participation in class discussions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

In negotiation, rapport is beneficial for reaching mutually beneficial outcomes,&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; as partners are more likely to trust each other and be willing to cooperate and reach a positive outcome. However, others have found that interpersonal rapport in negotiation can lead to unethical behavior, particularly in impasse situations, where the interpersonal rapport may influence the negotiators to behave unethically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jap|first1=Sandy|last2=Robertson|first2=Diana|last3=Hamilton|first3=Ryan|title=The Dark Side of Rapport: Agent Misbehavior Face-to-Face and Online|journal=Management Science|date=2011|volume=57|issue=9|pages=1610–1622|doi=10.1287/mnsc.1110.1359|ssrn=1789782}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying==
To better study how rapport can lead to the above benefits, researchers generally adopt one of three main approaches: self-report surveys given to the participants,&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; third-party observations from a naive observer,&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt; and some form of automated computational detection, using computer vision and machine learning.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

Self-report surveys typically consist of a set of questions given at the end of the interaction, asking the participants to reflect on their relationship with another person and rate various aspects of that relationship, typically on a Likert scale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Though this is the most common approach, it suffers from unreliability of self-report data, such as the issue of separating participants' reflection on a single interaction with their relationship with the other person more broadly.&lt;ref name="Teaching of Psychology"/&gt;

To address these issues, others have used a third-party observer to give a rating of the rapport to a particular segment of the interaction, often called a "slice".&lt;ref name="Psychological Inquiry"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt; Other recent work uses techniques from computer vision, machine learning, and artificial intelligence to computationally detect the level of rapport between members of a dyad.&lt;ref name="Intelligent Virtual Agents"/&gt;

The '''Richardson Institute for Peace Studies''' was the first [[Peace and conflict studies|peace &amp; conflict]] research centre in the UK and one of the first in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/research/research-centres/richardson-institute/ |title= Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion: Research Centres |accessdate=15 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is part of the Department of Politics, Philosophy, and Religion at [[Lancaster University]], where its members publish research, hold lectures and workshops, and run academic outreach programmes.

==History==
The Richardson Institute began as an independent organisation, the '''Lancaster Peace Research Centre''', in the [[North of England]] in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=EBzxsURb4-cC&amp;q=richardson+institute#v=snippet&amp;q=richardson%20institute&amp;f=false |work= Journal of Peace Research |title= Encyclopedia of Violence, Peace, and Conflict |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/51/2/145.full.pdf |work= Journal of Peace Research |title= Peace Research – Just the Study of War?|accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre was incorporated first into the Politics Department at Lancaster University, and then in 1969 into a branch of the Conflict Research Society at the [[University of Kent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://conflictresearchsociety.org/history/  |title= The Conflict Research Society: History |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/n1879/pdf/book.pdf?referer=1879  |title= War, Strategy, and History |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There the Centre was renamed the '''Richardson Institute for Conflict and Peace Research''' in honour of the polymath and pacifist [[Lewis Fry Richardson]], and was moved to 158 North Gower St, London, which it shared with the [[Women’s Research and Resources Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archiveshub.ac.uk/data/gb106-7pac  |title= Papers of Pat Caplan |accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time the Institute not only published academic papers, but also released an animated film about the nature of human communication in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://library.sl.nsw.gov.au/search~S2?/dAnimated+films./danimated+films/-3%2C-1%2C0%2CB/frameset&amp;FF=danimated+films+united+states&amp;7%2C%2C23 |work= State Library of New South Wales |title= Communicate or Else |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1978, with funding from the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]], the Institute returned to Lancaster University as an autonomous body of the Politics Department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bisa.ac.uk/files/BISA%20News/Autumn_1978_Issue_9.pdf |work= British International Studies Association Newsletter |title= Autumn 1978, No.9 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; There its activities diversified into undergraduate and postgraduate teaching, ultimately leading to the creation of a [[studentship]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alumni.lancs.ac.uk/document.doc?id=14 |work= Steps |title= Summer 2007 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its early [[Minor (academic)|minor course]] in conflict &amp; peace research proved particularly popular, and the Institute became renowned for lecturing in "unashamedly [[Behavioural sciences|behavioural]]" models of social science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bisa.ac.uk/files/BISA%20News/Spring_1980_Issue_13.pdf |work= British International Studies Association Newsletter |title= Spring 1980 |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990 the members of the Institute consolidated their work by publishing ''A Reader in Peace Studies'', a basic text that became set reading for many introductory peace studies courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gmu.edu/programs/icar/ijps/vol3_1/Harris.htm |title= A Portrait of University Peace Studies in North America and Western Europe at the End of the Millennium |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this new activity, the Institute was given the more general trade name of the '''Richardson Institute for Peace Studies'''.

As the Institute shared more of the Politics Department’s day-to-day teaching responsibilities, its other activities declined. With funding from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]], the Institute was re-launched in September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://results.ref.ac.uk/DownloadFile/EnvironmentTemplate/PDF?subId=1764 |work= Research Excellence Framework 2014 |title= Lancaster University: Theology and Religious Studies |accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 it began the Richardson Institute Internship Programme, a year-long, multidisciplinary research placement with such partners as the [[Institute for Strategic Dialogue]] and the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and in 2016 it opened a course in the [[Political theology|political theology of peace]] as the first in a number of [[distance learning]] modules on positive politics. The Institute also hosts an annual peace lecture series and runs a film club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/richinst/ |title= www.lancaster.ac.uk/fass/centres/richinst |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its present aim is to become an international partner of choice for universities and to improve the public understanding of peace. Since 2012 the Institute has published on such diverse topics as [[Indo-Pak relations]], sexuality in the [[Anglican Church]], and maritime [[Cyberwarfare|cyber operations]], and the [[ESRC]] has rated its research as outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/ppr/research/research-centres/richardson-institute/#publications |title= Richardson Institute Publications |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/en/clippings/richardson-institute-research-rated-as-outstanding-by-the-esrc(336a53aa-b8e1-4a7e-aae9-c063dedce4a0).html |work= Lancaster University Research Directory |title= Richardson Institute Research Rated as 'Outstanding' by the ESRC |accessdate=20 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lester R. Brown]], a prominent [[environmentalist]] and founder of the [[Worldwatch Institute]] and [[Earth Policy Institute]], describes sustainable living in the twenty-first century as "shifting to a renewable energy-based, reuse/recycle economy with a diversified transport system."&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Greg. [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown "An interview with Lester Brown"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161227004714/http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/lester-brown |date=27 December 2016 }} ''American Scientist''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Derrick Jensen]] ("the poet-philosopher of the [[ecological movement]]"), a celebrated American [[author]], [[radical environmentalist]] and prominent critic of [[Bright green environmentalism|mainstream environmentalism]] argues that "[[industrial civilization]] is not and can never be sustainable".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-22|title=Endgame (Derrick Jensen books)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Endgame_(Derrick_Jensen_books)&amp;oldid=786893218|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; From this statement, the natural conclusion is that sustainable living is at odds with industrialization. Thus, practitioners of the philosophy potentially face the challenge of living in an industrial society and adapting alternative norms, technologies, or practices.

Additionally, practical [[ecovillage]] builders like [[Living Villages]] maintain that the shift to alternative technologies will only be successful if the resultant built environment is attractive to a local [[culture]] and can be maintained and adapted as necessary over multiple generations.

Sustainable living is fundamentally the application of [[sustainability]] to lifestyle choice and decisions.  One conception of sustainable living expresses what it means in triple-bottom-line terms as meeting present ecological, societal, and economical needs without compromising these factors for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] [http://www.epa.gov/Sustainability "What is sustainability?"] Retrieved on: 20 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[United Nations General Assembly]] (2005).

Retrieved on: 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Another broader conception describes sustainable living in terms of four interconnected ''social'' domains: economics, ecology, politics and culture. In the first conception, sustainable living can be described as living within the innate carrying capacities defined by these factors. In the second or [[Circles of Sustainability]] conception, sustainable living can be described as negotiating the relationships of needs within limits across all the interconnected domains of social life, including consequences for future human generations and non-human [[species]].&lt;ref&gt;http://citiesprogramme.com/aboutus/our-approach/circles-of-sustainability&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sustainable design]] and [[sustainable development]] are critical factors to sustainable living. Sustainable design encompasses the development of [[appropriate technology]], which is a staple of sustainable living practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Fritsch |first= Al |author2=Paul Gallimore  |title = Healing Appalachia: Sustainable Living Through Appropriate Technology |publisher= University Press of Kentucky |year= 2007 |isbn= 0-8131-2431-X |page= 2}} Unknown retrieval date, revised: 25 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainable development in turn is the use of these technologies in infrastructure.  [[Sustainable architecture]] and [[sustainable agriculture|agriculture]] are the most common examples of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Wheeler |first= Stephen Maxwell |author2=Timothy Beatley  |title= The Sustainable Urban Development Reader |publisher= Routledge |year= 2004 |isbn= 0-415-31187-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
* '''1954''' The publication of ''Living the Good Life'' by [[Helen Nearing|Helen]] and [[Scott Nearing]] marked the beginning of the modern day sustainable living movement.  The publication paved the way for the "[[back-to-the-land movement]]" in the late 1960s and early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Nearing |first= Scott |author2=Helen Nearing  |title= Living the Good Life |year= 1953 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Nearing__Scott.html |title=Scott Nearing |author=Eroh, Ryan |publisher=Pabook.libraries.psu.edu |accessdate=21 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515194851/http://pabook.libraries.psu.edu/palitmap/bios/Nearing__Scott.html# |archive-date=15 May 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1962''' The publication of ''[[Silent Spring]]'' by [[Rachel Carson]] marked another major milestone for the sustainability movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rachelcarson.org |title=Rachel Carson's Biography |author=Lear, Linda |publisher=Rachelcarson.org |accessdate=21 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1972''' [[Donella Meadows]] wrote the international bestseller ''[[The Limits to Growth]]'', which reported on a study of long-term global trends in [[population]], [[economics]] and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It sold millions of copies and was translated into 28 languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainer.org/meadows/index.html SI: Donella Meadows Bio] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514003548/http://www.sustainer.org/meadows/index.html |date=14 May 2008 }} Sustainability Institute 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1973''' [[E. F. Schumacher]] published a collection of essays on shifting towards sustainable living through the appropriate use of technology in his book ''[[Small is Beautiful]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schumacher.org.uk/efschum_bibliography.htm E.F. Schumacher Bibliography] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010720165322/http://www.schumacher.org.uk/efschum_bibliography.htm |date=20 July 2001 }} Schumacher UK.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1992–2002''' The [[United Nations]] held a series of conferences, which focused on increasing sustainability within societies to conserve the Earth's natural resources. The [[Earth Summit]] conferences were held in 1992, [[Conference on the Human Environment|1972]] and [[Earth Summit 2002|2002]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/natlinfo/nsds/nsds.htm National Sustainable Development Strategies] United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''2007''' the [[United Nations]] published ''Sustainable Consumption and Production, Promoting Climate-Friendly Household Consumption Patterns'', which promoted sustainable lifestyles in communities and homes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/publications/household_consumption.pdf Sustainable Consumption and Production: Promoting Climate-Friendly Household Consumption Patterns] United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs 30 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shelter==
[[Image:PA120016.JPG|thumb|right|240px|An example of ecological housing]]
On a global scale, shelter is associated with about 25% of the [[greenhouse gas]] emissions embodied in household purchases and 26% of households' [[land use]].&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Environmental Impact Assessment of Household Consumption|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jiec.12371/abstract|journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1530-9290|pages = 526–536|doi = 10.1111/jiec.12371|language = en|first = Diana|last = Ivanova|first2 = Konstantin|last2 = Stadler|first3 = Kjartan|last3 = Steen-Olsen|first4 = Richard|last4 = Wood|first5 = Gibran|last5 = Vita|first6 = Arnold|last6 = Tukker|first7 = Edgar G.|last7 = Hertwich|volume=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Green building|Sustainable homes]] are built using sustainable methods, materials, and facilitate green practices, enabling a more sustainable lifestyle. Their construction and maintenance have neutral impacts on the Earth. Often, if necessary, they are close in proximity to essential services such as grocery stores, schools, daycares, work, or public transit making it possible to commit to sustainable transportation choices.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. ''Green Living for Dummies.'' Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes, they are [[off-the-grid]] homes that do not require any public energy, water, or sewer service.

If not off-the-grid, sustainable homes may be linked to a grid supplied by a power plant that is using sustainable power sources, buying power as is normal convention. Additionally, sustainable homes may be connected to a grid, but generate their own electricity through renewable means and sell any excess to a utility. There are two common methods to approaching this option: net metering and double metering.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment.'' Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Net metering uses the common meter that is installed in most homes, running forward when power is used from the grid, and running backward when power is put into the grid (which allows them to “net“ out their total energy use, putting excess energy into the grid when not needed, and using energy from the grid during peak hours, when you may not be able to produce enough immediately). Power companies can quickly purchase the power that is put back into the grid, as it is being produced. Double metering involves installing two meters: one measuring electricity consumed, the other measuring electricity created. Additionally, or in place of selling their renewable energy, sustainable home owners may choose to bank their excess energy by using it to charge batteries. This gives them the option to use the power later during less favorable power-generating times (i.e.: night-time, when there has been no wind, etc.), and to be completely independent of the [[electrical grid]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. ''The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment''. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sustainably designed (see [[Sustainable Design]]) houses &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/greenbuilding/2010/05/18/what-is-a-sustainable-home-a-truly-green-home/|title=What is a Sustainable Home? A Truly Green Home?|date=17 May 2010|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are generally sited so as to create as little of a negative impact on the surrounding [[ecosystem]] as possible, oriented to the sun so that it creates the best possible [[microclimate]] (typically, the long axis of the house or building should be oriented east-west), and provide natural shading or wind barriers where and when needed, among many other considerations. The design of a sustainable shelter affords the options it has later (i.e.: using [[Passive solar building design|passive solar lighting and heating]], creating temperature buffer zones by adding porches, deep overhangs to help create favorable microclimates, etc.)&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. ''The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century.'' London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sustainably constructed houses involve environmentally friendly management of waste building materials such as recycling and composting, use non-toxic and renewable, recycled, reclaimed, or low-impact production materials that have been created and treated in a sustainable fashion (such as using organic or water-based finishes), use as much locally available materials and tools as possible so as to reduce the need for transportation, and use low-impact production methods (methods that minimize effects on the environment).&lt;ref&gt;Snell, Clarke, and Tim Callahan.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many materials can be considered a “green” material until its background is revealed. Any material that has used toxic or carcinogenic chemicals in its treatment or manufacturing (such as [[formaldehyde]] in glues used in woodworking), has traveled extensively from its source or manufacturer, or has been cultivated or harvested in an unsustainable manner might not be considered green. In order for any material to be considered green, it must be resource efficient, not compromise [[indoor air quality]] or [[water conservation]], and be energy efficient (both in processing and when in use in the shelter).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Resource efficiency can be achieved by using as much recycled content, reusable or recyclable content, materials that employ recycled or recyclable packaging, locally available material, salvaged or remanufactured material, material that employs resource efficient manufacturing, and long-lasting material as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/greenbuilding/Materials/ Green Building Materials: Sustainable Building.] CalRecycle. Web. 23 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainable building materials===
Some building materials might be considered "sustainable" by some definitions and under some conditions.  For example,  wood might be thought of as sustainable if it is grown using [[sustainable forest management]], processed using [[sustainable energy]].  delivered by [[sustainable transport]], etc.:  Under different conditions, however, it might not be considered as sustainable.  The following materials might be considered as sustainable under certain conditions, based on a [[Life-cycle assessment]].

[[Building insulation|Insulation]] of a sustainable home is important because of the energy it conserves throughout the life of the home. Well insulated walls and lofts using green materials are a must as it reduces or, in combination with a house that is well designed, eliminates the need for heating and cooling altogether. Installation of insulation varies according to the type of insulation being used. Typically, lofts are insulated by strips of insulating material laid between rafters. Walls with cavities are done in much the same manner. For walls that do not have cavities behind them, solid-wall insulation may be necessary which can decrease internal space and can be expensive to install.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; Energy-efficient windows are another important factor in insulation. Simply assuring that windows (and doors) are well sealed greatly reduces energy loss in a home.&lt;ref name="McDilda, Diane Gow 2007"/&gt;  Double or Triple glazed windows are the typical method to insulating windows, trapping gas or creating a vacuum between two or three panes of glass allowing heat to be trapped inside or out.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; [[Low-emissivity]] or Low-E glass is another option for window insulation. It is a coating on windowpanes of a thin, transparent layer of metal oxide and works by reflecting heat back to its source, keeping the interior warm during the winter and cool during the summer. Simply hanging heavy-backed curtains in front of windows may also help their insulation.&lt;ref name="Hamilton, Andy 2009"/&gt; “Superwindows,” mentioned in [[Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution]], became available in the 1980s and use a combination of many available technologies, including two to three transparent low-e coatings, multiple panes of glass, and a heavy gas filling. Although more expensive, they are said to be able to insulate four and a half times better than a typical double-glazed windows.&lt;ref&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory B. Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the next Industrial Revolution.'' Boston: Little, Brown and, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Equipping roofs with highly reflective material (such as aluminum) increases a roof's [[albedo]] and will help reduce the amount of heat it absorbs, hence, the amount of energy needed to cool the building it is on. [[Green roofs]] or “living roofs” are a popular choice for thermally insulating a building. They are also popular for their ability to catch storm-water runoff and, when in the broader picture of a community, reduce the heat island effect (see [[urban heat island]]) thereby reducing energy costs of the entire area. It is arguable that they are able to replace the physical “footprint” that the building creates, helping reduce the adverse environmental impacts of the building‘s presence.&lt;ref&gt;Cutlip, Jamie.

Energy efficiency and water conservation are also major considerations in sustainable housing. If using appliances, computers, [[HVAC]] systems, electronics, or lighting the sustainable-minded often look for an [[Energy Star]] label, which is government-backed and holds stricter regulations in energy and water efficiency than is required by law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?c=products.pr_how_earn How a Product Earns the ENERGY STAR Label : ENERGY STAR."] ENERGY STAR.

Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a sustainable shelter should be able to completely run the appliances it uses using renewable energy and should strive to have a neutral impact on the Earth’s water sources&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monolake.org/about/waterconservation Water Conservation]. Mono Lake Committee. Web. 27 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]], including water from washing machines, sinks, showers, and baths may be reused in landscape irrigation and toilets as a method of water conservation. Likewise, [[rainwater harvesting]] from storm-water runoff is also a sustainable method to conserve water use in a sustainable shelter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/natres/06702.html Graywater Reuse and Rainwater Harvesting].

As mentioned under Shelter, some sustainable households may choose to produce their own renewable energy, while others may choose to purchase it through the grid from a power company that harnesses sustainable sources (also mentioned previously are the methods of metering the production and consumption of electricity in a household). Purchasing sustainable energy, however, may simply not be possible in some locations due to its limited availability. 6 out of the 50 states in the US do not offer green energy, for example. For those that do, its consumers typically buy a fixed amount or a percentage of their monthly consumption from a company of their choice and the bought green energy is fed into the entire national grid. Technically, in this case, the green energy is not being fed directly to the household that buys it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/home-garden/news/2007/07/buy-green-power-and-electricity-to-help-the-environment/overview/0707_buying_green_power_ov.htm Buy Green Power and Electricity to Help the Environment]. Consumer Reports: Expert Product Reviews and Product Ratings from Our Test Labs. Consumers Union of U.S., July 2007. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, it is possible that the amount of green electricity that the buying household receives is a small fraction of their total incoming electricity. This may or may not depend on the amount being purchased. The purpose of buying green electricity is to support their utility’s effort in producing sustainable energy.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Hamilton, Andy, and Dave Hamilton. The Self-sufficient-ish Bible: an Eco-living Guide for the 21st Century. London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Producing sustainable energy on an individual household or community basis is much more flexible, but can still be limited in the richness of the sources that the location may afford (some locations may not be rich in renewable energy sources while others may have an abundance of it).

When generating renewable energy and feeding it back into the grid (in participating countries such as the US and Germany), producing households are typically paid at least the full standard electricity rate by their utility and are also given separate renewable energy credits that they can then sell to their utility, additionally (utilities are interested in buying these renewable energy credits because it allows them to claim that they produce renewable energy). In some special cases, producing households may be paid up to four times the standard electricity rate, but this is not common.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith, Kate.

[[File:Solar panels in Ogiinuur.jpg|thumb|left|250px|An installation of [[solar panel]]s in rural Mongolia]]

Solar power harnesses the energy of the sun to make electricity. Two typical methods for converting solar energy into electricity are [[Solar cells|photo-voltaic cells]] that are organized into panels and [[concentrated solar power]], which uses mirrors to concentrate sunlight to either heat a fluid that runs an [[electrical generator]] via a [[steam turbine]] or [[heat engine]], or to simply cast onto photo-voltaic cells.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/solar/csp_program.html Solar Energy Technologies Program: Concentrating Solar Power]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 19 October 2010. Web. 31 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"&gt;McDilda, Diane Gow. The Everything Green Living Book: Easy Ways to Conserve Energy, Protect Your Family's Health, and Help save the Environment. Avon, MA: Adams Media, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The energy created by photo-voltaic cells is a [[direct current]] and has to be converted to [[alternating current]] before it can be used in a household. At this point, users can choose to either store this direct current in batteries for later use, or use an AC/DC inverter for immediate use. To get the best out of a solar panel, the [[angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] of the sun should be between 20 and 50 degrees. Solar power via photo-voltaic cells are usually the most expensive method to harnessing renewable energy, but is falling in price as technology advances and public interest increases. It has the advantages of being portable, easy to use on an individual basis, readily available for government grants and incentives, and being flexible regarding location (though it is most efficient when used in hot, arid areas since they tend to be the most sunny).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; For those that are lucky, affordable rental schemes may be found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Concentrated solar power plants are typically used on more of a community scale rather than an individual household scale, because of the amount of energy they are able to harness but can be done on an individual scale with a [[parabolic reflector]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"&gt;Jeffery, Yvonne, Michael Grosvenor, and Liz Barclay. Green Living for Dummies. Indianapolis, IN: Wiley Pub., 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar thermal energy]] is harnessed by collecting direct heat from the sun. One of the most common ways that this method is used by households is through [[solar water heating]]. In a broad perspective, these systems involve well insulated tanks for storage and collectors, are either passive or active systems (active systems have pumps that continuously circulate water through the collectors and storage tank) and, in active systems, involve either directly heating the water that will be used or heating a non-freezing heat-transfer fluid that then heats the water that will be used. Passive systems are cheaper than active systems since they do not require a pumping system (instead, they take advantage of the natural movement of hot water rising above cold water to cycle the water being used through the collector and storage tank).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energysavers.gov/your_home/water_heating/index.cfm/mytopic=12850 Energy Savers: Solar Water Heaters]. Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy. US Department of Energy, 20 October 2010. Web. 28 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods of harnessing solar power are [[Solar combisystem|solar space heating]] (for heating internal building spaces), solar drying (for drying wood chips, fruits, grains, etc.), [[solar cookers]], [[Solar distillation|solar distillers]], and other [[passive solar]] technologies (simply, harnessing sunlight without any mechanical means).

Wind power is harnessed through turbines, set on tall towers (typically 20’ or 6m with 10‘ or 3m diameter blades for an individual household‘s needs) that power a generator that creates electricity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; They typically require an average of wind speed of 9&amp;nbsp;mi/hr (14&amp;nbsp;km/hr) to be worth their investment (as prescribed by the US Department of Energy), and are capable of paying for themselves within their lifetimes. Wind turbines in urban areas usually need to be mounted at least 30’ (10m) in the air to receive enough wind and to be void of nearby obstructions (such as neighboring buildings). Mounting a wind turbine may also require permission from authorities. Wind turbines have been criticized for the noise they produce, their appearance, and the argument that they can affect the migratory patterns of birds (their blades obstruct passage in the sky). Wind turbines are much more feasible for those living in rural areas&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; and are one of the most cost-effective forms of renewable energy per kilowatt, approaching the cost of fossil fuels, and have quick paybacks.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

For those that have a body of water flowing at an adequate speed (or falling from an adequate height) on their property, [[hydroelectricity]] may be an option. On a large scale, hydroelectricity, in the form of dams, has adverse environmental and social impacts. When on a small scale, however, in the form of single turbines, hydroelectricity is very sustainable. Single water turbines or even a group of single turbines are not environmentally or socially disruptive. On an individual household basis, single turbines are the probably the only economically feasible route (but can have high paybacks and is one of the most efficient methods of renewable energy production). It is more common for an eco-village to use this method rather than a singular household.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

Geothermal energy production involves harnessing the hot water or steam below the earth’s surface, in reservoirs, to produce energy. Because the hot water or steam that is used is reinjected back into the reservoir, this source is considered sustainable. However, those that plan on getting their electricity from this source should be aware that there is controversy over the lifespan of each geothermal reservoir as some believe that their lifespans are naturally limited (they cool down over time, making geothermal energy production there eventually impossible). This method is often large scale as the system required to harness geothermal energy can be complex and requires deep drilling equipment. There do exist small individual scale geothermal operations, however, which harness reservoirs very close to the Earth’s surface, avoiding the need for extensive drilling and sometimes even taking advantage of lakes or ponds where there is already a depression. In this case, the heat is captured and sent to a [[geothermal heat pump]] system located inside the shelter or facility that needs it (often, this heat is used directly to warm a greenhouse during the colder months).&lt;ref name="Jeffery, Yvonne 2008"/&gt; Although geothermal energy is available everywhere on Earth, practicality and cost-effectiveness varies, directly related to the depth required to reach reservoirs. Places such as the Philippines, Hawaii,  Alaska, Iceland, California, and Nevada have geothermal reservoirs closer to the Earth’s surface, making its production cost-effective.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

Biomass power is created when any biological matter is burned as fuel. As with the case of using green materials in a household, it is best to use as much locally available material as possible so as to reduce the carbon footprint created by transportation. Although burning biomass for fuel releases [[carbon dioxide]], sulfur compounds, and nitrogen compounds into the atmosphere, a major concern in a sustainable lifestyle, the amount that is released is sustainable (it will not contribute to a rise in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere). This is because the biological matter that is being burned releases the same amount of carbon dioxide that it consumed during its lifetime.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt; However, burning [[biodiesel]] and bioethanol (see [[biofuel]]) when created from virgin material, is increasingly controversial and may or may not be considered sustainable because it inadvertently increases global poverty, the clearing of more land for new agriculture fields (the source of the biofuel is also the same source of food), and may use unsustainable growing methods (such as the use of environmentally harmful pesticides and fertilizers).&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester Russell. Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to save Civilization. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Digestion of organic material to produce methane is becoming an increasingly popular method of biomass energy production. Materials such as waste sludge can be digested to release methane gas that can then be burnt to produce electricity. Methane gas is also a natural by-product of landfills, full of decomposing waste, and can be harnessed here to produce electricity as well. The advantage in burning methane gas is that is prevents the methane from being released into the atmosphere, exacerbating the greenhouse effect. Although this method of biomass energy production is typically large scale (done in landfills), it can be done on a smaller individual or community scale as well.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2007"/&gt;

==Food==
Globally, food accounts for 48% and 70% of household environmental impacts on land and water resources respectively, with consumption of meat, dairy and processed food rising quickly with income&lt;sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivanova"/&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Environmental impacts of industrial agriculture===

[[Industrial agriculture|Industrial agricultural production]] is highly resource and energy intensive.  Industrial agriculture systems typically require heavy [[irrigation]], extensive [[Pesticide application|pesticide]] and [[Fertilizer|fertilizer application]], intensive [[tillage]], concentrated [[monoculture]] production, and other continual inputs. As a result of these industrial farming conditions, today’s mounting environmental stresses are further exacerbated. These stresses include: declining [[water table]]s, chemical [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]], chemical [[Surface runoff|runoff]], [[soil erosion]], [[land degradation]], loss in [[biodiversity]], and other ecological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conventional food distribution and long distance transport===

[[Conventional]] food distribution and long distance transport are additionally [[resource]] and [[energy]] exhaustive.  Substantial climate-disrupting [[carbon emissions]], boosted by the transport of food over long distances, are of growing concern as the world faces such [[global crisis]] as [[natural resource]] depletion, [[peak oil]] and [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;Heinberg, Richard. ''Powerdown: Options and Actions for a Post-Carbon World''. Canada: New Society Publishers, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; “The average American meal currently costs about 1500 miles, and takes about 10 [[calorie]]s of oil and other [[fossil fuel]]s to produce a single calorie of food.”&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"&gt;Astyk, Sharon. ''Depletion and Abundance: Life on the New Home Front''. Canada: New Society Publishers,  2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Local and seasonal foods===

A more sustainable means of acquiring food is to purchase locally and seasonally. Buying food from local farmers reduces [[carbon output]], caused by long-distance food transport, and stimulates the local economy.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt; Local, small-scale farming operations also typically utilize more sustainable methods of agriculture than conventional industrial farming systems such as decreased tillage, [[nutrient cycling]], fostered biodiversity and reduced chemical pesticide and fertilizer applications.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"&gt;Shiva, Vandana. ''Stolen Harvest: The Hijacking of the Global Food Supply''. Cambridge, MA: South End Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Adapting a more regional, seasonally based diet is more sustainable as it entails purchasing less energy and resource demanding produce that naturally grow within a local area and require no long-distance transport. These vegetables and fruits are also grown and harvested within their suitable [[growing season]]. Thus, [[seasonal food]] farming does not require energy intensive [[greenhouse]] production, extensive irrigation, plastic packaging and long-distance transport from importing non-regional foods, and other environmental stressors.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"&gt;Seymour, John. ''The Self-Sufficient Life and How to Live It''. London: DK Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Local, seasonal produce is typically fresher, unprocessed and argued to be more nutritious. Local produce also contains less to no chemical residues from applications required for long-distance shipping and handling.&lt;ref&gt;Princen, Thomas. ''The Logic of Sufficiency''. New York: MIT Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Farmers' market]]s, public events where local small-scale farmers gather and sell their produce, are a good source for obtaining local food and knowledge about local farming productions.  As well as promoting localization of food, farmers markets are a central gathering place for community interaction.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"&gt;Todd, J. and N. J. Todd. ''From Eco-Cities to Living Machines: Principles of Ecological Design''. Berkeley, CA:  North Atlantic Books, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way to become involved in regional food distribution is by joining a local [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA). A CSA consists of a community of growers and consumers who pledge to support a farming operation while equally sharing the risks and benefits of food production. CSA's usually involve a system of weekly pick-ups of locally farmed vegetables and fruits, sometimes including dairy products, meat and special food items such as baked goods.&lt;ref&gt;Nabhan, Gary. ''Coming Home to Eat''. Berkeley, CA: W.W. Norton, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Considering the previously noted rising environmental crisis, the United States and much of the world is facing immense vulnerability to famine. Local food production ensures food security if potential transportation disruptions and climatic, economical, and sociopolitical disasters were to occur.&lt;ref name="Astyk, Sharon 2008"/&gt;

===Reducing meat consumption===

Industrial meat production also involves high environmental costs such as [[land degradation]], [[soil erosion]] and depletion of [[natural resource]]s, especially pertaining to water and food.&lt;ref name="Seymour, John 2003"/&gt; Mass meat production increase the amount of [[Atmospheric methane|methane in the atmosphere]].  For more information on the [[environmental impact of meat production]] and consumption, see the [[ethics of eating meat]]. Reducing meat consumption, perhaps to a few meals a week, or adopting a vegetarian or vegan diet, alleviates the demand for environmentally damaging industrial meat production. Buying and consuming organically raised, [[free range]] or [[Grass fed|grass fed meat]] is another alternative towards more sustainable meat consumption.&lt;ref name="Shiva, Vandana 2000"/&gt;

===Organic farming===

Purchasing and supporting organic products is another fundamental contribution to sustainable living. [[Organic farming]] is a rapidly emerging trend in the food industry and in the web of sustainability. According to the [[USDA]] [[National Organic Standards Board]] (NOSB), [[organic agriculture]] is defined as "an ecological production management system that promotes and enhances biodiversity, biological cycles, and soil biological activity. It is based on minimal use of off-farm inputs and on management practices that restore, maintain, or enhance ecological harmony. The primary goal of organic agriculture is to optimize the health and productivity of interdependent communities of soil life, plants, animals and people." Upon sustaining these goals, organic agriculture uses techniques such as [[crop rotation]], [[permaculture]], [[compost]], [[green manure]] and [[biological pest control]]. In addition, organic farming prohibits or strictly limits the use of manufactured fertilizers and pesticides, [[plant growth regulators]] such as [[hormones]], livestock [[antibiotics]], [[food additives]] and [[genetically modified organisms]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html Organic Agriculture - What is Organic Agriculture?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101018130008/http://extension.agron.iastate.edu/organicag/whatis.html |date=18 October 2010 }} Iowa State University. 2008. Web. Retrieved on: 18 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Organically farmed products include vegetables, fruit, grains, herbs, meat, dairy, eggs, fibers, and flowers. See [[organic certification]] for more information.

===Urban gardening===
[[File:Ganjiaxiang - edible landscaping - P1070640.JPG|thumb|"Edible landscaping": a vegetable garden incorporated by the local residents into a roadside park. [[Qixia District]], [[Nanjing]], China]]
In addition to local, small-scale farms, there has been a recent emergence in [[urban agriculture]] expanding from [[community gardens]] to private [[home gardens]]. With this trend, both farmers and ordinary people are becoming involved in [[food production]]. A network of urban farming systems helps to further ensure regional food security and encourages self-sufficiency and cooperative interdependence within communities.&lt;ref&gt;Flores, H.C. ''Food Not Lawns: How to Turn Your Yard into a Garden and Your Neighborhood into a Community''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; With every bite of food raised from urban gardens, negative environmental impacts are reduced in numerous ways. For instance, vegetables and fruits raised within small-scale gardens and farms are not grown with tremendous applications of [[nitrogen fertilizer]] required for industrial agricultural operations. The nitrogen fertilizers cause toxic chemical leaching and runoff that enters our water tables. Nitrogen fertilizer also produces [[nitrous oxide]], a more damaging [[greenhouse gas]] than [[carbon dioxide]]. Local, community-grown food also requires no imported, long-distance transport which further depletes our [[fossil fuel]] reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Nyerges, Christopher. ''Urban Wilderness: a guidebook to resourceful city living''. Culver, CA: Peace Press, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; In developing more efficiency per land acre, urban gardens can be started in a wide variety of areas: in vacant lots, public parks, private yards, church and school yards, on roof tops ([[roof-top garden]]s), and many other places.  Communities can work together in changing zoning limitations in order for public and private gardens to be permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Hemenway, Toby. ''Gaia’s Garden''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Aesthetically pleasing [[edible landscaping]] plants can also be incorporated into city landscaping such as blueberry bushes, grapevines trained on an arbor, pecan trees, etc.&lt;ref name="Todd, J 1994"/&gt; With as small a scale as home or community farming, sustainable and organic farming methods can easily be utilized. Such sustainable, organic farming techniques include: [[composting]], [[biological pest control]], [[crop rotation]], [[mulching]], [[drip irrigation]], [[nutrient cycling]] and [[permaculture]].&lt;ref&gt;Warde, Jon, ed. ''The Backyard Builder: Over 150 Projects for Your Garden, Home and Yard''. New York:  Random House, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information on sustainable farming systems, see [[sustainable agriculture]].

===Food preservation and storage===

Preserving and storing foods reduces reliance on long-distance transported food and the market industry. Home-grown foods can be preserved and stored outside of their growing season and continually consumed throughout the year, enhancing self-sufficiency and independence from the supermarket. Food can be preserved and saved by [[Dehydration (food)|dehydration]], [[Freezing (food)|freezing]], [[vacuum packing]], [[canning]], [[bottling]], [[pickling]] and jellying.&lt;ref&gt;Ciperthwaite, Wm. ''A Handmade Life: In Search of Simplicity''. New York: Chelsea Green, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; For more information, see [[food preservation]].

==Transportation==
{{main|Sustainable transport}}
[[File:20120623 ChevyVolt-Chicago-Compost.jpg|thumb|A [[carsharing]] [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicle being used to drop off [[compost]] at an urban facility in [[Chicago]].]]
With rising [[peak oil]] concerns, [[climate warming]] exacerbated by [[carbon emissions]] and high energy prices, the conventional [[automobile industry]] is becoming less and less feasible to the conversation of sustainability. Revisions of [[Public transport|urban transport]] systems that foster mobility, low-cost transportation and healthier urban environments are needed. Such urban transport systems should consist of a combination of [[rail transport]], [[bus transport]], [[bicycle]] pathways and [[pedestrian]] [[walkways]]. Public transport systems such as underground rail systems and bus transit systems shift huge numbers of people away from reliance on car [[mobilization]] and dramatically reduce the rate of carbon emissions caused by automobile transport.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009"&gt;Brown, Lester R. ''Plan B 4.0: Mobilizing to Save Civilization''. New York: W.W. Norton, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carpooling]] is another alternative for reducing oil consumption and carbon emissions by transit.

In comparison to automobiles, bicycles are a paragon of energy efficient personal transportation with the bicycle roughly 50 times more energy efficient than driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/14/science/the-bicycle-and-the-ride-to-modern-america.html|title=The Bicycle and the Ride to Modern America|date=13 July 2015|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bicycles increase mobility while alleviating [[Traffic congestion|congestion]], lowering [[Air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]], and increasing [[physical exercise]].

A recent boom has occurred in [[electric bicycles|electric bikes]] especially in China and other Asian countries. Electric bikes are similar to [[plug-in hybrid]] vehicles in that they are battery powered and can be plugged into the provincial [[electric grid]] for recharging as needed. In contrast to plug-in hybrid cars, electric bikes do not directly use any [[fossil fuels]].  Adequate sustainable urban transportation is dependent upon proper city [[infrastructure]] and planning that incorporates efficient public transit along with bicycle and pedestrian-friendly pathways.&lt;ref name="Brown, Lester R. 2009" /&gt;  Patrick Maria Johnson was the founder of this.

==Water==
{{Contradicts other|date=December 2013|1=Water efficiency}}
{{main|Water efficiency}}
A major factor of sustainable living involves that which no human can live without, [[water]]. Unsustainable water use has far reaching implications for humankind.  Currently, humans use one-fourth of the Earth’s total fresh water in natural circulation, and over half the accessible [[Surface runoff|runoff]].&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution''. New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[population growth]] and water demand is ever increasing. Thus, it is necessary to use available water more efficiently. In sustainable living, one can use water more sustainably through a series of simple, everyday measures.  These measures involve considering indoor [[home appliance]] efficiency, outdoor water use, and daily water use awareness.

===Indoor home appliances===

Housing and [[commercial buildings]] account for 12 percent of America’s freshwater withdrawals.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt;  A typical American single family home uses about {{convert|70|USgal|L}} per person per day indoors.&lt;ref name="Hawken, Paul 1999"/&gt; This use can be reduced by simple alterations in behavior and upgrades to [[Home appliance|appliance]] quality.

====Toilets====

[[Toilets]] accounted for almost 30% of residential indoor water use in the United States in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/watersense/pubs/indoor.html Indoor Water Use in the United States] WaterSense: An EPA Partnership Program. US Environmental Protection Agency, 9 November 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; One flush of a standard U.S. toilet requires more water than most individuals, and many families, in the world use for all their needs in an entire day.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul"&gt;Hawken, Paul, Amory Lovins, and L. Hunter Lovins. ''Natural Capitalism: Creating the Next Industrial Revolution.'' New York City: Little, Brown and Company, 1999. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
A home’s toilet water sustainability can be improved in one of two ways: improving the current toilet or installing a more efficient toilet.  To improve the current toilet, one possible method is to put weighted plastic bottles in the toilet tank.  Also, there are inexpensive tank banks or float booster available for purchase.  A tank bank is a plastic bag to be filled with water and hung in the toilet tank. A [http://www.floatbooster.com/Product.html float booster] attaches underneath the float ball of pre-1986 three and a half gallon capacity toilets.  It allows these toilets to operate at the same valve and float setting but significantly reduces their water level, saving between one and one and a third gallons of water per flush.  A major waste of water in existing toilets is leaks.  A slow toilet leak is undetectable to the eye, but can waste hundreds of gallons each month.  One way to check this is to put food dye in the tank, and to see if the water in the toilet bowl turns the same color.  In the event of a leaky flapper, one can replace it with an adjustable toilet flapper, which allows self-adjustment of the amount of water per flush.

If installing a new toilet there are a number of options to obtain the most water efficient model. A [[low flush toilet]] uses one to two gallons per flush.  Traditionally, toilets use three to five gallons per flush. If an eighteen-liter per flush toilet is removed and a six-liter per flush toilet is put in its place, 70% of the water flushed will be saved while the overall indoor water use by will be reduced by 30%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html Green Building Health and Environmental Considerations in Building and Renovating Today] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130194906/http://urbanbuildersnyc.com/Green_Building.html |date=30 November 2010 }} Urban Builders Group. Urban Builders Group LTD. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to have a toilet that uses no water.  A [[composting toilet]] treats human waste through [[composting]] and [[dehydration]], producing a valuable soil additive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php What is a Composting Toilet?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120223832/http://compostingtoilet.org/compost_toilets_explained/what_is_a_composting_toilet/index.php |date=20 November 2010 }} Composting Toilet World. Envirolet. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  These toilets feature a two-compartment bowl to separate urine from feces.  The urine can be collected or sold as fertilizer.  The feces can be dried and bagged or composted.  These toilets cost scarcely more than regularly installed toilets and do not require a sewer hookup.  In addition to providing valuable fertilizer, these toilets are highly sustainable because they save sewage collection and treatment, as well as lessen agricultural costs and improve [[topsoil]].

Additionally, one can reduce toilet water sustainability by limiting total toilet flushing. For instance, instead of flushing small wastes, such as tissues, one can dispose of these items in the trash or compost.

On average, showers were 18% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999, at {{convert|6|-|8|USgal|L}} per minute traditionally in America.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; A simple method to reduce this use is to switch to low-flow, high-performance showerheads.  These showerheads use only 1.0-1.5 gpm or less. An alternative to replacing the showerhead is to install a converter. This device arrests a running shower upon reaching the desired temperature.  [[Solar water heater]]s can be used to obtain optimal water temperature, and are more sustainable because they reduce dependence on fossil fuels. To lessen excess water use, water pipes can be insulated with pre-slit foam pipe insulation. This insulation decreases hot water generation time. A simple, straightforward method to conserve water when showering is to take shorter showers.   One method to accomplish this is to turn off the water when it is not necessary (such as while lathering) and resuming the shower when water is necessary.  This can be facilitated when the plumbing or showerhead allow turning off the water without disrupting the desired temperature setting (common in the UK but not the United States).

====Dishwashers and sinks====

On average, sinks were 15% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; There are, however, easy methods to rectify excessive water loss. Available for purchase is a screw-on aerator. This device works by combining water with air thus generating a frothy substance with greater perceived volume, reducing water use by half. Additionally, there is a flip-valve available that allows flow to be turned off and back on at the previously reached temperature. Finally, a [[laminar flow]] device creates a 1.5-2.4 gpm stream of water that reduces water use by half, but can be turned to normal water level when optimal.

In addition to buying the above devices, one can live more sustainably by checking sinks for leaks, and fixing these links if they exist. According to the EPA, "A small drip from a worn faucet washer can waste 20 gallons of water per day, while larger leaks can waste hundreds of gallons".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When washing dishes by hand, it is not necessary to leave the water running for rinsing, and it is more efficient to rinse dishes simultaneously.

On average, dishwashing consumes 1% of indoor water use.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; When using a [[dishwasher]], water can be conserved by only running the machine when it is full.  Some have a "low flow" setting to use less water per wash cycle. Enzymatic [[detergents]] clean dishes more efficiently and more successfully with a smaller amount of water at a lower temperature.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====Washing machines====

On average, 23% of U.S. indoor water use in 1999 was due to clothes washing.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt; In contrast to other machines, American [[washing machines]] have changed little to become more sustainable. A typical washing machine has a vertical-axis design, in which clothes are agitated in a tubful of water. Horizontal-axis machines, in contrast, put less water into the bottom of the rub and rotate clothes through it. These machines are more efficient in terms of soap use and clothing stability.

===Outdoor water use===

There are a number of ways one can incorporate a personal [[yard]], [[roof]], and [[garden]] in more sustainable living. While conserving water is a major element of sustainability, so is sequestering water.

====Conserving water====

In planning a yard and garden space, it is most sustainable to consider the plants, soil, and available water.  Drought resistant shrubs, plants, and grasses require a smaller amount of water in comparison to more traditional species.  Additionally, native plants (as opposed to herbaceous perennials) will use a smaller supply of water and have a heightened resistance to plant diseases of the area.  [[Xeriscaping]] is a technique that selects drought-tolerant plants and accounts for endemic features such as [[slope]], [[soil type]], and [[native plant]] range.  It can reduce landscape water use by 50 – 70%, while providing [[habitat]] space for wildlife.  Plants on slopes help reduce [[Surface runoff|runoff]] by slowing and absorbing accumulated rainfall.  Grouping plants by watering needs further reduces water waste.

After planting, placing a circumference of [[mulch]] surrounding plants functions to lessen [[evaporation]].  To do this, firmly press two to four inches of organic matter along the plant's dripline. This prevents [[water runoff]].   When watering, consider the range of sprinklers; watering paved areas is unnecessary.  Additionally, to conserve the maximum amount of water, watering should be carried out during early mornings on non-windy days to reduce water loss to evaporation.  Drip-irrigation systems and soaker hoses are a more sustainable alternative to the traditional sprinkler system.  Drip-irrigation systems employ small gaps at standard distances in a hose, leading to the slow trickle of water droplets which percolate the soil over a protracted period.  These systems use 30 – 50% less water than conventional methods.&lt;ref&gt;Pinkham, R. and Dyer, J., 1993: "Linking Water and Energy Savings in Irrigation," Rocky Mountain Institute Publication #A94-4.&lt;/ref&gt; Soaker hoses help to reduce water use by up to 90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf Soaker Hoses: Good for your Garden, Your Wallet, and Our Environment] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101011035501/http://www.savingwater.org/docs/successwithsoakerhoses.pdf |date=11 October 2010 }} Saving Water Partnership. Seattle and Participating Area Water Utilities. 2005. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  They connect to a garden hose and lay along the row of plants under a layer of mulch.  A layer of [[organic material]] added to the soil helps to increase its absorption and water retention; previously planted areas can be covered with [[compost]].

In caring for a lawn, there are a number of measures that can increase the sustainability of lawn maintenance techniques.  A primary aspect of lawn care is watering.  To conserve water, it is important to only water when necessary, and to deep soak when watering.  Additionally, a lawn may be left to go dormant, renewing after a dry spell to its original vitality.

====Sequestering water====

A common method of water sequestrations is [[rainwater harvesting]], which incorporates the collection and storage of rain.  Primarily, the rain is obtained from a roof, and stored on the ground in catchment tanks.  Water sequestration varies based on extent, cost, and complexity.   A simple method involves a single barrel at the bottom of a downspout, while a more complex method involves multiple tanks.  It is highly sustainable to use stored water in place of purified water for activities such as irrigation and flushing toilets.  Additionally, using stored rainwater reduces the amount of runoff [[pollution]], picked up from roofs and pavements that would normally enter streams through storm drains.  The following equation can be used to estimate annual water supply:

Collection area (square feet) × Rainfall (inch/year) / 12 (inch/foot) = Cubic Feet of Water/Year

Cubic Feet/Year × 7.43 (Gallons/Cubic Foot) = Gallons/year

Note, however, this calculation does not account for losses such as evaporation or leakage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.portlandonline.com/shared/cfm/image.cfm?id=182095 How to Manage Stormwater: Rain Barrels]. Stormwater Management for Clean Rivers. Environmental Services. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greywater]] systems function in sequestering used indoor water, such as laundry, bath and sink water, and filtering it for reuse.  Greywater can be reused in [[irrigation]] and toilet flushing.  There are two types of greywater systems: gravity fed manual systems and package systems.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"&gt;[http://www.greenbuildingsupply.com/Public/Energy-WaterConservation/GreywaterSystems/index.cfm Greywater Systems: Reusing Bath, Laundry, and Sink Water to Conserve Fresh Water]. Green Building Supply. 2010. Web. 10 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The manual systems do not require electricity but may require a larger yard space.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;  The package systems require electricity but are self-contained and can be installed indoors.&lt;ref name="greenbuildingsupply1"/&gt;

==Waste==

As populations and resource demands climb, waste production contributes to [[Greenhouse gas#Greenhouse gas emissions|emissions]] of [[carbon dioxide]], leaching of hazardous materials into the soil and waterways, and [[methane emissions]].  In America alone, over the course of a decade, 500 trillion pounds of American resources will have been transformed into nonproductive wastes and gases.&lt;ref name="HawkenPaul" /&gt; Thus, a crucial component of sustainable living is being waste conscious.  One can do this by reducing waste, reusing commodities, and recycling.

There are a number of ways to reduce waste in sustainable living.  Two methods to reduce paper waste are canceling junk mail like [https://www.optoutprescreen.com/?rf=t credit card and insurance offers] and [http://www.dmachoice.org/ direct mail marketing] and changing monthly paper statements to paperless emails.  Junk mail alone accounted for 1.72 million tons of landfill waste in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.catalogchoice.org/environmental-facts|title=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service - Put an end to junk mail, catalogs, and phone books.|website=CatalogChoice Mail Preference Service|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method to reduce waste is to buy in bulk, reducing packaging materials. Preventing food waste can limit the amount of organic waste sent to landfills producing the powerful greenhouse gas methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://earthwormtechnologies.com/about-us/|title=Our Story|first=Earthworm|last=Technologies®|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of waste reduction involves being cognizant of purchasing excessive amounts when buying materials with limited use like cans of paint. Non-hazardous or less hazardous alternatives can also limit the toxicity of waste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Reduce] United States Environmental Protection Agency. 5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

By reusing materials, one lives more sustainably by not contributing to the addition of waste to landfills. Reusing saves [[natural resources]] by decreasing the necessity of [[raw material]] extraction. For example, reusable bags can reduce the amount of waste created by grocery shopping eliminating the need to create and ship plastic bags and the need to manage their disposal and recycling or polluting effects.

[[Recycling]], a process that breaks down used items into raw materials to make new materials, is a particularly useful means of contributing to the renewal of goods.  Recycling incorporates three primary processes; collection and processing, manufacturing, and purchasing recycled products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/osw/conserve/rrr/recycle.htm Wastes – Resource Conservation – Reduce, Reuse, Recycle] United States Environmental Protection Agency.  5 May 2010. Web 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  A natural example of recycling involves using food waste as compost to enrich the quality of soil, which can be carried out at home or locally with community [[composting]]. An offshoot of recycling, [[upcycling]], strives to convert material into something of similar or greater value in its second life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php UpCycle] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101112170212/http://www.sustainabilitydictionary.com/u/upcycle.php |date=12 November 2010 }} Sustainability Management. Presidio Graduate School. Web. 10 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; By integrating measures of reusing, reducing, and recycling one can effectively reduce personal waste and use materials in a more sustainable manner.

==History==
[[File:Parrish Hall.jpg|thumb|Parrish Hall, named in honor of the first president, [[Edward Parrish]] (1822–1872), contains the admissions, housing, and financial aid offices, along with student housing on the upper floors.]]
The name "Swarthmore" has its roots in early [[Quakers|Quaker]] history. In [[England]], [[Swarthmoor Hall]] near the town of [[Ulverston, England|Ulverston]], [[Cumbria]], (previously in [[Lancashire]]) was the home of Thomas and Margaret Fell in 1652 when [[George Fox]], (1624–1691), fresh from his epiphany atop [[Pendle Hill]] in 1651, came to visit. The visitation turned into a long association, as Fox persuaded Thomas and Margaret Fell of his views. Swarthmoor was used for the first meetings of what became known as the Religious Society of Friends (later colloquially labeled "The Quakers").

The College was founded in 1864 by a committee of Quakers who were members of the [[Philadelphia]], [[New York City|New York]] and [[Baltimore]] Yearly Meetings of the Religious Society of Friends. [[Edward Parrish]] (1822–1872) was its first president. [[Lucretia Mott]] (1793–1880) and [[Martha Ellicott Tyson]] (1795–1873)&lt;ref name="msa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msa.maryland.gov/msa/educ/exhibits/womenshall/html/tyson.html|title=Maryland Women's Hall of Fame: Martha Ellicott Tyson|publisher=Maryland State Archives|accessdate=7 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among those Friends, who insisted that the new college of Swarthmore be coeducational. Edward Hicks Magill, the second president, served for 17 years.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Hope Bacon (1980), ''"Valiant Friend: The Life of Lucretia Mott"'', page 199, {{ISBN|1-888305-09-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter, [[Helen Magill White|Helen Magill]], (1853–1944), was in the first class to graduate in 1873; in 1877, she was the first woman in the [[United States]] to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree, ([[PhD|Ph.D.]]); hers was in [[Greek language|Greek]] from [[Boston University]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="ArchiveWomens2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|title=Women's, Gender, &amp; Sexuality Studies Faculty » Women's, Gender &amp; Sexuality Studies Program&amp;nbsp;– Boston University|publisher=web.archive.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131012035256/http://www.bu.edu/wgs/community/womens-studies-family/|archivedate=2013-10-12|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1900s, the College had a major collegiate [[Swarthmore Garnet Tide football|American football program]] during the formation period of the soon-to-be nationwide sport, (playing [[United States Naval Academy|Navy]], ([[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis]]), [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Columbia University|Columbia]], and other larger schools) and an active fraternity and sorority life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During [[World War II]], Swarthmore was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]], which offered students a path to a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] commission.&lt;ref name="swarthmore-v-122"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2010/02/19/swarthmore-at-war-part-1/|title=Daily Gazette|last=|first=|year=2011|publisher=[[Swarthmore, Pennsylvania]]: Swarthmore College|accessdate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wolfgang Köhler]], [[Hans Wallach]] and [[Solomon Asch]] were noted psychologists who became professors at Swarthmore, a center for Gestalt psychology. Both Wallach, who was Jewish, and Köhler, who was not, had left [[Nazi Germany]] because of its discriminatory policies against Jews. Köhler came to Swarthmore in 1935 and served until his retirement in 1958. Wallach came in 1936, first as a researcher, and also teaching from 1942 until 1975. Asch, who was Polish-American and had immigrated as a child to the US in 1920, joined the faculty in 1947 and served until 1966, conducting his [[Asch conformity experiments|noted conformity experiments]] at Swarthmore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simplypsychology.org/asch-conformity.html|title=Asch Experiment|accessdate=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s saw the construction of new buildings – the Sharples Dining Hall in 1964,  the Worth Health Center in 1965, the Dana/Hallowell Residence Halls in 1967, and the Lang Music Building in 1973.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; They also saw a 1967 review of the college initiated by President Courtney Smith, a 1969 black protest movement, in which African-American students conducted an eight-day [[sit-in]] in the admissions office to demand increased black enrollment, and the establishment of the Black Cultural Center (1970) and the Women's Resource Center (1974).&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/timeline/1969-black-student-protest-movement|title=1969 black student protest movement|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.swarthmore.edu/timeline/1975-alice-paul-05-and-womens-center|title=1975 Alice Paul '05 and the women's center|publisher=Swarthmore College|accessdate=April 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Environmental Studies program and the Intercultural Center were established in 1992, and in 1993 the Lang Performing Arts Center was opened; the Kohlberg Hall was then established in 1996 and a renovation of the Trotter hall was undertaken in 1997.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; In 1999 the college began purchasing [[renewable energy credit]]s in the form of [[wind power]], and in the 2002–2003 academic year it constructed its first [[green roof]].&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt; In 2008, Swarthmore's first mascot, Phineas the Phoenix, made its debut.&lt;ref name="briefhist"/&gt;

==Academics==
[[File:Swarthmore College Observatory.jpg|thumb|Observatory|left]]
Swarthmore's [[Oxbridge]] [[tutorial]]-inspired Honors Program allows students to take double-credit seminars from their third year and often write honors [[Thesis|theses]]. Seminars are usually composed of four to eight students. Students in seminars will usually write at least three ten-page papers per seminar, and often one of these papers is expanded into a 20–30 page paper by the end of the seminar. At the end of their final year, Honors students take oral and written examinations conducted by outside experts in their field. Usually one student in each discipline is awarded "Highest Honors"; others are either awarded "High Honors" or "Honors"; rarely, a student is denied Honors altogether by the outside examiner.

==Campus==
[[File:Swarthmore_Parrish_Hall.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Parrish Hall from Magill Walk]]
The campus consists of {{convert|425|acre|km2}}, based on a north-south axis anchored by Parrish Hall, which houses numerous administrative offices and student lounges, as well as two floors of student housing. The fourth floor houses [[campus radio]] station [[WSRN-FM]] as well as the weekly student newspaper, ''The Phoenix''.  Many acres are wooded and include trails.

From the [[Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority|SEPTA]] [[Swarthmore (SEPTA station)|Swarthmore commuter train station]] and the "ville" or borough of Swarthmore to the south, the oak-lined Magill Walk leads north up a hill to Parrish. The campus is coterminous with the grounds of the [[Scott Arboretum]], cited by some as a main staple of the campus's renowned beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greaterphiladelphiagardens.org/press.asp?PressReleaseID=33|title=Press Releases from|publisher=Greater Philadelphia Gardens|accessdate=2011-03-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726131755/http://www.greaterphiladelphiagardens.org/press.asp?PressReleaseID=33|archivedate=2011-07-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, [[Travel+Leisure]] named Swarthmore one of the most beautiful college campuses in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/americas-most-beautiful-college-campuses/16 "America's most beautiful college campuses", ''Travel+Leisure'' (September 2011)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the buildings housing classrooms and department offices are located to the north of Parrish, as are Kyle and Woolman dormitories. McCabe Library is to the east of Parrish, as are the dorms of Willets, Mertz, Worth, The Lodges, Alice Paul, and David Kemp. To the west are the dorms of Wharton, Dana, Hallowell, and Danawell, along with the Scott Amphitheater, an open wooded outdoor amphitheater, in which graduations and college collections (meetings) are held. The Crum Woods extend westward from the main campus, and many buildings on the forest side of the campus incorporate views of the woods. South of Parrish are Sharples dining hall, the two non-residential fraternities (Phi Psi and Delta Upsilon), and various other buildings. Palmer, Pittenger, and Roberts dormitories are south of the railroad station, as are the athletic facilities, while the Mary Lyon dorm is off-campus to the southwest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/visitordash/campus_map.pdf|title=Visitors|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The College has three main libraries (McCabe Library, the Cornell Library of Science and Engineering, and the Underhill Music and Dance Library) and seven other specialized collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/x4593.xml|title=Libraries|publisher=|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1923, McCabe library has been a [[Federal Depository Library Program|Federal Depository library]] for selected U.S. Government documents.

===Friends Historical Library===
Friends Historical Library was established in 1871 to collect, preserve, and make available archival, manuscript, printed, and visual records concerning the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) from their origins mid-seventeenth century to the present. Besides the focus on Quaker history, the holdings are a significant research collection for the regional and local history of the middle-Atlantic region of the United States and the history of American social reform. Quakers played prominent roles in almost every major reform movement in American history, including abolition, African-American history, Indian rights, women's rights, prison reform, humane treatment of the mentally ill, and temperance. The collections also reflect the significant role Friends played in the development of science, technology, education, and business in Britain and America. The Library also maintains the Swarthmore College Archives and the papers of the Swarthmore Historical Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library|title=Friends Historical Library :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/|title=Swarthmore Historical Society|website=Swarthmore Historical Society|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
Two Greek organizations exist on the campus in the form of [[Fraternities and sororities in North America|fraternities]], [[Delta Upsilon]] and local Phi Psi, a former chapter of [[Phi Kappa Psi]]. A third, [[Phi Sigma Kappa]] fraternity, maintained a chapter on campus from 1906 to 1991 and continues strong alumni involvement.&lt;ref name="ATPS2"&gt;{{Citation|last=Rand|first=Frank Prentice|title=All The Phi Sigs&amp;nbsp;— A History|year=1993|last2=Watts|last3=Sefton|first2=Ralph|first3=James E.|publisher=Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sororities were abandoned in the 1930s following student outrage about discrimination within the sorority system, and leading to a 79-year ban.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1933.html|title=Discrimination in the sorority system|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070419163605/http://www.swarthmore.edu/news/history/1933.html|archivedate=2007-04-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swarthmorephoenix.com/?p=6702 Kappa Alpha Theta Chapter Official at Swarthmore | The Phoenix].

Retrieved on 2014-04-12.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2012, the college announced that the ban on sororities would be reversed as of the 2013 term, citing [[Title IX]] regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/09/28/pennsylvania-college-brings-back-sororities-after-7-year-ban|title=Pennsylvania college brings back sororities after 79-year ban|date=September 28, 2012|publisher=Fox News|location=New York|accessdate=September 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four women who helped overturn the ban subsequently spearheaded the reestablishment of a [[Kappa Alpha Theta]] chapter the following spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-03-25/news/31236934_1_sororities-swarthmore-college-student-newspapers|title=Reversing an old ban on sororities at Swarthmore|website=philly-archives|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/28/14134347-sororities-to-return-to-swarthmore-college-for-first-time-in-80-years?lite|title=Sororities to return to Swarthmore College for first time in 80 years|publisher=NBC News|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement sparked controversy on campus; a petition seeking a referendum to continue the ban was dismissed, again citing a legal opinion that to disallow the sorority chapter would be a violation of Title IX regulations. The sorority admitted its first pledge class in the Spring of 2013. A further non-binding referendum was later distributed, but by then the controversy had cooled: Of the six items on the referendum, only one passed, which asked "Do you support admitting students of all genders to sororities and fraternities?" No action was taken on the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daily.swarthmore.edu/2013/02/26/17685/ StuCo Report: Referendum Not Binding | Daily Gazette]. Daily.swarthmore.edu (2013-02-26).

===Athletics===
Swarthmore has a variety of sporting teams with a total of 22 [[NCAA Division III]] varsity intercollegiate sports teams. 40 percent of Swarthmore students play intercollegiate or club sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/library/friends/ead/6I001physed.xml|title=Swarthmore College Physical Education and Athletics records, 1921–1996|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Varsity teams include [[badminton]], [[baseball]], [[basketball]], [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[lacrosse]], [[soccer]], [[softball]], [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]], [[tennis]], [[track and field]] and [[volleyball]]. The [[Swarthmore Garnet Tide football|football team]] was controversially eliminated in 2000, along with [[wrestling]] and, initially, badminton. The Board of Managers cited lack of athletes on campus and difficulty of recruiting as reasons for terminating the programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003-12-04/news/13551 Three years later, athletics shows improvement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705035151/http://phoenix.swarthmore.edu/2003-12-04/news/13551|date=July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/daily/specials/sportscut/index.html Athlete recruiting difficulty] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609135404/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/daily/specials/sportscut/index.html|date=June 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swarthmore also offers a number of club sport options, including men's and women's [[Rugby union|rugby]], [[ultimate frisbee]], [[volleyball]], [[fencing]], [[Squash (sport)|squash]], and [[Quidditch (sport)|quidditch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/sports/2013/6/17/GEN_0617135419.aspx|title=Swarthmore College Club Sports and Student Activity Groups 2015–2016|accessdate=13 January 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104224647/http://www.swarthmoreathletics.com/sports/2013/6/17/GEN_0617135419.aspx|archivedate=4 January 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarthmore is a charter member of the [[Centennial Conference]], a group of private colleges in Pennsylvania and Maryland.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centennial.org/information/about|title=The Centennial Conference|accessdate=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarthmore's varsity women's soccer team has won the Centennial Conference Championship three times (2014, 2017, 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.centennial.org/sports/wsoc/History|title=History|date=2018-10-28|work=Centennial Conference|access-date=2018-11-07|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student safety===
Based on federal campus safety data for 2014, Swarthmore College was the third highest in the nation in "total reports of rape per 1,000 students" on its main campus, with 11 reports of rape per 1,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2016/06/07/these-colleges-have-the-most-reports-of-rape/|title=These colleges have the most reports of rape|last=Anderson|first=Nick|date=2016-06-07|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
[[File:Ben West birthplace Swarthmore PA obl.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Benjamin West Birthplace|birthplace of Benjamin West]] is on campus.]]
Swarthmore has two main student news publications. The weekly newspaper, ''The Phoenix'', is published nearly every Thursday. Founded in 1881, the paper began putting stories online in 1995. Two thousand copies are distributed across the college campus and to the Borough of Swarthmore. The newspaper is printed by Bartash Printing in Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thecollegefix.com/post/29066/|title=Swarthmore student newspaper apologizes for op-ed telling students to 'stop whining' – The College Fix|date=2016-09-19|work=The College Fix|access-date=2017-04-27|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of magazines at Swarthmore, most of which are published semiannually at the end of each semester. One is ''Spike'', Swarthmore's humor magazine, founded in 1993. The others are literary magazines, including ''Nacht'', which publishes long-form non-fiction, fiction, poetry, and artwork; ''Small Craft Warnings'', which publishes poetry, fiction and artwork; ''Scarlet Letters'', which publishes women's literature; ''Enie'', for Spanish literature; ''OURstory'', for literature relating to diversity issues; ''Bug-Eyed Magazine'', a very limited-run science fiction/fantasy magazine published by Psi Phi, formerly known as Swarthmore Warders of Imaginative Literature (SWIL); ''Remappings'' (formerly "''CelebrASIAN''"), published by the Swarthmore Asian Organization; ''Alchemy'', a collection of academic writings published by the Swarthmore Writing Associates; ''Mjumbe'', published by the Swarthmore African-American Student Society; and a magazine for French literature. An [[erotica]] magazine, ''!'' (pronounced "bang") was briefly published in 2005 in homage to an earlier publication, ''Untouchables''. Most of the literary magazines print approximately 500 copies, with around 100 pages. There is also a new photography magazine, ''Pun/ctum'', which features work from students and alumni.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/friends-historical-library/swarthmore-college-archives-publications|title=Swarthmore College Archives: Publications :: Friends Historical Library :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A cappella===
The [[collegiate a cappella]] groups include Sixteen Feet, the College's oldest group (founded in 1981), as well as its first and only all-male group. Grapevine is its corresponding all-female group (founded in 1983), and Mixed Company is a co-ed group. Chaverim is a co-ed group that includes students from the [[Tri-College Consortium]] and draws on music from cultures around the world for its repertoire. Lastly, OffBeat was founded in the fall of 2013 as a co-ed group. The groups, self-run as volunteer clubs with college support, travel to other schools to participate in concerts. Once every semester, all of the school's a cappella groups collaborate for a joint concert called Jamboree, which includes visiting groups from other colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmore.edu/living-swarthmore/swarthmores-student-organizations|title=Swarthmore's Student Organizations :: Living@Swarthmore :: Swarthmore College|website=www.swarthmore.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
[[WSRN-FM|WSRN 91.5 FM]] is the college radio station. It has a mix of [[Indie (music)|indie]], [[Rock music|rock]], [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]], [[Folk music|folk]], [[World music|world]], [[jazz]], and [[classical music]], as well as a number of radio [[talk shows]]. At one time, WSRN had a significant news department, and covered events such as the 1969 black protest movement extensively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-01-24/news/11640.html Crisis of '69] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223094241/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2002/2002-01-24/news/11640.html|date=December 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, WSRN centered its programming on the immensely popular "Hank and Bernie Show", starring undergraduates Hank Hanks and Bernie Bernstein. Hank and Bernie conducted wide-ranging and entertaining interviews of sports stars and cultural icons such as Lou Piniella, Mark Grace, Jake Plummer, Greg Ostertag, Andy Karich and Mark "the Bird" Fidrych, and also engaged the Swarthmore community in discussions on campus issues and current events. Upwards of 90 percent of the Swarthmore community would tune in to the Hank and Bernie Show and many members of the surrounding villages and towns would also listen and call in. Many archived recordings of musical and spoken word performances exist, such as the once-annual Swarthmore Folk Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Ralph Lee|date=March 1997|title=If I Had a Song…|url=http://bulletin.swarthmore.edu/bulletin-issue-archive/wp-content/archived_issues_pdf/Bulletin_1997_03.pdf|format=pdf|magazine=Swarthmore College Bulletin|location=Swarthmore, PA|publisher=Swarthmore College|volume=XCIV|issn=0888-2126|access-date=September 8, 2016|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today WSRN focuses virtually exclusively on entertainment, though it has covered significant news developments such as the athletic cuts in 2000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2000/2000-11-30/ Cuts to athletic programs] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222092701/http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/org/phoenix/2000/2000-11-30/|date=December 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]] on campus. War News Radio and The Sudan Radio Project (formerly the Darfur Radio Project) do broadcast news on WSRN, however. Currently, the longest running show in WSRN's lineup is "Oído al Tambor", which focuses on news and music from Latin America. The show has been running non-stop, on Sundays from 4:00 to 6:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., since September 2006. After its members graduated in December 2009, the show's concept was revived by the show "Rayuela", which has been running since September 2009.

===Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association===
Swarthmore College students are eligible to participate in the local emergency department, the Swarthmore Fire and Protective Association. They are trained as firefighters and as emergency medical technicians (EMTs) and are qualified on both the state and national level. The fire department responds to over 200 fire calls and almost 800 EMS calls a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.swarthmorefd.org/ems/|title=Swarthmore Fire &amp; Protective Association :: EMS|website=www.swarthmorefd.org|language=en|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fire horn is located within the Swarthmore campus and its sound has become a fixture of campus life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://swarthmorehistoricalsociety.org/2016/03/11/monthly-swarthmore-history-contest-in-swarthmorean-fire-horn|language=en|access-date=2018-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students affectionately refer to the noise as the call of the Fire Moose or the Space Whale, although the names themselves are in a constant state of evolution.

===Swarthmore College Computer Society===
Swarthmore College Computer Society (SCCS) is a student-run volunteer organization independent of the official ITS department of the college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|title=Swarthmore College Computer Society|website=www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to operating a set of servers that provide e-mail accounts, Unix shell login accounts, server storage space, and webspace to students, professors, alumni, and other student-run organizations, SCCS hosts over 100 mailing lists used by various student groups, and over 130 organizational websites, including the website of the student newspaper, ''The Daily Gazette''. SCCS also provides a computer lab and gaming room, located in Clothier basement beneath Essie Mae's snack bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sccs.swarthmore.edu/about/|title=SCCS – About|website=www.sccs.swarthmore.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Impact====
In September 2003, the SCCS servers survived a [[Slashdotting]] while hosting a copy of the [[Diebold Memos|Diebold memos]] on behalf of the student group [[Free Culture Swarthmore]], then known as the [[Swarthmore Coalition for the Digital Commons]]. SCCS staff promptly complied with the relevant [[DMCA]] takedown request received by the college's ITS department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341683/|title=Swarthmore College's response to the DMCA takedown request|last=Konrad|first=Rachel|date=2003-10-27|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCCS was noted in PC Magazine's article "Top 20 Wired Colleges" as one of the reasons for ranking Swarthmore #4 on that list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,2073408,00.asp|title=Top 20 Wired Colleges|work=PCMAG|accessdate=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 2004–2005 school year, the SCCS Media Lounge served as the early home of War News Radio, a weekly webcast run by Swarthmore students and providing news about the Iraq war, providing resources, space, and technical support for the project in its infancy.

Three SCCS-related papers have been accepted for publication at the USENIX [[Large Installation System Administration Conference|Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference]], one of which was awarded Best Paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa07/|title=21st Large Installation System Administration (LISA) Conference, Dallas, November 11–16, 2007|date=2008-02-05|publisher=Usenix.org|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usenix.org/events/lisa02/tech/stepleton.html Work-Augmented Laziness with the Los Task Request System], Thomas Stepleton.

'''Systems biology''' is the [[computational modeling|computational]] and [[mathematical]] modeling of complex [[biological system]]s. It is a [[biology]]-based interdisciplinary field of study that focuses on complex interactions within biological systems, using a holistic approach ([[holism]] instead of the more traditional [[reductionist|reductionism]]) to biological research.&lt;ref name="Tavassoly 487–500"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tavassoly|first=Iman|last2=Goldfarb|first2=Joseph|last3=Iyengar|first3=Ravi|date=2018-10-04|title=Systems biology primer: the basic methods and approaches|url=http://essays.biochemistry.org/content/early/2018/10/02/EBC20180003|journal=Essays in Biochemistry|volume=62|issue=4|language=en|pages=487–500|doi=10.1042/EBC20180003|issn=0071-1365|pmid=30287586}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly from year 2000 onwards, the concept has been used widely in biology in a variety of contexts. The [[Human Genome Project]] is an example of applied [[systems thinking]] in biology which has led to new, collaborative ways of working on problems in the biological field of genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zewail|first1=Ahmed|title=Physical Biology: From Atoms to Medicine|date=2008|publisher=Imperial College Press|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the aims of systems biology is to model and discover [[emergent property|emergent properties]], properties of [[cell (biology)|cell]]s, [[tissue (biology)|tissue]]s and [[organism]]s functioning as a [[system]] whose theoretical description is only possible using techniques of systems biology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Perspectives on Organisms - Springer|last=Longo|first=Giuseppe|last2=Montévil|first2=Maël|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-35938-5|series = Lecture Notes in Morphogenesis|year = 2014|isbn = 978-3-642-35937-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tavassoly 487–500"/&gt; These typically involve [[metabolic networks]] or [[cell signaling]] networks.&lt;ref name="pmid21570668"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bu Z, Callaway DJ |title=Proteins MOVE!

== Overview ==
Systems biology can be considered from a number of different aspects:

* As a field of study, particularly, the study of the interactions between the components of biological systems, and how these interactions give rise to the function and behavior of that system (for example, the [[enzymes]] and [[metabolites]] in a [[metabolic pathway]] or the heart beats).&lt;ref name="snoep05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="21stcentury" /&gt;&lt;ref name="noble06" /&gt;
* As a [[paradigm]], usually defined in antithesis to the so-called [[reductionist]] paradigm ([[biological organisation]]), although fully consistent with the [[scientific method]]. The distinction between the two paradigms is referred to in these quotations:

:"The [[Reductionism|reductionist]] approach has successfully identified most of the components and many of the interactions but, unfortunately, offers no convincing concepts or methods to understand how system properties emerge&amp;nbsp;... the pluralism of causes and effects in biological networks is better addressed by observing, through quantitative measures, multiple components simultaneously and by rigorous data integration with mathematical models." (Sauer ''et al.'')&lt;ref name="sauer07" /&gt;

:"Systems biology&amp;nbsp;... is about putting together rather than taking apart, integration rather than reduction. It requires that we develop ways of thinking about integration that are as rigorous as our reductionist programmes, but different.&amp;nbsp;... It means changing our philosophy, in the full sense of the term." ([[Denis Noble]])&lt;ref name="noble06" /&gt;

*As a series of operational [[protocol (natural sciences)|protocol]]s used for performing research, namely a cycle composed of theory, [[Mathematical model|analytic]] or [[computational model]]ling to propose specific testable hypotheses about a biological system, experimental validation, and then using the newly acquired quantitative description of cells or cell processes to refine the computational model or theory.&lt;ref name="kholodenko05" /&gt; Since the objective is a model of the interactions in a system, the experimental techniques that most suit systems biology are those that are system-wide and attempt to be as complete as possible. Therefore, [[transcriptomics]], [[metabolomics]], [[proteomics]] and [[High-throughput screening|high-throughput techniques]] are used to collect quantitative data for the construction and validation of models.&lt;ref name=Romualdi09 /&gt;
* As the application of [[dynamical systems theory]] to [[molecular biology]]. Indeed, the focus on the dynamics of the studied systems is the main conceptual difference between systems biology and [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref name=Voit01&gt;{{cite book|last1=Voit|first1=Eberhard|title=A First Course in Systems Biology|date=2012|publisher=Garland Science|isbn=9780815344674}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As a [[Socio-scientific issues|socioscientific]] phenomenon defined by the strategy of pursuing integration of complex data about the interactions in biological systems from diverse experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools and personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

This variety of viewpoints is illustrative of the fact that systems biology refers to a cluster of peripherally overlapping concepts rather than a single well-delineated field. However, the term has widespread currency and popularity as of 2007, with chairs and institutes of systems biology proliferating worldwide.

== History ==
Systems biology finds its roots in:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* the quantitative modeling of [[enzyme kinetics]], a discipline that flourished between 1900 and 1970,
* the mathematical modeling of [[population dynamics]],
* the simulations developed to study [[neurophysiology]],
* [[control theory]] and [[cybernetics]],
* [[Synergetics (Haken)|synergetics]].

One of the theorists who can be seen as one of the precursors of systems biology is [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]] with his [[general systems theory]].&lt;ref name="vonBertalanffy68" /&gt; One of the first numerical simulations in [[cell biology]] was published in 1952 by the British neurophysiologists and Nobel prize winners [[Alan Lloyd Hodgkin]] and [[Andrew Fielding Huxley]], who constructed a mathematical model that explained the [[action potential]] propagating along the [[axon]] of a [[neuron]]al cell.&lt;ref name="hodgkin52" /&gt; Their model described a cellular function emerging from the interaction between two different molecular components, a [[Potassium channel|potassium]] and a [[sodium channel]], and can therefore be seen as the beginning of computational systems biology.&lt;ref name="lenovere07" /&gt;  Also in 1952, Alan Turing published [[The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis]], describing how non-uniformity could arise in an initially homogeneous biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Turing | first1 = A. M. | authorlink = Alan Turing| title = The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis | journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences | volume = 237 | issue = 641 | pages = 37–72 | doi = 10.1098/rstb.1952.0012 | url = http://www.dna.caltech.edu/courses/cs191/paperscs191/turing.pdf| jstor = 92463| year = 1952 | pmid =  | pmc = | bibcode = 1952RSPTB.237...37T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, [[Denis Noble]] developed the first computer model of the [[heart pacemaker]].&lt;ref name="noble60" /&gt;

The formal study of systems biology, as a distinct discipline, was launched by systems theorist [[Mihajlo Mesarovic]] in 1966 with an international symposium at the [[Case Western Reserve University|Case Institute of Technology]] in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], titled "Systems Theory and Biology".&lt;ref name="mesarovic68" /&gt;&lt;ref name="science68" /&gt;

The 1960s and 1970s saw the development of several approaches to study complex molecular systems, such as the [[metabolic control analysis]] and the [[biochemical systems theory]]. The successes of [[molecular biology]] throughout the 1980s, coupled with a skepticism toward [[theoretical biology]], that then promised more than it achieved, caused the quantitative modeling of biological processes to become a somewhat minor field.&lt;ref name="hunter12" /&gt;

However, the birth of [[functional genomics]] in the 1990s meant that large quantities of high-quality data became available, while the computing power exploded, making more realistic models possible. In 1992, then 1994, serial articles &lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "On the holographic model of human body", 1st National Conference of Comparative
Studies Traditional Chinese Medicine and West Medicine, Medicine and Philosophy, April 1992 ("systems medicine and pharmacology" termed).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeng (B.) J., On the concept of system biological engineering, Communication on Transgenic Animals, No. 6, June, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "Transgenic animal expression system – transgenic egg plan (goldegg plan)",
''Communication on Transgenic Animal'', Vol.1, No.11, 1994 (on the concept of system genetics and term coined).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "From positive to synthetic science", ''Communication on Transgenic Animals'', No. 11, 1995 (on systems medicine).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng, "The structure theory of self-organization systems", ''Communication on Transgenic Animals'',
No.8-10, 1996. Etc.&lt;/ref&gt; on systems medicine, systems genetics, and systems biological engineering by B.&amp;nbsp;J. Zeng was published in China and was giving a lecture on biosystems theory and systems-approach research at the First International Conference on Transgenic Animals, Beijing, 1996. In 1997, the group of [[Masaru Tomita]] published the first quantitative model of the metabolism of a whole (hypothetical) cell.&lt;ref name="tomita97" /&gt;

Around the year 2000, after Institutes of Systems Biology were established in [[Seattle]] and [[Tokyo]], systems biology emerged as a movement in its own right, spurred on by the completion of various [[genome projects]], the large increase in data from the [[omics]] (e.g., [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]]) and the accompanying advances in high-throughput experiments and [[bioinformatics]]. Shortly afterwards, the first departments wholly devoted to systems biology were founded (for example, the Department of Systems Biology at Harvard Medical School &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = HMS launches new department to study systems biology | url = https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2003/09/hms-launches-new-department-to-study-systems-biology/ | publisher = Harvard Gazette | date = September 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

In 2003, work at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] was begun on CytoSolve, a method to model the whole cell by dynamically integrating multiple molecular pathway models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc=3032229 | pmid=21423324 | doi=10.1007/s12195-010-0143-x | volume=4 | issue=1 | title=CytoSolve: A Scalable Computational Method for Dynamic Integration of Multiple Molecular Pathway Models | date=March 2011 | journal=Cell Mol Bioeng | pages=28–45 | last1 = Ayyadurai | first1 = VA | last2 = Dewey | first2 = CF}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, various research institutes dedicated to systems biology have been developed. For example, the [[NIGMS]] of [[NIH]] established a project grant that is currently supporting over ten systems biology centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Systems Biology - National Institute of General Medical Sciences | url = http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/SysBio/ | publisher =  | accessdate = 12 December 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131019100123/http://www.nigms.nih.gov/Research/FeaturedPrograms/SysBio/ | archivedate = 19 October 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of summer 2006, due to a shortage of people in systems biology&lt;ref name="careers" /&gt; several doctoral training programs in systems biology have been established in many parts of the world. In that same year, the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) put forward a grand challenge for systems biology in the 21st century to build a mathematical model of the whole cell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gilbert S. |last=Omenn |date=December 2006 |title=Grand Challenges and Great Opportunities in Science, Technology, and Public Policy |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=314 |issue=5806 |pages=1696–1704 |doi=10.1126/science.1135003 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/314/5806/1696.full }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the first whole-cell model of Mycoplasma Genitalium was achieved by the Karr Laboratory at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. The whole-cell model is able to predict viability of M. Genitalium cells in response to genetic mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Karr|first1=Jonathan R.|last2=Sanghvi|first2=Jayodita C.|last3=Macklin|first3=Derek N.|last4=Gutschow|first4=Miriam V.|last5=Jacobs|first5=Jared M.|last6=Bolival|first6=Benjamin|last7=Assad-Garcia|first7=Nacyra|last8=Glass|first8=John I.|last9=Covert|first9=Markus W.|title=A Whole-Cell Computational Model Predicts Phenotype from Genotype|journal=Cell|date=July 2012|volume=150|issue=2|pages=389–401|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.044|pmid=22817898|pmc=3413483}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important milestone in the development of systems biology has become the international project [[Physiome]].

According to the interpretation of Systems Biology as the ability to obtain, integrate and analyze complex data sets from multiple experimental sources using interdisciplinary tools, some typical technology platforms are:
* [[Phenomics]]
: Organismal variation in [[phenotype]] as it changes during its life span.
* [[Genomics]]
: Organismal [[deoxyribonucleic acid]] (DNA) sequence, including intra-organisamal cell specific variation. (i.e., [[telomere]] length variation)
* [[Epigenomics]] / [[Epigenetics]]
: Organismal and corresponding cell specific transcriptomic regulating factors not empirically coded in the genomic sequence. (i.e., [[DNA methylation]], [[Histone acetylation and deacetylation]], etc.).
* [[Transcriptomics]]
: Organismal, tissue or whole cell [[gene expression]] measurements by [[DNA microarray]]s or [[serial analysis of gene expression]]
* [[Interferomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell-level transcript correcting factors (i.e., [[RNA interference]])
* [[Proteomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of proteins and peptides via [[two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]], [[mass spectrometry]] or multi-dimensional protein identification techniques (advanced [[High-performance liquid chromatography|HPLC]] systems coupled with [[mass spectrometry]]). Sub disciplines include [[phosphoproteomics]], [[glycoproteomics]] and other methods to detect chemically modified proteins.
* [[Metabolomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell-level measurements of small molecules known as [[metabolites]]
* [[Glycomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell-level measurements of [[carbohydrate]]s
* [[Lipidomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell level measurements of [[lipids]].
In addition to the identification and quantification of the above given molecules further techniques analyze the dynamics and interactions within a cell. This includes:{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}
* [[Interactomics]]
: Organismal, tissue, or cell level study of interactions between molecules. Currently, the authoritative molecular discipline in this field of study is [[protein-protein interaction]]s (PPI), although the working definition does not preclude inclusion of other molecular disciplines such as those defined here.

* [[Physiomics]]
: A systematic study of [[physiome]] in biology.

[[Cancer systems biology]] is an example of the systems biology approach, which can be distinguished by the specific object of study ([[tumorigenesis]] and [[Cancer treatment|treatment of cancer]]). It works with the specific data  (patient samples, high-throughput data with particular attention to characterizing [[Cancer genome sequencing|cancer genome]] in patient tumour samples) and tools (immortalized cancer [[cell lines]], [[Animal testing on rodents|mouse models]] of tumorigenesis, [[xenograft]] models, [[high-throughput sequencing]] methods, siRNA-based gene knocking down [[high-throughput screening]]s, computational modeling of the consequences of somatic [[mutations]] and [[genome instability]]).&lt;ref name="barillot13"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Barillot | first1 =Emmanuel  | last2 = Calzone | first2 = Laurence | last3 = Hupe | first3 = Philippe | last4 = Vert | first4 =

Significant efforts in computational systems biology of cancer have been made in creating realistic multi-scale ''[[in silico]]'' models of various tumours.&lt;ref name="byrne2010"&gt;

The investigations are frequently combined with large-scale perturbation methods, including gene-based ([[RNAi]], mis-expression of [[wild type]] and mutant genes) and chemical approaches using small molecule libraries.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} [[Robot]]s and automated sensors enable such large-scale experimentation and data acquisition. These technologies are still emerging and many face problems that the larger the quantity of data produced, the lower the quality.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A wide variety of quantitative scientists ([[computational biology|computational biologists]], [[statistician]]s, [[mathematician]]s, [[computer scientist]]s and [[physicist]]s) are working to improve the quality of these approaches and to create, refine, and retest the models to accurately reflect observations.

The systems biology approach often involves the development of [[Mechanism (biology)|mechanistic]] models, such as the reconstruction of [[dynamic system]]s from the quantitative properties of their elementary building blocks.&lt;ref name="dibernardo03" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dibernardo05" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dynamicmodel" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korkut|first1=A|last2=Wang|first2=W|last3=Demir|first3=E|last4=Aksoy|first4=BA|last5=Jing|first5=X|last6=Molinelli|first6=EJ|last7=Babur|first7=Ö|last8=Bemis|first8=DL|last9=Onur Sumer|first9=S|last10=Solit|first10=DB|last11=Pratilas|first11=CA|last12=Sander|first12=C|title=Perturbation biology nominates upstream-downstream drug combinations in RAF inhibitor resistant melanoma cells.|journal=eLife|date=18 August 2015|volume=4|pmid=26284497|doi=10.7554/eLife.04640|pmc=4539601}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, a cellular network can be modelled mathematically using methods coming from [[chemical kinetics]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gupta|first=Ankur|last2=Rawlings|first2=James B.|date=2014-4|title=Comparison of Parameter Estimation Methods in Stochastic Chemical Kinetic Models: Examples in Systems Biology|journal=AIChE Journal|volume=60|issue=4|pages=1253–1268|doi=10.1002/aic.14409|issn=0001-1541|pmc=4946376|pmid=27429455}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[control theory]]. Due to the large number of parameters, variables and constraints in cellular networks, numerical and computational techniques are often used (e.g., [[flux balance analysis]]).&lt;ref name=dynamicmodel&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tavassoly|first1=Iman|title=Dynamics of Cell Fate Decision Mediated by the Interplay of Autophagy and Apoptosis in Cancer Cells|date=2015|publisher=Springer International Publishing|isbn=978-3-319-14961-5|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-14962-2|series=Springer Theses}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Other aspects of computer science, [[informatics]], and statistics are also used in systems biology. These include:
* New forms of computational models, such as the use of [[process calculi]] to model biological processes (notable approaches include stochastic [[π-calculus]], BioAmbients, Beta Binders, BioPEPA, and Brane calculus) and [[constraint programming|constraint]]-based modeling.
* Integration of information from the literature, using techniques of [[information extraction]] and [[text mining]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ananadou | first1 = Sophia | author1-link = Sophia Ananiadou | last2 = Kell | first2 = Douglas | last3 = Tsujii | first3 = Jun-ichi | title = Text mining and its potential applications in systems biology | journal = Trends in Biotechnology | volume = 24 | issue = 12 | pages = 571–579 | date = December 2006 | doi = 10.1016/j.tibtech.2006.10.002 | pmid = 17045684 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Takht-i-rustam or '''Takht-e Rostam''' or '''Stupa of Takht-e Rostam'''&lt;ref&gt;Atlas Obscura, https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam&lt;/ref&gt;is a [[stupa]]-[[monastery]] complex 2 km south of the town of [[Haibak]]. Built in the 4-5th century AD while the area was part of the [[Kushano-Sasanian Kingdom]] the complex is carved entirely from the bedrock and "consists of five chambers, two of them sanctuaries. One of them has a domed ceiling with an elaborate lotus leaf decoration. On an adjacent hill is the stupa, surmounted by a harmika, with several more rough caves around the base. A hoard of Ghaznavid coins was found by chance in one of the caves."&lt;ref&gt;mapping Buddhist monestaries, http://monastic-asia.wikidot.com/takht-i-rustam&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Following the [[Muslim conquests of Afghanistan]] the original purpose of the monastery was lost. Instead the site was incorporated into [[Persian mythology]] in the story of [[Rostam and Sohrab]] which forms part of the 10th-century Persian epic [[Shahnameh]] by the [[Persian literature|Persian poet]] [[Ferdowsi]]. In the story it is said that [[Rostam]] supposedly traveled to the Kingdom of [[Samangan]] and stayed with the king at Takht-i-rustam.&lt;ref&gt;Atlas Obscura, https://www.atlasobscura.com/places/stupa-takhte-rostam&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Context Group''' is a working group of international [[Bible|biblical]] scholars who promote research into the Bible using [[Social sciences|social-scientific]] methods such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]].

==Founding==

The Context Group is an international team of scholars that merges historical [[exegesis]] and the social sciences to [[Hermeneutics|interpret the Bible]] in its social and cultural contexts. It initially organized in 1986 as the "Social Facets Seminar," headed by John H. Elliott as Chair, meeting in conjunction with [[The Jesus Seminar]] under the direction of Robert W. Funk and the Westar Institute. In 1989 it broke ties with the Jesus Seminar and reorganized in Portland, Oregon, as The Context Group, A Project on the Bible in its Social and Cultural Environment.

Two seminal publications by founding members were [[Bruce J. Malina]]'s ''The New Testament World: Insights from Cultural Anthropology'' (1981) and [[John H. Elliott]]'s ''Home for the Homeless: A Sociological Exegesis of 1 Peter'' (1981). Elliott's ''What is Social-Scientific Criticism of the Bible?'' (1993) coined a new term for the group's methodology and provided a bibliographic survey. Other key figures who published on the subject during this era (all of whom eventually became part of the Context Group) include Dennis Duling, Philip Esler, Douglas E. Oakman, Jerome Neyrey SJ, John J. Pilch, Richard L. Rohrbaugh, and Wolfgang Stegemann.

The work of the group has had considerable influence in the field, but also has attracted a variety of criticisms.

==Main ideas==

At the root of the Context Group's social-scientific method is the belief that biblical scholars have taken [[Western culture|western]] [[culture|cultural]] assumptions for granted when interpreting the Bible, an ancient document produced in a much different culture.

The key difference is that the modern western world is an [[individualism|individualistic]], [[industrialism|industrial]] society, whereas the society of the ancient [[Mediterranean]] world was [[collectivism|collectivistic]] and [[Agrarian society|agrarian]].

The ancient Mediterranean was also a [[High context culture|high-context society]], where discourse took shared cultural values for granted. This contrasts with the modern western world, which is a low-context society in which discourse tends to be more specific and specialized (i.e. to particular groups, subcultures, etc.). According to the Context scholars, the interpreter must learn the cultural assumptions and values behind the text in order to understand it correctly. This involves understanding values such as [[honor]] and [[shame]], for example, which Malina calls "pivotal cultural values."

Other common themes in Context analysis of the Bible include patron-client relationships, the "[[evil eye]]", [[kinship]], [[Virtue|purity]] codes, and dyadic/group-oriented personalities.

==Context scholars and publications==
The Context Group’s founding and early members include important scholars in the field today: [[Bruce J. Malina]], [[Philip Esler]], [[Jerome H. Neyrey]] SJ, [[John J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2814">The '''First Law of Geography''', according to [[Waldo Tobler]], is "everything is related to everything else, but near things are more related than distant things."&lt;ref&gt;Tobler W., (1970) "A computer movie simulating urban growth in the Detroit region". ''Economic Geography'', 46(Supplement): 234-240.&lt;/ref&gt; This first law is the foundation of the fundamental concepts of [[spatial dependence]] and [[spatial autocorrelation]] and is utilized specifically for the [[inverse distance weighting]] method for [[spatial interpolation]] and to support the [[regionalized variable theory]] for [[kriging]].&lt;ref&gt;Kemp, Karen.  "Encyclopedia of Geographic Information Science", SAGE, 2008, p146-147&lt;/ref&gt;

Tobler first presented his seminal idea during a meeting of the [[International Geographical Union]]'s Commission on Qualitative Methods held in 1969 and later published by him in 1970. Though simple in its presentation, this idea is profound. Without it, "the full range of conditions anywhere on the Earth's surface could in principle be found packed within any small area. There would be no regions of approximately homogeneous conditions to be described by giving attributes to area objects. Topographic surfaces would vary chaotically, with slopes that were everywhere infinite, and the contours of such surfaces would be infinitely dense and contorted. Spatial analysis, and indeed life itself, would be impossible."&lt;ref&gt;De Smith, Michael John; Goodchild, Michael F.; Longley, Paul. "Geospatial Analysis: A Comprehensive Guide to Principles, Techniques and Software Tools", Troubador Publishing Ltd, 2007, p44&lt;/ref&gt;

Less well known is his second law, which complements the first: "The phenomenon external to an area of interest affects what goes on inside".&lt;ref&gt;Linear pycnophylactic reallocation—Comment on a paper by D. Martin, ''International Journal of Geographical Information Science'', 13(1), 85-90, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation and background==
The theory is based upon the concept of the [[friction of distance]] "where distance itself hinders interaction between places. The farther two places are apart, the greater the hindrance",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Meredith; Alagona, Peter S. "AP Human Geography 2008", Barron's Educational Series, 91-92, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; or cost. For example, one is less likely to travel across town to purchase a sandwich than walk to the corner store for the same sandwich. In this example hindrance, or cost, can readily be counted in time and transportation costs which are added to the price of the purchase and thus result in high levels of friction. The friction of distance and the increase in cost combine causing the [[distance decay]] effect.

UBC iSchool (Library, Archival and Information Studies) is a graduate school at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]] offering a Master of Archival Studies (MAS), a Master of Arts in Children's Literature (MACL), a Master of Library and Information Studies (MLIS), a DUAL Master of Archival Studies/Master of Library and Information Studies (MASLIS) and a Doctor of Philosophy in Library, Archival and Information Studies (Ph.D.). Founded in 1961 as the School of Librarianship, the iSchool is currently located in the Irving K. Barber Learning Centre. The school changed its name in 2018, but was previously known as the '''School of Library, Archival and Information Studies''' ('''SLAIS''' or '''SLAIS, The [[Information school|iSchool]] at UBC''').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://slais.ubc.ca/2018/06/ubc-ischool-has-a-new-name/ |title="UBC iSchool has a new name." |date=June 2018 |access-date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
UBC iSchool is an internationally ranked, multi-disciplinary school, ranked first in Canada, and fourth in the world for graduate education in library and information management.&lt;ref&gt;QS Rankings. https://slais.ubc.ca/2018/08/ubcs-ischool-ranked-number-one-in-canada-for-library-and-information-studies/. "UBC’s iSchool ranked number one in Canada for library and information studies, and fourth in the world." Accessed August 14, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;


==Academic Programs==
UBC iSchool offers four master's degrees and a doctoral degree. Students can also specialize in the First Nations Curriculum Concentration if they want to work with, or within Indigenous knowledge organizations. &lt;ref&gt;UBC iSchool. "First Nations Curriculum Concentration." https://slais.ubc.ca/programs/specializations/fncc/. Accessed August 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Archival Studies''' and '''Master of Library and Information Studies''' degrees are 48-credit programs, consisting primarily of coursework, with an optional 12-credit thesis option.

The '''Master of Archival Studies''' degree program follows the guidelines for archival education published by the Association of Canadian Archivists and the Society of American Archivists. The degree program began in 1981 and was the first stand-alone degree program in [[archival science]] in Canada or the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Eastwood, Terry. "Archival Research: the University of British Columbia Experience." ''The American Archivist'' 63 (Fall/Winter 2006): 243-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Master of Library and Information Studies''' degree is accredited by the American Library Association. The degree was first offered in 1995 and superseded the Master of Library Studies, which had been offered since 1971. Prior to that, the school offered a one-year [[Bachelor of Library Science]].&lt;ref&gt;About UBC iSchool. https://slais.ubc.ca/about/about-the-ischool/highlights/ "Highlights."] Accessed August 14, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dual Master of Archival Studies/Master of Library and Information Studies''' program enables students to earn both the MAS and MLIS degrees within three to five years, following the completion of 81 credits.

The '''Master of Arts in Children's Literature''' is a 30-credit interdisciplinary program, composed of courses from the departments of English, French, Language and Literacy Education, Theatre and SLAIS.

The '''Doctor of Philosophy in Library, Archival and Information Studies''' program was introduced in 2003, with Archival Studies and Library and Information Studies streams.

==Research==
Research is clustered in three core areas: management and preservation of digital records, creation and use of cultural materials, and digital information systems and information interaction. The International Research on Permanent Authentic Records in Electronic Systems (InterPARES) Project focuses on the authenticity of born-digital records in records management programs and archives. The Centre for the Investigation of Financial Electronic Records (CiFER) studies issues relevant to the management of financial records, including risk management, security and e-discovery. The Digital Information Interaction Group (DiiG) brings together researchers and students engaged in the study of human interaction with digital information objects, collections of digital media, and digital information systems.

=== New Media ===
At the iSchool, a number of faculty do research in the [[new media]] space: Internet research, online social networks, e-learning, new media literacy, youth and new media, e-books, social media, open data and government, user engagement, social tagging, researchers on GRAND (Graphics, Animation and New Media), as well as faculty associated with the Faculty of Art’s Bachelor of Media Studies.

=== Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) ===
[[Human–computer interaction|HCI]] is necessarily an interdisciplinary field, engaging researchers who design, build, test, evaluate and examine the impact of new computer implementations for individual, group and community use across levels of skill, ability, and facility with technology. It addresses multiple contexts from work to learning and includes both fixed and mobile technologies and applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://hci.ubc.ca/about-hciubc/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cultural Heritage ===
Collection, preservation, access and use in library, archival and museum contexts, as augmented and challenged by [[digitization]], digital production (‘born digital’ materials), participatory culture, and access through contemporary media. [[Cultural heritage management|Cultural Heritage Management]] addresses what in the cultural realm will be retained, by whom, in what manner, and with what access (i.e. whose history will be digitized, retained and made available). Research addresses both traditional and newly emerging contexts. It includes new access protocols and technologies for physical and digitized cultural artifacts held in traditional institutions, documentation, preservation, and sustainability of cultural knowledge and practices. For example, professors and students from the iSchool at UBC work with the [[Irving K. Barber Learning Centre]] and others to support the [http://www.indigitization.ca Indigitization] program, which provides funding and training for Indigenous communities and organizations to digitize cultural heritage materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://slais.ubc.ca/research/current-research-projects/|title=Current Research Projects {{!}} SLAIS, the iSchool @ UBC|website=slais.ubc.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indigitization.ca/|title=Indigitization {{!}} Toolkit for the Digitization of First Nations Knowledge|website=www.indigitization.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Records and Information Management ===
[[Archival science]] is concerned broadly with the creation and preservation of representations of transactions (i.e., [[Records management|records]] and [[Archive|archives]]) that can provide information and evidence about past activities of individuals and organizations. Archival Science explores the theoretical and practical conditions that lead to, or work against, creation and preservation of persistent and trustworthy records and archives. It also touches on issues of representation, openness, transparency, privacy, security, accountability, internal control, compliance and risk and risk management.

=== Children and Young Adult Literature and Services ===
This research depends on a multi-disciplinary approach bringing an understanding of child development, cognition, literacy, and literary analysis to bear on creative and critical evaluation of [[children's literature]] and [[young adult literature]] in traditional and new media formats.&lt;ref&gt;http://macl.arts.ubc.ca/&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''School of Mathematics and Statistics''' is a constituent body of the [[Sydney Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]] at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was established in its present form in 1991.

As of December 2010, the Head of School is Professor Neville Weber and the Deputy Head of School is Associate Professor David Easdown.&lt;ref name="about_school"&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Magma computer algebra system]] is produced and distributed by the Computational Algebra Group within the School.

==History==
Mathematics has been taught at the University since its establishment. The first Professor of Mathematics was [[Morris Birkbeck Pell|Morris Pell]], one of the University's three foundation professors. Pell gave the first lecture in mathematics on 13 October 1852, two days after the University's inauguration, to all 24 students at the time. At least two years of mathematics were still required of all the University's students at the time of Pell's retirement in 1877.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School of Mathematics and Statistics was established on 1 January 1991 with the merging of the departments of Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, and Mathematical Statistics.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School is located in the Carslaw Building, which was completed in the early 1960s, and is named after mathematician [[Horatio Scott Carslaw|Horatio Carslaw]] (1870-1954), who was once Professor of Mathematics at the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/Carslaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''World Agroforestry Centre''' (a brand name used by the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry, ICRAF), is an international [[institute]] headquartered in [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], and founded in 1978 as "International Council for Research in Agroforestry".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Oh6wJUiOdSQC&amp;pg=PT1&amp;lpg=PT1&amp;dq=World+Agroforestry+Centre+ICRAF+founded+in+1978&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KUgToJT_z5&amp;sig=63OnYCdx2oFbvPKkYEUcQPIrn8g&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj6sq6nrKzYAhXGtRQKHTQwAokQ6AEIWDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=World%20Agroforestry%20Centre%20ICRAF%20founded%20in%201978&amp;f=false|title=World Agroforestry Centre annual report 2005: Agroforestry science to support the millennium development goals|last=|first=|date=2005|publisher=World Agroforestry Centre|year=|isbn=9789290591993|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre specializes in the [[sustainable management]], [[Environmental protection|protection]] and [[regulation]] of [[tropical rainforest]] and natural reserves. It is one of 15 agricultural research centres which makes up the global network known as the [[CGIAR]].

== About ==

The Centre conducts research in [[agroforestry]], in partnership with national agricultural research systems with a view to developing more sustainable and productive land use. The focus of its research is countries/regions in the developing world, particular in the tropics of Central and [[South America]], [[Southeast Asia]], South Asia, West Africa, Eastern Africa and parts of central [[Africa]]. 
In 2002, the Centre acquired the World Agroforestry Centre brand name, although '''International Centre for Research in Agroforestry''' remains its legal name and it continues to use the acronym '''ICRAF'''.

In 2017, ICRAF released a study at the UN Climate Change Conference that centers on Agroforestry and the emission of carbons from deforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/following-cop-23-decision-on-agriculture-the-role-of-agroforestry-and-a-glance-at-perus-climate-plans/|title=Guest Article: Following COP 23 Decision on Agriculture: The Role of Agroforestry and a Glance at Peru’s Climate Plans {{!}} SDG Knowledge Hub {{!}} IISD|last=Hub|first=IISD's SDG Knowledge|access-date=2017-12-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World Game''', sometimes called the '''World Peace Game''', is an educational simulation developed by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in 1961 to help create solutions to [[overpopulation]] and the uneven distribution of global resources. This alternative to [[Wargaming|war games]] uses Fuller's [[Dymaxion map]] and requires a group of players to cooperatively solve a set of metaphorical scenarios, thus challenging the dominant nation-state perspective with a more holistic "total world" view. The idea was to "make the world work for 100% of humanity in the shortest possible time through spontaneous cooperation without ecological damage or disadvantage to anyone,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Game|url=http://bfi.org/about-bucky/buckys-big-ideas/world-game|publisher=Buckminster Fuller Institute|accessdate=19 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus increasing the [[quality of life]] for all people.

==History and use==
Fuller first publicly proposed the concept as the [[core curriculum]] at the (then new) [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]]. He proposed it again in 1964 for the 1967 [[Expo 67|International and Universal Exposition]] in [[Montreal]], Quebec, Canada.

In a preamble to World Game documents released in 1970, Fuller identified it very closely with his 'Guinea Pig 'B' experiment' and his 'Comprehensive Anticipatory Design Science' lifework. He claimed intellectual property rights as well to control what he considered to be misapplication of his idea by others. He also claimed he had been playing it 'longhand' without the assistance of computers since 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bfi.org/about-bucky/buckys-big-ideas/world-game World Game article at the Buckminster Fuller Institute Website]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1972, the World Game Institute was founded in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]] by Fuller, [[Medard Gabel]], [[Howard J. Brown (businessman)|Howard J. Brown]] and others.

In 1980, the World Game Institute and the World Resources Inventory published the World Energy Data Sheet.  The World Energy Data Sheet compiled a nation by nation summary of energy production, resources, and consumption. The information was compiled in tables and map formats. The project was researched by Seth Snyder and overseen by Medard Gabel.  The work was used during a World Game (Philadelphia, summer 1980).

By 1993, the World Game Institute developed and sold an educational software package called Global Recall, which contained global data, maps, an encyclopedia of world problems, and tools for developing solutions to world problems.  The package was a computer-based simulation game intended for use by high school and college students in learning about world problems and how to solve them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitez|first=Michael|title=Software Provides Opportunity To Think Globally The World Game Institute Has Put Its Ideas On Computer Disk|url=http://articles.philly.com/1993-05-20/news/25966386_1_world-game-global-citizens-software|publisher=The Philadelphia Inquirer|accessdate=19 January 2014|date=May 20, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a for-profit educational company named o.s. Earth, Inc. purchased the principal assets of the World Game Institute and has been offering a Global Simulation Workshop that is a 'direct descendant of Buckminster Fuller's famous World Game.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osearth.com/ o.s.Earth Inc.]&lt;/ref&gt;
