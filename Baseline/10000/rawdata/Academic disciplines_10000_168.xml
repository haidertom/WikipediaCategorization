'''Algorithmic composition''' is the technique of using [[algorithm]]s to create [[music]].

Algorithms (or, at the very least, formal sets of rules) have been used to [[composer|compose]] music for centuries; the procedures used to plot [[Voice leading|voice-leading]] in Western [[counterpoint]], for example, can often be reduced to algorithmic determinacy.  The term is usually reserved, however, for the use of formal procedures to make music without human intervention, either through the introduction of [[Randomness|chance]] procedures or the use of [[computers]].

Some algorithms or data that have no immediate musical relevance are used by composers&lt;ref name="Music Algorithm Composition Inspiration"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Bruce L.|title=Algorithmic Composition as a Model of Creativity|journal=Organised Sound|date=December 1996|volume=1|issue=3|pages=157–165|doi=10.1017/S1355771896000222|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=50017|accessdate=3 January 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; as creative inspiration for their music.  Algorithms such as [[fractals]], [[L-system]]s, [[statistics|statistical models]], and even arbitrary [[data]] (e.g. [[census]] figures, [[Geographic information system|GIS]] coordinates, or [[magnetic field]] measurements) have been used as source materials.

==Models for algorithmic composition==
Compositional algorithms are usually classified by the specific programming techniques they use. The results of the process can then be divided into 1) music composed by computer and 2) music composed with the aid of computer. Music may be considered composed by computer when the algorithm is able to make choices of its own during the creation process.

Another way to sort compositional algorithms is to examine the results of their compositional processes. Algorithms can either 1) provide notational information ([[sheet music]] or [[MIDI]]) for other instruments or 2) provide an independent way of [[sound synthesis]] (playing the composition by itself). There are also algorithms creating both notational data and sound synthesis.

One way to categorize compositional algorithms is by their structure and the way of processing data, as seen in this model of six partly overlapping types:&lt;ref name="Papadopoulos and Wiggins"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc.gold.ac.uk/~mas02gw/papers/AISB99b.pdf |title=AI Methods for Algorithmic Composition: A Survey, a Critical View and Future Prospects |year=1999 |last1=Papadopoulos |first1=George |last2=Wiggins |first2=Geraint |journal=Proceedings from the AISB’99 Symposium on Musical Creativity, Edinburgh, Scotland |pages=110–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Translational Models===
This is an approach to music synthesis that involves "translating" information from an existing non-musical medium into a new sound. The translation can be either rule-based or [[stochastic]].  For example, when translating a picture into sound, a [[jpeg]] image of a horizontal line may be interpreted in sound as a constant pitch, while an upwards-slanted line may be an ascending scale. Oftentimes, the software seeks to extract concepts or metaphors from the medium, (such as height or sentiment) and apply the extracted information to generate songs using the ways music theory typically represents those concepts. Another example is the translation of text into music,&lt;ref name="TransProse: Generating Music From Text" &gt;{{cite journal | last=Davis|first=Hannah| title= Generating Music from Literature| journal= Proceedings of the EACL Workshop on Computational Linguistics for Literature| year =2014|  url =https://arxiv.org/abs/1403.2124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Generating Music From Text" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.musicfromtext.com/ |title=Generating Music from Text }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can approach composition by extracting sentiment (positive or negative) from the text using [[machine learning]] methods like [[sentiment analysis]] and represents that sentiment in terms of chord quality such as minor (sad) or major (happy) chords in the musical output generated.&lt;ref name="Tambr: Generating Music From Text" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://tambr.ml |title=Tambr Music From Literature }}{{dead link|date=August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mathematical models===
Mathematical models are based on mathematical [[equations]] and random events. The most common way to create compositions through mathematics is [[stochastic processes]]. In stochastic models a piece of music is composed as a result of non-[[deterministic]] methods. The compositional process is only partially controlled by the composer by weighting the possibilities of random events. Prominent examples of stochastic algorithms are [[Markov chains]] and various uses of [[Gaussian distributions]]. Stochastic algorithms are often used together with other algorithms in various decision-making processes.

Music has also been composed through natural phenomena. These chaotic models create compositions from the [[harmonic]] and inharmonic phenomena of nature. For example, since the 1970s [[fractals]] have been studied also as models for algorithmic composition.

As an example of deterministic compositions through mathematical models, the [[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] provides an option to play an [[integer sequence]] as [[12-tone equal temperament]] music.  (It is initially set to convert each integer to a note on an 88-key [[musical keyboard]] by computing the integer [[Modulo operation|modulo]] 88, at a steady rhythm. Thus 123456, the natural numbers, equals half of a chromatic scale.) As another example, the all-interval series has been used for computer-aided composition &lt;ref&gt;Mauricio Toro, Carlos Agon, Camilo Rueda, Gerard Assayag. "[http://www.jatit.org/volumes/Vol86No2/17Vol86No2.pdf GELISP: A FRAMEWORK TO REPRESENT MUSICAL CONSTRAINT SATISFACTION PROBLEMS AND SEARCH STRATEGIES]." Journal of Theoretical and Applied Information Technology 86 (2). 2016. 327-331.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Knowledge-based systems===
One way to create compositions is to isolate the aesthetic code of a certain musical genre and use this code to create new similar compositions. [[Knowledge-based systems]] are based on a pre-made set of arguments that can be used to compose new works of the same style or genre. Usually this is accomplished by a set of tests or rules requiring fulfillment for the composition to be complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Brown |first=Silas |date=1997 |title=Algorithmic Composition and Reductionist Analysis: Can a Machine Compose? |url=http://people.ds.cam.ac.uk/ssb22/clara/article.htm |magazine= CamNotes |publisher=Cambridge University New Music Society |access-date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Grammars===
Music can also be examined as a language with a distinctive [[grammar]] set. Compositions are created by first constructing a musical grammar, which is then used to create comprehensible musical pieces. Grammars often include rules for macro-level composing, for instance [[harmonies]] and [[rhythm]], rather than single notes.

===Evolutionary methods===
[[Evolutionary music|Evolutionary methods of composing music]] are based on [[genetic algorithms]].&lt;ref&gt;Charles Fox 2006 [https://www.aaai.org/Papers/FLAIRS/2006/Flairs06-047.pdf Genetic Hierarchical Music Structures] (American Association for Artificial Intelligence)&lt;/ref&gt; The composition is being built by the means of [[evolutionary]] process. Through [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]], different solutions evolve towards a suitable musical piece. Iterative action of the algorithm cuts out bad solutions and creates new ones from those surviving the process. The results of the process are supervised by the critic, a vital part of the algorithm controlling the quality of created compositions.

===Evo-Devo approach===
[[evolutionary algorithm|Evolutionary]] methods, combined with developmental processes, constitute the ''evo-devo'' approach for generation and optimization of complex structures. These methods have also been applied to music composition, where the musical structure is obtained by an iterative process that transform a very simple composition (made of a few notes) into a complex fully-fledged piece (be it a score, or a MIDI file).&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ball|first=Philip| title= Algorithmic Rapture| journal= Nature| volume= 188| year =2012| pages= 456| url =http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/488458a | doi = 10.1038/488458a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AI survey"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fernandez|first=JD|last2=Vico|first2=F|title=AI Methods in Algorithmic Composition: A Comprehensive Survey.|journal=Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|date=2013|volume=48|pages=513–582|doi=10.1613/jair.3908|url=http://www.jair.org/media/3908/live-3908-7454-jair.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systems that learn===
{{further|Machine improvisation|Machine listening|Machine learning}}
Learning systems are programs that have no given knowledge of the genre of music they are working with. Instead, they collect the learning material by themselves from the example material supplied by the user or programmer. The material is then processed into a piece of music similar to the example material. This method of algorithmic composition is strongly linked to algorithmic modeling of style,&lt;ref&gt;S. Dubnov, G. Assayag, O. Lartillot, G. Bejerano, "[http://cms2.unige.ch/fapse/neuroemo/pdf/JournalDubnov.pdf Using Machine-Learning Methods for Musical Style Modeling]", IEEE Computers, 36 (10), pp. 73-80, Oct. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[machine improvisation]], and such studies as [[cognitive science]] and the study of [[neural networks]]. Assayag and Dubnov &lt;ref&gt;G. Assayag, S. Dubnov, O. Delerue, "[http://articles.ircam.fr/textes/Assayag99a/index.pdf Guessing the Composer's Mind : Applying Universal Prediction to Musical Style]", In Proceedings of International Computer Music Conference, Beijing, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a variable length [[Markov model]] to learn motif and phrase continuations of different length. Marchini and Purwins &lt;ref name="Marchini"&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-23126-1_14 |title=Unsupervised Analysis and Generation of Audio Percussion Sequences |year=2011 |last1=Marchini |first1=Marco |last2=Purwins |first2=Hendrik |booktitle=Exploring Music Contents |pages=205–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented a system that learns the structure of an audio recording of a rhythmical percussion fragment using unsupervised clustering and variable length Markov chains and that synthesizes musical variations from it.

===Hybrid systems===
Programs based on a single algorithmic model rarely succeed in creating aesthetically satisfying results. For that reason algorithms of different type are often used together to combine the strengths and diminish the weaknesses of these algorithms. Creating hybrid systems for music composition has opened up the field of algorithmic composition and created also many brand new ways to construct compositions algorithmically.  The only major problem with hybrid systems is their growing complexity and the need of resources to combine and test these algorithms.

==History==
In the mid-19th century, English literature in the United States was generally seen, within academia, as inferior to [[classical literature]] and its study generally limited to [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shumway|first1=David|title=Creating American Civilization: A Genealogy of American Literature as an Academic Discipline|date=1994|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=0816621888|pages=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gradual legitimization of the English language within American academia was accompanied by the introduction of a limited number of university courses devoted to the study of American literature. The first university-level course in the subject was introduced at [[Princeton University]] in 1872 by [[John Seely Hart]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=H. Lark|title=V. L. Parrington: Through the Avenue of Art|date=2011|publisher=Transaction|isbn=1412842182|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I-ZDFKJ_ARAC|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1880s, several universities offered undergraduate classes in American Literature, including [[Dartmouth College]], [[Mount Holyoke College]], the [[University of Notre Dame]], and the [[University of Iowa]].&lt;ref name=CUP/&gt; The first graduate-level course in American literature was taught at the [[University of Virginia]] in 1891.&lt;ref name=CUP&gt;{{cite book|last1=Renker|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Origins of American Literature Studies: An Institutional History|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521883458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, Dartmouth professor Charles Francis Richardson published a two-volume work on ''American Literature, 1607-1885'', credited as the first attempt at a comprehensive history of American literature. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Spengemann|first1=William|title=The Study of American Literature: A View from the Hill|url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~library/Library_Bulletin/Nov1996/LB-N96-Spengemann.html?mswitch-redir=classic|website=dartmouth.edu|publisher=Dartmouth College|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surge of nationalist fervor that accompanied [[United States]] involvement in [[World War I]] helped grow the study of American literature inside the United States. This was followed by an increased interest in the field abroad. By 1932, an assistant professorship of American Literature had been established at a French university while a chair for the study of "American civilization" had been created at [[Berlin University]].&lt;ref name=CUP /&gt;

==Journals and associations==
The scholarly journal ''American Literature'' was first published in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Literature|url=https://www.dukeupress.edu/American-Literature/?viewby=journal|website=dukeupress|publisher=Duke University Press|accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the American Literature Association, a coalition of 110 affiliated societies mostly concerned with the work of a particular author (e.g. the [[Emily Dickinson International Society]] or the [[Thoreau Society]]), was organized.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanliteratureassociation.org/the-ala/about/|title=About|publisher=American Literature Association|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archibald Knox''' (9 April 1864 in Cronkbourne&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/people/artists/aknox.htm Archibald Knox 1864-1933&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Tromode]], [[Isle of Man]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walshbrothers.co.uk/Update/Archibald_Knox.htm About Archibald Knox&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512004339/http://www.walshbrothers.co.uk/Update/Archibald_Knox.htm |date=May 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; 22 February 1933 in [[Douglas, Isle of Man]]), was a Manx designer of Scottish descent.  He is best known as being [[Liberty (department store)|Liberty]]'s primary designer at the height of their success and influence upon UK and International design&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archibaldknoxsociety.com/page_112136.html Chronology: Archibald Knox 1864-1933]&lt;/ref&gt; (to the extent that in Italy, Art Nouveau was known as Stile Liberty). Knox's pioneering and prolific work bridged the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], [[Celtic Revival]], [[Art Nouveau]], and [[Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecultureconcept.com/circle/archibald-knox-liberty-of-london-and-modernism/ Archibald Knox, Liberty of London &amp; Modernism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manxnationalheritage.im/news/celtic-style-exhibition-celebrates-150th-anniversary-of-the-birth-of-archibald-knox/ Celtic Style exhibition celebrates 150th anniversary of the birth of Archibald Knox]&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox's hundreds of designs for Liberty made his style widely known,&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. Tilbrook, The Designs of Archibald Knox for Liberty &amp; Co., 2000, p. 113, no. 95&lt;/ref&gt; (though not his name, as Liberty kept their designers anonymous). Most of his work for Liberty was for the [[Tudric]] (pewter) and Cymric (precious metals) ranges. The gravestone of Liberty's founder, [[Arthur Lasenby Liberty]], was designed by Knox. 

His design talent covered a wide range of objects, ornamental and utilitarian, and included silver and [[pewter]] tea sets, jewellery, [[inkwell]]s, boxes, gravestones, watercolours, graphic designs, calligraphy, a house design, fonts and even [[bank cheques]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/art/artists/knox.xml?menu=artistlist Archibald Knox - Isle of Man Government Manx National Heritage:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302185333/http://www.gov.im/mnh/collections/art/artists/knox.xml?menu=artistlist |date=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Family background==

Knox's father, William Knox, was living in [[Kilbirnie]] when he married Ann Carmichael from [[Lismore, Scotland|Lismore Island]] in 1853. They had moved to the Isle Of Man in 1856 with their firstborn, Robert, where William "an exceptionally ingenious cabinet and machine-maker, joined Moore’s Tromode Works, makers of high quality herring nets and sailcloth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archibaldknoxsociety.com/page_112136.html Chronology: Archibald Knox 1864-1933&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; William's sister Margaret had been the first Knox to move to Man when she married a Manx fisherman, William Callister in 1856. William Knox later started his own firm "William Knox’s Engineering Works" and was joined in his enterprise by four of his sons - Archibald pursuing his own career in art. Besides running a successful steamboat and ferry business, the Knox family mechanised the local fishing fleet, were pioneers in industrial electric lighting on Man and introduced the first motor car to the island. Knox's engineering background may have influenced his design process in that his metalwork designs were produced in the style of ready-to-engineer blueprints.

Archibald, the Knoxs' 5th child (and 5th son), started his schooling at St Barnabas Elementary School, and then attended [[Douglas, Isle of Man|Douglas]] Grammar School. At the age of 16 in 1880 Knox enrolled at the newly-opened and innovative Douglas School of Art. The students there considered themselves 'venturesome modernists'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"&gt;Tilbrook, Adrian J, 'Knox, The Early Years' in Stephen A Martin, Archibald Knox,, 2001 &lt;/ref&gt; In 1889 Knox was awarded his Art Master's Certificate.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2001"/&gt; During his youth Knox developed a lifelong interest in [[Celtic art]], particularly the carved Celtic and Norse stone crosses on the Isle of Man which date from c.500AD to c.1200AD. In 1893 ''[[The Builder]]'' published Knox's article, 'Ancient Crosses in the Isle of Man'.&lt;ref&gt;Knox, Archibald 'Ancient Crosses in the Isle of Man' in 'The Builder' 30 September 1896 pp. 243-246. (Includes sketches of the designs on Manx Crosses)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

Knox starting teaching at Douglas School of Art in 1884, while still a student. In 1896 or 1897 Knox was working for / studying with the pioneering designer [[Christopher Dresser]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J Tilbrook, 'Influences and Designs', in Martin, S., 'Archibald Knox' (2001) p.58.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897 he started teaching at [[Redhill, Surrey|Redhill]] School of Art where his friend A. J. Collister was principal, leaving with him for the [[Kingston University|Kingston School of Art]] in 1899.&lt;ref name="isle-of-man1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isle-of-man.com/manxnotebook/people/artists/aknox.htm |title=Archibald Knox 1864-1933 |publisher=Isle-of-man.com |date=1933-02-22 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1897 Knox also began designing for the [[Silver Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Turner, 'Archibald Knox and the Silver Studio', in Martin, S., 'Archibald Knox' (2001) p.53 &lt;/ref&gt; Then, from 1900 to 1904 Knox returned to the Isle of Man, and produced over 400 designs directly for Liberty of London.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian J. Tilbrook, The Designs of Archibald Knox for Liberty &amp; Co., 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Then he returned to teach at [[Kingston University|Kingston Art School]] (and Wimbledon Art School 1906/7), again following his friend A. J. Collister.&lt;ref name="isle-of-man1"/&gt; 

Knox resigned from his post as Head of Design at Kingston School of Art in 1912 following criticism of his teaching. About twenty of his students also quit and set up the [[Knox Guild of Design and Crafts]]. Knox was the Master of the Guild and would return to Kingston to exhibit with them. In 1913 he spent a year in the United States, and on his return to Man acted as a censor of internees' letters during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knockaloe.org.uk/archibald-knox |title=Archibald Knox (1864-1933) &amp;#124; Knockaloe Virtual Museum and Archive |publisher=Knockaloe.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, after the War, he again took up teaching art at some of the Isle of Man's schools until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archibald-knox.com/ |title=Archibald Knox Biography - Infos - Art Market |publisher=Archibald-knox.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox also produced a variety of design work on the Island for publications, illuminations, and gravestones.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen A. Martin (Ed.), Archibald Knox, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox's great late work was an illuminated manuscript titled 'The Deer's Cry'.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Stephen A. Martin (Ed.), Archibald Knox, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Each page is a complex interlaced illumination of a line of the prayer known as 'The Deer's Cry' or '[[Saint Patrick's Breastplate]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youblisher.com/p/824262-The-Deer-s-Cry-by-Archibald-Knox/ |title=The Deer's Cry by Archibald Knox &amp;#124; PDF to Flipbook |publisher=Youblisher.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.magnoliabox.com/search?q=deer%27s+cry&amp;type=product |title=Deer's cry posters &amp;#124; Deer's cry prints |publisher=Magnoliabox.com |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style, imagery, and colouring of each page reflects the content of each line of the prayer.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iompost.com/our-news/press-releases/-isle-of-man-stamps-and-coins-celebrate-the-150th-anniversary-of-the-birth-of-archibald-knox-with-a-set-of-ten-stamps/ |title=Archibald Knox |publisher=IoM Post |date= |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design principles and teaching methods==

Knox told his students a large number of maxims that give an insight into his design principles. Perhaps the primary one was
“Aim at order, hope for beauty”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knox the Person |url=http://www.archibaldknoxforum.com/knox-the-person/ |title=Archibald Knox &amp;#124; Knox the Person |publisher=Archibaldknoxforum.com |date=2017-12-12 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knox wrote on the blackboard for new students, “Never be ordinary, better be nothing than that”. Another maxim was, “Art is in everything if we choose to put it there”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knox the Person |url=http://www.archibaldknoxforum.com/knox-the-person/ |title=Archibald Knox &amp;#124; Knox the Person |publisher=Archibaldknoxforum.com |date=2017-12-12 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1912 Knox wrote to a student “Don’t slacken in your work: work and think – think and work: that is the royal road: there is no other through the forest of art”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Knox the Person |url=http://www.archibaldknoxforum.com/knox-the-person/ |title=Archibald Knox &amp;#124; Knox the Person |publisher=Archibaldknoxforum.com |date=2017-12-12 |accessdate=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knox had an innovate method of teaching art: he collected a set of three thousand glass slides, of examples of design work, to show his students. While showing these he encouraged the students to consider the design principles involved in each, and whether the design met the functional requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary D.Wren 'New Light From Old Records - Archibald Knox's approach to his work', in Martin, S. (ed) (2001) 'Archibald Knox', Artmedia, London&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and commemoration==
[[File:The grave of Archibald Knox - geograph.org.uk - 92103.jpg|thumb|The grave of Archibald Knox in New Kirk Braddan cemetery]]
Knox died of heart failure in 1933 and was buried in [[Braddan]] Cemetery. His epitaph reads "Archibald Knox. Artist. A humble servant of God in the ministry of the beautiful".

Cadran Cottage, Ballanard Road in Douglas, remodelled c.1910 with design by Knox, was listed as a [[Isle of Man's Registered Buildings|Registered Building of the Isle of Man]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.im/media/632285/0500166regbldcadrancottage.pdf |title=Registered Building No. 166 / Cadran Cottage, Ballanard Road, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word Cadran means quadrant on a sundial.

The first international touring exhibition of Knox's work was in 1996-1998.&lt;ref&gt;Martin,S.(2001)'Archibald Knox' Artmedia, London&lt;/ref&gt;

The Archibald Knox Society was founded in 2006. The aim of the Society is the education of the public worldwide in relation to all matters concerning the legacy of Knox.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.connect2charity.im/archibald-knox-society ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; To this end the Society has given lectures, (including an international tour), published journals and helped to organise exhibitions.

To celebrate the 150th Anniversary of Knox's birth, the [[Isle of Man Post Office]] issued a set of 10 stamps featuring his designs, released in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.iompost.com/stamps-coins/collection/archibald-knox-celtic-style-celebrating-the-150th-anniversary-of-his-birth/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140322001905/https://www.iompost.com/stamps-coins/collection/archibald-knox-celtic-style-celebrating-the-150th-anniversary-of-his-birth/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 March 2014 |title=Archibald Knox Celtic Style Celebrating the 150th Anniversary of his Birth |publisher=[[Isle of Man Post Office]] |accessdate=21 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2014, an exhibition exploring the work of Knox and his Celtic contemporaries ("Celtic Style") was held at the House of Manannan, Peel, Isle of Man. A commemorative concert was held at Peel Cathedral featuring newly composed harp music and also including Manx Gaelic choir music. An exhibition of Knox's work was held at the 42nd [[Olympia Art &amp; Antiques Fairs|Olympia International Art &amp; Antiques Fair]] in London in 2014.

'''The Architects Act 1997''' (c. 22) is the consolidating [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] for the keeping and publishing of the statutory [[Register of Architects]] by the [[Architects Registration Board]]. It has the [[long title]]: ''An Act to consolidate the enactments relating to architects.'' It consolidated two Acts of the 1930s as later amended both by primary legislation and by Orders in Council implementing the EC directive on architects providing for the recognition of architects qualified in other EC states, and the changes which had been made by Part III&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/53/part/III/1996-10-01?timeline=true E+W+S+N.I. Architects]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0 Hansard]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Passage of the consolidating Bill==
The Architects Act 1997 consolidated the originating and amending Acts relating to the registration of architects, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects Acts]] 1931-1996 (section 125 of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]]).

The [[Bill (proposed law)|Bill]] was introduced to the [[House of Lords]] on 17 December 1996 by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[James Mackay, Baron Mackay of Clashfern|Lord Mackay of Clashfern]], and given its first reading.&lt;ref name="introduced"/&gt; It received its second reading without call for a debate on 20 January 1997&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970120/text/70120-03.htm#70120-03_head0|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 577, part 39, col 384|date=20 January 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was passed to the Joint Committee on Consolidation Bills. On 3 March 1997 it was read for a third time without debate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199697/ldhansrd/vo970303/text/70303-03.htm#70303-03_head3|title=House of Lords Hansard; vol 578, part 66, Col 1503|date=3 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and passed to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&amp;STEMMER=en&amp;WORDS=17%20mar%201997%20column%20696&amp;ALL=&amp;ANY=&amp;PHRASE=%2217%20Mar%201997%20:%20Column%20696%20%22&amp;CATEGORIES=&amp;SIMPLE=&amp;SPEAKER=&amp;COLOUR=red&amp;STYLE=s&amp;ANCHOR=70317-26_spnew0&amp;URL=/pa/cm199697/cmhansrd/vo970317/debtext/70317-26.htm#70317-26_spnew0|title=House of Commons Hansard; 17 March 1997 part 26, Col 695|date=17 March 1997|work=[[Hansard]]|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill was given [[Royal Assent]] on 19 March 1997 and came into force on 21 July 1997.

==Legislative continuity==
The legislative continuity from the originating Act of 1931 to the consolidating Act of 1997 is shown by paragraph 19(2)(a) of Schedule 2 in the 1997 Act:
: ''"the Council" means the Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom established under the 1931 Act, which was renamed as the Board by section 118(1) of the 1996 Act.''
The [[Architects Registration Board]] (ARB) has limited powers to make rules in the manner prescribed by the Architects Act 1997, but not the power to make regulations which had previously been ascribed to the registration body when it was constituted as the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK).

==Statutory purpose==
The Act embodied previous legislation consequent upon [[Directive (European Union)|EU directives]] concerning the mutual recognition of professional qualifications in the [[member states of the European Union]] and other [[European Economic Area|EEA]] States, and certain changes which had been made to the previous legislation after the publication of the [[Warne Report]] in 1993.

For the purpose of ascertaining the duties and functions which the Architects Registration Board is required to execute and perform under the Architects Act 1997, the constraints on the Board include the requirements judicially applicable in the name of [[administrative law]].

In May 2006 ministerial responsibility for the ARB was transferred from the ODPM to the DCLG ([[Department for Communities and Local Government]]).  The DCLG website shows that of "four categories" of "[[non-departmental public bodies]]" (NDPBs) the ARB was being classified (at the end of May 2007) as one of two "[[Statutory corporation|public corporations]]", the other one being the [[Audit Commission (United Kingdom)|Audit Commission]],&lt;ref&gt;not to be confused with the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)]]&lt;/ref&gt; a body of entirely different political and legislative origin, function and capacities, so that the two have practically nothing in common. The website there briefly described the ARB as:
: ''The independent statutory regulator of all UK registered architects which has a dual mandate to protect the consumer and to safeguard the reputation of architects''.
That appears to have been more a politically advised than a factual statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22|title=Architects Act|year=1997|work=Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=2008-12-29| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071116155827/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1997/1997022.htm| archivedate=November 16, 2007&lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that it lacks congruity with an ordinary or accurate reading of the legislation enacted by Parliament (see further information below "Accuracy of Government Information").

===Amendment in 2008 under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)]]===
[[Architects Act 1997 : amendment of June 2008 under the European Communities Act 1972|Amendments]] made in June 2008 by [[Statutory Instrument]] established rules for the recognition of professional qualifications enabling migrants from the [[European Economic Area]] or [[Switzerland]] to register as architects in the United Kingdom. It also set out provisions for facilitating temporary and occasional professional services cross-border.

==Changes: before and after July 1997==
The previous legislation had enabled and required the [[Register of Architects]] to be established, maintained and published; and for that purpose there had been a Council, called the [[Architects' Registration Council of the United Kingdom]] (ARCUK), which had been established as a body corporate by the originating Act, namely the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|Architects (Registration) Act, 1931]].

The changes embodied in the [[consolidating Act]] of 1997 had first been enacted in Part III of the [[Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996]].  The changes had been made on the basis of a government consultation document dated 19 July 1994 which the [[Secretary of State for the Environment|Department of the Environment]] had issued with the title "[[Reform of Architects Registration]]".  The consultation document had set out fourteen proposals for reform, stemming from a request from ARCUK to the Government in 1992 that the Architects Registration Acts should be reviewed; and stated that a report on the review which had been carried out had been published by HMSO in 1993.  The report had been made by Mr E J D Warne, CB, and is commonly known as "The [[Warne Report]]".

The legislation which followed carried the proposed purposes into effect only in part.  In the consultation document the purpose of the reformed body was stated to be: setting criteria for admission to the Register; preventing misuse of the title "[[architect]]"; and the discipline of unprofessional conduct, and the setting of fee levels.  To that end, fourteen proposals had been enumerated.  Some were later abandoned; and others substantially altered, whether in the Bill which was presented to Parliament or in its passage through Parliament, including:
* that the reformed Board would be given statutory authority to make regulations consistent with the provisions of the legislation governing architects registration;
* that the reformed Board would publicise a statement of the criteria for disciplinary offences; and
* that in disciplinary cases, there would be a range of non-monetary penalties, and hearings would be before a small statutory committee composed of both architects and non-architects, with a right to appeal to the full Board.

Proposals mentioned in the consultation document which were later enacted and are now operative were:
* that ARCUK would remain as a legal entity, but, with no impact on its role or status, the name would be changed to "[[Architects Registration Board]]" (ARB);
* that there should be an office of Registrar whose functions would be to maintain the Register and carry out the instructions of the Board;
* that the Board would be made up of 8 lay members appointed by the Government, and 7 architects elected by registered architects; and
* that the [[Board of Architectural Education]] would be abolished, by reason of it being an unwieldy body which would be unnecessary for fulfilling the functions of the reformed Registration Board.

The Table of Derivations, set out at the end of the Act after Schedule 3, by showing the changes which had been made by the 1996 Act to the originating Act of 1931 (as it had by then been amended by the 1938 Act and other legislation), distinguishes them from the provisions which were in the legislation before the 1996 Act, and so were operative in the time of ARCUK and have remained operative from 21 July 1997, when the reconstituting changes took effect.

===Professional Conduct Committee===
One of the changes made was replacing the Discipline Committee of ARCUK with a Professional Conduct Committee under Part III of the Act with statutory powers to inflict fines expressly on a par with criminal penalties. Under the Act, the committee was to be a body having persons who were not themselves members of the profession in the decisive majority and who would not necessarily have the appropriate skill and knowledge to be able to act competently and fairly in respect of hazarding an architect's professional reputation or livelihood; nor would members of the committee be acting under the judicial oath of a judge or a magistrate in a court of criminal or civil jurisdiction, or pursuant to the consensual jurisdiction of an arbitrator. As a safeguard of [[due process]] in accordance with the [[rule of law]] the statutory provisions for constituting the Professional Conduct Committee in Part II of Schedule 1 of the Act (and as later amended) reflect the usual practice for appointing a legally qualified chairman, with appropriate experience, who can be held to have a professional and judicial responsibility for protecting the basic right of any accused person, whose reputation and livelihood could be at stake, to a fair and unprejudiced hearing and trial.

'''Exoneration'''

Under the first section of Part III of the Act &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 13]&lt;/ref&gt; 
the Board is required to issue a code "laying down standards of professional conduct and practice expected of registered persons",&lt;ref&gt;for current code see ARB website page Architects Code: Standards of Conduct and Practice 2010 Version [http://www.arb.org.uk/professional_standards/regulating_architects/architects_code_2010/code.php]&lt;/ref&gt; but the same section  states explicitly that failure to comply with the provisions of the code shall not be taken of itself to constitute unacceptable professional conduct. In the case of an architect against whom an allegation of unacceptable professional conduct or serious professional incompetence has not been sustained by the Professional Conduct Committee the Act provides for publication of an exonerating statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1997/22/part/III section 15 (5)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
The Table of Derivations also shows that certain definitions which were inserted for the purpose of the consolidation included one to make clear that where there is a reference to "unacceptable professional conduct", it has the same meaning as it has in section 14 (not ''vice versa''): in section 14(1) the phrase is expanded as "conduct which falls short of the standard required of a registered person".

==Interpretation==

===Legislative context of Architects Registration===
Under the legislation, the registration body has been a statutory corporation from its inception, first as a Council of numerous persons nominated mainly by professional bodies under the 1931 Act, and, from July 1997, as a Board of fifteen persons, of which the majority has been appointed by the [[Privy Council]] in the manner prescribed by paragraph 3(1) of Schedule 1 of the Act, that is: 
: ''...after consultation with the Secretary of State and such other persons or bodies as the Privy Council thinks fit, to represent the interests of users of architectural services and the general public'',
Members of the general public clearly have an interest to the extent that the legislation makes it a criminal offence to infringe the restrictions placed upon the freedom of individuals (including qualified architects), and of firms and partnerships, and companies and corporations of all kinds, to use the word "architect".

From the 1880s, it has been a moot point whether the effect of such registration and protection of the title "architect" would be to place an undue burden on the profession for too little benefit for the public, or to confer an unfair advantage on the profession, or one section of it, as against competitors. But in more recent decades the statutory [[Register of Architects]] and the protection of the title "[[architect]]" under the legislation has been affected by the obligation of the Government to secure compliance with obligations in connection with membership of the [[European Union]] and the [[European Economic Area]]. This has brought in its train questions about the criteria and standards for deciding upon [[equivalence of professional qualifications]] in EU and EEA countries, and the legitimate expectations of those who have qualified.

===Accuracy of UK Government information about Architects Registration===
In May 2006 the then Prime Minister [[Tony Blair|(Mr Blair)]] arranged for ministerial responsibility for the Architects Registration Board to be transferred from the then [[Office of the Deputy Prime Minister]] (ODPM) to a newly formed Department which was to be called "[[Department of Communities and Local Government|Communities and Local Government]]" (DCLG) and to be headed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]] ([[Ruth Kelly]]), to whom the Prime Minister addressed [http://www.communities.gov.uk/archived/general-content/corporate/388681/prime-minister-letter a letter] setting out what was required.  This Department's [http://www.communities.gov.uk/ official website] published the Prime Minister's letter and stated its vision to be of "prosperous and cohesive communities, offering a safe, healthy and sustainable environment for all".

The website also had [http://www.communities.gov.uk/planningandbuilding/buildingregulations/architects/architectsregistration/ a page] for describing the [[Architects Registration Board]] where it offered a summary of the effect of the legislation, but which had a thread of inaccuracy in three out of four sentences, namely:
* stating that ARB "succeeded" ARCUK, when the legislation had expressly stated that it was the same body but with another name as from July 1997 (See above: Continuity of Legislation);
* stating that it was established to guarantee the professional competence of architects to consumers, when there is nothing in the legislation or otherwise giving ARB either the legal powers or the funds to honour any such guarantee; and
* that all architects must be registered by ARB in order to practise legally in the United Kingdom, when under the legislation (see related articles cited below) an architect, or any other person, is free to perform or supply the services of an architect subject only to the restrictions on the use of the vernacular word "[[architect]]" contained in the legislation first enacted by Parliament in the [[Architects (Registration) Acts, 1931 to 1938|1938 Act]].

'''Arthropodology''' (from Greek {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ἄρθρον|ἄρθρον]]}} - ''arthron'', "joint", and {{lang|el|[[:wikt:πούς|πούς]]}}, ''gen''.: {{lang|el|[[:wikt:ποδός|ποδός]]}} - ''pous'', ''podos'', "foot", which together mean "jointed feet") is a biological discipline concerned with the study of [[arthropod]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museumstuff.com/learn/topics/Arthropodology Etymology-Museum of Learning.&lt;/ref&gt; a phylum of [[animal]]s that include the [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, [[crustacean]]s and others that are characterized by the possession of jointed limbs.

This field is very important in medicine, studied together with [[parasitology]]. Medical arthropodology is the study of the parasitic effect of arthropods, not only as parasites but also as vectors. The first annual '' Conference on Medical Arthropodology'' was held in [[Madurai]] ([[Tamil Nadu]]) in 2007.

{{Atmospheric sciences| atmophys=true}}
'''Atmospheric physics''' is the application of [[physics]] to the study of the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]]. Atmospheric physicists attempt to model [[Earth's atmosphere]] and the atmospheres of the other [[planet]]s using [[fluid dynamics|fluid flow]] equations, [[chemistry|chemical]] models, [[radiation budget]], and energy transfer processes in the atmosphere (as well as how these tie into other systems such as the oceans). In order to model weather systems, atmospheric physicists employ elements of [[scattering theory]], wave propagation models, [[cloud physics]], [[statistical mechanics]] and [[spatial statistics]] which are highly mathematical and related to physics. It has close links to [[meteorology]] and [[climatology]] and also covers the design and construction of instruments for studying the atmosphere and the interpretation of the data they provide, including [[remote sensing]] instruments. At the dawn of the space age and the introduction of sounding rockets, [[aeronomy]] became a subdiscipline concerning the upper layers of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important.

== Remote sensing ==
[[Image:weather radar.jpg|thumb|left|Brightness can indicate reflectivity as in this 1960 [[weather radar]] image (of [[1960 Atlantic hurricane season#Hurricane Abby|Hurricane Abby]]). The radar's frequency, pulse form, and antenna largely determine what it can observe.]]

{{Main|Remote sensing}}
Remote sensing is the small or large-scale acquisition of information of an object or phenomenon, by the use of either recording or real-time sensing device(s) that is not in physical or intimate contact with the object (such as by way of [[aircraft]], [[spacecraft]], [[satellite]], [[buoy]], or [[ship]]). In practice, remote sensing is the stand-off collection through the use of a variety of devices for gathering information on a given object or area which gives more information than sensors at individual sites might convey.&lt;ref&gt;COMET program (1999). [http://www.comet.ucar.edu/nsflab/web/remote/121.htm Remote Sensing.] [[University Corporation for Atmospheric Research]]. Retrieved on 2009-04-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, [[Earth observation]] or [[weather satellite]] collection platforms, ocean and atmospheric observing [[weather buoy]] platforms, monitoring of a pregnancy via [[ultrasound]], [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI), [[Positron Emission Tomography]] (PET), and [[space probes]] are all examples of remote sensing. In modern usage, the term generally refers to the use of imaging sensor technologies including but not limited to the use of instruments aboard aircraft and spacecraft, and is distinct from other imaging-related fields such as [[medical imaging]].

There are two kinds of remote sensing. Passive sensors detect natural radiation that is emitted or reflected by the object or surrounding area being observed. Reflected sunlight is the most common source of radiation measured by passive sensors. Examples of passive remote sensors include film [[photography]], infra-red, [[charge-coupled devices]], and [[radiometer]]s. Active collection, on the other hand, emits energy in order to scan objects and areas whereupon a sensor then detects and measures the radiation that is reflected or backscattered from the target. [[radar]], [[lidar]], and [[SODAR]] are examples of active remote sensing techniques used in atmospheric physics where the time delay between emission and return is measured, establishing the location, height, speed and direction of an object.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology (2009). [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=radar1 Radar.] [[American Meteorological Society]]. Retrieved on 2009-24-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote sensing makes it possible to collect data on dangerous or inaccessible areas. Remote sensing applications include monitoring [[deforestation]] in areas such as the [[Amazon Basin]], the effects of [[climate change]] on [[glacier]]s and Arctic and Antarctic regions, and [[depth sounding]] of coastal and ocean depths. Military collection during the [[cold war]] made use of stand-off collection of data about dangerous border areas. Remote sensing also replaces costly and slow data collection on the ground, ensuring in the process that areas or objects are not disturbed.

Orbital platforms collect and transmit data from different parts of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], which in conjunction with larger scale aerial or ground-based sensing and analysis, provides researchers with enough information to monitor trends such as [[El Niño]] and other natural long and short term phenomena. Other uses include different areas of the [[earth science]]s such as [[natural resource management]], agricultural fields such as land usage and conservation, and national security and overhead, ground-based and stand-off collection on border areas.&lt;ref&gt;[[NASA]] (2009).

== Radiation ==
[[Image:seasons.svg|frame|right|This is a diagram of the seasons.  In addition to the density of incident light, the [[dissipation]] of light in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere]] is greater when it falls at a shallow angle.]]
{{see also|Radiation|Effect of sun angle on climate}}
Atmospheric physicists typically divide radiation into solar radiation (emitted by the sun) and terrestrial radiation (emitted by Earth's surface and atmosphere). 

Solar radiation contains variety of wavelengths. Visible light has wavelengths between 0.4 and 0.7&amp;nbsp;micrometers.&lt;ref&gt;Atmospheric Science Data Center. [http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html What Wavelength Goes With a Color?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720105431/http://science-edu.larc.nasa.gov/EDDOCS/Wavelengths_for_Colors.html |date=2011-07-20 }} Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter wavelengths are known as the [[ultraviolet]] (UV) part of the spectrum, while longer wavelengths are grouped into the [[infrared]] portion of the spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Windows to the Universe. [http://www.windows.ucar.edu/tour/link=/earth/Atmosphere/earth_atmosph_radiation_budget.html Solar Energy in Earth's Atmosphere.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; Ozone is most effective in absorbing radiation around 0.25&amp;nbsp;micrometers,&lt;ref name="UDE"&gt;[[University of Delaware]].

This increases the temperature of the nearby [[stratosphere]]. Snow reflects 88% of UV rays,&lt;ref name="UDE"/&gt; while sand reflects 12%, and water reflects only 4% of incoming UV radiation.&lt;ref name="UDE"/&gt; The more glancing the angle is between the atmosphere and the [[sun]]'s rays, the more likely that energy will be reflected or absorbed by the [[atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeling Jesuit University. [http://www.cet.edu/ete/modules/ozone/ozatmo.html Exploring the Environment:  UV Menace.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070830094306/http://www.cet.edu/ete/modules/ozone/ozatmo.html |date=August 30, 2007 }} Retrieved on 2007-06-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrestrial radiation is emitted at much longer wavelengths than solar radiation. This is because Earth is much colder than the sun.   Radiation is emitted by Earth across a range of wavelengths, as formalized in [[Planck's law]]. The wavelength of maximum energy is around 10 micrometers.

== Cloud physics ==
{{Main|Cloud physics}}
Cloud physics is the study of the physical processes that lead to the formation, growth and precipitation of [[cloud]]s. Clouds are composed of microscopic droplets of water (warm clouds), tiny crystals of ice, or both (mixed phase clouds). Under suitable conditions, the droplets combine to form [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], where they may fall to the earth.&lt;ref&gt;Oklahoma Weather Modification Demonstration Program. [http://www.evac.ou.edu/okwmdp/physics.html CLOUD PHYSICS.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723154301/http://www.evac.ou.edu/okwmdp/physics.html |date=2008-07-23 }} Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; The precise mechanics of how a cloud forms and grows is not completely understood, but scientists have developed theories explaining the structure of clouds by studying the microphysics of individual droplets. Advances in radar and satellite technology have also allowed the precise study of clouds on a large scale.

== Atmospheric electricity ==
[[Image:Lightning over Oradea Romania 3.jpg|thumb|right|Cloud to ground [[Lightning]] in the global atmospheric electrical circuit.]]

Atmospheric electricity is the term given to the electrostatics and electrodynamics of the atmosphere (or, more broadly, the atmosphere of any [[planet]]).

Sound and Fury.] Retrieved on 2008-04-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Atmospheric tide ==
{{Main|Atmospheric tide}}
The largest-amplitude atmospheric tides are mostly generated in the [[troposphere]] and [[stratosphere]] when the atmosphere is periodically heated as water vapour and ozone absorb solar radiation during the day. The tides generated are then able to propagate away from these source regions and ascend into the [[mesosphere]] and [[thermosphere]]. Atmospheric tides can be measured as regular fluctuations in wind, temperature, density and pressure. Although atmospheric tides share much in common with ocean tides they have two key distinguishing features:

i) Atmospheric tides are primarily excited by the Sun's heating of the atmosphere whereas ocean tides are primarily excited by the Moon's gravitational field. This means that most atmospheric tides have periods of oscillation related to the 24-hour length of the solar day whereas ocean tides have longer periods of oscillation related to the lunar day (time between successive lunar transits) of about 24 hours 51 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;Glossary of Meteorology. [http://amsglossary.allenpress.com/glossary/search?id=atmospheric-tide1 Atmospheric Tide.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

ii) Atmospheric tides propagate in an atmosphere where density varies significantly with height. A consequence of this is that their amplitudes naturally increase exponentially as the tide ascends into progressively more rarefied regions of the atmosphere (for an explanation of this phenomenon, see below). In contrast, the density of the oceans varies only slightly with depth and so there the tides do not necessarily vary in amplitude with depth.

Note that although solar heating is responsible for the largest-amplitude atmospheric tides, the gravitational fields of the Sun and Moon also raise tides in the atmosphere, with the lunar gravitational atmospheric tidal effect being significantly greater than its solar counterpart.&lt;ref&gt;Scientific American. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=does-the-moon-have-a-tida Does the Moon have a tidal effect on the atmosphere as well as the oceans?.] Retrieved on 2008-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

At ground level, atmospheric tides can be detected as regular but small oscillations in surface pressure with periods of 24 and 12 hours.  Daily pressure maxima occur at 10 a.m. and 10 p.m. local time, while minima occur at 4 a.m. and 4 p.m. local time.  The absolute maximum occurs at 10 a.m. while the absolute minimum occurs at 4 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;Dr James B. Calvert. [http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/geol/tides.htm Tidal Observations.] Retrieved on 2008-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt; However, at greater heights the amplitudes of the tides can become very large. In the [[mesosphere]] (heights of ~ 50 – 100&amp;nbsp;km) atmospheric tides can reach amplitudes of more than 50&amp;nbsp;m/s and are often the most significant part of the motion of the atmosphere.

== Aeronomy ==
{{Main|Aeronomy}}
[[Image:Upperatmoslight1.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Representation of upper-atmospheric lightning and electrical-discharge phenomena]]
Aeronomy is the science of the upper region of the atmosphere, where dissociation and ionization are important. The term aeronomy was introduced by Sydney Chapman in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew F. Nagy, p. 1-2 in ''Comparative Aeronomy'', ed. by Andrew F. Nagy ''et al.'' (Springer 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-387-87824-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the term also includes the science of the corresponding regions of the atmospheres of other planets.  Research in aeronomy requires access to balloons, satellites, and [[sounding rockets]] which provide valuable data about this region of the atmosphere.  [[Atmospheric tide]]s play an important role in interacting with both the lower and upper atmosphere.  Amongst the phenomena studied are [[upper-atmospheric lightning]] discharges, such as luminous events called red [[sprites (lightning)|sprites]], sprite halos, blue jets, and elves.

== Centers of research ==
In the UK, atmospheric studies are underpinned by the [[Met Office]], the [[Natural Environment Research Council]] and the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]]. Divisions of the U.S. [[NOAA|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)]] oversee research projects and [[weather]] modeling involving atmospheric physics. The US [[Arecibo Observatory|National Astronomy and Ionosphere Center]] also carries out studies of the high atmosphere. In [[Belgium]], the [[Belgian Institute for Space Aeronomy]] studies the atmosphere and [[outer space]].

[[Image:Bommersvik.png|thumb|right|Bommersvik Logo]]
'''Bommersvik''' is a '''Union college''' ({{lang-sv|italic=yes|Förbundskola}} from Förbund meaning ''union'' or ''association'' and skola meaning ''school'' or ''college'') built by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Youth League]] (SSU) and is situated outside the municipality of [[Södertälje]] in Sweden. Parts of the college grounds encompass a [[conference centre]] and recreational facilities that are extensively used by social democratic organizations both in Sweden and abroad. An art gallery can also be found on the grounds.

==Mission==
[[Image:Per Albin Hansson föreläser Bommersvik.JPG|thumb|350px|[[Per Albin Hansson]] (Prime Minister of Sweden from 1932 to 1946) delivering an outdoor lecture on Bommersvik grounds. Summer 1940]]
The college was formed because the SSU and the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] planned to educate and train the next generation of trade union and [[Politician|political leaders]] by establishing an institution of higher learning with the mission to instruct these young social democrats on political matters such as trade union agreements and laws. Today it offers many popular courses each year on political science subjects. The curriculum is different from a regular [[political science]] academy in that the content of the courses is primarily focused on issues concerning the politics of the [[labour movement]].

The backgrounds of the professors teaching at the college vary and, depending on the course, lecturers can be recruited from the party and from the unions and labour movement. It is not uncommon for prime ministers or cabinet ministers to lecture on subjects of political interest. The Swedish Prime Minister [[Per Albin Hansson]] lectured at Bommersvik as early as summer 1940.

Many foreign lecturers also visit the college from time to time, starting with the early example of [[Willy Brandt]] who lectured on 1 December 1940 about the problems experienced by the [[social democrats]] in [[Nazi]] Germany and the occupied countries at the start of [[World War II]].

In 2010, the college began cooperating with [[Uppsala University]] so that students from the University can now attend [[rhetoric]] classes at Bommersvik.

==History==
[[Image:Bommersvik flaggor.JPG|thumb|right|200px|left|Colonel Lundeberg extracted a promise from the SSU that the [[Swedish flag]] would always be raised higher than the SSU [[Banner#Trade union banners|banner]]. This promise has been kept by the SSU ever since.]]
In 1934, ideas about creating a college for the Youth League began to form after Ivan Ohlson, one of the great leaders of the Swedish Labor movement, became inspired following a study trip to the [[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] and in 1936 work commenced to find an appropriate building. This was familiar territory for the SSU since the association already had gone through a similar process with another school, the Brunnsviks adult education college in Ludvika. Ivan Ohlson went on a late summer day to Bommersvik, with its beautiful natural surroundings, was sufficiently impressed with the place and recommended it as the future location for the school. His recommendation was officially adopted and in 1937 the decision was formalised. Ivan Ohlson is considered to be the founder of Bommersvik and one of the school's halls is named in his honour.

It was decided, after a search, that the school would be built on the grounds of a local farm. This property was owned by [[Colonel]] Lundeberg.

Only through a fundraising drive among the members and other organisations within the [[Labor Movement]], including the social democratic women's association, the party and trade unions etc. could the Socialist Party and the SSU find sufficient funds to buy Colonel Lundeberg's farm. The colonel, however, thought that selling the farm directly to the SSU was a sensitive matter, (since he was a military man with no association with the socialists), so, officially, Ivan Ohlson bought the farm instead, for 127,000 sek and a down payment of 20 000 which was a lot of money at that time. Colonel Lundeberg also extracted a promise from the SSU that the [[Swedish flag]] would always be raised higher than the SSU [[Banner#Trade union banners|banner]]. This promise has been kept by the SSU ever since.

The opening ceremony was held on 14 September 1937 with about 800 SSU members and party officials on the grounds. There was also high pressure on the officials involved because, among other things, of the press coverage of the event and of the political pressure by the social democrats. Algot Andersson became the first manager of the college.

Another important event took place when [[Tage Erlander]] withdrew in 1969 as party leader and Prime Minister, and his successor in both positions, [[Olof Palme]], ordered an honorary residence be built for him on the grounds of Bommersvik, in recognition of Erlander's valuable and lengthy service as Prime Minister of Sweden. The house is called even to this day "Erlandervillan" meaning ''Erlander's villa''. There, he and his wife Aina lived until his death in 1985.

==Culture and art==

[[Image:Olof Palme statsminister, tidigt 70-tal.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Olof Palme]] (pictured) donated the majority of the vases from the Ming Dynasty]]
Social democratic Prime Ministers have brought, from time to time, [[work of art|objets d'art]] and other curios on their travels to the college in order to enhance its culture and [[fine art|art]] collections. For example, [[Olof Palme]] has donated to the school the majority of the vases from the [[Ming Dynasty]], the stuffed remains of a tiger and a gold statue of an [[Inca]] god. Various countries have also donated items for the school's collection. Perhaps the most controversial present was from [[North Vietnam]], namely the part of an American airplane shot down during the [[Vietnam war]]. This piece exists as a display case exhibit at the school.

In the college, students learn about [[criticism]] of society and there also exist pictures of famous artists that created fine portraits of well-known social democrats. There is a large library with books about policy and from authors that describe the workers' lives in Sweden, the so-called ''proletärförfattare,'' ([[Swedish language|Swedish]]:'' proletär'' meaning ''[[proletarian]]'' and ''författare'' meaning ''author,'' i.e. authors for the [[proletariat]]), such as [[Eyvind Johnson]] and [[Harry Martinson]] who shared the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1974.

===Significant art exhibits===
* One of the most well-known sculptures in Bommersvik is Arne Jones's "Katedralen" (''Cathedral''), also featured on Bommervik's logo.&lt;ref name="Katedralen picture"&gt;[http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=60 Katedralen picture from the Bommersvik website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622062241/http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=29&amp;Itemid=60 |date=22 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Torchlight processions", depicting the infamous [[Triumph of the Will|Nazi torchlight marches]], by artist Eric Johnsson. SSU received this as a present in 1937 as an indication of gratitude. Eric had among other things been forced to escape from [[Nazi Germany]]. SSU had criticized the [[Nazis]] in Germany long before the parent party did so in public.
[[Image:Bommersvik.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Bommersvik's main building: the Manor]]
* Tage Erlander and his legacy have always been important to the school and there are many portraits of him by artists such as Bo Beskow, Stig Claesson and Willem de Geer.
* The large oil painting "Proletarian fighting will" (Swedish: ''Proletär kampvilja'' the latter from ''kamp'' meaning ''fight'' and ''vilja'' meaning ''will'') by Albin Amelin that hangs in the dining room is also a gift. The Amelin family wanted it to be displayed in a prominent place where many socialist supporters and members could view it.
* A copy of Carl Elds' sculpture “[[Youth]]” is exhibited while the original is left in the National museum.
* Folke Allards' [[aquarelle]] "Bommersvik i sommarskrud" (translated as: ''Bommersvik in summer clothes'') is also a gift.
* “Light and mood” by [[Gösta Werner (painter)]] is an [[abstract painting]] and an attempt to expand artistic horizons and to depart from the tradition of [[socialist realism]].
* Sculptor [[Willy Gordon]] created "The meeting" in [[Scale model|miniature]] and the original exists in [[Östermalmstorg]] in Stockholm. ''The meeting,'' ({{lang-sv|Mötet}}), is a controversial group of two modern sculptures representing a naked male figure bearing a piece of meat on his shoulders before a recumbent female figure.
* Ely Maoz, a well-known artist from [[Chile]], painted a picture that hangs on a wall of the wing together with some SSU members' paintings. The painting is called "Freedom for all and Peace for the whole world". It was given to the school as a gesture of appreciation since the SSU criticized the [[Augusto Pinochet|dictatorship in Chile]].

==Symbolic value==
[[Image:Tage Erlander, Bommersvik 1948.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tage Erlander]] ( Prime Minister of Sweden from 1946 to 1969.) dictating a letter to his secretary Maria Nyström in the natural surroundings of Bommersvik. Summer 1948.]]
Bommersvik possesses symbolic value for social democrats worldwide, and has become something of a socialist [[Mecca]] for them. This is also true for those who choose to tie the knot in Bommersvik. For example, two famous locals, Roger Möller and Gerd married there in 1978. Roger Möller later went on to become manager of the school. Many high echelon social democratic party officials have traditionally visited the place and many important meetings were scheduled in Bommersvik. Decisions such as, for example about ATP, have been discussed and analyzed at Bommersvik.

Bommersvik is a place that is a [[sanctuary]] and a source of inspiration for many, while also providing a recreation haven for social democrats. SSU member Lotta Axelsson described Bommersvik this way: ''Bommersvik inspires new ideas, and provides possibilities for recreation and strolling in a natural setting and for rest. There is actually little discussion about socialist issues during leisure activities, as visitors long for going back to nature.''

Social democrat [[Member of Parliament|parliamentarians]] and government ministers come to Bommersvik when they need inspiration. For example, [[Ingvar Carlsson]] went to Bommersvik after the assassination of [[Olof Palme]] in order to relax there before presenting his new cabinet and the [[speech from the throne]].

==International conferences==
After the “[[Milan]]” building with its [[:wikt:conference|conference]] and lecture halls and interpreter facilities was completed in 1978 it was natural that the [[Socialist International]] organisation would now book conferences for Bommersvik.&lt;ref name="Milan pictures"&gt;[http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=68 Milan pictures from the Bommersvik website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070828004622/http://www.bommersvik.se/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=38&amp;Itemid=68 |date=28 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Milan building and its facilities were inaugurated during the European Labor movement's conference in 1979, with a return engagement in 1985. Both conferences were convened by Palme, the Social Democratic Party leader. Many famous social democrats from other countries have visited Bommersvik through the years, including [[Shimon Peres]], [[Neil Kinnock]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Trygve Bratteli]], [[Poul Nyrup Rasmussen]], [[Kalevi Sorsa]], [[Mário Soares]], [[François Mitterrand]] and [[Bruno Kreisky]]. In addition, many other international conferences have also been held there, such as, for example, the [[International Union of Socialist Youth#IUSY Congresses|1989 congress]] of the [[International Union of Socialist Youth]] and the 2003 congress of the European Community Organisation of Socialist Youth ([[ECOSY]]). Anders Lindberg became the first Swedish president of ECOSY when he was elected by this congress.

==The Bommersvik Declarations==
Bommersvik played a central role in [[international politics]] in 1995 and 2002 when the two conventions of the Elected [[Legislature|Representatives]] of the [[Myanmar|Union of Burma]] took place and the following two landmark declarations were issued:&lt;ref name="Burma Library"&gt;[http://www.burmalibrary.org/reg.burma/archives/199507/msg00263.html Burma Library website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Landmark Declarations from Burma Lawyers' Council"&gt;[http://www.blc-burma.org/html/Declaration%20treaty%20agreements/bsdeclara2.html Burma Lawyers' Council characterizes Declarations as Landmark]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bommersvik Declaration I===
In 1995, during the first convention that lasted from 16–23 July, the [[National Coalition Government of the Union of Burma|Representatives]] issued the ''Bommersvik [[Declaration of independence|Declaration]] I'' with the following preamble:&lt;ref name="Bommersvik Declaration from NCGUB website"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_1995# |title=Bommersvik Declaration from NCGUB website |access-date=1 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070916/http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_1995# |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''We, the representatives of the people of Burma, elected in 27 May 1990 general elections, meeting at the First Convention of Elected Representatives from the liberated areas of Burma, hereby – Warmly welcome the unconditional release of 1991 [[Nobel Peace Prize|Nobel Peace laureate]] [[Aung San Suu Kyi|Daw Aung San Suu Kyi]] on 10 July 1995; Thank all who have worked tirelessly and consistently for the release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the cause of democracy in Burma; Applaud Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's determination, in spite of having spent 6 years under house arrest, to continue to work to bring true democracy to Burma; Welcome Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's return to politics to take up the mantle of her father, General [[Aung San]], in Burma's second struggle for independence;...''|The Elected Representatives of the Union of Burma}}

===Bommersvik Declaration II===
In 2002, during the second convention that lasted from 25 February to 1 March, the Representatives issued the ''Bommersvik Declaration II'' with the following introduction:&lt;ref name="Bommersvik Declaration ΙΙ from NCGUB website"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_2002# |title=Bommersvik Declaration ΙΙ from NCGUB website |access-date=1 October 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928070823/http://www.ncgub.net/staticpages/index.php/Bommersvik_Declaration_2002# |archive-date=28 September 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Budker institut akademgorodok.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The Budker Institute in winter]]

The '''Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics''' ('''BINP''') is one of the major centres of advanced study of [[nuclear physics]] in [[Russia]]. It is located in the [[Siberian]] town [[Akademgorodok]], on [[Academician Lavrentyev Avenue, Novosibirsk|Academician Lavrentiev Avenue]]. The institute was founded by [[Gersh Itskovich Budker]] in 1959. Following his death in 1977, the institute was renamed in honour of Academician Budker.

Despite its name, the centre was not involved either with military atomic science or nuclear reactors{{mdash}} instead, its concentration was on high-energy physics (particularly [[Plasma (physics)|plasma physics]]) and particle physics. In 1961 the institute began building [[:ru:ВЭП-1|VEP-1]],&lt;ref name="BINP-history"&gt;A. N.

The '''Center for Biofilm Engineering''' ('''CBE''') is an interdisciplinary research, education, and technology transfer institution located on the central campus of [[Montana State University]] in [[Bozeman, Montana]]. The center was founded in April 1990 as the '''Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering''' with a grant from the [[Engineering Research Centers]] (ERC) program of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF).&lt;ref name=charter&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/NSF-awd-lttr_CIMPEwb.pdf |title=Original Charter |publisher=National Science Foundation |date=April 15, 1990 |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CBE integrates faculty from multiple university departments to lead multidisciplinary research teams—including graduate and undergraduate students—to advance fundamental [[biofilm]] knowledge, develop beneficial uses for microbial biofilms, and find solutions to industrially relevant biofilm problems. The center tackles biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]] through cross-disciplinary research and education among [[engineers]], [[microbiologists]] and industry.&lt;ref name=Invade/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBEResearch/&gt;

==History==
The center originated as the Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) in 1983.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; In 1990, the center became a national ERC as the Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering based on a $7.2 million grant from the NSF.&lt;ref name="Environment/Ecology Grants"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/11538/title/Science-Grants/ |title=Environment/Ecology Grants |journal=The Scientist |volume=4 |number=24 |page=25 |date=December 10, 1990 |accessdate=2015-02-27|quote=To establish new Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering; work will focus on biofouling and biocorrosion, bioremediation, and biohydrometallurgy. $7.2 million from NSF to Montana State University, Bozeman. |publisher=LabX Media Group |location=Midland, Ontario, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993 the center assumed its current name-Center for Biofilm Engineering. The original grants expired in 2001 and the center became self-sufficient. The center celebrated its 25&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; anniversary as an NSF ERC in 2015.

===Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (1979–1990)===
In 1979 W.G. (Bill) Characklis came to Montana State University from [[Rice University]] as a professor in civil (environmental) and chemical engineering. He assembled a multidisciplinary team of [[engineer]]s, [[microbiologist]]s and [[chemist]]s to study the processes and effects of microbial growth at interfaces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=InProcess |title=Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering Newsletter |date=Fall 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established a cross-disciplinary environmental biotechnology institute to address the needs of industry in the areas of [[biofouling]], [[microbial corrosion]] and biofilm technology.&lt;ref name=CBE1990&gt;{{cite report |title=Report on Research 1990, Montana State University |pages=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute for Chemical and Biological Process Analysis (IPA) was chartered by the [[Montana University System|Montana Board of Regents]] in 1983 within the Montana State University College of Engineering. Bill Characklis was its first director. The IPA provided the foundation for eventual Engineering Research Center status in several ways. The IPA conducted fundamental research, development, and testing for industry and government agencies and it pursued biofilm projects that crossed traditional scientific discipline boundaries.&lt;ref name=news1983&gt;Brochure: "Montana State University introduces The Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." 1983&lt;/ref&gt; The IPA established an Industrial Associates membership program and by 1989 the program had 12 participating members, each contributing $10,000 annually to the center. Membership benefits provided them the opportunity to assist in critiquing and defining the IPA research programs. Members included oil/gas/power companies, a chemical manufacturer, a pulp and paper company and partnership with the [[Idaho National Engineering Laboratory]].&lt;ref&gt;Report: "Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis." February 1989, p 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering (1990–1993)===
[[File:Confocal Microscopes Center for Biofilm Research MSU.jpg|thumb|250px|alt=photograph of microscope|Leica [[Confocal laser scanning microscopy|confocal microscope systems]]]]
In 1989, the IPA applied to the NSF for Engineering Research Center status, which was granted in April 1990.&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; The Center for Interfacial Microbial Process Engineering was established as one of three national Engineering Research Centers out of 48 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |title=Strategic Plan of the Institute for Biological and Chemical Process Analysis |date=February 1989 |page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an ERC, the new organization was charged with building a cross-disciplinary research and education program at Montana State University, as well as increasing U.S. industrial competitiveness in biofilm related technologies. The center's charter mandated that research, education, and technology transfer programs would be fully integrated within the center's program planning. The Industrial Associates program continued to be used as a mechanism for the center to get information from industry about significant biofilm-related problems and collaborate on center research initiatives designed to address biofilm issues. The center’s education program recruited students to participate on interdisciplinary research teams and to interact with industry representatives.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt;

The provision of $7.2 million in grants from the NSF during the first five years enabled the expansion of center research into new areas, notably [[bioremediation]] and [[biohydrometallurgy]]. The center's industrial focus expanded from biofilm control and mitigation to include positive use of biofilm processes to break up soil and water contaminants as well as extracting minerals from low-grade ores.&lt;ref name=CBE1990/&gt; Center projects were designed to span scales of inquiry from fundamental bench-scale to applied field-scale experiments. These projects enabled the continued development of microsensors to measure gradients of gases and pH within biofilm communities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lewandowski Z, Lee W, Characklis WG, Little BJ | year = 1989 | title = Dissolved oxygen and pH microelectrode measurements at water-immersed metal surfaces | url = | journal = Corrosion Science | volume = 45 | issue = 2| pages = 92–98 | doi=10.5006/1.3577838}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[microscopy]] to elucidate physiological activity of community organisms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Wentland, Eric J.; Stewart, Philip S.; Huang, Ching-Tsan; McFeters, Gordon A. |title=Spatial variations in growth rate within Klebsiella pneumoniae colonies and biofilm |journal=Biotechnology Progress |date=1996 |volume=12 |issue=3 |pages=316–321 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=American Institute of Chemical Engineers |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1021/bp9600243/abstract |doi=10.1021/bp9600243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and modeling to predict biofilm behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.260411005/abstract |authors=Jones, Warren L.; Dockery, Jack D.; Vogel, Curtis R.; Sturman, Paul J. |title=Diffusion and reaction within porous packing media: A phenomenological model |journal=Biotechnology and Bioengineering |date= April 25, 1993 |volume=41 |issue=10 |pages=947–956 |accessdate=2015-03-06 |publisher=Wiley Periodicals, Inc. |doi=10.1002/bit.260411005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Center for Biofilm Engineering (1993–present)===
In 1992, two years after its establishment, the center's first director, Bill Characklis, died. Montana State University signaled its commitment to the center by hiring J.W. (Bill) Costerton, a professor of microbiology from the [[University of Calgary]], as Executive Director and James Bryers, a professor of biochemical engineering from [[Duke University]], as Director of Research for the center. In 1993 the center’s name was changed to Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE).&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering News, 1993 April;1(1):1-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Costerton's direction the center continued to fulfill its charter and began expanding its scope of inquiry. Costerton encouraged exploration of the [[bioelectric]] effect,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Costerton J.William; Ellis, Brian; Lam, Kan; Johnson, Frank; Khoury, Antoine E. |title=Mechanism of the electrical enhancement of the efficacy of antibiotics in killing biofilm bacteria |journal=Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy |date=December 1994 |volume=38 |issue=12 |pages=2803–2809 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |url=http://aac.asm.org/content/38/12/2803.full.pdf+html |accessdate=2015-02-28 |doi=10.1128/aac.38.12.2803|pmc=188289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the phenomenon of cell-cell signaling and its relation to biofilm structure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Davies, D.G.; Geesey, G.G.|title=Regulation of the alginate biosynthesis gene algC in Pseudomonas aeruginosa during biofilm development in continuous culture |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC167351/pdf/610860.pdf |format=pdf |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |date=March 1995 |volume=61 |issue=3 |pages=860–7 |accessdate=2015-03-02 |publisher=American Society for Microbiology |pmc=167351 |pmid=7793920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsurface biobarrier technologies to protect water and soils from mining contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=James, Garth A., Warwood, Bryan K.; Cunningham Alfred B.; Sturman, Paul J.; Hiebert, Randall; Costerton J.W. |url=http://www.engg.ksu.edu/HSRC/95Proceed/james.pdf |format=pdf |date=May 24, 1995 |title=Evaluation of subsurface biobarrier formation and persistence |journal=Proceedings of the 10th Annual Conference on Hazardous Waste Research, Manhattan, KS. |pages=82–91 |accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial interest and membership grew in response to more diversified research topics. By 1996 Industrial Associate membership had grown to 19 diversified members including members representing water treatment, mining, government labs, specialty chemicals, consumer products, and oil/energy companies.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering Year Seven Report and Renewal Proposal, February 1997; Table 9.3.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1996 the National Science Foundation renewed its commitment to the Center for Biofilm Engineering with a new five year grant of $7.6 million.&lt;ref name=Invade&gt;{{cite journal |title=Biofilms Invade Microbiology-Linking Microbiology and Engineering |author=Potera, Carol |journal=Science |date=September 27, 1996 |volume=273 |issue=5283 |pages=1795–1796 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |doi=10.1126/science.273.5283.1795 |jstor=2891076}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the national profile of the CBE and biofilm research was on the rise. Numerous scientific and mass media publications began to address biofilm technology in ernest.

===Self-sufficiency (2001–)===
The NSF ERC program was designed to create institutional centers that would be self-sufficient within ten years. The Center for Biofilm Engineering at Montana State University started planning for self-sufficiency in 1998 through the establishment of a Self-sufficiency Task Force at the university. The center achieved self-sufficiency in 2001 and continues to be funded in part through federal and private grants with continued emphasis on providing value to the Industrial Associates, and support from Montana State University and the [[Montana|State of Montana]].&lt;ref&gt;Center for Biofilm Engineering Final Report. February 2001. p15.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Philip S. Stewart, a professor of chemical and biological engineering, was selected to be the third CBE Director. Stewart, who had participated as a CBE faculty member since 1991, was a leading expert on antimicrobials and biofilm control.&lt;ref name=deBeer&gt;{{cite journal|authors=de Beer, Dirk; Srinivasan, Rohini; and Stewart, Philip S. |title=Direct measurement of chlorine penetration into biofilms during disinfection |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |date=December 1994 |volume=60 |number=12 |pages=4339–4344 |url=http://aem.asm.org/content/60/12/4339.full.pdf+html |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v426/n6964/full/nature02122.html |authors=Mah, Thien Fah; Pitts, Betsey; Pellock, Brett; Walker, Graham C.; Stewart, Philip S.; O’Toole, George A. |title=A genetic basis for Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm antibiotic resistance |journal=Nature |date=November 20, 2003 |volume=426 |issue=6964 |pages=306–310 |accessdate=2015-02-27 |doi=10.1038/nature02122 |pmid=14628055}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Walters, Marshall C.

====Undergraduate studies====
The Center for Biofilm Engineering's Undergraduate Research Experience (URE) was founded by Director J.W. (Bill) Costerton and Ryan Jordan in the late 1990s. PhD candidate (and subsequent Senior Research Engineer at the CBE)  Jordan directed the CBE's first URE students as part of a backcountry water quality program in Yellowstone National Park and the Bridger-Teton Wilderness where URE students under Jordan's direction became the first researchers to identify the role of biofilm in the failure of portable water treatment filters used in disaster relief, military, and outdoor recreation applications.

Undergraduate students are hired as undergraduate research assistants and work in CBE laboratories as members of research teams on interdisciplinary biofilm projects. CBE undergraduates are encouraged to acquire competence in laboratory skills, experimental design and group communication. By 2017, over 785 undergraduates from 11 disciplines had worked on laboratory biofilm projects under the direction of CBE-affiliated faculty members. Twenty-nine of 62 undergraduates (46%) in the 2016-17 academic year were female.&lt;ref name="2014AR"&gt;{{cite report |title=MSU Center for Biofilm Engineering 25 years and growing |date=2014 |pages=1–24 |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/files/CBE/documents/2014_and_25-YrReport_CBE.pdf |format=pdf |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2014ARappx" /&gt;

====Graduate studies====
Graduate students pursue their degree in a discipline offered through one of the science, agriculture, or engineering departments at Montana State University while they conduct their research in CBE laboratories. Student graduate committees are typically interdisciplinary. The student and graduate committee members select coursework appropriate for the student’s interests and degree program. Engineering students are encouraged to take microbiology courses; science students are encouraged to take relevant engineering coursework. Graduate students acquire experience by designing and performing research that crosses traditional academic discipline boundaries and has direct impact on current environmental, industrial, and medical issues. Students work on projects that range from fundamental to applied topics. In addition, the CBE’s Industrial Associates program brings students into working relationships with potential employers. Graduate students are encouraged to develop their communication and leadership skills by presenting at research conferences, mentoring undergraduate students, organizing the CBE’s seminar series, and assisting with outreach efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=CBE Graduate Education |url=http://www.biofilm.montana.edu/node/2184 |publisher=Montana State University |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2017, 256 graduate students had received advanced degrees, including 30 with doctorate degrees and 22 with masters degrees . During the 2016-17 academic year 53% graduate students were female.&lt;ref name=2014AR/&gt;&lt;ref name=2014ARappx/&gt;

&lt;!--==Proposed DYK==
… that the '''[[Center for Biofilm Engineering]]''' at [[Montana State University|MSU]] uses interdisciplinary research &amp; education to tackle biofilm issues including [[chronic wounds]], [[bioremediation]], and [[microbial corrosion]]?--&gt;

&lt;!--Text of source for DYK Hook:

Biofiims were once considered chiefly a practical problem, the province of industrial engineers concerned about corroded pipes and fouled equipment. So in the 1980s, when William Characklis spoke about biofilms at microbiology conferences, the biologists he addressed were not a receptive audience: He was considered a "microbiologist who had fallen amongst engineers," recalls biofilm expert William Costerton. In reality, Characklis, who died an untimely death in 1992 at age 50, was a chemical engineering professor at Montana State University in Bozeman. But he had become convinced that a more biological perspective was needed to understand the puzzling nature of biofilms. Costerton and other biofilm leaders credit Characklis for almost single-handedly bridging biology and engineering, tirelessly crisscrossing the boundary between the two camps by training himself in microbiology, attending meetings, and teaching diverse graduate students. In 1990 Characklis won National Science Foundation (NSF) support to start an Engineering Research Center on biofilms at Montana State. Under his leadership, the center, then called the Center for Microbial Interfacial Process Engineering, drew students and faculty from engineering, science, mathematics, and agricultural departments. After Characklis's death, the center's name changed to the Center for Biofilm Engineering (CBE), but his interdisciplinary vision is thriving under the leadership of microbiologist Costerton. The center's original 5-year NSF grant was renewed in June, for $7.6 million for the next 5 years. One of the center's crucial jobs is to develop tools to study biofilms. For example, early researchers thought that the bacteria grew uniformly in a polysaccharide envelope, a view that stemmed from drying or treating biofilms before studying them. Then in 1991, researchers at the CBE and the University of Saskatchewan in Canada used confocal scanning laser microscopy (CSLM) to examine successive planes in living biofilms in real time. CSLM 
clearly showed that biofilm bacteria grow as remarkably complex microcolonies, crisscrossed by water channels that comprise up to 60% of the biofilm's volume. CBE scientists, led by Zbigniew Lewandow- ski, are now further refining this method with new probes and software for mapping interactions among bacteria. Today the CBE is a haven of interdisciplinary work, with graduate students from 10 departments working in interdisciplinary teams. Engineering students clone genes, microbiologists construct mathematical models, and mathematicians letnm biochemistrv. all to solve real-world problems. "The center has evolved a system that works," says Costerton, who thinks the key to success is the interdisciplinary research teams. A microbiologist may help an engineer do taxonomic mapping of a mixed-species biofilm, then the engineer might help the microbiologist scan the surface of a medical device with a scanning vibrating electrode to measure the extent of biofilm- induced corrosion. Another part of the CBE's mission is to advance industrial competitiveness, by transferring technology to industrial associates such as oil companies or municipal water districts. Microbiologist Rod Donlan of Calgon Corp. in Pittsburgh, for example, has used the center's expertise to find chemical disinfectants that can kill biofilms in industrial water systems. He adopted a CBE- developed staining technique to identify the kinds of bacteria and their metabolic activity inside a biofilm, and this helps him deter- mine which bacteria are harmed by disinfectants. "That's why we're part of the center-because they do basic research that helps us develop new applications," he says. And it's clear that Characklis's cross-disciplinary spirit lives on. During a recent NSF site review, an eminent microbiologist was convinced that two students presenting a project about biofilms degrading trichloroethylene were microbiologists. "They were, in fact, both engineers," says Costerton. -CP--&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3055">The '''Center for Tropical Forest Science''', or CTFS, is a consortium of forest researchers who pursue long-term research on tree populations using comparable census method. The work developed out of a study of 50 hectares of forest on [[Barro Colorado Island]] in Panama begun in 1981. All individual trees larger than 1 centimeter in stem diameter were measured, mapped, and identified, which included 300 different species. This census has been repeated every five years since, most recently in 2010.

A total of 30 research institutions have now carried out parallel censuses of large forest plots. There are four such large-scale census projects in [[Africa]], nine in [[Latin America]], and 25 in [[Asia]]. Moreover, the census program has been expanded to include temperate and subtropical forests in [[China]]. Approximately 4.5 million individual trees of 8500 species are being monitored.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ctfs.si.edu/&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scientific research reports on tree species [[Biodiversity|diversity]], [[range (biology)|distribution]], [[life expectancy|life span]], and growth rates have been published based on these plots.

CTFS is directed out of the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] in [[Panama City]], Panama. Researchers and institutions in 14 other countries participate in the network.

The forest plots include the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctfs.si.edu/plots/summary/ |title=Plots Summary |date= |work= |publisher= Center for Tropical Forest Science |accessdate=19 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Semiotics}}
In [[semiotics]], a '''code''' is a set of [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] or sub-codes currently in use to communicate meaning. The most common is one's [[spoken language]], but the term can also be used to refer to any [[narrative]] form: consider the color scheme of an image (e.g. red for danger), or the rules of a board game (e.g. the military [[Sign (semiotics)|signifiers]] in [[chess]]).

[[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) emphasised that signs only acquire [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[value (semiotics)|value]] when they are interpreted in relation to each other. He believed that the relationship between the signifier and the signified was arbitrary. Hence, interpreting signs requires familiarity with the sets of conventions or codes currently in use to communicate meaning.

[[Roman Jakobson]] (1896–1982) elaborated the idea that the production and interpretation of texts depends on the existence of codes or conventions for communication. Since the meaning of a sign depends on the code within which it is situated, codes provide a framework within which signs make sense (see [[Semiosis]]).

==Discussion==
To that extent, codes represent a broad interpretative framework used by both addressers and their addressees to [[encode (semiotics)|encode]] and [[decode (semiotics)|decode]] the [[message]]s. Self-evidently, the most effective communications will result when both creator and interpreter use exactly the same code. Since signs may have many levels of meaning from the [[denotation (semiotics)|denotational]] to the [[connotation (semiotics)|connotational]], the addresser's strategy is to select and combine the signs in ways that limit the range of possible meanings likely to be generated when the message is interpreted. This will be achieved by including metalingual contextual clues, e.g. the nature of the medium, the [[modality (semiotics)|modality]] of the medium, the [[Stylistics (linguistics)|style]], e.g. [[academic]], [[literature|literary]], [[genre fiction]], etc., and references to, or invocations of, other codes, e.g. a reader may initially interpret a set of signifiers as a [[literal and figurative language|literal]] representation, but clues may indicate a transformation into a [[metaphor]]ical or [[allegorical]] interpretation [[Historical linguistics|diachronically]]. Distinctions of [[Social class|class]] or memberships of groups will be determined by the social identity each individual constructs through the way the language is spoken (i.e. with an [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] or as a [[dialect]]) or written (i.e. in sentences or in [[Short message service|SMS]] format), the place of residence (see [[American English|Americanisms]]), the nature of any employment undertaken, the style of dress, and nonverbal behaviour (e.g. through differentiating [[Norm (sociology)|custom]]s as to the extent of private space, whether and where people may touch or stare at each other, etc.). The process of [[socialisation]] is learning to understand the prevailing codes and then deciding which to apply at any given time, i.e. acknowledging that there is sometimes an [[ideological]] quality to the coding system, determining levels of social acceptability, reflecting current [[attitude (psychology)|attitude]]s and [[belief]]s. This includes regulatory codes that are intended to control behaviour and the use of some signifying codes. The human body is a means of using presentational codes through facial expressions, gestures, and dress. So words spoken may change their connotation to unacceptable if accompanied by inappropriate nonverbal signs.
The other code forms rely upon [[knowledge]] held by, and the interests of, the addressees. Specialised denotational codes may provide a more objective and impersonal form of language for mathematical, philosophical, and scientific texts. Hence, for example, the ability to read this text depends upon a more specialised form of [[vocabulary]] and different skills to those required to read a genre text detailing the investigations of a detective or the adventures of a secret agent. There are also specialised connotational and [[ideological]] codes to reflect particular social, political, moral, and aesthetic values. Musical and iconic codes would be relevant as between a work by [[Arnold Schoenberg]] and a piece of [[bubblegum pop]], and a painting by [[Rembrandt]] and a [[comic book]] by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]], etc. Each medium has its own specialised codes and, by making them more explicit, semiotics is attempting to explain the practices and conventions have appeared in each form and to understand how meaning is being communicated. In return, this assists addressers to improve their techniques, no matter what their functional needs, e.g. as politicians, journalists, advertisers, creative artists, etc. Indeed, awareness leads to an intentional blending of codes for effect, e.g. an advertiser may produce a more effective campaign with a slogan, images and a jingle using lexical, social gestural, and musical codes.
In communication research and [[Media studies|media research]], the way receivers act towards the message and the way it is encoded becomes relevant, and generates different reactions: 
* In "radical reading" the audience rejects the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "dominant reading", the audience accepts the meanings, values, and viewpoints built into the text by its makers.  
* In "subordinate reading" the audience accepts, by and large, the meanings, values, and worldview built into the text by its makers&lt;ref&gt;Danesi, Marcel (2009), Dictionary of Media and Communications. M.E.Sharpe, Armonk, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conservation and restoration of objects made from plastics'''  is an activity dedicated to the [[Conservation (cultural heritage)|conservation]] of objects of historical and personal value made from [[plastics]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]]. Within museum collections there are a variety of artworks and artifacts that are composed of [[plastic]] material whether they are [[Synthetic plastic|synthetic]] or semi-synthetic; these were created for a range of uses from artistic, to technical, to domestic use. Plastics have become an integral component of life and many plastic objects have become staple icons or objects worth preserving for the future.  Although relatively new material for museum collections, plastics having originated in the 19th century, they are deteriorating at an alarming rate, risking the loss not only of the objects themselves, but through their deterioration processes they place objects within their vicinity at risk too.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Plastics are made of synthetic, semi-synthetic and organic material, all of which are susceptible to degradation, with their respective off-gassing being harmful to the objects nearby in museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|pmc=2874019|title=Our Plastic Age|last=Thompson|first=Richard|date=2009|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent changes in plastic manufacturing, as a result of environmental concerns, towards [[biodegradable plastics]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://response.restoration.noaa.gov/about/media/what-you-can-do-keep-plastic-out-ocean.html|title=What You Can Do to Keep Plastic out of the Ocean {{!}} response.restoration.noaa.gov|website=response.restoration.noaa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a potentially negative effect upon the long term stability of such objects within museum collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Madden|first=Odile|date=Spring 2014|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material, a Maturing Profession spring 2014.

== Identification and composition of plastics  ==
All plastics vary by the type of polymer used to create it, these polymers are what conservators look to in order to divide plastics into groupings that could best help create a preservation or restoration plan. Groupings are important as some plastics can be dangerous or even flammable thus it is key to identify these plastics in order to best understand how to store and care for them.

== Identifying plastics ==
Identification of plastic in a collection is extremely important because all plastics release a harmful toxin or gas that can damage nearby objects and by being able to identity the most harmful plastics a preservation plan can be set into place to slow down the effects and protect other objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Plastics are identified in three ways including looking for its trade name, trademark or patent number. Identifying plastic is done in order to  check what the plastic is composed of as different makers and depending on the year are different material could have been used to make the plastic.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2010|title=Care and Identification of Objects Made from Plastic|url=https://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/08-04.pdf|journal=Conserve O Gram|volume=|pages=|via=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is no marker to identify the type of plastic used then it can be identified by using various types of data analyzed using [[Spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] technology like, [[Optical spectrometer|Optical Spectroscopy]], [[Raman spectroscopy|Raman]] and [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infared spectroscopy]] along with [[mass spectrometry]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Other forms of identification include [[elemental analysis]], thermal analysis to decipher the composition of plastics.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Once the composition is found it is best to determine if the plastic in the collection will be considered Malignant or not.

[http://www.modip.ac.uk/ MoDiP], the Museum of Design in plastics,  has created a guide to plastic objects that includes the objects  manufacturing date,  manufacturing process along with its typical characteristics such as feel and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modip.ac.uk/resources/curators_guide/A-Z_plastics|title=A - Z of plastics materials {{!}} Museum of Design in Plastics, MoDiP|website=www.modip.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important because if an object in the collection that is listed here differs from smell or touch then it could be the object has begun to deteriorate. It is also encouraged that if one has an object not listed then they should contact MoDiP to include it to the list.

== Common plastics ==
These are plastics that are still capable of degradation but its effects are not as harmful to nearby objects.The list below is of chemical compositions that make up common plastics found in museum collections:
* Cellulose Esters&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/preserving.html|title=Preserving Plastics: An Evolving Material a Maturing Profession (Feature)|website=www.getty.edu|access-date=2018-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plasticized PVC,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ([[Polyvinyl chloride|Polyvinyl Chloride]], PVC)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.creativemechanisms.com/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-pvc-plastic|title=Everything You Need To Know About PVC Plastic|last=Staff|first=Creative Mechanisms|access-date=2018-04-04|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These are plastics that will age faster if left untreated and have a higher potential or off-gassing or release a toxin that can damage surrounding objects.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; To determine if objects are considered malignant proper identification of the object will be necessary.  
* [[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride)]]
* [[Cellulose nitrate|Cellulose Nitrate]]
* [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]]
* [[Vulcanization|Vulcanized Rubber]] 
* [[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]]

[[Bioplastic|Biodegradable plastics]] have become an issue because as plastic is used in many everyday objects the push to create biodegradable plastics has been on the rise. This causes an issue for conservators because these object will ultimately degrade as their composition is designed to as there is an increase in plastic waste.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; It is these biodegradable plastics that can be prove to be difficult and museums will need to provide research for these items quickly to slow done their deterioration.

== Deterioration ==
Perhaps the most difficult part about plastic deterioration is that one cannot visibly see what types of chemical reactions are occurring inside the polymer or even identity the type of plastic until it is too late. Typically all plastics will give off a distinct odor, leak toxins, or will begin to shrink or crack in some way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/network/identification-of-plastics-by-looking-touching-and-smelling|title=Identification of plastics by looking, touching and smelling|work=Blog|access-date=2018-04-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although deterioration will inevitably happen it is important to know  the causes of it and be able to mitigate it.

=== Causes of deterioration  ===
The cause of deterioration regarding plastics can be linked to age, chemical composition, storage, and improper handling of the objects. Conservators are in place to slow down the processes of deterioration by considering the 4 leading caused of deterioration:

# '''Age'''-  when plastics were first manufactured in the 19th century they were composed of semi-organic material, thus these over the years these objects have deteriorated due to lack of research and improper handling of these plastics.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Without enough time to care for objects the older objects have deteriorated. 
# '''Chemical''' - Depending on the objects' chemical composition, conservators can understand how it will react overtime. Other chemical reactions come from heat, oxygen, light, liquids, additives and biological attacks as these can cause a reaction in the polymer to speed up deterioration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Chemical reactions are also caused by objects coming into contact with water and oxygen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  
# '''Storage-'''  When objects are improperly stored is when contamination and deterioration can occur. This often occurs when temperature or relative humidity fluctuate in the storage area as this causes the polymers to react to the environment and will begin to deteriorate and possible contaminate surrounding objects. Storage should also be thought of as when an object is on exhibit as this is when the object is on display with lights and its temperature and humidity can fluctuate, being able to create a plan to adjust the exhibit case while on display can help prevent any damage.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
# '''Improper handling''' - This is due in part to improper cleaning techniques when using water or solvents on material that do not support those cleaning methods.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Also when handling the objects human error can occur that can cause abrasions or scratches.

=== Types of deterioration  ===
Understanding the different types of plastic chemical degradation as this helps determine what not to expose plastics to  As the polymers that are composed of the plastics can deteriorate easily by changes in temperature, water or light it is important to understand how these affect the polymers. Listed below are the chemical reactions that occur with the deterioration of the polymer's structure.

* '''Photo-oxidative degradation''' refers to plastic object degrading by being exposed to UV and Visible Light although the type of wavelength that will damage the plastic depends on the composition of the polymer.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Singh|first=Balijit|date=2007|title=Mechanistic Implications of Plastic Degradation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0141391007003539|journal=Polymer Degradation and Stability|volume=93|pages=561–584|via=ScienceDirect}}&lt;/ref&gt; In General however, plastic will be affected by light and it is best practice to keep plastic away from light sources as much as possible. 
* '''[[Thermal degradation of polymers|Thermal degradation]]''' affects the whole unit of the polymer that the object is composed of and is affected by the temperature and amount of light the object is exposed to.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; 
* '''Ozone-Induced degradation''' will deteriorate saturated and  unsaturated polymers when the polymer is exposed to "ozone in the air" will speed the process of deterioration.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; A test is conducted to see if the objects has been exposed by taking small samples and analyzed using an [[FTIR]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''[[Catalysis|Catalytic Degradation]]''' Mainly focuses on plastic waste polymers as they are transformed into hydrocarbons
* '''[[Biodegradation]]''' is when the surface or the strength of the plastic changes, these properties allow it to decompose or mineralize by carbon dioxide and water.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;
* '''Decomposition of Hydroperoxides''' is when metal and metal ions are found on the plastic material as this can also lead to the deterioration of the object&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2012|title=Physical and Chemical processes leading to deterioration  of original properties of plastic|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/4_Degradation/2_Physical_and_chemical_processes/4_2_PhysicalAndChemicalProcessesLeadingToDeterioration.pdf|journal=Processes Leading to the Deterioration of Plastics|volume=|pages=|via=POPART}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}Additional effects of deterioration

For plastics composed of [[Cellulose acetate|Cellulose Acetate]] the  most common sign of  deterioration condition is when it this type is exposed to water, it will give off a smell of vinegar ([[Vinegar syndrome]]),  its surface will have  a white powder residue  and it will begin to shrink.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Cellulose Acetate butyrate and Cellulose butyrate will produce [[butyric acid]] which has a "vomit odor".&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Polyvinyl chloride|Poly(Vinyl Chloride]]) will most likely cause a blooming effect, white spores, on the surface that if it comes into contact with other surrounding material it will contaminate it.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

== Preventative care  ==
=== Handling ===
Safety gloves such as those made of Nitrile can help prevent toxins entering the skin when handling plastic objects.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; As plastics can ooze or off-gas material that may or may not be visible to the naked eye wearing gloves other than cotton is recommended.

=== Storage environment ===
Proper storage of plastics can help slow down the degrading process of plastics. Plastics are currently stored with a RH Level of 50% with the storage temperature at 18 degrees Celsius with no light coming into contact with the objects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|date=2014|title=A Safe Space Storage Strategies for Plastics|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/29_1/storage.html|journal=Conservation Perspectives|volume=29|pages=|via=http://getty.edu/conservation/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the composition of each plastic material can be different it is difficult to determine one unifying storage care plan ,thus  understanding the composition of the plastic can help determine their preferred climate levels.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Keeping plastics at a stable low temperature or considering placing these objects either in cold storage or in oxygen impermeable bags helps slow degradation.

Monitoring plastics in their storage environment is done by keeping track of their status and condition by using log entries on Excel spreadsheets or another format. To monitoring their temperature environment this is done using data loggers which track hourly changes in temperature. These methods can help strengthen a plan of preventative care as monitoring their status along with temperature can help connect any changes that occur.

=== Long-term storage equipment ===
Adsorbents such as "activated carbon, silica gel and zeolites"  are used as they can help with the gasses that are released from plastics as this material can help slow down the degrading process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; These absorbents can also be used when the object is on display to prevent and off-gassing that could occur, so these can be used on exhibit and long-term storage. Absorbents along with acid-free boxes and silica gel can help slow down the process of degradation and [[Cellulose acetate film|vinegar syndrome]] which is common in film, Lego and artwork. A yearly check up of plastic objects can help monitor the condition of plastic objects as well as the condition of the surrounding objects to ensure they have not been contaminated.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Objects composed of Cellulose Nitrate  benefit from cold storage as they are sensitive to increases in temperature.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

'''[http://www.gaylord.com/Preservation/Conservation-Supplies/Wrapping%2C-Lining-%26-Support-Materials/Marvelseal%26%23174%3B-360-Barrier-Film-%2850-ft-%29/p/M3650 Oxygen Impermeable bags]''' are used as they absorb all the oxygen in the bag.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; With no oxygen to trigger the event of deterioration that is used for some plastics the process may be slowed down.

== Conservation   ==
The process of conservation and restoration of plastics requires an understanding of composition of the plastic and an appreciation for the possible methods of restoring plastics and their limitations, as well as an appreciation for the post-treatment preventive care of the object.

=== Cleaning ===
The process of cleaning plastics is done through the use of solvents or using modern technology after identifying the polymers that make up the composition of the plastic. Cleaning can still be done using water or solvents however,  solvents run the risk of physically damaging the object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://popart-highlights.mnhn.fr/wp-content/uploads/5_Active_conservation/1_Conservation_of_plastics_in_collections/5_1_Introduction.pdf|title=Studies in Active Conservation of Plastic Artefacts in Museums|last=Shashoua|first=Yvonne|publisher=POPART|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; A spot test can be performed if uncertain how the object will react to water or solvents.

Light cleaning on the object is possible, but if cleaning requires a heavy hand then the use of  an Erbium: YAG Laser could assist in cleaning tougher scratches or abrasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/eryag-laser|title=Er:YAG laser - an overview {{!}} ScienceDirect Topics|website=www.sciencedirect.com|language=en|access-date=2018-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Scratch removal ===
Within the field of contemporary art, where the finish is part of the artists intent the removal of scratches plays a far greater role than it would with social-historical artifacts, as such conservators have undertaken, and scientifically investigated, a variety of methods of scratch removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Laganà|first=Ana|date=2014|title=Looking through Plastics: Investigating options for the treatment of scratches, abrasions, and losses in cast unsaturated polyester works of art|url=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/education/cons_plastics/related_mats.html|journal=COM-CC 17th Triennial Conference Preprints,|volume=|pages=|via=http://www.getty.edu/conservation/our_projects/science/art_LA/paper_2014_icom_cc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Filling ===
Fillings are used if the object has suffered considerable damage. The process of filling depends on the objects chemical composition consisting  of- refractive indexes, transparency, low viscosity, and its compatibility with the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/blog/conservation-journal/the-use-of-lasers-in-the-conservation-of-museum-objects-made-from-plastics|title=The use of lasers in the conservation of museum objects made from plastics|work=Blog|access-date=2018-03-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15885">'''Criteria air Pollutants''' (CAP), or '''criteria pollutants''', are a set of [[air pollution|air pollutants]] that cause [[smog]], [[acid rain]], and other health hazards&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/criteria-air-pollutants|title=Criteria Air Pollutants {{!}} US EPA|last=EPA,OAR|first=US|website=US EPA|language=en|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. CAPs are typically emitted from many sources in [[industry]], [[mining]], [[transportation]], [[electricity generation]] and [[agriculture]]. In many cases they are the products of the [[combustion]] of [[fossil fuels]] or industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/ard/documents/ard-41.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


==Background==

The six criteria air pollutants were the first set of pollutants recognized by the [[United States]] [[Environmental Protection Agency]] as needing standards on a national level.&lt;ref&gt;Michigan Department Of Environmental Quality, January 2004. What is an Air Contaminant Pollutant? Fact Sheet&lt;/ref&gt; The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to set US [[National Ambient Air Quality Standards]] (NAAQS) for the six CAPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epa.gov/air/criteria.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-02-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110202082735/http://www.epa.gov/air/criteria.html |archivedate=2011-02-02 |df= }} US EPA&lt;/ref&gt; The NAAQS are health based and the EPA sets two types of standards: primary and secondary. The primary standards are designed to protect the health of 'sensitive' populations such as asthmatics, children, and the elderly.  The secondary standards are concerned with protecting the environment.

The EPA established the NAAQS according to Sections 108 and 109 of the U.S. Clean Air Act, which was last amended in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ttnnaaqs/&lt;/ref&gt; These sections require the EPA "(1) to list widespread air pollutants that reasonably may be expected to endanger public health or welfare; (2) to issue air quality criteria for them that assess the latest available scientific information on nature and effects of ambient exposure to them; (3) to set primary NAAQS to protect human health with adequate margin of safety and to set secondary NAAQS to protect against welfare effects (e.g., effects on vegetation, ecosystems, visibility, climate, manmade materials, etc); and (5) to periodically review and revise, as appropriate, the criteria and NAAQS for a given listed pollutant or class of pollutants."&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=158823&lt;/ref&gt;

==Six Criteria Air Pollutants==
# [[Tropospheric Ozone|Ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;): Ozone found on the surface-level, also known as tropospheric ozone is also regulated by the NAAQS under the Clean Air Act.  Ozone was originally found to be damaging to grapes in the 1950s.  The US EPA set "oxidants" standards in 1971, which included ozone.  These standards were created to reduce agricultural impacts and other related damages.  Like lead, ozone requires a reexamination of new findings of health and vegetation effects periodically.  This aspect necessitated the creation of a US EPA criteria document.  Further analysis done in 1979 and 1997 made it necessary to significantly modify the pollution standards
#
# [[Atmospheric particulate matter]]
#* PM&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, coarse particles: 2.5 [[micrometre|micrometers]] (μm) to 10 μm in size (although current implementation includes all particles 10 μm or less in the standard)
#* PM&lt;sub&gt;2.5&lt;/sub&gt;, fine particles: 2.5 μm in size or less. Particulate Matter (PM) was listed in the 1996 Criteria document issued by the EPA.  In April 2001, the EPA created a Second External Review Draft of the Air Quality Criteria for PM, which addressed updated studies done on particulate matter and the modified pollutant standards done since the First External Review Draft.  In May 2002, a Third External Review Draft was made, and the EPA revised PM requirements again.  After issuing a fourth version of the document, the EPA issued the final version in October 2004.
#
# [[Lead]] (Pb): In the mid-1970s, lead was listed as a criteria air pollutant that required NAAQS regulation.  In 1977, the EPA published a document which detailed the Air Quality Criteria for lead.  This document was based on the scientific assessments of lead at the time.  Based on this report (1977 Lead AQCD), the EPA established a "1.5 µg/m3 (maximum quarterly calendar average) Pb NAAQS in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;http://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/cfm/recordisplay.cfm?deid=158823.&lt;/ref&gt;" The Clean Air Act requires periodic review of NAAQS, and new scientific data published after 1977 made it necessary to revise the standards previously established in the 1977 Lead AQCD document.  An Addendum to the document was published in 1986 and then again as a Supplement to the 1986 AQCD/Addendum in 1990. In 1990, a Lead Staff Paper was prepared by the EPA's Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OPQPS), which was based on information presented in the 1986 Lead/AQCD/Addendum and 1990 Supplement, in addition to other OAQPS sponsored lead exposure/risk analyses.  In this paper, it was proposed that the Pb NAAQS be revised further and presented options for revision to the EPA.  The EPA elected to not modify the Pb NAAQS further, but decided to instead focus on the 1991 U.S. EPA Strategy for Reducing Lead Exposure.  The EPA concentrated on regulatory and remedial clean-up efforts to minimize Pb exposure from numerous non-air sources that caused more severe public health risks, and undertook actions to reduce air emissions.
#
# [[Carbon monoxide]] (CO): The EPA set the first NAAQS for carbon monoxide in 1971.  The primary standard was set at 9 ppm averaged over an 8-hour period and 35 ppm over a 1-hour period.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/carbonmonoxide/.&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of CO emitted into the ambient air is from mobile sources.  The EPA has reviewed and assessed the current scientific literature with respect to CO in 1979, 1984, 1991, and 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/ncea/pdfs/coaqcd.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; After the review in 1984 the EPA decided to remove the secondary standard for CO due to lack of significant evidence of the adverse environmental impacts. On January 28, 2011 the EPA decided that the current NAAQS for CO were sufficient and proposed to keep the existing standards as they stood. The EPA is strengthening monitoring requirements for CO by calling for CO monitors to be placed in strategic locations near large urban areas. Specifically, the EPA has called for monitors to be placed and operational in CBSA's (core based statistical areas) with populations over 2.5 million by January 1, 2015; and in CBSA's with populations of 1 million or more by January 1, 2017. In addition they are requiring the collocation of CO monitors with NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; monitors in urban areas having a population of 1 million for more.  As of May 2011 there were approximately 328 operational CO monitors in place nationwide.  The EPA has provided some authority to the EPA Regional Administrators to oversee case-by-case requested exceptions and in determining the need for additional monitoring systems above the minimum required.&lt;ref name="CO"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/carbonmonoxide/pdfs/COFactSheet.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA reports the national average concentration of CO has decreased by 82% since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/carbon.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last nonattainment designation was deemed in attainment on September 27, 2010.  Currently all areas in the US are in attainment.&lt;ref name="CO"/&gt;
#
# [[Sulfur oxide]]s (SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;): SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; refers to the oxides of sulfur, a highly reactive group of gases.  SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is of greatest interest and is used as the indicator for the entire SO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; family. The EPA first set primary and secondary standards in 1971.  Dual primary standards were set at 140 ppb averaged over a 24-hour period, and at 30 ppb averaged annually.  The secondary standard was set at 500 ppb averaged over a 3-hour period, not to be exceeded more than once a year.  The most recent review took place in 1996 during which the EPA considered implementing a new NAAQS for 5-minute peaks of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; affecting sensitive populations such as asthmatics.  The Agency did not establish this new NAAQS and kept the existing standards.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.epa.gov/airquality/sulfurdioxide/.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the EPA decided to replace the dual primary standards with a new 1-hour standard set at 75 ppb.  On March 20, 2012 the EPA "took final action" to maintain the existing NAAQS as they stood.&lt;ref&gt;http://www3.epa.gov/airquality/sulfurdioxide/pdfs/20120320factsheet.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; Only three monitoring sites have exceeded the current NAAQS for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, all of which are located in the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park.  The violations occurred between 2007-2008 and the state of Hawaii suggested these should be exempt from regulatory actions due to an 'exceptional event' (volcanic activity).  Since 1980 the national concentration of SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the ambient air has decreased by 83%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/sulfur.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  Annual average concentrations hover between 1-6 ppb.  Currently all ACQR's are in attainment for SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/sulfurdioxide/basic.html.&lt;/ref&gt;
#
# [[Nitrogen oxide]]s (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;): The EPA first set primary and secondary standards for the oxides of nitrogen in 1971.  Among these are nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), all of which are covered in the NAAQS.  NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the oxide measured and used as the indicator for the entire NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; family as it is of the most concern due to its quick formation and contribution to the formation of harmful ground level ozone.&lt;ref name="airqualityNO"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/nitrogenoxides/.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971 the primary and secondary NAAQS for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were both set at an annual average of 0.053 ppm.  The EPA reviewed this NAAQS in 1985 and 1996, and in both cases concluded that the existing standard was sufficient.  The most recent review by the EPA occurred in 2010, resulting in a new 1-hour NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; primary standard set at 100 ppb; the annual average of 0.053 ppm remained the same.  Also considered was a new 1-hour secondary standard of 100 ppb.  This was the first time the EPA reviewed the environmental impacts separate from the health impacts for this group of criteria air pollutants&lt;ref name="airqualityNO"/&gt;  Also, in 2010, the EPA decided to ensure compliance by strengthening monitoring requirements, calling for increased numbers of monitoring systems near large urban areas and major roadways. On March 20, 2012 the EPA "took final action" to maintain the existing NAAQS as they stand.&lt;ref&gt;Fact Sheet – Air Quality Designations for the 2010 Primary Nitrogen Dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) National Ambient Air Quality Standards http://www.epa.gov/airquality/nitrogenoxides/designations/pdfs/20120120FS.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; The national average of NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; concentrations has dropped by 52% since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airtrends/nitrogen.html.&lt;/ref&gt;  The annual concentration for NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reported to be averaging around 10-20 ppb, and is expected to decrease further with new mobile source regulations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/airquality/nitrogenoxides/basic.html.&lt;/ref&gt;   Currently all areas of the US are classified as in attainment.&lt;ref name="airqualityNO"/&gt;

==EPA Endangerment Findings/ Mass v. EPA==
In 2009, the EPA Administrator found that under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act greenhouse gases threaten both the public health and the public welfare, and that greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicles contribute to that threat. This final action has two distinct 'findings,' which are:

1) The ''''Endangerment Finding'''' in which the Administrator found that the mix of atmospheric concentrations of six key, well-mixed greenhouse gases threatens both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations. These six greenhouse gases are: carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). These greenhouse gases in the atmosphere constitute the "air pollution" that threatens both public health and welfare.

2) The ''''Cause or Contribute Finding''',' in which the Administrator found that the combined greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric concentrations of these key greenhouse gases and hence to the threat of climate change.

The EPA issued these endangerment findings in response to the 2007 supreme court case [[Massachusetts v. EPA]], when the court determined that greenhouse gases are air pollutants according to the Clean Air Act. The court made the decision that the EPA must determine whether greenhouse gas emissions from new motor vehicles "cause or contribute to air pollution which may be reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare, or whether the science is too uncertain to make a reasoned decision" (EPA's Endangerment Finding).

The EPA determined that, according to this decision, there are six greenhouse gases that need to be regulated. These include: 
* [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)
* [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)
* [[hydrofluorocarbons]] (HFCs)
* [[perfluorocarbons]] (PFCs)
* [[sulfur hexafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)
This action allowed the EPA to set the greenhouse gas emission standards to light-duty vehicles proposed jointly with the Department of Transportation's [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] (CAFE) standards in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/endangerment/EndangermentFinding_FAQs.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Petition to Add Seven Criteria Air Pollutants==
On December 2, 2009, the Center for Biological Diversity and [[350.org]] requested that the EPA recognize that carbon dioxide and other GHGs are reasonably anticipated to endanger public health and welfare.  Petitioners proposed that EPA list carbon dioxide as a criteria air pollutant, as outlined in the Clean Air Act.  They also requested that the EPA set NAAQS for carbon dioxide at no greater than 350 ppm- a "level that accurately reflects the most recent scientific knowledge."  Petitioners further requested that EPA designate the five other greenhouse gases, highlighted in Mass v. EPA, as criteria pollutants as well and establish pollution caps for them.  Furthermore, the petitioners proposed that nitrogen trifluoride (NF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) be regulated as a criteria air pollutant in addition to the other six.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/climate_law_institute/global_warming_litigation/clean_air_act/pdfs/Petition_GHG_pollution_cap_12-2-2009.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel A. Vallero''' is an American environmental author&lt;ref&gt;[http://store.elsevier.com/Daniel-Vallero/ELS_1007685/ Author page at Elsevier]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470259603.fmatter/summary/ Author page at John Wiley &amp; Sons]&lt;/ref&gt; and scientist. He was born in [[East St. Louis, Illinois]] and grew up in [[Collinsville, Illinois]]. He received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in city and regional planning from [[Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville]].  He also earned a masters in civil and environmental engineering (environmental health sciences) from the [[University of Kansas]] and a PhD in civil and environmental engineering from [[Duke University]] with a thesis on "“Dicarboximide Fungicide Flux to the Lower Troposphere from an Aquic Hapludult Soil”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cee.duke.edu/faculty/daniel-vallero Faculty page at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://fds.duke.edu/db/pratt/cee/faculty/daniel.vallero/files/CV.pdf Curriculum vitae at Duke]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

Vallero is recognized internationally for advancing the state of environmental science and engineering, as an author, educator, engineer and scientific researcher. He has appeared on news and other shows, recently discussing [[plastic recycling]] on NBC's [[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today Show]] (http://www.today.com/video/today/51620316) and on [[MSNBC]], and current state of ethics in research at universities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/education/best-graduate-schools/top-engineering-schools/articles/2012/05/31/ethics-courses-trending-at-graduate-engineering-schools?page=2 U.S. News &amp; World Report]&lt;/ref&gt; He began his professional career in the Kansas City regional office of the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] in 1976 and has worked in numerous other scientific venues since then.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/documents/vallero_daniel_sed.pdf Researcher page at EPA]&lt;/ref&gt; He directed the Science, Technology and Human Values Program at [[Duke University]] from 1997 to 2005. Beginning in 2005, he has been  adjunct Professor of  Engineering Ethics at  Duke University, with a joint appointment in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, and  the Trinity School of Arts and Sciences. He held appointments also at the [[University of Missouri-Kansas City]], [[North Carolina Central University]], and as science staff member on Energy and Power Subcommittee of the [[United States House of Representatives]].
 
In his books and other writings, Vallero has taken the systems view of living systems, As such he has bridged [[biomedical engineering]] with [[environmental engineering]]. He stresses the need to incorporate the [[social sciences]] into every engineering and design project.  As a leader in [[engineering ethics]], he has served the [[National Academy of Engineering]] as a member of the Online Ethics Committee and the Executive Board of the National Institute of Engineering Ethics. Vallero has also advised [[Sigma Xi]], universities and other institutions on science and [[research ethics]] and the responsible conduct of research (RCR).

Vallero is editor for the [[Institution of Chemical Engineers]]' journal, ''Process Safety and Environmental Protection'', as well as the [[MDPI]] journal, ''Sustainability''. He is also the environmental engineering subject editor of the [[McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science &amp; Technology]] and the ''McGraw-Hill Yearbook of Science &amp; Technology''.

== Works ==

Vallero is a pioneer of [[green engineering]] and the application of [[life cycle analysis]] to engineering design. He was among the first to question the sustainability and ethics of using corn as a source of ethanol fuel. His reasoning was that current farming practice's dependence on fossil fuels needed to grow (including fertilizer and pesticides), harvest and ferment the corn is highly inefficient thermodynamically. The use of corn for fuel is especially problematic, since only the seed are used, not to mention the misuse of an important part of the global food supply.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008). Teaching green engineering: The case of ethanol life cycle analysis. Bulletin of
Science, Technology &amp; Society. 28 (3): 236-243.&lt;/ref&gt; Vallero argued that other crops are much more sustainable, especially those that make use of the whole plant, including cellulosic material, like [[switchgrass]] (Panicum virgatum).

In the book, "DUST: The inside Story of its Role in the September 11th Aftermath," &lt;ref&gt;P.J. Lioy (2010). DUST: The Inside Story of Its Role in the September 11th Aftermath (Forward By Tom Kean). Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield. {{ISBN|1-4422-0148-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the late American scientist [[Paul Lioy]] credited Vallero with leading the way to sampling of hazardous air pollutants in and around Ground Zero following the [[9/11]] attacks on the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. Lioy collaborated with Vallero in establishing a protocol for characterizing exposure in risk assessments following such emergencies. Lioy and Vallero coined the term “5 R’s” to delineate how exposure assessment varies during the five stages following a disaster: 1. Rescue; 2. Recovery; 3. Reentry; 4. Restoration; and 5. Rehabitation.&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero  and P. Lioy (2012). The 5-R’s: Reliable Post-Disaster Exposure Assessment. Leadership and Management and Engineering. 12 (4):  247-253. (October 2012). {{DOI|10.1061/(ASCE)LM.1943-5630.0000200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With architect, Chris Brasier, Vallero coined the term "synthovation," as a new design process for green engineering and [[green architecture]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Vallero and C. Brasier (2008), Sustainable Design: The Science of Sustainability and Green Engineering. John Wiley and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ, {{ISBN|0470130628}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of synthesis and innovation, sustainable design does not consider innovation to be an interruption (feedback loop) to the design process as in traditional "concept to completion" design. Rather, innovations are to be expected and integrated. Differing from the traditional step-wise process, synthovation is a spiral, dynamic, and continuously moving process toward completion of the design and throughout the life of the project, including end-of life recycling and design for disassembly, a component of [[design for environment]] (DfE), with innovations added along the way that will increase the [[sustainability]] of the project over its entire [[Enterprise life cycle|life cycle]].

In her book, "Hormone Deception",&lt;ref&gt;L. Berkson (2010), Hormone Deception. CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition, {{ISBN|1453741275}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindsey Berkson credits Vallero as among the first to apply [[exposure science]] to [[endocrine disruptors]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8548">'''Design-based learning''' ('''DBL'''), also known as '''design-based instruction''', is an [[inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based]] form of learning, or [[pedagogy]], that is based on integration of [[design thinking]] and the [[design process]] into the classroom at the [[K-12]] and [[post-secondary]] levels.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1"&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/inquiry-project-learning-research Powerful Learning: Studies Show Deep Understanding Derives from Collaborative Methods, By Brigid Barron, Linda Darling-Hammond, in Edutopia, October 8, 2008].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ldt.stanford.edu/~educ39109/POMI/DBL/ ''Design-based learning (DBL) to Innovate STEM Education,'' Stanford University].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  Design-based [[learning environment]]s can be found across many disciplines, including those traditionally associated with design (e.g. art, architecture, engineering, interior design, graphic design), as well as others not normally considered to be design-related (science, technology, business, humanities).&lt;ref name="Edutopia2"&gt;[http://www.edutopia.org/pdfs/edutopia-teaching-for-meaningful-learning.pdf ''Teaching for meaningful learning,'' Edutopia].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://anneburdick.com/Design-wo-Designers/Burdick_Design_wo_Designers.pdf ''Design Without Designers,'' Diane Burdick, May 2009].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;  DBL, as well as [[project-based learning]] and [[problem-based learning]], is used to teach [[21st century skills]] such as [[communication]] and [[collaboration]] and foster [[deeper learning]].&lt;ref name="KSBE"&gt;[http://www.ksbe.edu/_assets/spi/pdfs/21_century_skills_full.pdf  ''21st Century Skills - for Students and Teachers'', Research and Evaluation, August 2010, Kamehameha Schools].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeper learning is supported when students design and create an artifact that requires understanding and application of knowledge. DBL activity supports [[iteration]] as students create, assess, and redesign their projects. The work's complexity often requires collaboration and specialized roles, providing students with the opportunity to become “experts” in a particular area.  Design projects require students to establish goals and constraints, generate ideas, and create prototypes through [[storyboarding]] or other representational practices.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt; [[Robotics]] competitions in schools are popular design-based learning activities, wherein student teams design, build and then pilot their robots in competitive challenges. 
 
Design-based learning was developed in the 1980s by Doreen Nelson, a professor at [[California State Polytechnic University, Pomona]] and the [[Art Center College of Design]]. Her findings suggested that [[Kinesthetic learning|kinesthetic problem-solving]] helps students acquire, retain, and synthesize information in practical ways.&lt;ref&gt;[https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/partnerships-grants/tiip/showcase/virgil-project-portfolio/design-based-learning Design based learning, UCLA].

==Design process==
{{main article|Design process}}
The design process is an iterative process that has a variety of sequential steps:&lt;ref name="Mehalik"&gt;[http://www.lrdc.pitt.edu/Schunn/research/papers/MehaliketalJEE2008.pdf ''Middle-School Science Through Design- Based Learning versus Scripted Inquiry: Better Overall Science Concept Learning and Equity Gap Reduction'', Mehalik, Doppelt, Schunn.

[[File:ADDIE Model of Design.jpg|right|thumb|300px|ADDIE Model]]
A similar approach is the [[ADDIE Model]] of [[instructional design]], a framework of generic processes used by instructional designers and [[Training and development|training developers]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Gary R. Designing Effective Instruction, 6th Edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It represents a descriptive guideline with five distinct phases:
* Analysis
* Design
* Development
* Implementation
* Evaluation

==Results==
Positive benefits of the design-based learning approach have been observed, including student-based learning where students (often) identify their project's needs, develop their own ideas, and engage in a larger range of thinking than with the traditional scripted inquiry model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt; The results from the 2008 study by Mehalik et al. found significant improvement in student performance using the DBL model compared to the scripted model.&lt;ref name="Mehalik" /&gt;  A 1998 study (Fraser, Fraser &amp; Tobin, 1991) suggest that DBL has the potential to increase students’ desire to learn, enhance success in science class, and increase  interest in science topics. Students were observed to be engaged in DBL and the lower-achieving students were able to explain concepts at higher levels than previously observed by their teacher. In-depth experience in design activities and creation of meaningful outcomes in technology were observed in terms of the finished product, documentation, and reflection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v19n2/doppelt ''Engagement and Achievements:  A Case Study of Design-Based Learning in a Science Context,'' Doppelt, Mehalik, Schunn, Silk, Krysinski].  Retrieved 2016-03-15&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Significant benefits of implementing DBL has been observed in the areas of math and science (Darling-Hammond et al., 2008).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;  Research has found that students who participate in learning by design projects have a more systematic understanding of a system’s parts and functions that control groups (Hmelo, Holton, &amp; Kolodner, 2000).&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt;

A 2000 study (Hmelo, Holton, and Kolodner) found that the design project led to better learning outcomes and included deeper learning than the traditional learning approach. The researchers also noted that the students developed greater understanding of complex systems.  The study found that in using DBL, both higher-achieving and lower-achieving students showed strong evidence of progress in learning the targeted concepts, students were able to apply key concepts in their work, and there were positive effects on motivation and sense of ownership over work product by both groups and individual students.&lt;ref name="Edutopia1" /&gt;

==Implementation==
The teaching of [[21st century skills]] is more effective when teachers gain expertise in both the practice and the teaching of these skills, in effect becoming successful 21st century learners in the areas of:  communication and collaboration amongst teachers and with students; being flexible with new classroom dynamics; fostering independent student learning; adapting teaching and learning styles to new pedagogical approaches.

Challenges to implementing DBL include developing the skills of the instructors:&lt;ref name="KSBE" /&gt; 
* teachers' ability to select topics and activities that support, and benefit from, differing viewpoints and students' real-world experiences 
* selecting students who will work well together
* setting of effective ground rules to ensure equal opportunities to participate, 
* encouraging multiple strategies to foster full participation for all members of a group of team.

'''The Documentation Centre for Music''' (DOMUS), at the [[Stellenbosch University Music Library]], has its origins in the work and interests of staff and students at the Department of Music at [[Stellenbosch University]].  These include, at various times, academic staff members and Music library staff.  The existence of this Centre on a more formal basis is due to the efforts of [[Prof. Stephanus Muller]], and funding provided by the Stellenbosch University Music Department and the Vice-rector Research at Stellenbosch University.  In August 2005 an [[archivist]] Santie de Jong was appointed to sort and maintain the archive's various collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=De Jong|first=Santie|year=2015|title=Armed with a light bulb at the end of a chord: The ten-year journey of DOMUS|url=|journal=Fontes Artis Musicae|volume=62:3|pages=212–221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aims of DOMUS'''
&lt;br /&gt;
DOMUS aims to collect, conserve/preserve, sort, and catalogue, for the benefit of research on [[postgraduate]] level, the literary estates of [[composer]]s, [[performer]]s and [[musicologist]]s, as well as documentation collections of music institutions. Moreover, DOMUS aims to produce "strategic projects" such as recordings, publications and exhibitions "to maintain the expressive cultures represented in these collections as an important part of a broad South African heritage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.domus.ac.za/content/view/13/27/|title=www.domus.ac.za {{!}} Vision {{!}} Music, South, Collections, Africa, Research|last=Administrator|website=www.domus.ac.za|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Downhill creep''', also known as '''soil creep''' or commonly just '''creep''', is the slow [[Mass wasting|downward progression]] of [[rock (geology)|rock]] and [[soil]] down a low [[Grade (slope)|grade]] slope; it can also refer to slow deformation of such materials as a result of prolonged pressure and stress. Creep may appear to an observer to be continuous, but it really is the sum of numerous minute, discrete movements of slope material caused by the force of [[gravity]]. Friction, being the primary force to resist gravity, is produced when one body of material slides past another offering a mechanical resistance between the two which acts to hold objects (or slopes) in place. As slope on a hill increases, the gravitational force that is perpendicular to the slope decreases and results in less friction between the material that could cause the slope to slide.

==Overview==
{{unreferenced section|date = August 2013}}
The rate of soil creep down a slope depends on the steepness (gradient) of the slope, water absorption and content, type of sediment and material, and lastly vegetation. The rate of creep will take into account all of these factors to decide whether or not the hillside will progress downward. Creep is what is responsible for the rounded shape of hillsides.
[[File:Victorian_headstones,_England.JPG|right|thumb|A group of Victorian [[headstone]]s, [[England]]. Soil creep has led to the headstones being tilted at an angle over time.]]
Water is a very important factor when discussing soil deformation and movement. For instance, a sandcastle will only stand up when it is made with damp sand. The water offers cohesion to the sand which binds the sand particles together. However, pouring water over the sandcastle destroys it. This is because the presence of too much water fills the pores between the grains with water creating a slip plane between the particles and offering no cohesion causing them to slip and slide away. This holds true for hillsides and creep as well. The presence of water may help the hillside stay put and give it cohesion, but in a very wet environment or during or after a large amount of precipitation the pores between the grains can become saturated with water and cause the ground to slide along the slip plane it creates.

[[Image:Hillside moving over a sidewalk.jpg|thumb|Creep has caused the soil to spread over this pavement.]]
Creep can also be caused by the expansion of materials such as [[clay]] when they are exposed to water. Clay expands when wet, then contracts after drying. The expansion portion pushes downhill, then the contraction results in consolidation at the new offset.

Objects resting on top of the soil are carried by it as it descends down the slope. This can be seen in churchyards, where older [[headstones]] are often situated at an angle and several metres away from where they were originally erected.

Vegetation plays a role with slope stability and creep. When a hillside contains many trees, ferns, and shrubs their roots create an interlocking network that can strengthen unconsolidated material. They also aid in absorbing the excess water in the soil to help keep the slope stable. However, they do add to the weight of the slope giving gravity that much more of a driving force to act on in pushing the slope downward. In general, though, slopes without vegetation have a greater chance of movement.

Design engineers sometimes need to guard against downhill creep during their planning to prevent building [[foundation (architecture)|foundations]] from being undermined. Pilings are planted sufficiently deep into the surface material to guard against this behavior.

==Modeling regolith diffusion==
For shallow to moderate slopes, diffusional sediment flux is modeled linearly as (Culling, 1960; McKean et al., 1993)

&lt;math&gt;q_s = k_d S \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k_d\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the diffusion constant, and &lt;math&gt;S\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is slope.  For steep slopes, diffusional sediment flux is more appropriately modeled as a non-linear function of slope&lt;ref name="Roering1999" /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;q_s = \frac{k_d S}{1 - (S/S_c)^2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;S_c\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the critical gradient for sliding of dry soil.

On long timescales, diffusive creep in hillslope soils leads to a characteristic rounding of ridges in the landscape.&lt;ref name="Roering1999"&gt;Roering, Joshua J., James W. Kirchner, and William E. Dietrich. "Evidence for nonlinear, diffusive sediment transport on hillslopes and implications for landscape morphology." Water Resources Research 35.3 (1999): 853–70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosenbloom, N. A., and Robert S. Anderson. "Hillslope and channel evolution in a marine terraced landscape, Santa Cruz." California: Journal of Geophysical Research 99.B7 (1994): 14-013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electric Power Research Institute''', Inc. or '''EPRI''', is an American independent, [[Nonprofit organization|nonprofit]] organization that conducts research and development related to the [[Electricity generation|generation]], delivery, and use of [[electricity]] to help address challenges in electricity, including reliability, efficiency, affordability, health, safety, and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epri.com/#/about/epri?lang=en|title=EPRI Public Site|website=www.epri.com|language=en|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EPRI's principal offices and laboratories are located in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]], California; [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]], N.C.; [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]], TN; and [[Lenox, Massachusetts|Lenox]], MA.

==History==
In November 1965, the [[Northeast blackout of 1965|Great Northeastern Blackout]] left 30 million people in the United States without electricity. Historic in scale and impact, it demonstrated the nation's growing dependence upon electricity and its vulnerability to power loss. The event marked a watershed moment for the U.S. [[Electricity sector of the United States|electricity sector]] and triggered the creation of the Electric Power Research Institute.

Following the blackout, leaders in [[United States Congress|Congress]] held hearings in the early 1970s about the lack of research supporting the power industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-08-05 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160819152610/http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf |archivedate=2016-08-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Chauncey Starr, then the Dean of the [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] [[UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering and Applied Science|School of Engineering and Applied Science]], led the initiative, proposed by Congress, to create an independent research and development organization to support the electricity sector and address its technical and operational challenges. In 1972, at a formal hearing of the [[U.S. Senate Commerce Committee]], Starr presented a vision for the Electric Power Research Institute to serve Congress's mandate for objective, scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Summer 2012|title=Born in a Blackout|url=http://mydocs.epri.com/docs/CorporateDocuments/EPRI_Journal/2012-Summer/1025689_Blackout.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starr served as the first President of EPRI for five years and formally retired at age 65, but continued to work at EPRI for the next 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barker|first=Brent|date=Spring 2012|title=The Man Who Never Stopped|url=http://eprijournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/1025049_Spring_online.pdf|journal=EPRI Journal|volume=1|pages=14–17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3305">A '''Fachwirt''' is a higher professional certification in [[Germany]] allocated to level 6 of the [[European Qualifications Framework]], where it was translated to Business Management Specialist. 

To facilitate appreciation of the Fachwirt internationally, the [[Association of German Chambers of Industry and Commerce]] (''Deutscher Industrie- und Handelskammertag'', DIHK) proposed ''Bachelor Professional'' as the English translation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frankfurt-main.ihk.de/imperia/md/content/pdf/berufsbildung/weiterbildung/Abschlusserlaeuterung_Bachelor_professional_englisch.pdf ''Bachelor professional CCI'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dihk.de/ressourcen/downloads/dihk_hrk_durchlaessigkeit.pdf |title=''Für mehr Durchlässigkeit zwischen beruflicher Bildung und Hochschulbildung!'' |access-date=2013-02-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602033525/http://www.dihk.de/ressourcen/downloads/dihk_hrk_durchlaessigkeit.pdf |archive-date=2013-06-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, due to the danger of confusion with academic degrees, this motion was rejected by the German state ministers of education. Yet, this has not stopped the IHK institutions from issuing certificates in English that show the title "Bachelor Professional" in big letters, with only a small note at the bottom of the page that it is not an university degree. However, owners of the certificate must be very careful not to come into conflict with § 132a Abs. 2 of the German criminal code by using the title in relation to someone located in Germany. Applying for a position solely outside of Germany with the certificate is arguably not affected, however (and is the original purpose of the translation). A legally grey area may be the use of the title on career networks on the Internet (which is actually quite common), where both German and foreign companies are targeted at the same time.

== Characteristics ==

The Fachwirt provides a form of [[continuing professional development]], which is usually pursued following an [[apprenticeship]] and at least one year of professional experience in a recognized occupation. The final examinations, regulated by the German Vocational Training Act, are carried out by specialized committees of the German [[Chamber of Commerce|Chambers of Commerce and Industry]] (DIHK). Learning objectives, defined by DIHK created frameworks, require knowledge in business administration as well as practical and theoretical skills in a particular industrial sector (e.g. ''Handelsfachwirt'' for Trade and Commerce, ''Verkehrsfachwirt'' for Transport Management, ''Fachwirt im Sozial- und Gesundheitswesen'' for Social and Health Services). 

Although not a prerequisite for admission to the final exams, training courses are offered by several, primarily private educational institutions. Depending on the specialization, the curricula suggest coursework of 400 to 800 hours, which is taught in 6 to 24 month of full-time or part-time study, respectively, comparable to almost a full term at university which carries 30 [[European_Credit_Transfer_and_Accumulation_System | ECTS]] representative of 900 hours of course work.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5975">The '''Faulkes Telescope Project''' (FTP) is supported by the  [[Dill Faulkes]] Educational Trust. It provides access to 1,500 hours of observing time on two 2-metre class telescopes located in Hawaii ([[Faulkes Telescope North]] in [[Hawaii]]) and Australia ([[Faulkes Telescope South]] in [[Australia]]). This time is dedicated to education and public outreach, mainly in the UK, but also for smaller, selected projects in [[Europe]] and the [[US]].  

FTP has operated a UK-wide educational programme since 2004, and currently works with science education projects across Europe and further afield (e.g. USA, Russia, Israel), including many EU-based science, maths and ICT programmes. FTP specialises in providing physics and maths education and outreach via astronomy and space science, utilising the unique access it can provide to research-grade facilities. The basic philosophy is to engage learners in “real science”, making them active participants in a range of astronomical research projects, ranging from observations of the solar system to distant galaxies. Teacher training (both face-to-face and online) is a core component of the FTP educational philosophy, and project staff have been involved in professional development work both in the UK and overseas, with teacher training days being held in Moscow, Santa Barbara, Munich, Lisbon, Paris and several other venues in Portugal and Spain.

FTP operates a broad range of educational programmes, with a strong emphasis on teacher training and engaging students with “real science”. A variety of research projects are currently being run on the FTs, with schools often participating in the role of data gatherers, particularly in long-term monitoring or short-term intensive studies or Target of Opportunity requests for transient objects (e.g. GRBs, supernovae, NEOs or X-ray systems in outburst).  

The project also provides extensive educational materials which can be accessed and downloaded free of charge from their educational resources website. These resources include astronomy video tutorials, online astronomy training, paper-based documents for use in the classroom, and pre-packaged data from the telescopes to use with the exercises detailed online.

==Robotic Telescopes==
The robotic telescopes used by the Faulkes Telescope Project are owned and operated by Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGTN). Users must register for an account via FTP and, providing they meet the criteria for an account (as explained on the FTP website), the account details will be emailed out to the registered user. Students and teachers can then go online and book time on the telescope and run their own 29-minute-long real-time observational session on one of the telescopes,  remotely controlling it over the internet.  These telescopes are the largest robotic telescopes in the world available for UK schools to control in real time.

The project was the winner of the 2008 [[Sir Arthur Clarke Award]] in the category of Achievement in Education.

The Faulkes Telescope  Projects in cooperation with [[Hands-On Universe]] runs many student observing projects such as supernovae observations, asteroid observations, the Lifecycle of Stars project and Hickson Compact Group of Galaxies project. Details of these, and many more projects can be found on the Faulkes educational website.

'''Frank Moore Cross, Jr.''' (July 13, 1921&amp;nbsp;– October 16, 2012) was the Hancock Professor of Hebrew and Other Oriental Languages Emeritus at [[Harvard University]], notable for his work in the interpretation of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], his 1973 [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]] ''Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic'', and his work in [[Northwest Semitic]] [[epigraphy]]. Many of his essays on the latter topic have since been collected in ''Leaves from an Epigrapher's Notebook''.

==Early life and education==
Cross was the son of Frank Moore Cross, a long-time pastor of Ensley Highland Presbyterian Church in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. One of his uncles, the Rev. [[Laurance L. Cross]], was Mayor of [[Berkeley, California]] from 1947 to 1955.

Cross graduated from [[Ensley High School]] in 1938.&lt;ref name=Garrison-2010&gt;Garrison, Greg (March 20, 2010) "Old Ensley Highland Presbyterian organ reclaimed from empty church." ''Birmingham News''&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] from [[Maryville College]] in 1942 and a [[Bachelor of Divinity|BD]] from [[McCormick Theological Seminary]], where he was awarded the Nettie F. McCormick Fellowship in Old Testament Studies, in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Baruch Halpern and Jon D. Levenson, eds. ''Traditions in Transformation: Turning Points in Biblical Faith'', (Winona Lake, Ind.: Eisenbrauns, 1981), 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Cross went on to study under [[William F. Albright]], the founding father of [[Biblical Archaeology]], at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he received a [[PhD]] in 1950. He also received an [[Master of Arts|MA]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1958. Cross was awarded a [[DPhil]] from the [[Hebrew University]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 1984 and a [[DSc]] from the [[University of Lethbridge]] in 1990.

==Career==
From 1949–1950 Cross was a Junior Instructor in [[Semitic languages]] at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He was subsequently an instructor in Biblical History at [[Wellesley College]] from 1950–1951, an instructor in [[Old Testament]] at [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] 1951–1953, and an [[Associate Professor]] at the same institution from 1954-1957.

Cross was appointed Associate Professor in [[Old Testament]] at [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1957. One year later, he was appointed [[Harvard University]]'s Hancock [[Professor]] of [[Hebrew]] and Other Oriental Languages, the third oldest university chair in the United States. He would hold this position from 1958–1992, then becoming Hancock Professor [[Emeritus]]. Cross was Curator of the [[Harvard Semitic Museum]] from 1958–1961 and Director of the Museum from 1974–1987.

Cross was a Fellow of the [[American Council of Learned Societies]] (1971–1972), a Fellow of the Institute for Advanced Studies at the [[Hebrew University]] of [[Jerusalem]] (1978–1979), a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], and a Member of the [[American Philosophical Society]].

During his tenure at Harvard, Cross supervised more than a hundred dissertations, with the result that many of today's senior scholars in Hebrew Bible and Ancient Near Eastern studies are his former students. Among the most prominent of these are [[Emanuel Tov]], [[John J. Collins]], [[Jo Ann Hackett]], John Huehnergard, [[William G. Dever]], [[P. Kyle McCarter, Jr.]], Peter Machinist, [[Lawrence Stager]], [[Bruce Waltke]], [[Richard Elliott Friedman]], [[Hector Avalos]], and [[Mark S. Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bib-arch.org/news/frank-cross-birthday.asp Happy Birthday, Frank Cross] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103131508/http://www.bib-arch.org/news/frank-cross-birthday.asp |date=2011-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dead Sea Scrolls==
Beginning June 1953, Cross was a member of the international committee responsible for editing the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]], which had been discovered at [[Qumran]]. Cross first heard of the scrolls in late 1948 while a student at [[Johns Hopkins University]], when he was shown pictures of the [[Isaiah scroll|Isaiah Scroll]] by [[William F Albright|Albright]], who would later nominate Cross to the Scrolls editorial team.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, S., (2014). Frank Moore Cross's Contribution to the Study of the Dead Sea Scrolls. American Schools of Oriental Research, 183.&lt;/ref&gt; On joining the team he was immediately allocated 61 Biblical [[manuscripts]] from Cave 4 at Qumran to prepare for publication. Initially, this involved cleaning the manuscripts in the [[Palestine Archaeological Museum]] where they were being worked on in the 'Scrollery'. As with several others on the team, Cross was financially supported between 1954 and 1960 by a [[John D Rockefeller]] subsidy. Cross was one of only two [[Americans|American]] scholars on the scroll-publication team, and he has since been recognized as a founder of Qumran studies. His general introduction to the topic is ''The Ancient Library of Qumran'', the third edition of which was published in 1995.

==Death==
Cross died in Rochester, New York in October 2012 after a long illness. He was 91.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yardley |first=William |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/20/us/frank-moore-cross-biblical-scholar-and-dead-sea-scrolls-interpreter-dies-at-91.html |title= ''Frank Moore Cross, Biblical Scholar, Dies at 91 |publisher=nytimes.com |date=2012-10-19 |accessdate=2012-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
In 1980, Cross received the Percia Schimmel Prize in [[Archaeology]] from the [[Israel Museum]] and the [[William Foxwell Albright]] Award in [[Biblical]] Scholarship. In 1991 he was awarded the Medalla de Honor de la Universidad Complutense ([[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]]), the [[Gratz College]] Centennial Award in 1998 and a Lifetime Award in Textual Studies from the National Foundation for Jewish Culture in 2004.

Cross was an Honorary Member of the [[Israel Exploration Society]] and the [[United Kingdom|British]] Society for Old Testament Study. He was a [[trustee]] of the [[American Schools of Oriental Research]] (1973–1991), and an Honorary Trustee from 1991; a Trustee of the Ancient Biblical Manuscript Center (1979–1996) and a Lifetime Honorary Trustee from 1997; and a Trustee of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] Foundation since 1992.

==Education and career==
Daily received her B.S. in biological sciences from [[Stanford University]] in 1986. She then went on to earn her M.S. in biological sciences at Stanford University in 1987 and received her Ph.D. in biological sciences from Stanford University in 1992.&lt;ref name=biog&gt;{{cite web|title=Gretchen Daily {{!}} Stanford Woods Institute|url=http://woods.stanford.edu/about/woods-faculty/gretchen-daily|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Daily was awarded the Winslow/Heinz Postdoctoral Fellow at [[UC Berkeley]]'s Energy and Resources Group.&lt;ref name=cv&gt;{{cite web|last=Daily|first=Gretchen|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/viewCV?facultyId=6214&amp;name=Gretchen_Daily|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=6 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130612144302/http://med.stanford.edu/profiles/viewCV?facultyId=6214&amp;name=Gretchen_Daily|archivedate=12 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995 Daily became a Bing Interdisciplinary Research Scientist in the Department of Biological Sciences at [[Stanford University]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; During her time as a research scientist, Daily served as the editor for ''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems'', which provides examples of the benefits that ecosystems can provide for societies and ideas for how to quantify the value of these services. The Heinz Foundation noted that ''Nature's Services'' "has served as a model for ecosystems regulation in several regions of the world and was a catalyst for the U.N.'s Millennium Ecosystem Assessment." After 7 years as a research scientist, Daily was appointed as an associate professor in the Department of Biological Sciences and as a senior fellow at the Institute of International Studies (both at Stanford University) in 2002.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; In 2002, Daily also co-wrote the book ''The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable'' with [[Katherine Ellison]].&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

In 2005, Daily was appointed as the Bing Professor of Environmental Science in the Department of Biology at Stanford University, a senior fellow at the [[Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment]] and was made the director of the Center for Conservation Biology at Stanford University.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; As of 2013, Daily still holds all three of these positions.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

In 2005 Daily (the project leader from Stanford), along with partners at [[The Nature Conservancy]], [[the University of Minnesota]], and the [[World Wildlife Fund]], established the Natural Capital Project. The organization's stated goal is to "improve the state of biodiversity and human well-being by motivating greater and more cost-effective investments in both."&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=ncp1&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Project - About|url=http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/about.html#mission|publisher=Natural Capital Project|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As one of the directors of the Natural Capital Project, Daily "serves as [the organization's] chief emissary to financial and government leaders."&lt;ref name=ncp2&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Capital Project - People|url=http://www.naturalcapitalproject.org/people.html#directors|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Daily became a member of the board of directors of the Nature Conservancy. Daily served as the inaugural [[Humanitas Programme|Humanitas]] Visiting Professor in Sustainability Studies at the [[University of Cambridge]] in 2013.

==Awards==
Daily has received numerous prestigious awards and honors throughout her academic career, including the 21st Century Scientist Award (2000), The [[Sophie Prize]] (2008), The [[International Cosmos Prize]] (2009), The 16th Annual [[Heinz Award]] with special focus on global change, the Midori Prize (2010), the [[Volvo Environment Prize]] (2012), and the [[Blue Planet Prize]] (2017).&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=2012prize&gt;{{cite web|title=Valuation of natural capital awarded 2012 Volvo Environment Prize|url=http://www.volvogroup.com/group/global/en-gb/investors/_layouts/CWP.Internet.VolvoCom/NewsItem.aspx?News.ItemId=129904&amp;News.Language=en-gb|publisher=Volvo Group|accessdate=2013-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Heinz Awards: Gretchen Daily|url=http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/gretchen-daily|website=The Heinz Awards|publisher=The Heinz Awards|accessdate=August 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental work earns Gretchen Daily the Blue Planet Prize|url=https://news.stanford.edu/2017/10/19/gretchen-daily-collects-blue-planet-prize/|website=Stanford News|publisher=Stanford University|accessdate=December 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research area==
Daily's academic profile at the Center for Conservation Biology states that "Daily’s scientific research is on countryside biogeography and the future dynamics of biodiversity change."&lt;ref name=woodsprofile&gt;{{cite web|title=Gretchen Daily|url=http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/cgi-bin/ccb/content/gretchen-daily|publisher=Woods Institute|accessdate=2013-10-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029233723/http://www.stanford.edu/group/CCB/cgi-bin/ccb/content/gretchen-daily/|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In an interview, Daily remarked that "'Countryside biogeography' is a new conceptual framework for elucidating the fates of populations, species, and ecosystems in ‘countryside’ – the growing fraction of Earth's unbuilt land surface whose ecosystem qualities are strongly influenced by humanity."&lt;ref name=interviewconservationbytes&gt;{{cite web|last=Bradshaw|first=CJA|title=Conservation Scholars: Gretchen Daily|url=http://conservationbytes.com/2008/09/27/conservation-scholars-gretchen-daily/|publisher=Conservation Bytes|accessdate=2013-10-27|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029214720/http://conservationbytes.com/2008/09/27/conservation-scholars-gretchen-daily/|archivedate=2013-10-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using findings from research done in countryside biogeography, Daily, and researchers like her, is attempting to determine what "species are most important and most merit protection" and "what is the scientific basis for deciding" the relative importance of species within a given ecosystem.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt; When asked "which species/systems most merit protection?" Daily responded that she is "actively attempting to link projected changes in biodiversity and ecosystems to changes in 'services' to humanity." She went on to cite "production of goods," "life-support processes,"  "life-fulfilling conditions" and "options (genetic diversity for future use)" as the services that ecosystems/species provide for humans. 
 
As one of the co-founders of the Natural Capital Project, Daily employs her research practically by working "with private landowners, economists, lawyers, business people, and government agencies to incorporate environmental issues into business practice and public policy."&lt;ref name=biog/&gt;

==Publications==
Daily has authored, coauthored and/or edited five books. Daily has published more than 200 scientific and popular articles.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;&lt;ref name=biog/&gt; She has published articles in many prestigious journals, including ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'', ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' and ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.&lt;ref name=cv/&gt;

==''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems reviews''==
''Nature's Services: Societal Dependence on Natural Ecosystems'' was published in 1997 by [[Island Press]]. ''Nature's Services'' starts off with an introduction from Daily titled "What are Ecosystem Services" and another introductory piece by Harold Mooney and Paul Ehrlich that seeks to detail the "fragmentary history" of ecosystem services. After the introductions, the book is split into four distinct sections that address different elements of ecosystem services.

The first section of the book address the economic issues involved in assigning value to ecosystem services in the first place. The next two sections outline different kinds of services that can be provided by nature, "Overarching Services" and "Services Supplied by Major Biomes." The overarching services section includes papers like "Biodiversity and Ecosystem Functioning" by David Tilman,&lt;ref name=tilmanarticle&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|pages=93–112|url=http://cedarcreek.umn.edu/biblio/fulltext/t1183.pdf|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Ecosystem Services Supplied by Soil" by Daily, Pamela Matson and Peter Vitousek&lt;ref name=soilpaper&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|pages=113–132|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYJSziDfTjEC&amp;pg=PA113&amp;dq=Ecosystem+Services+Supplied+by+Soil#v=onepage&amp;q=Ecosystem%20Services%20Supplied%20by%20Soil&amp;f=false|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and "Services Provided by Pollinators" by Gary Nabhan and Stephen Buchmann&lt;ref name=nabhanarticle&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|pages=133–150|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Services Provided by Major Biomes" section includes papers regarding topics like "Marine Ecosystems" by Charles Peterson and Jane Lubchenco&lt;ref name=petersonandlubchenco&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|pages=177–194|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The World's Forests and their Ecosystem Services" by Norman Myers&lt;ref name=normanmyers&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|pages=215–236|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYJSziDfTjEC&amp;pg=PA215&amp;dq=The+World%27s+Forests+and+their+Ecosystem+Services#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20World's%20Forests%20and%20their%20Ecosystem%20Services&amp;f=false|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The last section of the book includes case studies which showcase different services that distinct ecosystems provide to people around the world. Examples include: "Water Quality Improvements by Wetlands" by Katherine Ewel&lt;ref name=katherineewelpaper&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|pages=329–344|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QYJSziDfTjEC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;dq=water+quality+improvements+by+wetlands#v=onepage&amp;q=water%20quality%20improvements%20by%20wetlands&amp;f=false|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Ecosystem Services in a Modern Economy: Gunnison County, Colorado" by Andrew Wilcox and John Harte.&lt;ref name=gunnisoncountypaper&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|pages=311–328|url=http://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/19991803940.html|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the conclusion of the book, Daily remarks that the "core analyses presented in this book attempt to value ecosystems and their component species only insofar as they confer benefits, in the form of life-support goods and services, to human beings" but that this "focus does not in any way preclude making decisions on the basis of other values as well."&lt;ref name=naturesservicesconclusion&gt;{{cite book|last=Daily|first=ed. by Gretchen C.|title=Nature's services : societal dependence on natural ecosystems|year=1997|publisher=Island Press|location=Washington, DC [u.a.]|isbn=1559634766|page=365|edition=[Nachdr.]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the book, James Salzman concluded that ''Nature's Services'', in contrast with efforts like the [[Endangered Species Act]], "takes a different, potentially more effective tack, calling for explicit recognition of ecosystem services because of the direct, tangible benefits they provide. Such recognition could provide a more integrated and compelling basis for action than those suggested by a single-species or biodiversity protection for the simple reason that the impacts of those services on humans are more immediate and undeniably important."&lt;ref name=valuingecosystemservices&gt;{{cite web|last=Salzman|first=James|title=Valuing Ecosystem Services|url=http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2238&amp;context=faculty_scholarship|accessdate=11-1-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable''==
''The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable'' was co-written by Daily and [[Katherine Ellison]] and was published on September 1, 2003, by [[Island Press]]. The book presents different cases studies where companies or governments were able to actually profit from their conservation efforts. One chapter describes how New York "decided to meet federal requirements to improve
water quality with a less expensive, though more controversial, option of protecting watershed integrity through land purchases and development limits, rather than adopt the technological solution of a multibillion dollar treatment facility."&lt;ref name=karrow/&gt; While another chapter offers "an assessment of plans to manage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by developing a worldwide system of carbon
trading patterned on the U.S. experience with pollution"&lt;ref name=karrow/&gt;

[[Kenneth Arrow]] remarked that Daily and Ellison "have delineated the new movement to make conservation of natural resources financially rewarding and illustrate in a lively and probing manner many cases of profitable activities that also preserve the biosphere."&lt;ref name=karrow&gt;{{cite web|title=The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable - Katherine Ellison|url=http://www.katherineellison.com/_p_style__font__14pt_18pt_garamond__georgia__serif_color__1175a4___the_new_econo_40610.htm|accessdate=6 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review of the book, Patrick Wilson stated that "The most notable contribution of ''The New Economy of Nature'' is its balanced message, optimistic and cautious." He goes on to say that the book "avoids the fallacy that the market is the solution to our environmental protection challenges and that, if allowed to operate free of government intervention, it can somehow make the policymaking choices less problematic and the tradeoffs less daunting" and that "it challenges elements of environmental orthodoxy that hold that the market, because of its short-term orientation and emphasis on profit over conservation, is an intrinsic threat to nature and the only solution is increased government oversight and financial commitment."&lt;ref name=nrj&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Patrick|title=The New Economy of Nature: The Quest to Make Conservation Profitable.

The '''Hans Kilian Award''' honors researchers whose outstanding scientific achievements provide a deeper insight into the historical and cultural existence of humankind and the changing human psyche.

The award was conceived by [[:de: Lotte Köhler|Lotte Köhler]] and established by the Köhler Foundation. It bears the name of the late social psychologist and psychoanalyst [[:de: Hans Kilian|Hans Kilian]] (1921-2008) and aims to foster his idea of an interdisciplinary social psychology and psychoanalysis as well as his concept of "metacultural humanization." This concept reflects the interactions between individual life history and broader sociohistorical developments and aims to integrate social and cultural psychological, psychoanalytic, anthropological, historical, and sociological perspectives.

In line with Hans Kilian's ideas, the award recognizes international scientific achievements that cross the boundaries between disciplines and cultures and create productive syntheses between previously isolated areas of knowledge. Desirable inter- and transdisciplinary perspectives combine theories, methods, and findings from a wide spectrum of disciplines including the humanities, the social sciences, and cultural studies, as well as psychiatry and other areas of medicine. Amounting to 80,000 euros, the Hans Kilian Award is one of the best-endowed social sciences awards in Europe. It is awarded every two years and was first awarded in 2011.

The award will be a central part of the activities of the [[Hans Kilian and Lotte Köhler Center]] (KKC) for Social and Cultural Scientific Psychology and Historical Anthropology which was founded by the Köhler Foundation in August 2014 and whose office and activities are based at the Chair of Social Theory and Social Psychology, Ruhr University Bochum, Germany.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="869">A '''headquarters unit''' is a specialised [[military unit]] formed around the [[headquarters]] of a  [[commanding officer]] and the requirements of that position. As such, a headquarters unit is always a component of a larger unit.

Examples include:
* headquarters [[regiment]], which usually controls a brigade, division or larger unit;
* headquarters [[battalion]]  (controlling a regiment, brigade or larger unit);
* headquarters [[company (military unit)]] (controlling a battalion);
* headquarters [[platoon]] (controlling a company) 

Specific examples include:
* [[Headquarters and Headquarters Company|Headquarters and Headquarters Company (US Army)]]
* [[Headquarters and Service Company]] (US Marine Corps)

The '''history of the polymerase chain reaction''' (PCR) has variously been described as a classic [[Eureka (word)|"Eureka!"]] moment,&lt;ref name=MullisLecture&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1993/mullis-lecture.html Kary Mullis' Nobel Lecture, December 8, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; or as an example of cooperative teamwork between disparate researchers.&lt;ref name=Rabinow&gt;Rabinow P "Making PCR: A Story of Biotechnology" University of Chicago Press (1996) {{ISBN|0-226-70147-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following is a list of events before, during, and after its development:

==Prelude==
* On '''April 25, 1953''' [[James D. Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] published "a radically different structure" for [[DNA]],&lt;ref&gt;Watson JD, Crick FHC "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid", Nature vol. 171, pp. 737–738 (1953).  [http://www.exploratorium.edu/origins/coldspring/ideas/printit.html]&lt;/ref&gt; thereby founding the field of [[molecular genetics]].  Their [[Molecular structure of Nucleic Acids|structural model]] featured two strands of [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] [[Base pair|base-paired]] DNA, running in opposite directions as a double helix.  They concluded their report saying that "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".  For this insight they were awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in '''1962'''.
* Starting in the '''mid-1950s''', [[Arthur Kornberg]] began to study the mechanism of [[DNA replication]].&lt;ref&gt;(Arthur Kornberg's Discovery of DNA Polymerase I) J. Biol. Chem. vol. 280, p. 46. [http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/full/280/49/e46]&lt;/ref&gt;  By '''1957''' he has identified the first [[DNA polymerase]].&lt;ref&gt;Lehman, IR, Bessman MJ, Simms ES, Kornberg A "Enzymatic Synthesis of Deoxyribonucleic Acid. I. Preparation of Substrates and Partial Purification of an Enzyme from Escherichia coli" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 233(1) pp. 163–170 (1958).&lt;/ref&gt;  The enzyme was limited, creating DNA in just one direction and requiring an existing [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] to initiate copying of the template strand.  Overall, the DNA replication process is surprisingly complex, requiring separate proteins to [[DNA helicase|open]] the DNA helix, to [[Single-strand binding protein|keep]] it open, to create [[Primase|primers]], to [[DNA polymerase III holoenzyme|synthesize]] new DNA, to [[DNA polymerase I|remove]] the primers, and to [[DNA ligase|tie]] the pieces all together.  Kornberg was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in '''1959'''.
* In the '''early 1960s''' [[H. Gobind Khorana]] made significant advances in the elucidation of the [[genetic code]].  Afterwards, he initiated a large project to [[Gene synthesis|totally synthesize]] a functional human [[gene]].&lt;ref&gt;Khorana HG et al. "Total synthesis of the structural gene for the precursor of a tyrosine suppressor transfer RNA from Escherichia coli. 1. General introduction" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 251(3) pp. 565–70 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt;  To achieve this, Khorana pioneered many of the techniques needed to make and use [[Oligonucleotide synthesis|synthetic]] DNA [[oligonucleotide]]s.  Sequence-specific oligonucleotides were used both as building blocks for the gene, and as primers and templates for DNA polymerase.  In '''1968''' Khorana was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] for his work on the Genetic Code.
* In '''1969''' [[Thomas D. Brock]] reported the isolation of a new species of [[bacterium]] from a [[hot spring]] in [[Yellowstone National Park]].  ''[[Thermus aquaticus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Brock TD, Freeze H "Thermus aquaticus, a Nonsporulating Extreme Thermophile" J. Bacteriol. vol. 98(1) pp. 289–297 (1969).&lt;/ref&gt; (Taq), became a standard source of enzymes able to withstand higher temperatures than those from ''[[Escherichia coli|E. Coli]]''.
* In '''1970''' Klenow reported a modified version of DNA Polymerase I from ''E. coli''.&lt;ref&gt;Klenow H and Henningsen I "Selective Elimination of the Exonuclease Activity of the Deoxyribonucleic Acid Polymerase from Escherichia coli B by Limited Proteolysis" Proc Natl Acad Sci vol. 65 pp. 168–75 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt;  Treatment with a protease removed the 'forward' nuclease activity of this enzyme.  The overall activity of the resulting [[Klenow fragment]] is therefore biased towards the synthesis of DNA, rather than its degradation.
* By '''1971''' researchers in Khorana's project, concerned over their yields of DNA, began looking at "repair synthesis" – an artificial system of primers and templates that allows DNA polymerase to copy segments of the gene they are synthesizing.  Although similar to PCR in using repeated applications of DNA polymerase, the process they usually describe&lt;ref name=Khorana1&gt;Panet A, Khorana HG "Studies on Polynucleotides" J. Biol. Chem. vol. 249(16), pp. 5213–21 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt; employs just a single primer-template complex, and therefore would not lead to the exponential amplification seen in PCR.
* Circa '''1971''' [[Kjell Kleppe]], a researcher in Khorana's lab, envisioned a process very similar to PCR.  At the end of a paper on the earlier technique,&lt;ref name=Kleppe&gt;Kleppe K, Ohtsuka E, Kleppe R, Molineux I, Khorana HG "Studies on polynucleotides. XCVI. Repair replications of short synthetic DNA's as catalyzed by DNA polymerases." J. Molec. Biol. vol. 56, pp. 341–61 (1971).&lt;/ref&gt; he described how a two-primer system might lead to replication of a specific segment of DNA:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:::''"one would hope to obtain two structures, each containing the full length of the template strand appropriately complexed with the primer. DNA polymerase will be added to complete the process of repair replication. Two molecules of the original duplex should result. The whole cycle could be repeated, there being added every time a fresh dose of the enzyme."'' &lt;ref name=Kleppe/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:No results are shown there, and the mention of unpublished experiments in another paper&lt;ref name=Khorana1/&gt; may (or may not) refer to the two-primer replication system. (These early precursors to PCR were carefully scrutinized in a patent lawsuit, and are discussed in Mullis' chapters in ''The Polymerase Chain Reaction'' (1994).&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB, Ferré F, Gibbs RA "The Polymerase Chain Reaction" Birkhäuser Press (1994) {{ISBN|0-8176-3750-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

* Also in '''1971''', [[Cetus Corporation]] was founded in [[Berkeley, California]] by Ronald Cape, Peter Farley, and Donald Glaser.  Initially the company screened for microorganisms capable of producing components used in the manufacture of food, chemicals, vaccines, or pharmaceuticals. After moving to nearby [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], they began projects involving the new [[Genetic engineering|biotechnology]] industry, primarily the [[Recombinant DNA|cloning]] and [[Gene expression|expression]] of human genes, but also the development of diagnostic tests for genetic mutations.
* In '''1976''' a [[Taq polymerase|DNA polymerase]]&lt;ref name=Chien&gt;Chien A, Edgar DB, Trela JM "Deoxyribonucleic acid polymerase from the extreme thermophile Thermus aquaticus" J. Bacteriol. vol. 174 pp. 1550–1557 (1976).&lt;/ref&gt; was isolated from [[Thermus aquaticus|''T. aquaticus'']]. It was found to retain its activity at temperatures above 75&amp;nbsp;°C.
* In '''1977''' [[Frederick Sanger]] reported a [[Chain termination method|method]] for determining the sequence of DNA.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger F, Nicklen S, Coulson AR "DNA sequencing with chain-terminating inhibitors" Proc Natl Acad Sci vol. 74(12) pp. 5463–7 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;  The technique employed an oligonucleotide [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]], DNA polymerase, and modified [[Dideoxynucleotide|nucleotide precursors]] that block further extension of the primer in sequence-dependent manner.  For this innovation he was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry|Nobel Prize]] in '''1980'''.

By '''1980''' all of the components needed to perform PCR amplification were known to the scientific community.  The use of DNA polymerase to extend oligonucleotide primers was a common procedure in DNA sequencing and the production of [[Complementary DNA|cDNA]] for [[Recombinant DNA|cloning]] and [[Gene expression|expression]].  The use of DNA polymerase for [[nick translation]] was the most common method used to label [[Hybridization probe|DNA probes]] for [[Southern blot]]ting.

== Theme ==
* In '''1979''' [[Cetus Corporation]] hired [[Kary Mullis]] to synthesize oligonucleotides for various research and development projects throughout the company.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1&gt;Mullis KB "The Unusual Origins of the Polymerase Chain Reaction" Scientific American, vol. 262, pp. 56–65 (April 1990).&lt;/ref&gt; These oligos were used as probes for screening cloned genes, as primers for DNA sequencing and cDNA synthesis, and as building blocks for gene construction. Originally synthesizing these oligos by hand, Mullis later evaluated early prototypes for automated synthesizers.&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt;
* By '''May 1983''' Mullis synthesized oligonucleotide probes for a project at Cetus to analyze a [[sickle cell anemia]] mutation. Hearing of problems with their work, Mullis proposed an alternative technique based on Sanger's [[Chain termination method|DNA sequencing]] method.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1/&gt; Realizing the difficulty in making the Sanger method specific to a single location in the genome, Mullis then modified the idea to add a second primer on the opposite strand. Repeated applications of polymerase could lead to a chain reaction of replication for a specific segment of the genome – PCR.
* Later in '''1983''' Mullis began to test his idea. His first experiment&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; did not involve thermal cycling – he hoped that the polymerase could perform continued replication on its own. Later experiments that year included repeated thermal cycling, and targeted small segments of a cloned gene. Mullis considered these experiments a success, but could not convince other researchers.
* In '''June 1984''' Cetus held its annual meeting in [[Monterey, California]]. Its scientists and consultants presented their results, and considered future projects. Mullis presented a poster on the production of oligonucleotides by his laboratory, and presented some of the results from his experiments with PCR.&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; Only [[Joshua Lederberg]], a Cetus consultant, showed any interest.&lt;ref name=Mullis-1/&gt; Later at the meeting, Mullis was involved in a physical altercation with another Cetus researcher over a dispute unrelated to PCR.&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; The other scientist left the company, and Mullis was removed as head of the oligo synthesis lab.

==Development==
* In '''September 1984''' Tom White, [[Vice president|VP]] of Research at Cetus (and a close friend), pressured Mullis to take his idea to the group developing the genetic mutation assay.  Together, they spent the following months designing experiments that could convincingly show that PCR is working on genomic DNA.  Unfortunately, the expected amplification product was not visible in [[agarose gel electrophoresis]],&lt;ref name=Scharf&gt;Scharf et al. "Direct Cloning and Sequence Analysis of Enzymatically Amplified Genomic Sequences" Science vol. 233, pp. 1076–78 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; leading to confusion as to whether the reaction had any specificity to the targeted region.
* In '''November 1984'''&lt;ref name=Rabinow/&gt; the amplification products were analyzed by [[Southern blot]]ting, which clearly demonstrating increasing amount of the expected 110 [[base pair|bp]] DNA product.&lt;ref name=Saiki1&gt;Saiki RK et al. "Enzymatic Amplification of β-globin Genomic Sequences and Restriction Site Analysis for Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia" Science vol. 230 pp. 1350–54 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;  Having the first visible signal, the researchers began optimizing the process.  Later, the amplified products were cloned and sequenced, showing that only a small fraction of the amplified DNA is the desired target, and that the [[Klenow fragment]] then being used only rarely incorporates incorrect nucleotides during replication.&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt;

==Exposition==
* As per normal industrial practice, the results were first used to apply for [[patent]]s.  Mullis applied &lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB "Process for amplifying nucleic acid sequences." U.S. Patent 4,683,202.&lt;/ref&gt; for a patent covering the basic idea of PCR and many potential applications, and was asked by the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|PTO]] to include more results.  On '''March 28, 1985''' the entire development group (including Mullis) filed an application&lt;ref&gt;Mullis, KB et al. "Process for amplifying, detecting, and/or-cloning nucleic acid sequences." U.S. Patent 4,683,195.&lt;/ref&gt; that is more focused on the analysis of the Sickle Cell Anemia mutation via PCR and [[Oligomer restriction]].  After modification, both patents were approved on '''July 28, 1987'''.
* In the '''spring of 1985''' the development group began to apply the PCR technique to other targets.  Primers and probes were designed for a variable segment of the [[Human leukocyte antigen]] [[HLA-DQA1|DQα]] gene.  This reaction was much more specific than that for the β-hemoglobin target – the expected PCR product&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt; is directly visible on [[agarose gel electrophoresis]].  The amplification products from various sources were also cloned and sequenced, the first determination of new  alleles by PCR.&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt;  At this same time the original Oligomer Restriction assay technique was replaced with the more general [[Allele specific oligonucleotide]] method.&lt;ref name=Saiki2&gt;Saiki et al. "Analysis of enzymatically amplified β-globin and HLA DQα DNA with allele-specific oligonucleotide probes." Nature vol. 324 (6093) pp. 163–6 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also '''early in 1985''', the group began using a thermostable DNA polymerase (the [[Klenow fragment|enzyme]] used in the original reaction is destroyed at each heating step).  At the time&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt; only two had been described, from [[Thermus aquaticus|Taq]] and [[Bacillus stearothermophilus|Bst]].  The report on Taq polymerase&lt;ref name=Chien/&gt; was more detailed, so it was chosen for testing.  The Bst polymerase was later found to be unsuitable for PCR{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}.  That summer Mullis attempted to isolate the enzyme, and a group outside of Cetus was contracted to make it, all without success.  In the '''Fall of 1985''' Susanne Stoffel and David Gelfand at Cetus succeed in making the polymerase, and it was immediately found by Randy Saiki to support the PCR process.
* With patents submitted, work proceeded to report PCR to the general scientific community.  An abstract for an [[American Society of Human Genetics]] meeting in [[Salt Lake City]] was submitted in '''April 1985''', and the first announcement of PCR was made there by Saiki in '''October'''.&lt;ref&gt;Saiki, R et al. "A Novel Method for the Prenatal Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Anemia" Amer. Soc. Human Genetics, Oct. 9–13, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two publications were planned – an 'idea' paper from Mullis, and an 'application' paper from the entire development group.  Mullis submitted his manuscript to the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], which rejected it for not including results.  The other paper, mainly describing the [[Oligomer restriction|OR]] analysis assay, was submitted to [[Science (journal)|Science]] on '''September 20, 1985''' and was accepted in November.  After the rejection of Mullis' report in December, details on the PCR process were hastily added to the second paper, which appears on '''December 20, 1985'''.&lt;ref name=Saiki1/&gt;
* In '''May 1986''' Mullis presented PCR at the Cold Spring Harbor Symposium,&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB et al. "Specific enzymatic amplification of DNA in vitro: the polymerase chain reaction." Cold Spring Harbor Symp. Quant. Biol. vol. 51 pp. 263–73 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; and published a modified version of his original 'idea' manuscript much later.&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB and Faloona FA "Specific Synthesis of DNA in vitro via a Polymerase-Catalyzed Chain Reaction." Methods in Enzymology vol. 155(F) pp. 335–50 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  The first non-Cetus report using PCR was submitted on '''September 5, 1986''',&lt;ref&gt;Verlaan-de Vries M et al. "A dot-blot screening procedure for mutated ras oncogenes using synthetic oligodeoxynucleotides." Gene vol. 50(1–3) pp. 313–20 (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; indicating how quickly other laboratories began implementing the technique.  The Cetus development group published their detailed sequence analysis of PCR products on '''September 8, 1986''',&lt;ref name=Scharf/&gt; and their use of [[Allele specific oligonucleotide|ASO]] probes on '''November 13, 1986'''.&lt;ref name=Saiki2/&gt;
* The use of Taq polymerase in PCR was announced by Henry Erlich at a [[International Congress of Human Genetics|meeting]] in Berlin on '''September 20, 1986''', submitted for publication in '''October 1987''', and was published early the next year'.&lt;ref name=Saiki3&gt;Saiki et al. "Primer-directed enzymatic amplification of DNA with a thermostable DNA polymerase." Science vol. 239 pp. 487–91 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  The patent for PCR with Taq polymerase was filed on '''June 17, 1987''', and is issued on '''October 23, 1990'''.&lt;ref&gt;Mullis, KB et al. "Process for amplifying, detecting, and/or cloning nucleic acid sequences using a thermostable enzyme." U.S. Patent 4,965,188.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variation==

* In '''December 1985''' a joint venture between Cetus and [[PerkinElmer|Perkin-Elmer]] was established to develop instruments and reagents for PCR.  Complex [[Thermal cycler|Thermal Cyclers]] were constructed to perform the Klenow-based amplifications, but never marketed.  Simpler machines for Taq-based PCR were developed, and on '''November 19, 1987''' a press release announces the commercial availability of the "PCR-1000 Thermal Cycler" and "AmpliTaq DNA Polymerase".
* In the '''Spring of 1985''' John Sninsky at Cetus began to use PCR for the difficult task of measuring the amount of HIV circulating in blood.  A viable test was announced on '''April 11, 1986''', and published in '''May 1987'''.&lt;ref&gt;Kwok S et al. "Identification of HIV sequences by using in vitro enzymatic amplification and oligomer cleavage detection." J. Virol. vol. 61(5) pp. 1690–4 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;  Donated blood could then be screened for the virus, and the effect of antiviral drugs directly monitored.
* In '''1985''' Norm Arnheim, also a member of the development team, concluded his sabbatical at Cetus and assumed an academic position at [[University of Southern California|USC]].  He began to investigate the use of PCR to amplifiy samples containing just a single copy of the target sequence.  By '''1989''' his lab developed multiplex-PCR on single sperm to directly analyze the products of meiotic recombination.&lt;ref&gt;Boehnke M et al. "Fine-structure genetic mapping of human chromosomes using the polymerase chain reaction on single sperm." Am J Hum Genet vol. 45(1) pp. 21–32 (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;  These single-copy amplifications, which had first been run during the characterization of Taq polymerase,&lt;ref name=Saiki3/&gt; became vital to the study of [[ancient DNA]], as well as the genetic typing of preimplanted embryos.
* In '''1986''' Edward Blake, a forensics scientist working in the Cetus building, collaborated with Henry Erlich a researcher at Cetus, to apply PCR to the analysis of criminal evidence.  A panel of DNA samples from old cases was collected and coded, and was analyzed blind by Saiki using the HLA DQα assay.  When the code was broken, all of the evidence and perpetrators matched.  Blake and Erlich's group used the technique almost immediately in "Pennsylvania v. Pestinikas",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forensicdna.com/Timeline020702.pdf Forensic Science Timeline (PDF).]&lt;/ref&gt; the first use of PCR in a criminal case.  This DQα test is developed by Cetus as one of their "Ampli-Type" kits, and became part of early protocols for the testing of forensic evidence, such as in the [[O. J. Simpson murder case]].
* By '''1989''' [[Alec Jeffreys]], who had earlier developed and applied the first [[DNA Fingerprinting]] tests, used PCR to increase their sensitivity.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffreys A et al. "Amplification of human minisatellites." Nucleic Acids Research vol. 23 pp. 10953-71 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  With further modification, the amplification of highly polymorphic [[Variable number tandem repeat|VNTR]] loci became the standard protocol for [[National DNA Database]]s such as [[Combined DNA Index System|CODIS]].
* In '''1987''' Russ Higuchi succeeded in amplifying DNA from a human hair.&lt;ref&gt;Higuchi R et al. "DNA typing from single hairs." Nature vol. 332(6164) pp. 543–6 (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;  This work expanded to develop methods for the amplification of DNA from highly degraded samples, such as from [[Ancient DNA]] and in [[Forensics|forensic]] evidence.

==Coda==
* On '''December 22, 1989''' the journal [[Science (journal)|Science]] awarded Taq Polymerase (and PCR) its first "Molecule of the Year".  The 'Taq PCR' paper&lt;ref name=Saiki3/&gt; became for several years the most [[Citation index|cited]] publication in biology.
* After the publication of the first PCR paper,&lt;ref name=Saiki1/&gt; the [[United States Government]] sent a stern letter to Randy Saiki, admonishing him for publishing a report on [[Nuclear chain reaction|"chain reactions"]] without the required prior review and approval by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].  Cetus responded, explaining the differences between PCR and the [[Nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* On '''July 23, 1991''' Cetus announced that its sale to the neighboring biotechnology company [[Chiron Corporation|Chiron]].  As part of the sale, rights to the PCR patents were sold for USD $300 million to [[Hoffman-La Roche]] (who in '''1989''' had bought limited rights to PCR).  Many of the Cetus PCR researchers moved to the Roche subsidiary, [[Roche Diagnostics|Roche Molecular Systems]].
* On '''October 13, 1993''' Kary Mullis, who had left Cetus in '''1986''', was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]].  On the morning of his acceptance speech,&lt;ref name=MullisLecture/&gt; he was nearly arrested by Swedish authorities for the "inappropriate use of a laser pointer".&lt;ref&gt;Mullis KB "Dancing Naked in the Mind Field" Pantheon Books (1998) {{ISBN|0-679-44255-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Indian Institute of Remote Sensing''' is a premier institute for research, higher education and training in the field of Remote Sensing, Geoinformatics and GPS Technology for Natural Resources, Environmental and Disaster Management under the [[Department of Space|Indian Department of Space]], which was established in the year 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iirs.gov.in/about-iirs|title=About IIRS - Welcome to Indian Institute of Remote Sensing (IIRS)|website=www.iirs.gov.in}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located in the city of [[Dehradun]], [[Uttarakhand]].

==History==
Formerly known as Indian Photo-interpretation Institute (IPI), the Institute was founded on 21 April 1966 under the aegis of Survey of India (SOI). It was established with the collaboration of the Government of The Netherlands on the pattern of Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC) of the University of Twente, formerly known as International Institute for Aerospace Survey and Earth Sciences, The Netherlands. The original idea of setting the Institute came from India's first Prime Minister Pandit Jawahar Lal Nehru during his visit to The Netherlands in 1957.

The Institute's building at Kalidas Road, Dehradun was inaugurated on 27 May 1972. Since its founding, the Institute has been playing a key role in capacity building in remote sensing and geoinformatics technology and their applications for the benefit of the user community from India and abroad. Today, it has programmes for all levels of users, i.e. mid-career professionals, researchers, academia, fresh graduates and policy makers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iirs.gov.in/historyandobjectives ]{{cite web|url=https://www.iirs.gov.in/historyandobjectives#|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NRSA converted into a government entity under DOS/ISRO===
NRSA is closely associated with various programmes of the Department of Space (DOS)/Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), in particular, the Earth Observation Programme, Disaster Management Support and other programmes of national importance. To enable NRSA to carry out its responsibilities in a more effective manner, the Government has after careful consideration, decided to convert it into a Government entity, to be called a National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), a Centre under DOS/ISRO, effective 1 September 2008.

===Reorganisation of the IIRS as independent unit of ISRO===
Indian Institute of Remote Sensing, Dehradun has been premier institute responsible for capacity building in the field of Remote Sensing and GIS applications. It has grown manifolds and establish itself as an institute of repute both nationally and internationally. Realising the potential of Earth Observation System and ISRO’s forthcoming initiatives in the areas of Natural Resource Survey, Earth and Atmospheric Sciences and Oceanography, Dr. K. Radhakrishnan, Chairman ISRO has reorganised IIRS as a separate entity of ISRO w.e.f. 30 April 2011. IIRS will continue its Training, Education and Research programmes with enhanced focus on Microwave Remote Sensing, Hyperspectral Remote Sensing and Climate studies.

The institute will be guided by a Management Council which will provide overall direction for the development of the institute. Dr. P.S. Roy, Outstanding Scientist has been appointed as first Director of IIRS w.e.f 30 April 2011.

==Courses==
The focus of the IIRS is training and education in the field of [[geoinformatics]].

The '''Institute of Mathematical Sciences''' (Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas – ICMAT) is a mixed institute belonging to the Spanish National Research Council (Consejo Superior de Investigaciones, [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) together with three [[Madrid]] universities: the Autonomous University of Madrid ([[Universidad Autónoma de Madrid]], UAM), the Carlos III University of Madrid ([[Universidad Carlos III de Madrid]], UC3M) and the Complutense University of Madrid ([[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]], UCM). The ICMAT headquarters is located in a new building on the UAM [[Cantoblanco]] campus ([[Madrid]], [[Spain]]).

The ICMAT is composed of the mathematicians belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] and researchers from the three Madrid universities. The structure and composition of the center was based on an initial selection carried out with the assistance of the National Agency for Public Education ([[Agencia Nacional de Evaluación y Prospectiva]] – ANEP) after a public call issued to all interested parties.
 
[[File:ICMAT building.JPG|thumbnail|The ICMAT building is located in Madrid, Spain]]

==Research at the ICMAT==
The ICMAT is an institute where work on a broad range of mathematics is conducted, including the transfer of knowledge and results. Initially the main fields of research are as follows: [[Mathematical Analysis]], [[Differential Geometry]], [[Algebraic Geometry]], [[Partial Differential Equations]], [[Fluid Mechanics]], [[Dynamical Systems]], [[Geometric Mechanics]] and [[Mathematical Physics]]. In addition to the inclusion of research lines in [[Number Theory]], [[Group Theory]] and [[Combinatorics]] in 2011.

Among the research results obtained by researchers from the Institute that have so far had the greatest impact, it is worth mentioning the [solution to the Nash problem in Singularity Theory http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/176-3/p11] by Javier Fernández de Bobadilla and María Pe; the [solution to the Sidon problem in Number Theory by Javier Cilleruelo and Carlos Vinuesa https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5024.pdf]; the [solution to the Arnold conjecture in Hydrodynamics http://annals.math.princeton.edu/2012/175-1/p09] by Daniel Peralta Salas and Alberto Enciso; the [construction of the mathematical model for explaining how water waves break http://www.pnas.org/content/109/3/733.short] by the research team led by Diego Córdoba, and the recent results on [Lagrangian transport and their applications to the study of the ozone layer http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-12-0274.1] by the team led by Ana María Mancho.

== History of the ICMAT ==

=== Background to the ICMAT ===

The ICMAT emerged from the Department of Mathematics at the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] [[Institute of Mathematics and Fundamental Physics]], to which mathematicians belonging to the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] were assigned. The agreement for the creation of the center was signed in November, 2007, after assessment through the 2006–2009 Strategic Plan, to which all the centers connected with the CSIC are subject and in which the international commission recommended the establishment of a separate institute.

A look back over the long history of the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]] reveals what may be regarded as forerunners of the ICMAT: the Laboratorio Seminario Matemático of the [[Junta de Ampliación de Estudios]] (JAE) created in 1915, and the [[Instituto Jorge Juan de Matemáticas]], created in 1939 by the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]].

=== The ICMAT, Severo Ochoa Center of Excellence ===

In 2011 the ICMAT was chosen as one of the eight centers of excellence in the [[Severo Ochoa Program]] call for submissions issued by the then [[Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology]] (MICYT).

Among other distinctions, six ICMAT researchers have obtained [[European Research Council]] (ERC) [[Starting Grants]], which places the Institute in the foremost position in Europe in mathematics.

== Outreach at the ICMAT ==

Every year the ICMAT participates in the [[Science and Technology Week]], the [[Science in Action (competition)|Science in Action]] competition (the ICMAT being one of the organizing institutions) and since 2012 has participated in [[Researchers’ Night]] (in collaboration with the UAM).

Furthermore, the ICMAT has launched the Matemáticas en la Residencia program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmat.es/press%20outreach/outreach/MathResidence |title=Mathematics at the Residencia &amp;#124; Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas |publisher=Icmat.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in collaboration with the [[Residencia de Estudiantes]] and the [[Spanish National Research Council|CSIC]]) in which international figures for the public understanding of science such as [[Marcus du Sautoy]], [[Jesús María Sanz-Serna]], [[Pierre Cartier (mathematician)|Pierre Cartier]], [[Guillermo Martínez (writer)|Guillermo Martínez]], [[Edward Frenkel]], [[Christiane Rousseau]], [[Antonio Durán]] and [[John Allen Paulos]] have taken part, as well as the Graffiti and Maths competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmat.es/press%20outreach/outreach/GraffitiMaths |title=Grafiti y Matemáticas &amp;#124; Instituto de Ciencias Matemáticas |publisher=Icmat.es |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at secondary school students.

'''Medical intern''' is a term used in some countries to describe a [[physician]] in training who has completed [[medical school]] and has a [[medical degree]], but does not yet have a full license to practice [[medicine]] unsupervised.  In other countries medical education generally ends with a period of practical training similar to internship, but the way the overall program of academic and practical medical training is structured differs in each case, as does the terminology used (see [[medical education]] and [[medical school]] for further details).

==Australia==
In Australia, medical graduates must complete one year in an accredited hospital post prior to receiving full registration; this year of conditional registration is known as the intern year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ar/psa |title=National Internship Framework |publisher=[[Australian Medical Council]] |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate= 5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internship is completed not necessarily in a hospital at the same state as the graduate's medical school. This indeed depends on personal factors as well as professional career aspirations.

==Brazil==
In Brazil, medical school consists of six years or twelve semesters; the final two years (or one and a half year, depending on the University in question) are said to be the internship. During this time, students will undergo extensive hospital hours and do basic hospital work while supervised by both residents and staff. Usually, this period is divided among Internal Medicine, Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine and a final elective period in which the student may choose an area to in which to gain further experience. Upon conclusion of internship, the student graduates to a doctor, and may then work unsupervised or enter a residency program in order to gain a specialty.

==Chile==
After High School, medical course in Chile consists in 7 years, having 5 years as a medical student and 2 years as an intern to obtain the degree of ''Médico Cirujano'' (the equivalent of General Practitioner in the USA). Internships should at least include the 4 basic specialties (Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics and Pediatrics) throughout this period. After completing the internship, the new physician may work in primary care, hospitals or apply to residencies for a specialty.

==DR Congo==
DR Congo has a 2 years internship program for public health schools. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Many hospitals employ Doctors prior to their full registration with the medical council (CNOM).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Ecuador==
After finishing high school, students have the possibility to apply to medical school. Medical school generally consist of 8 years of medical school and one year of internship, through which the student rotate through different surgical and clinical specialties. After this, the student gets the title of Medical Doctor (according to US degrees).
Additionally, there is one compulsory year of community medicine in order to obtain the medical register and licence from the Public Health Ministry (MSP). After this, the MD has the possibility to do residency or apply to a specialty.

==Egypt==
One year of Internship or Clerkship Training in a University or Teaching Hospital is done after graduating from medicine school. During this year, the graduate must complete two month rotations in each General Surgery, Internal Medicine, Paediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynaecology. They also must complete one month rotations of their choice in each a sub-specialty of Surgery, sub-specialty of Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology and ER medicine. Once the graduate has completed their Internship they are awarded licence to practise.

==Germany==
The regulation in Germany from 1988 to 2004 provided for medical doctors who wanted legal qualification or license to serve as “Arzt im Praktikum” (physician in internship) for 18 months. In 2004 this regulation was abolished. Since then doctors of medicine, who have successfully finished their medical studies, have received legal qualification immediately and the status of assistant doctor when taking up a medical occupation. However, they cannot enter private practice or work unsupervised until receiving their „Facharzt“ (full board certification) in their chosen specialty.

==Ghana==
The housemanship (internship period) is a two - year period after graduating from medical school during which newly qualified doctors, practice under supervision in designated hospitals in the country. This involves six (6) month rotations each in Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Paediatrics in no particular order. Alternatively, a houseman may opt for a rotation in Anaesthesia or Psychiatry in place of one of the traditional four rotation areas.  During this period the houseman (intern) is given provisional registration status with the Ghana Medical and Dental Council and would only be granted full registration status after successfully completing the housemanship. They then assume the rank of Medical Officer (M.O.).

==India==
{{Main|Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship}}
After four and half years of medical school (degree of MBBS) every doctor in India has to go through a one-year [[Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship|compulsory rotatory internship]] in various specialities to get permanent registration in [[Medical Council of India]] as a physician. Only after getting permanently registered with MCI, one is licensed to practice medicine as a primary care doctor throughout the India. &lt;br&gt;
Dental sciences students too undergo compulsory internships for one year without which degree requirements are not considered full and professional license to practise is not entrusted to an individual.

==Iran==
In Iran, [[internship]] is an 18-month period at the end of the 7 year medical education which should be done in the university hospitals. Then, medical students can graduate and work independently as a Medical Doctor (MD) or participate in National Comprehensive Residency Exam and continue to study in desired specialty. If they decide to work as a General Practitioner, they should first do their compulsory service for a period, regarding their national service or their individual status, in underserved areas recognized by Iranian Ministry of Health, as part of the commitments to the ministry. Medical [[Internship]] offers a schedule that rotates through all the major and minor specialties, including [[emergency medicine]], [[internal medicine]], [[obstetrics &amp; gynecology]], [[pediatrics]], [[surgery]], [[dermatology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[otorhinolaryngology]], [[infectious diseases]], and [[psychiatry]].

==Iraq==
In Iraq, after graduation from a 6 years medical program, graduates start their internship in hospitals. The medical intern must finish a period of 3 months in each of the specialities of [[internal medicine]], [[obstetrics and gynaecology]], [[surgery]], [[psychiatry]] and [[pediatrics]]. Also, they work for variable periods of time in some of the subspecialties as assigned]. Each speciality is given in particular courses of 3 months, after completion of internship doctors are eligible to practice independently. 
According to the above definition of internship, interns have a degree but they are not fully licensed to practice medicine unsupervised.

==Ireland==
In order to register fully with the [[Irish Medical Council]], graduates are required to complete twelve months of training in an approved public hospital.  Internship comprises at least one surgical rotation and at least one medical rotation. A minimum of two months and a maximum of three months may be spent in another speciality, including [[emergency medicine]], [[general practice]], [[obstetrics &amp; gynaecology]], [[paediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[anaesthesia]] and [[radiology]].

After completion of the internship, doctors obtain a certificate of satisfactory service. Upon receipt of the certificate, the Medical Council will entitle the provisionally registered doctor to apply for full registration in the General Register of Medical Practitioners, subject to payment of a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/Registration/Internship-Registration/ |title=Internship registration |publisher=[[Medical Council (Ireland)]] |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
In Israel, medical graduates must complete one year in an accredited hospital prior to receiving full registration; this year of conditional registration is known as the intern year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.health.gov.il/English/Services/MedicalAndHealthProfessions/GeneralMedicine/Pages/stage.aspx |title=Internship in Medicine in Israel |publisher=State of Israel Ministry of Health |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing this mandatory year, the graduate can go into a specialty program, or practice general medicine.
There are two kinds of internships:
* "Direct internship" is done in either [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]] or [[surgery]].  Interns spend 6 consecutive months (the second half of the year) in their chosen specialty, and 2 months surgery, 2 months in pediatrics, and 1 month in emergency medicine.
* "Rotating internship" offers a schedule that rotates through all the major specialties, including 3 months of [[internal medicine]], 2 months of [[pediatrics]], 2 months of [[surgery]], 1 month of [[emergency medicine]], 1 month of [[anesthesiology|anesthesiology and intensive care]], and 2 elective months.

Regardless of the chosen program, every intern gets a month off.

Some applicants prefer the rotating program because it generally is not as strenuous as a straight internship.  However, a straight year can provide better preparation for the second year of residency.

==Jordan==
In Jordan, after finishing medical school (6 years), medical students receive the M.D. degree but may only practice medicine after working in a hospital for 12 months. After completion of this year of hospital work, the student will be licensed to work as a GP.

==Lebanon==
In Lebanon, universities like the American University of Beirut (AUB), the University of Balamand (UOB), or the Lebanese American University (LAU), follow the curriculum similar to that of universities in the US. But other universities, that follow the French (European) system like Universite Saint Joseph (USJ) follow the French curriculum, this excludes for example Pre-medical studies (BS in science), instead the student is directly enrolled in a 7-year program during which he studies science and medicine.

==Malaysia==
Every medical graduate, from a Malaysian public or private university, or from an overseas-approved university/college, will have to apply for temporary registration with the [[Malaysian Medical Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmc.gov.my/v1/|title=Malaysian Medical Council|work=www.mmc.gov.my|accessdate=6 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706133421/http://www.mmc.gov.my/v1/|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the council has approved their application, they are listed as 'Approved for Consideration'. This Approval is required for them to apply for the position of Medical Graduate Officer (Pegawai Perubatan Siswazah) from the government, to be accepted into the government service.

Once the application has been accepted by the government ( through the process of an interview, and government servant compulsory course), the Council will register them as a Medical Graduate Officer with a Temporary Registration Number, which allows them to serve as house officers (called H.O. for short), working in major government hospitals only (ones with adequate consultants of each specialties/departments).

Upon the completion of rotations in:
*Internal medicine
*Surgery
*Paediatrics
*Orthopaedics,
*Obstetrics and Gynecology
*A choice of Emergency Medicine, Anaesthesiology, Psychiatry, Family Medicine;

for 4 months in each rotation (making a total of 24 months of housemanship), they will then be registered by the Malaysian Medical Council as “Fully Registered”.

The government service is compulsory for every medical graduate in order to obtain full registration with the Malaysian Medical Council, in order for them to practice independently.

There are cases where the period of 24 months of housemanship is extended due to incompetency and health reasons, which is under the jurisdiction of the Council. A fully registered doctor (called medical officer, MO) are then free to choose to work in the government sector or the private sector.

Consultants in this country, largely, refers to a doctor with completed specialty and subspecialty training and a Master or PhD degree, approved by the Council.

==Mexico==
In order to become a physician in Mexico, one must study 12 years of elementary and high school before entering [[medical school]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facmed.unam.mx/marco/index.php?dir_ver=16 Curriculum of Medical School at UNAM, México] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002030446/http://www.facmed.unam.mx/marco/index.php?dir_ver=16 |date=2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical education includes:
 
* 5 years of medical school (10 semesters) that include basic sciences and clinical rotations.
* one year of [[rotating internship|rotating]] [[medical internship|internship]], in which the main objective is to become gradually responsible to manage clinical attention without supervision. Clinical areas included are: pediatrics, surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency department, communitary medicine. 
* one year of [[social service]], whether the medical school one attends is private or public.

After completing medical school, the medical student is able to obtain a license to work as a general physician. If it is of interest of this general physician to train in a specific field such as pediatrics, internal medicine, orthopedic surgery, etc., he/she must complete a residency program of 3 to 7 years (it depends of the chosen field) to obtain a license to work as a specialist in such field.

==Nepal==
{{Main|Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship}}
After four and half years of medical school (degree of MBBS) every doctor in Nepal has to go through a one-year [[Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship|compulsory rotatory internship]] in various specialities to get permanent registration in [[Nepal Medical Council]] as a physician.Internship should be completed from their own Medical college as recommended by NMC.Only after getting permanently registered with NMC, one is licensed to practice medicine as a primary care doctor throughout the Nepal.

==The Netherlands==
Netherlands historically had a 4-year preclinical phase completed by a master-equivalent pre-doctoral degree ([[doctorandus]]) followed by a two-year internship phase, with similar responsibilities to that of a US intern. The two-year training would lead to an M.D. degree with license for independent practice upon successful completion. With the introduction of the Bachelor/Master system as prescribed by the [[Bologna Process]], the medical education curriculum has been modified in all of the 8 medical schools in the country to consist of a three-year bachelor and a three-year master program. The bachelor phase is usually almost exclusively preclinical while the master will include internships, skills trainings and refresher courses, as well as a research internship. The "master" is awarded with an M.D. degree.

==Nigeria==
The internship program (Housemanship) is one-year period in most of the Hospitals in Nigeria. After internship program which is done under the supervision of qualified licensed doctors; each house officer is now required to do a compulsory one - year program in NYSC (National Youth Service Corp) where posted. During this period a provisional license must have been issued to house-officer by Nigeria Medical &amp; Dental Council in order for them to practice, temporarily with little or no supervision. Residency program is available for any medical doctor who wishes to continue in their medical career. This involves writing a postgraduate examination termed "primaries" in any faculty of choice.

==Peru==
In Peru, the medical intern is the seventh year medical student who must to complete the specialities of [[internal medicine]], [[obstetrics and gynaecology]], [[surgery]] and [[pediatrics]]. In some universities, mental health is also included in the 7th year curriculum. In some hospitals this period is paid.
[[Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia]] has internship and externship. Where the latter acts as an apprentice of the former, thus the medical student has two years of medical practice.

==Slovenia==
In Slovenia, medical graduates (after 6-year med school) must complete a six-month paid internship at a chosen medical institution. During the internship they must rotate through departments of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, OB/GYN, ENT, ophthalmology, emergency medicine and anesthesiology, with emphasys being given to emergencies in each department. Completing the internship is a condition for taking the professional medical exam, passing which gives doctor a license to practice medicine in Slovenia and apply for a specialization.

==South Africa==

An '''Internship''' is a compulsory (statutory) requirement that recently qualified doctors who are registered with the HPCSA work in designated hospitals under medical supervision for two years. They may work independently within this context in specified medical disciplines and for periods of time designated by the HPCSA. They are employed by the institution and this option is generally only available to South Africans.  Foreign qualified doctors that have recently qualified and do not have the required medical experience to register with the HPCSA may be requested by the HPCSA to do their internship in order to qualify for full registration. They either do this back in their country or in South Africa.

In South Africa, an '''elective''' for medical students is where a student arranges to visit a hospital for a short period (3 – 6 months) of time to gain experience in a different medical context,  where they will work under supervision and be mentored by experienced doctors.  It is primarily a learning experience, they cannot work independently and are required to register with HPCSA if they are foreign student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpcsa.co.za/PBOccupational/Registration |title=Professional Boards: registration |publisher=Health Professions Council of South Africa |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
The [[Healthcare in Sweden|Swedish]] equivalent to an internship is the ''allmäntjänstgöring'' ("general practice"), which is a requirement for obtaining a medical license. Its duration is stated as at least 18 months, but usually lasts a bit longer, 21 months in most cases. The students have to fulfill at least 9 months practice in medicine and surgery (at least 3 months of each, but mostly 6+6 months), 3 months psychiatry and 6 months as a GP.  After the ''allmäntjänstgöring'', the students have to complete a test from the National Board of Health and Welfare ("Socialstyrelsen"), to receive their medical license. Then follows specialisation practice ("specialisttjänstgöring"), the equivalent of residency.

==United Kingdom==
The [[United Kingdom|British]] equivalent of an intern is the Foundation Year 1 (F1, FY1) doctor, who is on the first year of their two-year [[Foundation Programme]], and has provisional registration with the [[General Medical Council]]. Before the introduction of the Foundation Programme in 2005, the equivalent post was called a "[[Foundation house officer|House officer]]" (also known as 'Junior House Officer' and latterly Pre-Registration House Officer or PRHO). Despite its technical obsolescence, the term "House Officer" is still used by many clinicians. (The term "[[Senior House Officer]]" or SHO is still used to refer to a tier of doctors which may include both those who are in the second year of Foundation Programme, and those who have begun a specialty training programme). The [[Foundation Programme]] is a 2 year long training period in which competencies are developed and documented.

==United States==
A medical [[internship]] typically lasts one year (a loose term) and usually begins on July 1. Internships come in two variations: transitional and specialty track. After a physician has completed an internship and Step&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[USMLE]] or Level&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[COMLEX-USA]], they can practice as a [[general practitioner]]. However, the majority of physicians complete a specialty track [[medical residency]] over two to seven years, depending on the specialty. The [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] ([[ACGME]]) officially dropped the term "intern" in 1975, instead referring to individuals in their first year of graduate [[medical education]] as "[[Residency (medicine)|residents]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/Portals/0/PFAssets/ProgramRequirements/ab_ACGMEglossary.pdf |title=Glossary of terms July 1, 2013 |publisher=[[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuela==
In Venezuela there are two different types of medical internship. One is a two-year postgraduate internship and the other is a one-year compulsory pre graduation internship.
* Postgraduate internship: Is an elective two year postgraduate internship done in type III or IV hospitals. It is required for obtaining a medical license (the other option is a one-year rural setting work). The intern must complete for four month each of the specialities of internal medicine, obstetrics, a surgery block (general surgery and orthopedics surgery) and pediatrics. Also there is an six months externship in a city setting outpatient clinic.
* Pre graduation internship: In Venezuela there are 2 different types medical studies conducting to a medical degree. The program conducting to the degree of  "Médico cirujano"&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Médico#Denominaciones]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} during the final year or one and a half year, depending on the university program, has a compulsory internship program under the supervision of qualified licensed doctors at a type III or IV hospital. During this time, students will undergo basic hospital work. The intern must complete for eight weeks each of the specialities of internal medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, general surgery, orthopedics surgery and pediatrics. Also there is an eight-week externship done in a rural outpatient clinic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24348">'''Jewish Painters of Montreal''' refers to a group of artists who depicted the [[social realism]] of Montreal during the 1930s and 1940s. First used by the media to describe participants of the annual YMHA-YWHA art exhibition, the term was popularized in the 1980s by art historian and curator Esther Trepannier.&lt;ref name=Trep2&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Since then these artists have been exhibited collectively in public galleries across Canada. In 2009 the [[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] mounted a touring exhibition ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: a Witness to their time 1930-1948''&lt;ref name=McCord&gt;McCord Museum of Canadian History.

[http://outlookmagazine.ca/images/outlook/issues/23/Jewish%20painters.pdf "Jewish Painters of Montreal: a Witness to their time" ''The Outlook''. Vancouver Jul-Aug 2010. Web.]&lt;/ref&gt;

This collective included two generations of painters — established artists: Jack Beder (1910-1987), Alexandre Bercovitch (1891-1951), [[Eric Goldberg (artist)|Eric Goldberg]] (1890-1959), [[Louis Muhlstock]] (1904-2001); those in mid-career: [[Sam Borenstein]] (1908-1969), [[Herman Heimlich]] (1904-1986), [[Harry Mayerovitch]] (1910-2004), Bernard Mayman (1885-1966), Ernst Neumann (1907-1956), Fanny Wiselberg (1906-1986); and those just beginning: [[Sylvia Ary]] (1923-2011), [[Rita Briansky]] (1925), [[Ghitta Caiserman-Roth]] (1923-2005), [[Alfred Pinsky]] (1921-1999), and Moses "Moe" Reinblatt (1917-1979).&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p28.&lt;/ref&gt; As a group during the 30s and 40s, they were united in their choice of subjects — the human figure, Montreal and its people, and the war.&lt;ref name=McCord/&gt; As individual artists, their style varied from [[socialist realism]] to stylized [[expressionism]] with some the subject of recent museum exhibitions in Montreal, Ottawa or New York.

== History ==
These artists were either new arrivals from Eastern Europe or children of immigrants from that region. All were trained artists with a deep appreciation of impressionism and post-impressionism.&lt;ref name=ELAN&gt;Callaghan, Lori. ''Visual Arts from Painting to Performance Collectives'', [http://www.quebec-elan.org/histories/oneView/10 "The seeds of a community"] English Language Arts Network (ELAN). Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Most lived east of [[Mount Royal]] in Montreal's Jewish neighbourhood where, by 1926, Bercovitch, Mulstock and Reinblatt met informally at Bernard Mayman’s sign store on St Lawrence Boulevard.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p219"&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p219.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the opening of the new YMHA (Young Men's Hebrew Association) on Mount Royal Avenue in 1929, the group became associated with its annual art exhibition. As the Depression of the 1930s deepened, many of these artists found themselves in reduced circumstances. Louis Mulstock used discarded sugar sacks as canvas, while in 1936 Bercovitch took a teaching position at the YWHA (Young Women's Hebrew Association). There he instructed a new generation of artists including daughter Sylvia Ary, Ghitta Caisserman and Rita Briansky,&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p221&lt;/ref&gt; all of whom included in the annual YMHA-YWHA art exhibition. Although there were discussions on creating a formal organization of Jewish Artists, as Bercovitch, Goldberg, Muhlstock, Mayervitch and Reinblatt were members of the 1938 [[Eastern Group of Painters]] and/or the 1939 Contemporary Arts Society, they were prohibited from other affiliations.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p275.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of these artists had socialistic leanings which was reflected in their art. Bercovitch had married Russian revolutionary Bryna Avrutick  1915&lt;ref name=Inter/&gt; and was hired to teach art in Turkestan by [[Wassily Kandinsky]], then the Soviet Commisaire for Art and Theatre, in 1922.&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p219"/&gt; Muhlstock identified with the working class and referred to his imagery as "proletarian art",&lt;ref name=Penn&gt;Anreus, Alejandro, Linden, Diana L. and Weinberg, Jonathan. ''The Social and the Real: Political Art of the 1930s in the Western Hemisphere'' Penn State Press (Philadelphia). 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-271-02691-6}} [http://www.psupress.org/books/SampleChapters/0-271-02691-Xsc.html Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; He later described his choice of subject matter as "something I had known and experienced and seen, and so it was the thing I wanted to express".&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Charles. "Interview with Louis Muhlstock (Artist) 15/09/1973". National Gallery of Canada [http://www.gallery.ca/cybermuse/servlet/imageserver?src=DO914-1000&amp;ext=x.pdf Web.]&lt;/ref&gt; Harry Mayerovitch wrote on social issues such as Montreal housing in the leftist ''[[Canadian Forum]]'' (Toronto): "Nothing has been done to alleviate the overcrowding of low wage earners; nothing to render slum property a less profitable investment; nothing to provide new housing for that shockingly large proportion of our population which lives in sub-standard dwellings ...".&lt;ref&gt;Mayerovitch, Harry. ''The Canadian Forum''. May 1940. National Gallery of Canada. [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey= "Is Housing to Be Forgotten?"] Web.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the younger generation, Caiserman (after 1964 Caiserman-Roth) was the daughter of Hananiah Meir Caiserman, a union organizer and Po’alei Zion (Labor Zionism) activist&lt;ref name=Caisserman&gt;Jewish Women;s Archive [http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/caiserman-roth-ghitta "Ghitta Caiserman-Roth".] Web&lt;/ref&gt; while Alfred Pinsky was the son of an American communist leader.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p263.&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 30s and early 40s, Caisserman, Pinsky and Briansky attended the [[Art Students League of New York]] where they studied under muralist [[Harry Sternberg]] of the [[Federal Art Project]]. In New York they were exposed to the work of Mexican artists [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]] and the social purpose of art was debated in both America and Canada. In 1941, Reinblatt viewed Orozco's 1932 mural in New York on his honeymoon while in 1948 both Caiserman and Pinsky, then married, traveled to Mexico to study mural art.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p264.&lt;/ref&gt;

These artists also responded to the degradation of human rights in Nazi-Germany and Quebec's restrictive 1937 [[Padlock Law]] against socialist and communists.&lt;ref name=cjournal&gt;Herland, Karen. [http://cjournal.concordia.ca/archives/20080403/reminiscing_about_jewish_montreal.php "Reminiscing about Jewish Montreal".] ''Concordia Journal.'' Concordia University. Web&lt;/ref&gt; During the 30s, Muhlstock who was a member of the Canadian League Against War and Fascism later commented: "Perhaps if the war wasn’t on I might not have gone in that direction, you see." As Canada's military commitment deepened, World War 2 became a topic for paintings, cartoons and political posters. Mayerovitch, appointed art director for the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1940, produced many soviet-style posters,&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p245.&lt;/ref&gt; while Reinblatt enlisted in the [[Royal Canadian Airforce]] in 1942 and was an official Canadian War Artist by 1944.&lt;ref&gt;ARTSask, [http://www.artsask.ca/en/artists/moereinblatt Moe Reinblatt]. Web&lt;/ref&gt; In 1945 Pinsky as union representative with the Royal Canadian Navy&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p207. {{ISBN|978-2761925310}}&lt;/ref&gt; also choose war as a subject matter, but like Mulstock and Reinblatt depicted the workers behind the war effort rather than combat.

== Recognition ==
'''1930-1949''' In the early 1930s Bercovitch, Muhlstock and Borenstein were recognized artists. In 1933 Bercovitch held his first solo exhibition at Sydney Carter Gallery&lt;ref&gt;National Gallery of Canada [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artist.php?iartistid=438 "Alexandre Bercovitch".] Web&lt;/ref&gt; which was reviewed favourably by Henri Girard.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Charles C.

Web&lt;/ref&gt; Mulhstock, considered one of the  finest draughtsmen in the country. was singled out for hi sensitive depictions of individuals by Montreal art critic Robert Ayre of ''The Gazette''. IBy the mid-30s 1935 they were reviewed collectively in the [[Canadian Forum]] (Toronto): "The subject matter of [Louis Muhlstock, Alexander Bercovitch, and Sam Borenstein] is similar: they paint the Montreal ghetto, tramp steamers in the harbour, street scenes, typical workers and members of the lumpen proletariat.... Muhlstock and Borenstein link their preoccupations closely with political awareness, though neither has as yet participated in the revolutionary movement."&lt;ref&gt;The National Art Gallery of Canada. [http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=14805 "A Cartoonist of the Left"]&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, many were mentioned in the reviews of the Art Society of Montreal, while the Annual YM-YWHA art exhibition drew favorable reviews in the English press.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p 184-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Respected as innovators in subject matter or form, by 1948 artists Beder, Bercovitch, Borenstein, Heimlich, Mayervitch, Muhlstock, Neumann, and Reinblatt had all exhibited at the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Art]] exhibitions.&lt;ref name=Trep2-275/&gt;

'''1950-1999''' In 1959 these artists were featured at the Montreal Museum of Fine Art's exhibition ''Works by Canadian Jewish Artists''.&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition catalogue. ''Exhibition of Works by Canadian Jewish Artists October 29 to November 15''. Montreal Museum of Fine Art, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in the art of the 30s and 40s was renewed in the mid-70s with the publication of Barry Lord's ''Canadian Art: Towards A Peoples History'' and with the [[National Gallery of Canada]]'s traveling exhibition ''Canadian Painting in the Thirties''. While both featured work by Bercovitch, Muhlstock and Goldberg, only Lord included the younger Jewish Painters of Montreal. However, in 1987 Montreal art historian and curator Esther Trepanier mounted an exhibition of their collective work at the Saidye Bronfman Centre (Montreal) which toured Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta and published ''Jewish Artists and Modernity''.&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p 12.&lt;/ref&gt; This renewed attention led to the acquisition of over 150 of their works by public institutions including the National Gallery of Canada, The Canadian War Museum, The National Archives and the Musée de Québec.&lt;ref&gt;John Donovan Biography [http://www.biferalifineart.com/artists/donovan/donovan.html Biferali Fine Art] Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contribution ==
As social realists, the Jewish Painters of Montreal combined streetscapes and figurative art with leftist ideals of social justice and worker solidarity.&lt;ref name=McCord/&gt; In 1936 Toronto critic Graham McInnis of ''[[Saturday Night (magazine)]]'' wrote: "Mr. Muhlstock... is one of the leaders of that small group of Montreal painters who have found that it is possible to paint one's immediate environment – to see forms and relationships from one's back window – and at the same time to paint well, and in a manner as fine and as native in this country as the most gnarled and twisted pine of the most jagged rock in the North Country."&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p184.&lt;/ref&gt; For art historian Esther Trepannier these artists of the 30s and 40s "unequivocally produced works that, both in their formal exploration and in their more contemporary, urban subjects, contributed towards the definition of the particular form of modernity that emerged between the major nationalist movements and abstraction"&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p205"&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p205.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Les Automatistes]] painters [[Paul-Émile Borduas]] and [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]]. For her these Jewish artists offered a decidedly more 'international' way of looking at the Canadian scene'."&lt;ref&gt;Trépanier, Esther. ''Jewish Painters of Montreal: Witnesses of their Time 1930-1948''. Montreal: Éditions de l’Homme, 2008. p204.&lt;/ref&gt; which, unlike their American and Mexican contemporaries, they adopted to distance themselves from the perceived nationalism of the [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]]. In terms of contribution, Trepannier has concluded that: "The artists of the Jewish community not only helped to define cultural modernity in Quebec and the rest of Canada during the interwar period, but have continued to enrich and enhance the originality of its development ever since."&lt;ref name="Trépanier, Esther 2008. p205"/&gt;

== Relevance and causes ==

=== Theory of mind ===
Mind-blindness is a state where the ToM has not been developed, or has been lost in an individual. According to the theory, ToM is implicit in neurotypical individuals. This enables one to make automatic interpretations of events taking into consideration the mental states of people, their desires and beliefs. [[Simon Baron-Cohen]] described how an individual lacking a ToM would perceive the world in a confusing and frightening manner, leading to a withdrawal from society.&lt;ref name=cohen1&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baron-Cohen |first=Simon |title=Autism: a specific cognitive disorder of 'mind-blindness |journal=[[International Review of Psychiatry]] |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |year=1990 |volume=2 |issue=1 |pages=81–90 |doi=10.3109/09540269009028274}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An alternative approach to the social impairment observed in mind-blindness focuses on emotion of subjects. Based on empirical evidence, [[Uta Frith]] concluded that the processing of complex cognitive emotions is impaired compared to simpler emotions. In addition, attachment does not seem to fail in the early childhood of autistics. This suggests that emotion is a component of social cognition that is separable from [[mentalization|mentalizing]].&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

Lombardo and Cohen updated the theory and pinpointed some additional factors that play an important part in ToM of autistic people. They highlighted that the middle [[cingulate cortex]] which is outside the traditional mentalizing region was underactive in autistic patients, while the rest of ToM activation was normal. This region was important in deciding how much to invest in a person and hence required mentalization.&lt;ref name=lamcohen&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lombardo |first=Michael V. |author2=Baron-Cohen, Simon |title=The role of the self in mindblindness in autism |journal=[[Consciousness and Cognition]] |publisher=[[Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness]] |date=1 March 2011 |volume=20 |issue=1 |pages=130–140 |doi=10.1016/j.concog.2010.09.006 |pmid=20932779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Biological basis ===
Neural correlates of the ToM point towards three regions of the brains. The anterior paracingulate cortex (Brodmann), is considered at the key region of mentalizing. It is located anterior corpus callosum and the anterior cingulate cortex. This cortex is associated with the medial frontal cortex where activation is associated with the mentalization of states. The cells of the ACC develops at the age of 4 months suggesting that the manifestations of mind-blindness may occur around this time.&lt;ref name=perry&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gallagher | first=Helen L. | author2=Frith, Christopher D. | title=Functional imaging of 'theory of mind' | journal=[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]] | publisher=[[Cell Press]] | location=[[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] | date=1 February 2003 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=77–83 | doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(02)00025-6 | pmid=12584026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the anterior paracingulate cortex is the superior temporal sulcus and the temporal poles that are involved with the ToM and its nature. However, these areas are not uniquely associated with mentalization. They aid in the activation of the regions that are associated with the ToM. The superior temporal sulcus is involved in the processing of behavioural information while the temporal poles are involved in the retrieval of personal experiences. These are considered important regions for the activation of the ToM regions and are associated with the mind-blindness. The temporal poles provide personal experiences for mentalization such as facial recognition, emotional memory and familiar voices. In patients suffering from semantic dementia, the temporal regions of these patients undergo atrophy and lead to certain deficits which can cause mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt;

[[File:250px-Gray726-STS.png|thumb|right|Superior temporal sulcus]]
The amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex also are a part of the ToM.  It is in involved in the interpretation of behaviour which plays an important role in social cognition and therefore contributes to the theory of the mind. It is suspected that the damage to the orbitofrontal cortex brings upon subtle impairments, but not a total loss of the ToM that would to mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=perry /&gt; Some studies{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} have shown that the orbitofrontal cortex is not directly associated with the theory of the mind or mind-blindness. However, a study by Stone and colleagues were able to show impaired ToM on mentalisation tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stone | first=V.E. | last2=Baron-Cohen | first2=S. | last3=Knight | first3=R.T. | title=Frontal lobe contributions to the theory of mind | journal=[[Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience]] | publisher=[[MIT Press]] | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | date=September 1998 | volume=10 | pages=640–656 | doi=10.1162/089892998562942 | pmid=9802997 | issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the frontal lobe is associated with executive function, researchers theorize that the frontal lobe plays an important role in ToM and its associated nature. It has also been suggested that the executive function and the theory of mind share the same regions.&lt;ref name=jose&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Josef Perner  | author2=Birgit Lang | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Development of theory of mind and executive control | journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences | publisher=Cell Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | date=1 September 1999 | volume=3 | issue=9 | doi=10.1016/s1364-6613(99)01362-5 | pages=337–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that ToM and mind-blindness can explain executive function deficits, it is argued that autism is not identified with the failure of the executive function.&lt;ref name=Peter&gt;{{cite book | last=Carruthers | first=Peter | authorlink=Peter Carruthers (philosopher) | editor1=Carruthers, Peter | editor2=[[Peter K.

Lesion studies show that when lesions are imposed to the medial frontal lobe, performance on mentalization tasks is reduced, similar to typical mind-blindness cases.&lt;ref name=tom&gt;{{cite journal | authors=Havet-Thomassin, P. Allain, F. Etcharry-Bouyx, &amp; D. le Gall | title=What about theory of mind after severe brain injury? | journal=[[Brain Injury (journal)|Brain Injury]] | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | date=2006 | volume=20 | issue=1 | pages=83–91 | doi=10.1080/02699050500340655 | pmid=16403703}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients that experienced frontal lobe injuries due to severe head trauma showed signs of mind blindness, as a result of a lost ToM. However, it is still debated whether the inactivation of the medial frontal lobe is involved in mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird|first=C. M.|title=The impact of extensive medial frontal lobe damage on 'Theory of Mind' and cognition|journal=[[Brain (journal)|Brain]]|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=14 January 2004|volume=127|issue=4|pages=914–928|doi=10.1093/brain/awh108|pmid=14998913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frith and Frith proposed that a neural network that comprised the medial prefrontal cortex, the anterior cingulate cortex and the STS, is crucial for the normal functioning of ToM and self monitoring. This so formed dorsal system is crucial for social cognition. Disruption of this neural network leads to mind-blindness in schizophrenic individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Frith | first=Uta | author2=Frith, C.D | title=The biological basis of social interaction | journal=[[Current Directions in Psychological Science]] | publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] | location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]] | date=October 2001 | volume=10 | pages=151–155 | issue=5 | doi=10.1111/1467-8721.00137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another clue towards a possible explanation of mind-blindness in autistics was done by Castelli and colleagues. They were able to show that the connectivity between occipital and the temporo-parietal regions were weaker in the autistic group than the control group. The under activation of this network may inhibit the interactive influences between regions that process higher and lower perceptual items.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

=== Relationship to diagnostic criteria ===

=== Relationship to autism ===
Mind-blindness is usually associated with [[Autism|autistic]] people. Lower performance on the mentalization tasks were the first screening task used to diagnose the autism, with a good prediction level.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt;

Cohen proposed the mind-blindness theory of autism as "deficits in the normal process of empathising". He described empathising to include the ToM, mind reading and taking an intentional stance. According to this view empathising includes the ability to attribute mental states and to react in an appropriate emotional manner which is appropriate to another's mental state.  More deficits tend to occur in reference to one's own mental states compared to the other's mental states. It has been proposed that autistic people undergo a specific developmental delay in the area of metarepresentational development. The delay facilitates mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=cohen2&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen |first=S. | title=The cognitive neuroscience of autism | journal=[[Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry]] | publisher=[[BMJ (company)|BMJ]] | location=London | date=1 July 2004 | volume=75 | issue=7 | pages=945–948 | doi=10.1136/jnnp.2003.018713| pmc=1739089 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some evidence that suggests that certain patients develop a rudimentary ToM and do not suffer from complete lack of ToM causing mind-blindness.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt; A study by Bowler concluded that mind-blindness and social impairment is not as straightforward as previously thought. It showed that a complete possession of ToM was not enough to protect from social impairments in autistic people. Conversely the absence or impairment of the ToM that leads to mind-blindness does not lead to social impairments.&lt;ref name=bowler&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bowler | first=Dermont. M. | title=Theory of Mind in Asperger's syndrome | journal=[[Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry]] | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=July 1992 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=877–893 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb01962.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social and cognitive differences seen in autistic people are often attributed due to mind blindness. Abnormal behaviour of autistic children are perceived to include a lack of reciprocity. Some cases in which mind-blindness manifests includes the child being totally withdrawn from social settings as well as not being able to make eye contact while in other cases the individual may attempt to interact with other people. However, global asocial behaviours is not the rule in autism. Cohen described the cognitive/mind-blindness effects in autistic people as a "triad of deficits". The triad consists of deficits in social, communication and imagination of others' mind.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt;

Ozonoff and colleagues were able to discriminate between autistic people diagnosed with [[Asperger's syndrome]] and other autistic people by their ability to solve ToM tasks. It is due to those diagnosed with AS seem more neurotypical in development early on in childhood. The siblings of individuals diagnosed with AS were shown to have a lesser variant of ToM deficits. This shows that the cognitive deficits that affect the ToM play central role in the phenotype expressed in AS diagnosed.&lt;ref name=ozonoff&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ozonoff | first=S | author2=Rogers, S. &amp; Pennington, B. | title=Asperger's syndrome: Evidence for an empirical distinction from high-functioning autism | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=November 1991 |volume=32 | issue=7 | pages=1107–1122 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1991.tb00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship to schizophrenia ===
People with [[schizophrenia]] also show deficits associated with mind-blindness.&lt;ref name="Pijnenborg2012"/&gt; However, there is an ongoing debate as to whether individuals with schizophrenia have an impaired ToM leading to mind-blindness or display an exaggerated ToM. Unlike autism, schizophrenia is a late onset condition. It is speculated that this difference in the condition may account for differences seen in the ToM abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Other Minds. How Humans Bridge the Divide Between Self And Others | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJqB_NboEYYC&amp;printsec=frontcover | origyear=[https://books.google.com/books?id=UxE1nwEACAAJ 2005] | year=2007 | publisher=[[Guilford Press]]| location=New York City | author=Langdon, Robyn |editors=Malle, Bertram F.; Hodges, Sara D. |chapter=Chapter 21.

It is unknown whether the ToM in schizophrenia deteriorates in the affected person as the condition progresses.&lt;ref name= brune /&gt;

The cognitive impairment linked to mind-blindness is best explained by a modular theory; the domain specific capabilities that account for mindreading and mentalization are lost in schizophrenia. Furthermore, Frith has predicted that the extent of mind-blindness depends on whether the objective/behavioural or subjective symptoms of ToM abilities prevail.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt; Patients with the behavioural symptoms perform the poorest in ToM tasks, similar to autistic subjects, while patients displaying subjective/experiential symptoms have a ToM. However, these patients are impaired in using contextual information to infer what these mental states are.&lt;ref name= brune /&gt;

=== Criticism ===
The mind-blindness theory helps to explain the impairment in the social development of individuals as well as the impairment in the communication skills of autistics. However one of the most important limitations of this theory is that it is unable to explain the highly repetitive behaviours which is a characteristic trait attributed to autistic people. This triad is explained through the process of systemising.&lt;ref name=cohen2 /&gt; The theory also did not account for the motor problems and the superior rote memory skills that were associated with autism.&lt;ref name=cory /&gt; These aspects along with the highly repetitive behaviours formed the triad of strengths. Simon Baron-Cohen himself has acknowledged that the theory, while adept at explaining the communications difficulties experienced by autistic people, fails to explain such patients' penchants for narrowly defined interests, an important step to proper diagnosis.  Furthermore, mind-blindness seems decidedly non-unique to autistic people, since conditions ranging from [[schizophrenia]] to various [[narcissistic personality disorder]]s and/or [[anti-social personality disorder]]s all exhibit mind-blindness to some degree.&lt;ref name="cohen" /&gt;

Another issue associated with the mind-blindness theory is that researchers are unable to predict whether the social deficits are a primary or secondary result of mind-blindness. In addition, Klin and his fellow researchers highlighted another limitation that was that the mind-blindness theory failed to delineate whether the ToM deficits are a generalised deficit or a specific discrete of a mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Klin, Ami., Folkmar, Fred R., Sparrow, Sara S.| title=Autistic Social Dysfunction: Some limitations of the Theory of Mind hypothesis | journal=Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry | publisher=Wiley-Blackwell | location=Hoboken, New Jersey | date=July 1992 | volume=33 | issue=5 | pages=861–876 | doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1992.tb01961.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stuart Shanker also argued in favour of Klin's argument, that a major part of the mind-blindness theory depicts the ToM as an autonomous cognitive capacity compared to being part of a more general ability for reflective thinking and empathy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Shanker | first=S. | title=The Roots of Mindblindness |journal=[[Theory &amp; Psychology]] | date=1 October 2004 | volume=14 | issue=5 | pages=685–703 | doi=10.1177/0959354304046179}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Autism-stacking-cans 2nd edit.jpg|thumb|A boy with autism, obsessively stacking cans.]]

Other researchers have pointed out the inherent flaws of assuming autistic traits develops from a "theory of mind" deficit, pointing out that this presupposes autistic traits derives from a single, core insufficiency within the brain.  This contrasts, they say, with the very same researchers' description of autism as a "puzzle", which implies a far more diverse range of causes than a single, unifying theory.&lt;ref name="smukler"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Smukler, David | title=Unauthorized Minds: How 'Theory of Mind' Theory Misrepresents Autism | journal=Mental Retardation | date=February 2005 | volume=43 | issue=1 | pages=11-24 | doi=10.1352/0047-6765(2005)43&lt;11:UMHTOM&gt;2.0.CO;2 | pmid=15628930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many have also pointed out that Mind-blindness wrongly categorizes autism as a problem to be fixed, rather than a condition to be accommodated. This assumes an inherent lack of [[intelligence]] in autistic people, which ignores the nuanced view of intelligence (as in varying types of intelligence) that has been observed in cognitive research.&lt;ref name="smukler" /&gt;

The drawbacks in the Mind-blindness theory of autistic people paved way for the [[Empathizing–systemizing theory|E-S theory]] which helps to explain the observations seen in these individuals. The E-S theory accounts for both the triad of deficits which is the loss of empathising and the triad of strengths is related to hyper systemisation of certain behaviours. The theory also helps to explain the exaggerated male spectrum termed as the extreme male behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Baron-Cohen | first=S. | author2=Knickmeyer, Rebecca S. | author3= Belmonte, Mathew S. | title=Sex Differences in the Brain: Implications for Explaining Autism | journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] | publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] | date=4 November 2005 | volume=310 | issue=5749 | pages=819–823 | doi=10.1126/science.1115455 | pmid=16272115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Music examinations''' are a method of formally assessing the accomplishments of pupils learning [[musical instruments]]. These are called grades.

Although there are music [[Test (assessment)|examination]]s available to [[school]] and [[university]] students alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also a number of independent bodies who solely provide assessment in musical ability which are open to all.

[[Trinity College London]] was the first organization to offer examinations in music to external students in 1877. As of 2012, Trinity College London conducts around 600,000 assessments worldwide per year, as does the [[Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music]]. Other examination boards based in the UK include the [[London College of Music Examinations|London College of Music]], [[Victoria College of Music and Drama]], the [[National College of Music]] and [[RSL (Rockschool Ltd.)|Rockschool]]&lt;ref&gt;https://www.rslawards.com/rockschool/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Many students who enter these exams have taken a course of [[music lesson]]s with a private tutor, although some are self-taught. Often this is a way for children to receive music training over and above what is provided at their usual place of learning, although private lessons are also popular with adults who turn to music later in life.

Music exams are set in both [[music theory|theory]] and practical aspects. The theory examinations are taken by pupils of all instruments and typically cover areas such as [[musical notation]], construction of [[major scale|scales]] and [[musical composition|composition]].

The practical exams concentrate on the particular instrument favored by the pupil, for example [[piano]], [[guitar]] or [[flute]]. They cover elements such as playing set pieces, technical work including [[Musical scale|scales]], [[sight reading]], aural, musical knowledge and improvisation.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the music exams are graded from 1 to 8, with Grade 1 being the entry level, and Grade 8 being the standard required for entry to higher study in a music college. Additionally, Trinity College London offers an Initial level qualification at Entry Level 3 of the UK Qualifications and Credit Framework, and ABRSM offer a Prep Test qualification as a useful preparation before the Grade 1 exam. LCM offers two Step exams at this level and VCM offers four Introductory grades aimed at those in the first 18 months of learning.

Other reputable music examination boards offering examinations on musical instruments and music theory include:
* [[Australian Music Examinations Board]]
* New Zealand Music Examinations Board
* Guitarmonk Examination Board, India
* Suro Bharati Sangeet Kala Kendra (Board of music and fine arts education), India
* [[The Royal Conservatory of Music]], Canada
* [[University of South Africa]] - Directorate Music
* Vienna Music Examination Board (''Wiener Musik-Prüfungskommission'')

Different music examination boards may have different grade levels for instruments and music theory examination. Depending on how they are recognised by regulatory bodies such as Ofqual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ofqual.gov.uk/ Ofqual]&lt;/ref&gt;, examination results or credits may be transferable from one exam board to the other.

A '''Persian carpet''' ({{lang-fa|فرش ايرانى}} ''farsh'', meaning "to spread") or '''Persian rug''' ([[Persian language|Persian]]: قالی ايرانى ''qālī-ye īranī''),&lt;ref name="Savory, R."&gt;Savory, R., ''Carpets'',([[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]); accessed January 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''Iranian carpet''', is a heavy textile, made for a wide variety of utilitarian and symbolic purpose, produced in [[Iran]] (historically known as [[Name of Iran|Persia]]), for home use, local sale, and export. Carpet weaving is an essential part of [[Persian culture]] and [[Iranian art]]. Within the group of [[Oriental rug]]s produced by the countries of the so-called '''"rug belt"''', the Persian carpet stands out by the variety and elaborateness of its manifold designs.

Persian carpets and rugs of various types were woven in parallel by nomadic tribes, in village and town workshops, and by royal court manufactories alike. As such, they represent different, simultaneous lines of tradition, and reflect the [[history of Iran]] and its various peoples. The carpets woven in the [[Safavid Empire|Safavid]] court manufactories of [[Isfahan]] during the sixteenth century are famous for their elaborate colours and artistical design, and are treasured in museums and private collections all over the world today. Their patterns and designs have set an artistic tradition for court manufactories which was kept alive during the entire duration of the Persian Empire up to the last royal dynasty of Iran.

Carpets woven in towns and regional centers like [[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]], [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]], [[Mashhad]], [[Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Nain rug|Nain]] and [[Qom rug|Qom]] are characterized by their specific weaving techniques and use of high-quality materials, colours and patterns. Town manufactories like those of [[Tabriz]] have played an important historical role in reviving the tradition of carpet weaving after periods of decline. Rugs woven by the villages and various tribes of Iran are distinguished by their fine wool, bright and elaborate colours, and specific, traditional patterns. Nomadic and small village weavers often produce rugs with bolder and sometimes more coarse designs, which are considered as the most authentic and traditional rugs of Persia, as opposed to the artistic, pre-planned designs of the larger workplaces. [[Gabbeh]] rugs are the best-known type of carpet from this line of tradition.

The art and craft of carpet weaving has gone through periods of decline during times of political unrest, or under the influence of commercial demands. It particularly suffered from the introduction of synthetic dyes during the second half of the nineteenth century. Carpet weaving still plays a major part in the economy of modern Iran. Modern production is characterized by the revival of traditional dyeing with [[natural dye]]s, the reintroduction of traditional tribal patterns, but also by the invention of modern and innovative designs, woven in the centuries-old technique. Hand-woven Persian carpets and rugs have been regarded as objects of high artistic and utilitarian value and prestige since the first time they were mentioned by ancient Greek writers.

Although the term "Persian carpet" most often refers to pile-woven textiles, flat-woven carpets and rugs like [[Kilim]], [[Soumak rug|Soumak]], and embroidered tissues like [[Suzani (textile)|Suzani]] are part of the rich and manifold tradition of Persian carpet weaving.

In 2010, the "traditional skills of carpet weaving" in [[Fars Province]] and [[Kashan rug|Kashan]] were inscribed to the [[UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00382|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/en/RL/00383|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The beginning of carpet weaving remains unknown, as carpets are subject to use, deterioration, and destruction by insects and rodents. Woven rugs probably developed from earlier floor coverings, made of '''[[felt]]''', or a technique known as "'''flat weaving'''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pinner|first1=R.|title=The First Carpets|journal=Hali|date=1983|volume=5|issue=2|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flat-woven rugs are made by tightly interweaving the [[warp and weft]] strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. The technique of weaving carpets further developed into a technique known as '''loop weaving'''. Loop weaving is done by pulling the weft strings over a gauge rod, creating loops of thread facing the weaver. The rod is then either removed, leaving the loops closed, or the loops are cut over the protecting rod, resulting in a rug very similar to a genuine [[pile rug]]. Hand-woven pile rugs are produced by knotting strings of thread individually into the warps, cutting the [[pile (textile)|thread]] after each single knot.

=== The Pazyryk carpet: Earliest pile-woven carpet ===
[[File:Pazyryk carpet.jpg|thumb|The [[Pazyryk burials#Pazyryk carpet|Pazyryk Carpet]]. Circa 400 BC. [[Hermitage Museum]]]]

The [[Pazyryk culture|Pazyryk]] carpet was excavated in 1949 from the grave of a [[Scythia]]n nobleman in the Pazyryk Valley of the [[Altai Mountains]] in [[Siberia]]. Radiocarbon testing indicated that the Pazyryk carpet was woven in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name="Haider, R."&gt;Haider, R., ''Carpet that Captive''&lt;/ref&gt; This carpet is {{convert|183|x|200|cm|abbr=off}} and has 36 symmetrical [[knot density|knots per]] cm² (232 per inch²).&lt;ref&gt;Nouri-Zadeh, Sh., ''Turkish Carpet; The Beautiful Picture of Art in History'',&lt;/ref&gt; The advanced technique used in the Pazyryk carpet indicates a long history of evolution and experience in weaving. It is considered the oldest known carpet in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinson, Karen S., ''"Animal Style" Art &amp; the Image of the Horse and Rider''&lt;/ref&gt; Its central field is a deep red color and it has two animal frieze borders proceeding in opposite directions accompanied by guard stripes. The inner main border depicts a procession of deer, the outer men on horses, and men leading horses. The horse saddlecloths are woven in different designs. The inner field contains 4 x 6 identical square frames arranged in rows on a red ground, each filled by identical, star shaped ornaments made up by centrally overlapping x- and cross-shaped patterns. The design of the carpet already shows the basic arrangement of what was to become the standard oriental carpet design: A field with repeating patterns, framed by a main border in elaborate design, and several secondary borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=ḎḤWTY|title=2,500-Year-Old Carpet is Stunning Reflection of Advanced Culture of the Pazyryk Nomads|url=http://www.ancient-origins.net/artifacts-other-artifacts/2500-year-old-carpet-stunning-reflection-advanced-culture-pazyryk-nomads-021858|website=Ancient Origins|accessdate=31 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The discoverer of the Pazyryk carpet, [[Sergei Rudenko]], assumed it to be a product of the contemporary [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenids]].&lt;ref&gt;S.I. Rudenko, ''Kul'tura naseleniia Gornogo Altaia v skifskoe vremia'' (Moscow and Leningrad, 1953)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rudenko, Sergei I., Frozen Tombs of Siberia, The Pazyryk Burials of Iron-Age Horseman (University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether it was produced in the region where it was found, or is a product of Achaemenid manufacture, remains subject to debate.&lt;ref&gt;Lerner J., ''Some So-called Achaemenid Objects from Pazyryk'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, vol. 10, no. 4:8-15 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harald Böhmer and Jon Thompson, ''The Pazyryk Carpet: A Technical Discussion'', Source: Notes in the History of Art, vol. 10, no. 4:30-36 (1991).&lt;/ref&gt; Its fine weaving and elaborate pictorial design hint at an advanced state of the art of carpet weaving at the time of its production.

=== Early fragments ===
There are documentary records of carpets being used by the ancient Greeks. [[Homer]], assumed to have lived around 850 BC, writes in [[Ilias]] XVII,350 that the body of Patroklos is covered with a "splendid carpet". In [[Odyssey]] Book VII and X "carpets" are mentioned. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote ([[Natural History (Pliny)|nat. VIII, 48]]) that carpets ("polymita") were invented in Alexandria. It is unknown whether these were flatweaves or pile weaves, as no detailed technical information is provided in the Greek and Latin texts.

Flat-woven [[kilim]]s dating to at least the fourth or fifth century AD were found in [[Turfan]], [[Hotan|Hotan prefecture]], East Turkestan, China, an area which still produces carpets today. Rug fragments were also found in the [[Lop Nur]] area, and are woven in symmetrical knots, with 5-7 interwoven wefts after each row of knots, with a striped design, and various colours.

These rare findings demonstrate that all the skills and techniques of dyeing and carpet weaving were already known in western Asia before the first century AD.

=== Early history: circa 500 BC – 200 AD ===
Persian carpets were first mentioned around 400 BC, by the Greek author [[Xenophon]] in his book "[[Anabasis (Xenophon)|Anabasis]]":

&lt;blockquote&gt;"αὖθις δὲ Τιμασίωνι τῷ Δαρδανεῖ προσελθών, ἐπεὶ ἤκουσεν αὐτῷ εἶναι καὶ ἐκπώματα καὶ τάπιδας βαρβαρικάς", (Xen. anab. VII.3.18)
: ''Next he went to Timasion the Dardanian, for he heard that he had some Persian drinking cups and carpets.''
"καὶ Τιμασίων προπίνων ἐδωρήσατο φιάλην τε ἀργυρᾶν καὶ τάπιδα ἀξίαν δέκα μνῶν." [Xen. anab. VII.3.27]
: ''Timasion also drank his health and presented him with a silver bowl and a carpet worth ten mines.''&lt;ref&gt;[[:s:Κύρου Ανάβασις/Ζ|Κύρου Ανάβασις/Ζ]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Xenophon describes Persian (lit.: "barbarian", meaning: non-Greek) carpets as precious, and worthy to be used as diplomatic gifts. It is unknown if these carpets were pile-woven, or produced by another technique, e.g., [[kilim|flat-weaving]], or [[embroidery]], but it is interesting that the very first reference to Persian carpets in the world literature already puts them into a context of luxury, prestige, and diplomacy.

There are no surviving Persian carpets from the reigns of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenian]] (553–330 BC), [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] (312–129 BC), and [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] (ca. 170 BC – 226 AD) kings.

=== The Sasanian Empire: 224–651 ===

The [[Sasanian Empire]], which succeeded the [[Parthian Empire]], was recognized as one of the leading powers of its time, alongside its neighbouring [[Byzantine Empire]], for a period of more than 400 years.&lt;ref&gt;International Congress of Byzantine Studies ''Proceedings of the 21st International Congress of Byzantine Studies, London, 21–26 August 2006, Volumes 1–3'' pp 29. Ashgate Pub Co, 30 sep. 2006 {{ISBN|075465740X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sasanids established their empire roughly within the borders set by the Achaemenids, with the capital at [[Ctesiphon]]. This last Persian dynasty before the arrival of [[Islam]] adopted [[Zoroastrianism]] as the state religion.

When and how exactly the Persians started weaving pile carpets is currently unknown, but the knowledge of carpet weaving, and of suitable designs for floor coverings, was certainly available in the area covering Byzance, Anatolia, and Persia: [[History of Anatolia|Anatolia]], located between Byzance and Persia, was ruled by the Roman Empire since 133 BCE. Geographically and politically, by changing alliances and warfare as well as by trade, Anatolia connected the East Roman with the Persian Empire. Artistically, both empires have developed similar styles and decorative vocabulary, as exemplified by mosaics and architecture of Roman [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Masterpieces Islamic Art, 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekthiar|first1=MD|last2=Soucek|first2=PP|last3=Canby|first3=SR|last4=Haidar|first4=NN|title=Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2012|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-58839-434-7|pages=20–24|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Turkish carpet pattern depicted on [[Jan van Eyck]]'s [[Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele|"Paele Madonna"]] painting was traced back to late Roman origins and related to early Islamic floor mosaics found in the Umayyad palace of [[Hisham's Palace|Khirbat al-Mafjar]].&lt;ref name="Brüggemann, Orientteppich 2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brüggemann|first1=Werner|title=Der Orientteppich/The Oriental Carpet|date=2007|publisher=Dr Ludwig Reichert Verlag|location=Wiesbaden, Germany|isbn=978-3-89500-563-3|pages=87–176|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Flat weaving and embroidery were known during the Sasanian period. Elaborate Sasanian silk textiles were well preserved in European churches, where they were used as coverings for relics, and survived in church treasuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=N. (no author)|first1=N.|title=Splendeur des Sassanides: L'empire Perse entre Rome et la Chine (224-642) / the Splendor of the Sassanians: the Persian Empire between Rome and China (224-642)|date=1993|publisher=Credit Communal|location=Brussels}}&lt;/ref&gt; More of these textiles were preserved in Tibetan monasteries, and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Chinese cultural revolution]], or excavated from burial sites like Astana, on the [[Silk Road]] near [[Turpan|Turfan]]. The high artistic level reached by Persian weavers is further exemplified by the report of the historian [[Al-Tabari]] about the [[Baharestan Carpet|Spring of Khosrow]] carpet, taken as booty by the Arabian conquerors of Ctesiphon in 637 AD. The description of the rug's design by al-Tabari makes it seem unlikely that the carpet was pile woven.&lt;ref name="Antique Rugs from the Near East"&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|last2=Kühnel|first2=Ernst|title=Vorderasiatische Knüpfteppiche = Antique Rugs from the Near East, tr.

Fragments of pile rugs from findspots in north-eastern [[Afghanistan]], reportedly originating from the province of [[Samangan Province|Samangan]], have been carbon-14 dated to a time span from the turn of the second century to the early Sasanian period. Among these fragments, some show depictions of animals, like various stags (sometimes arranged in a procession, recalling the design of the Pazyryk carpet) or a winged mythical creature. Wool is used for warp, weft, and pile, the yarn is crudely spun, and the fragments are woven with the asymmetric knot associated with Persian and far-eastern carpets. Every three to five rows, pieces of unspun wool, strips of cloth and leather are woven in.&lt;ref name="Carpets from Islamic Lands"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Carpets from Islamic Lands|date=2012|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson|location=London|isbn=978-0-500-97043-0|pages=14–19|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fragments are now in the [[House of Sabah|Al-Sabah]] Collection in the [[Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah]], [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="darmuseum.org.kw"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuwait Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah rugs and textiles collection|url=http://darmuseum.org.kw/the-collections/rugs-textiles/|website=Dar al-Athar al-Islamiyyah|accessdate=25 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The carpet fragments, although reliably dated to the early Sasanian time, do not seem to be related to the splendid court carpets described by the Arab conquerors. Their crude knots incorporating [[Shag (fabric)|shag]] on the reverse hints at the need for increased insulation. With their coarsely finished animal and hunting depictions, these carpets were likely woven by nomadic people.&lt;ref name="Spuhler, Pre-Islamic carpets 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spuhler|first1=Friedrich|title=Pre-Islamic carpets and textiles from eastern lands.|date=2013|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=Farnborough|isbn=9780500970546|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The advent of Islam and the Caliphates: 651–1258 ===
The [[Muslim conquest of Persia]] led to the end of the Sasanian Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Persia. Persia became a part of the Islamic world, ruled by Muslim [[Caliphate]]s.

Arabian geographers and historians visiting Persia provide, for the first time, references to the use of carpets on the floor. The unknown author of the [[Hudud al-'Alam]] states that rugs were woven in Fārs. 100 years later, [[Al-Muqaddasi]] refers to carpets in the Qaināt. [[Yaqut al-Hamawi]] tells us that carpets were woven in [[Azerbaijan (Iran)|Azerbaijān]] in the thirteenth century. The great Arabian traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] mentions that a green rug was spread before him when he visited the winter quarter of the Bakhthiari [[atabeg]] in [[Izeh|Idhej]]. These references indicate that carpet weaving in Persia under the Caliphate was a tribal or rural industry.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Edwards|first1=A. Cecil|title=The Persian carpet : a survey of the carpet-weaving industry of Persia|date=1975|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|isbn=978-0715602560|edition=Reprinted 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rule of the Caliphs over Persia ended when the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was overthrown in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] by the [[Mongol Empire]] under [[Hulagu Khan]]. The Abbasid line of rulers recentered themselves in the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk]] capital of [[Cairo]] in 1261. Though lacking in political power, the dynasty continued to claim authority in religious matters until after the [[Ottoman dynasty|Ottoman]] [[Ottoman–Mamluk War (1516–17)|conquest of Egypt]] (1517). Under the Mamluk dynasty in Cairo, large carpets known as "Mamluk carpets" were produced.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Mamluks"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Kairener Teppiche Teil I.

=== Seljuq invasion and Turko-Persian tradition: 1040–1118 ===
{{see also|Turkish carpet}}

Beginning at latest with the [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuq]] invasions of Anatolia and northwestern Persia, a distinct [[Turko-Persian tradition]] emerged. Fragments of woven carpets were found in the [[Alâeddin Mosque]] in the Turkish town of [[Konya]] and the [[Eşrefoğlu Mosque]] in [[Beyşehir]], and were dated to the Anatolian Seljuq Period (1243–1302).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martin|first1=F.R.|title=A History of Oriental Carpets before 1800|date=1908|publisher=Printed for the author in the I. and R.

The Egyptian findings also provide evidence for export trade. If, and how, these carpets influenced Persian carpet weaving, remains unknown, as no distinct Persian carpets are known to exist from this period, or we are unable to identify them. It was assumed by Western scholars that the Sejuqs may have introduced at least new design traditions, if not the craft of pile weaving itself, to Persia, where skilled artisans and craftsmen might have integrated new ideas into their old traditions.&lt;ref name="Antique Rugs from the Near East"/&gt;

=== The Mongol Ilkhanate (1256–1335) and Timurid Empire (1370–1507) ===
[[File:DiezAlbumsStudyingTheKoran.jpg|thumb|A Mongol prince studying the Koran. Illustration of Rashid-ad-Din's Gami' at-tawarih. Tabriz (?), 1st quarter of 14th century]]
Between 1219 and 1221, Persia was raided by the [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]]. After 1260, the title [[Ilkhanate|"Ilkhan"]] was borne by the descendants of [[Hulagu Khan]] and later other Borjigin princes in Persia. At the end of the thirteenth century, [[Ghazan]] Khan built a new capital at Shãm, near Tabriz. He ordered the floors of his residence to be covered with carpets from Fārs.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

With the death of Ilkhan Abu Said Bahatur in 1335, Mongol rule faltered and Persia fell into political anarchy. In 1381, [[Timur]] invaded Iran and became the founder of the [[Timurid Empire]]. His successors, the Timurids, maintained a hold on most of Iran until they had to submit to the [[Ag Qoyunlu|"White Sheep" Turkmen]] confederation under [[Uzun Hassan]] in 1468; Uzun Hasan and his successors were the masters of Iran until the rise of the Safavids.

In 1463, the Venetian Senate, seeking allies in the [[Ottoman–Venetian War (1463–1479)]] established diplomatic relations with Uzun Hassans court at Tabriz. In 1473, [[Giosafat Barbaro]] was sent to Tabriz. In his reports to the Senate of Venetia he mentions more than once the splendid carpets which he saw at the palace. Some of them, he wrote, were of silk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=Lettere%20al%20senato%20veneto%20annotate%20per%20E.%20Cornet%20giosafat%20barbaro|title=Worldcat|accessdate=8 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1403-05 [[Ruy González de Clavijo]] was the ambassador of [[Henry III of Castile]] to the court of [[Timur]], founder and ruler of the [[Timurid Empire]]. He described that in Timur's palace at [[Samarkand]], "everywhere the floor was covered with carpets and reed mattings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Clavijo|first1=Ruy Gonzáles|editor1-last=Le Strange|editor1-first=Guy|title=Embassy to Tamerlane, 1403-1406|date=2009|publisher=Hardinge Simpole|location=Kilkerran|isbn=978-1843821984}}&lt;/ref&gt; Timurid period miniatures show carpets with geometrical designs, rows of octagons and stars, knot forms, and borders sometimes derived from [[kufic]] script. None of the carpets woven before 1500 AD have survived.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Safavid Period (1501–1732) ===

In 1499, a new dynasty arose in Persia. Shah [[Ismail I]], its founder, was related to Uzun Hassan. He is regarded as the first national sovereign of Persia since the Arab conquest, and established [[Shia Islam|Shi'a Islam]] as the state religion of Persia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savory|first1=Roger|title=Iran under the Safavids|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=978-0521042512|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and his successors, Shah [[Tahmasp I]] and Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] became patrons of the Persian [[Safavid art]]. Court manufactories were probably established by Shah Tahmasp in Tabriz, but definitely by Shah Abbas when he moved his capital from Tabriz in northwestern to [[Isfahan]] in central Persia, in the wake of the [[Ottoman–Safavid War (1603–18)]]. For the art of carpet weaving in Persia, this meant, as Edwards wrote: "that in a short time it rose from a cottage ''métier'' to the dignity of a fine art."&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The time of the [[Safavid dynasty]] marks one of the greatest periods in [[Iranian art|Persian art]], which includes carpet weaving. Later Safavid period carpets still exist, which belong to the finest and most elaborate weavings known today. The phenomenon that the first carpets physically known to us show such accomplished designs leads to the assumption that the art and craft of carpet weaving must already have existed for some time before the magnificent Safavid court carpets could have been woven. As no early Safavid period carpets survived, research has focused on Timurid period book illuminations and [[Persian miniature|miniature]] paintings. These paintings depict colourful carpets with repeating designs of equal-scale geometric patterns, arranged in checkerboard-like designs, with "kufic" border ornaments derived from [[Islamic calligraphy]]. The designs are so similar to period Anatolian carpets, especially to "[[Holbein carpet]]s" that a common source of the design cannot be excluded: Timurid designs may have survived in both the Persian and Anatolian carpets from the early Safavid, and Ottoman period.&lt;ref name="Briggs, Timurid carpets"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Briggs|first1=Amy|title=Timurid Carpets; I. Geometric carpets|journal=Ars Islamica|date=1940|volume=7|pages=20–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The "design revolution" ====
By the late fifteenth century, the design of the carpets depicted in miniatures changed considerably. Large-format medaillons appeared, ornaments began to show elaborate curvilinear designs. Large spirals and tendrils, floral ornaments, depictions of flowers and animals, were often mirrored along the long or short axis of the carpet to obtain harmony and rhythm. The earlier "kufic" border design was replaced by tendrils and [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|arabesques]]. All these patterns required a more elaborate system of weaving, as compared to weaving straight, rectilinear lines. Likewise, they require artists to create the design, weavers to execute them on the loom, and an efficient way to communicate the artist's ideas to the weaver. Today this is achieved by a template, termed cartoon (Ford, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;170&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ford|first1=P.R.J.|title=Oriental Carpet Design|date=1981|publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd.|location=London|isbn=9780500276648|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;). How Safavid manufacturers achieved this, technically, is currently unknown. The result of their work, however, was what [[Kurt Erdmann]] termed the '''"carpet design revolution"'''.&lt;ref name="Erdmann"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=30–32|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently, the new designs were developed first by miniature painters, as they started to appear in book illuminations and on book covers as early as in the fifteenth century. This marks the first time when the "classical" design of Islamic rugs was established: The medaillon and corner design (pers.: "Lechek Torūnj") was first seen on book covers. In 1522, Ismail I employed the miniature painter [[Kamāl ud-Dīn Behzād]], a famous painter of the Herat school, as director of the royal atelier. Behzad had a decisive impact on the development of later Safavid art. The Safavid carpets known to us differ from the carpets as depicted in the miniature paintings, so the paintings cannot support any efforts to differentiate, classify and date period carpets. The same holds true for European paintings: Unlike Anatolian carpets, Persian carpets were not depicted in European paintings before the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|editor1-last=Erdmann|editor1-first=Hanna|editor2-last=Beattie (transl.)|editor2-first=May H.|title=Seven hundred years of Oriental carpets.|date=1970|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=978-0520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt; As some carpets like the [[Ardabil carpet]]s have inwoven inscriptions including dates, scientific efforts to categorize and date Safavid rugs start from them:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;I have no refuge in the world other than thy threshold.&lt;br/&gt;There is no protection for my head other than this door.''&lt;br/&gt;''The work of the slave of the threshold Maqsud of Kashan in the year 946.&lt;/blockquote&gt; |''Inwoven inscription of the Ardabil carpet''}}

The AH year of 946 corresponds to AD 1539-40, which dates the Ardabil carpet to the reign of Shah Tahmasp, who donated the carpet to the shrine of Shaykh [[Safi-ad-din Ardabili]] in [[Ardabil]], who is regarded as the spiritual father of the Safavid dynasty.

Another inscription can be seen on the "Hunting Carpet", now at the [[Museo Poldi Pezzoli]], Milan, which dates the carpet to 949 AH/AD 1542–3:

{{Quotation|&lt;blockquote&gt;By the diligence of Ghyath ud-Din Jami was completed&lt;br/&gt;This renowned work, that appeals to us by its beauty&lt;br/&gt;In the year 949&lt;/blockquote&gt; |''Inwoven inscription of the Milan Hunting carpet''}}

[[File:Embassy to Europe.jpg|thumb|Shah 'Abbas I. embassy to Venice, by [[Carlo Caliari]], 1595. Doge's palace, Venice]]

The number of sources for more precise dating and the attribution of provenience increase during the 17th century. Safavid carpets were presented as diplomatic gifts to European cities and states, as diplomatic relations intensified. In 1603, Shah Abbas presented a carpet with inwoven gold and silver threads to the Venetian doge [[Marino Grimani (doge)|Marino Grimani]]. European noblemen began ordering carpets directly from the manufactures of Isfahan and Kashan, whose weavers were willing to weave specific designs, like European coats of arms, into the commissioned peces. Their acquisition was sometimes meticulously documented: In 1601, the [[Armenia]]n Sefer Muratowicz was sent to Kashan by the Polish king [[Sigismund III Vasa]] in order to commission 8 carpets with the Polish royal court of arms to be inwoven. The Kashan weavers did so, and on 12 September 1602 Muratowicz presented the carpets to the Polish king, and the bill to the treasurer of the crown.&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"/&gt; Representative Safavid carpets made of silk with inwoven gold and silver threads were erroneously believed by Western art historians to be of Polish manufacture. Although the error was corrected, carpets of this type retained the name of "Polish" or "Polonaise" carpets. The more appropriate type name of "Shah Abbas" carpets was suggested by [[Kurt Erdmann]].&lt;ref name="Erdmann 1966"/&gt;

==== Safavid "Vase technique" carpets from Kirmān ====
[[File:Sanguszko carpet 01.jpg|thumb|"Sanguszko carpet", Kirmān, 16/17th century. [[Miho Museum]]]]
[[File:Safavid tilework MKG Hamburg.jpg|thumb|Tiled arch with hunting scenes. Late 17th century, Isfahan/Iran. [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe]], Hamburg]]

A distinct group of Safavid carpets can be attributed to the region of Kirmān in southern Persia. May H. Beattie identified these carpets by their common structure:&lt;ref name="Beattie, 1976"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beattie|first1=May H.|title=Carpets of Central Persia : with special references to rugs of Kirman.|date=1976|publisher=World of Islam Festival Pub. Co.|location=[S.l.]|isbn=0905035178|pages=19–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven different types of carpets were identified: Garden carpets (depicting formal gardens and water channels); carpets with centralized designs, characterized by a large medallion; multiple-medaillon designs with offset medaillons and compartment repeats; directional designs with the arrangements of little scenes used as individual motifs; sickle-leaf designs where long, curved, serrated and sometimes compound leaves dominate the field; arabesque; and lattice designs. Their distinctive structure consists of asymmetric knots; the cotton warps are depressed, and there are three wefts. The first and third weft are made of wool, and lie hidden in the center of the carpet. The middle weft is of silk or cotton, and passes from the back to the front. When the carpets are worn, this third weft evokes a characteristic, "tram line" effect.

The best known "vase technique" carpets from Kirmān are those of the so-called "Sanguszko group", named after the [[House of Sanguszko]], whose collection has the most outstanding example. The medallion-and-corner design is similar to other 16th century Safavid carpets, but the colours and style of drawing are distinct. In the central medallion, pairs of human figures in smaller medallions surround a central animal combat scene. Other animal combats are depicted in the field, while horsemen are shown in the corner medallions. The main border also contains lobed medallions with [[Houri]]s, animal combats, or confronting peacocks. In-between the border medallions, phoenixes and dragons are fighting. By similarity to mosaic tile spandrels in the [[Ganjali Khan Complex]] at the Kirmān bazaar with an inscription recording its date of completion as 1006 AH/AD 1596, they are dated to the end of the 16th or the beginning of the 17th century.&lt;ref name="Ferrier, 1989"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferrier|first1=R.W.|title=The arts of Persia|date=1989|publisher=Yale Univ.

Carpets in the Safavid tradition were still woven in Kirmān after the fall of the Safavid dynasty in 1732 (Ferrier, 1989, p.&amp;nbsp;127&lt;ref name="Ferrier, 1989"/&gt;).

The end of [[Shah Abbas II]]'s reign in 1666 marked the beginning of the end of the Safavid dynasty. The declining country was repeatedly raided on its frontiers. Finally, a [[Ghilzai]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] chieftain named [[Mirwais Khan Hotak|Mir Wais Khan]] began a rebellion in [[Kandahar]] and defeated the Safavid army under the Iranian Georgian governor over the region, [[Gurgin Khan]]. In 1722, [[Peter the Great]] launched the [[Russo-Persian War (1722-1723)]], capturing many of Iran's Caucasian territories, including [[Derbent]], [[Sheki, Azerbaijan|Shaki]], [[Baku]], but also [[Gilan]], [[Mazandaran]] and [[Astrabad]]. In 1722, an Afghan army led by [[Mir Mahmud Hotaki]] marched across eastern Iran, and [[Siege of Isfahan|besieged and took Isfahan]]. Mahmud proclaimed himself 'Shah' of Persia. Meanwhile, Persia's imperial rivals, the Ottomans and the Russians, took advantage of the chaos in the country to seize more territory for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Axworthy|first1=Michael|title=The sword of Persia : Nader Shah, from tribal warrior to conquering tyrant|date=2008|publisher=I.

=== The Afsharid (1736–1796) and Zand (1750–1796) dynasties ===
[[File:North West Persian Runner detail.jpg|thumb|North West Persian Runner (detail), late 18th century|upright]]
Iran's territorial integrity was restored by a native Iranian [[Turkic people|Turkic]] [[Afsharid|Afshar]] warlord from Khorasan, [[Nader Shah]]. He defeated the Afghans, and [[Ottoman–Persian War (1730–35)|Ottomans]], [[Restoration of Tahmasp II to the Safavid throne|reinstalled]] the Safavids on the throne, and negotiated Russian withdrawal from Irans Caucasian territories, by the [[Treaty of Resht]] and [[Treaty of Ganja]]. By 1736, Nader himself was crowned shah. There are no records of carpet weaving, which had sunk to an insignificant handicraft, during the [[Afsharid dynasty|Afsharid]] and [[Zand dynasty|Zand]] dynasties.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Qajãr dynasty (1789–1925) ===
In 1789, [[Mohammad Khan Qajar]] was crowned king of Persia, the founder of the [[Qajar dynasty]], which provided Persia with a long period of order and comparative peace, and the industry had an opportunity of revival. The three important Qajãr monarchs [[Fath-Ali Shah Qajar]], [[Naser al-Din Shah Qajar]], and [[Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar]] revived the ancient traditions of the Persian monarchy. The weavers of Tabriz took the opportunity, and around 1885 became the founders of the modern industry of carpet weaving in Persia.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) ===
In the aftermath of the [[Russian Revolution]], Persia had become a battleground. In 1917, Britain used Iran as the springboard for an attack into Russia in an [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|unsuccessful attempt]] to reverse the Revolution. The [[Soviet Union]] responded by annexing portions of northern Persia, creating the [[Persian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. By 1920, the Iranian government had lost virtually all power outside its capital: British and Soviet forces exercised control over most of the Iranian mainland.

In 1925 Rezā Shāh, supported by the British government, deposed [[Ahmad Shah Qajar]], the last [[Shah]] of the [[Qajar dynasty]], and founded the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. He established a constitutional monarchy that lasted until the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979. Reza Shah introduced social, economic, and political reforms, ultimately laying the foundation of the modern Iranian state. In order to stabilize and legitimate their reign, Rezā Shāh and his son [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] aimed at reviving ancient Persian traditions. The revival of carpet weaving, often referring to traditional designs, was an important part of these efforts. In 1935, Rezā Shāh founded the Iran Carpet Company, and brought carpet weaving under government control. Elaborate carpets were woven for export, and as diplomatic gifts to other states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hillmann|first1=Michael Craig|title=A cultural-aesthetic analysis of a modern Persian carpet|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1989|volume=9|issue=6|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pahlavi dynasty modernized and centralized the Iranian government, and sought effective control and authority over all their subjects. Reza Shah was the first Persian monarch to confront this challenge with modern weapons. Enforced by the army, nomadism was outlawed during the 1930s, traditional tribal dresses were banned, the use of tents and yurts was forbidden in Iran. Unable to migrate, having lost their herds, many nomadic families starved to death. A brief era of relative peace followed for the nomadic tribes in the 1940s and 1950s, when Persia was involved in the Second World War, and Rezā Shāh was forced to abdicate in 1941. His successor, Mohammed Reza Shah consolidated his power during the 1950s. His land reform program of 1962, part of the so-called [[White Revolution]], despite obvious advantages for landless peasants, destroyed the traditional political organization of nomadic tribes like the [[Qashqai people]], and the traditional way of nomadic life. The centuries-old traditions of nomadic carpet weaving, which had entered a process of decline with the introduction of synthetic dyes and commercial designs in the late nineteenth century, were almost annihilated by the politics of the last Iranian imperial dynasty.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"/&gt;

=== Modern times ===
[[File:Tabriz Lilac.jpg|thumb|Modern Iranian Carpet "Tabriz Lilac", 2010, by Hossein Rezvani]]
[[File:TapisGabbeh.png|thumb|A modern gabbeh carpet]]

After the [[Iranian Revolution]], little information could at first be obtained about carpet weaving in Iran. In the 1970s and 1980s, a new interest arose in Europe in [[Gabbeh]] rugs, which were initially woven by nomadic tribes for their own use. Their coarse weaving and simple, abstract designs appealed to Western customers.

In 1992, the first Grand Persian Conference and Exhibition in Tehran presented for the first time modern Persian carpet designs. Persian master weavers like Razam Arabzadeh displayed carpets woven in the traditional technique, but with unusual, modern designs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. III|title=Persian design: A step forward|journal=The Decorative Rug|date=1994|volume=7|issue=9|pages=40–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Grand Conferences continue to take place at regular intervals, two trends can be observed in Iranian carpet weaving today. On the one hand, modern and innovative artistic designs are invented and developed by Iranian manufacturers, who thus take the ancient design tradition forward towards the twenty-first century. On the other hand, the renewed interest in natural dyes&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Vegetal Dyes: Iran restores an ancient tradition.|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1992|volume=III|issue=10|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; was taken up by commercial enterprises, which commission carpets to tribal village weavers. This provides a regular source of income for the carpet weavers. The companies usually provide the material and specify the designs, but the weavers are allowed some degree of creative freedom. With the end of the U.S. [[Sanctions against Iran|embargo]] on Iranian goods, also Persian carpets (including antique Persian carpets acquired at auctions) may become more easily available to U.S. customers again.

As commercial household goods, Persian carpets today are encountering competition from other countries with lower wages and cheaper methods of production: Machine-woven, [[Tufting|tufted]] rugs, or rugs woven by hand, but with the faster and less costly loop weaving method, provide rugs in "oriental" designs of utilitarian, but no artistic value. Traditional hand woven carpets, made of sheep wool dyed with natural colours are increasingly sought after. They are usually sold at higher prices due to the large amount of manual work associated with their production, which has, essentially, not changed since ancient times, and due to the artistic value of their design. Thus, the Persian carpet retains its ancient status as an object of luxury, beauty, and art.

== Materials ==

=== Wool ===
In most Persian rugs, the pile is of [[Sheep|sheep's]] wool. Its characteristics and quality vary from each area to the next, depending on the breed of sheep, climatic conditions, pasturage, and the particular customs relating to when and how the wool is shorn and processed.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Murray L. Jr.|last2=Eilland|first2=Murray III|title=Oriental Rugs - A Complete Guide|date=1998|publisher=Callmann &amp; King Ltd.|location=London|edition=revised}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different areas of a sheep's fleece yield different qualities of wool, depending on the ratio between the thicker and stiffer sheep hair and the finer fibers of the wool. Usually, sheep are [[Sheep shearing|shorn]] in spring and fall. The spring shear produces wool of finer quality. The lowest grade of wool used in carpet weaving is "skin" wool, which is removed chemically from dead animal skin.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; Higher grades of Persian wool are often referred to as '''kurk''', or '''kork''' wool, which is gained from the wool growing on the sheep's neck.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Modern production also makes use of imported wool, e.g. [[Merino]] wool from [[New Zealand]], because the high demand on carpet wool cannot be entirely met by the local production. Fibers from [[camel]]s and [[goat]]s are also used. Goat hair is mainly used for fastening the borders, or selvedges, of nomadic rugs like [[Baloch people|Baluch]] rugs, since it is more resistant to abrasion. Camel wool is occasionally used in Persian nomadic rugs. It is often dyed in black, or used in its natural colour. More often, wool said to be camel's wool turns out to be dyed sheep wool.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

=== Cotton ===
[[Cotton]] forms the foundation of warps and wefts of the majority of modern rugs. Nomads who cannot afford to buy cotton on the market use wool for warps and wefts, which are also traditionally made of wool in areas where cotton was not a local product. Cotton can be spun more tightly than wool, and tolerates more tension, which makes cotton a superior material for the foundation of a rug. Especially larger carpets are more likely to lie flat on the floor, whereas wool tends to shrink unevenly, and carpets with a woolen foundation may buckle when wet.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; Chemically treated ([[Mercerised cotton|mercerised]]) cotton has been used in rugs as a silk substitute since the late nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

=== Silk ===
[[Silk]] is an expensive material, and has been used for representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short pile and an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as [[Tapestries|wall hangings]], or pillows.

=== Spinning ===
{{see also|Hand spinning|Spinning (textiles)}}
[[File:Yarn twist S-Left Z-Right.svg|thumb|upright|50px|S-twist and Z-twist yarns]]

The fibers of wool, cotton, and silk are spun either by hand or mechanically by using [[spinning wheel]]s or industrial [[Spinning frame|spinning machines]] to produce the yarn. The direction in which the yarn is spun is called ''twist''. Yarns are characterized as S-twist or Z-twist according to the direction of spinning (see diagram).&lt;ref&gt;Kadolph, Sara J., ed.: ''Textiles'', 10th edition, Pearson/Prentice-Hall, 2007, {{ISBN|0-13-118769-4}}, p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; Two or more spun yarns may be twisted together or ''[[plying|plied]]'' to form a thicker yarn. Generally, handspun single plies are spun with a Z-twist, and plying is done with an S-twist. Like nearly all Islamic rugs with the exception of Mamluk carpets, nearly all Persian rugs use "Z" (anti-clockwise) spun and "S" (clockwise)-plied wool.

=== Dyeing ===
[[File:Carpet factory.jpg|thumb|Naturally dyed wool in a Turkish carpet manufacture]]

The dyeing process involves the preparation of the yarn in order to make it susceptible for the proper dyes by immersion in a [[mordant]]. Dyestuffs are then added to the yarn which remains in the dyeing solution for a defined time. The dyed yarn is then left to dry, exposed to air and sunlight. Some colours, especially dark brown, require iron mordants, which can damage or fade the fabric. This often results in faster pile wear in areas dyed in dark brown colours, and may create a relief effect in antique oriental carpets.

==== Plants ====
[[Natural dye|Traditional dyes]] used in Persian rugs are obtained from plants and insects. In 1856, the English chemist [[William Henry Perkin]] invented the first [[aniline]] dye, [[mauveine]]. A variety of other synthetic [[dyes]] were invented thereafter. Cheap, readily prepared and easy to use as they were compared to natural dyes, their use is documented since the mid 1860s. The tradition of natural dyeing was revived in Turkey in the early 1980s. Chemical analyses led to the identification of natural dyes from antique wool samples, and dyeing recipes and processes were experimentally re-created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Boehmer|first1=Harald|title=The Revival of Natural Dyeing in Two Traditional Weaving Areas of Anatolia|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1983|volume=III|issue=9|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Atlihan|first1=Serife|title=Traditional Weaving in One Village of Settled Nomads in Northwest Anatolia|journal=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies|date=1993|volume=IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to these analyses, natural dyes used for carpet wool include:
* ''Red'' from [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] roots,
* ''Yellow'' from plants, including [[Onion|onion (Allium cepa)]], several chamomile species ([[Anthemis]], [[Matricaria chamomilla]]), and [[Euphorbia]],
* ''Black'': [[Oak apple]]s, [[Oak|Oak acorns]], [[Rhus coriaria|Tanner's sumach]],
* ''Green'' by double dyeing with [[Indigo]] and yellow dye,
* ''Orange'' by double dyeing with madder red and yellow dye,
* ''Blue'': [[Indigo]] gained from [[Indigofera tinctoria]].
Some of the dyestuffs like indigo or madder were goods of trade, and thus commonly available. Yellow or brown dyestuffs more substantially vary from region to region. Many plants provide yellow dyes, like Vine weld, or Dyer's weed ''([[Reseda luteola]])'', Yellow larkspur, or Dyer's sumach [[Cotinus coggygria]]. Grape leaves and pomegranate rinds, as well as other plants, provide different shades of yellow.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

In Iran, traditional dyeing with natural dyes was revived in the 1990s, inspired by the renewed general interest in traditionally produced rugs, but master dyers like Abbas Sayahi had kept alive the knowledge about the traditional recipes.&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt;

==== Insect reds ====
[[Carmine]] dyes are obtained from resinous secretions of scale insects such as the [[Cochineal]] scale [[Coccus cacti]], and certain Porphyrophora species ([[Armenian cochineal|Armenian]] and [[Polish cochineal]]). Cochineal dye, the so-called "laq" was formerly exported from India, and later on from Mexico and the Canary Islands. Insect dyes were more frequently used in areas where [[Rubia tinctorum|Madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] was not grown, like west and north-west Persia.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

==== Synthetic dyes ====
With modern synthetic [[dyes]], nearly every colour and shade can be obtained so that without chemical analysis it is nearly impossible to identify, in a finished carpet, whether natural or artificial dyes were used. Modern carpets can be woven with carefully selected synthetic colours, and provide artistic and utilitarian value.&lt;ref name="Eilland, 2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eilland|first1=Emmett|title=Oriental Rugs Today|date=2003|publisher=Berkeley Hills Books, Albany, CA|isbn=1-893163-46-6|pages=50–59|edition=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Abrash ====
The appearance of slight deviations within the same colour is called abrash (from Turkish ''abraş'', literally, “speckled, piebald”). Abrash is seen in traditionally dyed oriental rugs. Its occurrence suggests that a single weaver has likely woven the carpet, who did not have enough time or resources to prepare a sufficient quantity of dyed yarn to complete the rug. Only small batches of wool were dyed from time to time. When one string of wool was used up, the weaver continued with the newly dyed batch. Because the exact hue of colour is rarely met again when a new batch is dyed, the colour of the pile changes when a new row of knots is woven in. As such, the colour variation suggests a village or tribal woven rug, and is appreciated as a sign of quality and authenticity. Abrash can also be introduced on purpose into a newly planned carpet design.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Bannon|first1=George|title=Oriental rugs : the collector's guide to selecting, identifying, and enjoying new and vintage oriental rugs|date=1995|publisher=Courage Press|location=Pennsylvania, Pa.|isbn=9781561385287|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques and structures==
{{see also|Oriental rug # manufacture}}

=== The process of weaving a rug ===
The weaving of pile rugs is a time-consuming process which, depending on the quality and size of the rug, may take anywhere from a few months to several years to complete.

To begin making a rug, one needs a foundation consisting of warps and wefts: [[Warp (weaving)|Warps]] are strong, thick threads of cotton, wool or silk which run through the length of the rug. Similar threads which pass under and over the warps from one side to the other are called [[Warp and woof|wefts]]. The warps on either side of the rug are normally plied into one or more strings of varying thickness that are overcast to form the selvedge.

Weaving normally begins from the bottom of the loom, by passing a number of wefts through the warps to form a base to start from. Knots of dyed wool, cotton or silk threads are then tied in rows around consecutive sets of adjacent warps. As more rows are tied to the foundation, these knots become the pile of the rug. Between each row of knots, one or more shots of weft are passed to keep the knots fixed. The wefts are then beaten down by a comb-like instrument, the comb beater, to further compact and secure the newly-woven row. Depending on the fineness of the weave, the quality of the materials and the expertise of the weavers, the [[knot count]] of a handmade rug can vary anywhere from 16 to 800 knots per square inch.

When the rug is completed, the warp ends form the fringes that may be weft-faced, braided, tasseled, or secured in other ways.

===Looms===
Looms do not vary greatly in essential details, but they do vary in size and sophistication. The main technical requirement of the loom is to provide the correct tension and the means of dividing the warps into alternate sets of leaves. A shedding device allows the weaver to pass wefts through crossed and uncrossed warps, instead of laboriously threading the weft in and out of the warps.

===Horizontal looms===
The simplest form of loom is a horizontal; one that can be staked to the ground or supported by sidepieces on the ground. The necessary tension can be obtained through the use of wedges. This style of loom is ideal for nomadic people as it can be assembled or dismantled and is easily transportable. Rugs produced on horizontal looms are generally fairly small and the weave quality is inferior to those rugs made on a professional standing loom.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

===Vertical looms===
The technically more advanced, stationary vertical looms are used in villages and town manufactures. The more advanced types of vertical looms are more comfortable, as they allow for the weavers to retain their position throughout the entire weaving process. The Tabriz type of vertical loom allows for weaving of carpets up to double the length of the loom, while there is no limit to the length of the carpet that can be woven on a vertical roller beam loom. In essence, the width of the carpet is limited by the length of the loom beams.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

There are three general types of vertical looms, all of which can be modified in a number of ways: the fixed village loom, the [[Tabriz]] or Bunyan loom, and the roller beam loom.

# The fixed village loom is used mainly in [[Iran]] and consists of a fixed upper beam and a moveable lower or cloth beam which slots into two sidepieces. The correct tension of the warps is obtained by driving wedges into the slots. The weavers work on an adjustable plank which is raised as the work progresses.
# The Tabriz loom, named after the city of [[Tabriz]], is used in Northwestern Iran. The warps are continuous and pass around behind the loom. Warp tension is obtained with wedges. The weavers sit on a fixed seat and when a portion of the carpet has been completed, the tension is released and the carpet is pulled down and rolled around the back of the loom. This process continues until the rug is completed, when the warps are severed and the carpet is taken off the loom.
# The roller beam loom is used in larger Turkish manufactures, but is also found in Persia and India. It consists of two movable beams to which the warps are attached. Both beams are fitted with ratchets or similar locking devices. Once a section of the carpet is completed, is rolled on to the lower beam. On a roller beam loom, any length of carpet can be produced. In some areas of Turkey several rugs are woven in series on the same warps, and separated from each other by cutting the warps after the weaving is finished.

===Tools===
[[File:Carpet tools.jpg|thumb|Some traditional tools of the craft.]]

The weaver needs a number of essential tools: a knife for cutting the yarn as the knots are tied; a heavy comb-like instrument with a handle for packing down the wefts; and a pair of shears for trimming the pile after a row of knots, or a small number of rows, have been woven. In Tabriz the knife is combined with a hook to tie the knots, which speeds up work. A small steel comb is sometimes used to comb out the yarn after each row of knots is completed.

A variety of additional instruments are used for packing the weft. Some weaving areas in Iran known for producing very fine pieces use additional tools. In [[Kerman]], a saber like instrument is used horizontally inside the shed. In [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]], a nail-like tool is inserted between the warps, and beaten on in order to compact the fabric even more. Bijar is also famous for their wet loom technique, which consists of wetting the warp, weft, and yarn with water throughout the weaving process to compact the wool and allow for a particularly heavy compression of the pile, warps, and wefts. When the rug is complete and dried, the wool and cotton expand, which results in a very heavy and stiff texture. Bijar rugs are not easily pliable without damaging the fabric.

A number of different tools may be used to shear the wool depending on how the rug is trimmed as the weaving progresses or when the rug is complete. Often in Chinese rugs the yarn is trimmed after completion and the trimming is slanted where the color changes, giving an embossed three-dimensional effect.

===Knots===
{{main|Knotted-pile carpet}}
{{multiple image
 | width = 120
 | image1 = Noeud turc.jpg

}}

Persian carpets are mainly woven with two different knots: The symmetrical [[Ghiordes knot|Turkish]] or "Giordes" knot, also used in Turkey, the Caucasus, East Turkmenistan, and some Turkish and Kurdish areas of Iran, and the asymmetrical '''Persian''', or '''Senneh knot''', also used in India, Turkey, Pakistan, China, and Egypt. The term "Senneh knot" is somewhat misleading, as rugs are woven with symmetric knots in the town of Senneh.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

To tie a symmetric knot, the yarn is passed between two adjacent warps, brought back under one, wrapped around both forming a collar, then pulled through the center so that both ends emerge between the warps.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The asymmetric knot is tied by wrapping the yarn around only one warp, then the thread is passed behind the adjacent warp so that it divides the two ends of the yarn. The Persian knot may open on the left or the right.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

The asymmetric knot allows to produce more fluent, often curvilinear designs, while more bold, rectilinear designs may use the symmetric knot. As exemplified by Senneh rugs with their elaborate designs woven with symmetric knots, the quality of the design depends more on the weaver's skills, than on the type of knot which is used.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

Another knot frequently used in Persian carpets is the Jufti knot, which is tied around four warps instead of two.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; A serviceable carpet can be made with jufti knots, and jufti knots are sometimes used in large single-colour areas of a rug, for example in the field, to save on material. However, as carpets woven wholly or partly with the jufti knot need only half the amount of pile yarn compared to traditionally woven carpets, their pile is less resistant to wear, and these rugs do not last as long.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Flat-woven carpets===
Flat woven carpets are given their colour and pattern from the weft which is tightly intertwined with the warp. Rather than an actual pile, the foundation of these rugs gives them their design. The weft is woven between the warp until a new colour is needed, it is then looped back and knotted before a new colour is implemented.

The most popular of flat-weaves is called the Kilim. Kilim rugs (along with jewellery, clothing and animals) are important for the identity and wealth of nomadic tribes-people. In their traditional setting Kilims are used as floor and wall coverings, horse-saddles, storage bags, bedding and cushion covers.

Various forms of flat-weaves exist including:
*[[Herati rug|Herati]]
*[[Jajim rug|Jajim]]
*[[Gelim]] ([[Kilim]])
*[[Maleki rug|Maleki]]
*[[Sirjan rug|Sirjan]]
*[[Soumak rug|Soumak]] (Soumakh)
*[[Suzani rug|Suzani]]

* '''''Ghali''''' (Persian: {{lang|fa|قالی}}, lit. "carpet"): large format carpets (190 × 280&amp;nbsp;cm).
* '''''Dozar''''' or '''''Sedjadeh''''': The term comes from Persian ''do'', "two" and ''zar'', a Persian measure corresponding to about {{convert|105|cm|lk=out|abbr=off}}. Carpets of Dozar size are approximately {{convert|130|-|140|cm|abbr=on}} x {{convert|200|-|210|cm|abbr=on}}.
* '''''Ghalitcheh''''' (Persian: {{lang|fa|قالیچه}}): Carpet of Dozar format, but woven in very fine quality.
* '''''Kelleghi''''' or '''''Kelley''''' : A long format, ca. {{convert|150|-|200|cm|abbr=on}} x {{convert|300|-|600|cm|abbr=on}}. This format is traditionally placed at the head of a ''ghali'' carpet (''kalleh'' means "head" in Persian).
* '''''Kenareh''''' : Smaller long format: {{convert|80|-|120|cm|abbr=on}} × {{convert|250|-|600|cm|abbr=on}}. Traditionally laid out along the longer sides of a larger carpet (''kenār'' means "side" in Persian language).
* '''''Zaronim''''' : corresponds to 1 ½ ''zar''. These smaller rugs are about {{convert|150|cm|abbr=on}} long.

[[Nomad]]ic carpets are also known as '''''Gelim''''' ({{lang|fa|گلیم}}; including {{lang|fa|زیلو}} ''Zilu'', meaning "rough carpet".&lt;ref name="Savory, R."/&gt; In this use, Gelim includes both pile rugs and flat weaves (such as [[kilim]] and [[soumak rug|soumak]]).

=== Field design, medallions and borders ===
[[File:Toranj - special circular design of Iranian carpets.JPG|thumbnail|Toranj (medallion) - special circular design of Iranian carpets]]
Rug design can be described by the way the ornaments are arranged within the pile. One basic design may dominate the entire field, or the surface may be covered by a pattern of repeating figures.

In areas with traditional, time-honoured local designs, such as the Persian nomad tribes, the weaver is able to work from memory, as the specific patterns are part of the family or tribal tradition. This is usually sufficient for less elaborate, mostly rectilinear designs. For more elaborate, especially curvilinear designs, the patterns are carefully drawn to scale in the proper colours on graph paper. The resulting design plan is termed a "cartoon". The weaver weaves a knot for each square on the scale paper, which allows for an accurate rendition of even the most complex designs. Designs have changed little through centuries of weaving. Today computers are used in the production of scale drawings for the weavers.&lt;ref&gt;Oriental Rugs: A Complete Guide, by Murray L. Eiland Jr. &amp; Murray Eiland III, London 2008, page 66&lt;/ref&gt;

The surface of the rug is arranged and organized in typical ways, which in all their variety are nevertheless recognizable as Persian: One single, basic design may cover the entire field ('''"all-over design"'''). When the end of the field is reached, patterns may be cut off intentionally, thus creating the impression that they continue beyond the borders of the rug. This feature is characteristic for Islamic design: In the Islamic tradition, depicting animals or humans is [[Aniconism in Islam|prohibited]] even in a profane context, as Islam does not distinguish between religious and profane life. Since the codification of the [[Quran]] by [[Uthman|Uthman Ibn Affan]] in 651 AD/19 AH and the [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] [[Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan]] reforms, [[Islamic art]] has focused on writing and ornament. The main fields of Persian rugs are frequently filled with redundant, interwoven ornaments, often in form of elaborate spirals and tendrils in a manner called '''infinite repeat'''.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, 1943"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Zum Orientteppich|journal=Asienberichte|date=1943|volume=5|issue=19|page=20|location=Vienna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design elements may also be arranged more elaborately. One typical oriental rug design uses a '''medallion''', a symmetrical pattern occupying the center of the field. Parts of the medallion, or similar, corresponding designs, are repeated at the four '''corners''' of the field. The common Persian "Lechek Torūnj" (medaillon and corner) design was developed in Persia for book covers and ornamental [[Persian miniature|book illuminations]] in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, it was integrated into carpet designs. More than one medallion may be used, and these may be arranged at intervals over the field in different sizes and shapes. The field of a rug may also be broken up into different rectangular, square, diamond or lozenge shaped compartments, which in turn can be arranged in rows, or diagonally.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

In contrast to Anatolian rugs, the Persian carpet medaillon represents the primary pattern, and the infinite repeat of the field appears subordinate, creating an impression of the medaillon "floating" on the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Der Orientalische Knüpfteppich. tr. C. G. Ellis as Oriental Carpets: An Essay on Their History, New York, 1960.|date=1965|publisher=Verlag Ernst Wasmuth|location=Tübingen|pages=47–51|edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most Persian rugs, the field of the rug is surrounded by stripes, or borders. These may number from one up to over ten, but usually there is one wider '''main border''' surrounded by minor, or '''guardian borders'''. The main border is often filled with complex and elaborate rectilinear or curvilinear designs. The minor border stripes show simpler designs like meandering vines. The traditional Persian border arrangement was highly conserved through time, but can also be modified to the effect that the field encroaches on the main border. This feature is often seen in Kerman rugs from the late nineteenth century, and was likely taken over from French [[Aubusson tapestry|Aubusson]] or [[Savonnerie]] weaving designs.

The corner articulations are a particularly challenging part of rug design. The ornaments have to be woven in a way that the pattern continues without interruption around the corners between horizontal and vertical borders. This requires advance planning either by a skilled weaver who is able to plan the design from start, or by a designer who composes a cartoon before the weaving begins. If the ornaments articulate correctly around the corners, the corners are termed to be "resolved", or "reconciled". In village or nomadic rugs, which are usually woven without a detailed advance plan, the corners of the borders are often not resolved. The weaver then discontinues the pattern at a certain stage, e.g., when the lower horizontal border is finished, and starts anew with the vertical borders. The analysis of the corner resolution helps distinguishing rural village, or nomadic, from workshop rugs.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Smaller and composite design elements ===
The field, or sections of it, can also be covered with smaller design elements. The overall impression may be homogeneous, although the design of the elements themselves can be highly complicated. Amongst the repeating figures, the [[Paisley (design)|'''boteh''']] is used throughout the "carpet belt". Boteh can be depicted in curvilinear or rectilinear style. The most elaborate boteh are found in rugs woven around [[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]. Rugs from [[Seraband rug|Seraband]], Hamadan, and Fars sometimes show the boteh in an all-over pattern. Other design elements include ancient motifs like the [[Tree of life]], or floral and geometric elements like, e.g., stars or palmettes.

Single design elements can also be arranged in groups, forming a more complex pattern:&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;
* The '''Herati''' pattern consists of a lozenge with floral figure at the corners surrounded by lancet-shaped leaves sometimes called "fish".  Herati patterns are used throughout the "carpet belt"; typically, they are found in the fields of [[Bidjar rug]]s. 
* The '''Mina Khani''' pattern is made up of flowers arranged in a rows, interlinked by diamond (often curved) or circular lines. frequently all over the field. The Mina Khani design is often seen on [[Varamin Carpet|Varamin rugs]].
* The '''Shah Abbasi''' design is composed of a group of palmettes. Shah Abbasi motifs are frequently seen in [[Kashan rug|Kashan]], [[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]], [[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]] and [[Nain rug|Nain]] rugs.
* The '''Bid Majnūn''', or Weeping Willow design is in fact a combination of weeping willow, cypress, poplar and fruit trees in rectilinear form. Its origin was attributed to Kurdish tribes, as the earliest known examples are from the Bidjar area.
* The '''Harshang''' or Crab design takes its name from its principal motive, which is a large oval motive suggesting a crab. The pattern is found all over the rug belt, but bear some resemblance to palmettes from the Safavid period, and the "claws" of the crab may be conventionalized arabesques in rectilinear style.
* The '''Gol Henai''' small repeating pattern is named after the Henna plant, which it does not much resemble. The plant looks more like the Garden balsam, and in the Western literature is sometimes compared to the blossom of the Horse chestnut.

== Classification ==
Persian carpets are best classified by the social context of their weavers. Carpets were produced simultaneously by nomadic tribes, in villages, town and court manufactures, for home use, local sale, or export.
{{clear}}

=== Nomadic/tribal carpets ===
Nomadic, or tribal carpets are produced by different ethnic groups with distinct histories and traditions. As the nomadic tribes originally wove carpets mainly for their own use, their designs have maintained much of the tribal traditions. However, during the twentieth century, the nomadic lifestyle was changed to a more sedentary way either voluntarily, or by the forced settlement policy of the last Persian emperors of the [[Pahlavi dynasty]]. By 1970, it was observed that traditional weaving had almost ceased among major nomadic tribes,&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal rugs - Nomadic and Village Weavings from the Near East and Central Asia|date=1992|publisher=Laurence King Publishing|isbn=1-85669-025-3|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Opie|first1=James|title=Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia|date=1981|publisher=James Opie Oriental Rugs Inc.|location=Portland, Oregon|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in recent years, the tradition has been revived.&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt;

==== Kurds ====
The [[Kurds]] are an [[ethnic group]], mostly inhabiting the area spanning adjacent parts of southeastern ([[Turkish Kurdistan|Turkey]]), western ([[Iranian Kurdistan|Iran]]), northern ([[Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraq]]), and northern ([[Rojava|Syria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bengio|first1=Ofra|title=Kurdish awakening: Nation building in a fragmented homeland|date=2014|publisher=Univ of Texas Press|location=[S.l.]|isbn=978-0292758131}}&lt;/ref&gt; The large population and the wide geographical distribution of the Kurds account for a varied production spanning a spectre from coarse and naïve nomadic weavings to the most elaborate town manufacture carpets, finely woven like Senneh, or heavy fabrics like [[Bidjar rug|Bijar]] carpets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Eagleton|first1=William|title=An introduction to Kurdish rugs and other weavings|date=1988|publisher=Interlink Books|location=New York|isbn=978-0940793170|edition=1st American}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kurdish rugs represent a traditional part of Persian rug production, they merit separate consideration.

===== Senneh carpets =====
[[File:Senneh.jpg|thumb|1Senneh rug]]

The city of [[Sanandij]], formerly known as Senneh, is the capital of [[Kurdistan Province|Persian Kurdistan]]. The rugs produced here are still known, also in the Iran of today, under their trade name "Senneh". They belong to the most finely woven Persian rugs, with knot counts up to 400 per square inch (6200/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The pile is closely clipped, and the foundation is cotton, also silk was used in antique carpets. Some fine carpets have silk warps dyed in different colours which create fringes in different colours known as "rainbow warps" in the rug trade. Mostly blue colours are used in the field, or a pale red. The predominant pattern used to be the Herati pattern, with a lozenge-shaped central medallion also filled with repeating Herati patterns on a different background colour. More realistic floral patterns are also seen, probably in rugs woven for export to Europe.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

===== Bijar carpets =====
[[File:Fine Bidjar rug.jpg|thumb|Bidjar rug]]

The town of [[Bijar (city)|Bijar]] lies around {{convert|80|km|abbr=off}} northeast of Sanadij. Together, these two towns and their surrounding areas have been major centers of rug production since the eighteenth century. Carpets woven in Bijar and the surrounding villages show more varied designs than Senneh rugs, which has led to the distinction between "city" and "village" Bijar rugs. The Bijar rug is distinguished by its highly packed pile, which is produced by a special technique known as "wet weaving", with the help of a special tool. Warps, weft and pile are constantly kept wet during the weaving process. When the finished carpet is allowed to dry, the wool expands, and the fabric becomes more compact. The fabric is further compacted by vigorous hammering on nail-like metal devices which are inserted between the warps during the weaving. Alternate warps are moderately to deeply depressed. The fabric is further compacted by using wefts of different thickness. Usually one of three wefts is consideravly thicker than the others. The knots are symmetrical, at a density of 60 to over 200 per square inch (930–2100/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), rarely even over 400 (6200/&amp;nbsp;dm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The colours of Bijar rugs are exquisite, with light and dark blues, and saturated to light, pale madder red. The designs are traditionally Persian, with predominant Herati, but also Mina Khani, Harshang, and simple medallion forms. Frequently the design is more rectilinear, but Bijar rugs are more easily identified by their peculiar, stiff and heavy weaving than by any design. Bijar rugs cannot be folded without risking to damage the foundation. A specific feature is also the lack of outlining, particularly of the smaller patterns. Full-size "sampler" carpets showing only examples of field and border designs rather than a fully developed carpet design are called "vagireh" by rug traders, and are frequently seen in the Bijar area. New Bijar carpets are still exported from the area, mostly with less elaborate Herati designs and dyed with good synthetic dyes.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

===== Kurdish village rugs =====
From a Western perspective, there is not much detailed information about Kurdish village rugs, probably because there is insufficient information to identify them, as they have never been specifically collected in the West. Usually, rugs can only be identified as "northwest Persian, probably Kurdish".&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; As is generally the case with village and nomadic rugs, the foundation of village rugs is more predominantly of wool. Kurdish sheep wool is of high quality, and takes dyes well. Thus, a rug with the distinct features of "village production", made of high-quality wool with particularly fine colours may be attributed to Kurdish production, but mostly these attributions remain educated guesswork. Extensive use of common rug patterns and designs poses further difficulty in assigning a specific regional or tribal provenience. A tendency of integrating regional traditions of the surrounding areas, like Anatolian or northwestern Persian designs was observed, which sometimes show distinct, unusual design variations leading to suggest a Kurdish production from within the adjacent areas. Also, northwestern Persian towns like Hamadan, Zenjan or Sauj Bulagh may have used "Kurdish" design features in the past, but modern production on display at the Grand Persian Exhibitions seems to focus on different designs.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Qashqai ====
[[File:Ghashghai rug.jpg|thumb|Qashqai rug]]
[[File:Qashqai tas front.jpg|thumb|Qashqai bag front]]
[[File:Abrash.JPG|thumb|Central medallion of a Qashqai rug, 19th century, with fragmented Herati pattern]]
{{see also|Shiraz rug}}

The early history of the [[Qashqai people]] remains obscure. They speak a Turkic dialect similar to that of Azerbaijan, and may have migrated to the Fars province from the north during the thirteenth century, possibly driven by the Mongol invasion. [[Karim Khan]] Zand appointed the chief of the Chahilu clan as the first Il-Khan of the Qashqai.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; The most important subtribes are the Qashguli, Shishbuluki, Darashuri, Farsimadan, and Amaleh. The Gallanzan, Rahimi, and Ikdir produce rugs of intermediate quality. The rugs woven by the Safi Khani and Bulli subtribes are considered among the highest quality rugs.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt; The rugs are all wool, usually with ivory warps, which distinguishes Qashqai from Khamseh rugs. Qashqai rugs use asymmetric knots, while Gabbeh rugs woven by Qashqai more often use symmetric knots. Alternate warps are deeply depressed. Wefts are in natural colours or dyed red. The selvedges are overcast in wool of different colours, creating a "barber pole" pattern, and are sometimes adorned with woolen tassels. Both ends of the rug have narrow, striped flat-woven kilims. Workshops were established in the nineteenth century already around the town of [[Firuzabad, Fars|Firuzabad]]. Rugs with repeating boteh and the Herati pattern, medallion, as well as prayer rug designs resembling the millefleurs patterns of Indian rugs were woven in these manufactures. The Herati design may sometimes appear to be disjointed and fragmented. The Qashqai are also known for their flatweaves, and for their production of smaller, pile-woven saddle bags, flat-woven larger bags (''mafrash''), and their [[Gabbeh]] rugs.

The '''Shishbuluki''' (''lit.'': "six districts") rugs are distinguished by small, central, lozenge-shaped medallions surrounded by small figures aligned in concentric lozenges radiating from the center. The field is most often red, details are often woven in yellow or ivory. '''Darashuri''' rugs are similar to those of the Shishbuluki, but not so finely woven.&lt;ref name="Parham 1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parham|first1=Cyrus|title=Masterpieces of Fars Rugs|date=1996|publisher=Soroush Press|location=Tehran}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the truly nomadic way of life has virtually come to an end during the twentieth century, most Qashqai rugs are now woven in villages, using vertical looms, cotton warps, or even an all-cotton foundation. They use a variety of designs associated with the Qashqai tradition, but it is rarely possible to attribute a specific rug to a specific tribal tradition. Many patterns, including the "Qashqai medallion" previously thought to represent genuine nomadic design traditions, have been shown to be of town manufacture origin, and were integrated into the rural village traditions by a process of stylization.&lt;ref name="Ford, Oriental Carpet Design"/&gt;

The revival of natural dyeing has had a major impact on Qashqai rug production. Initiated in [[Shiraz]] during the 1990s by master dyers as Abbas Sayahi,&lt;ref name="Opie, Vegetal dyes, Iran"/&gt; particularly [[Gabbeh]] rugs raised much interest when they were first presented at the Great Persian Exhibition in 1992. Initially woven for home use and local trade, coarsely knotted with symmetric knots, the colours initially seen were mostly natural shades of wool. With the revival of natural colours, Gabbeh from [[Fars province]] soon were produced in a full range of colours. They met the Western demand for primitive, naïve folk art as opposed to elaborate commercialized designs, and gained high popularity. In the commercial production of today, the Gabbeh rug patterns remain simple, but tend to show more modern types of design.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt;

==== Khamseh federation ====
{{see also|Shiraz rug}}
[[File:persian rug.jpg|thumb|A rug by [[Basseri|Basseri tribe]]]]

The [[Khamseh]] (''lit.'': "five tribes") federation was established by the Persian [[Qajar dynasty|Qajar]] government in the nineteenth century, to rival the dominant Qashqai power. Five tribal groups of Arab, Persian and Turkic origin were combined, including the Arab tribe, the [[Basseri]], Baharlu, Ainalu, and Nafar tribes.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt; It is difficult to attribute a specific rug to the Khamseh production, and the label "Khamseh" is often used as a term of convenience. Dark woolen warps and borders are associated with '''Arab''' Khamseh rugs, warps are rarely depressed, the colour scheme is more subdued. Specifically, a stylized bird (''"murgh"'') pattern is often seen on rugs attributed to the confederation, arranged around a succession of small, lozenge shaped medallions. '''[[Basseri]]''' rugs are asymmetrically knotted, brighter in colours, with more open space and smaller ornaments and figure with Orange as the specific color.&lt;ref name="Eilland &amp; Eilland Complete Guide 1998"/&gt; The '''Baharlu''' are a Turkic-speaking tribe settled around [[Darab]], and few carpets are known from this more agricultural region.

==== Luri ====
The [[Lurs]] live mainly in western and south-western Iran. They are of Indo-European origin. Their [[Luri language|dialect]] is closely related to the [[Bakhtiari dialect]] and to the dialect of the southern [[Kurds]]. Their rugs have been marketed in [[Shiraz]]. The rugs have a dark wool foundation, with two wefts after each row of knots. Knots are symmetrical or asymmetrical. Small compartment designs of repeating stars are often seen, or lozenge-shaped medallions with anchor-like hooks on both ends.&lt;ref name="Opie, Tribal Rugs of Southern Persia"/&gt;

==== Afshari ====
{{see also|Afshar rugs}}

The [[Afshar people]] are a semi-nomadic group of Turkic origin, principally located in the mountainous areas surrounding the modern city of [[Kirman]] in southeastern Iran. They produce mainly rugs in runner formats, and bags and other household items with rectilinear or curvilinear designs, showing both central medallions and allover patterns. Colours are bright and pale red. The flat-woven ends often show multiple narrow stripes.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Beluch ====
{{see also|Baluch rug}}
The [[Beluch]] people live in eastern Iran. They weave small-format rugs and a variety of bags with dark red and blue colours, often combined with dark brown and white. Camel hair is also used.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

=== Village carpets ===
Carpets produced in villages are usually brought to a regional market center, and carry the name of the market center as a label. Sometimes, as in the case of the "Serapi" rug, the name of the village serves as a label for a special quality. Village carpets can be identified by their less elaborate, more highly stylized designs.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

Criteria suggesting village production include:&lt;ref name="Wilber, 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wilber|first1=Donald N.|title=An introduction to Persian village rugs|journal=Oriental Rug Review|date=1989|volume=9|issue=6|pages=6–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A rug of so-called scatter-size (''dozar'') that has been woven in a settled environment;
# woven without a cartoon;
# woven without reconciled corners;
# woven with possible idiosyncrasies of construction and pattern elements.

Village rugs are more apt to have warps of wool rather than of cotton. Their designs are not as elaborate and ornate than the curvilinear patterns of city rugs. They are more likely to display abrash and conspicuous mistakes in detail. On simple vertical looms, the correct tension of the warps is difficult to maintain during the entire weaving process. So, village rugs tend to vary in width from end to end, have irregular sides, and may not lay entirely flat. In contrast to manufactory rugs, there is considerable variety in treating the selvedges and fringes. Village rugs are less likely to present depressed warps, as compared to manufactory rugs. They tend to make less use of flat woven kilim ends to finish off the ends of the rug, as compared to tribal rugs. The variation in treatment of fringes and ends, and the way the selvedges are treated, provide clues as to place of origin.&lt;ref name="Wilber, 1989"/&gt;

==== Northwestern Iran ====
{{main|Azerbaijani carpet|Ardabil rugs|Caucasian carpets and rugs}}
[[Tabriz]] is the market center for the Iranian Northwest. Carpets woven in this region mainly use the symmetric knot. [[Heriz]] is a local center of production for mainly room-size carpets. Warps and weft are of cotton, the weaving is rather coarse, with high-quality wool. Prominent central medaillons are frequently seen with rectilinear outlines highlighted in white. The ornaments of the field are in bold, rectilinear style, sometimes in an allover design. Higher quality Heriz carpets are known as Serapi. The village of [[Sarab, East Azerbaijan|Sarab]] produces runners and galleries with broad main borders either of camel hair or wool dyed in the colour of camel hair. Large, interconnected medaillons fill the field. Mostly rectilinear, geometric and floral patterns are dyed in pink red and blue. [[Bakshaish rugs and carpets|Bakshaish carpets]] with a shield-shaped large medaillon, less elaborate rectilinear patterns in salmon red and blue are labeled after the village of [[Bakhshayesh]]. Karadja produces runners with specific square and octagonal medaillons in succession.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Western Iran ====
Major production centers in the West are [[Hamadan]], [[Sarrak, Iran|Saruk]] with its neighbouring town of [[Arak, Iran|Arak]], [[Minudasht, Markazi|Minudasht]] also known under the trade name [[Lilihan carpets and rugs|Lilihan]] and Serabend, Maslaghan, [[Malayer]] and Feraghan.

* Carpets from '''Maslaghan''' are usually small (120 × 180&amp;nbsp;cm), the warps are made of cotton, the wefts of wool or cotton. The large medaillon shows a so-called "lobed [[Gul (design)|Göl]]", the colours of which are in sharp contrast to the field, with small borders. Malayer, Sarouk and Feraghan are located closely to each other. They use cotton for the foundation.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;
* '''Malayer''' carpets sre distinguished by their single-weft and the use of the symmetrical knot. Allover and medaillon patterns are common, the boteh motif is frequently used.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;
* The original '''Sarouk''' design was distinguished by a round-star medaillon with surrounding pendants. The traditional design of the Sarouk rug was modified by the weavers towards an allover design of detached floral motives, the carpets were then chemically washed to remove the unwanted colours, and the pile was painted over again with more desirable colours.&lt;ref name="Edwards, 1952"/&gt; '''Feraghan''' carpets are less finely woven thsn Sarouk. Often the Herati pattern is seen all over. Medaillons, if they occur, show more geometrical designs. A corroding green dye is typical for Feraghan carpets.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Southern Iran ====
Since the mid-twentieth century, commercial production started in the villages of [[Abade]]h and Yalameh. [[Abadeh rug]]s adopted traditional [[Qashqai people|Qashqai]] designs, but used cotton for warps and wefts, the latter often dyed in blue. [[Yalameh rug|Yalameh]] carpets more resemble [[Khamseh]] designs with hooked medaillons arranged in the field. Warps and wefts were often in white.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

==== Eastern Iran ====
The village of Doroksh is known for its carpet production in Eastern Persia. They are characterized by their use of orange dyes, the boteh motif is often seen. Usually, there is only one border. The knots are asymmetric.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

=== Town carpets ===
[[File:Following the Pattern, Weaver, Esfahan, Iran (14451927066).jpg|thumb|Weaving a carpet from a cartoon, Esfahan, Iran]]

[[Tabriz]] in the West, [[Kerman]] in the South, and [[Mashhad]] in the Northeast of Iran, together with the central Iranian towns of [[Kashan]], [[Isfahan]], [[Nain, Iran|Nain]] and [[Qom]] are the main centers of town manufacture.&lt;ref name="O'Bannon 1995"/&gt;

* '''[[Tabriz rug|Tabriz]]''' has been a center of carpet production for centuries. All kinds of designs are reproduced by Tabrizi weavers, with wool or silk in the pile, and wool, cotton or silk in the foundation.
* '''[[Kerman carpet|Kerman]]''' is known for finely knotted, elegant carpets with prominent cochineal red, ivory and golden yellow colours. Their medaillons are elegantly designed, and elaborate versions of the boteh design are often seen in the field. 
* '''[[Mashhad rug|Mashhad]]''' carpets are of average quality. Cochineal red is often used. Emogli carpets are made of silk, and represent the finest carpets manufactured in Mashhad. They show dense arabesque patterns on red ground.
* '''[[Kashan rug|Kashan]]''' is the oldest carpet-producing city in Central Iran. Famous for its production of silk carpets, carpet weaving was revived in the late 19th century. The earliest carpets woven in Kashan at the turn of the nineteenth century show some imbalances in their designs, which was overcome, and carpets were produced mainly with a red or ivory field and elaborate ogival central medallions.
* '''[[Isfahan rug|Isfahan]]''', '''[[Nain rug|Nain]]''', and '''[[Qom rug|Qom]]''' revived or started carpet manufacture by the mid-twentieth century. All-silk, or silk pile on cotton foundation carpets are produced with asymmetrical knots. Their design is often inspired by [[Safavid art|Safavid]] designs. Carpets from Qom and Nain often have richly decorated medaillons, and tender light blue and ivory colours. Isfahan carpets use more dark red and blue colours. They count among the finest Persian carpets today with some of them having a knot density of over one million knots per square meter. Some of the master weavers from these cities gained a worldwide reputation like Jamshidi from Qom or Habibian from Nain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.carpet-wiki.com/persian-master-knotters|title=The most popular Persian master knotters|last=Trading|first=Nain|website=www.carpet-wiki.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Commercial aspects ==
[[File:An Iranian Persian carpet exhibition.jpg|thumb|An Iranian/Persian carpet exhibition in city of [[Hamadan]] in 2015.]]
Iran exported $517 million worth of hand woven carpets in 2002. Iran's carpet exports amounted to US$635 million in 2004{{update after|2012|8}}, according to the figures from the state-owned Iran Carpet Company. In October 2006, National Iranian Carpet Center revealed that hand-woven carpets have ranked first in country's non-oil exports and hold the third position among overall exports. Nearly five million workers are engaged in the Iranian carpet industry, making it one of the biggest enterprises in the country.

In recent times Iranian carpets have come under fierce competition from other countries producing fakes of the original Persian designs as well as genuine cheaper substitutes. Most of the problems facing this traditional art is due to absence of patenting and branding the products as well as reduced quality of raw materials in the local market and the consistent loss of original design patterns. The absence of modern [[R&amp;D]] is causing rapid decline in the size as well as market value of this art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/persian/business/story/2007/07/070701_ka-carpet-iranian.shtml BBCPersian.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

United States is the single largest importer of Persian hand woven carpets. In 2011, President Obama signed into law an act that greatly enhanced restrictions on Iranian-origin imports, causing the imports of Iranian carpets to be frozen. In January 2016, the sanctions had been lifted and in the first quarter Iran's exports of carpets had amounted to $60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carpetsymphony.com/blogs/rug-academy/persian-rugs-the-silent-war-on-decoration|author=Tajvidi K.|publisher=Rug Academy|title=Persian Rugs &amp; The Silent War On Decoration|date=5 June 2014|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The country produces about five million square metres of carpets annually—79 percent of which are sold in international markets.&lt;ref name="presstv.com"&gt;[http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=138668&amp;sectionid=351020102 Presstv.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826114740/http://presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=138668&amp;sectionid=351020102 |date=2010-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times Iranian carpets have come under fierce competition from other countries producing reproductions of the original Iranian designs as well as cheaper substitutes.&lt;ref name="presstv.com"/&gt;

'''Politics of the International Space Station'''  begins with the 1972 milestone in co-operation between the United States and the Soviet Union in space, the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]]. This cooperative venture resulted in the July 1975 docking of [[Soyuz 19]] with an [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Apollo]] spacecraft. From 1978 to 1987, the USSR's [[Interkosmos]] programme included allied Warsaw Pact countries, and countries which were not Soviet allies, such as India, Syria and France, in manned and unmanned missions to Space stations Salyut 6 and 7. In 1986 the USSR extended this co-operation to a dozen countries in the [[Mir]] programme. From 1994 to 1998, NASA Space Shuttles and crew visited MIR in the [[Shuttle–Mir Program]]me. In 1998, assembly of the [[International Space Station]] began.&lt;ref name="OnOrbit"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |title=On-Orbit Elements |publisher=NASA |author=NASA |date=18 February 2010 |accessdate=19 June 2010 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091029013438/http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/ISSRG/pdfs/on_orbit.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, a meeting in Quebec City between the leaders of the Canadian Space Agency and those from Japan, Russia, the United States and involved European nations resulted in a renewed pledge to maintain the International Space Station until at least 2020. NASA reports to be still committed to the principles of the mission but also to use the station in new ways, which were not elaborated. CSA President Steve MacLean stated his belief that the station's Canadarm will continue to function properly until 2028, alluding to Canada's likely extension of its involvement beyond 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vancouversun.com/technology/Canada+renews+pledge+International+Space+Station+until+2020/6235789/story.html Canada renews pledge to International Space Station until 2020.] The Vancouver Sun. 1 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ownership of modules, station usage by participant nations, and responsibilities for station resupply are established by the Space Station Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA). This international treaty was signed on 28 January 1998 by the United States of America, Russia, Japan, Canada and eleven member states of the European Space Agency (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom).&lt;ref name="PartStates"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esa.int/esaHS/partstates.html|title=Human Spaceflight and Exploration—European Participating States|accessdate=17 January 2009|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|title=ISS Intergovernmental Agreement|publisher=European Space Agency (ESA)|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=19 April 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610083738/http://www.spaceflight.esa.int/users/index.cfm?act=default.page&amp;level=11&amp;page=1980|archivedate=10 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the United Kingdom, all of the signatories went on to contribute to the Space Station project. A second layer of agreements was then achieved, called Memoranda of Understanding (MOU), between NASA and ESA, CSA, RKA and JAXA. These agreements are then further split, such as for the contractual obligations between nations, and trading of partners' rights and obligations.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; Use of the Russian Orbital Segment is also negotiated at this level.&lt;ref name="RSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_rsa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Russian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these main intergovernmental agreements, Brazil originally joined the programme as a bilateral partner of the United States by a contract with NASA to supply hardware.&lt;ref name="Brazil"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Signs International Space Station Agreement With Brazil|url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/johnson/news/releases/1996_1998/h97-233.html|date=14 October 1997|accessdate=18 January 2009|publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to its ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor [[Embraer]] was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007.&lt;ref name="Emerson Kimura 2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Brazil O Brasil na Estação Espacial Internacional|url=http://www.gizmodo.com.br/conteudo/made-brazil-o-brasil-na-estacao-espacial-internacional/|publisher=Gizmodo Brazil|accessdate=9 March 2011|author=Emerson Kimura|language=Portuguese|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Italy has a similar contract with NASA to provide comparable services, although Italy also takes part in the programme directly via its membership in ESA.&lt;ref name="Italy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asi.it/en/flash_en/living/the_international_space_station_iss|title=International Space Station (ISS)|publisher=Italian Space Agency|date=18 January 2009|accessdate=18 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Expanding the partnership would require unanimous agreement of the existing partners.

The Russian part of the station is operated and controlled by the Russian Federation's space agency and provides Russia with the right to nearly one-half of the crew time for the ISS. The allocation of remaining crew time (three to four crew members of the total permanent crew of six) and hardware within the other sections of the station is as follows: ''[[Columbus (ISS module)|Columbus]]'': 51% for the ESA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt; ''[[Japanese Experiment Module|Kibō]]'': 51% for the JAXA, 46.7% for NASA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_japan.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Government of Japan Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=24 February 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Destiny (ISS module)|Destiny]]'': 97.7% for NASA and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/elements/nasa_csa.html|title=Memorandum of Understanding Between the National Aeronautics and Space Administration of the United States of America and the Canadian Space Agency Concerning Cooperation on the Civil International Space Station|publisher=NASA|accessdate=19 April 2009|date=29 January 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Crew time, electrical power and rights to purchase supporting services (such as data upload and download and communications) are divided 76.6% for NASA, 12.8% for JAXA, 8.3% for ESA, and 2.3% for CSA.&lt;ref name="ESA-IGA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAXA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CSA-MOU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manifest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/structure/iss_manifest.html|title=Consolidated Launch Manifest|accessdate=8 July 2008|publisher=NASA|author=NASA|date=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SSSM"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Harland|title=The Story of Space Station Mir|publisher=Springer-Verlag New York Inc|date=30 November 2004|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-23011-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included in the agreement was training, provision of Soyuz capsules, life support systems, docking systems, and space suits. American observers comment that Shenzhou spacecraft could dock at the ISS if it became politically feasible, whilst Chinese engineers say work would still be required on the rendezvous system.

==Brazil==
Brazil joined the ISS as a partner of the United States and this included a contract with NASA to supply hardware to the Space Station.&lt;ref name="Brazil"/&gt; In return, NASA would provide Brazil with access to NASA ISS facilities on-orbit, as well as a flight opportunity for one Brazilian astronaut during the course of the ISS programme. However, due to cost issues, the subcontractor [[Embraer]] was unable to provide the promised ExPrESS pallet, and Brazil left the programme in 2007.&lt;ref name="Emerson Kimura 2009"/&gt; Regardless, the first Brazilian astronaut, [[Marcos Pontes]], was sent to ISS in April 2006 for [[Expedition 13]].&lt;ref name="space.com"&gt;[http://www.space.com/2222-brazils-astronaut-fresh-iss-crew-reach-orbit.html]&lt;/ref&gt; This was Brazil's first space traveler and he returned to Earth safely.&lt;ref name="space.com"/&gt; Pontes trained on the Space Shuttle and Soyuz, but ended up going up with the Russians, although he did work at the U.S. Johnson Space Center after returning to Earth.

'''Prajñāpāramitā of Java''' refer to a famous [[murti|depiction]] of [[Boddhisattva]]devi [[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]], originated from 13th century [[Singhasari kingdom|Singhasari]], [[East Java]], Indonesia.&lt;ref name="National Museum"&gt;{{cite web|title=Collectionː Prajnaparamita|publisher=National Museum of Indonesia|url=http://www.museumnasional.or.id/collections/arkeologi/prajnaparamita.html|accessdate=17 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20150109125052/http%3A//www.museumnasional.or.id/collections/arkeologi/prajnaparamita.html|archivedate=9 January 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statue is of great aesthetical and historical value, and is considered as the masterpiece of classical Hindu-[[Buddhist art]] of ancient Java.&lt;ref name ="VCM"&gt;{{cite web|title = Prajnaparamita | publisher =Virtual Collections of Asian Masterpieces| url  =http://masterpieces.asemus.museum/masterpiece/detail.nhn?objectId=12147| accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the statue is one of the prized collection of the [[National Museum of Indonesia]], [[Jakarta]].

==Description==
The statue of Prajnaparamita of East Java is probably the most famous depiction of the goddess of transcendental wisdom. The serene expression and meditative pose and gesture suggest peace and wisdom, in contrast with rich and intricate jewelry and decorations. The goddess is in a perfect lotus meditative position called ''vajrasana'' posture, sitting on a double lotus cushion called ''padmasana'' (lotus pedestal) on top of a square base.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; The statue sits before a carved stela.

The goddess performs ''dharmachakra-mudra'' (the [[mudra]] symbolizing turning the wheel of dharma).&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; Her left arm is placed around an ''utpala'' (blue lotus), on top of which sits her atrribute; the lontar palm leaf book [[Prajnaparamita Sutra]]. The head and face is perfectly chiseled, with downcast eyes and forehead ''urna''. The goddess wears her hair high arranged in ''Jatamakuta'' crown, and behind her head radiates ''prabhamandala'' a halo or aura of light to suggest a divinity that has reached the highest wisdom.&lt;ref name="Siva Buddha"&gt;{{cite book | title = Worshiping Siva and Buddha: The Temple Art of East Java |author1=Ann R. Kinney |author2=Marijke J. Klokke |author3=Lydia Kieven | publisher = University of Hawaii Press | year =2003 | url = https://books.google.co.id/books?id=sfa2FiIERLYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;vq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn =9780824827793 |accessdate =17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was discovered in almost perfect condition in the Cungkup Putri ruins near [[Singhasari temple]], [[Malang]], [[East Java]]. Local tradition links the statue to Queen [[Ken Dedes]] the first queen of Singhasari, probably as a deified portrayal of the queen.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt; Another opinion links the statue with Queen [[Gayatri Rajapatni]], the consort of [[Kertarajasa]] the first king of [[Majapahit]].&lt;ref name ="VCM"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author =Drake, Earl| year =2012 |title =Gayatri Rajapatni, Perempuan di Balik Kejayaan Majapahit|publisher = Ombak| location =Yogyakarta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Prajnaparamita is a goddess of high standing in Mahayana Tantric Buddhism; she is considered the [[shakti]], or consort, of the highest Buddha in the Buddhist pantheon known as [[Vajradhara]]; she symbolises perfect knowledge.&lt;ref name="National Museum"/&gt;

In the 13th century, the tantric Buddhism gained royal patronage of king [[Kertanegara]] of [[Singhasari]], and thereafter some of Prajnaparamita statues were produced in the region, such as the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari in East Java and Prajnaparamita of [[Muaro Jambi Regency|Jambi]], [[Sumatra]]. Both of East Java and Jambi Prajnaparamitas bear resemblance in style as they were produced in same period, however unfortunately Prajnaparamita of Jambi is headless and was discovered in poor condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Arca Prajnaparamitha | publisher = Balai Pelestaria Cagar Budaya Jambi |url = http://kebudayaan.kemdikbud.go.id/bpcbjambi/2014/08/20/arca-prajnaparamitha/| language = Indonesian |accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the Prajnaparamita of Singhasari was discovered in almost perfect condition. The pristine condition of the statue indicates that it was buried for quite some time. It was found near Candi E, the southernmost structure in the temple complex near [[Singhasari temple]]. The structure is called Candi Wayang or Cungkup Putri by local inhabitants.&lt;ref name="Siva Buddha"/&gt;

The Prajnaparamita of Java was discovered in 1818 or 1819 by D. Monnereau, a [[Dutch East Indies]] official. In 1820 Monnereau gave the statue to C.G.C. Reinwardt, who later brought the statue to the [[Netherlands]], where it became a prized possession of the [[Rijksmuseum voor Volkenkunde]] in [[Leiden]].&lt;ref name ="VCM"/&gt; For more than 158 years the statue was resided in Leiden, the Netherlands.

In January 1978, the Government of the Netherlands returned the statue to the Republic of Indonesia, when [[Queen Juliana of the Netherlands]] visited the former Dutch colony. Today, the statue is placed in [[National Museum of Indonesia]]. The statue is displayed on 2nd floor Gedung Arca, Indonesian National Museum, [[Jakarta]]. It has become perhaps the best known icon of ancient Indonesian art, as one of the rare images that successfully combines aesthetic perfection and spirituality.&lt;ref name ="egregores"&gt;{{cite web|title =Worshipping the Source: The Buddhist Goddess Prajnaparamita | publisher =egregores| url =https://egregores.wordpress.com/2009/09/25/worshipping-the-source-the-buddhist-goddess-prajnaparamita/|accessdate=17 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics''' ('''SINP''') is an institution of basic research and training in physical and biophysical sciences located in [[Salt Lake City (Bidhan Nagar), Kolkata|Bidhannagar]], [[Kolkata]], India. The institute is named after the famous Indian physicist [[Meghnad Saha]].

==History==
The Palit Research Laboratory used to be a laboratory under the Department of [[Physics]] in the [[University of Calcutta]]. Meghnad Saha became the Palit Professor of Physics at the University of Calcutta in 1938. Realizing the ensuing importance of  [[nuclear physics]], he reorganized the curriculum to include nuclear physics and commissioned some necessary instruments. Soon the necessity of a small-scale cyclotron was felt. Thanks to the help of [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and patronage of [[J. R. D. Tata|J.R.D.Tata]], the foundation stone of the Institute of Nuclear Physics was laid at Acharya Prafulla Chandra Road, Calcutta in 1949. The building was inaugurated in 1950 by [[Irène Joliot-Curie]]. The institute shifted to its new building in  [[Bidhannagar]] in the late 1980s.

==Administration==
SINP is an autonomous research institute under the administrative control of the Department of Atomic Energy, Government of India .The institute is governed by a governing council headed by the chairman of the atomic energy commission of India, in accordance with a tripartite agreement signed by the [[Government of India]], [[Government of West Bengal]] and the [[University of Calcutta]] in August 1992. The institute is known as a centre for conducting research for doctoral degrees and providing facilities for teaching and research in physical and biological sciences. The chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, India (and Secretary, DAE, government of India) chairs the governing council with members comprising three scientists nominated by the DAE, two representatives of the DAE, two nominees of CU, one nominee of Govt. of West Bengal and the Director of the Institute.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2477">:''See [[Sami shamanism]] for shamanism in northern Scandinavia, which is technically in Europe, but culturally part of the Finno-Ugric traditions of Northern Asia.''

The first historian to posit the existence of '''European [[Shamanism|shamanic]]''' ideas within [[popular religion|popular beliefs]] of otherwise [[Christianity in Europe|Christian Europeans]] was [[Carlo Ginzburg]], who examined the [[Benandanti]], an agrarian cult found in [[Friuli]], [[Italy]], whose members underwent shamanic trances in which they believed they battled  [[witchcraft|witches]] in order to save their crops.&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, Carlo (1983). ''The Night Battles: Witchcraft and Agrarian Cults in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ginzburg, Carlo (1991). ''Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath''. London: Penguin.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Historians following Ginzburg identified what they saw as shamanic elements in the accusations of the [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|Witch trials of the Early Modern period]]. These included [[Eva Pocs]]&lt;ref&gt;Pocs, Eva (1999). ''Between the Living and the Dead''. Budapest: Central European University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emma Wilby]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2005). ''Cunning Folk and Familiar Spirits: Shamanistic Visionary Traditions in Early Modern British Witchcraft and Magic''. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilby, Emma (2010). ''The Visions of Isabel Gowdie: Magic, Witchcraft and Dark Shamanism in Seventeenth-Century Scotland''. Brighton: Sussex Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This group of authors proposes what is known as the "[[Witch-cult hypothesis]]", arguing that there was a religious cult with continuity reaching into the pre-Christian period behind what became identified as "witchcraft" in the Early Modern period.

The idea of shamanism's existence in Ancient Greece was advanced by [[E. R. Dodds]]&lt;ref&gt;Eric R. Dodds (1951). ''The Greeks and the Irrational'', Berkeley, University of California Press, 1951.&lt;/ref&gt; and criticized by Michael J. Puett.&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Puett (2002). ''To Become a God: Cosmology, Sacrifice, and Self-divinization in Early China'', Cambridge, Harvard University Press, pp. 83-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}}
The '''''Institut für Staatskirchenrecht der Diözesen Deutschlands''''' ('''Institute for Church–State Relations of the Dioceses in Germany''') is a legal research institution of the Roman Catholic church based in [[Bonn]], Germany. It was founded in 1970 by the [[German Bishops' Conference]] and is now run by the Association of German Dioceses.

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1970 by the [[German Bishops' Conference]] under the auspices of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Essen]]. The founding director was the [[Jesuit]] [[Joseph List]], supported by Heiner and Karl Eugen Schlief Marré. Since 1975, it has been run by the Association of German Dioceses (German: ''Verband der Diözesen Deutschlands'', or VDD).

==Purpose==
The purpose of the Institute is the academic study of the public law on state–church relations in theory and practice. In addition to providing legal advice to church organizations and providing information on legal developments in the field of state–church relations, the Institute is tasked with observing the development of the relationship between state, religion and the [[Catholic Church|Church]].&lt;ref name="dbk"&gt;

The '''sustainable yield''' of [[natural capital]] is the [[ecological yield]] that can be extracted without reducing the base of capital itself, i.e. the [[Economic surplus|surplus]] required to maintain [[ecosystem services]] at the same or increasing level over time.  This yield usually varies over time with the needs of the [[ecosystem]] to maintain itself, e.g. a [[forest]] that has recently suffered a [[blight]] or [[flooding]] or [[fire]] will require more of its own ecological yield to sustain and re-establish a mature forest.  While doing so, the sustainable yield may be much less.

In forestry terms it is the largest amount of harvest activity that can occur without degrading the productivity of the stock.

[[File:Net fishing professionally 0544990019 KALFA.jpg|thumb| Fishery management utilizes the concept of sustainable yield to determine how much fish can be removed, so that the population remains sustainable.]]

This concept is important in fishery management, in which sustainable yield is defined as the number of fish that can be extracted without reducing the base of fish stock, and the [[maximum sustainable yield]] is defined as the amount of fish that can be extracted under given environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ricker|first=W.E.|date=1975|title=Computation and Interpretation of Biological Statistics of Fish Populations|journal=Bulletin of the Fisheries Research Board of Canada|volume=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fisheries, the basic natural capital or virgin population, must decrease with extraction. At the same time productivity increases. Hence, sustainable yield would be within the range in which the natural capital together with its production are able to provide satisfactory yield. It may be very difficult to quantify sustainable yield, because every dynamic ecological conditions and other factors  not  related to harvesting induce changes and fluctuations in both, the natural capital and its productivity.

In the case of [[groundwater]] there is a safe yield of water extraction per unit time, beyond which the [[aquifer]] risks the state of [[overdrafting]] or even depletion.

[[File:Mussolini Sword of Islam.jpg|thumb|The Sword of Islam]]
[[File:Mussolini spada islam.jpg|thumb|Mussolini with the Sword of Islam]]

The '''Sword of Islam''' ({{lang-ar|سيف الإسلام|Sayf al-Islām}}) was a ceremonial melee weapon given in 1937 to [[Benito Mussolini]], who was pronounced as the ''Protector of Islam'' ({{lang-ar|حامي الإسلام|Hāmī al-Islām}}).

==History==

In 1934, after the creation of [[Italian Libya]], Mussolini adopted a policy for encouraging comparisons with Islam, calling the local population "Italian Muslims of the fourth shore of Italy", building or restoring mosques and Koranic schools, preparing service facilities for the pilgrims going to [[Mecca]] and even making a High School of Islamic Culture in Tripoli. Behind the apparent humanitarian intent, [[fascists]] and some sectors of the Islamic world were recognizing [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] as common enemies and Mussolini wanted to exploit this to his advantage.&lt;ref name=rapporti&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arab.it/vari/fascismo.htm|title=I rapporti tra il fascismo e il mondo arabo-islamico|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Randazzo|2008|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; These common interests were generated from the aversion to the agreements of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] of 1919, dominated by the [[United States]], France, and the United Kingdom, which had neither fully satisfied the requests brought forth by Italy, nor the requests from this part of the Islamic world.&lt;ref name=rapporti/&gt; 

In order to earn the favor of the Arabs and to seal himself the alliance, Mussolini, although a signatory of the [[Lateran Treaty]] with the [[Holy See]], decided to have bestowed on him the title of ''Protector of Islam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ham|2007|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the interpretation of Mussolini, with the Italian government taking over the place of the [[Ottoman Libya|Ottomans in Libya]], such a title was up to him concerning law since, in some manner, he was heir of the authority of the caliph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lanna|Rossi|2003|p=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 1937, in the outskirts of [[Tripoli]], Mussolini received the Sword of Islam from Iusuf Kerisc, a leading Berber supporter of the Italian occupation against the Libyan resistance, during a lavish ceremony. After entering Tripoli among salutes of cannons and at the head of a rank of 2,600 cavalrymen, Mussolini reaffirmed his closeness to the Muslim population, guaranteeing "peace, justice, wellness and respect for the laws of the Prophet."&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediastudies.it/IMG/pdf/La_Spada_dell_Islam.pdf|title=La Spada dell'Islam|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of the approval from the media of the regime, the ceremony provoked hilarity among the Italian people because of its absurd and paradoxical connotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cifarelli|2004|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Antonini|1999|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the photographs of the event, depicting Mussolini on the saddle of a horse held by the halter by a [[Groom (profession)|groom]], in his official version was retouched and published deleting the groom, in order to make it appear that Mussolini was able to ride his own mount without anyone's help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediastudies.it/IMG/pdf/Propaganda_e_falsificazioni_fotografiche.pdf|title=Propaganda politica e falsificazioni fotografiche tra le due guerre mondiali|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detail is often cited as one of the more typical examples of the ''art of falsification'' established in the totalitarian regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/12_luglio_05/la-rimozione-leghista-bossi-pg-battista_69e21476-c661-11e1-8ab7-67e552429064.shtml|title=La rimozione leghista. Bossi, chi era costui?|access-date=November 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, a horse monument was inaugurated in the main square of the Libyan capital in honor of Mussolini. Its base read: "To Benito Mussolini, peacemaker of the people, redeemer of the land of Libya, the mindful population and exhibitions where the Sword of Islam flashed consecrate in the sign of the Lictor a loyalty that challenges the destiny."&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;

The sword, decorated in [[arabesque]], equipped with a double-edged straight blade and with a hilt and solid gold friezes, had been achieved from the art firm ''Picchiani e Barlacchi di Firenze'' on the order of Mussolini himself.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} After 1937, it was no longer used and was guarded in a small glass reliquary at Rocca delle Caminate, summer residence of Mussolini. There were no more signs of the precious object after [[Fall of the Fascist regime in Italy|July 25, 1943]], when Rocca delle Caminate was ravaged and plundered by anti-fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Romersa|1994|p=2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:India's Human Spaceflight Program - TMRO.webm|thumb|Michael Clark talks about India's human spaceflight program and the rockets that will enable them in a Space Pod.]]
'''''TMRO''''' (pronounced ''tomorrow'', formerly known as '''''Spacevidcast'''''), is a network of live and on-demand [[High-definition video|HD]] [[webcast]]s about technology, science, space, and human society. TMRO was established as Spacevidcast in 2008 by husband and wife team Benjamin and Cariann Higginbotham.

''TMRO''{{'s}} stated goal is {{cquote|''...to get the planet excited about living among the stars.''}}

In contrast to most space-related podcasts, ''TMRO'' is produced independently and is not associated with any governmental or private organization, which sets it apart from other shows like ''[[NASA Edge]]'' or ''Hubblecast''.&lt;ref name="strib20080630"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/22735284.html |title=Technobabble: Local webcast embarks on space odyssey |work=[[Star Tribune]] |first=Randy A. |last=Salas |date=June 30, 2008 |accessdate=July 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VXRTUgbL?url=http://www.startribune.com/lifestyle/22735284.html |archivedate=January 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://twincitieslive.com/article/day/S20080714.shtml?cat=181275&amp;articleID=181275 |title=Space Vidcast |work=Twin Cities Live |date=July 14, 2008 |accessdate=October 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the show hosts were hired by [[SpaceX]], however there is no tie between SpaceX and ''TMRO''.

In addition to traditional episodes, ''TMRO'' also offers some audio and text content as well as content provided through the crowdfunding platform [[Patreon]], including [[Google Hangouts]] and early access to ''TMRO After Dark''. There is also a ''TMRO'' [[Reddit#Subreddits|subreddit]] for viewers to discuss space and show topics. The program was awarded the Best Presentation of Space award during NewSpace 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title="Vision of the Future" and "Best Presentation of Space" Winners Announced |date=July 15, 2010 |url=http://spacefrontier.org/2010/07/15/visionfuture-presentation2010/ |accessdate=August 5, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VXRI7P5e?url=http://spacefrontier.org/2010/07/visionfuture-presentation2010/ |archivedate=January 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Show format==
The show is divided into an opener and three main segments. The first segment is Space News, discussing launches, technology, and spaceflight events that have occurred since the previous episode. Podcaster Michael Clark often talks about SpaceX news and provides input on other space topics. The second segment includes that episode's featured topic, which may be an interview or a discussion on a particular topic. During the third segment, viewer comments relating to the previous episode are read and discussed.

==TMRO Space==
TMRO Space was the original TMRO (and Spacevidcast) show before new shows were added.

==Live events and daily-casts==
''Spacevidcast'' has covered a number of live events such as [[Space shuttle program|Shuttle]] and [[Soyuz programme|Soyuz]] launches, the [[Mars Phoenix|Phoenix Mars]] landing, the launch of [[Jules Verne ATV]], the [[Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope|GLAST Space Telescope]], [[Chandrayaan-2|Chandrayaan-1]], [[Shenzhou 7]], the [[Kepler Mission]] as well as [[List of private spaceflight companies#Satellite launchers|commercial satellite]] launches. The website was one of many outlets to broadcast a live feed of the lunar impact by NASA's [[LCROSS]] spacecraft and participated in [[Guy Laliberté]]'s ''Poetic Social Mission Event: Moving Stars and Earth for Water''. These events are usually summed up in short daily clips dedicated to one or two events.

Additionally, ''Spacevidcast'' streamed [[NASA TV]] with an accompanying chat room through [[UStream]] live 24/7 with an [[HD video]] feed during launches and other significant events.

===2008 Lunar Lander Challenge===
The ''Spacevidcast'' team was the official event webcaster for the X Prize Foundation's [[Lunar Lander Challenge#2008|2008 Northrop Grumman Lunar Lander Challenge]]. ''Spacevidcast'' streamed continuously from Las Cruces, New Mexico on October 24 and 25. The hosts were on site to interview team leaders and VIP guests. The podcast was also the only media outlet to cover the "Rocket Racing League at [[Spaceport America]]" announcement by the governor of New Mexico, [[Bill Richardson]].

===ISDC 2009===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2009 [[International Space Development Conference]], an annual event hosted and organized by the [[National Space Society]]. As part of its coverage, the hosts provided live video webcasts of the main presentations as well as an option for viewers to send questions via the chat room. The videos were also made available on demand. In addition to direct coverage of the conference, ''Spacevidcast'' also broadcast a regular weekly show from the ISDC 2009 setting and the hosts participated in a panel discussion on May 29 entitled "Space Media 2.0".

===SpaceUp San Diego (2010)===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2010 [[SpaceUp]] San Diego unconference, the first major space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by the San Diego Space Society. As part of their coverage, the hosts provided live video webcasts of many of the presentations as well as much of the [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]] talks. The videos are now available on demand. The quality of these videos is low only because of a lack of internet connections at the conference and spotty cell phone coverage.

===NewSpace 2010 (2010)===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2010 [[Space Frontier Foundation]] NewSpace Conference, a yearly conference for NewSpace leaders to meet and organize the future of the [[NewSpace]] movement. Benjamin and Cariann provided live coverage of each of the talks during the weekend. The videos are now available on demand (some are Epic subscriber-only).

===SpaceUp D.C. (2010)===
''Spacevidcast'' was the exclusive webcaster of the 2010 [[SpaceUp]] Washington D.C. unconference, the second space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by Evadot founder Michael Doornbos. As part of their coverage, the hosts provided live video webcasts of many of the presentations and [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]] talks. The videos are now all available to watch on their [[YouTube]] channel.

===SpaceUp San Diego (2011)===
''Spacevidcast'' is the exclusive webcaster of the 2011 [[SpaceUp]] San Diego unconference, the third space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by the [[San Diego Space Society]] and the first repeat SpaceUp, held on February 12–13, 2011. Cariann Higginbotham, co-host of ''Spacevidcast'', is attending the event and, assisted by corporate and private sponsors, will be providing live video [[webcast]]s of many of the presentations and T-5 talks (similar to [[Ignite (event)|Ignite]] talks). The videos will be available to watch on their [[YouTube]] channel and will be viewable live on their website.

===SpaceUp Houston (2011)===
''Spacevidcast'' is the exclusive webcaster of the 2011 [[SpaceUp]] Houston unconference, the fourth space [[BarCamp]]-like event hosted by the Clear Lake NSS/Moon Society and the [[Lunar and Planetary Institute]] on February 12–13, 2011. Benjamin Higginbotham, co-host of ''Spacevidcast'', is attending the event and will be providing live video [[webcast]]s of many of the presentations and demonstrations. The videos will be available to watch on their [[YouTube]] channel and will be viewable live on their website.

===Space Shuttle launches===
''Spacevidcast'' was one of the first sources to get High Definition Space Shuttle launches online. These shows progressed until ''Spacevidcast'' was granted media access to the Kennedy Space Center Press site for STS-132 through the end of the program. The ''Spacevidcast'' shuttle coverage was marked as Wired Magazine's three best ways to watch a shuttle launch online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2011/02/space-shuttle-streams/ |title=3 Great Ways to Watch the Last Space Shuttle Missions |work=Wired |date=February 23, 2011 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6VXRd5zwC?url=http://www.wired.com/2011/02/space-shuttle-streams/ |archivedate=January 13, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''TMRO'' on Livestream===
During season 7, ''TMRO'' left YouTube streaming and moved to [[Livestream]] for more stable live streaming.

===''TMRO'' on Patreon===
During season 7, ''TMRO'' transitioned from its previous donor on-demand service, called Epic, to the crowdfunding website [[Patreon]].&lt;ref name="Patreon"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patreon.com/spacevidcast?ty=a |title=Spacevidcast is creating live webcasts about the cosmos |accessdate=March 1, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222140540/http://www.patreon.com/spacevidcast?ty=a |archivedate=February 22, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- MOVED below 06Jun07:  --&gt;

'''Tablature''' (or '''tabulature''', or '''tab''' for short) is a form of [[musical notation]] indicating instrument fingering rather than musical pitches.

Tablature is common for [[fret]]ted stringed instruments such as the [[lute]], [[vihuela]], or [[guitar]], as well as many [[free reed]] [[aerophone]]s such as the [[harmonica]].  Tablature was common during the Renaissance and Baroque eras, and is commonly used today in notating many forms of music.

Three types of [[organ tablature]] were used in Europe: German, Spanish and Italian.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=Music in the Western World , A History in Documents: Arts, Performing arts|title=Music in the Western World: A History in Documents, Study Guide. 2nd Edition.|last=|first=|date=2014 is given as the copyright date.|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=7/6/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To distinguish [[Modern musical symbols|standard musical notation]] from tablature, the former is usually called "[[Staff (music)|staff]] notation" or just "notation".

==Etymology==

The word ''tablature'' originates from the Latin word ''tabulatura''. ''Tabula'' is a table or slate, in Latin. To tabulate something means to put it into a table or chart.

==Origin==

The first known occurrence in Europe is around 1300, and was first used for notating music for the organ.{{Page needed|date=January 2010}}&lt;!-- Place, publisher, and the relevant page numbers needed. --&gt;

==Concepts==
While [[Modern musical symbols|standard notation]] represents the rhythm and duration of each note and its pitch relative to the scale based on a [[equal temperament|twelve tone division of the octave]], tablature is instead operationally based, indicating where and when a finger should be placed to generate a note, so pitch is denoted implicitly rather than explicitly. Tablature for plucked strings is based upon a diagrammatic representation of the strings and [[fret]]s of the instrument, keyboard tablature represents the keys of the instrument, and woodwind tablature shows whether each of the fingerholes is to be closed or left open.

==French lute tablature==
[[Image:Attaingnant--branle-de-poictou.png|thumb|300px|right|French Renaissance style lute tablature, with corresponding notation for guitar (with capo on third fret or tuned up a minor third): a simple Renaissance dance, printed by [[Pierre Attaingnant]].]]

Lowercase letters or "glyphs"are placed on each of these lines to represent notes. If it is required to play an open D course, for instance, a small ''a'' will be placed on the appropriate line. For a note with the finger on the first fret a ''b'', a note on the second fret a ''c'', etc. However, as mentioned above, ''j'' was not used since it was not considered a separate letter from ''i'', and ''c'' often looked more like ''r'' or the third letter of the Greek alphabet, Γ (gamma). Thus:

&lt;pre&gt;F_____c___
D_____a___
A_____b___
F_____c___
D_____a___
A_____b___
G - a&lt;/pre&gt;

would represent a G-minor chord (on a Renaissance lute in G-tuning),

All open strings would represent a D-minor chord:

&lt;pre&gt;F______a________
D______a________
A______a________
F______a________
D______a________
A______a________
D- ///a&lt;/pre&gt;

The strings below the sixth course are notated with additional short [[ledger line]]s: glyphs are placed below the staff. These courses are tuned in accordance with the key of each piece played:

&lt;pre&gt;G- a
F- /a
E- //a
D- ///a
C- 4
B- 5
A- 6&lt;/pre&gt;

==German lute tablature==
[[File:Tabulaturtypen.png|thumb|Types of lute tablatures]]
The origins of '''German lute tablature''' can be traced back well into the 15th century. Blind organist [[Conrad Paumann]] is said to have invented it.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Virdung, ''Musica getutscht'' (Basel 1511), and Martin Agricola, ''Musica instrumentalis deudsch'' (Wittenberg 1529), quoted in: Oswald Körte, ''Laute und Lautenmusik bis zur Mitte des 16. Jahrhunderts. Unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der deutschen Lautentabulatur'' (Publikationen der Internationalen Musikgesellschaft. Beihefte 3. Leipzig: Breitkopf und Härtel, 1901), 76 seq.&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in German-speaking countries until the end of the 16th century.

==Computer programs for writing tablatures==
See [[List of guitar tablature software]]

Various computer programs are available for writing tablature; some also write lyrics, guitar chord diagrams, chord symbols, and/or staff notation. [[ASCII tab]] files can be written (somewhat laboriously) with any ordinary word processor or text editor.

==Guitar tablature==

The following examples are labelled with letters on the left denoting the string names, with a lowercase ''e'' for the high E string. Tab lines may be numbered 1 through 6 instead, representing standard string numbering, where "1" is the high E string, "2" is the B string, etc.

The numbers that are written on the lines represent the fret used to obtain the desired pitch. For example, the number 3 written on the top line of the staff indicates that the player should press down at the third fret on the high E (first string). Number 0 denotes the [[Nut (string instrument)|nut]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; that is, an open string.

For [[Chord (music)|chords]], a letter above or below the tablature staff denotes the [[Root (chord)|root note]] of the chord.

'''Examples of guitar tablature notation:'''

The chords E, F, and G as an ASCII tab:

&lt;pre&gt;e|---0---1---3---
B|---0---1---0---
G|---1---2---0---
D|---2---3---0---
A|---2---3---2---
E|---0---1---3---
     E   F   G&lt;/pre&gt;

[[Image:Guitar tablature sample.svg|center|450px|thumb|Tablature for guitar in [[Standard tuning|standard tuning]] shown underneath [[Modern musical symbols|standard notation]]. ]]

Tablature can use various lines, arrows, and other symbols to denote [[Finger vibrato|bends]], [[hammer-on]]s, [[trill (music)|trills]], [[pull-off]]s, [[Slide (guitar technique)|slides]], and so on. These are the tablature symbols that represent various techniques, though these may vary:

Guitar tablature is not standardized and different sheet-music publishers adopt different conventions. Songbooks and guitar magazines usually include a legend setting out the convention in use.

The most common form of lute tablature uses the same concept but differs in the details (e.g., it uses letters rather than numbers for frets). See [[#French lute tablature|above]].

When circles are used to indicate fingering, sounded notes are white, an [[Absent root|assumed root]] is grey, and a sounded root is black.&lt;ref&gt;Latarski, Don (1999). ''Ultimate Guitar Chords: First Chords'', p.5. {{ISBN|978-0-7692-8522-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Latarski, Aaron Stang (1993). ''Practical Theory for Guitar'', p.6-7. {{ISBN|978-0-89898-692-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musette tablature==
[[Image:Borjon tab.png|thumb|300px|right|Musette tablature from Borjon de Scellery]]

The standard notation shown in the illustration is also taken from de Scellery; no explanation is given for the slur-like symbol; the comma (''',''') is explained as indicating a ''tremblement'', starting on the note above. No explanation is given for the unusual beaming or the significance (if any) of where note-length symbols are repeated.

==Harmonica tablature==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
For example, on a "C" diatonic instrument:
&lt;pre&gt;Unbent    Bent lv1    Bent lv2    Bent  lv3
3i (B)    3i|  (Bb)   3i|| (A)    3i||| (G#)&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;!-- The preceding preformat section should be replaced with a wikitable. Pipe symbols (|) can be displayed by enclosing them in &lt;nowiki&gt; tags. --&gt;

To indicate button-press on a chromatic instrument, a similar indication to first-level bending may be used.

The breath indicator may be placed right next to the hole number, or below the number. The same is true for bending or button-press indicators.

To indicate the beat, in the arrow system the length of the arrow may be varied. However, the more popular method is to use a slightly simplified rhythm-symbol notation, such as "o" for a semibreve, // for a minim, "/" for a crotchet, "." for quavers, and place them above the characters, while spacing them accordingly.

For chords, the numbers to play are shown, so, for example:
a C major (CEG) chord (on a C diatonic instrument): 456e
However, they may simplify it, especially when playing blues. For chords, it was common to just play three or two holes instead (sometimes even just one), especially when the instrument is not of the same key. For example, in the blues progression in G (G G G G7 C C G G D7 D7 G G) it is common to use a C diatonic instrument, and notate the following:
*G chord (G-B-D): 34i (BD)
*G7 chord (G-B–D-F): 45i (DF).
*D7 chord (D-F{{music|sharp}}-A-C): 4i (D) or 4e (C)

There are many harmonica tablature systems in use. The easiest tablature system works like this.

Diatonic Harmonica tablature

&lt;pre&gt; 2  = blow the 2 hole
-2  = draw the 2 hole
-2' = draw the 2 hole with a half bend
-2" = draw the 2 hole with a full bend&lt;/pre&gt;

chords are shown by grouping notes with parentheses

(2 3) = blow the 2 hole and the 3 hole at the same time

Chromatic Harmonica tablature

&lt;pre&gt;  2 = blow the 2 hole
 -2 = draw the 2 hole
 &lt;2 = blow the 2 hole with the button in
&lt;-2 = draw the 2 hole with the button in&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is an example of harmonica tablature:

"Mack the Knife"
C Diatonic
&lt;pre&gt;5   6   -6   -6   5  6   -6     -6
Oh the shark has pretty teeth, dear
-4  -5  -6    -6  -4 -5   -6
And he shows them pearly white
 6  -7  -8    7   -7   -6  7     -4
Just a jack knife has MacHeath, dear
 5  -5   7   -4  7  -7  -6
And he keeps it out of sight&lt;/pre&gt;

==Legal issues==
By early 2006, an unprecedented legal move was taken by the [[Music Publishers' Association]] (MPA), initiating legal action against tablature websites that hosted interpretations of songs and music. The MPA had been pushing for websites offering free tablatures to be shut down. MPA president Lauren Keiser said that their goal is for owners of free tablature services to face fines and even imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Youngs |first=Ian |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4508158.stm |title=BBC report |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-12-12 |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several websites that offered free tablature have taken their tablature off-line until a solution or compromise is found. One of the proposed solutions is an [[alternative compensation system]], which allows the widespread reproduction of digital copyrighted works while still paying [[songwriter]]s and copyright owners. In addition, there are now a number of "legal" services offering guitar tablature that have been licensed by music publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dave on August 5th, 2008 |url=http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/can-guitar-tabl.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130123163247/http://www.fretbase.com/fretbase/2008/08/can-guitar-tabl.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-01-23 |title=Fretbase, Can Guitar Tablature Go Legit? |publisher=Fretbase.com |date=2008-08-05 |accessdate=2011-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One site, MetalTabs.com, contacts the bands themselves for permission to post tablature. Few bands have declined the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metaltabs.com/ |title=metaltabs.com |publisher=metaltabs.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed ref|date=May 2015}}

The tablature debate was featured on [[NPR]]'s ''[[Morning Edition]]'' in a segment entitled "Music Industry Goes after Guitar Tablature Websites" on August 7, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Arnold |first=Chris |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5622879 |title=NPR report |publisher=Npr.org |date=2006-08-07 |accessdate=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2010, [[Ultimate Guitar]] (UG), a Russian, free on-line tablature site, entered a licensing agreement with [[Harry Fox Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harryfox.com/public/userfiles/file/PressReleases/HFAUltimateGuitar_20100406_Final.pdf |title=harryfox.com |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-12-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928051743/http://www.harryfox.com/public/userfiles/file/PressReleases/HFAUltimateGuitar_20100406_Final.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement included rights for lyrics display, title search and tablature display with download and print capabilities. HFA’s over 44,000 represented publishers have the opportunity to opt into the licensing arrangement with UG.

===Rise of legal guitar tablature sites===
In light of the legal questions surrounding user-created on-line guitar tablature, a number of companies have been formed that claim to offer consumers legal on-line tablature, which has been officially licensed from songwriters and/or music publishers. These companies offering legal content generally fall into three categories:

* Websites that offer "professionally-created" content: These websites typically hire professional musicians to transcribe songs into guitar tablature, and generally charge anywhere from $0.99 to $6.99 for the ability to purchase legal pieces of guitar tablature. These websites also claim to have acquired the proper licenses to display this tablature on-line. Several websites in this first category specifically cater to guitarists.
* Websites that offer "user-created" tablature, but have obtained the proper legal clearances to post these transcriptions on-line. There are several websites that fall into this second category, which generally do not charge consumers for using these user-created tablature pieces, and share any advertising revenue with music publishers and/or songwriters.
* Websites that index other tablature resources, and offer unique formatting options.

===Mxtabs.net===
Mxtabs.net closed because of copyright holder complaints. However, as of February 23, 2006, the owners of [http://www.mxtabs.net/ref.php?ref=2c5ceac94cc169e96dad5b33b3377dc5&amp;url=/ Mxtabs] put the website back on-line with a letter explaining their position. In short, they believe that the purpose of Mxtabs is to "...aid musicians in learning their instruments." They claim that Mxtabs has accounted for as much as $3000 a month in sheet music sales, and offers many tablatures that are not published in sheet music, so Mxtabs and similar sites are the only place that musicians can find a way to play these songs (other than figuring the songs out for themselves). The letter concludes by pointing out that nobody has shown that tablature renditions are illegal, then requesting that sheet-music companies contact Mxtabs to create a system of tablature licensing.

On February 29, 2008, MXTabs.net relaunched as the first legitimately licensed site designed to provide musicians with access to free tablatures, while also compensating music publishers and songwriters for their [[intellectual property]]. As with other [[user generated content]] sites, MXTabs.net users are encouraged to create, edit, rate, and review their own tablature interpretations of their favourite songs. However, unlike other user-generated content sites, only songs that have received explicit permission from participating copyright owners will be made available on-line.

===Guitar Tab Universe===
On 17 July 2006, Guitar Tab Universe (GTU) posted a letter on its home page that its [[Internet service provider|ISP]] had been jointly threatened with legal action by the [[National Music Publishers Association]] (NMPA) and the MPA "on the basis that sharing tablature constitutes copyright infringement".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitartabs.cc/letter.php Guitar Tab Universe letter].&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, GTU's site owner(s) immediately created a website named [[Music Student and Teacher Organization]] (MuSATO) to attempt to reposition themselves from an illegal-copyrighted-materials provider to an "education provider". MuSATO's main objective is to use [[fair use]] as their rationale to publish tablature [[free of charge]]. By claiming to be an educational provider, they do not have to obtain [[publication right]]s nor pay royalties to the original composers. MuSATO claims to be educational by classifying users downloading tablatures as "music students" and transcribers as "music teachers."

GuitarTabs.com has been contacted by the NMPA and MPA with similar copyright infringement allegations. The NMPA and MPA have also threatened Guitar Tab Universe with similar legal action. A copy of the certified letter received by the site owner, along with a brief note similar to the one posted on Mxtabs, has been posted on their website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guitartabs.com/nmpa.php Guitar Tab Universe MPA allegations].&lt;/ref&gt;

===OLGA.net===
The [[On-line Guitar Archive]] (OLGA)—OLGA.net is another tablature site that has been removed after receiving letters from lawyers representing the NMPA and the MPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.olga.net/ |title=The On-line Guitar Archive |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524070949/http://www.olga.net/ |archivedate=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=June 11, 2012}}
&lt;blockquote&gt;OLGA is currently offline while we attempt to resolve legal issues with the archive. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We received a 'take down' letter (pages 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 &amp; 6 ) from lawyers representing the NMPA and the MPA. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt; We greatly appreciate your support and hope to return to providing resources to the aspiring guitarist as soon as possible. Contact rcwoods for more information. In the meantime, we recommend the usenet newsgroups rec.music.makers.guitar.tablature and alt.guitar.tab.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Telexistence'''&lt;ref&gt;[[Susumu Tachi]], Telexistence, World Scientific Publishing Company, {{ISBN|978-981-283-633-5}}, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is fundamentally a concept named for the general [[technology]] that enables a [[human]] being to have a real-time sensation of being at a place other than where he or she actually exists, and being able to interact with the remote environment, which may be real, virtual, or a combination of both. It also refers to an advanced type of teleoperation system that enables an operator at the control to perform remote tasks dexterously with the feeling of existing in a surrogate [[robot]] working in a remote environment. Telexistence in the real environment through a virtual environment is also possible. This concept was first proposed by [[Susumu Tachi]] in Japan in 1980 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi, K.Tanie and K.Komoriya: Evaluation device of mobility aids for the blind,
 Japanese Patent 1462696 filed on December 26, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1981 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi, K.Tanie and K.Komoriya: Operation method of manipulators with sensoryinformation display functions, Japanese Patent 1458263 filed on January 14, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; as patents and the first report was published in Japanese in 1982 &lt;ref&gt;S.Tachi and M.Abe: Study on Telexistence (I) -Desigan of Visual Display-, Proceedings of the 21st SICE Annual Conference, pp.167-168, Tokyo, July 28–30, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; and in English in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="37806">'''Traditional ecological knowledge''' ('''TEK''') describes indigenous and other forms of traditional knowledge regarding sustainability of local resources. As a field of study in anthropology, TEK refers to "a cumulative body of knowledge, belief, and practice, evolving by  accumulation of TEK and handed down through generations through traditional songs, stories and beliefs. It is concerned with the relationship of living beings (including human) with their traditional groups and with their environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berkes|first=F.|date=1993|title=Traditional ecological knowledge in perspective|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/52/5/432/236145|journal=Traditional Ecological Knowledge: Concepts and Cases|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such knowledge is commonly used in [[natural resource management]] as a substitute for baseline environmental data to measure changes over time in remote regions that have little recorded scientific data.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, M.M.R. 1992. The nature and utility of traditional ecological knowledge. ''Northern Perspectives'', 20(1):9-12&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of traditional knowledge in this field in management and science is controversial since methods of acquiring and accumulating the knowledge, although often including forms of [[empirical research]] and [[experimentation]], differ from those used to create and [[Validity (logic)|validate]]  [[ecology|scientific ecological knowledge]] .&lt;ref&gt;McGregor, D. (2004). Coming full circle: indigenous knowledge, environment, and our future. ''American Indian Quarterly'', 28(3 &amp; 4), 385-410&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, C. D., Ghimire, K. (2003). Synergy between traditional ecological knowledge and conservation science supports forest preservation in Ecuador. ''Conservation Ecology'', 8(1): 1&lt;/ref&gt; Non-tribal government agencies, such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency have established integration programs with some tribal governments in order to utilize TEK in environmental plans and climate change tracking.

There is a debate whether   Indigenous populations retain an [[intellectual property]] right over traditional knowledge and whether use of this knowledge requires prior permission and license.&lt;ref&gt;Simeone, T. (2004). Indigenous traditional knowledge and intellectual property rights. Library of Parliament: PRB 03-38E. Parliamentary Research Branch Political and Social Affairs Division.&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially complicated because TEK is most frequently preserved as [[oral tradition]] and as such may lack [[objectivity (science)|objectively]] confirmed [[documentation]]. Ironically, those same methods that might resolve the issue of documentation compromise the very nature of traditional knowledge.

Traditional knowledge is often used to sustain local populations and maintain resources necessary for survival.&lt;ref&gt;AAAS - Science and Human Rights Program. 2008. 10 February 2009 &lt;http://shr.aaas.org/tek/connection.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it can be weakened or invalidated in the context of rapid [[climate change]], [[Environmental degradation|environmental impact]], or other situations in which significant alterations of [[ecosystem]]s render it weak or obsolete {{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}.

TEK can also be referred to as '''traditional environmental knowledge''' which emphasizes the different components and interactions of the environment. More specifically it contains the knowledge of species of both animals and plants, and biophysical characteristics of the environment through space and time.

== Development of the field ==
{{close paraphrasing|section|date=April 2017}}
The earliest systematic studies of traditional ecological knowledge were conducted in anthropology. Ecological knowledge was studied through the lens of ethnoecology, "an approach that focuses on the conceptions of ecological relationships held by a people or a culture," in understanding how systems of knowledge were developed by a given culture.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.umac.mo/ebooks/b10756577a.pdf|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge in Perspective|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|date=1993|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold C. Conklin|Harold Colyer Conklin]], an American anthropologist who pioneered the study of [[ethnoscience]], took the lead in documenting indigenous ways of understanding the natural world. Conklin and others documented how traditional peoples, such as Philippine horticulturists, displayed remarkable and exceptionally detailed knowledge about the natural history of places where they resided. Direct involvement in gathering, fashioning products from, and using local plants and animals created a scheme in which the biological world and the cultural world were tightly intertwined. Although the field of TEK began with documentation of lists of species used by different indigenous groups and their "taxonomies of plants, animals, and later, of other environmental features such as soils," the shift from documentation to consideration of functional relationships and mechanisms gave rise to the field as it is recognized today. In emphasizing the study of adaptive processes, which argues that social organization itself is an ecological adaptational response by a group to its local environment, human-nature relations and the practical techniques on which these relationships and culture depended, the field of TEK could analyze a broad range of questions related to [[cultural ecology]] and [[ecological anthropology]], .&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://umanitoba.ca/institutes/natural_resources/canadaresearchchair/Encyclopedia%20of%20Religion%20And%20Nature%20Traditional%20Ecological%20Knowledge.pdf|title=Traditional Ecological Knowledge|last=Berkes|first=Fikret|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid 1980s a growing body of literature on traditional ecological knowledge documented both the environmental knowledge held by   diverse indigenous peoples and their ecological relations.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The studies included examining "cultivation and biodiversity conservation in tropical ecosystems, and traditional knowledge and management systems in coastal fisheries and lagoons, semi-arid areas, and the Arctic." What these studies illustrated was that a variety of "traditional peoples had their own understandings of ecological relationships and distinct traditions of resource management." &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The rise of traditional ecological knowledge at this time led to international recognition of its potential applications in resource management practices and sustainable development. The 1987 report by the World Commission on Environment and Development reflects the consensus at the time. The report points out that the successes of the 20th century (decreases in infant mortality, increases in life expectancy, increases in literacy, and global food production) have given rise to trends that have caused environmental decay "in an ever more polluted world among ever decreasing resources."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/our-common-future.pdf|title=Report of the World Commission on Environment and Development: Our Common Future|last=|first=|date=March 20, 1987|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hope, however, existed for traditional lifestyles. The report declared that tribal and indigenous peoples had lifestyles that could provide modern societies with lessons in the management of resources in complex forest, mountain, and dryland ecosystems.

=== Differences  from science===
Fulvio Mazzocchi of the [[National Research Council (Italy)|Italian National Research Council]]'s Institute of Atmospheric Pollution contrasts traditional knowledge from scientific knowledge as follows:

{{quote|Traditional knowledge has developed a concept of the environment that emphasizes the symbiotic character of humans and nature. It offers an approach to local development that is based on co‐evolution with the environment, and on respecting the carrying capacity of ecosystems. This knowledge—based on long‐term empirical observations adapted to local conditions—ensures a sound use and control of the environment, and enables indigenous people to adapt to environmental changes. Moreover, it supplies much of the world's population with the principal means to fulfil their basic needs, and forms the basis for decisions and strategies in many practical aspects, including interpretation of meteorological phenomena, medical treatment, water management, production of clothing, navigation, agriculture and husbandry, hunting and fishing, and biological classification systems.... Beyond its obvious benefit for the people who rely on this knowledge, it might provide humanity as a whole with new biological and ecological insights; it has potential value for the management of natural resources, and might be useful in conservation education as well as in development planning and environmental assessment....Western science is positivist and materialist in contrast to traditional knowledge, which is spiritual and does not make distinctions between empirical and sacred. Western science is objective and quantitative as opposed to traditional knowledge, which is mainly subjective and qualitative. Western science is based on an academic and literate transmission, while traditional knowledge is often passed on orally from one generation to the next by the elders.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mazzocchi|first=Fulvio|date=2006-05-01|title=Western science and traditional knowledge|url=http://embor.embopress.org/content/7/5/463|journal=EMBO Reports|language=en|volume=7|issue=5|pages=463–466|doi=10.1038/sj.embor.7400693|issn=1469-221X|pmc=1479546|pmid=16670675}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Aspects of traditional ecological knowledge ==
The aspects of traditional ecological knowledge provide different typologies in how it is utilized and understood. These are good indicators in how it is used from different perspectives and how they are interconnected, providing more emphasis on "cooperative management to better identify areas of difference and convergence when attempting to bring two ways of thinking and knowing together."&lt;ref&gt;Houde, N. (2007) Ecology &amp; Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Factual observations ===
The first aspect of traditional ecological knowledge incorporates the factual, specific observations generated by recognition, naming, and classification of discrete components of the environment.  This aspect is about understanding the interrelationship with species and their surrounding environment. It is also a set of both empirical observations and information emphasizing the aspects of animals and their behavior, and habitat, and the physical characteristics of species, and animal abundance. This type of "empirical knowledge consists of a set of generalized observations conducted over a long period of time and reinforced by accounts of other TEK holders."&lt;ref&gt;Usher, P.J. 2000. Traditional Ecological Knowledge in environmental assessment and management&lt;/ref&gt;

===Management systems===
The second aspect refers to the ethical and sustainable use of resources in regards to management systems. This is achieved through strategic planning to ensure resource conservation. More specifically this face involves  dealing with pest management, resource conversion, multiple cropping patterns, and methods for estimating the state of resources.&lt;ref&gt;Berkes 1988, Gunn et all. 1988&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of ignorance toward traditional ecological knowledge is at the fault of management, these people are used to growing up in a more modern advanced system, they tend to ignore it.

===Past and current uses===
The  third face refers to time dimension aspect of traditional ecological knowledge, focusing on the past and current uses of the environment transmitted through oral history.&lt;ref&gt;Usher 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Oral history is also used to transmit cultural heritage through generation to generation to maintain the sense of family and community.

===Ethics and values===
The fourth face refers to value statements and connections between the belief system and the organization of facts. In regards to TEK it refers to environmental ethics that keeps exploitative abilities in check. This face also refers to the expression of values concerning the relationship with the habitats of species and their surrounding environment - the human-relationship environment.

===Culture and identity===
The fifth face refers to the role of language and images of the past giving life to culture.&lt;ref&gt;Houde 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Aboriginals (original inhabitants) and their environment are vital to sustaining the cultural components that define them. This face reflects the stories, values, and social relations that reside in places as contributing to the survival, reproduction, and evolution of aboriginal cultures, and identities. It also stresses "the restorative benefits of cultural landscapes as places for renewal"&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Sheppard 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmology===
This   aspect  is a culturally based cosmology that is the foundation of the other aspects. The combination relates to the assumptions and beliefs about how things work, and explains the way in which things are connected, and gives principles that regulate human-animal relations and the role of humans in the world. From an anthropological perspective, cosmology attempts to understand the human-animal relationship and how these directly influence social relationships, obligations toward community members, and management practices.

==Ecosystem management theory==
{{Main|Ecosystem management}}

Ecosystem management is a multifaceted and holistic approach to natural resource management. It incorporates both  science and traditional ecological knowledge to collect data from long term measures that science cannot. This is achieved by scientists and researchers collaborating with Indigenous peoples through a consensus decision-making process while meeting the socioeconomic, political and cultural needs of current and future generations.

==Traditional knowledge and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency==
{{POV section|date=April 2017}}

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was one of the first federal agencies to develop formal policies detailing how it would collaborate with tribal governments and acknowledge tribal interests in enacting its programs "to protect human health and the environment."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/tribal/epa-policy-administration-environmental-programs-indian-reservations-1984-indian-policy|title=EPA Policy for the Administration of Environmental Programs on Indian Reservations (1984 Indian Policy)|last=EPA, OITA, AIEO|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recognizing tribal peoples connection to the environment the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] has sought to develop environmental programs that integrate traditional ecological knowledge into the "agency's environmental science, policy, and decision-making processes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://semspub.epa.gov/work/HQ/500024668.pdf|title=Consideration of Tribal Treaty Rights and Traditional Ecological Knowledge|last=Woolford|first=James|date=January 17, 2017|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although TEK is not currently recognized as an important component of mainstream environmental decision making, scientists are working on developing core science competency programs that align with TEK and promote self-sufficiency and determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/region9/tribal/web/pdf/tribal-ecological-knowledge-env-sci-policy-dm.pdf|title=Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in Environmental Science, Policy and Decision-Making|last=|first=|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] issued Executive Order 13175, which required federal departments and agencies to consult with Indian Tribal governments in the development of policies that would have Tribal implications.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/nativeamerican/pdf/tek-j-sepez.pdf|title=Traditional Environmental Knowledge in Federal Natural Resource Management Agencies|last=Sepez|first=Jennifer|last2=Lazrus|first2=Heather|date=Winter 2005|website=U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal Implications are defined by the EPA as having "substantial direct effects on one or more Indian tribes, on the relationship between the federal government and Indian tribes, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities between the federal government and Indian tribes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-13175-consultation-and-coordination-indian-tribal|title=Summary of Executive Order 13175 - Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments|last=EPA, OA, OP, ORPM, RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a Federal agency of the U.S. government, the EPA was required to establish a set of standards for the consultation process. As its initial response, the agency developed a set of standards that would allow for meaningful communication and coordination between the agency and tribal officials prior to the agency taking actions or implementing decisions that may affect tribes. The standards also designated EPA consultation contacts to promote consistency and coordination of the consultation process, and established management oversight and reporting to ensure accountability and transparency.

One form of consultation has been EPA Tribal Councils. In 2000, the EPA's Office of Research and Development formed the EPA Tribal Science Council. The council, made up of representatives from tribes across the nation, is meant to provide a structure for tribal involvement in EPA's science efforts, and serve as a vehicle through which EPA may gain an understanding of the scientific issues that are of highest priority to tribes at a national level. The Council also offers tribes an opportunity to influence EPA’s scientific agenda by raising these priority issues to an EPA-wide group.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-02/documents/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title=Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2014|website=www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of importance for tribal members at the initial gathering of the EPA Tribal Science Council was the inherent differences in tribal traditional lifeways and western science. These lifeways include "spiritual, emotional, physical, and mental connections to the environment; connections which are based on intrinsic, immeasurable values"; and an understanding that the earth’s resources will provide everything necessary for human survival.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

The EPA's Tribal Science Council, however, was meant to act as a meeting place where both groups could "share information that may contribute to environmental protection for all peoples with neither culture relinquishing its identity." In an effort to protect TTL the Council identified subsitence as a critical area for investigation. The EPA-Tribal Science Council defined subsistence as: the "relationships between people and their surrounding environment, a way of living. Subsistence involves an intrinsic spiritual connection to the earth, and includes an understanding that the earth’s resources will provide everything necessary for human survival. People who subsist from the earth’s basic resources remain connected to those resources, living within the circle of life. Subsistence is about living in a way that will ensure the integrity of the earth’s resources for the beneficial use of generations to come." Because TTL or TEK is specific to a location and includes the relationships between plants and animals, and the relationship of living beings to the environment, acknowledgment of subsitence as a priority allows for the knowledge and practices of TTL to be protected. For example, as part of their deliberation regarding subsistence, the Council agreed to identify resource contamination as “the most critical tribal science issue at this time.” Because tribal people with subsistence lifestyles rely the environment for traditional techniques of farming, hunting. fishing, forestry, and medicines, and ceremonies, contaminants  disproportionately impact tribal peoples and jeopardizes their TTL. As the EPA Council stated, "Tribal subsistence consumption rates are typically many times higher than those of the general population, making the direct impact of resource contamination a much more immediate concern."&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; As native peoples struggle with tainted resources, the Council has made progress in investigating its impacts.

Despite such efforts, there are still barriers to progress within the EPA-Tribal Science Council. For example, one obstacle has been the nature of TTL. Tribal Traditional Lifeways are passed down orally, from person to person, generation to generation, whereas western science relies on the written word, communicated through academic and literate transmission.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Endeavors to bring together western scientists and tribal people have also been hindered by Native American's perceptions that scientific analysis are put in a metaphorical “black box” that shuts out tribal input. Regardless, the EPA has recognized the ability of indigenous knowledge to advance scientific understanding and provide new information and perspectives that may benefit the environment and human health.

The integration of TTL into the EPA's risk assessment paradigm is one example of how the EPA-Tribal Science Council has been able to enact change in EPA culture. The risk assessment paradigm is an "organizing framework for the scientific analysis of the potential for harmful impacts to human health and the environment as a result of exposure to contaminants or other environmental stressors." Risk assessment has been used by the EPA to establish "clean-up levels at hazardous waste sites, water quality and air quality criteria, fish advisories, and bans or restricted uses for pesticides and other toxic chemicals."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/region9/tribal/web/pdf/tribal-ecological-knowledge-env-sci-policy-dm.pdf|title=Integration of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) in Environmental Science, Policy and Decision-Making|last=|first=|date=June 2011|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tribal people are concerned, however, that current risk assessment methodologies do not afford complete value to tribal culture, values, and/or life ways. The Tribal Science Council seeks to incorporate TTL into exposure assumptions existent in the EPA risk assessment model. A long-term goal for the  EPA’s Tribal Science Council, however, is a complete shift in decision-making assessments from risk to preserving a healthy people and environment. As stated above, tribal people do not accept a separation of the human and ecological condition when they characterize risk. Through EPA initiated seminar, workshops, and projects, tribes have been able to engage in dialogue about the integration of Tribal Traditional Lifeways into EPA risk assessment and decision-making. This has occurred in a number of ways: inclusion of unique tribal cultural activities such as native basketry, the importance of salmon and other fishes, native plant medicine, consumption of large amounts of fish and game, and sweat lodges as exposures for estimating potential risk to people or to communities. Although these types of tribal specific activities may be included in EPA's risk assessment, there is no assurance that they will be included nor is there consistency in how they may be applied at different sites across the country.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In July 2014, the EPA announced its “Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples," setting forth its principles for programs related to [[federally recognized tribes]] and indigenous peoples in order to "support the fair and effective implementation of federal environmental laws, and provide protection from disproportionate impacts and significant risks to human health and the environment."&lt;ref name="Policy"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.epa.gov/partners/web/pdf/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title= EPA Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2014|website=|access-date=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the 17 principles were #3 ("The EPA works to understand definitions of human health and the environment from the perspective of federally recognized tribes, indigenous peoples throughout the United States, and others living in Indian country"); #6 ("The EPA encourages, as appropriate and to the extent practicable and permitted by law, the integration of traditional ecological knowledge into the agency’s environmental science, policy, and decision-making processes, to understand and address environmental justice concerns and facilitate program implementation"); and #7 ("The EPA considers confidentiality concerns regarding information on sacred sites, cultural resources, and other traditional knowledge, as permitted by law.").&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2015-02/documents/ej-indigenous-policy.pdf|title=EPA Policy on Environmental Justice for Working with Federally Recognized Tribes and Indigenous Peoples|last=McCarthy|first=Gina|date=|website=|access-date=}} {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this policy identifies guidelines and procedures for the EPA in regards to environmental justice principles as they relate to tribes and indigenous peoples, the agency noted that they are in no way applicable as [[United States administrative law#Rulemaking|rules or regulations]]. They cannot be applied to particular situations nor change or substitute any law, regulation, or any other legally-binding requirement and is not legally enforceable.&lt;ref name="Policy"/&gt;

==Effects on environmental degradation on traditional knowledge==
In some areas, [[environmental degradation]] has led to a decline in traditional ecological knowledge. For example, at the [[Aamjiwnaang First Nation|Aamjiwnaang]] community of [[Anishnaabe]] First Nations people in [[Sarnia, Ontario]], Canada, residents suffer from a "noticeable decrease in [[Human sex ratio|male birth ratio]] ..., which residents attribute to their proximity to petrochemical plants":&lt;ref name="Hoover"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoover|first=Elizabeth|year=2012|title=Indigenous Peoples of North America: Environmental Exposures and Reproductive Justice|jstor=23323091|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=120|pages=1645–1649|doi=10.1289/ehp.1205422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In addition to concerns about the physical reproduction of community members, indigenous people are concerned about how environmental contamination impacts the reproduction of cultural knowledge. In Aamjiwnaang, oral traditions once passed down from grandfathers during fishing or grandmothers during berry picking and medicine gathering are being lost as those activities are no longer practiced because of concerns about these foods being contaminated. Rocks once used for sweat lodges are no longer being collected from local streams because the streams have become contaminated. The cedar used for making tea, smudging, and washing babies contains vanadium at concentrations as high as 6 mg/kg..., reflecting local releases to air of &gt; 611 tons of vanadium between 2001 and 2010.... At Akwesasne, community members report a loss of language and culture around subsistence activities like fishing, which have been largely abandoned because of fears of exposure to contaminants.&lt;ref name="Hoover"/&gt;}}

==Climate change==
[[File:Indigenous people and Climate Change.pdf|thumb|upright|Indigenous people and Climate Change: fact sheet about the health impacts of climate change on indigenous populations.]]

Traditional ecological knowledge provides information about climate change across generations and geography of the actual residents in the area.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ignatowski|first1=Jonathan Andrew|last2=Rosales|first2=Jon|title=Identifying the exposure of two subsistence villages in Alaska to climate change using traditional ecological knowledge|journal=Climatic Change|volume=121|issue=2|pages=285–299|doi=10.1007/s10584-013-0883-4|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0883-4|accessdate=5 April 2017|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional ecological knowledge emphasizes and makes the information about the health and interactions of the environment the center of the information it carries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moffa|first1=Anthony|title=Traditional Ecological Rulemaking|url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moffa.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]] affects traditional ecological knowledge in the forms of the indigenous people’s identity and the way they live their lives.

The rising temperature poses as threats for ecosystems because it harms the livelihoods of certain tree and plant species. The combination of the rise in temperatures and change in precipitation levels affects plant growth locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change Threats and Solutions|url=https://www.nature.org/ourinitiatives/urgentissues/global-warming-climate-change/threats-solutions/|website=The Nature Conservancy|accessdate=22 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has wiped out much of the salmonids and acorns which make up a significant portion of the Karuk people's food. The increase in temperatures has stunted the wild rice's ability to grow and that has a negative influence on the Anishinaabe people's lifestyle.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"&gt;{{cite web|title=Indigenous Peoples, Lands, and Resources|url=http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/sectors/indigenous-peoples#|website=Global Change|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ojibwe people are also affected by the rising temperature's effect on rice growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The warming also affects insects and animals. The change in temperatures can affect many aspects from the times that insects emerge throughout the year to the changes in the habitats of animals throughout seasonal changes. In Maine, the loss of certain habitats and the increase in temperatures, especially in the colder seasons, encourages the survival of ticks that harm the moose population.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

As the temperature gets hotter, wild fires become more likely. Not only are different aspects of the environment are affected, but together, the health of the ecosystem is affected by climate change and so the environmental resources available to the indigenous people can change in the amount available and the quality of the resources.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

The [[Navajo Nation]] peoples in the Southwestern United States are victims to the pollution in the air. Climate change increases chances for droughts which lead to the dangers of airborne dust to be picked up from the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

	Water resources are also affected. In particular, about a third of the Navajo Nation people need to physically attain their own water. Damage to their water resources poses as dangers to overall health and crop failures. In Arizona, the Fort Apache reservation's children are victims to the rising temperatures in their water which allows more impurities to grow in the water and causes them to have diarrhea and stomach problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As sea ice levels decrease, Alaska Native peoples experience changes in their daily lives; fishing, transportation, social and economic aspects of their lives become more unsafe. The Native peoples residing on the Gulf and West Coasts are affected by the rising sea temperatures because that makes the fish and shellfish, that they rely on for food and cultural activities, more susceptible to contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Climate Change and the Health of Indigenous Populations|url=https://www3.epa.gov/climatechange/impacts/health/factsheets/indigenous-health-climate-change.pdf|website=EPA United States Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=5 April 2017|date=May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defrosting of soil has caused damages to buildings and roadways. Water contamination becomes exacerbated as clean water resources dwindle.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt;

Climate changes undermine the daily lives of the Native peoples on many levels. For example, to immediately deal with these conditions, the indigenous people adjust when they harvest and what they harvest and also adjust their resource use. Climate change can change the accuracy of the information of traditional ecological knowledge. The indigenous people have relied deeply on indicators in nature to plan activities and even for short- term weather predictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vinyeta|first1=Kirsten|last2=Lynn|first2=Kathy|title=Exploring the role of traditional ecological knowledge in climate change initiative|url=https://permanent.access.gpo.gov/gpo37896/pnw_gtr879.pdf|publisher=Portland, OR: U. S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Pacific Northwest Research Station|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of even more increasing unfavorable conditions, the indigenous people relocate to find other ways to survive. As a result, there is a loss of cultural ties to the lands they once resided on and there is also a loss to the traditional ecological knowledge they had with the land there.&lt;ref name="nca2014.globalchange.gov"/&gt; Climate change adaptations not properly structured or implemented can harm the indigenous people's rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Raygorodetsky|first1=Gleb|title=Why Traditional Ecological Knowledge Holds the Key to Climate Change|url=https://unu.edu./publications/articles/why-traditional-knowledge-holds-the-key-to-climate-change.html|website=United Nations University|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EPA has mentioned that it would take traditional ecological knowledge into consideration in planning adaptations to climate change. The [[National Resource Conservation Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] has used methods of the indigenous people to combat climate change conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moffa|first1=Anthony|title=Traditional Ecological Rulemaking|url=https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/moffa.pdf|accessdate=16 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case Study: Savoonga and Shaktoolik, Alaska===

In one study, villagers of Savoonga and Shaktoolik, Alaska reported that over the last twenty years of their lives, the weather has become more difficult to predict, the colder season has shortened, there is more difficulty in predicting the amount of plants available for harvests, there are differences in animal migrations, there are more sightings of new species than before, and the activities of hunting and gathering have become not as predictable nor occur as often due to more limited availability to do so. The residents saw a noticeable change in their climate which also affected their livelihoods. The plants and animals are not as consistent with their availability which affects the residents' hunting and gathering because there is not as much to hunt or gather. The appearance of new species of plants and animals is also a physical and nutritional safety concern because they are not traditionally part of the land.&lt;ref name="link.springer.com"/&gt;

[[File:Vietnamese Calligraphy.jpg|thumb|right|Fonts in the style of Vietnamese Latin calligraphy]]

'''Vietnamese calligraphy''' (Vietnamese Quốc ngữ: thư pháp Việt Nam, Hán Nôm: 書法越南) refers to the [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] traditions of Vietnam.  It can refer to calligraphic works using a variety of scripts, including [[Chinese characters]], [[Chữ nôm]], and the Latin-based [[Quốc ngữ]].  Historically, calligraphers used the former two scripts.  However, due to the adoption of the Latin-based Quốc ngữ, modern Vietnamese calligraphy also uses Roman characters.

Traditional Vietnamese calligraphy is strongly affected by that of China.  As part of the East Asian cultural spheres, Classical Chinese was often used as the written medium of communication, and as a result, Vietnamese calligraphy thus also follows Chinese calligraphy’s standard and use Han script (Chinese language) in many of its writings. For example, during the [[Lý dynasty]], its style was very much similar to China’s [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907), during the [[Trần dynasty]], it was influenced strongly by China’s [[Song dynasty|Song]] (960-1279) and [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] (1271-1368) dynasties&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://vietnamnews.vn/life-style/350055/new-book-tells-story-of-vn-calligraphy.html#6ebrFO7wJy6J0uqO.97|title=New book tells story of VN calligraphy|last=|first=|date=|work=Vietnam News|access-date=19 March 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Nonetheless, over time, Vietnam developed its own styles of calligraphy for writing both Classical Chinese and [[Chữ Nôm|Chữ nôm]]. In [[Lê dynasty|Later Le dynasty]], Vietnam developed a unique style of calligraphy which was called Nam tự (南字）by Phạm Đình Hổ (範廷琥) in his book Vũ Trung Tùy Bút (雨中隨筆)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Vũ Trung Tùy Bút|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Modern Vietnamese calligraphy is undoubtedly influenced by modern Latin [[cursive]], but is written using the [[ink brush|calligraphy brush]], rather than quill or reed pens as is done in Western calligraphy.  Much as Chinese calligraphy is used to write poems, festive banners, signage, and so on, Vietnamese calligraphy can also serve the same purpose today.

'''Women as theological figures''' have played a significant role in the development of various [[religions]] and religious [[hierarchy|hierarchies]]. The study of '''[[women and religion]]''' typically examines the role of [[women]] within particular religious faiths, and religious doctrines relating to [[gender]], [[gender roles]], and particular women in [[religious history]]. It is worth noting from  a gender scientific approach, women occupy the second room in all of the following religions in the examples below. 

George H. Gallup Jr. wrote in an analysis for the Gallup Organization in 2002 that, a mountain of evidence shows that women have more religiosity than men. Gallup goes on to say that women hold on to their faith more heartily, work harder for the church, and in general practice with more consistency than men.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Roy Britt, ''Women More Religious Than Men, http://www.livescience.com/7689-women-religious-men.html, February 28, 2009'' October 27, 2014 (2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bahá'í Faith ==
{{details|Bahá'í Faith and gender equality#Historical women figures in Bahá'í history}}

In Bahá'i writings, the [[Holy Spirit]] is often described as the "[[Maid of Heaven]]".&lt;ref name="Abdo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/abdo_female_holy-spirit |title=Female Representations of the Holy Spirit in Bahá'í and Christian writings and their implications for gender roles |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three women figure prominently in the history of the Bahá'í Faith: [[Táhirih]], a disciple of the [[Báb]]; [[Ásíyih Khánum]], the wife of [[Bahá'u'lláh]]; and [[Bahíyyih Khánum]] the daughter of Bahá'u'lláh. Táhirih and Bahíyyih, in particular, held strong leadership positions and are seen vital to the development of the religion.

Several women played leading roles in the early days of the Bahá'í Faith in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetbahai.org/cgi-bin/articles.pl?article=93 |title=Women in the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Planetbahai.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/mazal_comparison_christianity_bahai&amp;chapter=2 |title=Selected Topics of Comparison in Christianity and the Baha'i Faith |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/finch_unclipping_wings |title=Unclipping the Wings |publisher=Bahai-library.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them are: [[May Maxwell]], [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Corinne True], and [[Martha Root]].  [[Rúhíyyih Khanum]] and a mix of male and female [[Hands of the Cause]] formed an interim leadership of the religion for six years prior to the formation of the [[Universal House of Justice]]. Later prominent women include [http://www.bahai.us/node/80 Patricia Locke], [http://www.creativefilms.com/Pos.html Jaqueline Left Hand Bull Delahunt], [[Layli Miller-Muro]], and [http://bahai-library.com/maneck_women_bahai_faith Dr. Susan Maneck], who herself wrote books documenting the role of women in the Bahá'í Faith.

== Jainism ==
The status of women in Jainism differs between the two main sects, [[Digambar]]a and [[Svetambara]]. Jainism prohibits women from appearing naked; because of this, Digambaras, who consider renunciation of clothes essential to [[moksha (Jainism)|moksha]], say that they cannot attain enlightenment in the same life.&lt;ref name="bbcethics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/jainism/beliefs/women.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics - Women in Jainism |publisher=BBC |date=2009-09-10 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Svetambaras, who allow [[sadhu]]s to wear clothes, believe that women can attain moksha. There are more Svetambara sadhvis than sadhus and women have always been influential in the Jain religion.&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/t/the-jain-faith/ |title=The Role of Women - Victoria and Albert Museum |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date=2007-02-20 |accessdate=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
