The '''45th [[Pacific Islands Forum]]''' was held from 29 July to 1 August 2014 in [[Palau]].&lt;ref name="Radio Australia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/2014-07-28/pacific-leaders-to-discuss-climate-change-sustainable-fishing-during-pacific-islands-forum-in-palau/1348872 | title=Pacific leaders to discuss climate change, sustainable fishing during Pacific Islands Forum in Palau | publisher=Radio Australia | date=28 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forum's official opening was held in the capital [[Ngerulmud]], in [[Melekeok|Melekeok State]], but the majority of events were held in [[Koror]], Palau's largest city and former capital.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palaupif.com/annex.html Calendar of Events] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121121157/http://www.palaupif.com/annex.html |date=21 January 2015 }} –  Palau PIF. Retrieved 21 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The official theme of the meeting was "The Ocean: Life &amp; Future". Topics under discussion include [[climate change]], commercial fishing, non-communicable diseases and the possibility of readmitting [[Fiji]] to the forum.

== Overview ==
The Pacific Islands Forum is an [[Intergovernmentalism|inter-governmental]] organization that aims to enhance cooperation between the independent countries of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. It was founded in 1971 as the South Pacific Forum. In 1999, the name was changed; Pacific Islands Forum is more inclusive of the Forum's [[Oceania]]-spanning membership of both north and south Pacific [[island country|island countries]] and [[Australia]]. It is an official observer at the [[United Nations]].

The mission of Pacific Islands Forum is “to work in support of Forum member governments, to enhance the economic and social well-being of the people of the South Pacific by fostering cooperation between governments and between international agencies, and by representing the interests of Forum members in ways agreed by the Forum”. Its decisions are implemented by the ''[[Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat]]'' (PIFS), which grew out of the ''South Pacific Bureau for Economic Co-operation'' (SPEC). As well as its role in harmonising regional positions on various political and policy issues, the Forum Secretariat has technical programmes in economic development, transport and trade. The Pacific Islands Forum Secretary General is the permanent Chairman of the [[Council of Regional Organisations in the Pacific]] (CROP).&lt;ref name="About Us"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forumsec.org/pages.cfm/about-us/ | title=About Us | publisher=Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat | accessdate=29 July 2014 | last=Unattributed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Issues ==
[[President of Palau]] [[Tommy Remengesau]] declared the official theme of the Forum would be "The Ocean: Life &amp; Future",&lt;ref name="Global Times"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/873131.shtml | title=Pacific Islands Forum to open in Palau | publisher=Global Times | work=Xinhua News Agency | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the major focus on the issue of climate change amidst concern over rising sea levels and sinking islands in the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref name="MSN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.msn.com/world/pacific-summit-to-urge-action-on-climate-change | title=Pacific summit to urge action on climate change | publisher=MSN | work=AFP | date=28 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the solution to the problem of rising seas as well as ocean warming and acidification is the reduction of CO2 emissions.&lt;ref name="Yahoo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://news.yahoo.com/climate-concerns-aired-pacific-summit-opens-155515666.html | title=Climate concerns aired as Pacific summit opens | publisher=Yahoo! | work=AFP | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacific islands leaders plan to produce a follow-up to the [[Majuro Declaration]], which was passed at the 44th Pacific Islands Forum with the support of [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt; [[Secretary General of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat]] [[Tuiloma Neroni Slade]] commended Remengesau for the choice of theme, noting "it is a theme that is most timely with considerable strategic significance in the lead up to the 3rd UN conference on Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) to be held in [[Samoa]], in September."&lt;ref name="Global Times" /&gt;

Other topics on the agenda for the Forum include commercial fishing and non-communicable diseases.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt; Earlier this year, President Remengesau proposed a ban on commercial fishing in Palau. Bans and other ways to promote marine conservation will be discussed at the Forum.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt; Leaders are upset that despite the lucrative nature of the Pacific tuna fishing industry, worth approximately four billion US dollars per year, it is poorly managed and little of the money trickles back to Pacific countries.&lt;ref name="Yahoo" /&gt; Prevalence of smoking and obesity are widespread in the Pacific, and leaders in Palau want to discuss ways to reduce these problems at the Forum. To model good practices, smoking has been banned during the course of the event, and dietary guidelines have been put in place for food served at all meetings during the event.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt;

The readmission of [[Fiji]] to the [[Pacific Islands Forum]] was also discussed at the Forum. Fiji was [[Pacific Islands Forum#Suspension of Fiji|banned]] in 2009 after the military government that took power in the [[2006 Fijian coup d'état]] promised elections in 2009 but failed to hold them.&lt;ref name="ABC Australia"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-07-29/pacific-islands-forum-gets-underway-in-palau/5633780 | title=Leaders gather in Palau for Pacific Islands Forum | publisher=Australia Network News | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014 | author=Schwartz, Dominque}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, readmission is unlikely to occur before the [[Fijian general election, 2014|Fijian election]] in September.&lt;ref name="MSN" /&gt; [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[John Key]] said he would discuss allowing Fiji to return to the Forum, but [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Fiji)|Foreign Minister of Fiji]] [[Ratu]] [[Inoke Kubuabola]] previously stated that Fiji would not consider reapplying unless Australia and New Zealand were banned from the forum.&lt;ref name="Radio Australia" /&gt;

== Representatives ==
In addition to representatives from each of the 15 participating countries, representatives of major powers such as the [[United States]], [[China]], [[India]], and the [[European Union]] also attended the forum.&lt;ref name="MSN" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Jet"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thejetnewspaper.com/2014/07/29/eu-high-representative-to-attend-pacific-islands-forum-in-palau/ | title=EU High Representative to Attend Pacific Islands Forum in Palau | publisher=The Jet | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Former [[White House Chief of Staff]] and current [[Counselor to the President]] [[John Podesta]] led the US delegation at the forum, a group including senior officials from the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], [[United States Pacific Command]], [[United States Coast Guard]], [[United States Department of State]], [[United States Department of the Interior]], [[Peace Corps]], [[United States Agency for International Development]], and [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref name="RTCC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rtcc.org/2014/07/29/podesta-heads-to-pacific-climate-meet-nz-and-aus-pms-decline/ | title=Podesta heads to Pacific climate meet, NZ and Aus PMs decline | publisher=Responding to Climate Change | date=29 July 2014 | accessdate=29 July 2014 | author=Yeo, Sophie}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delegation of the European Union was led by [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] for the EU and [[Vice-President of the European Commission]] [[Catherine Ashton]].&lt;ref name="The Jet" /&gt; Ashton will speak at a plenary session on 30 July and host a dinner that same evening. Her goals are to discuss issues of mutual interest such as climate change and increase strategic relations between the EU and Pacific islands. The EU has already agreed to provide over 750 million Euros for bilateral and regional cooperation.&lt;ref name="The Jet" /&gt;

[[Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Tony Abbott]] and [[Prime Minister of New Zealand]] [[John Key]], heads of government of the two largest participating countries in the Forum, were both unable to attend.&lt;ref name="RTCC" /&gt; Tony Abbott was occupied with matters concerning the crash of [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]]. The Australian delegation was led by [[Deputy Prime Minister of Australia]] [[Warren Truss]] and [[Parliamentary Secretary#Australia|Parliamentary Secretary]] [[Brett Mason]].&lt;ref name="ABC Australia" /&gt; 
The New Zealand delegation was led by Foreign Minister [[Murray McCully]], who promised a $5 million programme to update navigation maps for the region, and to help protect Pacific fisheries.

The [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand]] condemned Key for not attending the forum, and accused both leaders of not caring deeply enough about the effects of climate change.&lt;ref name="RTCC" /&gt;

== Results ==

[[Image:Wiki-sixtynine.png|thumb|A man and a woman performing mutual [[oral sex]] in the 69 position.]]
'''Sixty-nine''' or '''69''', also known by its [[French language|French]] name '''soixante-neuf''' (69),&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web |title=Soixante-neuf definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary |url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/soixante-neuf |website=www.collinsdictionary.com |publisher=[[Collins English Dictionary]] |accessdate=8 July 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a group of [[sex position]]s in which two people align themselves so that each person's mouth is near the other's genitals, each simultaneously performing [[oral sex]] on the other.&lt;ref name="little"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rojiere|first=Jean|title=The Little Book of Sex|publisher=Ulysses Press|year=2001|isbn=1-56975-305-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Julie Coleman, "Love, sex, and marriage: a historical thesaurus", Rodopi, 1999, {{ISBN|90-420-0433-9}}, p.214&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aggrawal&gt;{{cite book |last=Aggrawal |first=Anil|authorlink=Anil Aggrawal|title=[[Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects of Sexual Crimes and Unusual Sexual Practices]] |year=2009 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Boca Raton |isbn=1-4200-4308-0|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; The participants are thus mutually inverted like the numerals 6 and 9 in the [[69 (number)|number 69]], hence the name.&lt;ref name=aggrawal/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;René James Hérail, Edwin A. Lovatt, "Dictionary of Modern Colloquial French", Routledge, 1990, {{ISBN|0-415-05893-7}}, p.484&lt;/ref&gt; This position can involve any combination of sexes.

==Method==
Variations of the 69 positions include mutual [[Anal–oral sex|anilingus]] or "double rimming", and [[fingering (sexual act)|digital penetration]] of either partner's [[anus]] or [[vagina]].

In these positions, the partners are said to experience [[sexual stimulation]] simultaneously, but this can also distract those who try to focus solely on pleasuring themselves. The position can also be awkward for partners who are not similar in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==History==
Mutual simultaneous oragenitalism is usually referred to in English under the euphemistic French numerical form, “''soixante-neuf''{{r|collins}}.” The ancient Chinese [[Yin and Yang]] (female &amp; male) symbol is identical. ... The term “''soixante-neuf''” has not been traced any earlier than the ''Whore’s Catechism''s published in the 1790s in France, usually attributed to the early leader of the French Revolution, Mlle. [[Théroigne de Méricourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt;

"The earliest unequivocal representation of the sixty-nine appears to be that on an oil-lamp preserved in the [[Munich]] Museum ([[Deutsches Museum]]), and first reproduced in Dr. Gaston Vorberg’s … portfolio, ''Die Erotik der Antiken in Kleinkunst und Keramik'' (Munich, 1921) plate 58, showing the woman lying on top of the man. Dr. Vorberg gives this … to be of the period of the Roman Caesars … . However, another oil-lamp of the same kind, showing the sixty-nine almost identically … is more recently reproduced as a full-color plate, in Prof. [[Jean Marcadé]]’s ''Eros Kalos'' (English-language edition, [[Geneva]] : Nagel, 1965), facing page 58, in … lamps preserved in the [[Heraklion Archaeological Museum|Heracleion Museum]] in [[Greece]]."&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 290&lt;/ref&gt;

"A [[Hindu]] temple-sculpture from the sacred caverns of the island of [[Elephanta Island|Elephanta]], near [[Mumbai]] in [[India]], showing this position with the man actually standing, and holding the woman hanging down in this from his shoulders, was … brought to England in the late eighteenth century … . … this sculptured fragment … is both discussed and illustrated in [[Richard Payne Knight]]’s ''A Discourse on the Worship of [[Priapus]]'', privately issued for the [[Dilettanti Society]] of London in 1786 … . The illustration in question is a detail engraving given in Payne Knight’s plate XI; and the full form of this sculptured group is … given as plate XXIV."&lt;ref&gt;Legman 1969, p. 301&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' mentions this sex position, albeit by a different name: "When a man and woman lie down in an inverted order, i.e. with the head of the one towards the feet of the other and carry on [mouth] congress, it is called the 'congress of a crow'."&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:simple stellar aberration diagram.svg|thumb|The apparent position of a star viewed from the Earth depends on the Earth's velocity. The effect is typically much smaller than illustrated.]]

The '''aberration of light''' (also referred to as '''astronomical aberration''', '''stellar aberration''', or '''velocity aberration''') is an [[Astronomy|astronomical]] phenomenon which produces an [[apparent place|apparent motion]] of celestial objects about their true positions, dependent on the velocity of the observer. Aberration causes objects to appear to be displaced towards the direction of motion of the observer compared to when the observer is stationary. The change in angle is typically very small — of the order of ''v/c'' where ''c'' is the [[speed of light]] and ''v'' the [[velocity]] of the observer. In the case of "stellar" or "annual" aberration, the apparent position of a star to an observer on Earth varies periodically over the course of a year as the Earth's velocity changes as it [[orbital revolution|revolves]] around the Sun, by a maximum angle of approximately 20&amp;nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s in [[right ascension]] or [[declination]].

The term ''aberration'' has historically been used to refer to a number of related phenomena concerning the propagation of light in moving bodies.&lt;ref name="schaffner"&gt;{{Citation
|author=Schaffner, Kenneth F.
|date=1972
|title= Nineteenth-century aether theories
|publisher=Pergamon Press
|location= Oxford
|pages=99–117 und 255–273
|isbn=0-08-015674-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Aberration should not be confused with ''[[stellar parallax|parallax]]''. The latter is a change in the apparent position of a relatively nearby object, as measured by a moving observer, relative to more distant objects that define a reference frame. The amount of parallax depends on the ''distance'' of the object from the observer, whereas aberration does not. Aberration is also related to [[light-time correction]] and [[relativistic beaming]], although it is often considered separately from these effects.

Aberration is historically significant because of its role in the development of the theories of [[light]], [[electromagnetism]] and, ultimately, the theory of [[special relativity]]. It was first observed in the late 1600s by astronomers searching for stellar parallax in order to confirm the [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] of the Solar System.

which he used to make one of the earliest measurements of the speed of light. However, Bradley's theory was incompatible with 19th century theories of light, and aberration became a major motivation for the [[aether drag hypothesis|aether drag theories]] of [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Augustin Fresnel]] (in 1818) and [[George Gabriel Stokes|G. G. Stokes]] (in 1845), and for [[Hendrik Lorentz]]'s [[Lorentz ether theory|aether theory]] of electromagnetism in 1892. The aberration of light, together with Lorentz's elaboration of [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's electrodynamics]], the [[moving magnet and conductor problem]], the [[Michelson–Morley experiment|negative aether drift experiments]], as well as the [[Fizeau experiment]], led [[Albert Einstein]] to develop the theory of special relativity in 1905, which presents a general form of the equation for aberration in terms of such theory.&lt;ref name="norton"&gt;{{Citation|author=Norton, John D. |date=2004 |first1=John D. |journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences |title=Einstein's Investigations of Galilean Covariant Electrodynamics prior to 1905 |pages=45–105 |volume=59 |url=http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001743/ |doi=10.1007/s00407-004-0085-6 |bibcode=2004AHES...59...45N |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111103932/http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/archive/00001743/ |archivedate=2009-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation==
[[File:Sun earth relativistic aberration.svg|thumb|300px|Light rays striking the earth in the Sun's rest frame compared to the same rays in the Earth's rest frame according to special relativity. The effect is exaggerated for illustrative purposes.]]

Aberration may be explained as the difference in angle of a beam of light in different [[inertial frames of reference]]. A common analogy is to consider the apparent direction of falling rain. If rain is falling vertically in the frame of reference of a person standing still, then to a person moving forwards the rain will appear to arrive at an angle, requiring the moving observer to tilt their umbrella forwards. The faster the observer moves, the more tilt is needed.

The net effect is that light rays striking the moving observer from the sides in a stationary frame will come angled from ahead in the moving observer's frame. This effect is sometimes called the "searchlight" or "headlight" effect.

In the case of annual aberration of starlight, the direction of incoming starlight as seen in the Earth's moving frame is tilted relative to the angle observed in the Sun's frame. Since the direction of motion of the Earth changes during its orbit, the direction of this tilting changes during the course of the year, and causes the apparent position of the star to differ from its true position as measured in the inertial frame of the Sun.

While classical reasoning gives intuition for aberration, it leads to a number of physical paradoxes observable even at the classical level (see [[#Historical_theories_of_aberration|history]]). The theory of [[special relativity]] is required to correctly account for aberration. The relativistic explanation is very similar to the classical one however, and in both theories aberration may be understood as a case of [[vector space|addition of velocities]].

===Classical explanation===
In the Sun's frame, consider a beam of light with velocity equal to the speed of light c, with x and y velocity components &lt;math&gt;u_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u_y&lt;/math&gt;, at an angle &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta) = u_y/u_x&lt;/math&gt;. If the Earth is moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; in the x direction relative to the Sun, then by velocity addition the x component of the beam's velocity in the Earth's frame of reference is &lt;math&gt;u_x' = u_x + v&lt;/math&gt;, and the y velocity is unchanged, &lt;math&gt;u_y' = u_y&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the angle of the light in the Earth's frame in terms of the angle in the Sun's frame is

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac{u_y'}{u_x'} = \frac{u_y}{u_x+v} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{v/c + \cos(\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of &lt;math&gt;\theta = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, this result reduces to &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta - \phi) = v/c&lt;/math&gt;, which in the limit &lt;math&gt;v/c \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; may be approximated by &lt;math&gt;\theta - \phi = v/c&lt;/math&gt;. 
===Relativistic explanation===
The reasoning in the relativistic case is the same except that the [[Velocity-addition formula|relativistic velocity addition]] formulas must be used, which can be derived from [[Lorentz transformations]] between different frames of reference. These formulae are

:&lt;math&gt;u_x' = (u_x + v)/(1+u_x v/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;u_y' = u_y / \gamma (1+u_x v/c^2)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma = 1/\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt;, giving the components of the light beam in the Earth's frame in terms of the components in the Sun's frame. The angle of the beam in the Earth's frame is thus &lt;ref name=Mould&gt;{{cite book |title=Basic Relativity |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=lfGE-wyJYIUC&amp;pg=PA8 |isbn=0-387-95210-1 |date=2001 |publisher=Springer |author=Richard A. Mould |edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac{u_y'}{u_x'} = \frac{u_y}{\gamma(u_x+v)} = \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\gamma(v/c + \cos(\theta))}&lt;/math&gt;

In the case of &lt;math&gt;\theta = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, this result reduces to &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta - \phi) = v/c&lt;/math&gt;, and in the limit &lt;math&gt;v/c \ll 1&lt;/math&gt; this may be approximated by &lt;math&gt;\theta - \phi = v/c&lt;/math&gt;. This relativistic derivation keeps the speed of light &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{u_x^2 + u_y^2} = c&lt;/math&gt; constant in all frames of reference, unlike the classical derivation above.

===Relationship to light-time correction and relativistic beaming===
[[File:aberrationlighttimebeaming.gif|thumb|400px|Aberration, light-time correction, and relativistic beaming can be considered the same phenomenon depending on the frame of reference.]]

Aberration is related to two other phenomena, [[light-time correction]], which is due to the motion of an observed object during the time taken by its light to reach an observer, and [[relativistic beaming]], which is an angling of the light emitted by a moving light source. It can be considered equivalent to them but in a different inertial frame of reference. In aberration, the observer is considered to be moving relative to a (for the sake of simplicity&lt;ref&gt;In fact, the light source doesn't need to be stationary, consider for example eclipsing binary stars: they are rotating with high speed —and ever changing and different velocity vectors— around each other, but they appear as '''one''' spot all the time.&lt;/ref&gt;) stationary light source, while in light-time correction and relativistic beaming the light source is considered to be moving relative to a stationary observer.

Consider the case of an observer and a light source moving relative to each other at constant velocity, with a light beam moving from the source to the observer. At the moment of emission, the beam in the observer's rest frame is tilted compared to the one in the source's rest frame, as understood through relativistic beaming. During the time it takes the light beam to reach the observer the light source moves in the observer's frame, and the 'true position' of the light source is displaced relative to the apparent position the observer sees, as explained by light-time correction. Finally, the beam in the observer's frame at the moment of observation is tilted compared to the beam in source's frame, which can be understood as an aberrational effect. Thus, a person in the light source's frame would describe the apparent tilting of the beam in terms of aberration, while a person in the observer's frame would describe it as a light-time effect.

The relationship between these phenomena is only valid if the observer and source's frames are inertial frames. In practice, because the Earth is not an inertial rest frame but experiences centripetal [[acceleration]] towards the Sun, many aberrational effects such as annual aberration on Earth cannot be considered light-time corrections. However, if the time between emission and detection of the light is short compared to the orbital period of the Earth, the Earth may be approximated as an inertial frame and aberrational effects are equivalent to light-time corrections.

==Types of aberration==
There are a number of types of aberration, caused by the differing components of the Earth's and observed object's motion:

* '''Annual aberration''' is due to the orbital [[orbit|revolution]] of the Earth around the Sun.
* '''Planetary aberration''' is the combination of aberration and light-time correction.
* '''Diurnal aberration''' is due to the [[Earth's rotation|rotation]] of the Earth about its own axis.
* '''Secular aberration''' is due to the motion of the Sun and [[Solar System]] relative to other stars in our [[Galaxy]].

===Annual aberration===
[[File:Aberration3.svg|thumb|250px|Stars at the [[ecliptic pole]]s appear to move in circles, stars exactly in the ecliptic plane move in lines, and stars at intermediate angles move in ellipses. Shown here are the apparent motions of stars with the [[ecliptic latitude]]s corresponding to these cases, and with [[ecliptic longitude]] of 270°.]]
[[File:aberrationseasons.svg|thumb|250px|The direction of aberration of a star at the northern ecliptic pole differs at different times of the year]]
{{see also|Stellar parallax}}

Annual aberration is caused by the motion of an observer on [[Earth]] as the planet revolves around the [[Sun]]. Due to [[orbital eccentricity]], the [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; of Earth (in the Sun's rest frame) [[Kepler orbit|varies]] periodically during the year as the planet traverses its [[elliptic orbit]] and consequently the aberration also varies periodically, typically causing stars to [[stellar parallax|appear to move]] in small [[ellipse]]s.

Approximating [[Earth's orbit]] as circular, the maximum displacement of a star due to annual aberration is known as the ''constant of aberration'', conventionally represented by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. It may be calculated using the relation &lt;math&gt;\kappa = \theta-\phi \approx v/c &lt;/math&gt; substituting the Earth's average speed in the Sun's frame for &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and the [[speed of light]] &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;. Its accepted value is 20.49552 &amp;nbsp;[[minute and second of atc|arcseconds]] (at [[J2000]]).&lt;ref name="kovalevsky"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Jean |last1=Kovalevsky |first2=P. Kenneth |last2=Seidelmann |last-author-amp=yes |date=2004 |title=Fundamentals of Astrometry
|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-521-64216-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Assuming a [[circular orbit]], annual aberration causes stars exactly on the [[ecliptic]] (the plane of Earth's orbit) to appear to move back and forth along a straight line, varying by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; on either side of their position in the Sun's frame. A star that is precisely at one of the [[ecliptic pole]]s (at 90° from the ecliptic plane) will appear to move in a circle of radius &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; about its true position, and stars at intermediate [[ecliptic coordinate system|ecliptic latitudes]] will appear to move along a small [[ellipse]].

For illustration, consider a star at the northern ecliptic pole viewed by an observer at a point on the [[Arctic Circle]]. Such an observer will see the star [[culmination|transit]] at the [[zenith]], once every day (strictly speaking [[sidereal day]]). At the time of the [[March equinox]], Earth's orbit carries the observer in a southwards direction, and the star's apparent [[declination]] is therefore displaced to the south by an angle of &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;. On the [[September equinox]], the star's position is displaced to the north by an equal and opposite amount. On either [[solstice]], the displacement in declination is 0. Conversely, the amount of displacement in [[right ascension]] is 0 on either [[equinox]] and at maximum on either solstice.

&lt;!-- In the [[equatorial coordinate system]], the aberration's effect in [[right ascension]] (east-west) is larger than the effect in [[declination]] (north-south) except at the ecliptic poles. Despite this, its effect in declination was the first observed because very accurate clocks are needed to measure such a small variation in right ascension, but a [[transit telescope]] calibrated with a [[plumb bob|plumb line]] can detect very small changes in declination.
--&gt;
In actuality, Earth's orbit is slightly elliptic rather than circular, and its speed varies somewhat over the course of its orbit, which means the description above is only approximate. Aberration is more accurately calculated using  Earth's instantaneous velocity relative to the [[barycenter]] of the Solar System.&lt;ref name=kovalevsky/&gt;

Note that the displacement due to aberration is orthogonal to any displacement due to [[parallax]]. If parallax were detectable, the maximum displacement to the south would occur in December, and the maximum displacement to the north in June. It is this apparently anomalous motion that so mystified early astronomers.

====Solar annual aberration====
A special case of annual aberration is the nearly constant deflection of the Sun from its position in the Sun's rest frame by &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; towards the ''west'' (as viewed from Earth), opposite to the apparent motion of the Sun along the ecliptic (which is from west to east, as seen from Earth). The deflection thus makes the Sun appear to be behind (or retarded) from its rest-frame position on the ecliptic by a position or angle &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt;.

This deflection may equivalently be described as a light-time effect due to motion of the Earth during the 8.3&amp;nbsp;minutes that it takes light to travel from the Sun to Earth. This is possible since the transit time of sunlight is short relative to the orbital period of the Earth, so the Earth's frame may be approximated as inertial. In the Earth's frame, the Sun moves by a distance &lt;math&gt;\Delta x = vt&lt;/math&gt; in the time it takes light to reach Earth, &lt;math&gt;t=R/c&lt;/math&gt; for the orbit of radius &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;. This gives an angular correction &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta) \approx \theta = \Delta x/R&lt;/math&gt; which can be solved to give &lt;math&gt;\theta = v/c = \kappa&lt;/math&gt;, the same as the aberrational correction.

===Planetary aberration===
{{see also|Light-time correction}}
Planetary aberration is the combination of the aberration of light (due to Earth's velocity) and light-time correction (due to the object's motion and distance), as calculated in the rest frame of the Solar System. Both are determined at the instant when the moving object's light reaches the moving observer on Earth. It is so called because it is usually applied to planets and other objects in the Solar System whose motion and distance are accurately known.

===Diurnal aberration===
Diurnal aberration is caused by the velocity of the observer on the surface of the [[Earth's rotation|rotating Earth]]. It is therefore dependent not only on the time of the observation, but also the [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] of the observer. Its effect is much smaller than that of annual aberration, and is only 0.32 [[minute and second of arc|arcseconds]] in the case of an observer at the [[Equator]], where the rotational velocity is greatest.&lt;ref name=newcomb/&gt;

===Secular aberration===
The Sun and Solar System are revolving around the center of the Galaxy. Aberration due to this motion is known as secular aberration and affects the apparent positions of distant stars and [[extragalactic astronomy|extragalactic]] objects. However, since the [[galactic year]] is about 230 million years, the aberration varies very slowly and this change is extremely difficult to observe. Therefore, secular aberration is usually ignored when considering the positions of stars. In other words, star maps show the observed apparent positions of the stars, not their calculated true positions after accounting for secular aberration.

For stars significantly less than 230 million [[light years]] away, the Solar System may be approximated as an inertial frame and so the effect of secular aberration is equivalent to a light-time correction. This includes stars in the [[Milky Way]], since the Milky Way is about 100,000 light years in diameter. For these stars the true position of the star is then easily computed from its [[proper motion]] and its distance.

Secular aberration is typically a small number of [[arcminutes]], for example the stationary star [[Groombridge 1830]] is displaced by approximately 3&amp;nbsp;arcminutes,&lt;ref name="newcomb"&gt;

This is roughly 8 times the effect of annual aberration, as one would expect since the velocity of the Solar System relative to the center of the Galaxy is about 8 times the velocity of the Earth relative to the Sun.

==Discovery and first observations==
The discovery of the aberration of light was totally unexpected, and it was only by considerable perseverance and perspicacity that [[James Bradley|Bradley]] was able to explain it in 1727. It originated from attempts to discover whether stars possessed appreciable [[stellar parallax|parallaxes]].

===Search for stellar parallax===
The [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] [[heliocentricity|heliocentric]] theory of the [[Solar System]] had received confirmation by the observations of [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] and [[Tycho Brahe]] and the mathematical investigations of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]].{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}} As early as 1573, [[Thomas Digges]] had suggested that parallactic shifting of the stars should occur according to the heliocentric model, and consequently if stellar parallax could be observed it would help confirm this theory.  Many observers claimed to have determined such parallaxes, but Tycho Brahe and [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] concluded that they existed only in the minds of the observers, and were due to instrumental and personal errors. However, in 1680 [[Jean Picard]], in his ''Voyage d’[[Uraniborg|Uranibourg]],'' stated, as a result of ten [[year]]s' observations, that [[Polaris]], the Pole Star, exhibited variations in its position amounting to 40″ annually. Some astronomers endeavoured to explain this by parallax, but these attempts failed because the motion differed from that which parallax would produce. [[John Flamsteed]], from measurements made in 1689 and succeeding years with his mural quadrant, similarly concluded that the declination of Polaris was 40″ less in July than in September. [[Robert Hooke]], in 1674, published his observations of [[Gamma Draconis|γ Draconis]], a star of [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] 2&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; which passes practically overhead at the latitude of London (hence its observations are largely free from the complex corrections due to [[atmospheric refraction]]), and concluded that this star was 23″ more northerly in July than in October.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}}

===James Bradley's observations===
[[File:Bradley's observations of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis as reduced by Busch.jpg|thumb|Bradley's observations of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis as reduced by Busch to the year 1730.]]

Consequently, when Bradley and [[Samuel Molyneux]] entered this sphere of research in 1725, there was still considerable uncertainty as to whether stellar parallaxes had been observed or not, and it was with the intention of definitely answering this question that they erected a large telescope at Molyneux's house at [[Kew]].&lt;ref name="Hirshfeld"/&gt; They decided to reinvestigate the motion of γ Draconis with a telescope constructed by [[George Graham (clockmaker)|George Graham]] (1675–1751), a celebrated instrument-maker. This was fixed to a vertical chimney stack in such manner as to permit a small oscillation of the eyepiece, the amount of which (i.e. the deviation from the vertical) was regulated and measured by the introduction of a screw and a plumb line.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}}

The instrument was set up in November 1725, and observations on γ Draconis were made starting in December. The star was observed to move 40″ southwards between September and March, and then reversed its course from March to September. {{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=54}} At the same time, [[HD 40873|35 Camelopardalis]], a star with a right ascension nearly exactly opposite to that of γ Draconis, was 19" more northerly at the beginning of March than in September.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, James; Rigaud, Stephen Peter (1832). Miscellaneous works and correspondence of the Rev. James Bradley, D.D., F.R.S. Oxford: University Press. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; These results were completely unexpected and inexplicable by existing theories.

===Early hypotheses===
[[File:Hypothetical movement of γ Draconis caused by parallax.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical observation of γ Draconis if its movement was caused by parallax.]]

[[File:Hypothetical movement of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis caused by nutation.jpg|thumb|Hypothetical observation of γ Draconis and 35 Camelopardalis if their movements were caused by nutation.]]

Bradley and Molyneux discussed several hypotheses in the hope of finding the solution. Since the apparent motion was evidently caused neither by parallax nor observational errors, Bradley first hypothesized that it could be due to oscillations in the orientation of the Earth's axis relative to the celestial sphere&amp;nbsp;– a phenomenon known as [[astronomical nutation|nutation]]. 35 Camelopardalis was seen to possess an apparent motion which could be consistent with nutation, but since its declination varied only one half as much as that of γ Draconis, it was obvious that nutation did not supply the answer{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=55}} (however, Bradley later went on to discover that the Earth does indeed nutate).&lt;ref name=berry/&gt; He also investigated the possibility that the motion was due to an irregular distribution of the [[Earth's atmosphere]], thus involving abnormal variations in the refractive index, but again obtained negative results.{{sfn|Eppenstein|1911|p=55}}

On August 19, 1727, Bradley embarked upon a further series of observations using a telescope of his own erected at the Rectory, [[Wanstead]]. This instrument had the advantage of a larger field of view and he was able to obtain precise positions of a large number of stars over the course of about twenty years. During his first two years at Wanstead, he established the existence of the phenomenon of aberration beyond all doubt, and this also enabled him to formulate a set of rules that would allow the calculation of the effect on any given star at a specified date.

===Development of the theory of aberration===
Bradley eventually developed his explanation of aberration in about September 1728 and this theory was presented to the [[Royal Society]] in mid January the following year. One well-known story was that he saw the change of direction of a wind vane on a boat on the Thames, caused not by an alteration of the wind itself, but by a change of course of the boat relative to the wind direction.&lt;ref name="berry"&gt;

However, there is no record of this incident in Bradley's own account of the discovery, and it may therefore be [[apocrypha]]l.

The following table shows the magnitude of deviation from true declination for γ Draconis and the direction, on the planes of the solstitial [[colure]] and ecliptic prime meridian, of the tangent of the velocity of the Earth in its orbit for each of the four months where the extremes are found, as well as expected deviation from true ecliptic longitude if Bradley had measured its deviation from right ascension:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Month !! Direction of tangential velocity of Earth on the plane of the solstitial colure !! Deviation from true declination of γ Draconis !! Direction of tangential velocity of Earth on the plane of the ecliptic prime meridian !! Expected deviation from true ecliptic longitude of γ Draconis
|-
| December || zero || none || ← (moving toward perihelion at fast velocity) || decrease of more than 20.2"
|-
| March || ← (moving toward aphelion) || 19.5" southward || zero || none
|-
| June || zero || none || → (moving toward aphelion at slow velocity) || increase of less than 20.2"
|-
| September || → (moving toward perihelion) || 19.5" northward || zero || none
|}

Bradley proposed that the aberration of light not only affected declination, but right ascension as well, so that a star in the pole of the ecliptic would describe a little ellipse with a diameter of about 40", but for simplicity, he assumed it to be a circle. Since he only observed the deviation in declination, and not in right ascension, his calculations for the maximum deviation of a star in the pole of the ecliptic are for its declination only, which will coincide with the diameter of the little circle described by such star. For eight different stars, his calculations are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Star !! Annual Variation (") !! Maximum deviation in declination of a star in the pole of the ecliptic (")
|-
| γ Draconis || 39 || 40.4
|-
| β Draconis || 39 || 40.2
|-

|-
| 35 Camel. || 19 || 40.2
|-
| Capella || 16 || 40.0
|-
| MEAN || || 40.4
|}

Based on these calculations, Bradley was able to estimate the constant of aberration at 20.2", which is equal to 0.00009793 radians, and with this was able to estimate the speed of light at {{convert|183300|mi|km}} per second.&lt;ref name=EB&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor-first=Dale H. |editor-last=Hoiberg|encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=aberration, constant of|edition = 15th |date=2010|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica Inc. |volume=I: A-ak Bayes |location=Chicago, IL |isbn=978-1-59339-837-8|pages=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By projecting the little circle for a star in the pole of the ecliptic, he could simplify the calculation of the relationship between the speed of light and the speed of the Earth's annual motion in its orbit as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\frac{1}{2}\pi-0.00009793) = \sin(0.00009793) = \frac{v}{c} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the speed of light to the speed of the Earth's annual motion in its orbit is "10210 to one, from whence it would follow, that light moves, or is propagated as far as from the Sun to the Earth in 8' 12"."&lt;ref name=J_Bradley/&gt;

The discovery and elucidation of aberration is now regarded as a classic case of the application of [[scientific method]], in which observations are made to test a theory, but unexpected results are sometimes obtained that in turn lead to new discoveries. It is also worth noting that part of the original motivation of the search for stellar parallax was to test the Copernican theory that the Earth revolves around the Sun, but of course the existence of aberration also establishes the truth of that theory.

==Historical theories of aberration==
The phenomenon of aberration became a driving force for many physical theories during the 200 years between its observation and the conclusive explanation by Albert Einstein.

The first classical explanation was provided in 1729, by James Bradley as described above, who attributed it to the finite [[speed of light]] and the motion of [[Earth]] in its orbit around the [[Sun]].&lt;ref name="Bradley"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hirshfeld"/&gt; However, this explanation proved inaccurate once the wave nature of light was better understood, and correcting it became a major goal of the 19th century theories of [[luminiferous aether]]. [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] proposed a correction due to the motion of a medium (the aether) through which light propagated, known as [[Aether drag hypothesis|"partial aether drag"]]. He proposed that objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move, and this became the accepted explanation for aberration for some time. [[George Gabriel Stokes|George Stokes]] proposed a similar theory, explaining that aberration occurs due to the flow of aether induced by the motion of the Earth. Accumulated evidence against these explanations, combined with new understanding of the electromagnetic nature of light, led [[Hendrik Lorentz]] to develop an [[Lorentz ether theory|electron theory]] which featured an immobile aether, and he explained that objects contract in length as they move through the aether. Motivated by these previous theories, [[Albert Einstein]] then developed the theory of [[special relativity]] in 1905, which provides the modern account of aberration.

===Bradley's classical explanation===
[[File:Stellar aberration.JPG|thumb|250px |Figure 2: As light propagates down the telescope, the telescope moves requiring a tilt to the telescope that depends on the speed of light. The apparent angle of the star ''φ'' differs from its true angle ''θ''.]]

Bradley conceived of an explanation in terms of a [[corpuscular theory of light]] in which light is made of particles unaffected by gravity.&lt;ref name="schaffner"/&gt; His classical explanation appeals to the motion of the earth relative to a beam of light-particles moving at a finite velocity, and is developed in the Sun's frame of reference, unlike the classical derivation given above.

Consider the case where a distant star is motionless relative to the Sun, and the star is extremely far away, so that parallax may be ignored. In the rest frame of the Sun, this means light from the star travels in parallel paths to the Earth observer, and arrives at the same angle regardless of where the Earth is in its orbit. Suppose the star is observed on Earth with a telescope, idealized as a narrow tube. The light enters the tube from the star at angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; and travels at speed &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; taking a time &lt;math&gt;h/c&lt;/math&gt; to reach the bottom of the tube, where it is detected. Suppose observations are made from Earth, which is moving with a speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. During the transit of the light, the tube moves a distance &lt;math&gt;vh/c&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, for the particles of light to reach the bottom of the tube, the tube must be inclined at an angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; different from &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, resulting in an ''apparent'' position of the star at angle &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;. As the Earth proceeds in its orbit it changes direction, so &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; changes with the time of year the observation is made. The apparent angle and true angle are related using trigonometry as:

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { h\sin(\theta)}{hv/c + h \cos (\theta)}=\frac { \sin(\theta)}{v/c +  \cos (\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;.

In the case of &lt;math&gt;\theta = 90^\circ&lt;/math&gt;, this gives &lt;math&gt;\tan(\theta - \phi) = v/c&lt;/math&gt;. While this is different from the more accurate relativistic result described above, in the limit of small angle and low velocity they are approximately the same, within the error of the measurements of Bradley's day. These results allowed Bradley to make one of the earliest measurements of the [[Speed of light#History|speed of light]].&lt;ref name=J_Bradley&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=35 |pages=637–661 |date=1729 |author =James Bradley |title=An account of a new discovered motion of the fixed stars |doi=10.1098/rstl.1727.0064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76818/James-Bradley/76818rellinks/Related-Links Encyclopædia Britannica] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131111091006/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/76818/James-Bradley/76818rellinks/Related-Links |date=2013-11-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the left side of Figure 1, the case of infinite light speed is shown. '''S''' represents the '''s'''pot where the star light enters the telescope, and '''E''' the position of the '''e'''ye piece. If light moves instantaneously, the telescope does not move, and the true direction of the star relative to the observer can be found by following the line '''ES'''. However, if light travels at finite speed, the Earth, and therefore the eye piece of the telescope, moves from '''E''' to '''E′''' during the time it takes light to travel from '''S''' to '''E'''. Consequently, the star will no longer appear in the center of the eye piece. The telescope must therefore be adjusted. When the telescope is at position '''E''' it must be oriented toward spot '''S′''' so that the star light enters the telescope at spot '''S′'''. The star light will travel along the line '''SE′''' and reach '''E′''' exactly when the moving eye piece also reaches '''E′'''. Since the telescope has been adjusted by the angle '''SES′''', the star's apparent position is hence displaced by the same angle.

For the simple case where the direction of the light beam along the line '''SE''' is perpendicular to the motion of the observer then only light emitted at an angle equal to the arc cosine of the ratio of the observer's speed to the speed of light will reach the telescope. Consequently, the telescope too must be oriented at this same angle away from the light beam's trajectory in the direction of the motion to capture this emitted light.&lt;ref&gt;Tolman, R.C., "The theory of the relativity of motion", University of California Press, Berkeley (1917), p.59&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

[[File:Stellar aberration versus the dragged aether.gif|thumb|250px|Young reasoned that aberration could only be explained if the aether were immobile in the frame of the Sun. On the left, stellar aberration occurs if an immobile aether is assumed, showing that the telescope must be tilted. On the right, the aberration disappears if the aether moves with the telescope, and the telescope does not need to be tilted.]]
In the early nineteenth century the wave theory of light was being rediscovered, and in 1804 [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] adapted Bradley's explanation for corpuscular light to wavelike light traveling through a medium known as the luminiferous aether. His reasoning was the same as Bradley's, but it required that this medium be immobile in the Sun's reference frame and must pass through the earth unaffected, otherwise the medium (and therefore the light) would move along with the earth and no aberration would be observed.

{{Quote|Upon consideration of the phenomena of the aberration of the stars I am disposed to believe that the luminiferous aether pervades the substance of all material bodies with little or no resistance, as freely perhaps as the wind passes through a grove of trees.|Thomas Young|1804&lt;ref name="schaffner"/&gt;}}

However, it soon became clear Young's theory could not account for aberration when materials with a non-vacuum [[index of refraction]] were present. An important example is of a telescope filled with water. The velocity of the light in such a telescope will be slower than in vacuum, and is given by &lt;math&gt;c/n&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of refraction of the water. Thus, by Bradley and Young's reasoning the aberration angle is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { \sin(\theta)}{v/(c/n) +  \cos (\theta)}&lt;/math&gt;.

which predicts a medium-dependent angle of aberration. When refraction at the telescope's [[Objective (optics)|objective]] is taken into account this result deviates even more from the vacuum result. In 1810 [[François Arago]] performed a similar experiment and found that the aberration was unaffected by the medium in the telescope, providing solid evidence against Young's theory. This experiment was subsequently verified by many others in the following decades, most accurately by [[George Biddell Airy|Airy]] in 1871, with the same result.&lt;ref name="whittaker"/&gt;

===Aether drag models===
{{See also|Aether drag hypothesis}}

====Fresnel's aether drag====
In 1818, [[Augustin Fresnel]] developed a modified explanation to account for the water telescope and for other aberration phenomena. He explained that the aether is generally at rest in the Sun's frame of reference, but objects partially drag the aether along with them as they move. That is, the aether in an object of index of refraction &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; moving at velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is partially dragged with a velocity &lt;math&gt;(1-1/n^2)v&lt;/math&gt; bringing the light along with it. This factor is known as "Fresnel's dragging coefficient". This dragging effect, along with refraction at the telescope's objective, compensates for the slower speed of light in the water telescope in Bradley's explanation.{{efn|
More in detail, Fresnel explains that the incoming light of angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is first refracted at the end of the telescope, to a new angle &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; within the telescope. This may be accounted for by [[Snell's law]], giving &lt;math&gt;\sin(\theta - \phi) = n \sin(\psi - \phi)&lt;/math&gt;. Then drag must be accounted for. Without drag, the x and y components of the light in the telescope are &lt;math&gt;(c/n) \sin(\psi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(c/n) \cos(\psi)&lt;/math&gt;, but drag modifies the x component to &lt;math&gt;(c/n) \cos(\psi) - (1-1/n^2)v&lt;/math&gt; if the Earth moves with velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is angle and &lt;math&gt;v_l&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity of the light with these velocity components, then by Bradley's reasoning
&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { h \sin(\alpha)}{v t +  h \cos (\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is the modified path length through the water and t is the time it takes the light to travel the distance h, &lt;math&gt;t = h/v_l&lt;/math&gt;. Upon solving these equations for &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; one obtains Bradley's vacuum result.

&lt;!--Even more in detail: By trigonometry,
:&lt;math&gt;\sin(\alpha) = (c/n) \sin(\psi)/v_l&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\cos(\alpha) = ((c/n) \cos(\psi) - (1-1/n^2)v)/v_l&lt;/math&gt;
Plugging these into the first equation gives
:&lt;math&gt;\tan(\phi) = \frac { \sin(\psi)}{v/nc + \cos (\psi)}&lt;/math&gt;.
and then incorporating Snell's law gives Bradley's vacuum result.--&gt;

}}     With this modification Fresnel obtained Bradley's vacuum result even for non-vacuum telescopes, and was also able to predict many other phenomena related to the propagation of light in moving bodies. Fresnel's dragging coefficient became the dominant explanation of aberration for the next decades.

[[File:Stokes aether drag.svg|thumb|250px|Conceptual illustration of Stokes' aether drag theory. In the rest frame of the Sun the Earth moves to the right through the aether, in which it induces a local current. A ray of light (in red) coming from the vertical becomes dragged and tilted due to the flow of aether.]]

====Stokes' aether drag====
However, the fact that light is [[Polarization (waves)|polarized]] (discovered by Fresnel himself) led scientists such as [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] and [[George Green (mathematician)|Green]] to believe that the aether was a totally immobile elastic solid as opposed to Fresnel's fluid aether. There was thus renewed need for an explanation of aberration consistent both with Fresnel's predictions (and Arago's observations) as well as polarization.

In 1845, [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|Stokes]] proposed a 'putty-like' aether which acts as a liquid on large scales but as a solid on small scales, thus supporting both the transverse vibrations required for polarized light and the aether flow required to explain aberration. Making only the assumptions that the fluid is [[Potential flow|irrotational]] and that the [[Boundary value problem|boundary conditions]] of the flow are such that the aether has zero velocity far from the Earth, but moves at the Earth's velocity at its surface and within it, he was able to completely account for aberration.{{efn|
[[File:Stokes aether drag proof.svg|center|600px|The propagating wavefront moving through the aether.]]
Stokes' derivation may be summarized as follows: Consider a wavefront moving in the downwards z direction. Say the aether has velocity field &lt;math&gt;u,v,w&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;x,y,z&lt;/math&gt;. Now, motion of the aether in the x and y directions does not affect the wavefront, but the motion in the z direction advances it (in addition to the amount it advances at speed c). If the z velocity of the aether varies over space, for example if it is slower for higher x as shown in the figure, then the wavefront becomes angled, by an angle &lt;math&gt;\tan(\alpha) = tdw/dx &lt;/math&gt;. Now, say in time t the wavefront has moved by a span &lt;math&gt;dz \approx c t&lt;/math&gt; (assuming the speed of the aether is negligible compared to the speed of light). Then for each distance &lt;math&gt;dz&lt;/math&gt; the ray descends, it is bent by an angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx (dw/dx) (dz/c)&lt;/math&gt;, and so the total angle by which it has changed after travelling through the entire fluid is

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \approx \frac{1}{c} \int \frac{\partial w}{\partial x} dz&lt;/math&gt;

If the fluid is [[Potential flow|irrotational]] it will satisfy the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]], one of which is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial w}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}&lt;/math&gt;.

Inserting this into the previous result gives an aberration angle &lt;math&gt; \alpha = (u_2 - u_1)/c&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;s represent the x component of the aether's velocity at the start and end of the ray. Far from the earth the aether has zero velocity, so &lt;math&gt;u_2 = 0&lt;/math&gt; and at the surface of the earth it has the earth's velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;. Thus we finally get

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \approx \frac{v}{c}&lt;/math&gt;

which is the known aberration result. 
}}
The velocity of the aether outside of the Earth would decrease as a function of distance from the Earth so light rays from stars would be progressively dragged as they approached the surface of the Earth. The Earth's motion would be unaffected by the aether due to [[D'Alembert's paradox]].

Both Fresnel and Stokes' theories were popular. However, the question of aberration was put aside during much of the second half of the 19th century as focus of inquiry turned to the electromagnetic properties of aether.

===Lorentz' length contraction===
{{See also|Lorentz ether theory}}
In the 1880s once electromagnetism was better understood, interest turned again to the problem of aberration. By this time flaws were known to both Fresnel's and Stokes' theories. Fresnel's theory required that the relative velocity of aether and matter to be different for light of different colors, and it was shown that the boundary conditions Stokes had assumed in his theory were inconsistent with his assumption of irrotational flow.&lt;ref name="schaffner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="whittaker"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jan&gt;{{Citation|author=Janssen, Michel|author2=Stachel, John|last-author-amp=yes |editor=John Stachel |title=Going Critical |publisher=Springer|isbn=1-4020-1308-6|date=2010|chapter=The Optics and Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies|chapter-url=http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/Preprints/P265.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the modern theories of electromagnetic aether could not account for aberration at all. Many scientists such as [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]], [[Oliver Heaviside|Heaviside]] and [[Heinrich Hertz|Hertz]] unsuccessfully attempted to solve these problems by incorporating either Fresnel or Stokes' theories into [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwell's new electromagnetic laws]].

Hendrik Lorentz spent considerable effort along these lines. After working on this problem for a decade, the issues with Stokes' theory caused him to abandon it and to follow Fresnel's suggestion of a (mostly) stationary aether (1892, 1895). However, in Lorentz's model the aether was ''completely'' immobile, like the electromagnetic aethers of Cauchy, Green and Maxwell and unlike Fresnel's aether. He obtained Fresnel's dragging coefficient from modifications of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory, including a modification of the time coordinates in moving frames ("local time"). In order to explain the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] (1887), which apparently contradicted both Fresnel's and Lorentz's immobile aether theories, and apparently confirmed Stokes' complete aether drag, Lorentz theorized (1892) that objects undergo "[[length contraction]]" by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1-v^2/c^2}&lt;/math&gt; in the direction of their motion through the aether. In this way, aberration (and all related optical phenomena) can be accounted for in the context of an immobile aether. Lorentz' theory became the basis for much research in the next decade, and beyond. Its predictions for aberration are identical to those of the relativistic theory.&lt;ref name="whittaker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Special relativity===
{{See also|History of special relativity}}

Lorentz' theory matched experiment well, but it was complicated and made many unsubstantiated physical assumptions about the microscopic nature of electromagnetic media. In his 1905 theory of special relativity, Albert Einstein reinterpreted the results of Lorentz' theory in a much simpler and more natural conceptual framework which disposed of the idea of an aether. His derivation is given [[Aberration_of_light#Relativistic_explanation|above]], and is now the accepted explanation. [[Robert S. Shankland]] reported some conversations with Einstein, in which Einstein emphasized the importance of aberration:&lt;ref name=shank&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Shankland, R. S.|title=Conversations with Albert Einstein|journal=American Journal of Physics|volume=31|issue=1|date=1963|pages=47–57|doi=10.1119/1.1969236|bibcode = 1963AmJPh..31...47S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|He continued to say the experimental results which had influenced him most were the observations of stellar aberration and [[Fizeau experiment|Fizeau’s measurements]] on the speed of light in moving water. “They were enough,” he said.}}

Other important motivations for Einstein's development of relativity were the [[moving magnet and conductor problem]] and (indirectly) the negative aether drift experiments, already mentioned by him in the introduction of his first relativity paper. Einstein wrote in a note in 1952:&lt;ref name="norton" /&gt;

{{Quote|My own thought was more indirectly influenced by the famous Michelson-Morley experiment. I learned of it through Lorentz’ path breaking investigation on the electrodynamics of moving bodies (1895), of which I knew before the establishment of the special theory of relativity. Lorentz’ basic assumption of a resting ether did not seem directly convincing to me, since it led to an [struck out: to me artificial appearing] interpretation of the Michelson-Morley experiment, which [struck out: did not convince me] seemed unnatural to me. My direct path to the sp. th. rel. was mainly determined by the conviction that the electromotive force induced in a conductor moving in a magnetic field is nothing other than an electric field. But the result of Fizeau’s experiment and the phenomenon of aberration also guided me.}}

While Einstein's result is the same as Bradley's original equation except for an extra factor of &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;, it should be emphasized that Bradley's result does not merely give the classical limit of the relativistic case, in the sense that it gives incorrect predictions even at low relative velocities. Bradley's explanation cannot account for situations such as the water telescope, nor for many other optical effects (such as interference) that might occur within the telescope. This is because in the Earth's frame it predicts that the direction of propagation of the light beam in the telescope is not normal to the wavefronts of the beam, in contradiction with [[Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism]]. It also does not preserve the speed of light c between frames. However, Bradley did correctly infer that the effect was due to relative velocities.

In his publications he dealt with historical and [[archaeology|archaeological]] matters.

==Biography==
Adolf Aharon Rosenzweig was born in [[Turdossin]], Hungary. He studied at the [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] at [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]], later at the [[Yeshiva]] of [[Pressburg]]. After graduation he went to [[Berlin]], where he studied [[philosophy]] and [[Oriental languages]] and [[literatures]] at the [[University of Berlin]], and [[theology]] at the [[Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judentums]]. Finally he earned his [[PhD]].

On October 20, 1874, he entered upon the rabbinate of [[Pasewalk]], [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]], whence he was called to [[Międzychód|Birnbaum]], [[Posen (region)|Posen]]. In 1879 he went to [[Teplitz]], [[Bohemia]], and in 1887 he accepted a rabbinate at the [[New Synagogue (Berlin)|New Synagogue]] (Neue Synagoge) in [[Oranienburger Straße]], Berlin, where he remained until his death in 1918. There he came to be known as an outstanding [[preacher]]. He was also a prolific author, writing on history and archaeology as well as religious subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12881-rosenzweig-adolf Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosenzweig died in 1918, at 68, and was buried in Berlin. On his [[gravestone]] was written: "The law of truth was in his mouth, and unrighteousness was not found in his lips" ([[Book of Malachi|Malachi]] [[s:Bible (American Standard)/Malachi#Chapter 2|2:6]]).

==Family==
Rosenzweig's son, Rabbi Dr. [[Arthur Rosenzweig]] (March 27, 1883, Teplitz – 1935, [[Prague]]), was a spiritual leader.

His daughter, Hedwig, married Rabbi [[Juda Bergmann]]&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish life in Germany: memoirs from three centuries'' / edited by [[Monika Richarz]]; translated by Stella P. Rosenfeld and Sidney Rosenfeld, Bloomington, Ind.: Indiana University Press, 1991, p. 168 (footnote: p. 173).&lt;/ref&gt; (1874–1956) – [[Jews in Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galician]]-born, studied in the Rabbinical Seminary in [[Vienna]]; rabbi in Berlin from 1908; emigrated to [[Mandate Palestine]] in 1933. They had 8 children. Their elder son, [[Ernst David Bergmann]] (October 18, 1903, Karlsruhe – 1975), was a [[professor]] of [[Organic Chemistry]] in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (1954–1975), and often considered the father of the [[Israeli nuclear program]]. His brother, [[Felix Bergmann|Felix Eliezer Bergmann]] (August 17, 1908, Frankfurt – 2002, Israel), raised in Berlin, PhD in chemistry and MD from the [[University of Berlin]] in 1933; chair of [[Pharmacology]] in the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] (1950–2002). Arthur Bergmann (born 1908) was a lawyer who defended Palestinian prisoners and initiated several humanitarian projects for blind Palestinian children. Theodor Bergmann (born March 7, 1916, in Berlin) is a professor of Agricultural Economy in the [[University of Hohenheim]] in [[Stuttgart]] since 1981.
[[Alfred Bergmann]] [[:de:Alfred Bergmann (KPD-O)]](born 1910) was a member of the German communist opposition (KPD-O) like his younger brothers Theodor and Josef. Alfred was forced to emigrate to Switzerland from where he was handed over to the German Gestapo in 1942 and murdered in prison. [[Josef Bergmann]] [[:de:Josef Bergmann (Gewerkschafter)]](born 1913), also a member of the German communist opposition, emigrated with his brother Theodor to Sweden and returned to Germany after WW II.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47026">'''Aquatic locomotion''' is biologically [[propulsion|propelled motion]] through a [[liquid]] medium.  The simplest propulsive systems are composed of [[cilia]] and [[flagella]]. Swimming has evolved a number of times in a range of organisms including [[arthropod]]s,  [[fish]], [[mollusc]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[bird]]s, and [[mammal]]s.

==Evolution of swimming==
Swimming evolved a number of times in unrelated lineages.  Supposed jellyfish fossils occur in the [[Ediacaran]], but the first free-swimming animals appear in the Early to Middle [[Cambrian]].  These are mostly related to the [[arthropod]]s, and include the [[Anomalocaridid]]s, which swam by means of lateral lobes in a fashion reminiscent of today's [[cuttlefish]].  Cephalopods joined the ranks of the [[nekton]] in the late Cambrian,&lt;ref name='Kroger2009'&gt;{{cite journal| last2 = Yun-bai| first1 = B.| first2 = Y.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many terrestrial animals retain some capacity to swim, however some have returned to the water and developed the capacities for aquatic locomotion. Most [[apes]] (including humans), however, lost the swimming [[instinct]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://carta.anthropogeny.org/moca/topics/behavior-water |title=Behavior In Water|publisher=[[Center for Academic Research and Training in Anthropogeny]]| accessdate =2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Pedro Renato Bender, a research fellow at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]]'s Institute for Human Evolution, proposed a theory to explain the loss of that instinct. Termed the Saci last common ancestor hypothesis (after [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|Saci]], a Brazilian folklore character who cannot cross water barriers), it holds that the loss of instinctive swimming ability in apes is best explained as a consequence of constraints related to the adaptation to an arboreal life in the [[last common ancestor]] of apes.&lt;ref name="bender"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/16924/Dissertation%20Convergence%20Bender%203%20August%202014.pdf?sequence=4&amp;isAllowed=y|title=The use of convergence as a tool in the reconstruction of human past, with special focus on water use in hominin evolution|publisher=WIReDSpace (Wits Institutional Repository on DSpace)| accessdate =2 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bender hypothesized that the ancestral ape increasingly avoided deep-water bodies when the risks of being exposed to water were clearly higher than the advantages of crossing them.&lt;ref name="bender"/&gt; A decreasing contact with water bodies then could have led to the disaappearance of the [[doggy paddle]] instinct.&lt;ref name="bender"/&gt;

===Ciliates===
[[Ciliates]] use small flagella called [[cilia]] to move through the water. One ciliate will generally have hundreds to thousands of cilia that are densely packed together in arrays. During movement, an individual cilium deforms using a high-friction power stroke followed by a low-friction recovery stroke. Since there are multiple cilia packed together on an individual organism, they display collective behavior in a [[metachronal rhythm]]. This means the deformation of one cilium is in phase with the deformation of its neighbor, causing deformation waves that propagate along the surface of the organism. These propagating waves of cilia are what allow the organism to use the cilia in a coordinated manner to move. A typical example of a ciliated microorganism is the ''[[Paramecium]]'', a one-celled, ciliated protozoan covered by thousands of cilia. The cilia beating together allow the ''Paramecium'' to propel through the water at speeds of 500 micrometers per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauga|first=Eric|author2=Thomas R Powers|title=The hydrodynamics of swimming microorganisms|journal=Reports on Progress in Physics|date=25 August 2009|volume=72|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flagellates===
Certain organisms such as [[bacteria]] and animal sperm have [[flagellum]] which have developed a way to move in liquid environments. A rotary motor model shows that bacteria uses the protons of an [[electrochemical gradient]] in order to move their flagella. [[Torque]] in the flagella of bacteria is created by particles that conduct protons around the base of the flagellum. The direction of rotation of the flagella in bacteria comes from the occupancy of the proton channels along the perimeter of the flagellar motor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Brady, Richard M. |title= Torque and switching in the bacterial flagellar motor. An electrostatic model|journal= Biophysical Journal |volume= 64 |issue= 4| year = 1993 | pages = 961–973|bibcode = 1993BpJ....64..961B |doi = 10.1016/S0006-3495(93)81462-0 |pmid= 7684268|pmc= 1262414}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movement of sperm is called [[sperm motility]]. The middle of the mammalian spermatozoon contains mitochondria that power the movement of the flagellum of the sperm. The motor around the base produces torque, just like in bacteria for movement through the aqueous environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author = Mortimer, Sharon T.|title= A critical review of the physiological importance and analysis of sperm movement in mammals |journal= Human Reproduction Update | volume= 3 |issue= 5 | year = 1997 | pages = 403–439 | doi=10.1093/humupd/3.5.403}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudopodia===
Movement using a pseudopod is accomplished through increases in pressure at one point on the [[cell membrane]].  This pressure increase is the result of [[actin]] polymerization between the cortex and the membrane.  As the pressure increases the [[cell membrane]] is pushed outward creating the pseudopod.  When the pseudopod moves outward, the rest of the body is pulled forward by cortical tension.  The result is cell movement through the [[fluid]] medium.  Furthermore, the direction of movement is determined by [[chemotaxis]].  When chemoattraction occurs in a particular area of the [[cell membrane]], [[actin]] polymerization can begin and move the cell in that direction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=M. P.

[[File:Penaeus diagram pleopods.png|thumb|right|[[Shrimp]] paddle with special swimming legs ([[pleopods]])]]
[[File:Daphnia pulex.png|thumb|right|[[Daphnia]] swims by beating its antennae]]

Among the [[radiata]], jellyfish and their kin, the main form of swimming is to flex their cup shaped bodies. All [[jellyfish]] are free-swimming, although many of these spend most of their time swimming passively.  Passive swimming is akin to gliding;  the organism floats, using currents where it can, and does not exert any energy into controlling its position or motion.  Active swimming, in contrast, involves the expenditure of energy to travel to a desired location.

In [[bilateria]], there are many methods of swimming. The [[arrow worm]]s ([[chaetognatha]]) undulate their finned bodies, not unlike fish. [[Nematode]]s swim by undulating their fin-less bodies. Some [[Arthropod]] groups can swim - including many [[crustacean]]s. Most crustaceans, such as [[shrimp]], will usually swim by paddling with special swimming legs ([[pleopods]]). [[Swimming crab]]s swim with modified walking legs ([[pereiopod]]s). [[Daphnia]], a crustacean, swims by beating its antennae instead.

There are also a number of forms of swimming [[mollusc]]s.  Many free-swimming [[sea slug]]s, such as [[sea angel]]s, flap fin-like structures. Some shelled molluscs, such as [[scallop]]s can briefly swim by clapping their two shells open and closed. The molluscs most evolved for swimming are the [[cephalopod]]s.

Among the [[Deuterostomia]], there are a number of swimmers as well. [[Feather star]]s can swim by undulating their many arms [http://video.mx.msn.com/watch/video/beautiful-swimming-feather-star/8dw7iajz]. [[Salp]]s move by pumping waters through their gelatinous bodies. The deuterosomes most evolved for swimming are found among the [[vertebrate]]s, notably the [[fish]].

===Jet propulsion{{anchor|Jet Propulsion}}===

{{main|Jet propulsion}}

[[Jet propulsion]] is a method of aquatic locomotion where animals fill a muscular cavity and squirt out water to propel them in the opposite direction of the squirting water. Most organisms are equipped with one of two designs for jet propulsion; they can draw water from the rear and expel it from the rear, such as jellyfish, or draw water from front and expel it from the rear, such as salps. Filling up the cavity causes an increase in both the mass and drag of the animal. Because of the expanse of the contracting cavity, the animal's velocity fluctuates as it moves through the water, accelerating while expelling water and decelerating while vacuuming water. Even though these fluctuations in drag and mass can be ignored if the frequency of the jet-propulsion cycles is high enough, jet-propulsion is a relatively inefficient method of aquatic locomotion.

All [[cephalopod]]s can move by [[jet propulsion]], but this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish.&lt;ref name="mollusca12-11"/&gt; The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases. Since the Paleozoic, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity.&lt;ref name="mollusca12"&gt;{{The Mollusca|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stop-start motion provided by the jets, however, continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed - not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators.&lt;ref name="mollusca12"/&gt; Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name=Cephalopods&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0-19-852761-9|author1=Marion Nixon |author2=J.Z. Young |author2link=John Zachary Young |year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|title=The brains and lives of cephalopods}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|Preface}} and they can out accelerate most fish.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990&gt;{{cite book|title=Squid as Experimental Animals|author=Daniel L.

|isbn = 978-0-306-43513-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oxygenated water is taken into the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle cavity]] to the [[gill]]s and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the [[hyponome]], created by a fold in the mantle. Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece, &amp; Mitchell, p.612&lt;/ref&gt; Most cephalopods float (i.e. are [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]]), so do not need to swim to remain afloat.&lt;ref name="mollusca12-11"&gt;{{The Mollusca|chapter=11: Evolution of Buoyancy and Locomotion in recent cephalopods|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Squid]] swim more slowly than fish, but use more power to generate their speed. The loss in efficiency is due to the amount of water the squid can accelerate out of its mantle cavity.&lt;ref name="Levinton"&gt;Levinton, Jeffrey S. Marine Biology: Function, Biodiversity, Ecology. 3rd ed. New York, New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jellyfish]] use a one-way water cavity design which generates a phase of continuous cycles of jet-propulsion followed by a rest phase. The Froude efficiency is about 0.09, which indicates a very costly method of locomotion. The metabolic cost of transport for jellyfish is high when compared to a fish of equal mass.

Other jet-propelled animals have similar problems in efficiency. [[Scallop]]s, which use a similar design to jellyfish, swim by quickly opening and closing their shells, which draws in water and expels it from all sides. This locomotion is used as a means to escape predators such as [[starfish]]. Afterwards, the shell acts as a [[hydrofoil]] to counteract the scallop's tendency to sink. The Froude efficiency is low for this type of movement, about 0.3, which is why it's used as an emergency escape mechanism from predators. However, the amount of work the scallop has to do is mitigated by the elastic hinge that connects the two shells of the bivalve. Squids swim by drawing water into their mantle cavity and expelling it through their siphon. The Froude efficiency of their jet-propulsion system is around 0.29, which is much lower than a fish of the same mass.

Much of the work done by scallop muscles to close its shell is stored as elastic energy in abductin tissue, which acts as a spring to open the shell. The elasticity causes the work done against the water to be low because of the large openings the water has to enter and the small openings the water has to leave. The inertial work of scallop jet-propulsion is also low. Because of the low inertial work, the energy savings created by the elastic tissue is so small that it's negligible. Medusae can also use their elastic mesoglea to enlarge their bell. Their mantle contains a layer of muscle sandwiched between elastic fibers. The muscle fibers run around the bell circumferentially while the elastic fibers run through the muscle and along the sides of the bell to prevent lengthening. After making a single contraction, the bell vibrates passively at the resonant frequency to refill the bell. However, in contrast with scallops, the inertial work is similar to the hydrodynamic work due to how medusas expel water - through a large opening at low velocity. Because of this, the negative pressure created by the vibrating cavity is lower than the positive pressure of the jet, meaning that inertial work of the mantle is small. Thus, jet-propulsion is shown as an inefficient swimming technique.&lt;ref name="Levinton"/&gt;

==Fish==
[[File:Bluefin-big.jpg|thumb|right|[[Epipelagic fish|Open water fish]], like this [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]], are usually streamlined for straightline speed, with a deeply forked tail and a smooth body shaped like a spindle tapered at both ends.]]
[[File:Holacanthus ciliaris 1.jpg|thumb|right|Many reef fish, like this [[queen angelfish]], have a body flattened like a pancake, with pectoral and pelvic fins that act with the flattened body to maximize manoeuvrability.]]
{{See also|Fish locomotion}}

Many [[fish]] swim through water by creating [[Undulatory locomotion|undulations]] with their bodies or oscillating their [[Fish fin|fins]]. The undulations create components of forward thrust complemented by a rearward force, side forces which are wasted portions of energy, and a normal force that is between the forward thrust and side force. Different fish swim by undulating different parts of their bodies. Eel-shaped fish undulate their entire body in rhythmic sequences. Streamlined fish, such as salmon, undulate the caudal portions of their bodies. Some fish, such as sharks, use stiff, strong fins to create dynamic lift and propel themselves. It is common for fish to use more than one form of propulsion, although they will display one dominant mode of swimming &lt;ref name="Alexander"&gt;McNeill Alexander, R. Exploring Biomechanics: Animals in Motion. 2nd ed. New York, New York: W. H. Freeman &amp; Co, 1992. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gait changes have even been observed in juvenile reef fish of various sizes. Depending on their needs, fish can rapidly alternate between synchronized fin beats and alternating fin beats.&lt;ref name="Hale et al"&gt;Hale, Melina, R. Day, D. Thorsen, M. Westneat. 2006. Pectoral fin coordination and gait transitions in steadily swimming juvenile reef fishes. The Journal of Experimental Biology (209): 3708-3718.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[Guinness World Records]] 2009'', ''[[Hippocampus zosterae]]'' (the dwarf seahorse) is the slowest moving fish, with a top speed of about {{convert|5|ft|cm}} per hour.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guinness Book of World Records]] (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; They swim very poorly, rapidly fluttering a [[dorsal fin]] and using [[pectoral fin]]s (located behind their eyes) to steer. Seahorses have no [[caudal fin]].

===Body-caudal fin (BCF) propulsion===
*Anguilliform: Anguilliform swimmers are typically slow swimmers. They undulate the majority of their body and use their head as the fulcrum for the load they are moving. At any point during their undulation, their body has an amplitude between 0.5-1.0 wavelengths. The amplitude that they move their body through allows them to swim backwards.   Anguilliform locomotion is usually seen in fish with long, slender bodies like [[eels]], [[lampreys]], [[oarfish]], and a number of [[catfish]] species.
*Subcarangiform, Carangiform, Thunniform: These swimmers undulate the posterior half of their body and are much faster than anguilliform swimmers. At any point while they are swimming, a wavelength &lt;1  can be seen in the undulation pattern of the body. Some Carangiform swimmers include nurse sharks, bamboo sharks, and reef sharks. Thunniform swimmers are very fast and some common Thunniform swimmers include tuna, white sharks, salmon, jacks, and mako sharks{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}. Thunniform swimmers only undulate their high [[aspect ratio]] caudal fin, so they are usually very stiff to push more water out of the way.
*Ostraciiform: Ostraciiform swimmers oscillate their caudal region, making them relatively slow swimmers.  Boxfish, torpedo rays, and momyrs employ Ostraciiform locomotion. The cow fish uses Osctraciiform locomotion to hover in the water column.&lt;ref name="Sfakiotakis et al"&gt;Sfakiotakis, Michael, D. Lane, B. Davies. 1999. Review of Fish Swimming Modes for Aquatic Locomotion. Journal of Oceanic Engineering (24:2) 237-252.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Median paired fin (MPF) propulsion===
*Tetraodoniform, Balistiform, Diodontiform: These swimmers oscillate their median fins. They are typically slow swimmers, and some notable examples include the [[oceanic sunfish]] (which has extremely modified anal and dorsal fins), puffer fish, and triggerfish.
*Rajiform, Amiiform, Gymnotiform: This locomotory mode is accomplished by undulation of the pectoral and median fins. During their undulation pattern, a wavelength &gt;1 can be seen in their fins. They are typically slow to moderate swimmers, and some examples include rays, bowfin, and knife fishes. The [[black ghost knife fish]] is a Gymnotiform swimmer that has a very long ventral ribbon fin. Thrust is produced by passing waves down the ribbon fin while the body remains rigid. This also allows the ghost knife fish to swim in reverse.
*Labriform: Labriform swimmers are also slow swimmers. They oscillate their pectoral fins to create thrust. Oscillating fins create thrust when a starting vortex is shed from the trailing edge of the fin. As the foil departs from the starting vortex, the effect of that vortex diminishes, while the bound circulation remains, producing lift. Labriform swimming can be viewed as continuously starting and stopping. [[Wrasses]] and surf perch are common Labriform swimmers.&lt;ref name="Sfakiotakis et al" /&gt;

===Hydrofoils===
[[File:Triakis semifasciata monterey.jpg|thumb|right|The [[leopard shark]] angles its [[pectoral fin]]s so they behave as hydrofoils to control the animal's [[Flight dynamics|pitch]]]]

[[Hydrofoils]], or [[fin]]s, are used to push against the water to create a normal force to provide thrust, propelling the animal through water. Sea turtles and penguins beat their paired hydrofoils to create lift. Some paired fins, such as pectoral fins on leopard sharks, can be angled at varying degrees to allow the animal to rise, fall, or maintain its level in the water column. The reduction of fin surface area helps to minimize drag, and therefore increase efficiency. Regardless of size of the animal, at any particular speed, maximum possible lift is proportional to (wing area) x (speed)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Dolphins and whales have large, horizontal caudal hydrofoils, while many fish and sharks have vertical caudal hydrofoils. Porpoising (seen in cetaceans, penguins, and pinnipeds) may save energy if they are moving fast. Since drag increases with speed, the work required to swim unit distance is greater at higher speeds, but the work needed to jump unit distance is independent of speed. Seals propel themselves through the water with their caudal tail, while sea lions create thrust solely with their pectoral flippers.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

===Drag powered swimming===
[[File:Hippocampus.jpg|thumb|140px|right|The slowest-moving fishes are the [[sea horse]]s, often found in [[Coral reef fish|reefs]]]]

As with moving through any fluid, friction is created when molecules of the fluid collide with organism. The collision causes drag against moving fish, which is why many fish are streamlined in shape. Streamlined shapes work to reduce drag by orienting elongated objects parallel to the force of drag, therefore allowing the current to pass over and taper off the end of the fish. This streamlined shape allows for more efficient use of energy locomotion. Some flat-shaped fish can take advantage of pressure drag by having a flat bottom surface and curved top surface. The pressure drag created allows for the upward lift of the fish.&lt;ref name="Alexander" /&gt;

Appendages of aquatic organisms propel them in two main and biomechanically extreme mechanisms. Some use lift powered swimming, which can be compared to flying as appendages flap like wings, and reduce drag on the surface of the appendage. Others use drag powered swimming, which can be compared to oars rowing a boat, with movement in a horizontal plane, or paddling, with movement in the parasagittal plane.

Drag swimmers use a cyclic motion where they push water back in a power stroke, and return their limb forward in the return or recovery stroke. When they push water directly backwards, this moves their body forward, but as they return their limbs to the starting position, they push water forward, which will thus pull them back to some degree, and so opposes the direction that the body is heading. This opposing force is called [[drag (physics)|drag]]. The return-stroke drag causes drag swimmers to employ different strategies than lift swimmers. Reducing drag on the return stroke is essential for optimizing efficiency. For example, ducks paddle through the water spreading the webs of their feet as they move water back, and then when they return their feet to the front they pull their webs together to reduce the subsequent pull of water forward. The legs of water beetles have little hairs which spread out to catch up and move water back in the power stroke, but lay flat as the appendage moves forward in the return stroke. Also, the water beetle's legs have a side that is wider and is held perpendicular to the motion when pushing backward, but the leg is then rotated when the limb is to return forward, so that the thinner side will catch up less water.&lt;ref name="Lauder"&gt;Lauder, G., and Jayne, B. Pectoral fin Locomotion in Fishes: Testing Drag-Based Models Using Three-Dimensional Kinematics. Oxford Journals. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drag swimmers experience a lessened efficiency in swimming due to resistance which affects their optimum speed. The less drag a fish experiences, the more it will be able to maintain higher speeds. Morphology of the fish can be designed to reduce drag, such as streamlining the body. The cost of transport is much higher for the drag swimmer, and when deviating from its optimum speed, the drag swimmer is energetically strained much more than the lift swimmer. There are natural processes in place to optimize energy use, and it is thought that adjustments of metabolic rates can compensate in part for mechanical disadvantages.&lt;ref name="Ohlberger"&gt;Ohlberger, J., G. Staaks, and F. Hoker. Swimming efficiency and the influence of morphology on swimming costs in fishes. J Comp Physiol B. 176: 17-25. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Semi-aquatic animals compared to fully aquatic animals exhibit exacerbation of drag. Design that allows them to function out of the water limits the efficiency possible to be reached when in the water. In water swimming at the surface exposes them to resistive wave drag and is associated with a higher cost than submerged swimming.  Swimming below the surface exposes them to resistance due to return strokes and pressure, but primarily friction. Frictional drag is due to fluid viscosity and morphology characteristics. Pressure drag is due to the difference of water flow around the body and is also affected by body morphology.  Semi-aquatic organisms encounter increased resistive forces when in or out of the water, as they are not specialized for either habitat. The morphology of otters and beavers, for example, must meet needs for both environments. Their fur decreases streamlining and creates additional drag. The platypus may be a good example of an intermediate between drag and lift swimmers because it has been shown to have a rowing mechanism which is similar to lift-based pectoral oscillation. The limbs of semi-aquatic organisms are reserved for use on land and using them in water not only increases the cost of locomotion, but limits them to drag-based modes.&lt;ref name="Fish"&gt;Fish, Frank E. Biomechanics and Energetics in Aquatic and Semiaquatic Mammals: Platypus to Whale. Chicago Journals. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
Although they are less efficient, drag swimmers are able to produce more thrust at low speeds than lift swimmers. They are also thought to be better for maneuverability due to the large thrust produced.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker, J., and M. Westneat. Mechanical Performance of aquatic  rowing and flying. The Royal Society. 10.1098. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amphibians==
[[File:Frog žába.gif|thumb|Common toad (''Bufo bufo'') swimming]]
Most of the Amphibia have a larval state, which has inherited anguilliform motion, and a laterally compressed tail to go with it, from fish ancestors.
The corresponding tetrapod adult forms, even in the tail-retaining sub-class [[Urodeles]], are sometimes aquatic to only a negligible extent (as in the genus
[[Salamandra]], whose tail has lost its suitability for aquatic propulsion), but the majority of [[Urodeles]], from the newts to the giant salamander Megalobatrachus,
retain a laterally compressed tail for a life that is aquatic to a considerable degree, which can use in a carangiform motion.&lt;ref name="Lighthill "&gt;Lighthill , MJ. Hydromechanics of Aquatic Animal Propulsion- Annu. Rev. Fluid. Mech. - 1969 1-413-446.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the tailless [[amphibians]] (the [[frogs]] and [[toads]] of the sub-class [[Anura (frog)|Anura]]) the majority are aquatic to an insignificant extent in adult life, but in that considerable minority that are mainly aquatic we encounter for the first time the problem of adapting the tailless-tetrapod structure for aquatic propulsion. The mode that they use is unrelated to any used by fish. With their flexible back legs and webbed feet they execute something close to the leg movements of a human 'breast stroke,' rather more efficiently because the legs are better streamlined.&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

==Reptiles==
[[File:CrocoLoco-swimming-01.jpg|thumb|Nile crocodile (''[[Crocodylus niloticus]]'') swimming]]
From the point of view of aquatic propulsion, the descent of modern members of the class [[Reptilia]] from archaic tailed [[Amphibia]] is most obvious in the case of the order [[Crocodilia]] ([[crocodiles]] and [[alligators]]), which use their deep, laterally compressed tails in an essentially carangiform mode of propulsion (see [[Fish locomotion#Carangiform]]).&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

Terrestrial [[snakes]], in spite of their 'bad' hydromechanical shape with roughly circular cross-section and gradual posterior taper, swim fairly readily when required, by an anguilliform propulsion (see [[Fish locomotion#Anguilliform]]).&lt;ref name="Lighthill "/&gt;

[[Cheloniidae]] (true [[turtles]]) have found a beautiful solution to the problem of [[tetrapod]] swimming through the development of their forelimbs into flippers of high-aspect-ratio wing shape, with which they imitate a bird's propulsive mode more accurately than do the eagle-rays themselves.

==Fin and flipper locomotion==
{{main|Fin and flipper locomotion}}
[[File:Otariidae Phocidae Comparative Anatomy.svg|thumb|Comparative skeletal anatomy of a typical otariid seal and a typical phocid seal]]
Aquatic reptiles such as [[sea turtles]] and extinct species like [[Pliosauroids]] predominantly use their pectoral flippers to propel themselves through the water and their pelvic flippers for maneuvering. During swimming they move their pectoral flippers in a [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorso-ventral motion]], causing forward motion. During swimming, they rotate their front flippers to decrease drag through the water column and increase efficiency. Newly hatched sea turtles exhibit several behavioral skills that help orientate themselves towards the ocean as well as identifying the transition from sand to water. If rotated in the pitch, yaw or roll direction, the hatchlings are capable of counteracting the forces acting upon them by correcting with either their pectoral or pelvic flippers and redirecting themselves towards the open ocean.

Among mammals [[otariids]] ([[fur seals]]) swim primarily with their front flippers, using the rear flippers for steering, and [[phocids]] ([[true seals]]) move the rear flippers laterally, pushing the animal through the water.

==Escape reactions==
[[File:Caridoid escape reaction.gif|200px|thumb|Animated representation of [[caridoid escape reaction|lobstering]]|left]]

Some arthropods, such as [[lobster]]s and [[shrimp]]s, can propel themselves backwards quickly by flicking their tail, known as lobstering or the [[caridoid escape reaction]].

Varieties of fish, such as teleosts, also use fast-starts to escape from predators. Fast-starts are characterized by the muscle contraction on one side of the fish twisting the fish into a C-shape. Afterwards, muscle contraction occurs on the opposite side to allow the fish to enter into a steady swimming state with waves of undulation traveling alongside the body. The power of the bending motion comes from fast-twitch muscle fibers located in the central region of the fish. The signal to perform this contraction comes from a set of [[Mauthner cells]] which simultaneously send a signal to the muscles on one side of the fish.&lt;ref name="James"&gt;Wakeling, James M. and Ian A. Johnston. "Body bending during fast-starts in fish can be explain in terms of muscle torque and hydrodynamic resistance." The Journal of Experimental Biology 202.6 (1999): 675-682.&lt;/ref&gt; Mauthner cells are activated when something startles the fish and can be activated by visual&lt;ref name="Eaton"&gt;Eaton, Robert C. et al. "The Mauthner-initiated startle response in teleost fish." F. exp. Biol. 66 (1977): 65-81.&lt;/ref&gt; or sound-based stimuli.

Fast-starts are split up into three stages. Stage one, which is called the preparatory stroke, is characterized by the initial bending to a C-shape with small delay caused by hydrodynamic resistance. Stage two, the propulsive stroke, involves the body bending rapidly to the other side, which may occur multiple times. Stage three, the rest phase, cause the fish to return to normal steady-state swimming and the body undulations begin to cease. Large muscles located closer to the central portion of the fish are stronger and generate more force than the muscles in the tail. This asymmetry in muscle composition causes body undulations that occur in Stage 3. Once the fast-start is completed, the position of the fish has been shown to have a certain level of unpredictability, which helps fish survive against predators.&lt;ref name="Eaton" /&gt;

The rate at which the body can bend is limited by resistance contained in the inertia of each body part. However, this inertia assists the fish in creating propulsion as a result of the momentum created against the water. The forward propulsion created from C-starts, and steady-state swimming in general, is a result of the body of the fish pushing against the water. Waves of undulation create rearward momentum against the water providing the forward thrust required to push the fish forward.&lt;ref name="Wakeling"&gt;Wakeling, J.M. "Biomechanics of fast-start swimming in fish." Comparative Biochemistry and Physiology Part A.131 (2001): 31-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficiency==
{{See also|Froude number}}

The Froude propulsion efficiency is defined as the ratio of power output to the power input:

{{math|''nf'' {{=}} 2''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / (''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''U''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)}}

where U1 = free stream velocity and U2 = jet velocity. A good efficiency for carangiform propulsion is between 50 and 80%.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

===Minimizing drag===
Pressure differences occur outside the boundary layer of swimming organisms due to disrupted flow around the body.  The difference on the up- and down-stream surfaces of the body is pressure [[drag (physics)|drag]], which creates a downstream force on the object.  Frictional drag, on the other hand, is a result of fluid viscosity in the [[boundary layer]].  Higher [[turbulence]] causes greater frictional drag.&lt;ref name=Levinton/&gt;

[[Reynolds number]] (Re) is the measure of the relationships between inertial and viscous forces in flow ((animal's length x animal's velocity)/kinematic viscosity of the fluid).  Turbulent flow can be found at higher Re values, where the boundary layer separates and creates a wake, and laminar flow can be found at lower Re values, when the boundary layer separation is delayed, reducing wake and kinetic energy loss to opposing water momentum.&lt;ref name="Feldkamp"&gt;Feldkamp, S.D. "Swimming in the California sea lion: morphometrics, drag, and energetics." J. exp. Biol. 131, 117-135 (1987).&lt;/ref&gt;

The body shape of a swimming organism affects the resulting drag.  Long, slender bodies reduce pressure drag by streamlining, while short, round bodies reduce frictional drag; therefore, the optimal shape of an organism depends on its niche.  Swimming organisms with a fusiform shape are likely to experience the greatest reduction in both pressure and frictional drag.&lt;ref name=Feldkamp/&gt;

Wing shape also affects the amount of drag experienced by an organism, as with different methods of stroke, recovery of the pre-stroke position results in the accumulation of drag.

High-speed ram ventilation creates laminar flow of water from the gills along the body of an organism.

The secretion of mucus along the organism's body surface, or the addition of long-chained polymers to the velocity gradient, can reduce frictional drag experienced by the organism.

===Buoyancy===
Many aquatic/marine organisms have developed organs to compensate for their weight and control their [[buoyancy]] in the water.  These structures, make the density of their bodies very close to that of the surrounding water.  Some hydrozoans, such as siphonophores, has gas-filled floats; the Nautilus, Sepia, and Spirula ([[Cephalopods]]) have chambers of gas within their shells; and most [[teleost]] fish and many [[lantern fish]] (Myctophidae) are equipped with [[swim bladders]].  Many aquatic and marine organisms may also be composed of low-density materials.  Deep-water teleosts, which do not have a swim bladder, have few lipids and proteins, deeply ossified bones, and watery tissues that maintain their buoyancy.  Some [[sharks]]' livers are composed of low-density lipids, such as hydrocarbon [[squalene]] or [[wax esters]] (also found in Myctophidae without swim bladders), which provide buoyancy.&lt;ref name=Alexander /&gt;

Swimming animals that are denser than water must generate lift or adapt a [[benthic]] lifestyle.  Movement of the fish to generate hydrodynamic lift is necessary to prevent sinking.  Often, their bodies act as [[hydrofoils]], a task that is more effective in flat-bodied fish.  At a small tilt angle, the lift is greater for flat fish than it is for fish with narrow bodies.  Narrow-bodied fish use their fins as hydrofoils while their bodies remain horizontal.  In sharks, the [[heterocercal]] tail shape drives water downward, creating a counteracting upward force while thrusting the shark forward.  The lift generated is assisted by the pectoral fins and upward-angle body positioning.  It is supposed that [[tunas]] primarily use their pectoral fins for lift.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

Buoyancy maintenance is metabolically expensive.  Growing and sustaining a buoyancy organ, adjusting the composition of biological makeup, and exerting physical strain to stay in motion demands large amounts of energy.  It is proposed that lift may be physically generated at a lower energy cost by swimming upward and gliding downward, in a "climb and glide" motion, rather than constant swimming on a plane.&lt;ref name=Alexander/&gt;

===Temperature===
Temperature can also greatly affect the ability of aquatic organisms to move through water.  This is because temperature not only affects the properties of the water, but also the organisms in the water, as most have an ideal range specific to their body and metabolic needs.

[[Q10 (temperature coefficient)]], the factor by which a rate increases at a 10&amp;nbsp;°C increase in temperature, is used to measure how organisms' performance relies on temperature.  Most have increased rates as water becomes warmer, but some have limits to this and others find ways to alter such effects, such as by endothermy or earlier recruitment of faster muscle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marcinek|first=David J.|author2=Susanna B. Blackwell|author3=Heidi Dewar|author4=Ellen V. Freund|author5=Charles Farwell|author6=Daniel Dau|author7=Andrew C. Seitz|author8=Barbara A.

For example, ''Crocodylus porosus'', or estuarine crocodiles, were found to increase swimming speed from 15&amp;nbsp;°C to 23&amp;nbsp;°C and then to have peak swimming speed from 23&amp;nbsp;°C to 33&amp;nbsp;°C.  However, performance began to decline as temperature rose beyond that point, showing a limit to the range of temperatures at which this species could ideally perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elsworth|first=Peter G.|author2=Frank Seebacher|author3=Craig E.

===Submergence===
The more of the animal's body that is submerged while swimming, the less energy it uses. Swimming on the surface requires two to three times more energy than when completely submerged. This is because of the bow wave that is formed at the front when the animal is pushing the surface of the water when swimming, creating extra drag.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zj395mz_GYkC&amp;pg=PA150 Nature's Flyers: Birds, Insects, and the Biomechanics of Flight]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secondary evolution==
[[File:penguinu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Chinstrap penguin]] leaping over water]]
[[File:Swimming dog bgiu.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dog paddle|Swimming dog]]]]

While [[tetrapod]]s lost many of their natural adaptations to swimming when they evolved onto the land, many have re-evolved the ability to swim or have indeed returned to a completely aquatic lifestyle.

Primarily or exclusively aquatic animals have re-evolved from terrestrial tetrapods multiple times: examples include [[amphibians]] such as [[newts]], [[reptiles]] such as [[crocodile]]s, [[sea turtle]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaurs]] and [[mosasaur]]s, [[marine mammal]]s such as [[cetaceans|whales]], [[Pinniped|seals]] and [[otter]]s, and [[bird]]s such as [[penguin]]s. Many species of [[snakes]] are also aquatic and live their entire lives in the water. Among invertebrates, a number of [[insect]] species have adaptations for aquatic life and locomotion. Examples of [[aquatic insect]]s include [[dragonfly]] larvae, [[Corixidae|water boatmen]], and [[Dytiscidae|diving beetle]]s. There are also [[Diving bell spider|aquatic spiders]], although they tend to prefer other modes of locomotion under water than swimming proper.

Even though primarily terrestrial tetrapods have lost many of their adaptations to swimming, the ability to swim has been preserved or re-developed in many of them. It may never have been completely lost.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Examples are: Some breeds of [[dog]] swim recreationally. Umbra, a world record-holding dog, can swim 4 miles (6.4&amp;nbsp;km) in 73 minutes, placing her in the top 25% in human long-distance swimming competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sdogv.com/swim.html SWIMMING DOG VIDEOS Swimming Background&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although most [[cat]]s hate water, adult cats are good swimmers. The [[fishing cat]] is one wild species of cat that has evolved special adaptations for an aquatic or semi-aquatic lifestyle – webbed digits. Tigers and some individual jaguars are the only big cats known to go into water readily, though other big cats, including lions, have been observed swimming.  A few domestic cat breeds also like swimming, such as the [[Turkish Van]].

[[Horses]], [[moose]], and [[elk]] are very powerful swimmers, and can travel long distances in the water. [[Elephants]] are also capable of swimming, even in deep waters. Eyewitnesses have confirmed that [[camel]]s, including [[dromedary]] and [[Bactrian camel|Bactrian]] camels, can swim,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/mailbag/mcamelswim.html The Straight Dope Mailbag: The Straight Dope Mailbag: Is the camel the only animal that can't swim?]&lt;/ref&gt; despite the fact that there is little deep water in their natural habitats.

Both domestic and wild [[rabbit]]s can swim. Domestic rabbits are sometimes trained to swim as a circus attraction. A wild rabbit famously swam in [[Jimmy Carter rabbit incident|an apparent attack]] on U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]'s boat when it was threatened in its natural habitat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsoftheodd.com/article1021.html News of the Odd - Jimmy Carter Attacked by Killer Rabbit (April 20, 1979)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[guinea pig]] (or cavy) is noted as having an excellent swimming ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Harkness|first= John E.|last2= Wagner|first2= Joseph E.|title= The Biology and Medicine of Rabbits and Rodents|publisher= Williams &amp; Wilkins|year= 1995|pages= 30–39|isbn= 978-0-683-03919-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mice]] can swim quite well. They do panic when placed in water, but many lab mice are used in the [[Morris water maze]], a test to measure learning. When mice swim, they use their tails like [[flagella]] and kick with their legs.

Many snakes are excellent swimmers as well. Large adult [[anaconda]]s spend the majority of their time in the water, and have difficulty moving on land.

Many [[monkeys]] can naturally swim and some, like the [[proboscis monkey]], [[crab-eating macaque]], and [[rhesus macaque]] swim regularly.

==Human swimming==
{{Main|Human swimming|History of swimming}}
Swimming has been known amongst humans since prehistoric times; the earliest record of swimming dates back to [[Stone Age]] paintings from around 7,000 years ago.  Competitive swimming started in [[Europe]] around 1800 and was part of the first modern [[1896 Summer Olympics]] in [[Athens]], though not in a form comparable to the contemporary events.  It was not until 1908 that regulations were implemented by the [[FINA|International Swimming Federation]] to produce [[Swimming (sport)|competitive swimming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kehm | first = G | title = Olympic Swimming and Diving:Great Moments in Olympic History | pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=U2Kr_xFY2eUC&amp;pg=PA14 14] | publisher = The Rosen Publishing Group | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-1-4042-0970-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10917">An '''asset management plan''' ('''AMP''') is a tactical plan for managing an organisation's [[infrastructure]] and other assets to deliver an agreed standard of service. Typically, an asset management plan will cover more than a single asset, taking a system approach - especially where a number of assets are co-dependent and are required to work together to deliver an agreed standard of service.

The International Infrastructure Management Manual&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nams.org.nz/International%20Infrastructure%20Management%20Manual International Infrastructure Management Manual] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014032855/http://www.nams.org.nz/International%20Infrastructure%20Management%20Manual |date=October 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; defines an asset management plan as; "a plan developed for the management of one or more infrastructure assets that combines multi-disciplinary management techniques (including technical and financial) over the life cycle of the asset in the most cost effective manner to provide a specific level of service."

==Objectives==
Twofold: justification and optimization
* Justification - to give visibility of the costs and benefits associated with providing the agreed standard of service.
* Optimisation - to minimize the whole-life cost, including the operation, maintenance and replacement or disposal of each asset in the system.

Clearly for either of the above to work, the Standard of Service needs to be defined (in a measurable way) for each asset in an asset system.

The first part can be achieved relatively quickly, and is necessary before the decentralization of decision-making around maintenance and replacement can really occur, but the second requires ongoing work in local teams, together with better guidance from the center.

An asset management plan should take a "horses for courses" approach - not a one size fits all, but needs based - taking into account the basic information required. Beyond this, it should be built upon by the local asset manager according to local needs. A fully developed Asset Management approach usually  requires a number of iterations of the AMP, and needs to be reviewed more frequently for more complex systems, especially asset systems where the average annual cost required to provide the agreed standard of service is high.

==Typical contents==
An AMP typically covers the following areas:

# Asset System Description
# Standard of Service Definition
# Current Asset Performance
# Planned Actions
# Costs
# Benefits
# Potential Improvements

===Asset system description===
Description of the problem that the asset system aims to reduce. What assets are currently employed to address the problem?
Essentially, why do these assets exist? What would occur if these assets didn't exist. Identify dependencies between different parts of the asset system.
This is important to understand why the assets are there in the first place.

===Standard of service definition===
How should the above assets be performing and to what condition?
Define the Standard of Service (SoS) for the various parts of the asset system or group (a simple performance specification). Describe how the system, as a whole, is intended to perform in a measurable way. Usually consists of two parts, a measurable performance specification, and a minimum condition grade (CG).

The minimum CG should take account of the potential consequences of failure i.e. a flood defence protecting an urban area that would flood to a depth of 1m should the wall fail under design conditions should have a higher minimum CG (2 or 3). An earth embankment that is only protecting agricultural land, where the consequences of failure are significantly less will likely have a lower minimum CG (4 or 5)

If further refinement is necessary, the minimum condition grade should also take into account the likely failure mechanism - if failure of an asset is likely to occur very slowly and can be monitored, then a minimum condition of 2 or 3 is unlikely to be required - a minimum of CG4 can probably be justified. Conversely an asset that is liable to a fast failure mode with little warning will likely require a higher minimum condition.

Example Standards of Service for Flood Risk Management Assets:

A. Walls: 5.2m high until [[chainage]] 540m where the height drops to 5.1m.
The condition of the walls will be maintained to CG3 or better (due to urban area)

B. Culverts: under 3 carriageways, total of 120 m length (40 m each) provide conveyance for 30 m³/s without surcharging.
The condition of the culverts will be maintained to CG4 or better (under a rural road with alternative routings)

C. Pump station: provides capacity of 12 m³/s to drain the catchment during periods of tide-lock (usually every high-tide, for a period of 4 hours.)
The condition of the pump station will be maintained to CG2 or better (no redundancy)

D. Weir: provides a minimum water-level of 3.6 m to the watercourse above
The condition of the weir will be maintained to CG5 or better (minimal consequences of failure)

For some assets, there may be a legal obligation to maintain and operate the asset to a certain SoS.

This is important to understand what function the assets were designed to perform, and what minimum condition is considered acceptable.

===Current asset performance===
What condition are the assets currently in?
List/inventory and condition of all "assets" within the system, with their unique identifiers. This could include information such as asset owner, age, estimate of remaining life etc.
This is important to understand what state the assets are currently in.

===Planned actions and lifecycle management===
A short narrative explaining the near-term actions required to bridge the gap between where we are, and where we want to be. In the case where we are already at or above the agreed SoS, this section explains how we will continue to do so for the least cost - enabling an innovative approach to providing the agreed SoS.

This is important to understand what actions are planned to bring or keep the assets above their minimum condition, and able to perform their intended function.

===Costs===
What are the short, medium and longer-term costs for the asset system? A forward looking cost-profile for operating, maintaining, refurbishing and replacing to sustain the Standard of Service. Ideally the cost-profile will extend to cover the life of the longest-lived asset in the system, so as to estimate the whole-life cost, and make it possible to determine the average annual costs.

This section may need to be revisited and updated annually, and may form the basis for an annual bid for funding.

The numbers provided for the in-year (year 0) and the next three years (1 - 3), should be fairly accurate. Beyond that, estimates of costs to as to enable planning for any large expenditure items expected in the medium-term and to allow sufficient time to do a more in depth appraisal for an asset system that may require a change to the Standard of Service. Alternative management regimes should be considered to optimise the cost of providing the SoS. Where assumptions have been made, the basis for these should be provided.

This is important to understand what the planned actions are going to cost, as well as the ongoing "management" and overheads directly related to this particular asset system. Also essential from a local perspective, is optimizing the approach to providing the SoS.

===Benefits===
Why do we want to sustain the agreed standard of service of the assets in this asset system?
Without exception, assets should provide some measure of benefits that can be measured or explained. This will usually involve the translation of the standard of service into a monetary figure. Other benefits may be social or environmental, which may be difficult to quantify in monetary or quantitative terms, but some attempt to record all the relevant benefits is important, and more qualitative means may be employed.

===Improvements===
Potential improvements to the Standard of Service:
The standard of service currently delivered may be improved by acquisition, enhancement or other means. An "improvement" may also include the potential to reduce the standard of service, and potentially even dispose or divest of an asset or assets in an asset system.

These improvements represents a potential change to the standard of service and is typically managed as a project, complete with some form of appraisal of the additional expenditure, comparing different options and selecting a preferred options based on whatever decision process is appropriate.

The development and justification of a change project is outside the scope of an asset management plan.

*outlines the local government's goals, strategies and policies for managing the local government's assets and infrastructure, during the period covered by the plan; and

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7469">'''Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia'''  is a [[learned society]] founded in 1947 at the [[University of Virginia]], [[Charlottesville]] to promote interest in books and manuscripts, maps, printing, the graphic arts, and bibliography and textual criticism.  The society sponsors exhibitions, contests for student book collectors and Virginia printers, an international speakers’ series, and an active publications program which has produced over 175 separate publication in addition to its journal ''Studies in Bibliography''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsuva.org/wordpress/about/history/ Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia, "History"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The society was led for many years by [[Fredson Bowers]], a University of Virginia faculty member, and was influential in applying and spreading the theories of [[textual criticism]] developed by Bowers and [[W. W. Greg]] which brought about changes in the study of manuscripts and the printing of books to ascertain the original intentions of authors. 

==History==
After several years of preparation, on February 26, 1947 a group met in the University of Virginia library in Charlottesville and adopted a constitution that declared the object of their new society to be "to foster an interest in books (including books in manuscript), maps, printing, and bibliography." The group called "The Bibliographical Society of the University of Virginia." The inaugural address was given by Fredson Bowers, a member of the faculty, speaking on "Some Problems and Practices in Bibliographical Descriptions of Modern Authors," The leadership in the early years fell to Bowers, to John Cook Wyllie, and to Linton Massey. Bowers served as President in the Society's second and third years, 1948 and 1949, and then from its fifth year, 1951, up to 1974.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 4-8]}} By the late 1960s, the Society had nearly 1,000 members. {{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 70]}} Irby Cauthen, a charter member, became President in 1978. He was succeeded in 1993 by  [[G. Thomas Tanselle]], who was elected a Council member and President in 1993, only the second Council member from outside Charlottesville. Tanselle served as president of the society 1993-2006.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 76]}}

==''Studies in Bibliography'' and other publications==
''The Papers of the Bibliographical Society'' of the University of Virginia was started in 1948 as an annual journal dedicated to the study of books as physical objects and to textual criticism and scholarly editing; Bowers served as the journal's editor until his death in 1991.{{sfnb|Tanselle|2009}}  It was renamed ''Studies in Bibliography'' for volume 2.{{sfnb|Vander Meulen|1997|p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.01.02;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.01;brand=default 59-60, 67]}} Bowers conceived of the journal as one that encompassed all bibliographical study, with no restriction as to the geographical origins or periods or genres of the material examined. The topics of articles in Volume I (1948-1949), for instance, ranged from an unpublished manuscript by Thomas Jefferson, Elizabethan drama, and the use of watermarks as bibliographical evidence to catalogs issued by 16th century booksellers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv001.xml Papers Volume I] &lt;/ref&gt; Volume III (1950) opened with four major essays on textual matters: R. C. Bald's "Editorial Problems--A Preliminary Survey," W. W. Greg's "The Rationale of Copy-Text," Bowers's "Some Relations of Bibliography to Editorial Problems," and Archibald A. Hill's "Some Postulates for Distributional Study of Texts." &lt;ref&gt;[http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv003.xml Papers Volume III] &lt;/ref&gt; G. Thomas Tanselle called Greg's article "one of the most seminal papers in the history of English scholarship." 
{{sfnb|Tanselle|1997| p = [http://xtf.lib.virginia.edu/xtf/view?docId=StudiesInBiblio/uvaBook/tei/sibv050.xml;chunk.id=vol050.03;toc.depth=1;toc.id=vol050.03;brand=default 142]}} Articles in later issues also discussed new technology, such as the [[Hinman collator]], which used lenses and mirrors to compare copies of a printed work in order to show the differences. Bowers promoted this technique for early printed works, such as the [[First Folio]]s of Shakespeare.

Book length publications range from bibliographies of contemporary authors such as [[Peter Matthew Hillsman Taylor|Peter Taylor]] and [[Hilda Doolittle]] (H.D.), to studies of Shakespearean promptbooks, with an especially large number of works on the problems and theory of textual editing, including collections of essays by Bowers and Tanselle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bsuva.org/wordpress/publications-2/publications/ Print Publications]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, editorship of ''Studies in Bibliography'' passed to David L. Vander Meulen, a professor of English at the University of Virginia.{{sfnb|Tanselle|2009}}

[[File:Carl Spitzweg 021.jpg|thumb|upright|[[The Bookworm (painting)|''The Bookworm'']], 1850, by [[Carl Spitzweg]]]]

'''Bibliophilia''' or '''bibliophilism''' is the love of books, and a '''bibliophile''' or '''bookworm''' is an individual who loves and frequently reads books, though bookworm is normally used pejoratively.

==Profile==
The classic bibliophile is one who loves to read, admire and collect books, often amassing a large and specialized collection. Bibliophiles usually possess books they love or that hold special value as well as old editions with unusual bindings, [[autograph]]ed, and/or illustrated copies.&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=ABC for Book Collectors|year=1952|url=http://www.ilab.org/download.php?object=documentation&amp;id=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage of the term==
Bibliophilia is not to be confused with [[bibliomania]], a potential symptom of [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] involving the collecting of books to the extent that [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relations]] or health may be negatively affected, and in which the mere fact that a physical object is a book is sufficient for it to be collected or beloved. Some use the term "bibliomania" interchangeably with "bibliophily", and in fact, the [[Library of Congress]] does not use the term "bibliophily," but rather refers to its readers as either book collectors or bibliomaniacs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/index.html Library of Congress]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[The New York Public Library]] follows the same practice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catnyp.nypl.org/search/a?a New York Public library search]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to Arthur H. Minters, the "private collecting of books was a fashion indulged in by many [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], including [[Cicero]] and [[Titus Pomponius Atticus|Atticus]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=Collecting Books for Fun and Profit
|last=Minters
|first=Arthur H.
|location=New York
|publisher=Arco Publishing Inc.
|year=1979
|isbn=0-668-04598-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''bibliophile'' entered the [[English language]] in 1824.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bibliophile Merriam-Webster: bibliophile]&lt;/ref&gt; A bibliophile is to be distinguished from the much older notion of a bookman (which dates back to 1583), who is one who loves books, and especially [[Reading (process)|reading]]; more generally, a bookman is one who participates in writing, publishing, or selling books.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bookman Merriam-Webster: bookman]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Spencer, 2nd Earl Spencer|Lord Spencer]] and the [[George Spencer-Churchill, 5th Duke of Marlborough|Marquess of Blandford]] were noted bibliophiles. "The [[John Ker, 3rd Duke of Roxburghe|Roxburghe]] sale quickly became a foundational myth for the burgeoning secondhand book trade, and remains so to this day"; this sale is memorable due to the competition between "Lord Spencer and the marquis of Blandford [which] drove [the price of a probable first edition of Boccaccio's ''[[Decameron]]'' up to the astonishing and unprecedented sum of £2,260".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connell|first=Philip|title=Book Collecting: Cultural Politics, and the Rise of Literary Heritage in Romantic Britain|journal=Representations|year=2000|volume=71|pages=24–47|doi=10.1525/rep.2000.71.1.01p00764}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[J. P. Morgan]] was also a noted bibliophile. In 1884, he paid $24,750 for a 1459 edition of the [[Mainz Psalter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basbanes|first=Nicholas|authorlink=Nicholas A.

{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}
'''Computational complexity theory''' focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating these classes to each other. A computational problem is a task solved by a computer. A computation problem is solvable by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

A problem is regarded as inherently difficult if its solution requires significant resources, whatever the algorithm used. The theory formalizes this intuition, by introducing mathematical [[models of computation]] to study these problems and quantifying their [[computational complexity]], i.e., the amount of resources needed to solve them, such as time and storage. Other measures of complexity are also used, such as the amount of communication (used in [[communication complexity]]), the number of [[logic gate|gates]] in a circuit (used in [[circuit complexity]]) and the number of processors (used in [[parallel computing]]). One of the roles of computational complexity theory is to determine the practical limits on what computers can and cannot do. The [[P versus NP problem]], one of the seven [[Millenium Prize Problems]], is dedicated to the field of computational complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=P vs NP Problem {{!}} Clay Mathematics Institute |url=http://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem |website=www.claymath.org |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Closely related fields in theoretical computer science are [[analysis of algorithms]] and [[computability theory]]. A key distinction between analysis of algorithms and computational complexity theory is that the former is devoted to analyzing the amount of resources needed by a particular algorithm to solve a problem, whereas the latter asks a more general question about all possible algorithms that could be used to solve the same problem. More precisely, computational complexity theory tries to classify problems that can or cannot be solved with appropriately restricted resources. In turn, imposing restrictions on the available resources is what distinguishes computational complexity from computability theory: the latter theory asks what kind of problems can, in principle, be solved algorithmically.

==Computational problems==
[[Image:TSP Deutschland 3.png|thumb|333px|A traveling salesman tour through 14 German cities.]]

===Problem instances===
A [[computational problem]] can be viewed as an infinite collection of ''instances'' together with a ''solution'' for every instance. The input string for a computational problem is referred to as a problem instance, and should not be confused with the problem itself. In computational complexity theory, a problem refers to the abstract question to be solved. In contrast, an instance of this problem is a rather concrete utterance, which can serve as the input for a decision problem. For example, consider the problem of [[primality testing]]. The instance is a number (e.g., 15) and the solution is "yes" if the number is prime and "no" otherwise (in this case, 15 is not prime and the answer is "no"). Stated another way, the ''instance'' is a particular input to the problem, and the ''solution'' is the output corresponding to the given input.

To further highlight the difference between a problem and an instance, consider the following instance of the decision version of the [[traveling salesman problem]]: Is there a route of at most 2000 kilometres passing through all of Germany's 15 largest cities? The quantitative answer to this particular problem instance is of little use for solving other instances of the problem, such as asking for a round trip through all sites in [[Milan]] whose total length is at most 10&amp;nbsp;km. For this reason, complexity theory addresses computational problems and not particular problem instances.

===Representing problem instances===
When considering computational problems, a problem instance is a [[string (computer science)|string]] over an [[Alphabet (computer science)|alphabet]]. Usually, the alphabet is taken to be the binary alphabet (i.e., the set {0,1}), and thus the strings are [[bitstring]]s. As in a real-world [[computer]], mathematical objects other than bitstrings must be suitably encoded. For example, [[integer]]s can be represented in [[binary notation]], and [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s can be encoded directly via their [[adjacency matrix|adjacency matrices]], or by encoding their [[adjacency list]]s in binary.

Even though some proofs of complexity-theoretic theorems regularly assume some concrete choice of input encoding, one tries to keep the discussion abstract enough to be independent of the choice of encoding. This can be achieved by ensuring that different representations can be transformed into each other efficiently.

===Decision problems as formal languages===
[[Image:Decision Problem.svg|thumb|200px|A [[decision problem]] has only two possible outputs, ''yes'' or ''no'' (or alternately 1 or 0) on any input.]]
[[Decision problem]]s are one of the central objects of study in computational complexity theory. A decision problem is a special type of computational problem whose answer is either ''yes'' or ''no'', or alternately either 1 or 0. A decision problem can be viewed as a [[formal language]], where the members of the language are instances whose output is yes, and the non-members are those instances whose output is no. The objective is to decide, with the aid of an [[algorithm]], whether a given input string is a member of the formal language under consideration. If the algorithm deciding this problem returns the answer ''yes'', the algorithm is said to accept the input string, otherwise it is said to reject the input.

An example of a decision problem is the following. The input is an arbitrary [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]. The problem consists in deciding whether the given graph is [[connectivity (graph theory)|connected]], or not. The formal language associated with this decision problem is then the set of all connected graphs — to obtain a precise definition of this language, one has to decide how graphs are encoded as binary strings.

===Function problems===
A [[function problem]] is a computational problem where a single output (of a [[total function]]) is expected for every input, but the output is more complex than that of a [[decision problem]]—that is, the output isn't just yes or no. Notable examples include the [[traveling salesman problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]].

It is tempting to think that the notion of function problems is much richer than the notion of decision problems. However, this is not really the case, since function problems can be recast as decision problems. For example, the multiplication of two integers can be expressed as the set of triples (''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'') such that the relation ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''c'' holds. Deciding whether a given triple is a member of this set corresponds to solving the problem of multiplying two numbers.

===Measuring the size of an instance===
To measure the difficulty of solving a computational problem, one may wish to see how much time the best algorithm requires to solve the problem. However, the running time may, in general, depend on the instance. In particular, larger instances will require more time to solve. Thus the time required to solve a problem (or the space required, or any measure of complexity) is calculated as a function of the size of the instance. This is usually taken to be the size of the input in bits. Complexity theory is interested in how algorithms scale with an increase in the input size. For instance, in the problem of finding whether a graph is connected, how much more time does it take to solve a problem for a graph with 2''n'' vertices compared to the time taken for a graph with ''n'' vertices?

If the input size is ''n'', the time taken can be expressed as a function of ''n''. Since the time taken on different inputs of the same size can be different, the worst-case time complexity T(''n'') is defined to be the maximum time taken over all inputs of size ''n''. If T(''n'') is a polynomial in ''n'', then the algorithm is said to be a [[polynomial time]] algorithm. [[Cobham's thesis]] argues that a problem can be solved with a feasible amount of resources if it admits a polynomial time algorithm.

A Turing machine is a mathematical model of a general computing machine. It is a theoretical device that manipulates symbols contained on a strip of tape. Turing machines are not intended as a practical computing technology, but rather as a general model of a computing machine—anything from an advanced supercomputer to a mathematician with a pencil and paper. It is believed that if a problem can be solved by an algorithm, there exists a Turing machine that solves the problem. Indeed, this is the statement of the [[Church–Turing thesis]]. Furthermore, it is known that everything that can be computed on other models of computation known to us today, such as a [[RAM machine]], [[Conway's Game of Life]], [[cellular automata]] or any programming language can be computed on a Turing machine. Since Turing machines are easy to analyze mathematically, and are believed to be as powerful as any other model of computation, the Turing machine is the most commonly used model in complexity theory.

Many types of Turing machines are used to define complexity classes, such as [[deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s, [[non-deterministic Turing machine]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[symmetric Turing machine]]s and [[alternating Turing machine]]s. They are all equally powerful in principle, but when resources (such as time or space) are bounded, some of these may be more powerful than others.

A deterministic Turing machine is the most basic Turing machine, which uses a fixed set of rules to determine its future actions. A probabilistic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an extra supply of random bits. The ability to make probabilistic decisions often helps algorithms solve problems more efficiently. Algorithms that use random bits are called [[randomized algorithm]]s. A non-deterministic Turing machine is a deterministic Turing machine with an added feature of non-determinism, which allows a Turing machine to have multiple possible future actions from a given state. One way to view non-determinism is that the Turing machine branches into many possible computational paths at each step, and if it solves the problem in any of these branches, it is said to have solved the problem. Clearly, this model is not meant to be a physically realizable model, it is just a theoretically interesting abstract machine that gives rise to particularly interesting complexity classes. For examples, see [[non-deterministic algorithm]].

===Other machine models===
Many machine models different from the standard [[Turing machine equivalents#Multi-tape Turing machines|multi-tape Turing machines]] have been proposed in the literature, for example [[random access machine]]s. Perhaps surprisingly, each of these models can be converted to another without providing any extra computational power. The time and memory consumption of these alternate models may vary.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvnb|Arora|Barak|2009|loc=Chapter 1: The computational model and why it doesn't matter}}&lt;/ref&gt; What all these models have in common is that the machines operate [[deterministic algorithm|deterministically]].

However, some computational problems are easier to analyze in terms of more unusual resources. For example, a non-deterministic Turing machine is a computational model that is allowed to branch out to check many different possibilities at once. The non-deterministic Turing machine has very little to do with how we physically want to compute algorithms, but its branching exactly captures many of the mathematical models we want to analyze, so that [[non-deterministic time]] is a very important resource in analyzing computational problems.

===Complexity measures===
For a precise definition of what it means to solve a problem using a given amount of time and space, a computational model such as the [[deterministic Turing machine]] is used. The ''time required'' by a deterministic Turing machine ''M'' on input ''x'' is the total number of state transitions, or steps, the machine makes before it halts and outputs the answer ("yes" or "no"). A Turing machine ''M'' is said to operate within time ''f''(''n''), if the time required by ''M'' on each input of length ''n'' is at most ''f''(''n''). A decision problem ''A'' can be solved in time ''f''(''n'') if there exists a Turing machine operating in time ''f''(''n'') that solves the problem. Since complexity theory is interested in classifying problems based on their difficulty, one defines sets of problems based on some criteria. For instance, the set of problems solvable within time ''f''(''n'') on a deterministic Turing machine is then denoted by [[DTIME]](''f''(''n'')).

Analogous definitions can be made for space requirements. Although time and space are the most well-known complexity resources, any [[Complexity|complexity measure]] can be viewed as a computational resource. Complexity measures are very generally defined by the [[Blum complexity axioms]]. Other complexity measures used in complexity theory include [[communication complexity]], [[circuit complexity]], and [[decision tree complexity]].

The complexity of an algorithm is often expressed using [[big O notation]].

===Best, worst and average case complexity===
[[File:Sorting quicksort anim.gif|thumb|250px|Visualization of the [[quicksort]] [[algorithm]] that has [[Best, worst and average case|average case performance]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(n\log n)&lt;/math&gt;.]]
The [[best, worst and average case]] complexity refer to three different ways of measuring the time complexity (or any other complexity measure) of different inputs of the same size. Since some inputs of size ''n'' may be faster to solve than others, we define the following complexities:
#Best-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the best input of size ''n''.
#Average-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem on an average. This complexity is only defined with respect to a [[probability distribution]] over the inputs. For instance, if all inputs of the same size are assumed to be equally likely to appear, the average case complexity can be defined with respect to the uniform distribution over all inputs of size ''n''.
#[[Amortized analysis]]: Amortized analysis considers both the costly and less costly operations together over the whole series of operations of the algorithm.
#Worst-case complexity: This is the complexity of solving the problem for the worst input of size ''n''.
The order from cheap to costly is: Best, average (of [[discrete uniform distribution]]), amortized, worst.

For example, consider the deterministic sorting algorithm [[quicksort]]. This solves the problem of sorting a list of integers that is given as the input. The worst-case is when the input is sorted or sorted in reverse order, and the algorithm takes time [[Big O notation|O]](''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for this case. If we assume that all possible permutations of the input list are equally likely, the average time taken for sorting is O(''n'' log ''n''). The best case occurs when each pivoting divides the list in half, also needing O(''n'' log ''n'') time.

===Upper and lower bounds on the complexity of problems===
To classify the computation time (or similar resources, such as space consumption), one is interested in proving upper and lower bounds on the maximum amount of time required by the most efficient algorithm solving a given problem. The complexity of an algorithm is usually taken to be its worst-case complexity, unless specified otherwise. Analyzing a particular algorithm falls under the field of [[analysis of algorithms]]. To show an upper bound ''T''(''n'') on the time complexity of a problem, one needs to show only that there is a particular algorithm with running time at most ''T''(''n''). However, proving lower bounds is much more difficult, since lower bounds make a statement about all possible algorithms that solve a given problem. The phrase "all possible algorithms" includes not just the algorithms known today, but any algorithm that might be discovered in the future. To show a lower bound of ''T''(''n'') for a problem requires showing that no algorithm can have time complexity lower than ''T''(''n'').

Upper and lower bounds are usually stated using the [[big O notation]], which hides constant factors and smaller terms. This makes the bounds independent of the specific details of the computational model used. For instance, if ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;7''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;15''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;40, in big O notation one would write ''T''(''n'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;O(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

==Complexity classes==
{{main|Complexity class}}

===Defining complexity classes===
A '''complexity class''' is a set of problems of related complexity. Simpler complexity classes are defined by the following factors:
* The type of computational problem: The most commonly used problems are decision problems. However, complexity classes can be defined based on [[function problem]]s, [[counting problem (complexity)|counting problem]]s, [[optimization problem]]s, [[promise problem]]s, etc.
* The model of computation: The most common model of computation is the deterministic Turing machine, but many complexity classes are based on non-deterministic Turing machines, [[Boolean circuit]]s, [[quantum Turing machine]]s, [[monotone circuit]]s, etc.
* The resource (or resources) that are being bounded and the bounds: These two properties are usually stated together, such as "polynomial time", "logarithmic space", "constant depth", etc.

Some complexity classes have complicated definitions that do not fit into this framework. Thus, a typical complexity class has a definition like the following:

:The set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within time ''f''(''n''). (This complexity class is known as DTIME(''f''(''n'')).)

But bounding the computation time above by some concrete function ''f''(''n'') often yields complexity classes that depend on the chosen machine model. For instance, the language {''xx'' | ''x'' is any binary string} can be solved in [[linear time]] on a multi-tape Turing machine, but necessarily requires quadratic time in the model of single-tape Turing machines. If we allow polynomial variations in running time, [[Cobham's thesis|Cobham-Edmonds thesis]] states that "the time complexities in any two reasonable and general models of computation are polynomially related" {{Harv|Goldreich|2008|loc=Chapter 1.2}}. This forms the basis for the complexity class [[P (complexity)|P]], which is the set of decision problems solvable by a deterministic Turing machine within polynomial time. The corresponding set of function problems is [[FP (complexity)|FP]].

===Important complexity classes===

[[Image:Complexity subsets pspace.svg|250px|thumb|right|A representation of the relation among complexity classes]]
Many important complexity classes can be defined by bounding the time or space used by the algorithm. Some important complexity classes of decision problems defined in this manner are the following:

The logarithmic-space classes (necessarily) do not take into account the space needed to represent the problem.

It turns out that PSPACE = NPSPACE and EXPSPACE = NEXPSPACE by [[Savitch's theorem]].

Other important complexity classes include [[BPP (complexity)|BPP]], [[ZPP (complexity)|ZPP]] and [[RP (complexity)|RP]], which are defined using [[probabilistic Turing machine]]s; [[AC (complexity)|AC]] and [[NC (complexity)|NC]], which are defined using Boolean circuits; and [[BQP]] and [[QMA]], which are defined using quantum Turing machines. [[Sharp-P|#P]] is an important complexity class of counting problems (not decision problems). Classes like [[IP (complexity)|IP]] and [[AM (complexity)|AM]] are defined using [[Interactive proof system]]s. [[ALL (complexity)|ALL]] is the class of all decision problems.

===Hierarchy theorems===
{{main|time hierarchy theorem|space hierarchy theorem}}
For the complexity classes defined in this way, it is desirable to prove that relaxing the requirements on (say) computation time indeed defines a bigger set of problems. In particular, although DTIME(''n'') is contained in DTIME(''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), it would be interesting to know if the inclusion is strict. For time and space requirements, the answer to such questions is given by the time and space hierarchy theorems respectively. They are called hierarchy theorems because they induce a proper hierarchy on the classes defined by constraining the respective resources. Thus there are pairs of complexity classes such that one is properly included in the other. Having deduced such proper set inclusions, we can proceed to make quantitative statements about how much more additional time or space is needed in order to increase the number of problems that can be solved.

More precisely, the [[time hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DTIME}\big(f(n) \big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DTIME} \big(f(n) \sdot \log^{2}(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[space hierarchy theorem]] states that
:&lt;math&gt;\mathsf{DSPACE}\big(f(n)\big) \subsetneq \mathsf{DSPACE} \big(f(n) \sdot \log(f(n)) \big)&lt;/math&gt;.

The time and space hierarchy theorems form the basis for most separation results of complexity classes. For instance, the time hierarchy theorem tells us that P is strictly contained in EXPTIME, and the space hierarchy theorem tells us that L is strictly contained in PSPACE.

===Reduction===
{{main|Reduction (complexity)}}
Many complexity classes are defined using the concept of a reduction. A reduction is a transformation of one problem into another problem. It captures the informal notion of a problem being at most as difficult as another problem. For instance, if a problem ''X'' can be solved using an algorithm for ''Y'', ''X'' is no more difficult than ''Y'', and we say that ''X'' ''reduces'' to ''Y''. There are many different types of reductions, based on the method of reduction, such as Cook reductions, Karp reductions and Levin reductions, and the bound on the complexity of reductions, such as [[polynomial-time reduction]]s or [[log-space reduction]]s.

The most commonly used reduction is a polynomial-time reduction. This means that the reduction process takes polynomial time. For example, the problem of squaring an integer can be reduced to the problem of multiplying two integers. This means an algorithm for multiplying two integers can be used to square an integer. Indeed, this can be done by giving the same input to both inputs of the multiplication algorithm. Thus we see that squaring is not more difficult than multiplication, since squaring can be reduced to multiplication.

This motivates the concept of a problem being hard for a complexity class. A problem ''X'' is ''hard'' for a class of problems ''C'' if every problem in ''C'' can be reduced to ''X''. Thus no problem in ''C'' is harder than ''X'', since an algorithm for ''X'' allows us to solve any problem in ''C''. The notion of hard problems depends on the type of reduction being used. For complexity classes larger than P, polynomial-time reductions are commonly used. In particular, the set of problems that are hard for NP is the set of [[NP-hard]] problems.

If a problem ''X'' is in ''C'' and hard for ''C'', then ''X'' is said to be ''[[complete (complexity)|complete]]'' for ''C''. This means that ''X'' is the hardest problem in ''C''. (Since many problems could be equally hard, one might say that ''X'' is one of the hardest problems in ''C''.) Thus the class of [[NP-complete]] problems contains the most difficult problems in NP, in the sense that they are the ones most likely not to be in P. Because the problem P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP is not solved, being able to reduce a known NP-complete problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to another problem, Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, would indicate that there is no known polynomial-time solution for Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. This is because a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; would yield a polynomial-time solution to Π&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, because all NP problems can be reduced to the set, finding an [[NP-complete]] problem that can be solved in polynomial time would mean that P&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;NP.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"/&gt;

==Important open problems==
[[Image:Complexity classes.svg|thumb|250px|Diagram of complexity classes provided that P&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;NP. The existence of problems in NP outside both P and NP-complete in this case was established by Ladner.&lt;ref name="Ladner75"&gt;{{Citation|last=Ladner|first=Richard E.|title=On the structure of polynomial time reducibility|journal=[[Journal of the ACM]] |volume=22|year=1975|pages=151–171|doi=10.1145/321864.321877|issue=1|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

===P versus NP problem===
{{Main|P versus NP problem}}

The complexity class P is often seen as a mathematical abstraction modeling those computational tasks that admit an efficient algorithm. This hypothesis is called the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. The complexity class [[NP (complexity)|NP]], on the other hand, contains many problems that people would like to solve efficiently, but for which no efficient algorithm is known, such as the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]], the [[Hamiltonian path problem]] and the [[vertex cover problem]]. Since deterministic Turing machines are special non-deterministic Turing machines, it is easily observed that each problem in P is also member of the class NP.

The question of whether P equals NP is one of the most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide implications of a solution.&lt;ref name="Sipser2006"&gt;See {{harvnb|Sipser|2006|loc= Chapter 7: Time complexity}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions.

===Problems in NP not known to be in P or NP-complete===
It was shown by Ladner that if '''P''' ≠ '''NP''' then there exist problems in '''NP''' that are neither in '''P''' nor '''NP-complete'''.&lt;ref name="Ladner75" /&gt; Such problems are called [[NP-intermediate]] problems. The [[graph isomorphism problem]], the [[discrete logarithm problem]] and the [[integer factorization problem]] are examples of problems believed to be NP-intermediate. They are some of the very few NP problems not known to be in '''P''' or to be '''NP-complete'''.

The [[graph isomorphism problem]] is the computational problem of determining whether two finite [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s are [[graph isomorphism|isomorphic]]. An important unsolved problem in complexity theory is whether the graph isomorphism problem is in '''P''', '''NP-complete''', or NP-intermediate. The answer is not known, but it is believed that the problem is at least not NP-complete.&lt;ref name="AK06"&gt;{{Citation

The best algorithm for this problem, due to [[László Babai]] and [[Eugene Luks]] has run time &lt;math&gt;O(2^{\sqrt{n \log n}})&lt;/math&gt; for graphs with ''n'' vertices, although some recent work by Babai offers some potentially new perspectives on this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |last=Babai |first=László |date=2016 |title=Graph Isomorphism in Quasipolynomial Time |eprint=1512.03547 |class=cs.DS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[integer factorization problem]] is the computational problem of determining the [[prime factorization]] of a given integer. Phrased as a decision problem, it is the problem of deciding whether the input has a prime factor less than ''k''. No efficient integer factorization algorithm is known, and this fact forms the basis of several modern cryptographic systems, such as the [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] algorithm. The integer factorization problem is in '''NP''' and in '''co-NP''' (and even in UP and co-UP&lt;ref&gt;[[Lance Fortnow]]. Computational Complexity Blog: Complexity Class of the Week: Factoring. September 13, 2002. http://weblog.fortnow.com/2002/09/complexity-class-of-week-factoring.html&lt;/ref&gt;). If the problem is '''NP-complete''', the polynomial time hierarchy will collapse to its first level (i.e., '''NP''' will equal '''co-NP'''). The best known algorithm for integer factorization is the [[general number field sieve]], which takes time &lt;math&gt;O(e^{\left(\frac{64}{9}\right)^{1/3}(\log n)^{1/3}(\log \log n)^{2/3}})&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram MathWorld: [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/NumberFieldSieve.html Number Field Sieve]&lt;/ref&gt; to factor an integer ''n''. However, the best known [[quantum algorithm]] for this problem, [[Shor's algorithm]], does run in polynomial time. Unfortunately, this fact doesn't say much about where the problem lies with respect to non-quantum complexity classes.

===Separations between other complexity classes===
Many known complexity classes are suspected to be unequal, but this has not been proved. For instance '''P''' ⊆ '''NP''' ⊆ '''[[PP (complexity)|PP]]''' ⊆ '''PSPACE''', but it is possible that '''P''' = '''PSPACE'''. If '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', then '''P''' is not equal to '''PSPACE''' either. Since there are many known complexity classes between '''P''' and '''PSPACE''', such as '''RP''', '''BPP''', '''PP''', '''BQP''', '''MA''', '''PH''', etc., it is possible that all these complexity classes collapse to one class. Proving that any of these classes are unequal would be a major breakthrough in complexity theory.

Along the same lines, '''[[co-NP]]''' is the class containing the [[Complement (complexity)|complement]] problems (i.e. problems with the ''yes''/''no'' answers reversed) of '''NP''' problems. It is believed&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/ Boaz Barak's course on Computational Complexity] [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spr06/cos522/lec2.pdf Lecture 2]&lt;/ref&gt; that '''NP''' is not equal to '''co-NP'''; however, it has not yet been proven. It is clear that if these two complexity classes are not equal then '''P''' is not equal to '''NP''', since if '''P'''='''NP''' we would also have '''P'''='''co-NP''', since problems in '''NP''' are dual to those in '''co-NP'''.

Similarly, it is not known if '''L''' (the set of all problems that can be solved in logarithmic space) is strictly contained in '''P''' or equal to '''P'''. Again, there are many complexity classes between the two, such as '''NL''' and '''NC''', and it is not known if they are distinct or equal classes.

It is suspected that '''P''' and '''BPP''' are equal. However, it is currently open if '''BPP''' = '''NEXP'''.

A problem that can be solved in theory (e.g. given large but finite resources, especially time), but for which in practice ''any'' solution takes too many resources to be useful, is known as an '''{{visible anchor|intractable problem}}'''.&lt;ref&gt;Hopcroft, J.E., Motwani, R. and Ullman, J.D. (2007) [[Introduction to Automata Theory, Languages, and Computation]], Addison Wesley, Boston/San Francisco/New York (page 368)&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called a '''{{visible anchor|tractable problem}}''', literally "a problem that can be handled". The term ''[[wikt:infeasible|infeasible]]'' (literally "cannot be done") is sometimes used interchangeably with ''[[wikt:intractable|intractable]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Algorithms and Complexity |first=Gerard |last=Meurant |year=2014 |isbn=978-0-08093391-7 |page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=6WriBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=computational+feasibility+tractability p. 4]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though this risks confusion with a [[feasible solution]] in [[mathematical optimization]].&lt;ref&gt;

Tractable problems are frequently identified with problems that have polynomial-time solutions ('''P''', '''PTIME'''); this is known as the [[Cobham–Edmonds thesis]]. Problems that are known to be intractable in this sense include those that are [[EXPTIME]]-hard. If NP is not the same as P, then [[NP-hard]] problems are also intractable in this sense.

However, this identification is inexact: a polynomial-time solution with large exponent or large constant term grows quickly, and may be impractical for practical size problems; conversely, an exponential-time solution that grows slowly may be practical on realistic input, or a solution that takes a long time in the worst case may take a short time in most cases or the average case, and thus still be practical. Saying that a problem is not in P does not imply that all large cases of the problem are hard or even that most of them are. For example, the decision problem in [[Presburger arithmetic]] has been shown not to be in P, yet algorithms have been written that solve the problem in reasonable times in most cases. Similarly, algorithms can solve the NP-complete [[knapsack problem]] over a wide range of sizes in less than quadratic time and [[SAT solver]]s routinely handle large instances of the NP-complete [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].

To see why exponential-time algorithms are generally unusable in practice, consider a program that makes 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations before halting. For small ''n'', say 100, and assuming for the sake of example that the computer does 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; operations each second, the program would run for about 4&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years, which is the same order of magnitude as the [[age of the universe]]. Even with a much faster computer, the program would only be useful for very small instances and in that sense the intractability of a problem is somewhat independent of technological progress. However, an exponential-time algorithm that takes 1.0001&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; operations is practical until ''n'' gets relatively large.

Similarly, a polynomial time algorithm is not always practical. If its running time is, say, ''n''&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;, it is unreasonable to consider it efficient and it is still useless except on small instances. Indeed, in practice even ''n''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; algorithms are often impractical on realistic sizes of problems.

==History==
An early example of algorithm complexity analysis is the running time analysis of the [[Euclidean algorithm]] done by [[Gabriel Lamé]] in 1844.

Before the actual research explicitly devoted to the complexity of algorithmic problems started off, numerous foundations were laid out by various researchers. Most influential among these was the definition of Turing machines by [[Alan Turing]] in 1936, which turned out to be a very robust and flexible simplification of a computer.

The beginning of systematic studies in computational complexity is attributed to the seminal 1965 paper "On the Computational Complexity of Algorithms" by [[Juris Hartmanis]] and [[Richard E. Stearns]], which laid out the definitions of [[time complexity]] and [[space complexity]], and proved the hierarchy theorems.&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Fortnow|Homer|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in 1965 [[Jack Edmonds|Edmonds]] suggested to consider a "good" algorithm to be one with running time bounded by a polynomial of the input size.&lt;ref&gt;Richard M. Karp, "[http://cecas.clemson.edu/~shierd/Shier/MthSc816/turing-karp.pdf Combinatorics, Complexity, and Randomness]", 1985 Turing Award Lecture&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier papers studying problems solvable by Turing machines with specific bounded resources include&lt;ref name="Fortnow 2003"/&gt; [[John Myhill]]'s definition of [[linear bounded automata]] (Myhill 1960), [[Raymond Smullyan]]'s study of rudimentary sets (1961), as well as [[Hisao Yamada]]'s paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Yamada | first1 = H. | title = Real-Time Computation and Recursive Functions Not Real-Time Computable | journal = IEEE Transactions on Electronic Computers | volume = EC-11 | issue = 6 | pages = 753–760 | year = 1962 | doi = 10.1109/TEC.1962.5219459}}&lt;/ref&gt; on real-time computations (1962). Somewhat earlier, [[Boris Trakhtenbrot]] (1956), a pioneer in the field from the USSR, studied another specific complexity measure.&lt;ref&gt;Trakhtenbrot, B.A.: Signalizing functions and tabular operators. Uchionnye Zapiski
Penzenskogo Pedinstituta (Transactions of the Penza Pedagogoical Institute) 4, 75–87 (1956) (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt; As he remembers:

{{quote|However, [my] initial interest [in automata theory] was increasingly set aside in favor of computational complexity, an exciting fusion of combinatorial methods, inherited from [[switching theory]], with the conceptual arsenal of the theory of algorithms. These ideas had occurred to me earlier in 1955 when I coined the term "signalizing function", which is nowadays commonly known as "complexity measure".&lt;ref&gt;Boris Trakhtenbrot, "From Logic to Theoretical Computer Science – An Update". In: ''Pillars of Computer Science'', LNCS 4800, Springer 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1967, [[Manuel Blum]] formulated a set of [[axiom]]s (now known as [[Blum axioms]]) specifying desirable properties of complexity measures on the set of computable functions and proved an important result, the so-called [[Blum's speedup theorem|speed-up theorem]]. The field began to flourish in 1971 when the [[Stephen Cook]] and [[Leonid Levin]] [[Cook–Levin theorem|proved]] the existence of practically relevant problems that are [[NP-complete]]. In 1972, [[Richard Karp]] took this idea a leap forward with his landmark paper, "Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems", in which he showed that 21 diverse [[combinatorics|combinatorial]] and [[graph theory|graph theoretical]] problems, each infamous for its computational intractability, are NP-complete.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = Richard M. Karp | chapter = Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems | chapter-url = http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs172/karp.pdf | title = Complexity of Computer Computations | editor = R. E. Miller and J. W. Thatcher (editors) | publisher = New York: Plenum | pages = 85–103 | year = 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, much work was done on the average difficulty of solving NP-complete problems—both exactly and approximately. At that time, computational complexity theory was at its height, and it was widely believed that if a problem turned out to be NP-complete, then there was little chance of being able to work with the problem in a practical situation. However, it became increasingly clear that this is not always the case, and some authors claimed that general asymptotic results are often unimportant for typical problems arising in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=1143|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the DSM-IV-TR notes, "Fantasies, behaviors, or objects are paraphilic only when they lead to clinically significant distress or impairment (e.g. are obligatory, result in [[sexual dysfunction]], require participation of nonconsenting individuals, lead to legal complications, interfere with social relationships)".

Although there may be no connection between coprophilia and [[sadomasochism]] (SM), the limited data on the former comes from studies of the latter.  A study of 164 males in [[Finland]] from two SM clubs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=N. Kenneth Sandnabba |author2=Pekka Santtila |author3=Niklas Nordling |title=Sexual Behavior and Social Adaptation Among Sadomasochistically-Oriented Males |journal=Journal of Sex Research |date=August 1999 | doi = 10.1080/00224499909551997 |volume=36 |pages=273–282}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that 18.2% had engaged in coprophilia; 3% as a sadist, 6.1% as a masochist, and 9.1% as both. 18% of heterosexuals and 17% of homosexuals in the study pool had tried coprophilia, showing no statistically significant difference between heterosexuals and homosexuals. In a separate article analyzing 12 men who engaged in [[bestiality]], an additional analysis of an 11-man subgroup revealed that 6 had engaged in coprophilic behavior, compared with only 1 in the matched control group consisting of 12 SM-oriented males who did not engage in bestiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sandnabba N.K. |author2=Santtila P. |author3=Nordling N. |author4=Beetz A.M. |author5=Alison L. |title=Characteristics of a Sample of Sadomasochistically-oriented Males with Recent Experience of Sexual Contact with Animals |journal=Deviant Behavior |volume=23 |issue=6 |date=November 2002 |doi=10.1080/01639620290086503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Habitat ==
Sometimes referred to as the cryptozoic niche, the habitat allowing for cryptozoic life is characterized by a shielding of exterior light sources, with stable and cool temperature and high humidity. Forest humus and leaf litter can provide the necessary conditions for crytpozoic life in part because of the shielding from surrounding trees. Nonetheless, temperate woodlands are not the only ground for such a habitat: the tropics and the desert are often suitable for cryptozoa, such as [[scorpion]]s or [[Solifugae]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1403">The first idea of a digital administrative law was born in Italy in 1978 by Giovanni Duni and was developed in 1991 with the name [[teleadministration]] (look).
In the [[public administration]] [[debate]] about [[New Public Management]] (NPM), the concept of '''digital era governance''' (or '''DEG''') is claimed by [[Patrick Dunleavy]], [[Helen Margetts]] and their co-authors as replacing NPM since around 2000-05. DEG has three key elements: reintegration (bringing issues back into government control, like US airport security after 9/11); needs-based holism (reorganizing government around distinct client groups); and [[digitizing|digitization]] (fully exploiting the potential of digital storage and Internet communications to transform governance).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3779">In [[applied linguistics]], an '''error''' is a deviation from accepted rules of a language made by a learner of a second language. Such errors result from the learner's lack of knowledge of correct rules of the target language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellis |first= Rod |authorlink=Rod Ellis |title=The Study of Second Language Acquisition |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3KglibyrZ5sC&amp;pg=PA700 |accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford]] |isbn= 0-19-437189-1 |page=700}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant distinction is generally made between ''errors'' and ''mistakes'' which are not treated the same from a linguistic viewpoint. The study of learners' errors was the main area of investigation by linguists in the history of [[second-language acquisition]] research.&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, p.43&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==
[[H. Douglas Brown]] has defined linguistic errors as "a noticeable deviation from the adult grammar of a native speaker, reflecting the interlanguage competence of the learner." He cites an example ''Does John can sing?'' where a preceding ''do'' auxiliary verb has been used as an error.&lt;ref name=Brown205&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=H. Douglas |title=Principles of Language Learning and Teaching |url=|accessdate= |year=1994 |publisher=[[Prentice Hall Regents]] |location=[[New Jersey]] |isbn= 0-13-191966-0 |page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Difference between error and mistake==
In linguistics, it is considered important to distinguish errors from mistakes. A distinction is always made between errors and mistakes where the former is defined as resulting from a learner's lack of proper grammatical knowledge, whilst the latter as a failure to utilize a known system correctly.&lt;ref name=Brown205/&gt; Brown terms these mistakes as performance errors. Mistakes of this kind are frequently made by both native speakers and second language learners. However, native speakers are generally able to correct themselves quickly. Such mistakes include slips of the tongue and random ungrammatical formations. On the other hand, errors are systematic in that they occur repeatedly and are not recognizable by the learner. They are a part of the learner's interlanguage, and the learner does not generally consider them as errors. They are ''errors'' only from the perspective of teachers and others who are aware that the learner has deviated from a grammatical norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gass|first1= Susan M.|last2=Selinker |first2=Larry |title=Second Language Acquisition: An Introductory Course |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fhnbMj597-4C&amp;pg=PA102 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 0203932846|pages=102–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That is, mistakes can be self-corrected with or without being pointed out to the speaker but errors cannot be self-corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nika Purwati |title=Research in English and Applied Linguistics (REAL) Vol 2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcFge3z0sqkC&amp;pg=PA307 |publisher=Routledge |isbn= 6029126237|page=307|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance of error ==
S. Pit Corder was probably the first to point out and discuss the importance of errors learners make in course of their learning a second language. Soon after, the study and analysis of learners’ errors took a prominent place in applied linguistics. Brown suggests that the process of second language learning is not very different from learning a first language, and the feedback a L2 learner gets upon making errors benefits him in developing the L2 knowledge.&lt;ref name=Brown205/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4856">The '''floral axis''' (sometimes referred to as the [[Receptacle (botany)|receptacle]]) is the area of the flower upon which the reproductive organs and other ancillary organs are attached. It is also the point at the center of a floral diagram.many flower in angiosperm apear on floral axis. The floral axis can differ in form depending on the type of plant. For example, [[monocotyledon]]s have a weakly developed floral axis compared to [[dicotyledon]]s, and will therefore rarely possess a floral disc, which is common among dicotyledons.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783540136552|title=The Families of the Monocotyledons - Structure, Evolution, and Taxonomy {{!}} R.M.T.

[[Floral diagram]]ming is a method used to graphically describe a flower. In the context of floral diagramming, the floral axis represents the center point around which the diagram is oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Prenner|first=Gerhard|last2=Bateman|first2=Richard M.|last3=Rudall|first3=Paula J.|date=2010|title=Floral Formulae Updated for Routine Inclusion in Formal Taxonomic Descriptions|jstor=27757066|journal=Taxon|volume=59|issue=1|pages=241–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floral axis can also be referred to as the receptacle in floral diagrams or when describing the structure of the flower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaplan|first=Donald R.|date=1967-11-01|title=FLORAL MORPHOLOGY, ORGANOGENESIS AND INTERPRETATION OF THE INFERIOR OVARY IN DOWNINGIA BACIGALUPII|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=54|issue=10|pages=1274–1290|doi=10.1002/j.1537-2197.1967.tb10765.x|issn=1537-2197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main or mother axis in floral diagrams is not synonymous with the floral axis, rather it refers to where the stem of the flower is in relation to the diagram. The floral axis is also useful for identifying the type of symmetry that a flower exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Jesson LK, Barrett SC | title = The genetics of mirror-image flowers | journal = Proceedings: Biological Sciences | volume = 269 | issue = 1502 | pages = 1835–9 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12350272 | pmc = 1691103 | doi = 10.1098/rspb.2002.2068 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
The floral axis serves as the attachment point for organs of the flower, such as the reproductive organs (pistil and stamen) and other organs such as the sepals and carpels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/floral-axis|title=Floral axis {{!}} plant anatomy|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floral axis acts much like a [[Aerial stem modification|modified stem]] and births the organs that are attached to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCoy|first=Ralph W.|date=1940-10-01|title=FLORAL ORGANOGENESIS IN FRASERA CAROLINENSIS|journal=American Journal of Botany|language=en|volume=27|issue=8|pages=600–609|doi=10.1002/j.1537-2197.1940.tb10921.x|issn=1537-2197}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fusion of a plant's organs and the amount of organs that are developed from the floral axis largely depends on the determinateness of the floral axis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schaffner|first=John H.|date=1937|title=The Fundamental Nature of the Flower|jstor=2481128|journal=Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club|volume=64|issue=9|pages=569–582|doi=10.2307/2481128}}&lt;/ref&gt; The floral axis does perform different functions for different types of plants. For instance, with [[dicotyledon]]s, the floral axis acts as a nectary, while that is not the case with [[monocotyledon]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  More specialized functions can also be performed by the floral axis. For example, in the plant ''Hibiscus,'' the floral axis is able to proliferate and produce fruit, rendering processes like self pollination unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bergman|first=H.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3747">The '''[[fugacity]] capacity constant''' (Z) is used to help describe the concentration of a chemical in a system (usually in mol/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;Pa). Hemond and Hechner-Levy (2000) describe how to utilize the fugacity capacity to calculate the [[concentration]] of a [[chemical]] in a system. Depending on the chemical, fugacity capacity varies. The concentration in media 'm' equals the fugacity capacity in media 'm' multiplied by the fugacity of the chemical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chemical Fate and Transport in the Environment|first=Hemond HF |last=Fechner-Levy EJ|edition= Academic Press|year= 2000|isbn=0-12-340275-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For a chemical system at equilibrium, the fugacity of the chemical will be the same in each media/phase/compartment. Therefore equilibrium is sometimes called "equifugacity" in the context of these calculations.&lt;ref&gt;D. MacKay &amp; S. Paterson. 1991. Evaluating the Multimedia Fate of Organic Chemicals: a Level III Fugacity Model. Environmental Science and Technology. 25(3):427.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- [[Image:FC.JPG]] --&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C_m = Z_m \cdot f&lt;/math&gt;

where Z is a proporational constant, termed ''fugacity capacity''. This equation does not necessarily imply that C and f are always linearly related. Non-linearity can be accommodated by allowing Z to vary as a function of C or f.

For a better understanding of the fugacity capacity concept, [[heat capacity]] may provide a precedent for introducing Z as a capacity of a phase to absorb particular quantity of chemical. However, phases with high fugacity capacity do not necessarily retain high [[fugacity]].  

In calculations of fugacity capacity key factors would be (a) the nature of the solute (chemical), (b) the nature of the medium or compartment, (c) temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Multimedia environmental models|first=Donald |last=Mackay|edition= Lewis Publishers|year= 1991|isbn=0-87371-242-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expressions for Fugacity Capacity==
The expression for Z&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is dependent on the media/phase/compartment. The following list gives the fugacity capacities for common medias:&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKay. 2001. Multimedia Environmental Models: The Fugacity Approach, 2nd Ed. CRC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Air (under [[ideal gas]] assumptions): Z&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/RT
* Water: Z&lt;sub&gt;water&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/H
* Octanol: Z&lt;sub&gt;oct&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt;/H
* Pure Phase of Target Chemical: Z&lt;sub&gt;pure&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/P&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;v

Where: R is the [[Ideal gas constant]] (8.314 Pa*m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol*K); T is the absolute temperature (K); H is the [[Henry's law]] constant for the target chemical (Pa/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;mol); K&lt;sub&gt;ow&lt;/sub&gt; is the octanol-water [[partition coefficient]] for the target chemical (dimensionless ratio); P&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; is the vapor pressure of the target chemical (Pa); and v is the molar volume of the target chemical (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/mol). 

Notice that the ratio between Z-values for different media (e.g. octanol and water) is the same as the ratio between the concentrations of the target chemical in each media at equilibrium. 

When using a fugacity capacity approach to calculate the concentrations of a chemical in each of several medias/phases/compartments, it is often convenient to calculate the prevailing fugacity of the system using the following equation if the total mass of target chemical (M&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;) and the volume of each compartment (V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) are known:

:&lt;math&gt;f = M_T / \Sigma_m (V_m Z_m) &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, if the target chemical is present as a pure phase at equilibrium, its vapor pressure will be the prevailing fugacity of the system.

'''GRANK''', or '''Global Rank''' is a ranking of the rarity of a [[species]], and is a useful tool in determining conservation needs.
Global Ranks are derived from a [[consensus]] of various conservation data centres, natural heritage programmes, scientific experts and [[The Nature Conservancy]].

They are based on the total number of known, extant populations worldwide, and to what degree they are threatened by destruction.  Criteria also include securely protected populations, size of populations, and the ability of the species to persist.

* '''G1 — Extremely rare'''  Usually 5 or fewer occurrences in the overall range or very few remaining individuals; or because of some factor(s) making it especially vulnerable to extinction.
* '''G2 — Very rare'''  Usually between 5 and 20 occurrences in the overall range or with many individuals in fewer occurrences; or because of some factor(s) making it vulnerable to extinction.
* '''G3 — Rare to uncommon'''  Usually between 20 and 100 occurrences; may have fewer occurrences, but with a large number of individuals in some populations; may be susceptible to large-scale disturbances.
* '''G4 — Common'''  Usually more than 100 occurrences; usually not susceptible to immediate threats.
* '''G5 — Very common'''  Demonstrably secure under present conditions.
* '''GH — Historic'''  No records in the past 20 years.
* '''GU — Status uncertain'''  Often because of low search effort or cryptic nature of the species; more data needed.
* '''GX — Globally extinct'''  No recent records despite specific searches.
* '''?'''  Denotes inexact numeric rank (i.e. G4?).
* '''G '''  A "G" (or "T") followed by a blank space means that the conservation data centre has not yet obtained the Global Rank from The Nature Conservancy.
* '''G? — Unranked'''  Or, if following a ranking, rank tentatively assigned (e.g. G3?).
* '''Q'''  Denotes that the taxonomic status of the species, subspecies, or variety is questionable.
* '''T'''  Denotes that the rank applies to a subspecies or variety.

'''Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE)''' is a laboratory of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located in [[Bangalore]], its primary function is research and development of aero gas-turbines for military aircraft. As a spin-off effect, GTRE has been developing marine gas-turbines also.

==Products==
{{Refimprove section|date=September 2018}}
Principal achievements of Gas Turbine Research Establishment include:
* Design and development of India's "first centrifugal type 10kN thrust engine" between 1959-61.
* Design and development of a "1700K reheat system" for the Orpheus 703 engine to boost its power. The redesigned system was certified in 1973.
* Successful upgrade of the reheat system of the Orpheus 703 to 2000K.
* Improvement of the Orpheus 703 engine by replacing "the front subsonic compressor stage" with a "transonic compressor stage" to increase the "basic dry thrust " of the engine.
* Design and development of a "demonstrator" gas turbine engine—GTX 37-14U—for fighter aircraft. Performance trials commenced in 1977 and the "demonstrator phase" was completed in 1981. The GTX 37-14U was "configured" and "optimized" to build a "low by-pass ratio jet engine" for "multirole performance aircraft. This engine was dubbed GTX 37-14U B.

===GTX Kaveri===

[[GTRE GTX-35VS Kaveri|GTX-35VS Kaveri]] Engine was intended to power production models of [[HAL Tejas]].&lt;ref name="JAE2006"&gt;Gunston, Bill (Ed.) (June 15, 2006).  "GTRE Kaveri" in ''Jane’s Aero-Engines'', Issue 14.  Coulsdon, Surrey, UK:  Jane's Information Group Limited.  {{ISBN|0-7106-1405-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defending the program GTRE mentioned reasons for delay including:
* Non availability of state of the art wind tunnel facility in India
* The technology restrictions imposed by US by placing it in "entities" list

Both hurdles having been cleared, GTRE intended to continue work on the AMCA (future generation fighter craft).

This program was abandoned in 2014.

===Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine (KMGT)===

Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine is a design spin-off from the Kaveri engine, designed for Indian combat aircraft. Using the core of the Kaveri engine, GTRE added low-pressure compressor and turbine as a gas generator and designed a free power turbine to generate shaft power for maritime applications.&lt;ref name="GTRE develops engine for navy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEH20080717034427 |title=DRDO develops marine gas turbine engine for Indian Navy |publisher=Newindpress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28 }}{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The involvement of [[Indian Navy]] in the development and testing of the engine has given a tremendous boost to the programme

=== Ghatak ===
The Ghatak engine will be a 52-kilonewton dry variant of the Kaveri aerospace engine and will be used in the UCAV([[Unmanned combat aerial vehicle|Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicles]]). The Government of India has cleared a funding of INR 2650 Crores($ 394 Million) for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2015/12/14/project-ghatak-india-to-make-indigenous-stealth-combat-drones/|title=Project Ghatak: India to make indigenous stealth combat drones|last=Bazaar|first=The American|date=2015-12-14|website=The American Bazaar|access-date=2016-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
The KMGT was tested on the Marine Gas Turbine test bed, an [[Indian Navy]] facility at [[Vishakhapatnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frontierindia.net/demonstration-of-12-mw-kaveri-marine-gas-turbine-for-indian-navy |title=Demonstration of 12 MW Kaveri Marine Gas Turbine for Indian Navy &amp;#124; Frontier India - News, Analysis, Opinion |publisher=Frontier India |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2012-01-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318203428/http://frontierindia.net/demonstration-of-12-mw-kaveri-marine-gas-turbine-for-indian-navy |archivedate=2012-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The engine has been tested to its potential of 12 MW at ISA SL 35&amp;nbsp;°C condition, a requirement of the Navy to propel SNF class ships, such as the [[Rajput class destroyers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=40470 |title=Modified Kaveri Engine to Propel Indian Navy Ships |publisher=Pib.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8804">'''High dynamic range''' ('''HDR''') is a [[dynamic range]] higher than what is considered to be [[standard dynamic range]]. The term is often used in discussing [[display device]]s, [[photography]], [[3D rendering]], and [[sound recording]] including [[digital imaging]] and [[digital audio]] production. The term may apply to an [[analog signal|analog]] or [[Digital signal (signal processing)|digitized signal]], or to the means of recording, processing, and reproducing such signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Estimation-theoretic approach to dynamic range enhancement using multiple exposures |first1=Mark A. |last1=Robertson |first2=Sean |last2=Borman |first3=Robert L. |last3=Stevenson |journal=Journal of Electronic Imaging |volume=12 |issue=2 |page=220, right column, line 26219–228 |date=April 2003 |quote=The first report of digitally combining multiple pictures of the same scene to improve dynamic range appears to be Mann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Audio ==

[[XDR (audio)]] is used to provide higher-quality audio when using microphone sound systems or recording onto cassette tapes.

HDR Audio is a dynamic mixing technique used in [[EA Digital Illusions CE]] [[Frostbite Engine]] to allow relatively louder sounds to drown out softer sounds.

[[Dynamic range compression]] is a set of techniques used in audio recording and communication to put high-dynamic-range material through channels or media of lower dynamic range.  Optionally, dynamic range expansion is used to restore the original high dynamic range on playback.

==Radio==

In radio, high dynamic range is important especially when there are potentially interfering signals.  Measures such as [[spurious-free dynamic range]] are used to quantify the dynamic range of various system components such as frequency synthesizers.  HDR concepts are important in both conventional and [[software-defined radio]] design.

==Instrumentation==

In many fields, instruments need to have a very high dynamic range.  For example, in [[seismology]], HDR accelerometers are needed, as in the [[ICEARRAY#Instruments|ICEARRAY instruments]].

'''Identification''' is a key term for the discussion of [[rhetoric]] in [[Kenneth Burke]]′s ''[[A Rhetoric of Motives]]''. He uses it to evaluate the traditional perception of [[rhetoric]] as persuasion.  Burke suggests that whenever someone attempts to persuade someone else, [[Identification (psychology)|identification]] occurs, because for persuasion to occur, one party must "identify" with another. That is, the one who becomes persuaded sees that one party is like another in some way. Burke's definition of identification works not only in relation to the self (e.g. that tree has arms and is like me, thus I identify with that tree) it also refers to exterior identification (e.g. that man eats beef patties like that group, thus he is identified with that beef-patty-eating group). One can perceive identification between objects that are not the self.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Rhetoric of Motives|last=Burke|first=Kenneth|publisher=University of California Press|year=1969|isbn=0-520-01546-0|location=Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Rhetoric of Motives'' opens with an analysis of [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Samson Agonistes]]'' and [[Matthew Arnold]]'s ''[[Empedocles on Etna]]''; from his analysis, Burke eventually extricates the term “identification.”  From there, Burke uses the term to reclaim certain elements of rhetoric that have fallen away, while simultaneously expanding it to show how “identification” supplements traditional emphases on persuasion as central. The concept of identification, argues Burke, gives us an additional way of looking at rhetoric's role in [[human relations]], specifically ways in which people enact [[social cohesion]].

==Identification and the Realm of Rhetoric==

In particular, the concept of identification can expand our vision of the realm of rhetoric as more than solely agonistic. To be sure, that is the way we have traditionally situated it: “Rhetoric,” writes Burke, “is ''par excellence'' the region of the Scramble, of insult and injury, bickering, squabbling, malice and the lie, cloaked malice and the subsidized lie. . . . We begin with an anecdote of killing (in ''Samson Agonistes'' and “Empedocles on Etna”), because [[invective]], [[eristic]], [[polemic]], and [[logomachy]] are so pronounced an aspect of rhetoric” (19-20). But while impelled to acknowledge this nature, we can look for more from rhetoric, he argues:
: “We need never deny the presence of strife, enmity, factions, as a characteristic motive of rhetorical expression. We need not close our eyes to their almost tyranneous ubiquity in human relations; we can be on the alert always to see how such temptations to strife are implicit in the institutions that condition human relationships; yet we can at the same time always look beyond this order, to the principle of identification in general, a [[terministic]] choice justified by the facts that the identifications in the order of love are also characteristic of rhetorical expression.” (20)

==Facets of Identification==

What is identification? Burke spends most of the rest of Section I of ''A Rhetoric of Motives'' exploring the concept, at the same time hammering out the realm of rhetoric.

===Identification and Consubstantiality===

In identifying with the interests of another (or being persuaded that shared interests exist, even if they do not), one is “substantially one” with that other, or ''[[consubstantial.]]'' At the same time, each individual can retain unique substance. ''Substance,'' a recurring Burkean theme, was examined in terms of its “universal paradoxes” in ''[[Grammar of Motives]]'' and in its manifestations as unique constructed acts in ''[[Symbolic of Motives]];'' here, in the ''Rhetoric,'' substance is examined in its implications of division. To “identify with” is to become consubstantial, but, at the same time, as the ''Rhetoric'' shows us, “to begin with ‘identification’ is, by the same token, though roundabout, to confront the implications of division” (22).

It is in this key discussion of identification, [[consubstantiality]], and division that Burke lays out his crucial definition of the realm of rhetoric:
: “Insofar as the individual is involved in conflict with other individuals or groups, the study of this same individual would fall under the head of ''Rhetoric''. . . . The ''Rhetoric'' must lead us through the Scramble, the Wrangle of the Market Place, the flurries and flare-ups of the Human Barnyard, the Give and Take, the wavering line of pressure and counterpressure, the Logomachy, the onus of ownership, the War of Nerves, the War.” (23)

===Identification and Property===

In metaphysics, “a thing is identified by its ''properties”'' (23), but a rhetorical identification by property refers to material, economic property. Identification by material property is ethical, Burke states, but it is also the source of turmoil and discord when identifications establishing themselves through property come into relation with one another. The importance of property and the simultaneous, overlapping cooperation and conflict it entails make property and identification a key rhetorical topic, Burke says: “Put identification and division ambiguously together, so that you cannot know for certain just where one ends and the other begins, and you have the characteristic invitation to rhetoric. . . . The wavering line between the two cannot be ‘scientifically’ identified; rival rhetoricians can draw it at different places, and their persuasiveness varies with the resources each has at hand” (25).

In this section, Burke also notes the way identification functions as a screen, placing the term again firmly within the realm of rhetoric. Using science as an example, Burke explains that “however ‘pure’ one’s motives may be actually, the impurities of identification lurking about the edges of such situations introduce a typical Rhetorical wrangle of the sort that can never be settled once and for all, but belongs in the field of moral controversy where men properly seek to ‘prove opposites’” (26).

===Identification and Autonomy===

Identification can also be seen as the way in which specialized activities occupy, rather than transcend or escape, larger contexts: “The fact that an activity is capable of reduction to intrinsic, autonomous principles does not argue that it is free from identification with other orders of motivation extrinsic to it. Such other orders are extrinsic to it, as considered from the standpoint of the specialized activity alone. However, they are not extrinsic to the field of moral action as such, considered from the standpoint of human activity in general. . . . ‘Identification is a word for the autonomous activity’s place in this wider context.” (27)

Identification in this particular aspect is thus yet another major path into, or topic of, rhetoric; for example, “we are clearly in the region of rhetoric when considering the identifications whereby a specialized activity makes one a participant in some social or economic class. ‘Belonging’ in this sense is rhetorical.” (28) Such identification can become sinister when unacknowledged or hidden. Moreover, consubstantiality implies that sinister morality can spread through both substances, as when the morality associated with a so-called autonomous activity serves as the morality for the larger context with which it is identified: “One’s morality as a specialist cannot be allowed to do duty for one’s morality as a citizen. Insofar as the two roles are at odds, a specialty at the service of sinister interests will itself become sinister.” (31)

===Identification and Cunning===

Here Burke suggests expanding the realm of rhetoric to include the ways in which we operate rhetorically upon ourselves, forging identifications through unexamined or nonconscious motives, self-protective or suicidal. “If a social or occupational class is not too exacting in the scrutiny of identifications that flatter its interests, its very life is a profitable malingering (profitable at least until its inaccuracies catch up with it) — and as such, it is open to attack or analysis, Rhetoric comprising both the ''use'' of persuasive resources ''(rhetorica utens,'' as with the philippics of Demosthenes) and the study of them ''(rhetorica docens,'' as with Aristotle’s treatise on the ‘art’ of Rhetoric)” (36). The key element here that brings in cunning is consciousness, or perhaps more to the point, purposeful unconsciousness, or hypocrisy: “This aspect of identification, whereby one can protect an interest merely by not using terms incisive enough to criticize it properly, often brings rhetoric to the edge of cunning” (36).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1924">In [[conservation biology]], '''invader potential''' is the qualitative and quantitative measure of a given [[invasive species]] probability to invade a given [[ecosystem]]. Exotic species with high invader potential are ones with high tolerance of different climates, [[Hypoxia (environmental)|dissolved oxygen content]] (for aquatic organisms), high [[propagule pressure]] and species with a large number of individuals introduced. The last factor is called a transport vector, for instance, [[sea lamprey]]s and [[zebra mussel]]s were transported into the [[Great Lakes]] through the vector of ballast water in ships. Transport vector is one of the most important factors, because if a large enough number of individuals are transported to an area that they cannot thrive in, a mutation within that population to thrive in the new ecosystem is more likely.

Most invaders are adapted to disturbed areas, so ecosystems that have been disrupted or roadside ditches are susceptible to invasion.

Climate matching is one of the most common measures of invader potential. Mostly exotic species that have already exhibited invasive traits are studied. 

Biotic resistance is a controversial concept in invader potential. Small scale studies have borne the concept of diversity resistance, that diverse ecosystems resist invasions better than less diverse ecosystems. However, evidence on regional scales finds a positive correlation between diversity and number of invasions. The exact interpretation of these studies is unclear.

'''Island tameness''' is the tendency of many populations and [[species]] of animals living on isolated [[island]]s to lose their wariness of potential [[predation|predators]], particularly of large animals. The term is partly synonymous with '''ecological naïvete''', which also has a wider meaning referring to the loss of defensive behaviors and [[adaptation]]s needed to deal with these "new" predators. Species retain such wariness of predators that exist in their environment, for example a [[Hawaiian goose]] retains its wariness of hawks, but lose such behaviors associated with mammals or other predators not found in their historical range. The most famous example is that of the dodo bird, which owed its extinction in a large part to a lack of fear of humans, and many species of [[penguin]] - which although wary of sea predators have no real land predator, and therefore are very unafraid and curious towards humans.

A recent comparison of 66 species of [[lizards]] found that flight initiation distance (how close a lizard allows a human "predator" to approach before it flees) decreases as distance from the mainland increases and is shorter in island than mainland populations.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, W. E., Jr., R. A. Pyron, and [[Theodore Garland, Jr.|T. Garland, Jr.]] 2014. Island tameness: living on islands reduces flight initiation distance. Proceedings of the Royal Society B Volume 281 no. 1777 20133019. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2013.3019&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the authors, [[Charles Darwin]] believed that escape behavior evolved to be lower where [[predator]]s were rare or absent on remote islands because unnecessary escape responses are costly in terms of time and energy.

Island tameness can be highly maladaptive in situations where humans have [[introduced species|introduced]] predators, intentionally or accidentally, such as pigs, dogs, rats or cats, to islands where [[ecology|ecologically]] naïve fauna lives.  It has also made many [[Island biogeography|island species]], such as the long-extinct [[dodo]] or the [[short-tailed albatross]], vulnerable to human hunting. In many instances the native species are unable to learn to avoid new predators, or change their behavior to minimize their risk. This tameness is eventually lost or reduced in some species, but many island populations are too small or breed too slowly for the affected species to adapt quickly enough. When combined with other threats, such as habitat loss, this has led to the extinction of many species (such as the [[Laysan rail]] and [[Lyall's wren]]) and continues to threaten others. The only [[conservation biology|conservation]] techniques that can help endangered species threatened by novel introduced species are creating barriers to exclude predators or [[island restoration|eradicating]] those species. [[New Zealand]] has pioneered the use of offshore islands free of introduced species to serve as wildlife refuges for ecologically naïve species.

In microbiology, the term '''isolation''' refers to the separation of a strain from a natural, mixed population of living [[microbe]]s, as present in the environment, for example in water or [[soil flora]], or from living beings with [[skin flora]], [[oral flora]] or [[gut flora]], in order to [[identification (biology)|identify]] the microbe(s) of interest. Historically, the [[laboratory techniques]] of isolation first developed in the field of [[bacteriology]] and [[parasitology]] (during the 19th century), before those in [[virology]] during the 20th century. Methods of microbial isolation have drastically changed over the past 50 years, from a labor perspective with increasing mechanization, and in regard to the technology involved, and hence speed and accuracy.

==History==
The [[laboratory techniques]] of isolating [[microbe]]s first developed during the 19th century in the field of [[bacteriology]] and [[parasitology]] using [[light microscopy]]. Proper isolation techniques of [[virology]] did not exist prior to the 20th century. The methods of microbial isolation have drastically changed over the past 50 years, from a labor perspective with increasing mechanization, and in regard to the technologies involved, and with it speed and accuracy.

==General techniques==
In order to isolate a microbe from a natural, mixed population of living [[microbe]]s, as present in the environment, for example in water or [[soil flora]], or from living beings with [[skin flora]], [[oral flora]] or [[gut flora]], one has to separate it from the mix.

Traditionally microbes have been [[microbiological culture|cultured]] in order to [[identification (biology)|identify]] the microbe(s) of interest based on its growth characteristics. 
Depending on the expected density and viability of microbes present in a liquid sample, physical methods to increase the gradient as for example [[serial dilution]] or [[centrifugation]] may be chosen.
In order to isolate organisms in materials with high microbial content, such as sewage, soil or stool, serial dilutions will increase the chance of separating a mixture.

In a liquid medium with few or no expected organisms, from an area that is normally sterile (such as [[Cerebrospinal fluid|CSF]], blood inside the circulatory system) centrifugation, decanting the supernatant and using only the sediment will increase the chance to grow and isolate bacteria or the usually cell-associated viruses.

If one expects or looks for a particularly [[fastidious]] organism, the [[microbiological culture]] and isolation techniques will have to be geared towards that microbe. For example, a bacterium that dies when exposed to air, can only be isolated if the sample is carried and processed under airless or anaerobic conditions. A bacterium that dies when exposed to room temperature (thermophilic) requires a pre-warmed transport container, and a microbe that dries and dies when carried on a cotton swab will need a viral [[transport medium]] before it can be cultured successfully.

==Bacterial and fungal culture==

===Inoculation===
Laboratory technicians [[inoculation|inoculate]] the sample onto certain solid [[agar plate]]s with the [[Streaking (microbiology)|streak plate method]] or into liquid [[culture medium]], depending what the objective of the isolation is:

* If one wants to isolate only ''a particular'' group of bacteria, such as [[Streptococcus pyogenes|Group A Streptococcus]] from a throat swab, one can use a [[selective medium]] that will suppress the growth of concomitant bacteria expected in the mix (by antibiotics present in the agar), so that only Streptococci are "selected", i.e. visibly stand out. To isolate fungi, [[Sabouraud agar]] can be used. Alternatively, lethal conditions for streptococci and gram negative bacteria like high [[sodium chloride|salt]] concentrations in [[Mannitol salt agar]] favor survival of any [[staphylococci]] present in a sample of gut bacteria, and [[phenol red]] in the agar acts as a [[ph indicator]] showing if the bacteria are able to ferment [[mannitol]] by excreting acid into the medium. In other agar substances are added to exploit an organism's ability to produce a visible pigment (e.g. [[granada medium]] for [[Group B Streptococcus]]) which changes the [[bacterial colony]]'s color, or to dissolve [[blood agar]] by [[hemolysis]] so that they can be more easily spotted. Some bacteria like [[Legionella species]] require particular nutrients or toxin binding as in [[charcoal]] to grow and therefore media such as [[Buffered charcoal yeast extract agar]] must be used.
* If one wants to isolate ''as many or all'' strains possible, different nutrient media as well as enriched media, such as [[blood agar]] and [[chocolate agar]] and anaerobic culture media such as [[thioglycolate broth]] need to be inoculated. To enumerate the growth, bacteria can be suspended in molten agar before it becomes solid, and then poured into [[petri dish]]es, the so-called 'pour plate method' which is used in [[environmental microbiology]] and [[food microbiology]] (e.g. dairy testing) to establish the so-called 'aerobic plate count'.

===Incubation===   
After the sample is inoculated into or onto the choice media, they are [[:wikt:incubation|incubated]] under the appropriate atmospheric settings, such as aerobic, anaerobic or [[microaerophilic]] conditions or with added carbon dioxide (5%), at different temperature settings, for example 37&amp;nbsp;°C in an [[Incubator (culture)|incubator]] or in a refrigerator for cold enrichment, under appropriate light, for example strictly without light wrapped in paper or in a dark bottle for [[scotochromogen]] mycobacteria, and for different lengths of time, because different bacteria grow at a different speed, varying from hours ([[Escherichia coli]]) to weeks (e.g.[[mycobacteria]]).
 
At regular, serial intervals [[Medical technologist|laboratory technicians]] and [[microbiologist]]s inspect the media for signs of visible growth and record it. The inspection again has to occur under conditions favoring the isolate's survival, i.e. in an 'anaerobic chamber' for anaerobe bacteria for example, and under conditions that do not threaten the person looking at the plates from being infected by a particularly infectious microbe, i.e. under a [[biological safety cabinet]] for [[Yersinia pestis]] (plague) or [[Bacillus anthracis]] (anthrax) for example.

===Identification===
When bacteria have visibly grown, they are often still mixed. The identification of a microbe depends upon the isolation of an individual [[colony (biology)|colony]], as biochemical testing of a microbe to determine its different physiological features depends on a [[pure culture]].
To make a [[subculture (biology)|subculture]], one again works in [[aseptic technique in microbiology]], lifting a single colony off the agar surface with a loop and streaks the material into the 4 quadrants of an agar plate or all over if the colony was singular and did not look mixed.
 
[[Gram stain]]ing the raw sample before incubation or staining freshly grown colony material helps to determine if a colony consists of uniformly appearing bacteria or is mixed, and the color, and shape of bacteria allow a first classification based on morphology. In clinical microbiology numerous other staining techniques for particular organisms are used (acid fast bacterial stain for mycobacteria). Immunological staining techniques, such as [[direct immunofluorescence]] have been developed for medically important [[pathogen]]s that are slow growing ([[Auramine-rhodamine stain]] for mycobacteria) or difficult to grow (such as Legionella pneumophila species) and where the test result would alter standard management and [[empirical therapy]].

Biochemical testing of bacteria involves a set of agars in vials to separate motile from [[non-motile bacteria]].
In 1970 a miniaturized version was developed, called the [[analytical profile index]].

Successful identification via e.g. [[genome sequencing]] and [[genomics]] depends on pure cultures.

==Bacteria, culture-independent==
While the most rapid method to identify bacteria is by sequencing their [[16S rRNA]] gene, which has been [[PCR-amplification|PCR-amplified]] beforehand, this does method not require isolation. Since most bacteria cannot be grown with conventional methods (particularly environmental or soil bacteria) [[metagenomics]] or [[metatranscriptomics]] are used, [[shotgun sequencing]] or PCR directed [[genome sequencing|sequencing of the genome]].  Sequencing with [[mass spectrometry]] as in [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF MS) is used in the analysis of clinical specimens to look for pathogens. [[Whole genome sequencing]] is an option for a singular organism that cannot be sufficiently characterized for identification. Small [[DNA microarray]]s can also be used for identification.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7504">'''Memory dependence prediction''' is a technique, employed by high-performance [[out-of-order execution]] [[microprocessor]]s that execute [[primary storage|memory]] access operations (loads and stores) out of program order, to predict true dependencies between loads and stores at [[instruction (computer science)|instruction]] [[execution (computers)|execution]] time. With the predicted dependence information, the processor can then decide to [[speculative execution|speculatively execute]] certain loads and stores out of order, while preventing other loads and stores from executing out-of-order (keeping them in-order). Later in the [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]], [[memory disambiguation]] techniques are used to determine if the loads and stores were correctly executed and, if not, to recover.

By using the memory dependence predictor to keep most dependent loads and stores in order, the processor gains the benefits of aggressive out-of-order load/store execution but avoids many of the memory dependence violations that occur when loads and stores were incorrectly executed. This increases performance because it reduces the number of [[pipeline flush]]es that are required to recover from these memory dependence violations. See the [[memory disambiguation]] article for more information on memory dependencies, memory dependence violations, and recovery.

In general, memory dependence prediction predicts whether two memory operations are dependent, that is, if they interact by accessing the same memory location. Besides using store to load (RAW or true) memory dependence prediction for the out-of-order scheduling of loads and stores, other applications of memory dependence prediction have been proposed. See for example.&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP"&gt;Streamlining Inter-Operation Memory Communication via Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the Annual ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Microarchitecture, Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Memory dependence prediction is an optimization on top of '''memory dependence speculation'''. Sequential execution semantics imply that stores and loads appear to execute in the order specified by the program. However, as with out-of-order execution of other instructions, it may be possible to execute two memory operations in a different from the program implied order. This is possible when the two operations are independent. In memory dependence speculation a load may be allowed to execute before a store that precedes it. Speculation succeeds when the load is independent of the store, that is, when the two instructions access different memory locations. Speculation fails when the load is dependent upon the store, that is, when the two accesses overlap in memory. In the first, modern out-of-order designs, memory speculation was not used as its benefits were limited. Αs the scope of the out-of-order execution increased over few tens of instructions, naive memory dependence speculation was used. In '''naive memory dependence speculation''',&lt;ref name="SaSoMD"&gt;Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization of Memory Dependences, Moshovos, Breach, Vijaykumar and Sohi, in the Proceedings of the 24th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1997. Also as technical report, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, March 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; a load is allowed to bypass any preceding store. As with any form of speculation, it is important to weight the benefits of correct speculation against the penalty paid on incorrect speculation. As the scope of out-of-order execution increases further into several tens of instructions, the performance benefits of naive speculation decrease. To retain the benefits of aggressive memory dependence speculation while avoiding the costs of mispeculation several predictors have been proposed.

'''Selective memory dependence prediction'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP"&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction, Moshovos, Ph.D. Thesis, Computer Sciences Department, University of Wisconsin–Madison, Dec. 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; stalls specific loads until it is certain that no violation may occur. It does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may delay loads longer than necessary and hence result in suboptimal performance. In fact, in some cases it performs worse than naively speculating all loads as early as possible. This is because often its faster to mispeculate and recover than to wait for all preceding stores to execute. Exact memory dependence prediction was developed at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. Specifically, '''Dynamic Speculation and Synchronization'''&lt;ref name="SaSoMD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MDP" /&gt; delays loads only as long as it is necessary by predicting the exact store a load should wait for. This predictor predicts exact dependences (store and load pair). The '''synonym predictor'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; groups together all dependences that share a common load or store instruction. The '''store sets'''&lt;ref&gt;Memory Dependence Prediction using Store Sets, Chrysos and Emer, in the Proceedings of the 25th Annual ACM/IEEE Conference on Computer Architecture, June 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor represents multiple potential dependences efficiently by grouping together all possible stores a load may dependent upon. The '''store barrier'''&lt;ref&gt;Apparatus to dynamically control the out-of-order execution of load-store instructions in a processor capable of dispatching, issuing and executing multiple instructions in a single processor cycle, Hesson, LeBlanc and Ciavaglia, IBM, US Patent 5,615,350, March 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; predictor treats certain store instructions as barriers. That is, all subsequent load or store operations are not allowed to bypass the specific store. The store barrier predictor does not explicitly predict dependencies. This predictor may unnecessarily delay subsequent, yet independent loads. Memory dependence prediction has other applications beyond the scheduling of loads and stores. For example, '''speculative memory cloaking'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; and '''speculative memory bypassing'''&lt;ref name="SIOMCvMDP" /&gt; use memory dependence prediction to streamline the communication of values through memory.

==Analogy to branch prediction==
Memory dependence prediction for loads and stores is analogous to [[branch predictor|branch prediction]] for [[conditional branch]] instructions. In branch prediction, the branch predictor predicts which way the branch will resolve before it is known. The processor can then speculatively fetch and execute instructions down one of the paths of the branch. Later, when the branch instruction executes, it can be determined if the branch instruction was correctly predicted. If not, this is a [[misprediction|branch misprediction]], and a pipeline flush is necessary to throw away instructions that were speculatively fetched and executed.

Branch prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines the direction of the branch (taken or not). This is a binary decision. Then, the predictor determines the actual target address. Similarly, memory dependence prediction can be thought of as a two step process. First, the predictor determines whether there is a dependence. Then it determines which this dependence is.

'''Metanoia''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|μετάνοια}}, ''metanoia'', ''changing one's mind'') in the context of [[rhetoric]] is a device used to retract a statement just made, and then state it in a better way.&lt;ref name="meta1"&gt;Silva Rhetoricae (2006). [http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm Metanoeia] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071117043043/http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/metanoeia.htm |date=2007-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, metanoia is similar to correction. Metanoia is used in recalling a statement in two ways—-to weaken the prior declaration or to strengthen it.

Metanoia is later personified as a figure accompanying [[kairos]], sometimes as a hag and sometimes as a young lady. Ausonius' epigrams describe her thus: "I am a goddess to whom even Cicero himself did not give a name. I am the goddess who exacts punishment for what has and has not been done, so that people regret it. Hence my name is Metanoea." &lt;ref&gt; Qtd. in Myers, Kelly A. "Metanoia and the Transformation of Opportunity" RSA 41.1 pp1-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weakening==

The use of metanoia to weaken a statement is effective because the original statement still stands, along with the qualifying statement.&lt;ref name="meta2"&gt;VirtualSalt.com (2006). [http://www.virtualsalt.com/rhetoric.htm#Metanoia A Handbook of Rhetorical Devices]&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, when one says, "I will murder you. You shall be punished," the force of the original statement ("I will murder you") remains, while a more realistic alternative has been put forward ("you shall be punished").

==Strengthening==

When it is used to strengthen a statement, metanoia works to ease the reader from a moderate statement to a more radical one, as in this quote from [[Marcus Aurelius]]'s ''[[Meditations]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I still fall short of it through my own fault, and through not observing
the admonitions of the gods, and, I may almost say, their direct instructions (Book One);&lt;ref name="meta3"&gt;The Internet Classics Archive (2006). [http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.mb.txt The Meditations]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here Aurelius utilizes metanoia to move from a mild idea ("not observing the admonitions of the gods") to a more intense one ("not observing... their direct instructions"); the clause "I may almost say" introduces the metanoia.

Misattribution is one of many [[theories of humor]] that describes an audience's inability to identify exactly why they find a [[joke]] to be [[funny]].  The formal theory is attributed to Zillmann &amp; Bryant (1980) in their article, "Misattribution Theory of Tendentious Humor", published in ''[[Journal of Experimental Social Psychology]]''.  They derived the critical concepts of the theory from [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''[[Wit and Its Relation to the Unconscious]]'', originally published in 1905.  Freud declared people incapable of knowing exactly what it is they find amusing due to the complex nature of their [[conscious]] and [[subconscious]] minds.  Jokes are crafted by comedians who have experience with causing laughter but who may themselves be blind to the actual cause of humor.

==Tendentious vs. innocuous humor==
Freud made a key distinction between tendentious and non-tendentious humor.  Tendentious humor involves a "victim", someone at whose expense we laugh.  Non-tendentious humor does not require a victim.  This innocuous humor typically depends on wordplay, and Freud believed it has only modest power to evoke amusement.  Tendentious humor, then, is the only kind that can evoke big laughs.
However, Freud believed a mixture of both tendentious and non-tendentious humor is required to keep the tendentious humor from becoming too offensive or demeaning to its victim.  The innocent jokework of the innocuous humor would mask the otherwise hostile joke and therefore "bribe" our senses, allowing us to laugh at what would otherwise be socially unacceptable.  Therefore, we often think we are laughing at innocuous jokes, but what really makes them funny is their socially unacceptable nature hidden below the surface.

==Empirical study==
To further examine Freud's concepts, [[media scholar]]s Dolf Zillmann &amp; Jennings Bryant set up an experimental situation to combine and/or separate tendentious and non-tendentious humor.  Their findings confirmed the expectations that amusement was highest when all of the ingredients of good comedy were present.  In conjunction with disposition theory of mirth (Zillmann &amp; Cantor, 1976), audiences predictably enjoyed witnessing the demise of a disliked character.  However, the mere presence of the innocuous humor cue more than doubled the amusement in response to the observed misfortune.
The applications to humor in film, television, and other media are quite apparent.  However, very little research has been conducted to follow up Zillmann &amp; Bryant's original experiment.

==Example in today's comedy==
Sitcom and [[comedy films]] are filled with humor based on misattribution.  For example, characters in a working-class family may banter back and forth about paying bills or finding a more respected or higher-paying job.  The delivery of dialog may come across as funny for an audience who believes the humor comes from the antagonistic relationship between the two characters.  But the real hostile nature of the joke involves class and economic issues that are otherwise not funny.
Similar analysis can be applied to issues involving racial discrimination, sexual deviancy, drug abuse, and other controversial issues.

The '''National University of the Patagonia San Juan Bosco''' (Spanish: ''Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia San Juan Bosco'') is a [[higher education]] establishment in [[Patagonia]], southern [[Argentina]]. It was created on February 25, 1980, by law 22.713, as the merge of two national universities: the "Universidad de San Juan Bosco" and "Universidad Nacional de la Patagonia". It is named after [[John Bosco|San Juan Bosco]], patron saint of the area.

The university has four schools - [[Engineering]], [[Economy]], [[Humanities]], [[Legal]], and [[Natural Sciences]], spread over several cities in Patagonia: [[Puerto Madryn]], [[Trelew]], [[Esquel]], [[Comodoro Rivadavia]], and [[Ushuaia]]. The central faculty is located in Comodoro Rivadavia.
The University has {{As of|2005|lc=on}} 14,000 students, with 5000 in the main school.

In 2015, the university opened to the inhabitants of the [[Falkland Islands]]. The academic program was translated into English, language courses were designed and a system of special scholarship was established. Thus, National University of the Patagonia San Juan Bosco became the first Argentine university to extend their academic offer to [[Falkland Islanders]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elpatagonico.com/con-la-presencia-filmus-la-universidad-presenta-su-oferta-academica-los-habitantes-islas-malvinas-n1288000&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Non-photorealistic rendering''' (NPR) is an area of [[computer graphics]] that focuses on enabling a wide variety of expressive [[style (visual arts)|style]]s for digital art.  In contrast to traditional [[computer graphics]], which has focused on [[photorealism]], NPR is inspired by artistic styles such as [[painting]], [[drawing]], [[technical illustration]], and [[animated cartoons]]. NPR has appeared in [[Film|movies]] and [[video game]]s in the form of "[[toon shading]]", as well as in [[scientific visualization]], [[architectural illustration]] and [[experimental animation]]. An example of a modern use of this method is that of [[cel-shaded animation]].

==History==
The term "non-photorealistic rendering" is believed to have been coined by the SIGGRAPH 1990 papers committee, who held a session entitled "Non Photo Realistic Rendering"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chairman-Baskett|first=Forest|date=1990-09-01|title=Proceedings of the 17th annual conference on Computer graphics and interactive techniques|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=97879|journal=SIGGRAPH|publisher=ACM|volume=|pages=|isbn=0897913442|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eprints.mdx.ac.uk/6723/|title=Non-photorealistic rendering: a critical examination and proposed system.|last=Simon|first=Schofield,|date=March 1994|website=eprints.mdx.ac.uk|language=en|accessdate=2018-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term, however, has received criticism; some criticisms include: 
* The term "[[photorealism]]" has different meanings for graphics researchers and artists.  For artists, who are the target consumers of NPR techniques, it refers to a school of painting that focuses on reproducing the effect of a camera lens, with all the distortion and hyper-reflections that it involves.  For graphics researchers, it refers to an image that is visually indistinguishable from reality.  In fact, graphics researchers lump the kinds of visual distortions that are used by photorealist painters into non-photorealism.
* Describing something by what it is not is problematic.  Equivalent comparisons might be "non-elephant biology", or "non-geometric mathematics".  NPR researchers have stated that they expect the term will disappear eventually, and be replaced by the more general term "computer graphics", with "photorealistic graphics" being used to describe traditional computer graphics.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* Many techniques that are used to create 'non-photorealistic' images are not [[Rendering (computer graphics)|rendering]] techniques.  They are modelling techniques, or post-processing techniques.  While the latter are coming to be known as 'image-based rendering', sketch-based modelling techniques, cannot technically be included under this heading, which is very inconvenient for conference organisers.

The first conference on Non-Photorealistic Animation and Rendering included a discussion of possible alternative names.  Among those suggested were "expressive graphics", "artistic rendering", "non-realistic graphics", "art-based rendering", and "psychographics".  All of these terms have been used in various research papers on the topic, but the term NPR seems to have nonetheless taken hold.

The first technical meeting dedicated to NPR was the ACM sponsored Symposium on Non-Photorealistic Rendering and Animation&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npar.org|title=npar.org - This website is for sale! - npar Resources and Information.|author=|date=|website=www.npar.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; (NPAR) in 2000.  NPAR is traditionally co-located with the Annecy Animated Film Festival,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annecy.org|title=Site officiel du Festival et du Marché international du film d'animation d'Annecy|first=©|last=CITIA|date=|website=www.annecy.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; running on even numbered years.  From 2007 NPAR began to also run on odd-numbered years, co-located with ACM SIGGRAPH.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siggraph.org{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==3D==
[[File:Planar core assembly exploded.png|thumb|An example of NPR used for technical illustrations]]
Three-dimensional NPR is the style that is most commonly seen in video games and movies.  The output from this technique is almost always a [[polygonal modeling|3D model]] that has been modified from the original input model to portray a new artistic style.  In many cases, the [[solid geometry|geometry]] of the model is identical to the original geometry, and only the material applied to the surface is modified. With increased availability of programmable [[GPU]]'s, [[shaders]] have allowed NPR effects to be applied to the [[rasterised]] image that is to be displayed to the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://developer.amd.com/media/gpu_assets/ShaderX_NPR.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-03-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615093204/http://developer.amd.com/media/gpu_assets/ShaderX_NPR.pdf |archive-date=2011-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of NPR techniques applied to 3D geometry are intended to make the scene appear two-dimensional.

NPR techniques for 3D images include [[cel shading]] and [[Gooch shading]].

For enhanced legibility, the most useful [[technical illustration]]s for [[technical communication]] are not necessarily photorealistic.  Non-photorealistic renderings, such as [[exploded view]] diagrams, greatly assist in showing placement of parts in a complex system.

==2D==
[[File:Cradle_Mountain_Behind_Dove_Lake_painted.jpg|thumb|300px|right|An example of a non-photoreal rendering of an existing 2D image. [[:File:Cradle_Mountain_Behind_Dove_Lake.jpg|Original may be found here]]]]

The input to a two-dimensional NPR system is most commonly an image; however, there are systems that take 3D geometry information as input and produce a 2D image or video as output.  Again, many of the systems are intended to mimic a desired artistic style, such as [[watercolor]], [[impressionism]], or [[pen and ink]] drawing. Sketchy style is a rendering form that mimic hand-drawn graph primitive.

Users who are interested in having much more control in the NPR process may be more interested in interactive techniques.  Many of these NPR systems provide the user with a canvas that they can "paint" on using the cursor&amp;nbsp;— as the user paints, a stylized version of the image is revealed on the canvas.  This is especially useful for people who want to simulate different sizes of brush strokes according to different areas of the image.

In contrast to the methods mentioned previously, another technique in NPR is simulating the painter's medium.  Methods include simulating the [[diffusion]] of [[inks|ink]] through different kinds of [[paper]], and also of [[pigment]]s through water for simulation of watercolor.

[[File:Telematica Instituut.jpg|thumb|240px|Office building of Novay institute among others, Enschede, Netherlands.]]
'''Novay''', formally known as the ''Telematica Instituut'' was a Dutch [[research institute]] in the field of [[information technology]], founded in 1997, known for its development of [[ArchiMate]]. In 2009 the Telematica Instituut was reorganized and operated under the new name Novay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telin.nl/index.cfm?language=en Telematica Instituut becomes Novay]. Accessed 26 Feb 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It filed for bankruptcy April 3, 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://drimble.nl/faillissementen/overijssel/enschede/41032471/stichting-novay.html Stichting Novay; Uitspraak faillissement op 2 april 2014] at drimble.nl.&lt;/ref&gt; and is dissolved.

== Overview ==
Novay was a public-private partnership of knowledge institutes and companies with the objective of increasing the competitive power and innovative capability of the Dutch business community.&lt;ref name="TI02"&gt;Telematica Instituut (2001). [https://doc.telin.nl/dsweb/Get/Document-25044/20038_Telematica_EN.pdf Annual report 2001]. Accessed 15 Jan 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It is managed and funded by top companies and the government. It aims to translate fundamental knowledge into market-oriented research for the public and private sectors in the field of [[telematics]]: multimedia, electronic commerce, mobile communications, CSCW, knowledge management, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Brian J. Corbitt, Nabeel A. Y. Al-Qirim (2004). ''E-Business, E-Government and Small and Medium-Size Enterprises''. Idea Group Inc (IGI), 2004. {{ISBN|1591402646}}, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Novay focused on total solutions that can be applied directly in [[business]]es and [[society]] at large. It gathers insights from a wide range of subject areas, such as information technology, business economics, organisational science, psychology and sociology. These insights are developed further in multidisciplinary teams and forged into new concepts, products and services in the area of information and communication technology.&lt;ref name="TI02"/&gt;

== Research and development ==
Notable Telematica Instituut/Novay research projects have focussed on:
* [[Testbed]], an [[architecture]] of [[business processes]]: a software tool and supporting resources for analysing, designing, simulating and introducing business processes. The tool provides information on the consequences of changes in business processes in areas such as service levels, production time and costs, workflow and automation, even before the actual processes have been introduced. In addition, the graphical interface makes the processes understandable for non-specialists.
* Friends, Customised Internet services: This project delivered a component-based middleware platform for the development, rollout and use of all kinds of Internet services.&lt;ref name="TI02"/&gt;
* [[ArchiMate]] : An open and independent [[modelling language]] for [[enterprise architecture]], supported by different tool vendors and consulting firms. It provides instruments to support enterprise architects in describing, analyzing and visualizing the relationships among [[business]] domains in an unambiguous way. ArchiMate is one of the open standards hosted by the [[Open Group]] and based on the [[IEEE 1471]] standard.&lt;ref name="TI02"/&gt; The ArchiMate framework was developed by the Telematica Instituut to offer companies a simple and intuitive concept that reconciles both IT and business aspects. The standard is constantly being enhanced through the work of an international forum, the ArchiMate forum.&lt;ref&gt;[[IDS Scheer]] (2007)[http://www.ids-scheer.com/us/en/News/IDS_Scheer_Expands_its_Enterprise_Architecture_Management_Range_with_ARIS_ArchiMate_Modeler/1640.html?referer=32430&amp; IDS Scheer Expands its Enterprise Architecture Management Range with ARIS ArchiMate Modeler].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3784">'''Nutation''' is the bending movements executed by some [[plant organ]]s, such as stems, leaves, roots, etc., by which the part is inclined successively in various directions.&lt;ref name="int-incorporate"&gt;{{NIE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nutations are due to the unequal rate of growth of different sides of the organ, an inequality which, so far as is known at present (c. 1915), is dependent upon internal (unknown) causes and is not called forth by the action of external stimuli.  The word is often used in a broad sense in the phrase ''nutational movement'', to include all the movements in plants caused by growth in contrast to ''variation movements'' or movements produced by reversible [[Turgor pressure|turgor]] changes.&lt;ref name="int-incorporate" /&gt;

Simple nutation occurs in [[dorsiventral]] organs, such as flat leaves, both [[foliage]] and floral.  The movements are only in one plane, depending upon the unequal growth of the opposite sides.  When young the growth of the foliage leaves is most rapid upon their outer (dorsal) face, in consequence of which the leaf applies itself to the axis, arches over the apex, and with its neighbors forms a compact bud.  Later growth becomes more rapid on the inner (ventral) face, the bud opens, and the leaves straighten out.  Similar inequality of growth, but more sharply localized, leads to the folding and rolling of the leaf in the bud.  Like movements of radial organs, such as stems, cylindrical leaves, and roots, have been termed circumnutation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stolarz|first1=Maria|title=Circumnutation as a visible plant action and reaction|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|date=28 October 2014|volume=4|issue=5|pages=380–387|doi=10.4161/psb.4.5.8293|pmid=19816110|quote=Circumnutation is a helical organ movement widespread among plants.|pmc=2676747}}&lt;/ref&gt;, or revolving nutation, to distinguish them from the simple nutation of dorsiventral organs. One of the first published works on circumnutation came from Charles Darwin who believed it to be a fundamental process utilized by plants to direct growth and tropistic responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Allan H.|date=September 28, 1992|title=Circumnutations: From Darwin to Space Flights|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/plantphysiol/101/2/345.full.pdf|journal=Plant Physiology|volume=101|pages=345–348|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; When any plant is in vigorous growth the axis rarely grows in length uniformly on all sides.  The side on which growth is most rapid will push the apex over towards the side on which growth is less rapid.  If the region of more rapid growth changes, shifting around the axis, the tip will be inclined successively to all points of the compass and with its simultaneous upward growth will describe a spiral, but, since the rate of growth is not uniform at successive intervals, the path described will be a very irregular spiral.&lt;ref name="int-incorporate" /&gt;

Movements quite similar to those above described are called forth in plant organs by external [[stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]].  Thus twining plants exhibit both true nutation and nutation due to geotropic sensitiveness.  Changes in temperature cause flowers to open or close by movements which resemble the simple nutation of dorsiventral organs.  Thus, the [[tulip]], [[crocus]], and other vernal flowers are very sensitive to changes in temperature.  The crocus can perceive a change of 0.5°C (0.9°F), and will respond to a change of 20°C (36°F) in two minutes.&lt;ref name="int-incorporate" /&gt;

A '''physics engine''' is [[computer software]] that provides an approximate [[Computer simulation|simulation]] of certain [[physical system]]s, such as [[rigid body dynamics]] (including [[collision detection]]), [[soft body dynamics]], and [[Fluid simulation|fluid dynamics]], of use in the [[wikt:domain|domain]]s of [[computer graphics]], [[video game]]s and [[film]]. Their main uses are in video games (typically as [[game middleware|middleware]]), in which case the [[simulation]]s are in [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]]. The term is sometimes used more generally to describe any [[software system]] for simulating physical phenomena, such as [[High-performance computing|high-performance scientific simulation]].

== Description ==
There are generally two classes of physics [[Software engine|engine]]s: [[Real-time computer graphics|real-time]] and high-precision. High-precision physics engines require more processing power to calculate very [[Accuracy and precision|precise]] physics and are usually used by scientists and computer animated movies. Real-time physics engines—as used in video games and other forms of interactive computing—use simplified calculations and decreased accuracy to compute in time for the game to respond at an appropriate rate for gameplay.

=== Scientific engines ===
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}
One of the first general purpose computers, [[ENIAC]], was used as a very simple type of physics engine. It was used to design ballistics tables to help the United States military estimate where [[artillery]] shells of various mass would land when fired at varying angles and gunpowder charges, also accounting for drift caused by wind. The results were calculated a single time only, and were tabulated into printed tables handed out to the artillery commanders.

Physics engines have been commonly used on supercomputers since the 1980s to perform [[computational fluid dynamics]] modeling, where particles are assigned [[force vector]]s that are combined to show circulation. Due to the requirements of speed and high precision, special computer processors known as [[vector processor]]s were developed to accelerate the calculations. The techniques can be used to model weather patterns in [[weather forecasting]], wind tunnel data for designing air- and watercraft or motor vehicles including racecars, and thermal cooling of computer processors for improving [[heat sink]]s. As with many calculation-laden processes in computing, the accuracy of the simulation is related to the resolution of the simulation and the precision of the calculations; [[butterfly effect|small fluctuations]] not modeled in the simulation can drastically change the predicted results.

Tire manufacturers use physics simulations to examine how new [[tread|tire tread]] types will perform under wet and dry conditions, using new tire materials of varying flexibility and under different levels of weight loading.

=== Game engines ===
{{Main|Game engine|Game physics}}

In most computer games, speed of the processors and [[gameplay]] are more important than accuracy of simulation.  This leads to designs for physics engines that produce results in real-time but that replicate real world physics only for simple cases and typically with some approximation. More often than not, the simulation is geared towards providing a "perceptually correct" approximation rather than a real simulation. However some game engines, such as [[Source_(game_engine)|Source]], use physics in puzzles or in combat situations. This requires more accurate physics so that, for example, the momentum of an object can knock over an obstacle or lift a sinking object.

Physics-based character animation in the past only used [[rigid body dynamics]] because they are faster and easier to calculate, but modern games and movies are starting to use [[soft body dynamics|soft body physics]]. Soft body physics are also used for particle effects, liquids and cloth. Some form of limited [[fluid dynamics]] simulation is sometimes provided to simulate water and other liquids as well as the flow of fire and explosions through the air.

==== Collision detection ====
Objects in games interact with the player, the environment, and each other. Typically, most 3D objects in games are represented by two separate meshes or shapes. One of these meshes is the highly complex and detailed shape visible to the player in the game, such as a vase with elegant curved and looping handles. For purpose of speed, a second, simplified invisible mesh is used to represent the object to the physics engine so that the physics engine treats the example vase as a simple cylinder. It would thus be impossible to insert a rod or fire a projectile through the handle holes on the vase, because the physics engine model is based on the cylinder and is unaware of the handles. The simplified mesh used for physics processing is often referred to as the [[collision geometry]]. This may be a [[bounding box]], sphere, or [[convex hull]]. Engines that use bounding boxes or bounding spheres as the final shape for collision detection are considered extremely simple. Generally a bounding box is used for broad phase [[collision detection]] to narrow down the number of possible collisions before costly mesh on mesh collision detection is done in the narrow phase of collision detection.

Another aspect of precision in [[discrete collision detection]] involves the [[framerate]], or the number of moments in time per second when physics is calculated. Each frame is treated as separate from all other frames, and the space between frames is not calculated. A low framerate and a small fast-moving object causes a situation where the object does not move smoothly through space but instead seems to teleport from one point in space to the next as each frame is calculated. Projectiles moving at sufficiently high speeds will miss targets, if the target is small enough to fit in the gap between the calculated frames of the fast moving projectile. Various techniques are used to overcome this flaw, such as ''[[Second Life]]''{{'}}s representation of projectiles as arrows with invisible trailing tails longer than the gap in frames to collide with any object that might fit between the calculated frames. By contrast, [[continuous collision detection]] such as in [[Bullet (software)|Bullet]] or [[Havok (software)|Havok]] does not suffer this problem.

==== Soft-body dynamics ====
An alternative to using bounding box-based rigid body physics systems is to use a [[finite element]]-based system. In such a system, a 3-dimensional, volumetric [[tessellation]] is created of the 3D object. The tessellation results in a number of finite elements which represent aspects of the object's physical properties such as toughness, plasticity, and volume preservation. Once constructed, the finite elements are used by a [[solver]] to model the stress within the 3D object. The stress can be used to drive fracture, deformation and other physical effects with a high degree of realism and uniqueness. As the number of modeled elements is increased, the engine's ability to model physical behavior increases. The visual representation of the 3D object is altered by the finite element system through the use of a [[deformation shader]] run on the CPU or GPU. Finite Element-based systems had been impractical for use in games due to the performance overhead and the lack of tools to create finite element representations out of 3D art objects. With higher performance processors and tools to rapidly create the volumetric tessellations, real-time finite element systems began to be used in games, beginning with ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' that used [[Digital Molecular Matter]] for the deformation and destruction effects of wood, steel, flesh and plants using an algorithm developed by Dr. James O'Brien as a part of his PhD thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://graphics.eecs.berkeley.edu/site_root/papers/Obrien-GMA-1999-08/ |title=Graphical Modeling and Animation of Brittle Fracture|publisher=Graphics.eecs.berkeley.edu|accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Brownian motion ====
In the real world, physics is always active. There is a constant [[Brownian motion]] jitter to all particles in our universe as the forces push back and forth against each other. For a [[game physics]] engine, such constant active precision is unnecessarily wasting the limited CPU power, which can cause problems such as decreased [[framerate]]. Thus, games may put objects to "sleep" by disabling the computation of physics on objects that have not moved a particular distance within a certain amount of time. For example, in the 3D [[virtual world]] [[Second Life]], if an object is resting on the floor and the object does not move beyond a minimal distance in about two seconds, then the physics calculations are disabled for the object and it becomes frozen in place. The object remains frozen until physics processing reactivates for the object after collision occurs with some other active physical object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Doc:Manual/Game_Engine/Logic/Object_type/Rigid_body |title=Doc:Manual/Game Engine/Logic/Object type/Rigid body - BlenderWiki |publisher=Wiki.blender.org |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Paradigms ====
Physics engines for video games typically have two core components, a [[collision detection]]/[[collision response]] system, and the [[Dynamical simulation|dynamics simulation]] component responsible for solving the forces affecting the simulated objects. Modern physics engines may also contain [[Computational fluid dynamics|fluid simulations]], animation [[Motion control|control systems]] and [[COLLADA|asset integration]] tools. There are three major paradigms for the physical simulation of solids: &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Erleben |first1=Kenny |last2=Sporring |first2=Jon |last3=Henriksen |first3=Knud |last4=Dohlmann |first4=Henrik |date=2005 |title=Physics-Based Animation}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Penalty methods, where interactions are commonly modelled as [[Soft body dynamics#Spring/mass models|mass-spring]] systems. This type of engine is popular for deformable, or [[Soft body dynamics|soft-body physics]].
* Constraint based methods, where [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint equations]] are solved that estimate physical laws.
* Impulse based methods, where [[impulse (physics)|impulse]]s are applied to object interactions.
Finally, hybrid methods are possible that combine aspects of the above paradigms.

== Limitations ==
A primary limit of physics engine [[realism (visual arts)|realism]] is the [[Accuracy and precision|precision]] of the numbers representing the positions of and forces acting upon objects. When precision is too low, [[rounding error]]s affect results and [[butterfly effect|small fluctuations]] not modeled in the simulation can drastically change the predicted results; simulated objects can behave unexpectedly or arrive at the wrong location. The errors are compounded in situations where two free-moving objects are fit together with a precision that is greater than what the physics engine can calculate. This can lead to an unnatural buildup energy in the object due to the rounding errors that begins to violently shake and eventually blow the objects apart. Any type of free-moving compound physics object can demonstrate this problem, but it is especially prone to affecting chain links under high tension and wheeled objects with actively physical bearing surfaces. Higher precision reduces the positional/force errors, but at the cost of greater CPU power needed for the calculations.

== Physics Processing Unit (PPU) ==
{{Main|Physics processing unit}}
A [[Physics processing unit|Physics Processing Unit (PPU)]] is a dedicated microprocessor designed to handle the calculations of physics, especially in the physics engine of [[video game]]s. Examples of calculations involving a PPU might include [[rigid body dynamics]], [[soft body dynamics]], [[collision detection]], [[fluid dynamics]], hair and clothing simulation, [[finite element analysis]], and fracturing of objects. The idea is that specialized processors offload time consuming tasks from a computer's CPU, much like how a [[GPU]] performs graphics operations in the main CPU's place. The term was coined by [[Ageia]]'s marketing to describe their PhysX chip to consumers. Several other technologies in the CPU-GPU spectrum have some features in common with it, although Ageia's solution was the only complete one designed, marketed, supported, and placed within a system ''exclusively as'' a PPU.

== General Purpose processing on Graphics Processing Unit (GPGPU) ==
{{Main|GPGPU}}
Hardware acceleration for physics processing is now usually provided by graphics processing units that support more general computation, a concept known as [[GPGPU|General Purpose processing on Graphics Processing Unit]]. [[AMD]] and [[NVIDIA]] provide support for rigid body dynamics computations on their latest graphics cards.

[[NVIDIA]]'s [[GeForce 8 Series]] supports a GPU-based Newtonian physics acceleration technology named ''Quantum Effects Technology''. NVIDIA provides an SDK Toolkit for [[CUDA]] ([[Compute Unified Device Architecture]]) technology that offers both a low and high-level API to the GPU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nvidia.com/page/8800_features.html |title=NVIDIA 8800 features page - Quantum Effects Technology |publisher=Nvidia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; For their GPUs, [[AMD]] offers a similar SDK, called [[Close to Metal]] (CTM), which provides a thin hardware interface.

[[PhysX]] is an example of a physics engine that can use GPGPU based hardware acceleration when it is available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7872">In [[computer science]], '''Programming Computable Functions''', or '''PCF''', is a [[type system|typed]] [[Functional programming|functional language]] introduced by [[Gordon Plotkin]] in 1977, based on previous unpublished material by [[Dana Scott]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;"PCF is a programming language for computable functions, based on LCF, Scott’s logic of computable functions" {{harv|Plotkin|1977}}. ''Programming Computable Functions'' is used by {{harv|Mitchell|1996}}. It is also referred to as ''Programming with Computable Functions'' or ''Programming language for Computable Functions''.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be considered to be an extended version of the [[typed lambda calculus]] or a simplified version of modern typed functional languages such as [[ML programming language|ML]] or [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]].

A [[fully abstract]] model for PCF was first given by [[Robin Milner|Milner]] (1977). However, since Milner's model was essentially based on the syntax of PCF it was considered less than satisfactory (Ong, 1995). The first two fully abstract models not employing syntax were formulated during the 1990s. These models are based on [[game semantics]] (Hyland and Ong, 2000; Abramsky, Jagadeesan, and Malacaria, 2000) and [[Kripke logical relations]] (O'Hearn and Riecke, 1995). For a time it was felt that neither of these models was completely satisfactory, since they were not effectively presentable. However, [[Ralph Loader]] demonstrated that no effectively presentable fully abstract model could exist, since the question of program equivalence in the finitary fragment of PCF is not decidable.

==Syntax==
The ''types'' of PCF are inductively defined as
* '''nat''' is a type
* For types ''σ'' and ''τ'', there is a type ''σ'' → ''τ''

A ''context'' is a list of pairs ''x : σ'', where ''x'' is a variable name and ''σ'' is a type, such that no variable name is duplicated. One then defines typing judgments of terms-in-context in the usual way for the following syntactical constructs:

* Variables (if ''x : σ'' is part of a context ''Γ'', then ''Γ'' ⊢ ''x'' : ''σ'')
* Application (of a term of type ''σ'' → ''τ'' to a term of type ''σ'')
* [[λ-abstraction]]
* The '''[[Fixed-point combinator#Y combinator|Y]]''' fixed point combinator (making terms of type ''σ'' out of terms of type ''σ'' → ''σ'')
* The successor ('''succ''') and predecessor ('''pred''') operations on '''nat''' and the constant '''0'''
* The conditional '''if''' with the typing rule:
: &lt;math&gt;
\frac{
\Gamma \; \vdash \; t \; : \textbf{nat} 
, \quad \quad
\Gamma \; \vdash \; s_0 \; : \sigma 
, \quad \quad
\Gamma \; \vdash \; s_1 \; : \sigma 
}
{
\Gamma \; \vdash \; \textbf{if}(t,s_0,s_1) \; : \sigma 
}
&lt;/math&gt;
: ('''nat'''s will be interpreted as booleans here with a convention like zero denoting truth, and any other number denoting falsity)

==Semantics==
&lt;!-- todo: operational semantics --&gt;

===Denotational semantics===
A relatively straightforward semantics for the language is the '''Scott model'''. In this model,

* Types are interpreted as certain [[domain theory|domains]].
** &lt;math&gt;[\![ \textbf{nat} ]\!] := \mathbb{N}_{\bot}&lt;/math&gt; (the natural numbers with a bottom element adjoined, with the flat ordering)
** &lt;math&gt;[\![ \sigma \to \tau \, ]\!]&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the domain of [[Scott-continuous]] functions from &lt;math&gt;[\![\sigma]\!] \,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;[\![\tau]\!] \,&lt;/math&gt;, with the pointwise ordering.
* A context &lt;math&gt;x_1 : \sigma_1, \; \dots, \; x_n : \sigma_n&lt;/math&gt; is interpreted as the product &lt;math&gt;[\![\sigma_1]\!] \times \; \dots \; \times [\![\sigma_n]\!]&lt;/math&gt;
* Terms in context &lt;math&gt;\Gamma \; \vdash \; x \; : \; \sigma&lt;/math&gt; are interpreted as continuous functions &lt;math&gt;[\![\Gamma]\!] \; \to \; [\![\sigma]\!]&lt;/math&gt;
** Variable terms are interpreted as projections
** Lambda abstraction and application are interpreted by making use of the [[cartesian closed]] structure of the category of domains and continuous functions
** '''Y''' is interpreted by taking the [[least fixed point]] of the argument

This model is not fully abstract for PCF; but it is fully abstract for the language obtained by adding a ''[[parallel or]]'' operator to PCF (p.&amp;nbsp;293 in the Hyland and Ong 2000 reference below).

'''Qanun''' is an Arabic word ({{lang-ar|قانون}}, ''qānūn''; {{lang-ota|قانون}}, ''kānūn'', derived from {{lang-grc|κανών}} ''kanōn'', which is also the root for the modern English word "[[canon law|canon]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|kanw/n|κανών|ref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Between God and the Sultan: A History of Islamic Law|author=Knut S.

It is thus frequently translated as "dynastic law". The idea of ''kanun'' first entered the Muslim World in the thirteenth century, as it was borrowed from the [[Mongol Empire]] in the aftermath of their invasions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Burak |first=Guy |title=The Second Formation of Islamic Law: The Ḥanafī School in the Early Modern Ottoman Empire |place=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2015 |isbn=978-1-107-09027-9 |pages=17–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 10th sultan of the Ottoman Empire, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Suleiman]] was known in the Ottoman Empire as Suleiman Kanuni ("the Lawgiver"), due to his code of laws. 

After the fall of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] in 1258, a practice known to the [[Turkish people|Turks]] and [[Mongols]] transformed itself into qanun, which gave power to [[caliphate|caliphs]], [[governor]]s, and sultans alike to "make their own regulations for activities not addressed by the sharia."&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"&gt;Berg, Herbert. "Islamic Law." Berkshire Encyclopedia of World History 3 (2005): 1030. In History Reference Center[database online]. Available from Snowden Library . Retrieved February 11, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This became increasingly important as the Middle East started to modernize, thus running into the problems of a modern state, which were not covered by sharia. The Qanun began to unfold as early as Umar I (586–644 CE).&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt; Many of the regulations covered by qanun were based on financial matters or tax systems adapted through the law and regulations of those territories Islam conquered.&lt;ref name = "Berg-TerrorLaw"/&gt;

The term ḳānūn derives itself from the Greek word κανών. Originally having the less abstract meaning of “any straight rod” it then later referred to any “measure or rule” in Greek. The word was then translated into and adopted by the Arabic language after the Ottoman Empire’s conquest of Egypt under Sultan [[Selim I]] (ca. 1516). In the Ottoman empire, the term ḳānūn still carried the word’s original meanings of a system of tax regulation. However, it later came to also refer to “code of regulations” or “state law”, a well-defined secular distinction to “Muslim law” known as the s̲h̲arīʿa. The ḳānūn took on significant importance during the period of modernization in the Ottoman Empire. The ḳānūn and s̲h̲arīʿa did not contradict each other concerning administrative matters, and therefore the ḳānūn was assimilated easily into Ottoman regulatory functions. The ḳānūn promulgated by Ottoman sultans also came to be used for financial and penal law. Under Sultan Mehmed II (1451-1481) the ḳānūn continued to be strictly applied for these practices. However due to the influence of [[Ebussuud Efendi|Abu ʾl-Suʿūd]], [[Grand Mufti|grand muftī]] of Istanbul from 1545 to 1574 the ḳānūn was applied to deal with matters concerning property rights as well. Previously, property rights were exclusively under the jurisdiction of the s̲h̲arīʿa. Despite this seeming contradiction, due to skillful bureaucratic operations, the ḳānūn and the s̲h̲arīʿa existed harmoniously. The ḳānūn has retained its relevance in the Middle East regarding civil, commercial, administrative, and penal laws that were inspired by originally Western legislation. It also has an influence in the ways that provisions of the s̲h̲arīʿa are reproduced.&lt;ref&gt;Linant de Bellefonds, Y., Cahen, Cl., İnalcık, Halil, and Ed. “Ḳānūn”.

Most scientists agree that [[religiosity]] is not an independent personality trait, but something that can have the effect of personality traits.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael C|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|year=2007|isbn=9780123741295|location=Oxford, UK|pages=260–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing religiosity through the lenses of differing personality characteristics provides a relatively empirical way to study a difficult concept. Over time, the act of being religious has been a consistent behavior across almost every culture, and thus provides evidence that our personality can help explain the seeming predisposition of religious people.

With the ability to use modern, empirically tested personality measures, researchers can link results with religiosity. In linking personality measures with religion, it is possible to quantitatively study results, which can provide insight into how and why religion is such an important element of being human.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion, Personality, and Social Behavior|year=2014|publisher=Psychology Press|location=New York|url=http://www.psypress.com/books/details/9781848726659/}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, more research is needed to definitively say that there is a correlation between certain personality characteristics and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by [[Raymond F. Paloutzian]], Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality |year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=253-2-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five-factor model of personality==
The [[five-factor model]] of personality is currently accepted as a comprehensive model of personality.&lt;ref name=Digman&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Digman | first1 = J.M. | year = 1990 | title = Personality structure: Emergence of the five-factor model | url = |journal = Annual Review of Psychology | volume = 41 | issue = | pages = 417–440 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.ps.41.020190.002221 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-factor model (FFM) identifies five broad traits underlying the many narrower traits that can be used to describe personality.  The identified traits are: 1) extraversion, the quantity and intensity of one's interpersonal interactions 2) neuroticism, the tendency to experience negative emotions such as anxiety, depression, and hostility 3) conscientiousness, the persistence, organization, and motivation exhibited in goal-directed behaviors 4) agreeableness, the quality of one's interpersonal interactions along a continuum from compassion to antagonism 5) openness, the proactive seeking and appreciation of new experiences. The idea behind the big five personality characteristics that makes them compatible to religious study is that each trait is orthogonal, or completely independent from one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Funder|first=David C.|title=The personality puzzle|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton|location=New York|isbn=9780393933482|pages=243–244|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In having the ability to separate each essential trait from the other, it is possible to study each personality characteristic and how it relates to religiosity.

The idea of studying the [[psychology of religion]] through a personality lens is not a new idea, however.  There has been research to both support and refute the ability of personality traits to explain religious or spiritual involvement. Research using [[Hans Eysenck|Eysenck]]'s model has found that religiosity in general is associated with low openness to experience, as well as low [[psychoticism]],&lt;ref name="psychology of religion"&gt;{{cite journal|first= Robert A.|last=Emmons|author2=Paloutzian, Raymond F. |title=The Psychology of Religion|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|year=2003|volume=54|pages=377–402|doi=10.1146/annurev.psych.54.101601.145024|pmid=12171998}}&lt;/ref&gt; a factor associated inversely with agreeableness and conscientiousness.&lt;ref name=Saroglou/&gt; A review of studies examined the relations between the FFM and measures of religiosity, spiritual maturity, religious fundamentalism, and extrinsic religion. General religiosity was mainly related to Agreeableness and Conscientiousness of the big five traits.&lt;ref name=Saroglou&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|title=Religion and the five-factors of personality: A meta-analytic review.|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|year=2002|pages=15–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, there was a weak positive association with extraversion, and a very small but significant relationship with low openness to experience. This same study also found that the two different concepts of religiosity and spirituality both involve an overall compassionate attitude towards others and positively correlates with agreeableness. Open, mature religiosity and spirituality were associated with high openness to experience, extraversion, agreeableness, and conscientiousness, and with low neuroticism. Religious fundamentalism was associated with higher agreeableness, and lower neuroticism and lower openness to experience. Because of these factors, it was also seen that more religious people seem to be altruistic and more well behaved. However, this correlation is pretty small. It is not known if religious people tend to be better behaved or if better behaved people are more attracted to religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Individual Differences and Personality|last=Ashton|first=Michael|publisher=Nikki Levy|year=2018|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|location=125 London Wall, London EC2Y 5AS, United Kingdom|pages=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extrinsic religiosity was associated with higher neuroticism but unrelated to the other personality factors. All of these relationships between personality and religion were small. This finding does not necessarily support the concept of personality for being the specific reason for religiosity, however this correlation with the FFM can lead to more in depth research on the topic.

===Strengths and weaknesses===
As previously stated, one of the major strengths for using the FFM to study religiosity in people is the how empirically tested, and accurate the measure actually is in accordance to personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=P|last2=McCrae|title=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|journal=The NEO PI-R Professional Manual|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another strength is that the big five is an excellent starting point for beginning to look at links between personality and religiosity because it is simply laid out. While this is a huge strength, some research argues that its downfall lies in that it is solely a personality indicator, and is not compatible with religious or spiritual matters.  For example, in another study that investigated the correlation between religiosity and the FFM, a conclusion was drawn that religiosity and/or spirituality should be made into a sixth personality factor in order to truly make research using this model accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piedmont|first=R|title=Strategies for using the five factor model of personality in religious research|journal=Journal of Psychology and Theology|volume=27|pages=338–350}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more advances in research using the FFM to study religiosity and spirituality come, there will be a clearer cut answer as to whether there is a significant place for the FFM in studying religious behavior.

==Attachment theory==
[[Attachment Theory]] is another example of a personality indicator with the ability to help researchers understand religiosity and spirituality.  The basic premise of attachment theory is that infants form relationships with their caregivers, and depending on the type of attachment, personality and future relationships will be influenced accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and loss: Separation, anxiety and anger|year=1973|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea behind how the theory relates to the psychology of religion is that these future relationships can be with the particular god, or higher power.

In attachment theory, there have been three attachment styles identified: 1)secure style- confidence in the availability of attachment figures during times of need 2)avoidant style- insecurity and lack of trust in the ability of others to care for one's needs 3) anxious-ambivalent style- view of others as being reluctant to get close to oneself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1-57230-922-9|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The research varies in explaining which type of attachment style yields the individual's particular relationship with God.  For example, in one study, a secure relationship with one's parents will translate into a secure attachment to God, and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=L|title=God as a substitute attachment figure: a longitudinal study of adult attachment style and religious change in college students.|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=1998|volume=24|pages=961–973|doi=10.1177/0146167298249004}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other research has showed that there is a compensatory effect, or the need of people to make up for something that is lacking.  For instance, someone with an insecure attachment style with their parents may in turn, have a very secure, and confident relationship with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Park|first=edited by Raymond F. Paloutzian, Crystal L.|title=Handbook of the psychology of religion and spirituality|year=2005|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|isbn=1572309229|pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
The idea of being able to link people's religiousness (or lack thereof) with how their attachment with their caregivers was, seems to be a promising field of study.  The obstacle that makes this seemingly simple idea very complicated is that the current data is so skewed.  There are many studies that found there is a direct correspondence from attachment style with caregivers to God, and there are studies who have found more compensatory results.  The inability of researchers to find a general consensus could be a hindrance towards future exploration in this field.

==Object relations theory==
[[Object relations theory]]'s roots lie in children relating or associating different emotions with different people (objects).  The children associate these emotions to the objects based on how they currently view the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kernberg|first=O|title=Structural derivatives of object relationships|journal=International Journal of Psycho-Analysis|pages=236–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, kids will associate the emotion of something good with mother, and bad with something like criminals.  In relating this with religious ideals, it seems natural that the same concept should apply.  One's relationship with God should, in theory, be traced back to association.

In this theory, it is hypothesized that the person ends up creating an idea of God according to what the individual needs, and how he or she perceives the world. This view of personality and religion does not focus on how each person differs trait wise, but it centers on the type of relationship the individual has with God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rizzuto|first=A|title=The birth of the living god|year=1979|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strengths and weaknesses===
An important notion to keep in mind with Object Relations theory is that it is highly theoretical.  This is a weakness in the sense that all data is based on a concept that cannot be objectively verified, and thus creates a confound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lilienfeld|first=S |author2=Wood, J |author3=Garb, H|title=The scientific status of projective tests|journal=Psychological Science in the Public Interest|year=2000|doi= 10.1111/1529-1006.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with all inquiries about the psychological nature of religion, it is difficult to find extremely valid and reliable measures because of the introspective nature of the subject.  That being said, there is something that we can learn from this field of study.  By analyzing how this theory of personality development correlates with one's attachment to a religious deity, we can hopefully begin to understand how important association, and perception is to religious ideals.

== Religious struggles and personality ==
Research has shown that struggles with religion correlates to basic personality traits. Studies on [[Big Five personality traits|The Big Five Factors of Personality]], as well as factors such as self-compassion, self-esteem, and entitlement, suggest that there is a significant relationship between religious uncertainty and personality.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;http://sites.nd.edu/lapseylab/files/2016/08/Grubbs_etal_SelfStruggleAndSoul_2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

People who are high in neuroticism may have a hard time trying to find purpose in their life. This correlates with divine struggles as they may encounter distress when it comes to finding the meaning of life as well as recognizing divine figures of religions. Extroversion, however, has not been linked through research or studies with religious struggles. Very little evidence is available to suggest that openness to experience is linked to religious struggles, but it is thought that those who are high in openness to experience may carry more doubt in religion compared to those who are lower in openness to experience. Both agreeableness and conscientiousness have been associated with possible animosity towards God or other divine figures.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;  It has also been found that religious people are more likely to avoid risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119916300013?via%3Dihub|title=Does local religiosity matter for bank risk-taking?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11166-013-9174-8|title=Risk aversion and religion}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion and life satisfaction ==
Research done by Salsman, Brown, Brechting, and Carlson showed a positive correlation between religion and life satisfaction of about 0.2 to 0.3. It was shown by Salsman that those who practice religion have a generally more positive outlook on life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Individual Differences in Personality|last1=Ashton|first1=Michael C|date=2018|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=978-0-12-809845-5|edition=Third|pages=310–311}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of religion have been studied to determine which aspects impacts one's life satisfaction. It was found that both personal and organizational religion can lead to an increased life satisfaction. Individual prayer, a feeling of intimacy with the divine, and meditation were all linked to greater psychological well-being and life satisfaction. When it came to organizational religion, people felt a greater satisfaction knowing that they belonged to a group, had a support system from the church, and felt fulfilled when they increased their participation within the church's community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elliot|first1=Marta|last2=Hayward|first2=R. David|date=October 1, 2009|title=Relgion and Life Satisfaction Worldwide: The Role of Government Regulation|url=https://academic.oup.com/socrel/article/70/3/285/1652126|journal=Sociology of Religion|volume=70|issue=3|pages=285–310|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who feel conflicted about religion may encounter a decline in their health, both mentally and physically. Research has shown that those who have religious struggles could have higher depression and anxiety levels. The risk of suicide is even elevated when struggle is present within religion. These struggles have been linked to a separation from the church or the divine; however the cause for the separation is unknown and may stem from different events throughout life such as a traumatic death in the family, difficult life events, or a mental battle between oneself. More research is needed to validate the causes of religious separation and how it effect one's personality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

== Religion and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator ==
The [[Myers-Briggs Type Indicator]], or MBTI, uses four dichotomies to indicate a person's psychological preference. When used in studies alongside religion, it has been shown that introverted types (primarily ISTJ and INTJ) are more likely to be atheist. However, a large portion of Greek Orthodox is ISTJ as well. In addition, the "judging" (J) type is common among evangelical and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scienceonreligion.org/index.php/news-research/research-updates/573-the-personality-types-of-christians-and-atheists&lt;/ref&gt;  ESFJ and ENFJ personality types are more interested in becoming ministers than other type. ENFJs are more attracted to becoming ministers of liberal denominations, while ESFJs are more interested in becoming ministers in conservative denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/j.2333-8504.1957.tb00074.x|title=EVIDENCE BEARING ON USE OF THE MYERS‐BRIGGS TYPE INDICATOR TO SELECT PERSONS FOR ADVANCED RELIGIOUS TRAINING: A PRELIMINARY REPORT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It should also be noted that the Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator, although popular, is flawed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pittenger|first1=David|title=Measuring the MBTI... And Coming Up Short|journal=Journal of Career Planning &amp; Placement|issue=Fall 1993|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~jobtalk/Articles/develop/mbti.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religiosity and paranormal beliefs ==
Most religions are based around a belief in some sort of supernatural being. This may lead some to believe that the characteristic of being religious would relate in someway to the characteristic of believing in other paranormal beings. However, multiple studies have found no correlation between these two characteristics. This could be due to the fact that many religions discourage their members from thinking too much of paranormal beings, as they are thought to be evil.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In conclusion, paranormal beliefs are probably not highly related to personality traits.

== Religion as a personality characteristic ==
While there are many who believe religion has a strong influence on personality development, some believe it may be a personality trait on its own. Vassilis Saroglou, for example,  has developed on the idea by introducing four traits of personality that religion develop: believing, bonding, behaving, and belonging. Believing refers to someone accepting the belief in a supernatural being or world. Bonding is how important religion is to the self and how it connects them to something larger than themselves. Behaving is how someone changes their own lifestyle to appease their spiritual beliefs. Belonging is the identity one acquires from believing in a religion. This concept, published in 2011, easily applies to religion cross-culturally and to a wide range of spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Saroglou|first=Vassilis|date=September 2, 2011|title=Believing, Bonding, Behaving, and Belonging - The Big Four Religious Dimensions and Cultural Variation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022022111412267|journal=Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology |volume=42|pages=1320–1340|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Salt tide''' is a phenomenon in which the lower course of a [[river]], with its low [[altitude]] with respect to the [[sea level]], becomes [[Seawater|salty]] when the discharge of the river is low during dry season, usually worsened by the result of astronomical high tide. 

The lower course [[Xijiang]] (''West River'') in [[Guangdong]], [[China]] was periodically affected and has been widely reported since 2004, for bringing shortage of fresh water supply to the western part of the [[Pearl River Delta]]. The salinity level of tap water at [[Zhuhai]] was reported to be as high as 800&amp;nbsp;mg per litre in late February 2006, more than 3 times higher than the [[World Health Organization]] standard of 250&amp;nbsp;mg.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24815">In [[computer science]] and [[mathematical logic]], the '''satisfiability modulo theories''' ('''SMT''') problem is a [[decision problem]] for logical formulas with respect to combinations of background [[Theory (mathematical logic)|theories]] expressed in classical [[first-order logic]] with equality. Examples of theories typically used in computer science are the theory of [[real numbers]], the theory of [[integers]], and the theories of various [[data structure]]s such as [[List (computing)|list]]s, [[Array data structure|arrays]], [[bit vector]]s and so on. SMT can be thought of as a form of the [[constraint satisfaction problem]] and thus a certain formalized approach to [[constraint programming]].

==Basic terminology==
Formally speaking, an SMT instance is a [[formula]] in [[first-order logic]], where some function and predicate symbols have additional interpretations, and SMT is the problem of determining whether such a formula is satisfiable. In other words, imagine an instance of the [[boolean satisfiability problem]] (SAT) in which some of the binary variables are replaced by [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s over a suitable set of non-binary variables. A predicate is basically a binary-valued function of non-binary variables. Example predicates include linear [[inequality (mathematics)|inequalities]] (e.g., &lt;math&gt;3x + 2y - z \geq 4&lt;/math&gt;) or equalities involving [[uninterpreted term]]s and function symbols (e.g., &lt;math&gt;f(f(u, v), v) = f(u, v)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is some unspecified function of two arguments). These predicates are classified according to each respective theory assigned. For instance, linear inequalities over real variables are evaluated using the rules of the theory of linear real [[arithmetic]], whereas predicates involving uninterpreted terms and function symbols are evaluated using the rules of the theory of [[uninterpreted function]]s with equality (sometimes referred to as the [[empty theory]]). Other theories include the theories of [[array data structure|arrays]] and [[List (computing)|list]] structures (useful for modeling and verifying [[computer program]]s), and the theory of [[bit vectors]] (useful in modeling and verifying [[hardware design]]s). Subtheories are also possible: for example, difference logic is a sub-theory of linear arithmetic in which each inequality is restricted to have the form &lt;math&gt;x - y &gt; c&lt;/math&gt; for variables &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; and constant &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;.

Most SMT solvers support only [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]-free fragments of their logics.

==Expressive power==
An SMT instance is a generalization of a [[Boolean satisfiability problem|Boolean SAT]] instance in which various sets of variables are replaced by [[predicate (mathematical logic)|predicate]]s from a variety of underlying theories. SMT formulas provide a much richer [[modeling language]] than is possible with Boolean SAT formulas. For example, an SMT formula allows us to model the [[datapath]] operations of a [[microprocessor]] at the word rather than the bit level.

By comparison, [[answer set programming]] is also based on predicates (more precisely, on [[atomic sentence]]s created from [[atomic formula]]).  Unlike SMT, answer-set programs do not have quantifiers, and cannot easily express constraints such as [[linear arithmetic]] or [[difference logic]]—ASP is at best suitable for boolean problems that reduce to the [[free theory]] of uninterpreted functions.  Implementing 32-bit integers as bitvectors in ASP suffers from most of the same problems that early SMT solvers faced: "obvious" identities such as ''x''+''y''=''y''+''x'' are difficult to deduce.

[[Constraint logic programming]] does provide support for linear arithmetic constraints, but within a completely different theoretical framework.

==Solver approaches==
Early attempts for solving SMT instances involved translating them to Boolean SAT instances (e.g., a 32-bit integer variable would be encoded by 32 bit variables with appropriate weights and word-level operations such as 'plus' would be replaced by lower-level logic operations on the bits) and passing this formula to a Boolean SAT solver. This approach, which is referred to as ''the eager approach'', has its merits: by pre-processing the SMT formula into an equivalent Boolean SAT formula we can use existing Boolean SAT solvers "as-is" and leverage their performance and capacity improvements over time. On the other hand, the loss of the high-level semantics of the underlying theories means that the Boolean SAT solver has to work a lot harder than necessary to discover "obvious" facts (such as &lt;math&gt;x + y = y + x&lt;/math&gt; for integer addition.) This observation led to the development of a number of SMT solvers that tightly integrate the Boolean reasoning of a [[DPLL algorithm|DPLL]]-style search with theory-specific solvers (''T-solvers'') that handle [[Logical conjunction|conjunctions]] (ANDs) of predicates from a given theory. This approach is referred to as ''the lazy approach''.

| issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; this architecture gives the responsibility of Boolean reasoning to the DPLL-based SAT solver which, in turn, interacts with a solver for theory T through a well-defined interface. The theory solver only needs to worry about checking the feasibility of conjunctions of theory predicates passed on to it from the SAT solver as it explores the Boolean search space of the formula. For this integration to work well, however, the theory solver must be able to participate in propagation and conflict analysis, i.e., it must be able to infer new facts from already established facts, as well as to supply succinct explanations of infeasibility when theory conflicts arise. In other words, the theory solver must be incremental and [[Backtracking|backtrackable]].

==SMT for undecidable theories==
Most of the common SMT approaches support [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] theories. However, many real-world systems can only be modelled by means of non-linear arithmetic over the real numbers involving [[transcendental function]]s, e.g. an aircraft and its behavior. This fact motivates an extension of the SMT problem to non-linear theories, e.g. determine whether

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{array}{lr}
&amp; (\sin(x)^3 = \cos(\log(y)\cdot x) \vee b \vee -x^2 \geq 2.3y) \wedge \left(\neg b \vee y &lt; -34.4 \vee \exp(x) &gt; {y \over x}\right)
\end{array}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

: &lt;math&gt;b \in {\mathbb B}, x,y \in {\mathbb R}&lt;/math&gt;

is satisfiable. Then, such problems become [[undecidable problem|undecidable]] in general.  (It is important to note, however, that the theory of [[real closed field]]s, and thus the full first order theory of the [[real number]]s, are [[Decidability (logic)|decidable]] using [[quantifier elimination]].  This is due to [[Alfred Tarski]].)  The first order theory of the [[natural numbers]] with addition (but not multiplication), called [[Presburger arithmetic]], is also decidable.  Since multiplication by constants can be implemented as nested additions, the arithmetic in many computer programs can be expressed using Presburger arithmetic, resulting in decidable formulas.

Examples of SMT solvers addressing Boolean combinations of theory atoms from undecidable arithmetic theories over the reals are ABsolver,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==Applications==
SMT solvers are useful both for verification, proving the correctness of programs, software testing based on symbolic execution, and for synthesis, generating program fragments by searching over the space of possible programs.

===Verification===
Computer-aided [[formal verification|verification of computer programs]] often uses SMT solvers. A common technique is to translate preconditions, postconditions, loop conditions, and assertions into SMT formulas in order to determine if all properties can hold.

There are many verifiers built on top of the [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3 Z3] SMT solver. [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/boogie/ Boogie] is an intermediate verification language that uses Z3 to automatically check simple imperative programs. The [http://vcc.codeplex.com VCC] verifier for concurrent C uses Boogie, as well as [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/dafny/ Dafny] for imperative object-based programs, [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/chalice/ Chalice] for concurrent programs, and [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/specsharp/ Spec#] for C#. [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/fstar/ F*] is a dependently typed language that uses Z3 to find proofs; the compiler carries these proofs through to produce proof-carrying bytecode. The [http://viper.ethz.ch Viper verification infrastructure] encodes verification conditions to Z3. The [https://hackage.haskell.org/package/sbv sbv] library provides SMT-based verification of Haskell programs, and lets the user choose among a number of solvers such as Z3, ABC, Boolector, CVC4, MathSAT and Yices.

There are also many verifiers built on top of the [http://alt-ergo.ocamlpro.com/ Alt-Ergo] SMT solver. Here is a list of mature applications:
* [http://why3.lri.fr/ Why3], a platform for deductive program verification, uses Alt-Ergo as its main prover;
* CAVEAT, a C-verifier developed by CEA and used by Airbus; Alt-Ergo was included in the qualification DO-178C of one of its recent aircraft;
* [[Frama-C]], a framework to analyse C-code, uses Alt-Ergo in the Jessie and WP plugins (dedicated to "deductive program verification");
* [[SPARK (programming language)|SPARK]], uses CVC4 and Alt-Ergo (behind GNATprove) to automate the verification of some assertions in SPARK 2014;
* [[B-Method|Atelier-B]] can use Alt-Ergo instead of its main prover (increasing success from 84% to 98% on the [http://alt-ergo.lri.fr/documents/ABZ-2014.pdf ANR Bware project benchmarks]);
* [[Rodin tool|Rodin]], a B-method framework developed by Systerel, can use Alt-Ergo as a back-end;
* [http://cubicle.lri.fr/ Cubicle], an open source model checker for verifying safety properties of array-based transition systems.
* [https://www.easycrypt.info/ EasyCrypt], a toolset for reasoning about relational properties of probabilistic computations with adversarial code.

Many SMT solvers implement a common interface format called [http://smt-lib.org/ SMTLIB2] (such files usually have the extension "&lt;tt&gt;.smt2&lt;/tt&gt;"). The [https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/ LiquidHaskell] 
tool implements a refinement type based verifier for Haskell that can use any SMTLIB2 compliant solver, e.g. CVC4, MathSat, or Z3.

===Symbolic-execution based analysis and testing===

An important application of SMT solvers is [[symbolic execution]] for analysis and testing of programs (e.g., [[concolic testing]]), aimed particularly at finding security vulnerabilities. Important actively-maintained tools in this category include [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/pg/public_psfiles/ndss2008.pdf SAGE] from [[Microsoft Research]], [https://klee.github.io/ KLEE], [http://s2e.epfl.ch/ S2E], and [https://triton.quarkslab.com Triton]. SMT solvers that are particularly useful for symbolic-execution applications include [https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3 Z3], [https://sites.google.com/site/stpfastprover/ STP], [https://sites.google.com/site/z3strsolver/ Z3str2], and [http://fmv.jku.at/boolector/ Boolector].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10936">Promoting recovery from [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]] is not limited to simply a [[humanitarian]], security or development issue and often involves a combination of all three. '''Stabilization of fragile states''' is an approach and a process regarding the fragility and security of said states. Hence, stabilization is an essential concept in relation to fragile and [[failed states]], where basic institutions and services are lacking and where conflict is an influential factor. [[OECD]] uses the term from fragility to resilient to describe the process of stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;OECD From fragility to resilience: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/62/9/41212290.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Stabilization processes are a multisectoral effort, requiring a variety different instruments that seek to secure the basic needs of the [[population]] and support the development of [[state-building]] to ensure the process is sustainable and builds stronger and more legitimate states These actions are primarily taken by western [[government]]s and national actors often involving a combination of military, political, development and humanitarian objectives, resources and activities to tackle transnational and domestic threats through short term [[security]] promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding: http://graduateinstitute.ch/webdav/site/ccdp/shared/6305/Workshop%20Report-Stabilisation%20_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical logic for international engagement ==
Stabilization, as it is currently articulated and implemented by the [[United States|US]] and other Western governments, is premised on an assumption that weak [[governance]], instability, violent conflict and associated [[poverty]] and underdevelopment pose a direct threat to their strategic interests and international peace and security more broadly. This is because ‘islands of instability’ are seen as constituting sources of regional insecurity and contagion, particularly in their association with [[international terrorism]], [[transnational crime]] and other real and existential threats.&lt;ref&gt;AFRICA SECURITY BRIEF: http://africacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/AfricaBrief-6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  While stabilization is firmly rooted in security agendas focused on reducing or eliminating perceived threats, accumulated experience of international intervention and engagement to end conflicts and foster [[peace]] and development over the past decade has emphasized the need to integrate military, political, development and humanitarian action. In contexts as diverse as [[Afghanistan]], [[Haiti]] and [[Timor-Leste]], stabilization has emerged therefore as a key instrument of a broader liberal, transformative peace-building project. As such, it extends beyond short-term or conservative objectives to eliminate immediate threats or merely to ‘stabilize’ temporarily situations of acute crisis to link action across a range of discrete policy spheres with the aim of reducing violence and establishing the political and social conditions necessary for recovery, reconstruction, development and a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Collinson et al. 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4881&amp;title=states-fragility-stabilisation-its-implications-humanitarian-action States of fragility: stabilisation and its implications for humanitarian action]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] by:/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalia, a failed state with no functioning government and with most of the country being controlled by [[Insurgency|insurgents]], is an example of stabilization efforts. For fear of [[Somalia]] becoming a safe haven for terrorist and thus destabilizing the region and threatening the global society, international actors have engaged through [[counter-insurgency]] as a stabilization strategy to remove the insurgents and make Somalia a resilient state for the benefit of Somalis and the [[international security]].

== Policy dimensions ==

=== Security, development and institutional transformation ===
Security and development share a close but complex connection and successful international humanitarian and development stakeholders in [[fragile state]]s must understand and engage the security issues in areas they operate.&lt;ref name=ODI3&gt;Vicki Metcalfe, Ellen Martin and Sara Pantuliano 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5415&amp;title=stability-humanitarian-action-security-development-fragile-states Risk in humanitarian action: towards a common approach?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an understanding has been reached by  donors such as [[DFID]], the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]] and [[USAID]] and they have all been involved in security sector reform and efforts to improve justice, from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] to [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Timor-Leste]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Yet these efforts have often been limited in their success as a balance security and development is difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;  The [[UK]] government supported reforms in [[Sierra Leone]] along the principle of "security first" over the last decade, which is believed to have improved security, increased access to and the quality of justice, decreased corruption and positively reformed public service.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Since the end of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war in 2002]], there has been no majo violence, [[Sierra Leone election, 2007|peaceful elections]] were held in 2007 and there has been enough stability to help build sustainable institutions.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Yet Sierra Leone suffers severe underdevelopment and ranks third to last on the [[UN Human Development Index]] for 2010. This in turn has created frustration and disappointment amongst the younger generation and poses a significant risk of a return to violence.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

=== The role of informal actors and the changing nature of violence ===
Violence does not end simply with the signing of a [[peace agreement]] and often the rates of criminal and [[domestic violence]] have actually risen afterwards.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Addressing national issues that led to conflict or that might trigger conflict again and efforts to improve the state's own security capacity is only two factors in achieving citizens’ security and [[social cohesion]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; The peace process itself may lead to insecurity as [[demobilisation]] of armed groups leave armed, social excluded and frustrated individuals free to continue violence informally. Insecurity can be increased by informal actors, as well as regional and international drivers of instability, such as [[organised crime]], [[drug smuggling]] and [[Illegal arms trafficking]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Organised crime's capacity to undermine state authority and basic [[law enforcement]] is well known in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; In [[Guatemala]], impunity provided as part of the [[Conflict resolution|peace process]] since 1996, following a [[Guatemalan Civil War|30-year civil war]], has allowed former members of the state security apparatus in charge of repression new opportunities for criminal activity.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; [[Mexico]] suffers critical levels of [[Mexico drug war|drug-related violence]] that has led to over 10,000 gang killings in 2010, up from just under 6,600 in 2009; the gangs often command more resources than the state. Building state-society relations and trust are central to the process of combating such violence.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

=== The political dimension ===
Each state and society emerging from conflict have their own specific interplay of sub-national, national, regional and international drivers of insecurity and effective international engagement in fragile states requires a comprehensive understanding of local politics.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; [[Political economy]] and [[conflict analysis]] are increasingly used as a starting point for development and humanitarian strategies. Inclusive political settlements to conflict require agreements to be reached between both elites and their constituencies.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; This process may be complicated not only by an interest in continuing conflict by particular groups and that the elites may be part of the reason for the conflicts initiative (for instance, by marginalising particular groups in their constituency), but also that key political leaders are necessary to ensure effective dialogue.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Stabilisation is not a linear process from conflict to peace and rather represents a lengthy and extensive process that is characterised by power struggles and elite bargaining. Elections and the development of democratic institutions requires a lengthy process for the development of political parties and independent electoral commissions and international community expectations for quick wins or 'ideal' governance reforms must be accordingly tempered.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

The process of stabilizing fragile states is often tied with [[Wikipedia:Good governance#cite note-:0-7|good governance]] and [[Wikipedia:Public service|public service]] delivery for constituents and international development partners.  Post-conflict states face higher challenges in delivering public service and good governance when compared to non-post-conflict counterparts due to reduced state capacity in reform implementation, the absence of human capital, the presence of donor organizations, and legacy local governing systems. For example, in post-conflict Sierre Leonne, public service delivery bypassed weak civil service institutions through donor-led aid projects in fields such as healthcare delivery.  The resulting formation of parallel mechanisms arrives at the cost of building state capacity and citizen accountability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. “Public Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.” World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pre-conflict governance structures with traditional or administrative authority, such as the control held by Afghan warlords, historically weaken the delivery of public service and good governance in local regions with a De Jure-De Facto Gap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Alternatively, well-meaning international attempts to enable good governance can be manipulated by governing regimes to potentially prompt further disorder toward neighbors and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grindle|first=Merilee S.|date=2007|title=Good Enough Governance Revisited|url=|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=25 (5)|pages=553–574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7843">The '''stick-slip phenomenon''', also known as the '''slip-stick phenomenon''' or simply '''stick-slip''', is the spontaneous jerking motion that can occur while two objects are sliding over each other.

== Cause ==
Below is a simple, [[heuristic]] description of stick-slip phenomena using [[classical mechanics]] that is relevant for engineering descriptions. However, in actuality, there is little consensus in academia regarding the actual physical description of stick-slip which follows the lack of understanding about friction phenomena in general. The generally agreed upon view is that stick-slip behavior results from common [[phonon]] modes (at the interface between the substrate and the slider) that are pinned in an undulating potential well landscape that un-pin (slip) and pin (stick) primarily influenced by thermal fluctuations.

The stiffness of the spring (shown in image below), the [[Normal (geometry)|normal]] load at the interface (the weight of the slider), the duration of time the interface has existed (influencing chemical mass transport and bond formation), the original rate (velocity) of sliding (when the slider is in the slip phase) – all influence the behavior of the system.&lt;ref&gt;F. Heslot, T. Baumberger, B. Perrin, B. Caroli, and C. Caroli, Phys. Rev. E 49, 4973 (1994)

Sliding Friction: Physical Principles and Applications – Bo N.J. Persson

Ruina, Andy. "Slip instability and state variable friction laws." Journal of Geophysical Research 88.B12 (1983): 10359-10
&lt;/ref&gt; A description using common phonons (rather than constitutive laws like Coulomb's friction model) provides explanations for noise that generally accompanies stick-slip through surface acoustic waves. The use of complicated constitutive models that lead to discontinuous solutions (see [[Painlevé paradox]]) end up requiring unnecessary mathematical effort (to support non-smooth dynamical systems) and do not represent the true physical description of the system. However, such models are very useful for low fidelity simulations and animation.

'''Engineering description'''

Stick-slip can be described as surfaces alternating between sticking to each other and sliding over each other, with a corresponding change in the force of [[friction]]. Typically, the [[static friction]] coefficient (a heuristic number) between two surfaces is larger than the [[kinetic friction]] coefficient.  If an applied [[force]] is large enough to overcome the static friction, then the reduction of the friction to the kinetic friction can cause a sudden jump in the velocity of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kligerman|first1=Y.|last2=Varenberg|first2=M.|date=2014|title=Elimination of stick-slip motion in sliding of split or rough surface|journal=Tribology Letters|volume=53|issue=2|pages=395–399|doi=10.1007/s11249-013-0278-8|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11249-013-0278-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attached picture shows symbolically an example of stick-slip.

[[File:Stick-slip.svg|500px]]

V is a drive system, R is the elasticity in the system, and M is the load that is lying on the floor and is being pushed horizontally. When the drive system is started, the Spring R is loaded and its pushing force against load M increases until the static friction coefficient between load M and the floor is not able to hold the load anymore. The load starts sliding and the friction coefficient decreases from its static value to its dynamic value. At this moment the spring can give more power and accelerates M. During M’s movement, the force of the spring decreases, until it is insufficient to overcome the dynamic friction. From this point, M decelerates to a stop. The drive system however continues, and the spring is loaded again etc.

== Examples ==
Examples of stick-slip can be heard from [[hydraulic cylinders]], tractor wet brakes, honing machines etc. Special [[Dopant|dopes]] can be added to the [[hydraulic fluid]] or the cooling fluid to overcome or minimize the stick-slip effect. Stick-slip is also experienced in lathes, mill centres, and other machinery where something slides on a slideway. Slideway oils typically list "prevention of stick-slip" as one of their features. Other examples of the stick-slip phenomenon include the music that comes from [[Bow (music)|bowed instruments]], the noise of [[car]] [[brakes]] and [[tires]], and the noise of a stopping [[train]]. Stick-slip also has been observed in articular cartilage in mild loading and sliding conditions, which could result in an abrasive wear of the cartilage.&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Lee, X. Banquy, J. N. Israelachvili, ''Stick-slip friction and wear of articular joints'', PNAS. (2013), 110(7): E567-E574&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another example of the stick-slip phenomenon occurs when musical notes are played with a [[glass harp]] by rubbing a wet finger along the rim of a crystal wine glass.  One animal that produces sound using stick-slip friction is the [[spiny lobster]] which rubs its antennae over smooth surfaces on its head.&lt;ref name="Patek"&gt;{{cite journal |author=S. N. Patek |year=2001 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=411 |pages=153–154 |title=Spiny lobsters stick and slip to make sound |doi=10.1038/35075656 |pmid=11346780 |issue=6834}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another, more common example which produces sound using stick-slip friction is the [[grasshopper]].

Stick-slip can also be observed on the [[atom]]ic scale using a [[friction force microscope]].&lt;ref&gt;'' Atomic-scale friction of a tungsten tip on a graphite surface '' C.M. Mate, G.M. McClelland, R. Erlandsson, and S. Chiang [[Phys. Rev. Lett.]] '''59''', 1942 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt; In such case, the phenomenon can be interpreted using the [[Tomlinson model]].

The behaviour of seismically-active [[Fault (geology)|faults]] is also explained using a stick-slip model, with [[earthquakes]] being generated during the periods of rapid slip.&lt;ref name="Scholz"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scholz|first=C.H.|title=The mechanics of earthquakes and faulting|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JL1VM5wMbrQC&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=6 December 2011|edition=2|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-65540-8|pages=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristic sound of [[basketball]] [[shoe]]s squeaking on a [[Basketball court|court]] is produced by stick-slip contact between the [[Natural rubber|rubber]] soles and the [[hardwood]] floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/sports/ncaabasketball/squeaky-shoes-hardwood.html|title=Why Are Basketball Games So Squeaky?

Stick-slip is the basic physical mechanism for the active control of friction by applying vibrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Popov|first=M.|last2=Popov|first2=V. L.|last3=Popov|first3=N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4590">The '''Sussex Manifesto''' was a report on science and technology for development written at the request of the [[United Nations]] and published in 1970.

== History ==

In the late 1960s the United Nations asked for recommendations on science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/science/psd/un_unesco.pdf The rise and fall of S&amp;T on the UN agenda - 60 years of UN and UNESCO, Professor Dr Klaus-Heinrich Standke   Science and Public Policy,  November 2006  ]&lt;/ref&gt; from a team of academics at the [[Institute of Development Studies]] (IDS) and [[SPRU]] [[Science and Technology Policy Research]] (formerly called [[Science Policy Research Unit]]) at the [[University of Sussex]], UK.  This team became known as the Sussex Group and their report, ''Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade'', became known as the ''Sussex Manifesto''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/wp-content/uploads/The-Sussex-Manifesto-IDS-Reprint.pdf The Sussex Manifesto: Science and Technology to Developing Countries during the Second Development Decade]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' was intended as the introductory chapter to the ''UN World Plan of Action on Science and Technology for Development''. But the solutions presented in the Manifesto were deemed too radical to be used for that purpose.  It was instead published in 1970 as an annex in ''Science and Technology for Development: Proposals for the Second United Nations Development Decade'', a UN report by the Advisory Committee on the Application of Science and Technology to Development (ACAST).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/sici?sici=0192-5121(1982)3%3A3%3C343%3ASATITN%3E2.0.CO%3B2-K ACAST and the introduction of science and technology into the UN system]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Sussex Manifesto'' helped raise awareness of science and technology for development &lt;ref&gt;[http://sss.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/8/3/385.pdf  Science, Technology and Development: Part of a course in Development Studies for first and second year engineering and medical students at the University of Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania, David Wield and Carol Barker, Social Studies of Science 1978; 8; 385]&lt;/ref&gt; in UN circles &lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=134280&amp;set=487E2528_2_7&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1 UNESCO’s contribution to Stage 2 of the World Plan of Action for the Application of Science and Technology to Development; science and technology policies and institutions],&lt;/ref&gt; influenced the design of development institutions and was used for teaching courses in both North and South universities.

The Sussex Group were [[Hans Singer]] (Chairman), Charles Cooper (Secretary), R.C. Desai, [[Christopher Freeman]], Oscar Gish, Stephen Hill and Geoffrey Oldham.

== Today ==

In 2008 one of the authors of the original report Professor Geoff Oldham gave a seminar &lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/event/steps-new-manifesto-seminar-geoff-oldham/ Professor Oldham's STEPS Seminar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ids.ac.uk/news/news-at-ids-the-sussex-manifesto IDS News]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[STEPS Centre]] – a research centre and policy engagement based at IDS and SPRU. Following this event the STEPS Centre decided to create a new manifesto in association its partners around the world and Professor Oldham. The new publication, ''Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/wp-content/uploads/steps-manifesto_small-file.pdf Innovation, Sustainability, Development: A New Manifesto]&lt;/ref&gt; was launched in 2010, forty years after the original.

The New Manifesto has also been translated into Chinese, French, Portuguese and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://steps-centre.org/anewmanifesto/publications/manifesto-translated-into-chinese-french-portuguese-and-spanish/ New Manifesto: translated versions]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The STEPS Centre is funded by the [[Economic and Social Research Council]] (ESRC).

'''Technology assessment''' ('''TA''', German: {{lang|de|Technikfolgenabschätzung}}, French: {{lang|fr|évaluation des choix scientifiques et technologiques}}) is a scientific, interactive, and communicative process that aims to contribute to the formation of public and political opinion on societal aspects of science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the commonly used definition given in the report of the EU-funded project TAMI (Technology Assessment – Methods and Impacts) in 2004: [http://www.ta-swiss.ch/?uid=45 ta-swiss.ch]&lt;/ref&gt;

== General description ==

TA is the study and evaluation of new technologies. It is based on the conviction that new developments within, and discoveries by, the scientific community are relevant for the world at large rather than just for the scientific experts themselves, and that technological progress can never be free of ethical implications. Also, technology assessment recognizes the fact that scientists normally are not trained [[ethicist]]s themselves and accordingly ought to be very careful when passing ethical judgement on their own, or their colleagues, new findings, projects, or work in progress.

Technology assessment assumes a global perspective and is future-oriented, not anti-technological. TA considers its task as an interdisciplinary approach to solving already existing problems and preventing potential damage caused by the uncritical application and the commercialization of new technologies.

Therefore, any results of technology assessment studies must be published, and particular consideration must be given to communication with political decision-makers.

An important problem concerning technology assessment is the so-called [[Collingridge dilemma]]: on the one hand, impacts of new technologies cannot be easily predicted until the technology is extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a technology is difficult as soon as it is widely used.

Technology assessments, which are a form of [[cost–benefit analysis]], are difficult if not impossible to carry out in an objective manner since subjective decisions and value judgments have to be made regarding a number of complex issues such as (a) the boundaries of the analysis (i.e., what costs are internalized and externalized), (b) the selection of appropriate indicators of potential positive and negative consequences of the new technology, (c) the monetization of non-market values, and (d) a wide range of ethical perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 8, "The Positive Biases of Technology Assessments and Cost Benefit Analyses", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, most technology assessments are neither objective nor value-neutral exercises but instead are greatly influenced and biased by the values of the most powerful stakeholders, which are in many cases the developers and proponents (i.e., corporations and governments) of new technologies under consideration. In the most extreme view, as expressed by Ian Barbour in  '’Technology, Environment, and Human Values'’, technology assessment is "a one-sided apology for contemporary technology by people with a stake in its continuation."&lt;ref&gt;Barbour, I.A. (1980). ''Technology, environment, and human values'', Praeger, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the major fields of TA are: information technology, [[hydrogen technologies]], [[nuclear technology]], [[molecular nanotechnology]], [[pharmacology]], [[organ donation|organ transplant]]s, [[biotechnology|gene technology]], [[artificial intelligence]], the Internet and many more. [[Health technology assessment]] is related, but profoundly different, despite the similarity in the name.

===Forms and concepts of technology assessment===
The following types of concepts of TA are those that are most visible and practiced. There are, however, a number of further TA forms that are only proposed as concepts in the literature or are the label used by a particular TA institution.&lt;ref&gt;Among those concepts one finds, for instance, '''Interactive TA''' [http://www.itas.fzk.de/deu/tadn/tadn298/rath298a.htm ITAS.fzk.de], '''Rational TA''' [http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html EA-AW.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918235522/http://www.ea-aw.com/the-europaeische-akademie/aimstasks.html |date=September 18, 2010 }}, '''Real-time TA''' (cp. Guston/Sarewitz (2002) Real-time technology assessment, in: Technology in Society 24, 93–109), Innovation-oriented TA [http://www.innovationsanalysen.de Innovationsanalysen].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Parliamentary TA (PTA)''': TA activities of various kinds whose addressee is a parliament. PTA may be performed directly by members of those parliaments (e.g. in France and Finland) or on their behalf of related TA institutions (such as in the UK, in Germany and Denmark) or by organisations not directly linked to a Parliament (such as in the Netherlands and Switzerland).&lt;ref&gt;Those TA institutions that perform PTA are organised in the [[European Parliamentary Technology Assessment]] (EPTA) network; see [http://eptanetwork.org EPTAnetwork.org].&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Expert TA''' (often also referred to as the '''classical TA''' or '''traditional TA''' concept): TA activities carried out by (a team of) TA and technical experts. Input from stakeholders and other actors is included only via written statements, documents and interviews, but not as in participatory TA.
* '''Participatory TA (pTA)''': TA activities which actively, systematically and methodologically involve various kinds of social actors as assessors and discussants, such as different kinds of civil society organisations, representatives of the state systems, but characteristically also individual stakeholders and citizens (lay persons), technical scientists and technical experts. Standard pTA methods include consensus conferences, focus groups, scenario workshops etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cp. the 2000 EUROpTA (European Participatory Technology Assessment – Participatory Methods in Technology Assessment and Technology Decision-Making) project report [http://www.tekno.dk/pdf/projekter/europta_Report.pdf TEKNO.dk].&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes pTA is further divided into '''expert-stakeholder pTA''' and '''public pTA''' (including lay persons).&lt;ref&gt;Van Eijndhoven (1997) Technology assessment: Product or process? in: Technological Forecasting and Social Change 54 (1997) 269–286.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Constructive TA (CTA)''': This concept of TA, developed in the Netherlands, but also applied&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://run.unl.pt/handle/10362/31566|title=Battery storage systems as balancing option in intermittent renewable energy systems - A transdisciplinary approach under the frame of Constructive Technology Assessment. PhD Thesis|last=Baumann|first=Manuel Johann|last2=|publisher=Universidade Nova de Lisboa|year=2017|isbn=|location=Lisbon|pages=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; and discussed elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Schot/Rip (1997), The Past and Future of Constructive Technology Assessment in: Technological Forecasting &amp; Social Change 54, 251–268.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to broaden the design of new technology through feedback of TA activities into the actual construction of technology. Contrary to other forms of TA, CTA is not directed toward influencing regulatory practices by assessing the impacts of technology. Instead, CTA wants to address social issues around technology by influencing design practices.
* '''Discursive TA''' or '''Argumentative TA''': This type of TA wants to deepen the political and normative debate about science, technology and society. It is inspired by ethics, policy discourse analysis and the sociology of expectations in science and technology. This mode of TA aims to clarify and bring under public and political scrutiny the normative assumptions and visions that drive the actors who are socially shaping science and technology. Accordingly, argumentative TA not only addresses the side effects of technological change, but deals with both broader impacts of science and technology and the fundamental normative question of why developing a certain technology is legitimate and desirable.&lt;ref&gt;van Est/Brom (2010) Technology assessment as an analytic and democratic practice, in: Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Health TA (HTA)''': A specialised type of expert TA informing policy makers about efficacy, safety and cost effectiveness issues of pharmaceuticals and medical treatments, see [[health technology assessment]].

'''Trinity University''' is a [[Private university|private]] [[liberal arts college]] in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]]. Founded in 1869, its campus is located in the [[Monte Vista Historic District]] adjacent to [[Brackenridge Park]]. The campus is three miles north of downtown San Antonio and the [[San Antonio River Walk|River Walk]] and six miles south of the [[San Antonio International Airport]]. The student body consists of approximately 2,300 undergraduate and 200 graduate students. Trinity offers 42 [[College major|majors]] and 57 minors among 6 degree programs&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"/&gt; and has an endowment of $1.24 billion, the 85th largest in the country,&lt;ref name=NACUBO/&gt; which permits it to provide resources typically associated with much larger colleges and universities.

Trinity is a member institution of the [[Annapolis Group]], a consortium of national independent colleges that share a commitment to [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts values and education]], and the [[Associated Colleges of the South]], 16 southern liberal arts colleges that collaborate on staff and curricular enhancements.

== History ==
[[File:Trinity University Banner.jpg|left|thumb|175px|Trinity University Banner]]
[[Cumberland Presbyterian Church|Cumberland Presbyterian]]s founded Trinity in 1869 in [[Tehuacana, Texas]]  from the remnants of three small Cumberland Presbyterian colleges that had lost significant enrollment during the [[Texas in the Civil War|Civil War]]. [[John Boyd (Texas Congressman)|John Boyd]], who had served in the [[Congress of the Republic of Texas]] from 1836 to 1845 and in the [[Texas Senate]] from 1862 to 1863, donated 1,100 acres of land and financial assistance to establish the new university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Cecil, Jr. |last=Harper |title=BOYD, JOHN |encyclopedia=Handbook of Texas Online |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fbo59 |date=2010-06-12 |publisher=[[Texas State Historical Association]] |access-date=2014-10-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Elizabeth LeNoir |last=Jennett |title=Biographical Directory of the Texan Conventions and Congresses, 1832-1845 |date=1942 |pages=54–55 |url=http://www.lrl.state.tx.us/scanned/members/bios/Bio_Directory_Texas_Convs_Congresses_1832-1845.pdf#page=49 |access-date=2015-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Second Trinity University Campus 1.JPG|250px|thumb|Former Trinity University campus in [[Waxahachie, Texas]]]]
Believing that the school needed the support of a larger community, the university moved in 1902 to [[Waxahachie, Texas]]. In 1906, the university, along with many Cumberland Presbyterian churches, affiliated with the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|United Presbyterian Church]]. The [[Stock Market Crash of 1929]], however, severely hindered the university's growth. Enrollment declined sharply, indebtedness and faculty attrition mounted, and trustees began using endowment funds to maintain daily operations. Consequently, the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] placed Trinity's accreditation status on probation in 1936, jeopardizing its future. Once again, its leaders began to consider relocation to a larger community to improve the university's viability.

Meanwhile, in 1942, the [[Methodist Church (USA)|Methodist]]-affiliated [[University of San Antonio]] was failing. San Antonio community leaders, who wished to maintain a [[Protestant]]-affiliated college in the city, approached Trinity with a relocation offer. The university left Waxahachie and took over the campus and alumni of the University of San Antonio. (The old Waxahachie campus is currently home to [[Southwestern Assemblies of God University]]). For the next decade the Woodlawn campus, on the city's near-west side, was Trinity's home while it developed a permanent home. Lacking adequate facilities, the university functioned by using military [[barracks]] and [[Quonset hut]]s to house students and to provide library and classroom space.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/trinity-history |title=Trinity University History |website=Trinity University |access-date=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Trinity acquired a former [[limestone]] [[quarry]] for a new campus and hired Texas [[architect]] [[O'Neil Ford]] to design a master plan and many of the buildings. Construction began in 1950, and the current campus opened in 1952.

When it moved, the campus was largely undeveloped (one classroom building, one dorm, and a nearly empty library were the only completed buildings).&lt;ref name=history/&gt; Yet, under the leadership of Dr. James W. Laurie, the university's 14th president, Trinity took advantage of its new location in a rapidly growing major urban center to grow in academic stature.  Dr. Laurie was responsible for drastically increasing Trinity's endowment, largely funded by the [[James A. Chapman|James A. and Leta M. Chapman]] Charitable Trust of [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=Donald E. |last=Everett |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/kbt32| title=TRINITY UNIVERSITY |encyclopedia=The Handbook of Texas Online| publisher=Texas State Historical Association |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rogersandbell.com/Trusts.aspx |title=Chapman Charitable Trusts - Preserving the Legacy of the Chapman Trusts |website=Rogers and Bell |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The stronger endowment allowed Trinity to construct a new, modern campus on its “University on the Hill” location and to increase the quality and range of its faculty while maintaining a high faculty to student ratio. In 1969 Trinity entered into a covenant agreement with the regional synod of the [[Presbyterian Church (USA)]] that affirmed historical connections, but transformed Trinity into a private, independent university with a self-perpetuating board of trustees. The campus continues to be a "historically connected" member of the [[Association of Presbyterian Colleges and Universities]].

Trinity's growth continued under Ronald Calgaard, who followed Laurie's successor, Duncan Wimpress. Under Dr. Calgaard, the university implemented a number of changes to raise its profile. For example, Trinity transformed into a residential undergraduate school, requiring all freshmen to live on campus and cutting the number of master's programs offered from more than twenty to four. As well, Trinity decreased its student population from about 3,300 to 3,000 (and eventually to 2,700), increased merit scholarships, increased the focus on national student recruitment, and began scheduling a strong series of speakers and cultural events open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617073736/http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1987_454397/trinity-university-stakes-its-future-on-recruiting.html|title=Trinity University stakes its future on recruiting intelligence 04/05/1987 - Archives - Chron.com - Houston Chronicle|date=17 June 2012|website=Web.archive.org|accessdate=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Calgaard's successor, [[John R. Brazil]], focused on replacing outdated campus buildings and improving the school's financial resources.  The "Campaign for Trinity University", which launched in September 2005, sought to raise US $200 million for a variety of purposes.  At its conclusion on September 25, 2009, the Campaign raised $205.9 million, surpassing the original goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |date=2009-09-25 |title=Trinity University’s Capital Campaign Totals $205.9 Million |publisher=Trinity University |accessdate=2010-11-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120222024740/http://www.trinity.edu/departments/development/campaign/news_events/0909_campaign_conclusion.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Brazil served as Trinity's President in through January 2010. Upon announcement of his retirement, the Board of Trustees awarded him Trinity's Distinguished Service Award, Trinity's most prestigious honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090123brazilretire.htm |title=Trinity University President Announces Retirement in 2010 |publisher=Trinity University |date=2009-01-23 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dennis A. Ahlburg]] served as president from January 2010 to January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |first=Sharon Jones |last=Schweitzer  |url=http://www.trinity.edu/departments/public_relations/news_releases/090925_ahlburg.htm |title=Trinity University Selects 18th President |publisher=Trinity University |date=2009-09-25 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Ahlburg's presidency, Trinity developed and executed a strategic plan to shape the future of the university. Academically, Trinity refined its curriculum in order to further define a liberal arts education, developed an entrepreneurship program, and realigned the business program. As well, Trinity refocused its marketing to raise the university's national profile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 | title=University President to Step Down in 2015 | publisher=Trinity University | date=2014-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, under Ahlburg, Trinity built the Center for Sciences and Innovation, which modernized and combined science facilities to ease collaboration across disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://new.trinity.edu/news/university-president-step-down-2015 |title=University President to Step Down in 2015|publisher=Trinity University |date=May 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Strategic plan ===
In 2011, Trinity undertook the development of a comprehensive ten-year strategic plan, ''Trinity Tomorrow'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://strategicplan.trinity.edu/|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Tomorrow |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure the long-term sustainability of the university. The board of trustees approved the plan in May 2013, which details four strategic objectives:
*Strengthen opportunities for experiential learning
*Foster productive collisions as a defining characteristic
*Enhance students international engagement and awareness
*Maximize the educational and personal benefits of a residential liberal arts university

and four foundations in order to achieve them:
*Strengthen market position and improve student recruitment
*Be an innovative leader for excellence in teaching and research
*Improve alumni relations, engagement, and giving
*Build the infrastructure to support a 21st-century university

Administrators have begun enacting the details of the plan with positive outcomes. Among other highlights, Trinity:
*adopted a new curriculum;
*increased its marketing locally and nationally; 
*launched centers to focus on college success, experiential learning and career preparedness, and international citizenship;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/news/trinity-launches-three-strategic-centers|website=Trinity University |title=Trinity Launches Three Strategic Centers |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and
*launched the Tiger Network&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://new.trinity.edu/live|website=Trinity University |title=Tiger Network |date= |accessdate=2015-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase access to campus events via the Internet.

== Academics and rankings ==
[[File:Trinity University Sign.png|thumb|150px|left]]
As defined by the [[Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education|Carnegie Foundation]]'s classification, Trinity University is a small, highly residential university with a majority of enrollments coming from undergraduate students. The full-time, four-year undergraduate program is classified as "more selective, lower transfer-in" and has an arts and sciences focus with some graduate student coexistence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://carnegieclassifications.iu.edu/lookup_listings/view_institution.php?unit_id=229267 |title=Trinity University |website=Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Learning |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools and is a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]]. Full-time undergraduate tuition is $39,560; room and board are $12,754 for 2016-2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://new.trinity.edu/admissions-aid/tuition-fees |title=Tuition &amp; Fees |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2016-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academics ===
Trinity offers 47 majors and 59 minors in the traditional [[liberal arts]], business, [[Natural science|sciences]], [[fine arts]], and [[engineering]], and graduate programs in [[accounting]], [[teaching]], [[school psychology]], [[Academic administration|school administration]], and [[health care|health care administration]].&lt;ref name="Fast Facts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/about-us/fast-facts |title=Fast Facts |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trinity stresses close interaction between students and faculty members across all disciplines, with a 9:1 student/faculty ratio. The full-time faculty numbers 228, 98% of whom hold a [[Ph.D]]. or other terminal degree in their field.  About 47% of the student body has studied abroad, in over 35 countries.

All undergraduates must demonstrate proficiency across a broad range of academic disciplines, regardless of major. At its core, the Common Curriculum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inside.trinity.edu/student-success/advising/common-curriculum |website=Inside Trinity |title=Common Curriculum |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the liberal arts foundation for all undergraduate degrees awarded by Trinity. The Common Curriculum consists of the following components:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x28972.xml |title=Courses of Study 2013-14 |website=Trinity University |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The First-Year Experience (FYE) Program'''''
Starting in fall 2015, all first-year students must complete a 6-credit hour course in their first semester that meets five days a week. The FYE consists of a writing workshop, discussion seminar, and a common day where everyone from the different sections meet for guest speakers, student conferences, or library sessions to assist students in the research process.

'''''Foreign Language, Computer, and Mathematics Skills'''''
*Foreign Languages 
Trinity students must reach a minimum level of competence corresponding to that attained after successful completion of the first semester of the second year of college foreign language study. Students may waive this requirement if they completed the appropriate high school courses. An international baccalaureate course at standard level with a 6 or 7 will suffice. 
*Computer Skills
Students must be able to use computers to collect, organize, analyze and communicate information in an academic environment. Students who do not pass a test demonstrating these competencies must fulfill this requirement by completing an approved course built around these criteria.
*Mathematics 
Trinity requires completion of three years of high school mathematics, including either trigonometry or precalculus, for admission as a first-year student. While there is no further requirement, all students are urged to undertake further study of mathematics at Trinity.

40 percent of students attend graduate school immediately after earning their bachelor's, and 65 percent of all students attend within five years of graduation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121033620/http://web.trinity.edu/Documents/student_affairs_docs/Career_Services_docs/Data/11_Graduating_Student_Survey.pdf |date=January 21, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis by the Office of Institutional Research indicated that Trinity has made considerable progress in the number of graduates going on to earn doctoral degrees. Of students earning a bachelor's between 1982 and 1986, 2.9% went on to earn doctorates; of those earning a bachelor's between 1997 and 2001, 8.5% had. Trinity improved its ranking in this category from 328th to 38th among other colleges and universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.trinity.edu/x402.xml |website=Trinity University |title=Office of Institutional Research |date= |accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity fields strong teams, evidenced by its finishes in the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] (NACDA) Learfield Directors' Cup, which recognizes the strength of athletic programs by division. Since the Directors' Cup inception in 1995, Trinity has finished in the top 10 on five occasions out of over 400 [[NCAA Division III|Division Ill]] programs; it finished 31st in 2017-18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/2017-18/misc_non_event/May31overallDIII_final.pdf |title=Directors' Cup Division III Final Standings|website=NACDA |date=2018-05-31 |accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trinity has historically had a strong [[tennis]] program. In 1963, Al G. Hill, Jr, grandson of oilman H L Hunt, entered as a Freshman Tennis Player.  When he graduated in 1967 as Tiger Captain, the College Tennis Courts were named after him.

Approximately 50 sessions were held over five days. About 85 presenters from around the world conducted sessions on a variety of current concerns in astrophysics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Santa Cruz Galaxy Workshop|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/GalaxyWorkshop2013.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=University of California, Santa Cruz|accessdate=7 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Annual Summer School in Computational Astrophysics ===

UC-HiPACC supports an annual international advanced school aimed at graduate students and postdocs who are currently working in or actively interested in doing research in AstroComputing. Topics and locations of the annual school rotate among the UC campuses and national laboratories, and  [[Caltech]] and [[Stanford]] also participate. Lectures from summer school sessions are posted on the UC-HiPACC website so that they can be useful worldwide. During these schools, students are afforded direct access to some of the largest supercomputers in the world for running their own simulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Summer School on AstroComputing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/SummerSchool.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2010 Summer School ====

The first UC-HiPACC summer school was held in July 2010 on the campus of UC Santa Cruz where students learned about the main software models currently used in high resolution simulations of galaxy formation and evolution. In labs, students worked on projects using these codes, supervised by the lecturers. The summer school was directed by [http://astronomy.nmsu.edu/dept/html/directory.faculty.aklypin.shtml Anatoly Klypin], [[New Mexico State University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2010 International Summer School on Astro-Computing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/html/2010SummerSchool_archive.html|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2011 Summer School ====

In 2011, 28 grad students — 17 from outside California — gathered at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory to learn about Explosive Astrophysics. The focus was on computational explosive astrophysics, including the modeling of core collapse and thermonuclear supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, neutron star mergers, and other energetic transients. Workshops guided students in running and visualizing simulations on supercomputers using codes such as FLASH, CASTRO, GR1D and modules for nuclear burning and radiation transport. The conference was organized by [http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/kasen.html Daniel Kasen] and [https://archive.is/20140113104528/http://astro.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/nugent.html Peter Nugent] of UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Labs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 International Summer School on Astro on AstroComputing|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/html/ISSAC_Home.php|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=10 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2012 Summer School ====

=== Cosmological Simulations ===

Large cosmological simulations are now the basis for much current research on the structure of the universe and the evolution of galaxies and clusters of galaxies. “Numerical simulations have become ... one of the most effective tools
to study and to solve astrophysical problems.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Lauro |last1=Moscardini |first2=Klaus |last2=Dolag|title=Cosmology with numerical simulations|url=http://icc.ub.edu/~liciaverde/IC/como.pdf|work=Institute of Sciences of the Cosmos|publisher=Universitat de Barcelona|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers associated with UC-HiPACC are deeply involved in the two projects described below, which are relevant to UC-HiPACC’s mission to promote UC computational astrophysics. The HiPACC website is hosting the Bolshoi website. The UCSC AstroComputing system Hyades, including the [[Huawei]] 1 [[Petabyte|PetaByte]] AstroData system, will be hosting many of Bolshoi simulation outputs.

=== Education of Public and Other Outreach ===

As UC-HiPACC states on its website, “A crucial goal of UC-HiPACC outreach is to give the fruits of UC computational astrophysics research back to the taxpaying public through formal (classroom) and informal (extracurricular) education.”&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

Activities include the preparation by UC-HiPACC staff of articles to help astronomers reach classroom students and teachers and collaboration with planetaria, science museums, and other organizations that reach the astronomy-interested general public. Planetarium shows for which UC-HiPACC members have contributed astronomical computations and images include “Life: A Cosmic Story” in the 75-foot dome of the [[Morrison Planetarium]] in [[San Francisco]], and “Deep Space Adventure” in the 71-foot 8000 pixel-across dome of the [[Adler Planetarium]] in [[Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Morrison Planetarium|title=Life, A Cosmic Story, credits tab, Science Data and Simulations |url=http://www.calacademy.org/academy/exhibits/planetarium/life/|publisher=California Academy of Sciences|accessdate=13 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UC-HiPACC staff creates and posts to its website approximately monthly “AstroShorts”—illustrated capsule stories about especially interesting work in computational astronomy around the UC-HiPACC consortium, designed for use in the newsletters of astronomical societies, science clubs, newspapers, or other outlets.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt; The website’s “Press Room” publishes press releases on computational astronomy from around the UC-HiPACC consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/PressRoom.php|title=HiPACC Press Room |work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A visualization from the Bolshoi Cosmological Simulation, the most detailed cosmological simulation run to date, was narrated in the [[National Geographic Channel|National Geographic]] TV special ''Inside the Milky Way''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Excerpts from "Inside the Milky Way", produced by National Geographic TV|url=http://hipacc.ucsc.edu/Bolshoi/Movies.html#insideMW|work=University of California High-Performance AstroComputing Center|publisher=UC Santa Cruz|accessdate=9 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
UC-HiPACC  provided footage from the Bolshoi Simulation to the Icelandic performer [[Björk]] for her musical number “Dark Matter” for her [[Biophilia (album)|Biophilia]] concert.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

The organization conducts outreach to raise funds to support the activities described in this article.&lt;ref name=Outreach/&gt;

'''''Verstehen''''' ({{IPA-de|fɛɐˈʃteːən}}, literally: "to understand"), in the context of German philosophy and [[social science]]s in general, has been used since the late 19th century – in English as in German – with the particular sense of the "interpretive or participatory" examination of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |title=Verstehen: The Sociology of Max Weber |access-date=2011-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110307133502/http://www.faculty.rsu.edu/~felwell/Theorists/Weber/Whome.htm |archive-date=2011-03-07 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is closely associated with the work of the German [[sociologist]], [[Max Weber]], whose [[antipositivism]] established an alternative to prior [[sociological positivism]] and [[economic determinism]], rooted in the analysis of [[social action]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm "Anti-positivism"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403001519/http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/anti_positivism.htm |date=April 3, 2012 }} at Historylearningsite.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; In [[anthropology]], ''Verstehen'' has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture attempts to relate to it and understand others. 

''Verstehen'' is now seen as a concept and a method central to a rejection of positivistic social science (although Weber appeared to think that the two could be united). ''Verstehen'' refers to understanding the [[Meaning-making|meaning]] of action from the actor's point of view. It is entering into the shoes of the other, and adopting this research stance requires treating the actor as a subject, rather than an object of your observations. It also implies that unlike objects in the natural world human actors are not simply the product of the pulls and pushes of external forces. Individuals are seen to create the world by organizing their own understanding of it and giving it meaning. To do research on actors without taking into account the meanings they attribute to their actions or environment is to treat them like objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bitbucket.icaap.org/dict.pl?term=VERSTEHEN "Verstehen"]: entry in the ''Online Dictionary of the Social Sciences''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meaning&lt;!--'Interpretative sociology', 'Interpretative sociology' and 'Verstehende Soziologie' redirect here--&gt;==
'''Interpretative sociology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''verstehende Soziologie'') is the study of society that concentrates on the meanings people associate to their social world.&lt;ref name="Sociology"&gt;Macionis, J., and Gerber, L. (2010). Sociology, 7th edition&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretative sociology strives to show that reality is constructed by people themselves in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

''Verstehen'' roughly translates to "meaningful understanding" or "putting yourself in the shoes of others to see things from their perspective". Interpretive sociology differs from positivist sociology in three ways:
#Interpretive sociology deals with the meaning attached to behavior, unlike positivist sociology which focuses on action. 
#Interpretive sociology sees reality as being constructed by people, unlike positivist sociology which sees an objective reality "out there". 
#Interpretive sociology relies on qualitative data, unlike positivist sociology which tends to make use of quantitative data.&lt;ref name="Sociology" /&gt;

==Dilthey and hermeneutics==
''Verstehen'' was introduced into philosophy and the [[human science]]s (''[[Geisteswissenschaften]]'') by the German [[Historism|historist]] philosopher [[Johann Gustav Droysen]]. He first made a distinction between nature and history in terms of the categories of space and time. The method of the [[natural sciences]] (''Naturwissenschaften'') is explanation (''[[wikt:erklären|erklären]]&lt;!--German verb--&gt;''), while that of history is understanding (''verstehen&lt;!--German verb--&gt;'').&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Historik: Vorlesungen über Enzyklopädie und Methodologie der Geschichte''. Stuttgart: Fromann-Holzboog, [1858] 1977: 22, 150f.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droyen, ''Grundriss der Historik'', Berlin 1862, p. 4 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Gustav Droysen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7_lrAAAAIAAJ&amp;hl= ''Grundriss der Historik''], Verlag von Veit &amp; Comp., 1868, p. 11: §14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lars Udehn, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lu4rCkENQvcC&amp;dq= ''Methodological Individualism: Background, History and Meaning''], Routledge, 2001, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Verstehen'' was later used by the German philosopher [[Wilhelm Dilthey]]&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Ideen über eine beschreibende und zergliedernde Psychologie'', Berlin 1894, p. 1314.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. Dilthey, ''Introduction to the Human Sciences''. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the first-person participatory perspective that agents have on their individual experience as well as their culture, history, and society. In this sense, it is developed in the context of the theory and practice of ''interpretation'' (as understood in the context of [[hermeneutics]]) and contrasted with the external objectivating third-person perspective of ''explanation'' (''das Erklären'') in which human agency, subjectivity, and its products are analyzed as effects of impersonal natural forces in the natural sciences and social structures in sociology.

Twentieth-century philosophers such as [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hans-Georg Gadamer, ''[[Truth and method]]'', Crossroad, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; have been critical of what they considered to be the romantic and subjective character of ''Verstehen'' in Dilthey, although both Dilthey and the early Heidegger were interested in the "[[facticity]]" and "life-context" of understanding, and sought to universalize it as the way humans exist through language on the basis of [[ontology]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Heidegger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bcOjTiSNFZoC&amp;dq= ''Ontology: The Hermeneutics of Facticity''], Indiana University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles R. Bambach, [https://books.google.com/books?id=xaWALY0raiEC&amp;dq= ''Heidegger, Dilthey, and the crisis of historicism''], Cornell University Press, 1995, p. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' also played a role in [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Alfred Schutz]]'s analysis of the "[[lifeworld]]." [[Jürgen Habermas]] and [[Karl-Otto Apel]] further transformed the concept of ''Verstehen'', reformulating it on the basis of a transcendental-pragmatic philosophy of language and the theory of communicative action.

==Weber and the social sciences==
[[Max Weber]] and [[Georg Simmel]]&lt;ref&gt;Georg Simmel, ''Die probleme der Gechichtsphilosophie. Eine erkentnistheoretische Studie''. Munich: Verlag von Dunker und Humboldt, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt; introduced interpretive understanding (''Verstehen'') into [[sociology]], where it has come to mean a systematic interpretive process in which an outside observer of a culture (such as an [[anthropologist]] or [[sociologist]]) relates to an indigenous people or sub-cultural group on their own terms and from their own point of view, rather than interpreting them in terms of his or her own culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Verstehen'' can mean either a kind of [[Empathy|empathic]] or participatory understanding of social phenomena. In anthropological terms this is sometimes described as [[cultural relativism]], especially by those that have a tendency to argue toward universal ideals. In sociology it is an aspect of the comparative-historical approach, where the context of a society like twelfth century "France" can be potentially better understood (''Besserverstehen'') by the sociologist than it could have been by people living in a village in Burgundy. It relates to how people in life give meaning to the social world around them and how the [[social scientist]] accesses and evaluates this "first-person perspective". This concept has been both expanded and criticized by later social scientists. Proponents laud this concept as the only means by which researchers from one culture can examine and explain behaviors in another. While the exercise of ''Verstehen'' has been more popular among social scientists in [[Europe]], such as Habermas, ''Verstehen'' was introduced into the practice of [[sociology]] in the [[United States]] by [[Talcott Parsons]], an American follower of [[Max Weber]]. Parsons used his [[structural functionalism]] to incorporate this concept into his 1937 work, ''The Structure of Social Action''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gerber|first=John J. Macionis, Linda M.|title=Sociology|publisher=Pearson Canada|location=Toronto|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|edition=7th Canadian|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weber had more specific beliefs than Marx where he put value to understanding and meaning of key elements—not just with intuition or sympathy with the individual but also the product of "systematic and rigorous research". The goal is to identify human actions and interpreting them as observable events leading us to believe that it not only provides for a good explanation for individual actions but also for group interactions. The meaning attached needs to include constraints and limitations and analyze the motivation for action. Weber believed that this gives the sociologist an advantage over a natural scientist because "We can accomplish something which is never attainable in the natural sciences, namely the subjective understanding of the action of the component individuals" (Weber, Economy and Society, p.&amp;nbsp;15).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gingrich|first=Paul|title=Max Weber|url=http://uregina.ca/~gingrich/s30f99.htm|work=Sociology 250|publisher=University of Regina, Department of Sociology and Social Studies|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics of the social scientific concept of ''Verstehen'' such as [[Mikhail Bakhtin]] and [[Dean MacCannell]] counter that it is simply impossible for a person born of one culture to ever completely understand another culture, and that it is arrogant and conceited to attempt to interpret the significance of one culture's [[symbol]]s through the terms of another (supposedly superior) culture.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Such criticisms do not necessarily allow for the possibility that ''Verstehen'' does not involve "complete" understanding.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Just as in physical science all knowledge is asymptotic to the full explanation, a high degree of cross-cultural understanding is very valuable. The opposite of ''Verstehen'' would seem to be ignorance of all but that which is immediately observable, meaning that we would not be able to understand any time and place but our own. A certain level of interpretive understanding is necessary for our own cultural setting, however, and it can easily be argued that even the full participant in a culture does not fully understand it in every regard.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Critics also believe that it is the sociologist's job to not just observe people and what people do but also share in their world of meaning and come to appreciate why they act as they do. Subjective thoughts and feelings regarded as bias in the sciences is an important aspect to be controlled for while doing sociological research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Macionis, Gerber|first=John, Linda|title=Sociology|year=2011|publisher=Pearson Canada Inc.|location=Toronto, ON|isbn=978-0-13-700161-3|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''White power music''' is music that promotes [[white nationalism]]. It encompasses various music styles, including [[rock music|rock]], [[country music|country]], experimental music and [[folk music|folk]].&lt;ref name=Messner&gt;Messner, Beth A., Art Jipson, Paul J. Becker and Bryan Byers. 2007.[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a782004590 "The Hardest Hate: A Sociological Analysis of Country Hate Music: From Rebel Records to Prussian Blue: A History of White Racialist Music in the United States"]. ''Popular Music and Society''. 30(4):513-531.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; Ethnomusicologist [[Benjamin R. Teitelbaum]] argues that white power music "can be defined by lyrics that demonize variously conceived non-whites and advocate racial pride and solidarity. Most often, however, insiders conceptualized white power music as the combination of those themes with pounding rhythms and a charging punk or metal-based accompaniment."&lt;ref&gt;Teitelbaum, Benjamin R. "Saga's Sorrow: Femininities of Despair in the Music of Radical White Nationalism. Ethnomusicology 58(3). {{jstor|10.5406/ethnomusicology.58.3.0405}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genres include [[Nazi punk]], [[Rock Against Communism]], and [[National Socialist black metal]].&lt;ref name=pulera&gt;Pulera, Dominic J.,''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America'',  pp. 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;

Barbara Perry writes that contemporary white supremacist groups include "subcultural factions that are largely organized around the promotion and distribution of racist music."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, Barbara, ''Hate Crimes'' (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2009) {{ISBN|0-275-99569-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-275-99569-0}}, pp. 51-2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission]] "racist music is principally derived from the far-right skinhead movement and, through the Internet, this music has become perhaps the most important tool of the international neo-Nazi movement to gain revenue and new recruits."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hreoc.gov.au/racial_discrimination/cyberracism/examples.html "Racist Music: Publication, Merchandising and Recruitment"], ''[[Cyber racism]]'' ,Race Discrimination Unit, HREOC, October 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rooney, Anne, ''Race Hate''(Evans Brothers, 2006), {{ISBN|0-237-52717-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-237-52717-4}}, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;  An article in ''Popular Music and Society'' says "musicians believe not only that music could be a successful vehicle for their specific ideology but that it also could advance the movement by framing it in a positive manner."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;

Dominic J. Pulera writes that the music is more pervasive in some countries in Europe than it is in the United States, despite some European countries banning or curtailing its distribution.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; European governments regularly deport "extremist aliens", ban white power bands and raid ''organizations'' that produce and distribute the music.&lt;ref name=pulera/&gt; In the United States, racist music is protected [[freedom of speech in the United States]] by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].&lt;ref name=eatwell&gt;Eatwell, Roger and Cas Mudde, ''Western democracies and the new extreme right challenge'' (Psychology Press, 2004) {{ISBN|0-415-36971-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-415-36971-8}}, pp. 54-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Country music has spawned several subgenres, including white racist country music — also referred to as ''segregationist music'' — which came about in response to the [[Civil rights movement#Civil rights movement in the United States|American civil rights movement]].&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone, 2000a, 2002b.&lt;/ref&gt; The songs expressed resistance to the federal government and civil rights advocates who were challenging well-established white supremacist practices endemic in the  [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; There were also changes in the music recording industry in the 1940s and 1950s that allowed regional recording companies to form across the United States, addressing small specialized markets.&lt;ref name="Tucker, 1985"&gt;Tucker, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; B.C. Malone writes: "the struggles waged by black Americans to attain economic dignity and racial justice provided one of the ugliest chapters in country music history, an outpouring of racist records on small labels, mostly from [[Crowley, Louisiana]], which lauded the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and attacked [[African American]]s in the most vicious of stereotypical terms."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone (2002a), p. 317.&lt;/ref&gt;

The artists often adopted [[pseudonym]]s, and some of their music was "highly confrontational, making explicit use of [[List of ethnic slurs|racial epithets]], [[stereotype]]s and threats of [[violence]] against civil rights activists.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Much of the music "featured blatantly racist [[Stereotypes of African Americans|stereotypes that dehumanized African Americans]]", equating them with [[animal]]s or "using cartoonish imagery associated with "[[List of ethnic slurs|Jigaboos]]"".&lt;ref&gt;Messner, Becker, Jipson, and Byers (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Lyrics warned of "white violence" on African Americans if they insisted on being treated as equals.&lt;ref name="Messner, et al., 2007"&gt;Messner, et al., 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Other songs were [[dog-whistle politics|more subtle]], couching racist messages behind social critiques and political action calls.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; The lyrics, in the tradition of [[right-wing populism]], questioned the legitimacy of the federal government and rallied whites to protect "Southern rights" and traditions.&lt;ref name="Messner, et al., 2007"/&gt;  The song "[[Black Power]]" includes the lyrics:
{{quote|The ones who shout "Black Power" / Would bury you and me. / Yeah, the ones who shout "Black Power" / Should let our country be... / White men stand together and register to vote. / Don’t let them take way our land. / We’ve still got lots of hope.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;}}

===Reb Rebel Records===
In 1966, businessman Jay "J.D." Miller created a niche record label for his company, the defiantly [[Racial segregation|segregationist]] Reb Rebel Records. It was arguably the most notable of the racist country music record labels.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tucker, 1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Herman, 2006"&gt;Herman, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Reb Rebel released 21 singles and ''For Segregationists Only'', an album of its ten  bestselling songs, four of which were Johnny Rebel's.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broven"&gt;Broven, John, ''South to Louisiana: The Music of the Cajun Bayous'' (Gretna, Louisiana: Pelican, 1983) p. 252, {{ISBN|0-88289-608-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The label's first single, "Dear Mr. President" (referring to then-president [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]), by Happy Fats (Leroy Leblanc), sold more than 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Herman, 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; The song parodied Johnson's [[Great Society]] programs, which aimed to eliminate [[poverty]] and racial injustice.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; Other songs were primarily about [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]] or the [[Vietnam War]], "but they never really attacked [[black people]]."&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; The studio's second release, "Flight NAACP 105" by "the Son of Mississippi" (Joe Norris), was the label's bestseller; the track was a "spontaneous skit in the vein of ''[[Amos 'n' Andy]]''."&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; It was the first in a series of "highly racist take-offs" of ''Amos n’ Andy''.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Few of Miller's racist records were played on the radio in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malone (2002b) and Pittman (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johnny Rebel===
[[Johnny Rebel (singer)|Johnny Rebel]], the pseudonym that Cajun country musician Clifford Joseph Trahane used on racist recordings issued in the 1960s, became the "forefather of white power music."&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Broven"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cajuns"&gt;Bernard, Shane K.,''The Cajuns: Americanization of a People'' (Jackson, Miss: University Press of Mississippi, 2003) p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnny Rebel's six [[Single (music)|singles]] (12 songs altogether), frequently use the racial epithet ''[[nigger (word)|nigger]]'', and often voiced sympathy for [[racial segregation]] and the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK), such as his first B-side "Kajun Ku Klux Klan", which was a "cautionary tale centered on the story of 'Levi Coon' who dared to demand that he be served in a café."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pittman, 2003; Johnny Rebel – Klassic Klan Kompositions.&lt;/ref&gt; The songs were "vehemently anti-black, its pro-segregationist lyrics set to the twangs of the era's swampbilly craze."&lt;ref name="Pittman"&gt;Pittman, Nick, "[https://web.archive.org/web/20071112091023/geocities.com/pittman1978/rebeltimes.html Johnny Rebel Speaks: The true-to-life story of how a South Louisiana man with a guitar and a belief became a forefather of white power music.]", in: ''Times of Acadiana'', [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], ca. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of bootlegged records and Internet interest, Johnny Rebel's career never ended; in the late 1990s he was rediscovered, and he re-released his music on CD and promoted it with his own website.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; The site, however, did not spark new interest outside his fanbase until [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; Johnny Rebel recorded and released "Infidel Anthem", about "the whipping America should lay on Osama bin Laden," leading to an appearance on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', where his new compilation CD and the new song were promoted.&lt;ref name="Pittman"/&gt; At the time, Stern's show had a peak audience of around 20 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Condran | first = Ed | title = Stern Producer Flourishes By The Skin Of His Teeth | publisher = ''[[The Morning Call]]'' |date= July 31, 1998 | url = https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/32538396.html?dids=32538396:32538396&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+31%2C+1998&amp;author=ED+CONDRAN+%28A+free-lance+story+for+The+Morning+Call%29&amp;pub=Morning+Call&amp;desc=STERN+PRODUCER+FLOURISHES+BY+THE+SKIN+OF+HIS+TEETH&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = James | first = Renee A. | title = Hmmm?

Michael Wade argues that Johnny Rebel "influenced British racist musicians, notably the band [[Skrewdriver]], which inspired other right-wing musicians."&lt;ref&gt;Wade, Michael, "Johnny Rebel and the Cajun Roots of Right-Wing Rock". ''Popular Music and Society''(2007) 30(4), 493-512. {{doi|10.1080/03007760701546364}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==White power rock==
[[Nazi punk]] music is stylistically similar to most forms of [[punk rock]], although it differs by having lyrics that express hatred of [[Jew]]s, [[Homosexuality|homosexuals]], [[communism|communists]], [[anarchism|anarchists]], [[anti-racism|anti-racists]] and people who are not considered [[white people|white]], as opposed to the often left-wing lyrics of punk rock. In 1978 in [[United Kingdom|Britain]], the [[White nationalism|white nationalist]] [[National Front (United Kingdom)|National Front]] (NF) had a punk-oriented youth organization called the Punk Front.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon. ''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Punk Front only lasted one year, it included a number of [[White supremacy|white power]] punk bands such as The Dentists, The Ventz, Tragic Minds and White Boss.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, Simon.''Rip It Up and Start Again: Postpunk 1978-1984.'' Penguin (Non-Classics), 2006. p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabin, Roger. ''Punk Rock: So What?: The Cultural Legacy of Punk.'' Routledge, 1999. pp. 207-208.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nazi punk subculture appeared in the [[United States]] by the early 1980s during the rise of the [[hardcore punk]] scene.&lt;ref&gt;Andersen, Mark. ''Dance of Days: Two Decades of Punk in the Nation's Capital.'' Akashic Books, 2003. p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Michael. ''Globalizing the Streets.'' Columbia University Press, 2008. p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Rock Against Communism]] movement originated in the [[United Kingdom]] in late 1978 with  activists associated with the NF. The most notable RAC band was [[Skrewdriver]], which started out as a non-political punk band but evolved into a [[white power skinhead]] band after the original lineup broke up and a new lineup was formed.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;*{{cite web|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/skrewdriverinterview.htm |title=Skrewdriver- A Fan's View |publisher=Punk77.co.uk |date=|accessdate=31 August 2010}}.&lt;br&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/skrewdrivecuttings.htm |title=Skrewdriver- Press Cuttings |publisher= Punk77.co.uk |date= |accessdate=31 August 2010}}.&lt;br&gt;[http://www.skrewdriver.net/diamond.html Diamond in the Dust - The Ian Stuart Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They were the "most dominant white racial extremist band" and were idealized in the "emerging movement that arose in response to perceptions of political liberalism, diversity, and the loss of a power in the white community."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Skrewdriver advocated on behalf of [[Far-right politics|extreme right-wing]] and racist politics, and its frontman [[Ian Stuart Donaldson]] identified himself as a [[History of British fascism since 1945|British neo-Nazi]].&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; The group performed mainly for other white power skinheads and "asserted the need for extremist political violence."&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt; Bands that followed their lead also "fused racist ideology, heavy metal and hard rock styles", embracing "aggressive [[racism]] and [[ethnic nationalism]]".&lt;ref name=Messner/&gt;

[[National Socialist black metal]] (NSBM) is [[black metal]] that promotes [[Nazism|National Socialist (Nazi)]] beliefs through their lyrics and imagery. These beliefs often include: [[white supremacy]], [[racial segregation|racial separatism]], [[antisemitism]], [[heterosexism]], and Nazi interpretations of [[Germanic neopaganism|paganism]] or [[Theistic Satanism|Satanism]] ([[Nazism and occultism|Nazi mysticism]]). According to Mattias Gardell, NSBM musicians see "national socialism as a logical extension of the political and spiritual dissidence inherent in black metal.&lt;ref name="Gardell"&gt;Mattias Gardell, [[Gods of the Blood|''Gods of the Blood'' (2003)]], p.307&lt;/ref&gt; Bands whose members hold Nazi beliefs but do not express these through their lyrics are generally not considered NSBM by black metal musicians, but are labelled as such in media reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bifff-berlin.de/aktuell72.html ''Rechtes Neuheiden-Festival mit Nazi-Runen im "SO 36"'']&lt;/ref&gt; Some black metal bands have made references to [[Nazi Germany]] purely for [[shock value]], much like some [[punk rock]] and [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands. According to Christian Dornbusch and Hans-Peter Killguss, [[Neo-völkisch movements|völkisch]] [[pagan metal]] and neo-Nazism are the current trends in the black metal scene, and are affecting the broader metal scene.&lt;ref&gt;Unheilige Allianzen, page 290&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mattias Gardell]], however, sees NSBM artists as a minority within black metal.&lt;ref name="Gardell"/&gt;
