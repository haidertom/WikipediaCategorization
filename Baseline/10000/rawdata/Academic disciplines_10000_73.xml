      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5731">The '''[https://www.uaf.edu/anlc/index.xml Alaska Native Language Center]''', established in 1972 in [[Fairbanks]], [[Alaska]], is a research center focusing on the research and documentation of the Native languages of [[Alaska]]. It publishes grammars, dictionaries, folklore collections and research materials, as well as hosting an extensive archive of written materials relating to [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo]], [[Northern Athabaskan languages|North Athabaskan]] and related languages. The Center provides training, materials and consultation for educators, researchers and others working with [[Alaska Native languages]]. The closely affiliated [[Alaska Native Language Program]] offers degrees in [[Central Alaskan Yup'ik language|Central Yup'ik]] and [[Inupiat language|Inupiaq]] at the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]], and works toward the documentation and preservation of these languages.

==Language map==
In 1974, Michael Krauss published a language map of Alaska, which he later updated in 1982.  It has remained the standard since then.  In the summer of 2011, the Alaska Native Language Center made an update to Krauss's map.&lt;ref name="Alaska Dispatch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alaskadispatch.com/article/alaskas-indigenous-languages-map-gets-updated-first-time-30-years | title= Alaska's indigenous languages map gets updated, for first time in 30 years | author = Ben Anderson | date= 2011-07-15 | accessdate= 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the biggest reasons for this update was that some of the names of these languages had changed over the years.  While there was not a dramatic change in the updated map, the new edition is entirely digital.&lt;ref name="Indigenous Peoples and Languages of Alaska"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.alaskool.org/language/languagemap/index.html | title = Indigenous People and Languages of Alaska | author = Gary Holton | year= 2011 | accessdate = 2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[anthropology]], '''anthropopoiesis''' is the self-building process of social man and of a whole culture, particularly referred to what concerns modifications of socialized body. The concept found applications mainly in French and Italian contemporary literatures.

In accordance with theoretic background which supports the idea, man is an unfinished being or better his behaviour is not strongly prefixed by genetic heritage. Human beings become fully finished only by means of culture acquisition.

Anthropopoiesis is both anthropogenesis (man “reborn” as social creature) and manufacturing of ”mankind patterns and fictions”. Therefore social and cultural practices build up the man by means of ritual and institutional constraints.

An example could be circumcision, a practice widely existing in many rites of passage amongst Islamic and Jewish believers and also amongst traditional cultures and communities. Besides, Christians ascribe a clear meaning to the sacred garment and to the tonsure; they are convinced that some sacramental rites mark indelible dispositions. All that affects the body and through this one the perception of one’s own identity and social status.

{{Duplication|dupe=Numerical weather prediction|date=June 2016|discuss=Talk:Atmospheric model#Duplication}}
An '''atmospheric model''' is a [[mathematical model]] constructed around the full set of [[primitive equations|primitive]] [[Dynamical systems theory|dynamical equations]] which govern atmospheric motions. It can supplement these equations with [[Parametrization (climate)|parameterizations]] for [[Turbulence|turbulent]] diffusion, [[radiation]], [[moist processes]] ([[clouds]] and [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]]), [[heat transfer|heat exchange]], [[soil]], vegetation, surface water, the [[Kinematics|kinematic]] effects of [[terrain]], and convection. Most atmospheric models are numerical, i.e. they discretize equations of motion. They can predict microscale phenomena such as [[tornadoes]] and [[Eddy covariance|boundary layer eddies]], sub-microscale turbulent flow over buildings, as well as synoptic and global flows. The horizontal domain of a model is either ''global'', covering the entire [[Earth]], or ''regional'' (''limited-area''), covering only part of the Earth.  The different types of models run are thermotropic, [[barotropic]], hydrostatic, and nonhydrostatic.  Some of the model types make assumptions about the atmosphere which lengthens the time steps used and increases computational speed.

Forecasts are computed using mathematical equations for the physics and dynamics of the atmosphere.  These equations are nonlinear and are impossible to solve exactly. Therefore, numerical methods obtain approximate solutions.  Different models use different solution methods.  Global models often use [[spectral method]]s for the horizontal dimensions and [[Finite difference method|finite-difference methods]] for the vertical dimension, while regional models usually use finite-difference methods in all three dimensions.  For specific locations, [[model output statistics]] use climate information, output from [[numerical weather prediction]], and current [[surface weather observation]]s to develop statistical relationships which account for model bias and resolution issues.

== Types ==
The main assumption made by the '''thermotropic''' model is that while the magnitude of the [[thermal wind]] may change, its direction does not change with respect to height, and thus the [[Baroclinity|baroclinicity]] in the atmosphere can be simulated using the {{convert|500|mb|inHg|adj=on|abbr=on|lk=on}} and {{convert|1000|mb|inHg|adj=on|abbr=on}} [[geopotential height]] surfaces and the average thermal wind between them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gates|first=W. Lawrence|title=Results Of Numerical Forecasting With The Barotropic And Thermotropic Atmospheric Models|date=August 1955|publisher=Air Force Cambridge Research Laboratories|location=[[Hanscom Air Force Base]]|url=http://handle.dtic.mil/100.2/AD101943|accessdate=2011-02-11}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=P. D.|author2=W. Lawrence Gates|title=A Test of Numerical Prediction Methods Based on the Barotropic and Two-Parameter Baroclinic Models|journal=[[Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|Journal of Meteorology]]| date=April 1956 |volume=13|issue=2|pages=127–141|doi=10.1175/1520-0469(1956)013&lt;0127:ATONPM&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=1520-0469|bibcode = 1956JAtS...13..127T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Barotropic''' models assume the atmosphere is nearly [[barotropic]], which means that the direction and speed of the [[geostrophic wind]] are independent of height.  In other words, no vertical [[wind shear]] of the geostrophic wind.  It also implies that thickness contours (a proxy for temperature) are parallel to upper level height contours.  In this type of atmosphere, [[high-pressure area|high]] and [[low-pressure area|low pressure area]]s are centers of warm and cold temperature anomalies.  Warm-core highs (such as the [[subtropical ridge]] and Bermuda-Azores high) and [[cold-core low]]s have strengthening winds with height, with the reverse true for cold-core highs (shallow arctic highs) and warm-core lows (such as [[tropical cyclone]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Atmospheric Science: An Introductory Survey|author1=Wallace, John M.  |author2=Peter V. Hobbs |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1977|isbn=0-12-732950-1|publisher=Academic Press, Inc.|pages=384–385}}&lt;/ref&gt; A barotropic model tries to solve a simplified form of [[atmospheric dynamics]] based on the assumption that the atmosphere is in [[geostrophic balance]]; that is, that the [[Rossby number]] of the air in the atmosphere is small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Marshall|first=John|title=Atmosphere, ocean, and climate dynamics : an introductory text|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Academic Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=978-0-12-558691-7|author2=Plumb, R. Alan|pages=109–12|chapter=Balanced flow}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the assumption is made that the atmosphere is [[divergence-free]], the [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] of the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] reduces into the [[barotropic vorticity equation]]. This latter equation can be solved over a single layer of the atmosphere. Since the atmosphere at a height of approximately {{convert|5.5|km|mi}} is mostly divergence-free, the barotropic model best approximates the state of the atmosphere at a [[geopotential height]] corresponding to that altitude, which corresponds to the atmosphere's {{convert|500|mb|inHg|abbr=on}} pressure surface.&lt;ref name="Charney 1950"/&gt;&lt;!-- also solved as a stream function, need to find a reference for that --&gt;

[[Primitive equations#Vertical pressure.2C Cartesian tangential plane|'''Hydrostatic''' model]]s filter out vertically moving [[acoustic wave]]s from the vertical momentum equation, which significantly increases the time step used within the model's run.  This is known as the [[hydrostatic equilibrium|hydrostatic approximation]].  Hydrostatic models use either pressure or [[sigma coordinate system|sigma-pressure]] vertical coordinates.  Pressure coordinates intersect topography while sigma coordinates follow the contour of the land.  Its hydrostatic assumption is reasonable as long as horizontal grid resolution is not small, which is a scale where the hydrostatic assumption fails.  Models which use the entire vertical momentum equation are known as '''nonhydrostatic'''.  A nonhydrostatic model can be solved anelastically, meaning it solves the complete [[continuity equation]] for air assuming it is incompressible, or elastically, meaning it solves the complete continuity equation for air and is fully compressible.  Nonhydrostatic models use altitude or sigma altitude for their vertical coordinates.  Altitude coordinates can intersect land while sigma-altitude coordinates follow the contours of the land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPwEf-1f73wC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=hydrostatic+model+book#v=onepage&amp;q=hydrostatic%20model%20book&amp;f=false|pages=138–143|title=Fundamentals of atmospheric modeling|author=Jacobson, Mark Zachary|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2011-02-15|isbn=978-0-521-83970-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[atmosphere]] is a [[fluid]]. As such, the idea of numerical weather prediction is to sample the state of the fluid at a given time and use the equations of [[fluid dynamics]] and [[thermodynamics]] to estimate the state of the fluid at some time in the future.  On land, terrain maps, available at resolutions down to {{convert|1|km|mi}} globally, are used to help model atmospheric circulations within regions of rugged topography, in order to better depict features such as downslope winds, mountain waves, and related cloudiness which affects incoming solar radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lMXSpRwKNO8C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=radiation+mountain+parameterization+book#v=onepage&amp;q=radiation%20mountain%20parameterization%20book&amp;f=false|title=Parameterization schemes: keys to understanding numerical weather prediction models|author=Stensrud, David J.|page=56|year=2007|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=2011-02-15|isbn=978-0-521-86540-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main inputs from country-based weather services are surface observations from automated [[weather station]]s at ground level over land and from weather buoys at sea.

A model is a computer program that produces [[meteorological]] information for future times at given locations and altitudes.   Within any model is a set of equations, known as the [[primitive equations]], used to predict the future state of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These equations are initialized from the analysis data and rates of change are determined.  These rates of change predict the state of the atmosphere a short time into the future, with each time increment known as a time step.  The equations are then applied to this new atmospheric state to find new rates of change, and these new rates of change predict the atmosphere at a yet further time into the future.  ''Time stepping'' is repeated until the solution reaches the desired forecast time.  The length of the time step chosen within the model is related to the distance between the points on the computational grid, and is chosen to maintain [[numerical stability]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pielke|first=Roger A.|title=Mesoscale Meteorological Modeling|year=2002|publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-554766-8|pages=285–287}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Time steps for global models are on the order of tens of minutes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JZikIbXzipwC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=time+step+numerical+weather+prediction#v=onepage&amp;q=time%20step%20numerical%20weather%20prediction&amp;f=false|page=132|title=Computational Science – ICCS 2005: 5th International Conference, Atlanta, GA, USA, May 22–25, 2005, Proceedings, Part 1|authors=Sunderam, V.

== Parameterization ==
{{main|Parametrization (climate)}}
Weather and climate model gridboxes have sides of between {{convert|5|km|mi}} and {{convert|300|km|mi}}.  A typical [[cumulus cloud]] has a scale of less than {{convert|1|km|mi}}, and would require a grid even finer than this to be represented physically by the equations of fluid motion.  Therefore, the processes that such [[clouds]] represent are ''[[Parametrization|parameterized]]'', by processes of various sophistication.  In the earliest models, if a column of air in a model gridbox was unstable (i.e., the bottom warmer than the top) then it would be overturned, and the air in that vertical column mixed.  More sophisticated schemes add enhancements, recognizing that only some portions of the box might [[convection|convect]] and that entrainment and other processes occur.  Weather models that have gridboxes with sides between {{convert|5|km|mi}} and {{convert|25|km|mi}} can explicitly represent convective clouds, although they still need to parameterize [[cloud microphysics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/126017.pdf|title=3.7 Improving Precipitation Forecasts by the Operational Nonhydrostatic Mesoscale Model with the Kain-Fritsch Convective Parameterization and Cloud Microphysics|author1=Narita, Masami  |author2=Shiro Ohmori |lastauthoramp=yes |date=2007-08-06|accessdate=2011-02-15|publisher=[[American Meteorological Society]]|journal=12th Conference on Mesoscale Processes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The formation of large-scale ([[stratus cloud|stratus]]-type) clouds is more physically based, they form when the [[relative humidity]] reaches some prescribed value.  Still, sub grid scale processes need to be taken into account.  Rather than assuming that clouds form at 100% relative humidity, the [[cloud fraction]] can be related to a critical relative humidity of 70% for stratus-type clouds, and at or above 80% for cumuliform clouds,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~dargan/591/diag_cloud.tech.pdf |pages=4–5 |title=The Diagnostic Cloud Parameterization Scheme |author=Frierson, Dargan |publisher=[[University of Washington]] |date=2000-09-14 |accessdate=2011-02-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401013742/http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~dargan/591/diag_cloud.tech.pdf |archivedate=1 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; reflecting the sub grid scale variation that would occur in the real world.

==Domains==
The horizontal domain of a model is either ''global'', covering the entire Earth, or ''regional'', covering only part of the Earth. Regional models also are known as ''limited-area'' models, or LAMs.  Regional models use finer grid spacing to resolve explicitly smaller-scale meteorological phenomena, since their smaller domain decreases computational demands.  Regional models use a compatible global model for initial conditions of the edge of their domain.  Uncertainty and errors within LAMs are introduced by the global model used for the boundary conditions of the edge of the regional model, as well as within the creation of the boundary conditions for the LAMs itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6RQ3dnjE8lgC&amp;pg=PA261&amp;dq=use+of+ensemble+forecasts+book#v=onepage&amp;q=use%20of%20ensemble%20forecasts%20book&amp;f=false|title=Numerical Weather and Climate Prediction|author=Warner, Thomas Tomkins |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-51389-0|page=259|accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vertical coordinate is handled in various ways. Some models, such as Richardson's 1922 model, use geometric height (&lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) as the vertical coordinate. Later models substituted the geometric &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; coordinate with a pressure coordinate system, in which the [[geopotential height]]s of constant-pressure surfaces become [[dependent variable]]s, greatly simplifying the primitive equations.&lt;ref name="Lynch Ch2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Lynch|first=Peter|title=The Emergence of Numerical Weather Prediction|year=2006|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=978-0-521-85729-1|pages=45–46|chapter=The Fundamental Equations}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This follows since pressure decreases with height through the [[Earth's atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ahrens, C.

High-resolution models—also called ''mesoscale models''—such as the [[Weather Research and Forecasting model]] tend to use normalized pressure coordinates referred to as ''[[sigma coordinates]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Janjic |first=Zavisa |title=Scientific Documentation for the NMM Solver |url=http://nldr.library.ucar.edu/collections/technotes/asset-000-000-000-845.pdf |publisher=[[National Center for Atmospheric Research]] |accessdate=2011-01-03 |author2=Gall, Robert |author3=Pyle, Matthew E. |pages=12–13 |date=February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823082059/http://nldr.library.ucar.edu/collections/technotes/asset-000-000-000-845.pdf |archivedate=2011-08-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model output statistics==
{{Main|Model output statistics}}
Because forecast models based upon the equations for atmospheric dynamics do not perfectly determine weather conditions near the ground, statistical corrections were developed to attempt to resolve this problem. Statistical models were created based upon the three-dimensional fields produced by numerical weather models, surface observations, and the climatological conditions for specific locations.  These statistical models are collectively referred to as [[model output statistics]] (MOS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=blEMoIKX_0IC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;dq=model+output+statistics+book#v=onepage&amp;q=model%20output%20statistics%20book&amp;f=false|page=189|title=When nature strikes: weather disasters and the law|author=Baum, Marsha L.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2007|isbn=978-0-275-22129-4|accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were developed by the [[National Weather Service]] for their suite of weather forecasting models.&lt;ref name="MOS"&gt;{{cite book|title=Model output statistics forecast guidance|author=Harry Hughes|publisher=United States Air Force Environmental Technical Applications Center|year=1976|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force]] developed its own set of MOS based upon their dynamical weather model by 1983.&lt;ref name="L. Best, D. L. and S. P. Pryor 1983 1–90"/&gt;

Model output statistics differ from the ''perfect prog'' technique, which assumes that the output of numerical weather prediction guidance is perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QwzHZ-wV-BAC&amp;pg=PA1144&amp;dq=model+output+statistics+book#v=onepage&amp;q=model%20output%20statistics%20book&amp;f=false|page=1144|title=Fog and boundary layer clouds: fog visibility and forecasting|author=Gultepe, Ismail|publisher=Springer|year=2007|isbn=978-3-7643-8418-0|accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  MOS can correct for local effects that cannot be resolved by the model due to insufficient grid resolution, as well as model biases.  Forecast parameters within MOS include maximum and minimum temperatures, percentage chance of rain within a several hour period, precipitation amount expected, chance that the precipitation will be frozen in nature, chance for thunderstorms, cloudiness, and surface winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Xs9LiGpNX-AC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=model+output+statistics+book#v=onepage&amp;q=model%20output%20statistics%20book&amp;f=false|page=172|author1=Barry, Roger Graham  |author2=Richard J.

===Climate modeling===

In 1956, Norman Phillips developed a mathematical model that realistically depicted monthly and seasonal patterns in the troposphere. This was the first successful [[climate model]].&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.phy.pku.edu.cn/climate/class/cm2010/Phillips_QJRMS_1956.pdf | title=The general circulation of the atmosphere: a numerical experiment | journal=[[Quarterly Journal of the Royal Meteorological Society]] | author=Norman A.

===Limited area modeling===

[[Air pollution]] forecasts depend on atmospheric models to provide [[fluid flow]] information for tracking the movement of pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Alexander Baklanov | author2=Alix Rasmussen | author3=Barbara Fay | author4=Erik Berge | author5=Sandro Finardi | title=Potential and Shortcomings of Numerical Weather Prediction Models in Providing Meteorological Data for Urban Air Pollution Forecasting | journal=Water, Air, &amp; Soil Pollution: Focus | date=September 2002 | volume=2 | issue=5 | pages=43–60 | doi=10.1023/A:1021394126149}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, a private company in the U.S. developed the regional Urban Airshed Model (UAM), which was used to forecast the effects of air pollution and [[acid rain]]. In the mid- to late-1970s, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] took over the development of the UAM and then used the results from a regional air pollution study to improve it. Although the UAM was developed for [[California]], it was during the 1980s used elsewhere in North America, Europe, and Asia.&lt;ref name="Steyn, D. G. 1991 241–242"/&gt;

'''Bryology''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] {{transl|el|bryon}}, a moss, a liverwort) is the branch of [[botany]] concerned with the scientific study of [[bryophyte]]s ([[moss]]es, [[liverworts]], and [[hornwort]]s).  '''Bryologists''' are people who have an active interest in observing, recording, classifying or researching  bryophytes.&lt;ref name=nybg&gt;{{cite web|title=Bryology at the New York Botanical Garden|url=http://sciweb.nybg.org/science2/Bryology.asp|publisher=New York Botanical Garden|accessdate=24 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field is often studied along with [[lichenology]] due to the similar appearance and ecological niche of the two organisms, even though bryophytes and lichens are not classified in the same kingdom.

[[File:Bryophyte 1.jpg|thumb|right|Common bryophytes found in central Japan]]

==History==
Bryophytes were first studied in detail in the 18th century. The German botanist [[Johann Jacob Dillenius]] (1687–1747) was a professor at [[Oxford University|Oxford]] and in 1717 produced the work "Reproduction of the [[fern]]s and mosses." The beginning of bryology really belongs to the work of [[Johannes Hedwig]], who clarified the reproductive system of mosses (1792, ''Fundamentum historiae naturalist muscorum'') and arranged a [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]].

Areas of research include bryophyte [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], bryophytes as [[bioindicator]]s, [[DNA sequencing]], and the interdependency of bryophytes and other plant and animal species. Among other things, scientists have discovered parasitic bryophytes such as ''[[Cryptothallus]]'' and potentially carnivorous liverworts such as ''[[Colura zoophaga]]'' and ''[[Pleurozia]]''.

Centers of research in bryology include the [[University of Bonn]] in Germany, the University of Helsinki in Finland and the [[New York Botanical Garden]].

==Notable bryologists==

* [[Elizabeth Gertrude Britton]] (1858–1934)
* [[Margaret Sibella Brown]] (1866–1961)
* [[Heinrich Christian Funck]] (1771–1839)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1073">The '''CLEAN''' algorithm is a computational algorithm to perform a [[deconvolution]] on images created in [[radio astronomy]]. It was published by {{ill|Jan Högbom|sv}} in 1974&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdsads.u-strasbg.fr/abs/1974A%26AS...15..417H Aperture Synthesis with a Non-Regular Distribution of Interferometer Baselines], original publication by Jan Högbom about CLEAN, in the Astronomy and Astrophysics Supplement, Vol. 15, p.417&lt;/ref&gt; and several variations have been proposed since then.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iram.fr/IRAMFR/GILDAS/doc/html/map-html/node37.html The family of CLEAN algorithms], a chapter from the ''MAPPING'' software manual&lt;/ref&gt;

The algorithm assumes that the image consists of a number of point sources. It will iteratively find the highest value in the image and subtract a small gain of this point source convolved with the [[point spread function]] ("dirty beam") of the observation, until the highest value is smaller than some threshold.

A '''chemistry set''' is an [[educational toy]] allowing the user (typically a [[teenager]]) to perform simple [[chemistry]] [[experiment]]s.

==History==

===Forerunners===
[[File:Natural Magick by Giambattista della Porta.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''Natural Magick'', Giambattista della Porta, 1658]]
[[File:Gottling Description of a portable chest of chemistry title page 1791.jpg|thumb|right|120px| ''Description of a portable chest of chemistry'', 1791]]
[[File:Griffin’s Chemical Laboratory.jpg |thumb|upright=1.2|right| Griffin’s Chemical Laboratory, Glasgow, ca.1850.]]

The earliest forerunners of the chemistry set are 17th century books on "natural magick", "which all excellent wise men do admit and embrace, and worship with great applause; neither is there any thing more highly esteemed, or better thought of, by men of learning."&lt;ref name="Deckard"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Deckard|first1=Michael Funk|last2=Losonczi|first2=Péter|title=Philosophy begins in wonder : an introduction to early modern philosophy, theology, and science|date=2010|publisher=Pickwick Publications|location=Eugene, Or.|isbn=978-1556357824|pages=55–57|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IYcSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=4 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors such as [[Giambattista della Porta]] included chemical magic tricks and scientific puzzles along with more serious topics.&lt;ref name="Deckard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Macrakis"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macrakis|first1=Kristie|title=Prisoners, lovers, &amp; spies : the story of invisible ink from Herodotus to al-Qaeda|date=2014|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=9780300179255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest chemistry sets were developed in the 18th century in England and Germany, with the purpose of teaching chemistry to adults.  In 1791, ''Description of a portable chest of chemistry : or, Complete collection of chemical tests for the use of chemists, physicians, mineralogists, metallurgists, scientific artists, manufacturers, farmers, and the cultivators of natural philosophy'' by [[Johann Friedrich August Göttling]], translated from German, was published in English.&lt;ref name="Goettling"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goettling|first1=Johann Friedrich August|title=Description of a portable chest of chemistry : or, Complete collection of chemical tests for the use of chemists, physicians, mineralogists, metallurgists, scientific artists, manufacturers, farmers, and the cultivators of natural philosophy / invented by J.F.A. Gottling ; translated from the original German|date=1791|publisher=Printed for C. and G. Kearsley|location=London|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=osu.32435018354548;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Accum]] of London, England also sold portable chemistry sets and materials to refill them.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;    Used primarily for training druggists and medical students, they could also be carried and used in the field.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Scientific kits also attracted well-educated members of the upper class who enjoyed experimenting and demonstrating their results.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schmidt|first1=James M.|title=The Chemistry Set: Chemistry's legacy of the home laboratory|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=12–13, 34–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Woodhouse]] of Philadelphia presented a ''Young Chemist's Pocket Companion'' (1797) with an accompanying portable laboratory, specifically targeted ladies and gentlemen. [[Jane Marcet]]'s books on chemistry helped to popularize chemistry as a well-to-do pastime for both men and women.&lt;ref name="Cook"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Rosie|title=Chemistry at Play|journal=Chemical Heritage Magazine|date=2010|volume=28|issue=1|pages=20–25|url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/chemistry-at-play|accessdate=23 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the late 1850s [[John Joseph Griffin|John J. Griffin &amp; Sons]] sold a line of "chemical cabinets", eventually offering 11 categories. These were marketed primarily to adults including elementary school teachers as well as students at the Royal Naval College, the [[Royal Agricultural Society of England|Royal Agricultural Society]], and the universities of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

In the mid to late 1800s England, magic and illusion toys enabled children to make their own fireworks, create disappearing inks and cause changes in color, tricks which were mostly chemically based.&lt;ref name="Nicholls"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nicholls|first1=Henry|title=The chemistry set generation|url=http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/issues/2007/december/thechemistrysetgeneration.asp|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=Royal Society of Chemistry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Columbian Cyclopedia'' of 1897 defines "CHEMISTRY TOYS" as "mostly [[pyrotechnic]]; recommended as illustrating to the young the rudiments of chemistry, but probably more dangerous than efficient for such use", listing a variety of hazardous examples.&lt;ref name="Columbian"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Columbian Cyclopedia|date=1897|publisher=Garretson, Cox &amp; Company|location=New York|url=http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/007958177|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemistry sets as toys===
[[File:Porter Chemcraft Senior Set No. 6105 2004046 closed.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Porter Chemcraft Senior Set, 1957, at the [[Science History Institute]] ]]

Beginning in the early 1900s, modern chemistry sets targeted younger people with the intention to popularize chemistry. In the United States, [[Porter Chemical Company]] and the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]] produced the best known sets. Although Porter and Gilbert were the largest American producers of chemistry sets, other manufacturers such as the [[Skilcraft]] corporation were also active.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

[[John J. Porter]] and his brother [[Harold Mitchell Porter]] began The Porter Chemical Company in 1914. Their initial purpose was to sell packaged chemicals, but they soon introduced kits. John researched the experiments, while Harold wrote the instruction manuals. Their earliest toys, under the "Chemcraft" trademark, were "chemical magic" sets, selling for less than one dollar (or about $25 in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=1&amp;year1=191401&amp;year2=201711&lt;/ref&gt;). By the 1920s, they sold six different sets, the largest of which sold for $25 (or about $320 in 2017&lt;ref&gt;https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl?cost1=25.00&amp;year1=192001&amp;year2=201711&lt;/ref&gt;). Their range of toys broadened throughout the 1930s.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; In the 1950s it was possible to buy toys featuring radioactive ores, such as the "[[Gilbert U-238 Atomic Energy Laboratory]]," which included a [[Geiger counter]] and [[cloud chamber]].&lt;ref name="Kingson"/&gt;

[[File:1940s Gilbert chemistry set 04.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A 1940s [[A. C. Gilbert Company|Gilbert]] chemistry set]]

[[Alfred Carlton Gilbert]] earned money by performing magic tricks while a medical student at Yale. He and John Petrie formed the Mysto Manufacturing Company (later the [[A. C. Gilbert Company]]) in 1909, and began selling boxed magic sets. By 1917, they sold chemistry sets, which they produced through [[World War II]], in spite of restrictions on materials. [[Robert Treat Johnson]], noting the number of chemistry students at Yale whose interest in the science began with a chemistry set, argued the production of chemistry sets was a "patriotic duty."&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;

Toy companies promoted chemistry sets through advertising campaigns, the "Chemcraft Chemist Club" and its accompanying "Chemcraft Science Magazine", comic books, and essay contests such as Porter's "Why I want to be a scientist". The goal of attracting students to a potential career in chemistry was often explicit in the sets' naming and promotion.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt; Chemistry sets may have been the first American toys marketed toward parents with the goal of "improving" children for success in later life.&lt;ref name="Kingson"/&gt;

[[File:Gilbert Lab Technician Set for Girls 1958.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Gilbert Lab Technician Set for Girls, 1958, at the [[Science History Institute]] ]]

The target market for chemistry sets was almost exclusively at boys, whom they deemed "young men of science." However, during the 1950s, Gilbert managed to introduce a set targeting girls. They sold the set in an attractive pink box, but the set identified girls as "laboratory assistants" or "lab technicians," not scientists.&lt;ref name="Schmidt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kingson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingson|first1=Jennifer A.|title=A Brief History of Chemistry Sets: Practical to Career-Oriented to Just Plain Fun|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/science/a-brief-history-of-chemistry-sets.html?_r=0|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=December 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Well-known chemistry sets from the United Kingdom include the 1960s and 1970s sets by [[Thomas Salter (company)|Thomas Salter]] Science (produced in Scotland) and later [[Salter Science]], then the [[J &amp; L Randall|"MERIT"]] sets through the 1970s and 1980s. [[Dekkertoys]] created a range of sets which were similar, complete with glass test tubes of dry chemicals.

==Decline== 
Around the 1960s, increasing social distrust of chemistry, safety concerns, and government regulation began to limit the range of materials and experiments available in chemistry sets. In the United States, the [[Federal Hazardous Substances Labeling Act]] of 1960, the [[Toy Safety Act]] of 1969 and the [[Consumer Product Safety Commission]], established in 1972, and the [[Toxic Substances Control Act]] of 1976 all introduced new levels of regulation,&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt; which led to the decline of chemistry sets' popularity during the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Monahan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Monahan|first1=Maureen|title=The Dynamic History of the Toy Chemistry Set|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/72452/dynamic-history-toy-chemistry-set|accessdate=1 February 2016|work=Mental Floss|date=December 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The A. C. Gilbert Company went out of business in 1967, and the Porter Chemical Company went out of business in 1984.&lt;ref name="Cook"/&gt;

Modern chemistry sets, with a few exceptions, tend to include a more restricted range of chemicals and simplified instructions. Many chemistry kits are single use, containing only the types and amounts of chemicals for a specific application.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Château de la Motte''' is a [[château|chateau]] located in the commune of [[Joué-du-Plain]] ([[Orne]]) in [[Normandy]], France. The chateau began as a Viking [[Motte-and-bailey castle]] and evolved into the 18th and 19th century Château seen today. The two most noted families who owned the site were the Gabriel Montgommerys and the Nicolas Angos, but its role as Resistance center in [[World War II]] may be its most notable episode.

Long established [[Normans|Norman]] chateaus, like Château de la Motte, usually originate from [[motte-and-bailey castle]]s constructed during the earliest Norman period in the 10th and 11th centuries. The bourgeois Ango family built much of Château de la Motte in the late 16th and early 18th century. They bought the original chateau from one of the most noted names in Normandy: the descendants of [[Gabriel de Montgomery|Gabriel de Montgomery I]] (''Montgommery''). In 1559, Montgomery had accidentally killed King [[Henry II of France]] in a joust.

Château de la Motte sits at the end of a long [[chestnut]] [[Tree Avenue or tree alley (allée)|tree alley]] or [[Avenue (landscape)|avenue]] linking to the commune of [[Joué-du-Plain]] and the village of [[Écouché]]. The ''château's'' former farm, with an arched entry and [[coat-of-arms]] may have been the original chateau built in the 1660s. Today's chateau and a number of buildings have dates from the early 1820s, after restorations from the Deschamps family following the [[French Revolution]].

In the [[World War II|Second World War]], the chateau operated as a dairy and holiday home for Paris prostitutes. However, at the same time it functioned as headquarters for the [[French Resistance|Resistance]]. Escaping Allied pilots and an important arms depot were hidden here. The discovery of the depot by the Germans caused the assassination of the local mayor, and an unresolved crime, the subject of two criminal investigations and one book.

==Name, water sources and first historic mention==
[[File:Motte.png|thumb|19th-century rendition of a motte-and-bailey castle]]
Château de la Motte takes its name from the small-forested rise next to the current house, called a motte ("clod of earth" in Old French). The small mound is the remains of a [[Viking]]/Norman [[motte-and-bailey castle]] (''motte castrale, motte féodale'' in Old French). Mottes were made throughout France and Europe from the 10th century until the early 13th century, with many sites carrying the title of La Motte, Les Mottes, Forêt de la Motte, or Château de la Motte.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lepelley|first=René|title=Noms de lieux de Normandie|year=1999|publisher=Bonneton|location=Paris|pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Site and water sources===
Mottes often sat on [[Roman villa]] sites because water sources and strategic location needs were the same in both eras. Although numerous villa ruins were found nearby with the recent [[A88 autoroute]] construction, it is unknown whether this site was occupied before the Vikings, absent [[archaeological excavation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Clairfontaine|first=François Fichet|title=ArchéOrne: 250 ans d'archéologié|year=2008|publisher=Cahiers du Temp|location=Cabourg|isbn=978-2-911855-99-3|pages=96–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
The Château's site, including [[orchard]] and farm, has seven sources of water. Like most chateaus and mottes, this was likely the main consideration for the location. Wells and water management were important from earlier times as most drinking sources were contaminated, and sufficient water for animals was critical, even in rain-soaked Normandy. Water pollution was a known source of sickness from antiquity onward, although poorly understood.&lt;ref name=sirot/&gt;{{rp|74, 90}}

In the 15th century, when chateaus lost their defensive function, moats fulfilled prestige and aesthetic roles as well as providing fishponds, an important source of protein for peasants.&lt;ref name=sirot/&gt;{{rp|76}}

===First historic mention===
The first mention of Château de la Motte is a letter from Guillame Lesor in 1217, asking to be a vassal of the French King. This letter followed the loss by [[King John of England]] (1199–1216) at the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214, forcing an English withdrawal from 
Normandy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rousseau|first=Xavier|title=Joue-du-Plain|journal=Le Pays d'Argentan|date= December 1958|volume=4|series=Dictionnaire du Pays d'Argentan.|issue=110|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
The first motte and bailey forts were built to defend Viking/Norman power in Normandy, as the lords of [[Maine (province of France)|Maine]] in the south, and [[Brittany (French region)|Brittany]], to the west, occasionally intruded in force. The river [[Orne (river)|Orne]] was the southernmost Norman boundary for much of the 10th century, and was defended by a series of mottes, usually in groups.&lt;ref name=prier&gt;{{cite journal|last=Delacampagne|first=Florence|title=Seigneurs, fiefs et mottes du Cotentin|journal=Archéologié Médiévale|year=1982|pages=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Prier|first=Annie|title=Sur les Chemins de l'Orne Romane|year=2001|publisher=Europe Media Duplication|location=Lassay les Chateaux|isbn=2-9516406-0-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}}

Motte and bailey castles usually had two main parts, both surrounded by wet or dry moats, then a wooden [[palisade]]. First constructed was the motte, or earthmound topped by a wooden tower. The tower was a last defense in an attack, and sometimes the lord's residence. The bailey contained barns, barracks, blacksmithy, chapel and other support structures. A removable wooden bridge linked the tower to the courtyard and a single fortified gate welcomed the visitor crossing the moat.

The motte may have been similar to one excavated nearby at Land de Goult, near [[Carrouges]]. Archeologists uncovered a lower court {{convert|50|–|80|m|yds|sp=us}} across. The motte was {{convert|40|–|60|m|ft}} across at the base, with a flattened top for the tower {{convert|10|–|20|m|ft}} high and {{convert|15|–|20|m|ft}} wide at the top.&lt;ref name=prier/&gt;{{rp|29}}

After [[William the Conqueror]]'s death, his sons revived motte making in the area to consolidate power from nearby [[Château de Falaise|Château of Falaise]] and [[Argentan]]. Lords continued building motte and bailey castles in the region throughout the ongoing feudal anarchy, until the mid 12th century. Thus, Château de la Motte may have originated close the letter's date of 1217.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Neveux|first=François|title=The Normans|year=2006|publisher=Running Press Book Publishers|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7624-3371-1|pages=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tower and circle walls===
In the 11th century a large stone tower (fr.''grosses tour, grande tour'', or ''tour maîtresse'') was sometimes built over a water source, and the support buildings lined inside were attached to its circular wall. Stone for these structures would have been [[fieldstone]] and not cut; however, much of the structures may have been wood, or [[wattle and dab]], not stone. Like mottes, most exterior wooden walls would have been coated in plaster to reduce fire worries, and making them resemble stone buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panouillé|first=Jean-Pierre|title=Les Châteaux forts en France|year=2011|publisher=Ouest-France|location=Rennes|isbn=978-2-7373-5291-1|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fortified farm===
Château de la Motte, like most small chateaus, was most probably little more than a farm, possibly fortified during the [[Middle Ages]]. The king, or the [[duke of Normandy]], had to give permission for building fortifications; [[tower]]s, [[moats]], and [[crenellation]]s required licenses. Instead, rural architecture evolved a defensive function with buildings in compounds, built around a courtyard with water. The exterior walls had few windows, with an easy-to-defend entrance.&lt;ref name=sirot&gt;{{cite book|last=Sirot|first=Elisabeth|title=Noble et Forte Maison|year=2007|publisher=A&amp;J Picard|location=Paris}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
Careful orientation toward the south, like most country architecture in France, was moderated on the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic coast]], in order to block the storms from the southwest. Today's gatehouse or dependence protects the château from the weather as well. The walls surrounding the grounds created [[microclimates]], as well as defense, as intended. The rooftops deflect the winds upward, away from the residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Letenoux|first=Guy|title=Architecture et vie traditionelle en Normandie|year=1980|publisher=Berger-Levrault|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-7013-0394-9|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Donald|first=Elsie Burch|title=A la Découverte des Fermes de France|year=1995|publisher=Abbeville|location=Paris|isbn=2-87946-060-3|pages=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The lord's dwelling would have been a modest structure from the 11th to 16th centuries, even if the home were referred to as a [[Great Hall]] (''la grande salle''). The home would have at least two levels with storage on the ground floor and a large public room (''l'aula'') on the first floor, which was the actual great hall. This hall would have been a judicial, political, and economic center for the community, or [[parish]] (now ''[[commune]]''), and located near the entrance to the Château grounds. A lord's private chamber (''la camera'') would have been at one end, with true privacy only in the large curtained bed. The chapel (''la capella'') was typically near, or in, the home, but no site is known today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chueder|first=Lucile|title=Les Châteaux Fortes|year=2005|publisher=Editions Atlas|location=Évreux|isbn=2-7312-3212-9|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
During the Middle Ages, a lord's family usually moved between their various lands and residences, leaving the maintenance and farm production to a permanent staff. It was sort of a mandatory, perpetual picnic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=R.Allen|title=The Normans and the Norman Conquest|year=1969|publisher=Constable &amp; Co.|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-456260-8|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A noble household consisted of an extended family including many illegitimate half brothers and sisters, along with descendants from previous mixed offspring. A mother's status determined the roles in the family, with many positions as administrators and servants. Strategic marriages with other families were sought to defend the family's power and prestige, but a lord's daughter by other than his wife could marry a high servant. Sons were expected to leave the family for service in other lords’ homes.&lt;ref name=kf&gt;{{cite book|last=Fedden|first=Katherine|title=Manor Life in Old France; From the Journal of Sire de Gouberville|year=1933|publisher=Columbia Un.Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|21–29}}

A modest château had between 10 and 20 servants: farm and household staff such as shepherds, ditchers, cow herders, milkmaids, and cooks. Most pay was in-kind, such as food and clothes.&lt;ref name=kf/&gt;{{rp|14–21}}

Regardless of the construction, probably no comfortable home existed at Château de la Motte until the 17th century. [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] visited the region in 1579, and stayed in an inn five kilometers away in Écouché, because there was no place suitable for him nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Caix|first=Alfred|title=Histoire du bourg d'Écouché|year=1989|publisher=Res Universis|location=Paris|isbn=2-87760-116-1|pages=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the inspiration of [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]], ''châteaux de chasse'' (hunting chateaus/lodges) became popular as country retreats, with the hunt as the theme. These chateaus featured grand architecture, beautiful gardens, select majestic and exotic trees, greenhouses ''([[orangeries]])'' for luxuriant smells and spices, and grand entrances. A Google Earth view of the Château reveals an ancient hedge-line, or tree alley, leading from the current Château's gates to the Forest of la Motte (''bois de la motte'').

The existing majestic [[lime tree]]s (''tilleul'') near the house and ponds may have been originals or descendants of those planted by previous lords as limes gave prestige and the grandeur of shade. Traditionally they were often planted in the courtyards center as symbols of high justice.&lt;ref name=sirot/&gt;{{rp|76}}

==Lords, owners and major events==
Norman nobility originated as loyal friends and family of William the Conqueror. In turn, their knights and retainers became the petite nobility (''petite noblesse''), usually barons, which filled out the need for local authority and management. Early Château la Motte lords probably were among these nobles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=R.Allen|title=The Normans and the Norman Conquest|year=1969|publisher=Constable|location=London|isbn=978-0-09-456260-8|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The known owners are taken from the original charter, which existed at the time of the writing of the book, ''Histoire du bourg d'Écouché'' By Alfred Caix in 1867.

* 1217 - domain of Guillaume Lesor, first known use of the Château's name in a letter requesting vassalage to King Phillipe Auguste of France, after the English King [[John Lackland]] (1199–1216) lost the [[Battle of Bouvines]] in 1214 and withdrew from Normandy.
* 1357 – Nearby Argentan burned and pillaged by the English during the [[Hundred Years' War]].
* 1417 - September 21 letter from Fralin de la Motte asking for the protection of the French king. This was probably the result of [[King Henry V]]'s second invasion of Normandy in July 1417, and the fall of nearby Caen on September 8. The region remained under English control until 1449. Note: in [[Old French]], ''Fralin'' is a term meaning a farmer of a large parcel of land.
* 1553 – Catherine Lelievre left Château de la Motte to her daughter Françoise, who married Balthazar de Villers and they had a daughter Louise.
* 1554, 1586 and 1588 – [[The Black Death]] and several [[Protestant]] armies ravaged the region during the [[Wars of Religion]].
* 1570 – Louise Balthazar marries Jean de Bouquetot du Breuil-sur-Touque (1541–1611) They had a daughter Suzanne de Bouquetot.
* 1589 – Argentan supported the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic "Ligue"]], but the bourgeois opened the city gates to [[Henry IV of France|King Henry IV]] of France, a moderate and occasional Protestant.
* 1593 - Suzanne married Gabriel de Montgommery II (1565–1637) in [[Caen]]. Montgommery was Lord of Lorges and [[Courteilles]] ([[Eure]]), and with the wedding he became the Baron of Écouché. Gabriel II, like his more famous father, had been a commander of [[Huguenot]](Protestant) armies operating throughout Normandy. His primary family chateau was at [[Ducey]], near [[Mont Saint-Michel]]. A treaty in 1576 forgave Montgommery, and he stopped all military activity before his marriage.
* 1638 – The second Black Death struck down half the population of Argentan.
* 1641 – Jaques de Montgommery, son of Gabriel III, inherited Château de la Motte.
* 1654 – Catherine Cochon, from Château d'Almeneches, and the widow of Nicolas Ango, bought Château de la Motte from Jaques de Montgommery.
* 1655 – Jean (or Jacques), one of the seven Ango children married Marie Le Fèver de Lézeau and bought four partial fiefs in Joué-du-Plain. The Château was then called La Motte – Lézeau, the name found on the [[French cartography#Cassini maps|Cassini Map]].
* 1700s - Golden Age of Argentan. The town boasted 66 noble families and 3 royal lace manufacturers.
* 1790 [[The French Revolution]] – Population stagnated at 6000 people and no industry. Only 40 noble families remained. Normandy took neither side strongly during the upheaval.
* 1791, April 15 - Jean-Baptiste IV Ango sold the domains to Louis-Omer-Félicité Marquis d'Estampes for 620,000 francs. In 1793, d'Estampes was on the list of lords who left the country to escape the Revolution and the [[Reign of Terror]] (1789–1793).
* 1819 – Louis-Charles-David Deschamps (1802–1865) bought Château de la Motte and his family resided there. His daughter married Eugene Gabriel de Champrepus (1828–1892). Their son Andre inherited the Château, never married and died at the start of World War II.
* 1939 - Honaré Noel, owner of a ''café clos'', or house of prostitution, in Paris bought the Château from Andre Champrepus's nephew. The château was used as country holiday home for Noel's employees, the farm was rented out to a local animal dealer, the buildings were rented to a Paris suburb for a school, and the dependences were leased to a dairy, which became the center for the Resistance in the area. The Château was also the distribution center for food and gas coupons both during and after the War, until 1950. Germans occupied the Château‘s farm in the final months before the Liberation in August 1944.
[[File:Sherman tank.png|thumb|left|Free French troops used a Sherman tank in street combat in Écouché]]

===Gabriel de Montgommery II===
The most famous owner of the Château de la Motte was Gabriel de Montgommery II, who acquired the Château by marriage. [[Gabriel, comte de Montgomery|His father]], of the same name, was the commander of the [[Scottish Guard]]; he accidentally killed King [[Henry II of France]] in a jousting tournament.
  
The tragedy occurred during a [[joust]] celebrating the [[Peace of Cateau-Cambrésis]] treaty with the [[Habsburgs]], which ended the [[Italian War of 1551-1559]], and a marriage of the king's daughter. Gabriel de Montgommery I (1530–1574) killed the King Henry II of France when Montgommery's splintered lance sheared through the King's helmet visor and thrust into his face.
 
The King took 10 days to die, and although Montgommery was pardoned twice from the King's deathbed, he fled the country.

The young King's death shook Europe, and made the reputation of the prognosticator [[Nostradamus]], whose recent words seemed to foretell the event.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
:CI, Q 35 The young lion shall overcome the older one,
:on the field of combat in single battle.
:He shall pierce his eyes in a golden cage,
:Two forces one, then he shall die a cruel death."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The top sentence was actually added much later, but the last two lines attracted the popular attention.

Montgommery converted to Protestantism in England. Ironically, his job as commander of the [[Scottish Guard]] in France was to search out [[Huguenots]] (French Protestants), as well as protect the King's life. He returned to France to lead numerous military campaigns in the [[Wars of Religion]] for the Protestants. His son, Gabriel de Montgommery II, and eventual owner of Chateau de la Motte, also became a Protestant commander, before and after his father's capture at a siege at [[Domfront, Orne|Domfront]] and subsequent beheading.

Gabriel de Montgommery I, became a romantic figure linked to a book attributed to [[Alexander Dumas]]'', [[The Two Dianas]]''; a French movie; and the Tour Montgommery at Paris’ [[Conciergerie]], where Queen [[Marie Antoinette]] was imprisoned before being guillotined.
 
The son, Gabriel II was forgiven in the treaty of 1576, before his marriage to Suzanne de Bouquetot in 1593, daughter of the Baron of Écouché. He thus became the Lord of Château de la Motte.

The Montgommerys probably did not build at La Motte, but visited the area often, and possibly had a home in Écouché, which still exists.

===Nicolas Ango===
A year after Nicolas Ango's death (1654) his widow bought Chateau de la Motte and began building the farmhouse. Numerous other properties in Joué-du-Plain were also purchased, such as the nearby 16th-century manor Haut Mesnil, in order to fulfill the requirements of the acquiring the title of [[Marquis]]. Nicolas couldn’t attain the title himself, it went to his son, Jean-Baptist after the requisite amount of land was purchased. The title stayed with whoever owned the land afterward.

These titles were referred to as ''Lords of the Robe'', as opposed to the old aristocracy, like Montgommery, who were called ''Lords of the Sword'', who often had titles dating back to William the Conqueror.

Nicolas Ango was a wealthy [[bourgeois]], and a Counselor to the King. The family had already built the private mansion ''hotel particulier'', across from St. Germain Church in Argentan.

Purchase of the title [[marquisat]] brought income to the depleted royal treasury of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], but Jean-Baptist Ango earned the King's favor by buying and closing the Huguenot temple property in Joué-du-Plain. Louis XIV had begun the unpopular process of enforcing the law of making every Christian become a Catholic. Ango's action saved the King an unpleasant job.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Caix|first=Alfred|title=Histoire du bourg d'Écouché|year=1989|publisher=Res Universis|location=Paris|isbn=2-87760-116-1|pages=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean-Baptist Ango married Marie LeFevre of Lezeau, daughter of Nicolas Le Fevre, advisor to the Parliament of Rouen. On the 18th century Casini map, Marquis de la Motte- Ango was the Chateau's title.

The Ango source of wealth was unclear; he may have been a lawyer. Many new-rich rose rapidly as merchants, financiers, lawyers, and doctors during the Hundred Years' War and Wars of Religion, because many male aristocrats had died. Louis XIV chose his most trusted servants from among the rising bourgeois and small nobles; two examples were Vauban for fortifications and Colbert for finances.  [[Bourgeois]] were usually defined as professionals who did not work with their hands.

New lords, like the Angos, revived the ideals of country life. Jean-Baptist Ango built what would be the main residence around 1700, and probably the remainder of La Motte's buildings and walls.

The son, René-Phillipe de la Motte-Ango, married Antoinette de Dame Pellevé Flers. He became the Lord of Château de Flers after the premature deaths of her two uncles; the first uncle from a duel and the second from a horse-fall. The imposing granite [[Château de Flers]] is near the town center, and open to the public. Through skillful management, the Fler branch of the family became one of the wealthiest in France.

Jean Baptiste Ango IV sold the Château just before the beginning of the French Revolution. A letter from [[Voltaire]]  declined the ownership of the Chateau in place of payment of a debt of only a 1000 écu in 1758. The letter said the lands had been poorly managed and systematically pillaged by the local peasants.&lt;ref name="Rousseau"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rousseau|first=Xavier|title=Joué-du-Plain|journal=Le Pays d'Argentan|date=December 1958|volume=4|series=Dictionnaire de Pays d'Argentan|issue=110|pages=238–240}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==French Revolution and the 19th century==
During the [[French Revolution|Revolution]], like most chateaus, it was probably pillaged but not burned, as portrayed in popular imagination. No useful records survive from the time. Normandy was not strongly partisan during the period. An interim manager sold off stone from the main house to nearby farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdin|first=Gérald|title=La Révolution dans L'Orne|year=1988|publisher=Horvath|location=Le Coteau|isbn=2-7171-0612-X|pages=98–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1820 the prominent Deschamps family bought the Château and built the existing home, dated at 1821-22. The barn and the orchard house have similar dates chiseled over the entrances, indicating substantial reconstruction by the family.&lt;ref name="Rousseau"/&gt;
 
André Champrepus, the grandson of the original Deschamps, remembered as poor, portly and single, was the last Marquis. He died at the outbreak of the Second World War. Locals recall visiting the body presented in the Château's tower, and the nephew paying all the communes taxes that year, a custom among the nobility from the Middle Ages.

==Second World War==
Honoré Jean Noel bought the Château as a retreat for his employees. He owned a ‘’café clos’’, or house of prostitution, in Paris. The enterprising Noel with his wife and family live at the Château, and they rented out the farmland with most of the buildings. Locals recall his bringing his young women there for short breaks "to get a tan". He provided ponies and carts for the employee to explore the Château's grounds. He also owned two ''café clos'' in Argentan. Locals referred to him as Père Noel, and they recall his Provençal accent along with a Mdm. Julos, a loud, tattooed woman that was a permanent member of the family.

Emile Buffon, a well liked local man who soon became mayor of Joué-du-Plain rented the Chateau's farm. Mayors had the delicate jobs of negotiating between German demands and local resentments. This mayor's job made the position more difficult as he worked as an animal dealer. Buffon had to gather the farm animals of local farmers for the German army, as agreed to in the treaty of the French defeat. No farmer wanted to give up his best animals for Nazi diners.

* Buffon sublet the farmhouse to a boarding school for Coulombs, Seine-et-Marne, as 20 or so young girls age 8 to 14, attended school. The girls avoided the much-anticipated bombings and ate much better as well.
* Farmland was rented to local farmers
* Noel leased the two dependences to a dairy to Jacques and Yvonne Bachelier. The couple occupied the winter quarters of the Château owners, the apartments closest to the Château home itself. The dairy employees lived above the dairy's stables.
* Honoré Noel with his family and women stayed in the main château. He accepted the job of secretary to the mayor, which involved the distribution of coupons for food and fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miniac|first=Jean-François|title=Les Grandes Affaires Criminelles de l'Orne|year=2008|publisher=De Borée|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-84494-814-4|pages=153–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:France zonelibre blank.PNG|thumb|left|France zonelibre blank]]

The Normans in the countryside ate much better than the city dwellers throughout the War. Forward thinking Parisians made agreements with the farmers for food supplies to be sent on the train weekly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Viven|first=Richard|title=The Unfree French: Life under the Occupation|year=2007|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London|isbn=978-0-14-029684-6|pages=227–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local people knew things were about to change. Before 1944, Germany stationed most of its troops in towns and cities, and ignored the countryside. The dreaded [[Gestapo]], or [[Nazi]] internal police, only came to Normandy in force after January 1944. Until then, most troops stationed in France were older or ill-suited for combat. As the soldiers left, they warned the local French that their replacements would not be like them. Instead, the replacements would be young, intensely indoctrinated in Nazi ideology, and brutally battle hardened by combat on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Russian Front]]. These were the [[Waffen SS]].

In the days leading up to [[D-Day]] Europe, air battles in the Norman clouds became more common. The Allies needed experienced pilots. Airmen that survived shooting down made every effort to make contact with Résistance forces. With French help, the pilots were to cross France to neutral Spain in order to return to Great Britain to fly and fight again.
  
On April 30, 1944, Charles Moore was flying his [[P-51 Mustang]] back from escorting bombers over Germany when four [[Messerschmitt 109]] fighters attacked. He thought he had escaped, but realized he was losing altitude. He leapt from his plunging plane over Écouché. Madame Cavelot, a schoolgirl at the time, remembers seeing his parachute float above the countryside and a truck loading up with German soldiers to bring him in. Two young French boys found him moments before the soldiers did and led him to the Resistance.
[[File:375th Fighter Squadron North American P-51D-5-NA Mustang 44-13926.jpg|thumb|A P-51 Mustang of the type flown by Moore]]

Moore recalled later that he did not know all the places he hid with the Resistance, but postwar memoires indicated he stayed in Château de la Motte. Others probably did as well, but no records survive saying whom. He recalled being smuggled to a new hideout by Denise Bachelier (sister to dairy owner and Resistant Jacques Bachelier). She returned home to find Germans waiting for her. It was May 21.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansa39-45.fr/mooreenglish.htm Charles Moore later recalls his escape on this webpage.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Denise Bachelier had entered one of the enduring mysteries and tragedies of Joué-du-Plain during World War II, and the subject of a book and two investigations. It was a tragedy for her as well; the Germans sent her and her 18-year-old younger brother to [[concentration camp]]s, her brother did not survive: he died shortly after being freed.

===Resistance===
{{Main|Résistance Joué-du-Plain and the Assassination of Emile Buffon|French Resistance}}
Chateau de la Motte was an arms depot for the Résistance, but its discovery by the Nazis brought an accusation of collaboration to the mayor of Joué-du-Plain. His assassination followed, possibly ordered by his brother. The events took place in and around the Chateau de la Motte.

On the day of the mayor's assassination, 16 July, just before dawn, a German [[Messerschmitt 109]] fighter smashed into the large pond at Château de la Motte. The pilot, Haibt Oswald, died immediately.
 
The crash illustrated the desperate situation the occupying army faced. Corporal Oswald was based near [[Chartres]]. He died along with two others shot down that day from his outnumbered and out-fueled group. Not only did he die on his first combat mission, but he probably had only four hours of total flying experience. German fuel shortages meant no fuel to practice; it was a costly on-the-job training.

In that same dogfight, Canadian Michael O'Kelly was a casualty from Britain's [[Royal Air Force]]. He is the only Allied soldier in the graveyard at Écouché.

The Allies under [[General George Patton]] approached from the south, but the German occupiers continued local oppression, by managing a withdrawal across the [[Rhine]] to mount a final defense.

After finding the arms depot, the Germans occupied the Château with soldiers living in the farmhouse and officers in the main house. The Germans installed a bakery on the Château farm grounds.

M. Noel continued distributing rationing coupons for several years after the war, as shortages continued. Noel's son and some of the female employees followed the Allied armies into Germany. The girls' school closed and the schoolmistress left, to rejoin her German boyfriend in Germany.

==After the Second World War==
In 1974, Fauvre, a [[Peugeot]] engineer bought La Motte along with his wife and their son.

In 1986, after Fauvre's death, Rhoisin Beresford, an Irish film director and the former wife of [[Bruce Beresford]] bought the Château from the son. Beresford was a noted director of ''[[Driving Miss Daisy]]'' and ''[[Terms of Endearment]]''. Because of her media links, numerous British notables passed through la Motte, including the heroine in the movie ''[[The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc]]'' starring [[Milla Jovovich]], filmed in nearby [[Sées]].

On December 26, 1999, the chateau suffered major tree damage from the [[Lothar]] Storm. The majority of the remaining heritage trees (with the notable exception of the lime trees) from the 18th century Chateau planting were lost.

In 2014, the current owner bought La Motte.&lt;ref name="chateaudelamottefrance.com"/&gt;

A '''confused deputy''' is a [[computer program]] that is innocently fooled by some other party into misusing its authority.  It is a specific type of [[privilege escalation]]. In [[information security]], the '''confused deputy problem''' is often cited as an example of why [[capability-based security]] is important, as capability systems protect against this, whereas [[access control list]]-based systems do not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterken.sourceforge.net/aclsdont/|title=ACLs don't|work=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==
[[File:Don Knotts Barney and the bullet Andy Griffith Show.jpg|thumb|Prototypical confused deputy [[Barney Fife]]]]
In the original example of a confused deputy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/ConfusedDeputy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2003-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031205034929/http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~KeyKOS/ConfusedDeputy.html |archivedate=2003-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is a program that provides [[Compiler|compilation]] services to other programs. Normally, the client program specifies the name of the input and output files, and the server is given the same access to those files that the client has.

The compiler service is pay-per-use, and the compiler service stores its billing information in a file (dubbed ''BILL'') that only it has access to.

Now suppose a client calls the service and names its output file ''BILL''. The service opens the output file. Even though the client did not have access to that file, the service does, so the open succeeds, and the server writes the compilation output to the file, overwriting it, and thus destroying the billing information.

=== The confused deputy ===
In this example, the compilation service is the deputy because it is acting at the request of the client. The service is confused because it was tricked into overwriting its billing file.

Whenever a program tries to access a file, the operating system needs to know two things: which file the program is asking for, and whether the program has permission to access the file. In the example, the file is designated by its name, “BILL”. The server receives the file name from the client, but does not know whether the client had permission to write the file. When the server opens the file, the system uses the server’s permission, not the client’s. When the file name was passed from the client to the server, the permission did not go along with it; the permission was increased by the system silently and automatically.

It is not essential to the attack that the billing file is designated by a name represented as a string. The essential points are that:
* the designator for the file does not carry the full authority needed to access the file;
* the server's own permission to the file is used implicitly.

== Physical world examples ==
[[Confidence trick]] based scams are based on gaining the trust of a victim in order for an attacker to use them as a confused deputy.  For example, in [[Salting (confidence trick)|Salting]], an attacker presents a victim with what appears to be a mineral-rich mine.  In this case an attacker is using a victim's greed to persuade them to perform an action that the victim would not normally do.

When checking out at a [[grocery store]], the [[cashier]] will scan the [[barcode]] of each item to determine the total cost.  A thief could replace barcodes on his items with those of cheaper items. In this attack the cashier is a confused deputy that is using seemingly valid barcodes to determine the total cost.

== Other examples ==
A [[cross-site request forgery]] (CSRF) is an example of a confused deputy attack that uses the [[web browser]] to perform sensitive actions against a web application.  A common form of this attack occurs when a web application uses a cookie to authenticate all requests transmitted by a browser.  Using JavaScript an attacker can force a browser into transmitting authenticated HTTP requests.

The [[Samy (computer worm)|Samy computer worm]] used [[cross-site scripting]] (XSS) to turn the browser's authenticated MySpace session into a confused deputy.  Using XSS the worm forced the browser into posting an executable copy of the worm as a MySpace message which was then viewed and executed by friends of the infected user.

[[Clickjacking]] is an attack where the user acts as the confused deputy.  In this attack a user thinks they are harmlessly browsing a website (an attacker-controlled website) but they are in fact tricked into performing sensitive actions on another website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://waterken.sourceforge.net/clickjacking/|title=clickjacking: The Confused Deputy rides again!|work=sourceforge.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[FTP bounce attack]] can allow an attacker to connect indirectly to TCP ports to which the attacker's machine has no access, using a remote [[FTP]] server as the confused deputy.

Another example relates to [[personal firewall]] software. It can restrict Internet access for specific applications. Some applications circumvent this by starting a browser with instructions to access a specific URL. The browser has authority to open a network connection, even though the application does not. Firewall software can attempt to address this by prompting the user in cases where one program starts another which then accesses the network. However, the user frequently does not have sufficient information to determine whether such an access is legitimate—false positives are common, and there is a substantial risk that even sophisticated users will become habituated to clicking "OK" to these prompts.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Spiessens: Patterns of Safe Collaboration, PhD thesis. http://www.evoluware.eu/fsp_thesis.pdf Section 8.1.5&lt;/ref&gt;

Not every program that misuses authority is a confused deputy. Sometimes misuse of authority is simply a result of a program error. The confused deputy problem occurs when the designation of an object is passed from one program to another, and the associated permission changes unintentionally, without any explicit action by either party. It is insidious because neither party did anything explicit to change the authority.

== Solutions ==
In some systems it is possible to ask the operating system to open a file using the permissions of another client. This solution has some drawbacks:
* It requires explicit attention to security by the server. A naive or careless server might not take this extra step.
* It becomes more difficult to identify the correct permission if the server is in turn the client of another service and wants to pass along access to the file.
* It requires the client to trust the server to not abuse the borrowed permissions. Note that intersecting the server and client's permissions does not solve the problem either, because the server may then have to be given very wide permissions (all of the time, rather than those needed for a given request) in order to act for arbitrary clients.

The simplest way to solve the confused deputy problem is to bundle together the designation of an object and the permission to access that object. This is exactly what a [[object-capability model|capability]] is.

Using capability security in the compiler example, the client would pass to the server a capability to the output file, such as a [[file descriptor]], rather than the name of the file. Since it lacks a capability to the billing file, it cannot designate that file for output.  In the [[cross-site request forgery]] example, a URL supplied "cross"-site would include its own authority independent of that of the client of the web browser.

'''Cytotaxonomy''' is the branch of biology dealing with the relationships and classification of organisms using comparative studies of chromosomes during meiosis.

==Description==
Cytotaxonomy is branch of taxonomy,which uses the characteristics of cellular structures,such as somatic chromosome to classify organism.Improvement in the cytological techniques permit chromosomal studies.The Study of primate chromosome is another very active field,which provide very much information on relationships(chiarelli,1996).
The number, structure, and behaviour of chromosomes is of great value in [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], with [[chromosome number]] being the most widely used and quoted character. Chromosome numbers are usually determined at [[mitosis]] and quoted as the [[diploid]] number (2n), unless dealing with a [[polyploid]] series in which case the base number or number of chromosomes in the genome of the original haploid is quoted. Another useful taxonomic character is the position of the [[centromere]]. [[Meiotic]] behaviour may show the [[heterozygosity]] of inversions. This may be constant for a taxon, offering further taxonomic evidence. Cytological data is regarded as having more significance than other taxonomic evidence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20896">'''Dynamical systems theory''' is an area of [[mathematics]] used to describe the behavior of the  [[complex systems|complex]] [[dynamical system]]s, usually by employing [[differential equations]] or [[difference equations]]. When differential equations are employed, the theory is called [[continuous time|''continuous dynamical systems'']]. From a physical point of view, continuous dynamical systems is a generalization of [[classical mechanics]], a generalization where the [[equations of motion]] are postulated directly and are not constrained to be [[Euler–Lagrange equation]]s of a [[Principle of least action|least action principle]]. When difference equations are employed, the theory is called [[discrete time|''discrete dynamical systems'']]. When the time variable runs over a set that is discrete over some intervals and continuous over other intervals or is any arbitrary time-set such as a [[cantor set]], one gets [[dynamic equations on time scales]]. Some situations may also be modeled by mixed operators, such as [[differential-difference equations]].

Much of modern research is focused on the study of [[chaotic system]]s.

This field of study is also called just ''dynamical systems'', ''mathematical dynamical systems theory'' or the ''mathematical theory of dynamical systems''.
[[Image:Lorenz attractor yb.svg|thumb|240px|right|The [[Lorenz attractor]] is an example of a [[non-linear]] dynamical system. Studying this system helped give rise to [[chaos theory]].]]

== Overview ==
Dynamical systems theory and [[chaos theory]] deal with the long-term qualitative behavior of [[dynamical system]]s. Here, the focus is not on finding precise solutions to the equations defining the dynamical system (which is often hopeless), but rather to answer questions like "Will the system settle down to a steady state in the long term, and if so, what are the possible steady states?", or "Does the long-term behavior of the system depend on its initial condition?"

An important goal is to describe the fixed points, or steady states of a given dynamical system; these are values of the variable that don't change over time. Some of these fixed points are ''attractive'', meaning that if the system starts out in a nearby state, it converges towards the fixed point.

Similarly, one is interested in ''periodic points'', states of the system that repeat after several timesteps. Periodic points can also be attractive. [[Sharkovskii's theorem]] is an interesting statement about the number of periodic points of a one-dimensional discrete dynamical system.

Even simple [[nonlinear dynamical system]]s often exhibit seemingly random behavior that has been called ''chaos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grebogi |first=C. |last2=Ott |first2=E. |last3=Yorke |first3=J. |year=1987 |title=Chaos, Strange Attractors, and Fractal Basin Boundaries in Nonlinear Dynamics |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=238 |issue=4827 |pages=632–638 |jstor=1700479 |doi=10.1126/science.238.4827.632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The branch of dynamical systems that deals with the clean definition and investigation of chaos is called ''[[chaos theory]]''.

== History ==
The concept of dynamical systems theory has its origins in [[Newtonian mechanics]]. There, as in other natural sciences and engineering disciplines, the evolution rule of dynamical systems is given implicitly by a relation that gives the state of the system only a short time into the future.

Before the advent of [[computer|fast computing machines]], solving a dynamical system required sophisticated mathematical techniques and could only be accomplished for a small class of dynamical systems.

Some excellent presentations of mathematical dynamic system theory include {{harv|Beltrami|1990}}, {{harv|Luenberger|1979}}, {{harv|Padulo|Arbib|1974}}, and {{harv|Strogatz|1994}}.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome R. Busemeyer (2008), [http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/Publications/techreps2000/241/241.html "Dynamic Systems"]. To Appear in: ''Encyclopedia of cognitive science'', Macmillan. Retrieved 8 May 2008.  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080613053119/http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/Publications/techreps2000/241/241.html |date=June 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concepts ==

=== Dynamical systems ===
{{main|Dynamical system (definition)}}
The [[dynamical system]] concept is a mathematical [[formal system|formalization]] for any fixed "rule" that describes the [[time]] dependence of a point's position in its [[ambient space]].  Examples include the [[mathematical model]]s that describe the swinging of a clock pendulum, the flow of water in a pipe, and the number of fish each spring in a lake.

A dynamical system has a ''state'' determined by a collection of [[real numbers]], or more generally by a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of [[Point (geometry)|points]] in an appropriate ''state space''.  Small changes in the state of the system correspond to small changes in the numbers.  The numbers are also the coordinates of a geometrical space—a [[manifold]].   The ''evolution rule'' of the dynamical system is a [[function (mathematics)|fixed rule]] that describes what future states follow from the current state.  The rule may be [[Deterministic system (mathematics)|deterministic]] (for a given time interval only one future state follows from the current state) or [[stochastic differential equation|stochastic]] (the evolution of the state is subject to random shocks).

=== Dynamicism ===
[[Dynamicism]], also termed the ''dynamic hypothesis'' or the ''dynamic hypothesis in cognitive science'' or ''dynamic cognition'', is a new approach in [[cognitive science]] exemplified by the work of philosopher [[Tim van Gelder]]. It argues that [[differential equations]] are more suited to modelling [[cognition]] than more traditional [[computer]] models.

=== Nonlinear system ===
{{main|Nonlinear system}}
In [[mathematics]], a [[nonlinear system]] is a system that is not [[linear system|linear]]—i.e., a system that does not satisfy the [[superposition principle]].&lt;ref name="Boeing2016Systems"/&gt; Less technically, a nonlinear system is any problem where the variable(s) to solve for cannot be written as a linear sum of independent components. A [[Homogeneity (physics)|nonhomogeneous]] system, which is linear apart from the presence of a function of the [[independent variable]]s, is nonlinear according to a strict definition, but such systems are usually studied alongside linear systems, because they can be transformed to a linear system as long as a particular solution is known.

== Related fields ==

=== Arithmetic dynamics ===
:[[Arithmetic dynamics]] is a field that emerged in the 1990s that amalgamates two areas of mathematics, [[dynamical systems]] and [[number theory]]. Classically, discrete dynamics refers to the study of the [[Iterated function|iteration]] of self-maps of the [[complex plane]] or [[real line]]. Arithmetic dynamics is the study of the number-theoretic properties of integer, rational, {{math|&lt;var&gt;p&lt;/var&gt;}}-adic, and/or algebraic points under repeated application of a [[polynomial]] or [[rational function]].

=== Chaos theory ===
:[[Chaos theory]] describes the behavior of certain [[dynamical system (definition)|dynamical system]]s – that is, systems whose state evolves with time – that may exhibit dynamics that are highly sensitive to initial conditions (popularly referred to as the [[butterfly effect]]). As a result of this sensitivity, which manifests itself as an exponential growth of perturbations in the initial conditions, the behavior of chaotic systems appears [[randomness|random]]. This happens even though these systems are [[deterministic system (philosophy)|deterministic]], meaning that their future dynamics are fully defined by their initial conditions, with no random elements involved. This behavior is known as deterministic chaos, or simply ''chaos''.

=== Complex systems ===
:[[Complex systems]] is a scientific field that studies the common properties of [[system]]s considered [[Complexity|complex]] in [[nature]], [[society]], and [[science]]. It is also called ''complex systems theory'', ''complexity science'', ''study of complex systems'' and/or ''sciences of complexity''. The key problems of such systems are  difficulties with their formal [[Scientific modelling|modeling]] and [[simulation]]. From such perspective, in different research contexts complex systems are defined on the base of their different attributes.

:The study of complex systems is bringing new vitality to many areas of science where a more typical [[reductionist]] strategy has fallen short. ''Complex systems'' is therefore often used as a broad term encompassing a research approach to problems in many diverse disciplines including [[neurosciences]], [[social sciences]], [[meteorology]], [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[artificial life]], [[evolutionary computation]], [[economics]], earthquake prediction, [[molecular biology]] and inquiries into the nature of living [[cell (biology)|cell]]s themselves.

=== Control theory ===
:[[Control theory]] is an interdisciplinary branch of [[engineering]] and [[mathematics]], that deals with influencing the behavior of [[dynamical system]]s.

=== Ergodic theory ===
:[[Ergodic theory]] is a branch of [[mathematics]] that studies [[dynamical system]]s with an [[invariant measure]] and related problems. Its initial development was motivated by problems of [[statistical physics]].

=== Functional analysis ===
:[[Functional analysis]] is the branch of [[mathematics]], and specifically of [[mathematical analysis|analysis]], concerned with the study of [[vector space]]s and [[operator (mathematics)|operator]]s acting upon them. It has its historical roots in the study of [[functional space]]s, in particular transformations of [[function (mathematics)|functions]], such as the [[Fourier transform]], as well as in the study of [[differential equations|differential]] and [[integral equations]]. This usage of the word ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' goes back to the [[calculus of variations]], implying a function whose argument is a function. Its use in general has been attributed to mathematician and physicist [[Vito Volterra]] and its founding is largely attributed to mathematician [[Stefan Banach]].

=== Graph dynamical systems ===
:The concept of [[graph dynamical system]]s (GDS) can be used to capture a wide range of processes taking place on graphs or networks. A major theme in the mathematical and computational analysis of graph dynamical systems is to relate their structural properties (e.g. the network connectivity) and the global dynamics that result.

=== Projected dynamical systems ===
:[[Projected dynamical systems]] is a [[mathematics|mathematical]] theory investigating the behaviour of [[dynamical system]]s where solutions are restricted to a constraint set. The discipline shares connections to and applications with both the static world of [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]] and [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium]] problems and the dynamical world of [[ordinary differential equations]]. A projected dynamical system is given by the [[flow (mathematics)|flow]] to the projected differential equation.

=== Symbolic dynamics ===
:[[Symbolic dynamics]] is the practice of modelling a topological or smooth [[dynamical system]] by a discrete space consisting of infinite [[sequence]]s of abstract symbols, each of which corresponds to a state of the system, with the dynamics (evolution) given by the [[shift operator]].

=== System dynamics ===
:[[System dynamics]] is an approach to understanding the behaviour of systems over time.  It deals with internal feedback loops and time delays that affect the behaviour and state of the entire system.&lt;ref name="sysdyn"&gt;[http://sysdyn.clexchange.org MIT System Dynamics in Education Project (SDEP)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509163801/http://sysdyn.clexchange.org/ |date=2008-05-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  What makes using system dynamics different from other approaches to studying systems is the use of [[feedback]] loops and [[Stock and flow|stocks and flows]].  These elements help describe how even seemingly simple systems display baffling [[nonlinearity]].

=== Topological dynamics ===
:[[Topological dynamics]] is a branch of the theory of dynamical systems in which qualitative, asymptotic properties of dynamical systems are studied from the viewpoint of [[general topology]].

== Applications ==

=== In biomechanics ===
In [[sports biomechanics]], dynamical systems theory has emerged in the movement sciences as a viable framework for modeling athletic performance. From a dynamical systems perspective, the human movement system is a highly intricate network of co-dependent sub-systems (e.g. respiratory, circulatory, nervous, skeletomuscular, perceptual) that are composed of a large number of interacting components (e.g. blood cells, oxygen molecules, muscle tissue, metabolic enzymes, connective tissue and bone). In dynamical systems theory, movement patterns emerge through generic processes of self-organization found in physical and biological systems.&lt;ref&gt;Paul S Glazier, Keith Davids, Roger M Bartlett (2003). [http://www.sportsci.org/jour/03/psg.htm "DYNAMICAL SYSTEMS THEORY: a Relevant Framework for Performance-Oriented Sports Biomechanics Research"]. in: Sportscience 7. Accessed 2008-05-08.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no research validation of any of the claims associated to the conceptual application of this framework.

=== In cognitive science ===
Dynamical system theory has been applied in the field of [[neurodynamics|neuroscience]] and [[cognitive science|cognitive development]], especially in [[the neo-Piagetian theories of cognitive development]]. It is the belief that cognitive development is best represented by physical theories rather than theories based on syntax and [[AI]]. It also believed that differential equations are the most appropriate tool for modeling human behavior. These equations are interpreted to represent an agent's cognitive trajectory through [[state space]]. In other words, dynamicists argue that [[psychology]] should be (or is) the description (via differential equations) of the cognitions and behaviors of an agent under certain environmental and internal pressures. The language of chaos theory is also frequently adopted.

In it, the learner's mind reaches a state of disequilibrium where old patterns have broken down. This is the phase transition of cognitive development. [[Self-organization]] (the spontaneous creation of coherent forms) sets in as activity levels link to each other. Newly formed macroscopic and microscopic structures support each other, speeding up the process. These links form the structure of a new state of order in the mind through a process called ''scalloping'' (the repeated building up and collapsing of complex performance.) This new, novel state is progressive, discrete, idiosyncratic and unpredictable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Promise of Dynamic Systems Approaches for an Integrated Account of Human Development|journal=Child Development|date=2000-02-25|first=Mark D.|last=Lewis|volume=71|issue=1|pages=36–43|id= |url=http://home.oise.utoronto.ca/~mlewis/Manuscripts/Promise.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1111/1467-8624.00116|pmid=10836556 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic systems theory has recently been used to explain a long-unanswered problem in child development referred to as the [[A-not-B error]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Development as a dynamic system|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date=2003-07-30|first=Linda B.|last=Smith|author2=Esther Thelen|volume=7|issue=8|pages=343–8|id= |url=http://www.indiana.edu/~cogdev/labwork/dynamicsystem.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2008-04-04|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00156-6|pmid=12907229}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In second language development===
{{Main|Dynamic approach to second language development}}
The application of Dynamic Systems Theory to study [[second language acquisition]] is attributed to [[Diane Larsen-Freeman]] who published an article in 1997 in which she claimed that [[second language acquisition]] should be viewed as a developmental process which includes [[language attrition]] as well as language acquisition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://academic.oup.com/applij/article-abstract/18/2/141/134192|title=Chaos/Complexity Science and Second Language Acquisition|date=1997|publisher=Applied Linguistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her article she claimed that language should be viewed as a dynamic system which is dynamic, complex, nonlinear, chaotic, unpredictable, sensitive to initial conditions, open, self-organizing, feedback sensitive, and adaptive.

'''Eles''' (also transliterated as ''Ellès'' and ''Al Las'') is a village in the [[Siliana Governorate]], Tunisia. It is located around  {{coord|35|56|55|N|9|5|50|E}} about 13&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Maktar]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://itouchmap.com/?c=ts&amp;UF=-724841&amp;UN=-1027397&amp;DG=PPL Eles, Tunisia] at itouchmap.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymaphq.com/tunisia/el_kef/ellez.html Eles, Tunisia at citymap.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Siliana Governorate]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mapmonde.org/africa/tunisia/gouvernorat-de-el-kef/ellez-852969/ Eles, Tunisia] at mapmondo.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eles, Tunisia sits over a natural spring at the base of the surrounding hills.

The village is notable for the large number of [[dolmen]]s found immediately to the west,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lexicorient.com/tunisia/elles.htm Description et photos du site d'Ellès (LookLex)]&lt;/ref&gt; thought to be from around 2500 BC.  BC.&lt;ref&gt;Belmonte, J. A. Esteban, C. and Jiménez González, J. J. (1998). «Pre-Roman Tombs of Africa Proconsularis»: S7–S24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harbi-Riahi, M. Gragueb, A. Camps, G. M'Timet, A.

In contrast Hoskin&lt;ref&gt;Hoskin 2001:206-8&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Tunisian dolmen orientations can be explained by the local topography, in that the entrances all face downhill.

The local rock strata are geologically interesting as they provide a particularly good record of the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary,&lt;ref&gt;Coccioni and Marsilia 2007&lt;/ref&gt; which is now better known as the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event]].

During the [[Roman Empire]] and [[late antiquity]] there was a ''[[civitas]]'' (Roman town) called Ululi.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/former/t1903.htm Titular Episcopal See of Ululi], at GCatholic.org.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.catholic-hierarchy.org/diocese/d2u08.html Ululensis] at catholic-hierarchy.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1627">Around 2006, the [[Government of China|Chinese Government]] instituted the admission of foreign students to [[China]] for medical instruction using [[English language|English]] as the language of instruction. Students are eligible to earn basic degrees in either Medicine ([[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery|MBBS]]) or Dentistry ([[Bachelor of Dental Surgery|BDS]]).

To ensure adequate quality control, only a few choice medical schools are allowed specific quotas for admitting international students into these programs. Other Chinese medical institutions are not barred from admitting international students, but the government maintains that these other students would have to be admitted into the medical programs taught in [[Chinese language|Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://202.205.177.9/english/tongzhi_070810.htm Interim provisions for Quality Control Standards on Undergraduate Medical Education in English for International Students in China]&lt;/ref&gt;

This list of universities is reviewed each year and currently{{when?|date=May 2018}} stands at 50 schools.

These schools are thus officially recognized by the [[Avicenna Directories|WHO]] and the [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|MOE]].

[[File:Map-of-Oz.jpg|thumb|300px|Map of the [[land of Oz]], the fictional realm that is the setting for [[L. Frank Baum]]'s "[[List of Oz books|Oz]]" series.]]
A '''fictional universe''' is a [[consistency|self-consistent]] [[setting (narrative)|setting]] with events, and often other elements, that differ from the real world. It may also be called an imagined, constructed or fictional realm (or world). Fictional universes may appear in [[novel]]s, [[comics]], [[film]]s, [[Television program|television shows]], [[video game]]s, and other creative works.

A fictional universe can be almost indistinguishable from the real world, except for the presence of the invented [[character (arts)|character]]s and events that characterize a work of fiction; at the other extreme, it can bear little or no resemblance to the real world, with invented fundamental principles of time and space.

The subject is most commonly addressed in reference to fictional universes that differ markedly from the real world, such as those that introduce entire fictional cities, countries, or even planets, or those that contradict commonly known facts about the world and its history, or those that feature fantasy or [[science fiction]] concepts such as [[Magic in fiction|magic]] or [[faster than light]] travel—and especially those in which the deliberate development of the setting is a substantial focus of the work.

==Definition==
What distinguishes a fictional universe from a simple setting is the level of detail and internal consistency. A fictional universe has an established continuity and internal logic that must be adhered to throughout the work and even across separate works. So, for instance, many books may be set in conflicting fictional versions of [[Victorian London]], but all the stories of [[Sherlock Holmes]] are set in ''the same'' Victorian London. However, the [[Adaptations of Sherlock Holmes|various film series based on Sherlock Holmes]]  follow their own separate continuities, thus not taking place in the same fictional universe.

The history and geography of a fictional universe are well defined, and maps and timelines are often included in works set within them. Even new [[fictional language|languages]] may be constructed. When subsequent works are written within the same universe, care is usually taken to ensure that established facts of the [[canon (fiction)|canon]] are not violated. Even if the fictional universe involves concepts such as elements of magic that don't exist in the real world, these must adhere to a set of rules established by the author.

A famous example of a detailed fictional universe is [[Arda (Middle-earth)|Arda]] (more popularly known as [[Middle-earth]]), of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s books ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' and ''[[The Silmarillion]]''.  He created first its [[Languages of Arda|languages]] and then the world itself, which he states was "primarily linguistic in inspiration and was begun in order to provide the necessary 'history' for the Elvish tongues."&lt;ref&gt;Foreword to ''[[The Fellowship of the Ring]]'', by J.R.R. Tolkien&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern example of a [[Fictional universe of Avatar|fictional universe]] is that of the ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' film series, as [[James Cameron]] has invented an entire [[Pandoran biosphere|ecosystem]], with a team of scientists to test whether it was viable. Additionally, he commissioned a linguistics expert to invent the [[Na'vi language|''Na'vi'' language]].

Virtually every successful fictional [[TV series]] or [[comic book]] develops its own "universe" to keep track of the various episodes or issues. Writers for that series must follow the ''[[Bible (writing)|story bible]]'',&lt;ref name="jane"&gt;[http://www.janeespenson.com/archives/00000550.php How to Give Maris Hives, Alphabetized] (April 2008), a blog entry by scriptwriter [[Jane Espenson]]&lt;/ref&gt; which often becomes the series canon.

Frequently, when a series is perceived by its creators as too complicated or too self-inconsistent (because of, for example, too many writers), the producers or publishers may introduce [[retroactive continuity]] (retcon) to make future editions easier to write and more consistent. This creates an alternate universe that future authors can write about. These stories about the universe or universes that existed before the retcon are usually not canonical, unless the franchise-holder gives permission. ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' was an especially sweeping example.

Some writers choose to introduce elements or characters from one work into another, to present the idea that both works are set in the same universe. For example, the character of [[Ursula Buffay]] from American [[sitcom]] ''[[Mad About You]]'' was also a recurring guest star in ''[[Friends]]'', despite the two series having little else in common. Fellow NBC series ''[[Seinfeld]]'' also contained [[Fictional crossover|crossover]] references to ''Mad About You''. [[L. Frank Baum]] introduced the characters of [[Cap'n Bill]] and [[Trot (Oz)|Trot]] (from ''[[The Sea Fairies]]'') into the Oz series in ''[[The Scarecrow of Oz]]'', and they made a number of appearances in later Oz books. In science fiction, [[A. Bertram Chandler]] introduced into his future Galactic civilization the character [[Dominic Flandry]] from [[Poul Anderson]]'s quite different Galactic future (he had Anderson's consent) – on the assumption that these were two [[alternate history]] timelines and that people could on some occasions cross from one to the other.

==Scope==
[[Sir Thomas More]]'s ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' is one of the earliest examples of a cohesive fictional world with its own rules and functional concepts, but it comprises only one small island. Later fictional universes, like [[Robert E. Howard]]'s ''[[Conan the Barbarian|Conan the Cimmerian]]'' stories or [[Lev Grossman]]'s [[Fillory]], are global in scope and some, like ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Honorverse]]'', ''[[BattleTech]]'', or the [[Lensman series]], are galactic or even intergalactic.

A fictional universe may even concern itself with more than one interconnected universe through fictional devices such as dreams, "[[time travel]]" or "parallel worlds". Such a series of interconnected universes is often called a [[parallel universe (fiction)|multiverse]]. Such multiverses have been featured prominently in science fiction since at least the mid-20th century.

The classic ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' episode "[[Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Mirror, Mirror]]" introduced the [[Mirror Universe (Star Trek)|Mirror Universe]], in which the crew members of the [[Starship Enterprise|Starship ''Enterprise'']] were brutal rather than compassionate. The 2009 movie ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' created an "alternate reality" and freed the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[media franchise|franchise]] from [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] issues. In the mid-1980s, [[DC Comics]] ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' streamlined its fictional continuity by destroying most of its alternate universes.

==Format==
A fictional universe can be contained in a single work, as in [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' or [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', or in [[serial (literature)|serial]]ized, [[book series|series]]-based, open-ended or [[Round-robin story|round robin]]-style fiction.

In most small-scale fictional universes, general properties and [[timeline]] events fit into a consistently organized [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. However, in the case of universes that are rewritten or revised by different [[writer]]s, [[editing|editors]], or [[Film producers|producer]]s, this continuity may be violated, by accident or by design.

The occasional publishing use of retroactive continuity ([[retcon]]) often occurs due to this kind of revision or oversight. Members of [[fandom]] often create a kind of [[fan-made]] canon ([[canon (fiction)#Nature of fictional canons|fanon]]) to patch up such errors; "fanon" that becomes generally accepted sometimes becomes actual canon. Other fan-made additions to a universe ([[fan fiction]], [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]], [[pastiche]], [[parody]]) are usually not considered canonical unless they get [[authorization|authorized]].

==Collaboration==
{{see also|Shared universe}}

Shared universes often come about when a fictional universe achieves great commercial success and attracts other media. For example, a successful movie may catch the attention of various book authors, who wish to write stories based on that movie. Under U.S. law, the copyright-holder retains control of all other [[derivative work]]s, including those written by other authors, but they might not feel comfortable in those other mediums or may feel that other individuals will do a better job; therefore, they may open up the copyright on a shared-universe basis. The degree to which the copyright-holder or [[franchise (media)|franchise]] retains control is often one of the points in the [[license agreement#Intellectual property|license agreement]].

For example, the comic book ''[[Superman (comic book)|Superman]]'' was so popular that it spawned over 30 different radio, television, and movie series and a similar number of [[video game]]s, as well as theme park rides, books, and songs. In the other direction, both ''Star Trek'' and ''Star Wars'' are responsible for hundreds of books and games of varying levels of canonicity.

Fictional universes are sometimes shared by multiple prose authors, with each author's works in that universe being granted approximately equal canonical status. For example, [[Larry Niven]]'s fictional universe [[Known Space]] has an approximately 135-year period in which Niven allows other authors to write stories about the [[Man-Kzin Wars]]. Other fictional universes, like the [[Ring of Fire series|''Ring of Fire'' series]], actively court canonical [[The Grantville Gazettes|stimulus from fans]], but gate and control the  changes through a formalized process and the final say of [[Eric Flint|the editor and universe creator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title =''[[Grantville Gazette III]]'' | others = [[Thomas Kidd (illustrator)|Thomas Kidd]] (cover art) | ISBN = 978-1-4165-0941-7 |id={{ISBN|1-4165-0941-0}} | publisher = [[Baen Books]] | last = [[Eric Flint|Flint, Eric]] and various others | pages = 311–313|quote=The print published and e-published Grantville Gazettes all contain a post book [[afterword]] detailing where and how to submit a manuscript to the fictional canon oversight process for the [[1632 series]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other universes are created by one or several authors but are intended to be used non-canonically by others, such as the fictional settings for [[game]]s, particularly [[role-playing game]]s and video games. Settings for the role-playing game ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'' are called [[campaign setting]]s; other games have also incorporated this term on occasion. [[Virtual world]]s are fictional worlds in which [[online]] computer games, notably [[MMORPG]]s and [[MUD]]s, take place. A [[fictional crossover]] occurs when two or more [[fictional character]]s, series or universes cross over with one another, usually in the context of a character created by one author or owned by one [[company (law)|company]] meeting a character created or owned by another. In the case where two fictional universes covering entire ''actual'' universes cross over, physical travel from one universe to another may actually occur in the course of the story. Such crossovers are usually, but not always, considered non-canonical by their creators or by those in charge of the [[intellectual property|properties]] involved.

[[File:Lucas Cranach - Der Jungbrunnen (Gemäldegalerie Berlin).jpg|right|thumb|407x407px|[[The Fountain of Youth (Cranach)|The ''Fountain of Youth'']], 1546 painting by [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]]]]

The '''Fountain of Youth''' is a [[spring (hydrosphere)|spring]] that supposedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks or bathes in its waters. Tales of such a fountain have been recounted across the world for thousands of years, appearing in writings by [[Herodotus]] (5th century BC), the [[Alexander romance]] (3rd century AD), and the stories of [[Prester John]] (early Crusades, 11th/12th centuries AD). Stories of similar waters were also evidently prominent among the [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Caribbean]] during the [[Age of Exploration]] (early 16th century), who spoke of the restorative powers of the water in the mythical land of [[Bimini#The Fountain of Youth|Bimini]].

The legend became particularly prominent in the 16th century, when it was attached to the Spanish explorer [[Juan Ponce de León]], first [[Governor of Puerto Rico]]. According to an apocryphal combination of New World and Eurasian elements, Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth when he traveled to what is now [[Florida]] in 1513. The legend says that Ponce de León was told by Native Americans that the Fountain of Youth was in Bimini and it could restore youth to anyone.

==Early accounts==
[[Herodotus]] mentions a fountain containing a special kind of water in the land of the [[Macrobians]], which gives the Macrobians their exceptional longevity.{{Quote|The [[Ichthyophagi]]d then in their turn questioned the king concerning the term of life, and diet of his people, and were told that most of them lived to be a hundred and twenty years old, while some even went beyond that age{{mdash}}they ate boiled flesh, and had for their drink nothing but milk. When the Ichthyophagi showed wonder at the number of the years, he led them to a fountain, wherein when they had washed, they found their flesh all glossy and sleek, as if they had bathed in oil- and a scent came from the spring like that of violets. The water was so weak, they said, that nothing would float in it, neither wood, nor any lighter substance, but all went to the bottom. If the account of this fountain be true, it would be their constant use of the water from it which makes them so long-lived.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, [[s:History of Herodotus/Book 3|Book III]]: 23&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Al-khidr.jpg|thumb|left|[[Persian miniature]] depicting [[Khidr]] and [[Alexander the Great|Alexander]] watching the Water of Life revive a salted fish]]

A story of the "Water of Life" appears in the Eastern versions of the [[Alexander romance]], which describes [[Alexander the Great]] and his servant crossing the [[Land of Darkness]] to find the restorative spring. The servant in that story is in turn derived from Middle Eastern legends of [[Al-Khidr]], a sage who appears also in the [[Qur'an]]. [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Aljamiado]] versions of the ''Alexander Romance'' were very popular in Spain during and after the period of [[Al-Andalus|Moorish rule]], and would have been known to the explorers who journeyed to America. These earlier accounts inspired the popular medieval fantasy ''[[John Mandeville|The Travels of Sir John Mandeville]]'', which also mentions the Fountain of Youth as located at the foot of a mountain outside Polombe (modern [[Kollam]]&lt;ref&gt;Kohanski, Tamarah &amp; Benson, C. David (Eds.) ''The Book of John Mandeville''. Medieval Institute Publications (Kalamazoo), 2007. "[http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/tkap2.htm Indexed Glossary of Proper Names]".

Accessed 24 Sept 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of these tales, the Fountain of Youth legend was popular in courtly [[Gothic art]], appearing for example on the ivory [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)]] and several ivory mirror-cases, and remained popular through the European [[Age of Exploration]].&lt;ref name="Peck"&gt;{{cite web|author=Peck, Douglas T|title=Misconceptions and Myths Related to the Fountain of Youth and Juan Ponce de Leon's 1513 Exploration Voyage|url=http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=New World Explorers, Inc|accessdate=2008-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080409062720/http://www.newworldexplorersinc.org/FountainofYouth.pdf|archivedate=2008-04-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:French - Mirror Cover with the Fountain of Youth - Walters 71170.jpg|thumb|French 14th-century ivory mirror case with a ''Fountain of Youth'']]

European [[iconography]] is fairly consistent, as the [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Cranach]] painting and mirror-case from 200 years earlier demonstrate: old people, often carried, enter at left, strip, and enter a pool that is as large as space allows. The people in the pool are youthful and naked, and after a while they leave it, and are shown fashionably dressed enjoying a courtly party, sometimes including a meal.

There are countless indirect sources for the tale as well. [[Eternal youth]] is a gift frequently sought in myth and legend, and stories of things such as the [[philosopher's stone]], [[universal panacea]]s, and the [[elixir of life]] are common throughout [[Eurasia]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Finding the Fountain of Youth: The Science and Controversy Behind Extending Life and Cheating Death|last=Zorea|first=Aharon|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2017|isbn=978-1440837982|location=Westport, CT|pages=35–39|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional hint may have been taken from the account of the [[Pool of Bethesda]] in the [[Gospel of John]], in which [[Jesus]] heals a man at the pool in [[Jerusalem]].

==Bimini==
{{main|Bimini#The Fountain of Youth}}
According to legend, the Spanish heard of Bimini from the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]]s in [[Hispaniola]], [[Cuba]], and [[Puerto Rico]]. The Caribbean islanders described a mythical land of ''Beimeni'' or ''Beniny'' (whence [[Bimini]]), a land of wealth and prosperity, which became conflated with the fountain legend. By the time of Ponce de Leon, the land was thought to be located northwest towards the Bahamas (called ''la Vieja'' during the Ponce expedition). The natives were probably referring to the area occupied by the [[Maya civilization|Maya]].&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; This land also became confused with the [[Boinca]] or [[Boyuca]] mentioned by [[Juan de Solis]], although Solis's navigational data placed it in the [[Gulf of Honduras]]. It was this Boinca that originally held a legendary fountain of youth, rather than Bimini itself.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; [[Sequene]], an Arawak chief from [[Cuba]], purportedly was unable to resist the lure of Bimini and its restorative fountain. He gathered a troupe of adventurers and sailed north, never to return.

Found within the salt water [[mangrove]] swamp that covers {{convert|6|km|mi}} of the shoreline of North Bimini is ''The Healing Hole'', a pool that lies at the end of a network of winding underground tunnels. During outgoing tides, these channels pump cool, [[Mineral water|mineral-laden]] fresh water into the pool. Because this well was carved out of the limestone rock by ground water thousands of years ago it is especially high in calcium and [[magnesium]].{{cn|date=February 2017}} Magnesium, which has been shown to improve longevity and reproductive health,&lt;ref&gt;EPIDEMIOLOGY OF WATER MAGNESIUM;EVIDENCE OF CONTRIBUTIONS TO HEALTH

==Ponce de León==
[[File:Ponce de León.jpg|thumb| 19th-century German artist’s impression of [[Juan Ponce de León]] and his explorers drinking from a spring in [[Florida]] while supposedly seeking the Fountain of Youth]]
In the 16th century the story of the Fountain of Youth became attached to the biography of the [[conquistador]] [[Juan Ponce de León]]. As attested by his royal charter, Ponce de León was charged with discovering the land of ''[[Bimini|Beniny]]''.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; Although the indigenous peoples were probably describing the land of the [[Maya peoples|Maya]] in [[Yucatán region|Yucatán]], the name{{mdash}}and legends about Boinca's fountain of youth{{mdash}}became associated with the [[Bahamas]] instead. However, Ponce de León did not mention the fountain in any of his writings throughout the course of his expedition.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt;

The connection was made in [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]]'s ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'' of 1535, in which he wrote that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of Bimini to regain youthfulness.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo. ''Historia general y natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that Oviedo's account may have been politically inspired to generate favor in the courts.&lt;ref name="Peck"/&gt; A similar account appears in [[Francisco López de Gómara]]'s ''Historia general de las Indias'' of 1551.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco López de Gómara. ''Historia general de las Indias'', second part.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Memoir'' of [[Hernando d'Escalante Fontaneda]] in 1575, the author places the restorative waters in Florida and mentions de León looking for them there; his account influenced [[Antonio de Herrera y Tordesillas]]' unreliable history of the Spanish in the New World.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda&gt;[http://www.keyshistory.org/Fontenada.html "Fontaneda's Memoir"]. Translation by Buckingham Smith, 1854. From keyshistory.org. Retrieved July 14, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Fontaneda had spent seventeen years as an Indian captive after being shipwrecked in Florida as a boy. In his ''Memoir'' he tells of the curative waters of a lost river he calls "[[Jordan River (symbolism)|Jordan]]" and refers to de León looking for it. However, Fontaneda makes it clear he is skeptical about these stories he includes, and says he doubts de León was actually looking for the fabled stream when he came to Florida.&lt;ref name=Fontaneda /&gt;

Herrera makes that connection definite in the romanticized version of Fontaneda's story included in his ''Historia general de los hechos de los Castellanos en las islas y tierra firme del Mar Oceano''. Herrera states that local [[cacique]]s paid regular visits to the fountain. A frail old man could become so completely restored that he could resume "all manly exercises … take a new wife and beget more children." Herrera adds that the Spaniards had unsuccessfully searched every "river, brook, lagoon or pool" along the Florida coast for the legendary fountain.&lt;ref&gt;[[Samuel Eliot Morison]], ''The European Discovery of America: The Southern Voyages 1492{{ndash}}1616'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1974), p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park==
{{main|Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park}}
[[File:Fountain of Youth postcard.jpg|thumb|Postcard from the Fountain of Youth in St. Augustine]]
The city of [[St. Augustine, Florida]], is home to the Fountain of Youth Archaeological Park, a tribute to the spot where Ponce de León was supposed to have landed according to promotional literature, although there is no historical or archaeological evidence to support the claim. There were several instances of the property being used as an attraction as early as the 1860s; the tourist attraction in its present form was created by Luella Day McConnell in 1904. Having abandoned her practice as a physician in Chicago and gone to the [[Yukon]] during the [[Klondike gold rush]] of the 1890s, she purchased the Park property in 1904 from Henry H. Williams, a British horticulturalist, with cash and diamonds, for which she became known in St. Augustine as "Diamond Lil". Around the year 1909 she began advertising the attraction, charging admission, and selling post cards and water from a well dug in 1875 for Williams by Philip Gomez and Philip Capo.&lt;ref name="KimJonesNPS2016"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Sujin Kim |author2=Robert 0.

The exact spot of the landing will probably never be known. The claim that the actual site of the landing has been definitely established at the Fountain of Youth Park seems unsupported by satisfactory evidence. The Fountain of Youth seems to be a well, not a spring, and to be without authenticated historical importance. One gets the impression that an effort is made to give the tourists their money's worth and to popularize history with such revisions as will best serve the gate receipts, and that in so doing historical accuracy has suffered.}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConnell later claimed to have "discovered" on the grounds a large cross made of [[coquina]] rock, asserting it was placed there by Ponce de León himself. She continued to fabricate stories to amuse and appall the city's residents and tourists until her death in a car accident in 1927. 

Walter B. Fraser, a transplant from Georgia who managed McConnell's attraction, then bought the property and made it one of the state's most successful tourist attractions.&lt;ref name="Clark2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=James C. Clark|title=A Concise History of Florida|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iBl3CQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT22|date=23 September 2014|publisher=Arcadia Publishing Incorporated|isbn=978-1-62585-153-6|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first archaeological digs at the Fountain of Youth were performed in 1934 by the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. These digs produced a large number of Christianized [[Timucua]] burials. These burials eventually pointed to the Park as the location of the first Christian mission in the United States. Called the [[Mission Nombre de Dios]], this mission was begun by Franciscan friars in 1587. Succeeding decades have seen the unearthing of items which positively identify the Park as the location of [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]]'s 1565 settlement of St. Augustine, the oldest continuously inhabited European settlement in North America. The park currently exhibits native and colonial artifacts to celebrate St. Augustine's Timucua and Spanish heritage.

'''Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von Erdmannsdorff''' (18 May 1736 &amp;ndash; 9 March 1800) was a [[Germany|German]] [[architect]] and [[architectural theoretician]], and one of the most significant representatives of early German [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassicism]] during the [[Age of Enlightenment]]. His work included Wörlitz Palace in the present-day [[Dessau-Wörlitz Garden Realm]], one of the earliest [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] buildings on the European continent. His most well-known student was [[Friedrich Gilly]], the teacher of [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]].

==Life==
Erdmannsdorff was born in [[Dresden]] to the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] courtier, Baron Ernst Ferdinand von Erdmannsdorff, and his wife Henriette Margarethe, née von Heßler.
[[File:LeopoldIIILisiewsky.jpg|thumb|left|Prince Franz von Anhalt-Dessau, portrait by [[Christoph Friedrich Reinhold Lisiewski]] (1762)]]
After early stages of education with [[Jakob Mauvillon]] in [[Leipzig]] and at the Dresden [[knight academy]] from 1750 to 1754, Erdmannsdorff attended the [[Martin Luther University of Halle-Wittenberg|University of Wittenberg]] in 1754–1758, where he encountered Prince [[Leopold III, Duke of Anhalt-Dessau|Franz von Anhalt-Dessau]], whose service he entered in 1758. His later fame is due his works for the prince in his [[Wörlitz]] pleasureground near the [[Dessau]] residence. At the age of twenty three Erdmannsdorff become a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]] and was initiated at the illustrious ''Minerva Zu Den Drei Palmen'' (Minerva to the three palm trees) lodge on 23 August 1759.

In accordance with the educational ideals of the Enlightenment, the prince had the aim of reorganising his surrounding lands into a cohesive 'Garden Realm' (''Gartenreich'') in the style of an [[English landscape garden]]. In addition to the beautification of the landscape, cottages of various architectural styles, antique temples, bridges and memorials were to be erected and to be made accessible to everyone. Franz employed his friend and architect Erdmannsdorff to design the architectural arrangement of the grounds.

Between 1761 and 1775 on several [[grand tour]]s to Italy, Holland, England, France and Switzerland, Erdmannsdorff gathered ideas for the architectural arrangement of the Wörlitz grounds. Accompanying the Prince, he got to know the style of the Scottish architects [[Robert Adam|Robert]] and [[James Adam (architect)|James Adam]] (the ''Adams Style''). At the same time he was impressed by the architect [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]]. In [[Rome]] Erdmannsdorff made the acquaintance of the archaeologist [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] and the painter [[Charles Louis Clérisseau]], and contacted the master builder [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] and painter [[Jakob Philipp Hackert]].

The contemporary art and culture of England made a particular impression on Erdmannsdorff as well as Prince Franz. The Palladian architecture in England, inspired by the [[Palladian villas of Veneto|Palladian Villas]] of the 16th century, can be seen replicated in Erdmannsdorff's later creations and was the strongest influence on his work next to the architecture and interior design of ancient Rome. In this artistic context he designed, amongst others, Wörlitz Palace, built from 1769 to 1773 for Prince Franz and his consort [[Margravine Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt|Louise of Brandenburg-Schwedt]].

Although Erdmannsdorff favoured this particular architectural style, he also created buildings in the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Neo-Gothic]] style preferred by Prince Franz. Among others, he converted the influences he had received on his trip to England into the building of the ''Gothic House'' in the Wörlitz Grounds.

During his time in Anhalt-Dessau, Erdmannsdorff married Wilhelmine von Ahlimb in 1781, with whom he had two daughters.

In 1786 King [[Frederick William II of Prussia]] called on his services to redecorate the bedroom and study of his predecessor, [[Frederick the Great]], in [[Sanssouci]] Palace in [[Potsdam]], as well a number of rooms in the [[Berliner Stadtschloss]] (Berlin City Palace). Consequently, the first consistently classical interior of the Potsdam and Berlin palaces was built to Erdmannsdorff's specifications. During his stay in Berlin and Potsdam which lasted until 1789, he became an honorary member of the '[[Prussian Academy of Arts|Royal Academy of Arts and Mechanical Sciences]]' in Berlin. Apart from this work he was above all active as a consultant in the areas of art, culture and education in Brandenburg.

Between 1789 and 1790, Erdmannsdorff stayed again in Italy. In Rome he made the acquaintance of the painters [[Angelica Kauffman]] and [[Jakob Phillipp Hackert]], as well as the sculptors [[Alexander Trippel]], [[Antonio Canova]] and [[Bartolomeo Cavaceppi]]. After a trip to [[Weimar]] in 1791 with Prince Franz, he visited the courts of [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], [[Kassel]] and [[Karlsruhe]]. In 1796 he took over the artistic direction of the ''Chalkographische Gesellschaft'' in Dessau, founded in 1795, whose goal was to popularise artistic works through etchings. At this time he also worked as a lecturer at the Berlin School of Architecture, where he taught [[Friedrich Gilly]] among others.

Erdmannsdorff died in Dessau at the age of 64. His grave can be found at the New Graveyard (''Neuer Begräbnisplatz'', today known as Historical Cemetery I) in Dessau.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2372">'''Interpret Scotland''' is an inter-agency initiative between [[Scotland|Scottish]] organisations concerned with [[heritage interpretation]]. It was begun in 1997 and its key aims are to :

* Improve the quality and quantity of interpretation in Scotland
* Promote the co-ordination of interpretation at local and strategic level
* Share resources, expertise and experience to avoid duplicating effort

The Interpret Scotland journal, which is published twice a year, has been running since 2000 and includes articles on all facets of interpretation. Interpret Scotland can be credited with raising awareness of professional heritage interpretation within Scotland, particularly through inter-agency support and networking.

Together with the [[Association for Heritage Interpretation]], Interpret Scotland established a steering group which planned and carried out [[The Vital Spark Interpretation Conference]].

== List of members ==

The Interpret Scotland steering group has expanded over the years and currently consists of :-

* Association for Scottish Visitor Attractions
* [[Council for Scottish Archaeology]]
* [[Forestry Commission]] Scotland
* [[Highlands and Islands Enterprise]]
* [[Historic Scotland]]
* [[Museums Galleries Scotland]]
* [[National Archives of Scotland]]
* [[National Galleries of Scotland]]
* [[National Museums of Scotland]]
* [[The National Trust for Scotland]]
* [[Royal Botanic Gardens Edinburgh]]
* [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]]
* [[Scottish Enterprise]]
* [[Scottish Natural Heritage]]
* Scottish Tourist Guides Association
* [[Scottish Wildlife Trust]]
* [[VisitScotland]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="978">The '''Johnsen–Rahbek effect''' occurs when an [[electric potential]] is applied across the boundary between a [[metal]]lic surface and the surface of a [[semiconductor|semiconducting material]].  Under these conditions an attractive force appears, whose magnitude depends on the voltage and the specific materials involved.

The effect is named after Danish engineers F. A. Johnsen and K. Rahbek, the first to investigate the effect at length.

'''Lewis &amp; Clark College''' is a private [[liberal arts college]] in the [[Pacific Northwest|northwest]] [[United States]], located in [[Portland, Oregon]].  It has an undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences, a School of Law, and a Graduate School of Education and Counseling.

Lewis &amp; Clark is a member of the [[Annapolis Group]] of colleges with athletic programs competing in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division III|Division III]] [[Northwest Conference]]. Just over 2,000 students attend the undergraduate College of Arts and Sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/college/offices/admissions/facts_and_figures|title=Facts &amp; Figures - Admissions - College of Arts and Sciences - Lewis &amp; Clark|website=Lclark.edu|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a student body from more than 50&amp;nbsp;countries across six continents as well as most U.S.&amp;nbsp;states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lclark.edu/offices/international/admissions/|title=International Admissions - International Students and Scholars - Lewis &amp; Clark|website=Lclark.edu|accessdate=6 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Law is best known for its [[environmental law]] program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/environmental-law-rankings |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403220407/http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/environmental-law-rankings |archivedate=2016-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the Graduate School of Education &amp; Counseling is active in community engagement and social justice.

It was originally chartered as the '''Albany Collegiate Institute''' in [[Albany, Oregon|Albany]], about {{convert|70|mi|spell=in}} south. The school moved to the Portland campus in 1938 and in 1942 adopted the name Lewis &amp; Clark College after the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]]. Today, the three schools and their supporting offices occupy the {{nowrap|{{convert|137|acre|km2|adj=on}}}} campus, centered on the [[M.&amp;nbsp;Lloyd Frank Estate]] on Palatine Hill in the [[Collins View, Portland, Oregon|Collins View]] neighborhood of Southwest Portland.

==History==
[[File:Albany College Administration Building.png|thumb|left|Albany College Administration Building.]]
Like many modern universities, the institution that would eventually become Lewis &amp; Clark was initially intended to provide secondary as well as higher education for a specific religious community, in this case [[Presbyterian]] pioneers in Oregon's [[Willamette Valley]]. To this end the Presbyterian church incorporated Albany Academy in 1858,&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;Corning, Howard M. ''Dictionary of Oregon History''. Binfords &amp; Mort Publishing, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; making Lewis &amp; Clark one of four Oregon colleges with foundations predating Oregon's statehood (along with [[Willamette University]], [[Pacific University]], and [[Linfield College]]).

Within a decade of its founding, Albany Academy began to focus more exclusively on higher education, changing its official name to the Albany Collegiate Institution in 1866. Lewis &amp; Clark's official founding date comes from the current charter, which has been legally valid since the Presbyterian church reincorporated the Albany Collegiate Institution as Albany College in 1867.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; Unlike most Oregon colleges of the pioneer-era, the college has been coeducational since the first class, which graduated in 1873. The early campus of {{convert|7|acre|spell=in}} in Albany was situated on land donated by the Monteith family. In 1892, the original school building was enlarged, and in 1925 the school relocated south of Albany where it remained until 1937.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt;

Albany College established a junior college to the north in Portland in 1934, with the entire school moving to Portland in 1939.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; The campus grounds later became home to the federal government's [[Albany Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942 the college trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store [[Meier &amp; Frank]]) "Fir Acres" estate in southwest Portland, and the school name was changed to Lewis &amp; Clark College.&lt;ref name=Oregon/&gt; The original school mascot, the Pirates, was changed to the Pioneers in 1946.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7885">'''Mamai–Hora''' is the largest multicomplex burial mound of national importance in the Northern Black Sea region. It is located on the left bank of the [[Kakhovka Reservoir]] near the village of [[Великая Знамянка|Velyka Znamianka]] in [[Kamianka-Dniprovska Raion|Kamiansko-Dniprovsk district]], [[Zaporizhia Oblast|Zaporizhzhia oblast]].

== History of site studies ==
The plan of the burial ground was first drawn by [[Boris Grakov|B. N. Grakovs's]] expedition in 1946–1947; later in 1976 it was edited by the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. In 1988 a study was carried out by the archaeological expedition led by G. M. Toshchev and S. I. Andrukh. The first years of excavations were focused on studying of small hillocks. In the early 90s, aerial photography and an additional topographical survey were carried out.  As a result, both hundreds of separate "spots" and joined ones were documented.  Also, the approximate boundaries of the burial mound were determined; its size covered some 30 ha. It is possible that the original footprint of the site was substantially larger, and reduced considerably due to the loss of more than 300 meters of shoreline after the [[Kakhovka Reservoir]] was created. Supporting this conjecture, destroyed burials in close proximity to the water have been unearthed. Since the middle of the 90s, archaeological work have been done manually. In total, about 8 hectares of the site have been studied. More than 600 funeral complexes, concentrated in burial mounds and soil burial grounds or individual burials have been identified.

== Cultures ==

=== Neolithic and Eneolithic periods ===
26 [[Neolithic]] and 4 [[Eneolithic]] burials were discovered in total. The grave goods are represented by clay pottery and adornments made of red deer teeth. [[Inhumation]] was carried out both in soil burial grounds and burial mounds.

=== The Bronze Age ===
A tradition of erecting burial mounds ([[kurgan]]s) became widespread in the [[Bronze Age]]. The burials of all known cultures of that age have been found in the earthen hillocks studied at Mamai-Hora, i.e. the [[Pit-Grave]], [[Catacomb]], [[Multi-cordoned ware culture|Multiroller ceramics]] and [[Srubna culture|Logs cultures]]. Each of them had its own specific funeral practices, burial rites and grave goods made of clay, bronze, stone, and flint. Trees were often used in burials, namely oak and ash. A vault was revealed next to one of the mounds, that was a pit with ore from which the paint was burned and a lavishly ornamented Catacomb culture vessel found.

==== The Pit-Grave culture ====
The [[Pit-Grave]] culture is represented by 14 locations, both burial mounds and burial grounds. Grave goods – decorated pottery.

==== The Catacomb culture ====
The main [[Catacomb culture]] burials are soil burials, but several of them were dug into the Eneolithic period burial mounds. In total there are 33 burials. Grave goods are sparse, represented by clay pottery and cult axes.

==== The Multiroller ceramics culture ====
There are only nine burials of the Babyno culture ([[Multi-cordoned ware culture|Multiroller ceramics culture]]).

==== The Bilozerska culture ====
The Bilozerska culture soil burial ground contains 5 burials.

==== The Novocherkassk culture ====
The fault line between the Bronze Age and the early Iron Age is marked by two burials of the [[Novocherkassk culture]].&lt;ref&gt;Тощев Г. Н. Памятники предскифского времени на Мамай-Горе // Древнее Причерноморье. – IX. – Одесса, ФЛП «Фридман А. С.», 2011. — С. 494—495&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Scythians === 
The earliest [[Scythian]] burial dates to the end of the VII-VI centuries BC. The rest of the complexes come from the period of the 5th–4th centuries BC. The total number of burials from this period is 370.&lt;ref&gt;Андрух С. И., Тощев Г. Н.

Fialko the [[Amazons]] were buried in many of them.&lt;ref&gt;Фиалко E. Е. Погребения амазонок из могильника Мамай-Гора // Stratum plus. 2010. №3. – С. 187—196&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of cult pits (amphorae fragments, molded ceramics, bones of animals) located on the periphery of the Scythian burial ground refer to this time as well.&lt;ref&gt;Андрух С. И. Могильник Мамай-Гора. Кн. ІІ. – Запорожье, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The grave goods are varied. This is pottery both locally produced and imported from the Greek centers. Weaponry is represented by differently sized swords, darts, spear points and arrowheads. Amidst adornments, there are bracelets, hryvnias, pendants, earrings, rings, plaques and beads. A [[Sarmatian]] burial was inlet into the Scythian kurhan.

=== The Polovtsians ===
Two [[Polovtsian]] soil burials have been excavated. The rest were inlet into earlier-period hillocks or formed independent complexes. 25 burials were revealed. The varied grave goods are represented by ornaments, household objects, and weapons.

=== The Golden Horde ===
A burial ground dating back to the 1st half of 14th century has been excavated. 19 nomadic burials and a cult pit of the [[Golden Horde]] period have been researched. Weapons, details of horse harnesses, belt buckles, earrings, awls, beads, and remains of headwear were found in male burials; ornaments, household objects, and remains of headwear in female burials. Beads were found in children's burials. A kurgan burial ground dating back to the mid-second half of the XIV century has also been found. In all 23 burials were revealed. The main burials were in five hillocks, while  the rest were inlet into the Scythian period kurgans. Also, 700 meters to the south of Mamai-Hora burial mounds, the Mamai-Surka burial ground dating back to the end of the 13th and beginning of the 15th century was researched. 1162 of its burials were studied.&lt;ref&gt;Ельников М.

=== The Late Middle Ages ===
A new surge of active use of the site as a cemetery can be dated to the 15th century. In 2015, 126 graves forming a soil burial ground dating to this time were discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Тощев А. Г.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12892">'''Microbial inoculants''' also known as '''soil inoculants''' are agricultural amendments that use beneficial [[endophytes]] (microbes) to promote plant health. Many of the microbes involved form symbiotic relationships with the target crops where both parties benefit ([[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]). While microbial inoculants are applied to improve plant nutrition, they can also be used to promote plant growth by stimulating plant hormone production (Bashan &amp; Holguin, 1997; Sullivan, 2001).

Research into the benefits of inoculants in agriculture extends beyond their capacity as [[biofertilizer]]s. Microbial inoculants can induce [[systemic acquired resistance]] (SAR) of crop species to several common crop diseases (provides resistance against pathogens). So far SAR has been demonstrated for powdery mildew (''Blumeria graminis'' f. sp. ''hordei'', Heitefuss, 2001), take-all (''Gaeumannomyces graminis'' var. ''tritici'', Khaosaad ''et al.'', 2007), leaf spot (''Pseudomonas syringae'', Ramos Solano ''et al.'', 2008) and root rot (''[[Fusarium]] culmorum'', Waller ''et al.'' 2005).

==Bacterial==

===Rhizobacterial inoculants===
The [[rhizobacteria]] commonly applied as inoculants include nitrogen-fixers and phosphate-solubilisers which enhance the availability of the macronutrients nitrogen and phosphorus to the host plant. Such bacteria are commonly referred to as plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR).

====Nitrogen-fixing bacteria====
The most commonly applied rhizobacteria are ''[[Rhizobium]]'' and closely related genera. ''Rhizobium'' are [[nitrogen-fixing]] bacteria that form symbiotic associations within nodules on the roots of [[legumes]]. This increases host nitrogen nutrition and is important to the cultivation of soybeans, chickpeas  and many other leguminous crops. For non-leguminous crops, ''Azospirillum'' has been demonstrated to be beneficial in some cases for nitrogen fixation and plant nutrition (Bashan &amp; Holguin, 1997).

For cereal crops, diazotrophic rhizobacteria have increased plant growth,&lt;ref&gt;Galal, Y. G. M., El-Ghandour, I. A., Osman, M. E. &amp; Abdel Raouf, A. M. N. (2003), The e ffect of inoculation by mycorrhizae and rhizobium on the growth and yield of wheat in relation to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization as assessed by 15n techniques, Symbiosis, 34(2), 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt; grain yield (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992), nitrogen and phosphorus uptake,&lt;ref&gt;Galal, Y. G. M., El-Ghandour, I. A., Osman, M. E. &amp; Abdel Raouf, A. M. N. (2003), The e ffect of inoculation by mycorrhizae and rhizobium on the growth and yield of wheat in relation to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization as assessed by 15n techniques, Symbiosis, 34(2), 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt; and nitrogen (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992), phosphorus (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992; Belimov ''et al.'', 1995) and potassium content (Caballero-Mellado ''et al.'', 1992). Rhizobacteria live in root nodes, and are associated with legumes.

====Phosphate-solubilising bacteria====
To improve phosphorus nutrition, the use of phosphate-solubilising bacteria (PSB) such as ''Agrobacterium radiobacter'' has also received attention (Belimov ''et al.'', 1995a; 1995b; Singh &amp; Kapoor, 1999). As the name suggests, PSB are free-living bacteria that break down inorganic soil phosphates to simpler forms that enable uptake by plants.

==Fungal inoculants==
Several different fungal inoculants (typically referred to as [[mycorrhizae]]) have been explored for their benefits to plant nutrition. Fungal inoculation has been observed to
benefit plant success and improve soil quality. The most commonly investigated fungi for this purpose are the [[arbuscular mycorrhizae]] (AM or AMF). [[Ectomycorrhizae]] are often symbiotic with coniferous species. Other [[endophytic]] fungi, such as ''Piriformis indica'' can also be beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, F., Achatz, B., Baltruschat, H., Fodor, J., Becker, K., Fischer, M., Heier, T., Hückelhoven, R., Neumann, C., von Wettstein, D. and Franken, P., 2005. The endophytic fungus Piriformospora indica reprograms barley to salt-stress tolerance, disease resistance, and higher yield. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, 102(38), pp.13386-13391.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
===Fungal partners===

Fungal inoculation alone can benefit host
plants. Inoculation paired with other amendments can further improve
conditions. Arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation combined with [[compost]] is a
common household amendment for personal gardens, agriculture, and nurseries. It
has been observed that this pairing can also promote microbial functions in
soils that have been affected by [[mining]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohler, J., Caravaca, F., Azcón, R., Díaz, G. and Roldán, A. (2015). The combination of compost addition and arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation produced positive and synergistic effects on the phytomanagement of a semiarid mine tailing. Science of the Total Environment, 514, pp.42-48.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain fungal partners do best in specific
[[ecotones]] or with certain crops. [[Arbuscular mycorrhizal]] inoculation paired with plant
growth promoting bacteria resulted in a higher yield and quicker maturation in
upland rice patties.&lt;ref&gt;Diedhiou, A., Mbaye, F., Mbodj, D., Faye, M., Pignoly, S., Ndoye, I., Djaman, K., Gaye, S., Kane, A., Laplaze, L., Manneh, B. and Champion, A. (2016). Field Trials Reveal Ecotype-Specific Responses to Mycorrhizal Inoculation in Rice. PLOS ONE, 11(12), p.e0167014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Maize growth improved after an amendment of
arbuscular mycorrhizae and [[biochar]]. This amendment can also decrease
[[cadmium]] uptake by crops.&lt;ref&gt;Liu, L., Li, J., Yue, F., Yan, X., Wang, F., Bloszies, S. and Wang, Y. (2018). Effects of arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculation and biochar amendment on maize growth, cadmium uptake and soil cadmium speciation in Cd-contaminated soil. Chemosphere, 194, pp.495-503.
&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects===

The effects of mycorrhizal inoculation include increased nutrient uptake and [[seedling]] establishment. Other effects
include increases in [[salinity]] tolerance,&lt;ref&gt;Hirrel, M.C. and Gerdemann, J.W., 1980. Improved Growth of Onion and Bell Pepper in Saline Soils by Two Vesicular-Arbuscular Mycorrhizal Fungi 1. Soil Science Society of America Journal, 44(3), pp.654-655.&lt;/ref&gt; drought tolerance,&lt;ref&gt;Ferrazzano, S. and Williamson, P. (2013). Benefits of mycorrhizal inoculation in reintroduction of endangered plant species under drought conditions. Journal of Arid Environments, 98, pp.123-125.&lt;/ref&gt; and resistance to trace metal toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;
Firmin, S., Labidi, S., Fontaine, J., Laruelle, F., Tisserant, B., Nsanganwimana, F., Pourrut, B., Dalpé, Y., Grandmougin, A., Douay, F., Shirali, P., Verdin, A. and Lounès-Hadj Sahraoui, A. (2015). Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal inoculation protects Miscanthus×giganteus against trace element toxicity in a highly metal-contaminated site. Science of the Total Environment, 527-528, pp.91-99.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inoculant usage===

Fungal inoculants can be used with or without additional amendments in private gardens, homesteads, agricultural production, native nurseries, and land restoration projects.

==Composite inoculants==
The combination of strains of Plant Growth Promoting Rhizobacteria has been shown to benefit rice (''Oryza'', Nguyen ''et al.'' (2002)) and barley.&lt;ref&gt;Belimov, A. A., Kojemiakov, A. P. &amp; Chuvarliyeva, C. V. (1995a) Interaction between barley and mixed cultures of nitrogen fixing and phosphate-solubilising bacteria. Plant and Soil, 173, 29-37.&lt;/ref&gt; The main benefit from dual inoculants is increased plant nutrient uptake, from both soil and fertiliser (Bashan ''et al.'', 2004; Belimov ''et al.'' 1995a). Multiple strain inoculants have also been demonstrated to increase total nitrogenase activity compared to single strain inoculants, even when only one strain is diazotrophic (Lippi ''et al.'', 1992; Khammas &amp; Kaiser, 1992, Belimov ''et al.'' 1995a).

PGPR and arbuscular mycorrhizae in combination can be useful in increasing wheat growth in nutrient poor soil&lt;ref&gt;Singh, S. &amp; Kapoor, K. K. (1999) Inoculation with phosphate-solubilising microorganisms and a vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus improves dry matter yield and nutrient uptake by wheat grown in sandy soil. Biology and Fertility of Soils, 28, 139-144.&lt;/ref&gt; and improving nitrogen-extraction from fertilised soils.&lt;ref&gt;Galal, Y. G. M., El-Ghandour, I. A., Osman, M. E. &amp; Abdel Raouf, A. M. N. (2003), The effect of inoculation by mycorrhizae and rhizobium on the growth and yield of wheat in relation to nitrogen and phosphorus fertilization as assessed by 15n techniques, Symbiosis, 34(2), 171-183.&lt;/ref&gt; In salinised soils, Rabie (2005) found that inoculating AM-infected ''Vicia faba'' plants with ''Azospirillum brasilense'' amplified the beneficial effects of AM inoculation.

'''Museology''' or '''museum studies''' is the study of [[museum]]s. It explores the history of museums and their role in society, as well as the activities they engage in, including [[Curator|curating]], [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|preservation]], public programming, and [[Museum education|education]].

== Terminology ==
The words that are used to describe the study of museums vary depending on language and geography. For example, while “museology” is becoming more prevalent in English, it is most commonly used to refer to the study of museums in French (muséologie), Spanish (museología), German (Museologie), Italian (museologia), and Portuguese (museologia) – while English speakers more often use the term “museum studies” to refer to that same field of study. When referring to the day-to-day operations of museums, other European languages typically use derivatives of the [[Latin]] “museographia” (French: muséographie, Spanish: museografía, German: Museographie, Italian: museografia, Portuguese: museografia), while English speakers typically use the term “museum practice” or “operational museology”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|title=Key Concepts of Museology|last=International Council of Museums|first=|date=2009|website=icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf/Key_Concepts_of_Museology/Museologie_Anglais_BD.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the field ==
The development of museology in Europe coincided with the emergence of early [[Collecting#History|collectors]] and [[Cabinet of curiosities|cabinets of curiosity]] in the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. In particular, during [[Age of Enlightenment|The Age of Enlightenment]] anthropologists, naturalists, and hobbyist collectors encouraged the growth of public museums that displayed [[Natural history museum|natural history]]  and ethnographic objects and art in North America and Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, European powers’ [[colonization]] of overseas lands was accompanied by the development of the disciplines of natural history and ethnography, and the rise of private and institutional collection building. In many cases museums became the holding places for collections that were acquired through colonial conquests, which positioned museums as key institutions in [[Western Europe]]an [[Western European colonialism and colonization|colonial projects]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ecomuseums: A Sense of Place|last=Davis|first=Peter|publisher=Continuum International Publishing: London.|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, European museology was focused on framing museums as institutions that would educate and “civilize” the general public. Museums typically served nationalist interests, and their primary purpose was often to celebrate the state, country, or colonial power. Though [[World's fair|World’s Fairs]], such as [[The Great Exhibition|The Great Exhibition of 1851]] in London or the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World’s Fair]], were temporary, they were some of the first examples of large-scale exhibition spaces dedicated to nationalist agendas; both Britain and America wanted to assert themselves as international leaders in science and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Civilization in the West|last=Kishlansky|first=M.|last2=Geary|first2=P.|last3=O’Brien|first3=P.|publisher=Pearson Education.|year=2008|isbn=|edition=7|volume=C|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases world's fairs became the basis for museums. For instance, The Field Museum in Chicago grew out of the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/about/history|website=The Field Museum|accessdate=6 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Museums Association]], the first professional membership organization for those working in the museum field, was established in London in 1889. In 1901, they developed [[Museums Journal]], the first publication devoted entirely to the theory and practice of museums, and soon after other magazines appeared, like Museumskunde in Germany (1905) and the [[American Alliance of Museums|American Association of Museum’s]] Museum Work in the United States (1919). With the creation of the [[International Council of Museums]] (ICOM) in 1946, the study of museums gained increasing momentum and exposure, though at the time most of the scholarly focus was on operational museology, or museum practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=For Instruction and Recreation: A Centenary History of the Museums Association|last=Lewis|first=G.|publisher=Quiller Press.|year=1989|isbn=1-870948-37-8|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto.|last=Shelton|first=A.|publisher=Museum Worlds|year=2013|isbn=|volume=5 |issue=1|location=|pages=8.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in the 1950s, new forms of museology were emerging as a way to revitalize the educational role of museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Van Mensch|first=Peter|date=1995|title=Magpies on Mount Helicon. Museum and Community|url=|journal=ICOFOM Study Series|volume=25|pages=133–138|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One attempt to re-envision museums’ role was the concept of [[Ecomuseum]]s, first proposed publicly at ICOM’s 9th International Conference in France (1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Panamanian Museums and Historical Memory.|last=Sánchez Laws|first=Ana Luisa|publisher=Berghahn Books.|year=2011|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ecomuseum]]s proliferated in Europe – and still exist around the world today – challenging traditional museums and dominant museum narratives, with an explicit focus on community control and the development of both heritage and sustainability. In 1988, Robert Lumley’s book The Museum Time Machine “expressed the growing disquiet about traditional museological presuppositions and operations”.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The following year, Peter Vergo published his critically acclaimed edited collection The New Museology (1989/1997), a work that aimed to challenge the traditional or “old” field of museology, and was named one of the Paperbacks of the Year by [[The Sunday Times]] in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Museology|last=Vergo|first=Peter|publisher=University of Chicago Press Books|year=1989|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Ivan Karp co-organized two ground-breaking conferences at the Smithsonian, Exhibiting Cultures (1988) and Museums and Communities (1990), that soon resulted in highly influential volumes of the same names that redefined museums studies.&lt;ref name=ExhibitingCultures&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Lavine|first2=Steven D.|title=Exhibiting Cultures: The Poetics and Politics of Museum Display|date=1991|publisher=Smithsonian Press|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Karp|first1=Ivan|last2=Kreamer|first2=Christine Mullen|last3=Lavine|first3=Steven|title=Museums and Communities: The Politics of Public Culture|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars who are engaged in various “new” museological practices sometimes disagree about when this trend “officially” began, what exactly it encompasses, and whether or not it is an ongoing field of study. However, the common thread of New Museology is that it has always involved some form of “radical reassessment of the roles of museums within society”.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Critical theorists like [[Michel Foucault]], [[Walter Benjamin]], and [[Benedict Anderson]] also had a profound influence on late 20th and early 21st century museology. As other disciplines began to be critically reassessed – often adding the term “critical” to their new titles (i.e. [[critical race theory]]) – a discourse of critical museology also emerged, intensifying around the turn of the 21st century. It arose from a similar critical discourse as New Museology and shares many of its features – so much so that many scholars disagree about the extent to which you can distinguish one from the other. In other words, while some scholars say that New Museology was a watershed moment in the late 20th century and critical museology is a related but separate movement in the early 21st century, others argue that New Museology is an ongoing field of study that has many manifestations and names, one of which is critical museology &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stam|first=D.|date=1983|title=The Informed Muse: The Implications of 'The New Museology' for Museum Practice|url=|journal=Museum Management and Curatorship|volume=12|pages=267–283|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The latest movements in museology tend to focus on museums being [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]], multi-vocal, accessible, and open to criticism. While these critical discourses dominate contemporary museology, there are many different kinds of museums that exist today, some of which are engaged in new and innovative practices, and others that are more traditional and less critical.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Operational museology ==
Operational museology refers to the day-to-day operations of a museum, including its organizational and regulatory structures, institutional policies and protocols (procedural, ethical, etc.), collections management (including [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation and restoration]]), and its [[Exhibit design|exhibitions]] and programs.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While there has been much scholarship around operational museology over the last 30 years, some scholars argue that it has lacked sustained analysis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Critical museology==

=== Overview of the field ===
Critical museology has emerged as a key discourse in contemporary museology. It is a broad field of study that engages critically with museums, calling into question the foundation assumptions of the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shelton|first1=Anthony|title=Critical Museology: A Manifesto|journal=Museum Worlds|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|pages=7–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Curatorial Dreams: Critics Imagine Exhibition|last=Lehrer|first=Erica|last2=Butler|first2=Shelley Ruth|publisher=McGill-Queen’s University Press|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This demonstrates critical museology’s close connection to New Museology, which also challenges foundational assumptions in museology. Critical museology may also extend beyond the traditional [[museum]] to include [[Cultural center|cultural centres]], [[Historic site|heritage sites]], [[memorial]]s, [[Art museum|art galleries]], and so on.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Birth of the Museum: History, Theory, Politics|last=Bennett|first=Tony|publisher=Routledge|year=1995|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ExhibitingCultures /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hybrid Cultures: Strategies for Entering and Leaving Modernity|last=Canclini|first=Nestor Garcia|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|year=1995|isbn=|location=Minneapolis|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development of the field ===
Given that museums are historically linked to [[colonialism]], [[imperialism]], and European [[missionary]] work, they have a morally and politically problematic past. While some of the objects museums hold were purchased – though not always fairly and often to the exclusive benefit of the collector – a large proportion of museum collections were taken as spoils of war, or otherwise removed without the consent of the people or community that owned them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Greenblatt|first=Steven|date=1991|title=Resonance and Wonder|url=|journal=Exhibiting Cultures: Poetics and Politics of Museum Display|volume=|pages=44|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museums, along with their collections – and collectors – played a key role in establishing and reiterating the dominance of colonial Europe and narratives of cultural superiority. Critical museology was developed through questioning the foundational assumptions of museum studies and museums, including their history, architecture, display, programming, and the provenance of their objects.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duncan|first=Carol|date=|title=Art Museums and the Ritual of Citizenship|url=|journal=Exhibiting Cultures. Smithsonian Institution|volume=|pages=88–103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has also analyzed exhibition design to show how the diverse media combined in exhibitions communicate and shape visitors' interpretations and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kratz|first1=Corinne A.|title=The Ones That Are Wanted: Communication and the Politics of Representation in a Photographic Exhibition|date=2002|publisher=University of California|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kratz|first1=Corinne|title=Rhetorics of Value: Constituting Worth and Meaning through Cultural Display|journal=Visual Anthropology|date=2011|volume=27|issue=1|pages=21–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[anthropologist]]s and the field of [[anthropology]] were actively engaged in problematic collecting practices for two centuries, anthropologists have also been central to the emergence of critical museology in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lorente|first=J.

=== Decolonizing and indigenizing museums ===
In North America, Australia, and New Zealand in particular, critical museology attempts to address the problematic colonial pasts of museums through the decolonization and Indigenization of museums.

Once viewed as the formal process of handing over the instruments of government, decolonizing is now recognized – particularly in Canada – as a long-term process that involves dismantling the bureaucratic, cultural, linguistic, and psychological legacies of colonial power &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Huygens|first=Ingrid|date=2011|title=Developing a Decolonisation Practice for Settler Colonisers: A Case Study from Aotearoa New Zealand|url=|journal=Settler Colonial Studies|volume=1 |issue=2|pages=53–81|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Honouring_the_Truth_Reconciling_for_the_Future_July_23_2015.pdf|title=Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Final Report – Executive Summary|last=|first=|date=2015|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no agreed upon end-goal of decolonization, the process of decolonizing the museum is aimed at “assist[ing] communities in their efforts to address the legacies of historical unresolved grief by speaking the hard truths of colonialism and thereby creating spaces for healing and understanding”.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Collaboration, consultation, and [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriation]] are key components of decolonizing museums. Australian museums have been leaders in developing repatriation processes, consultation, and collaboration with Indigenous communities, beginning in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Des|last2=Paroissien, eds.|first2=Leon|title=Understanding Museums:  Australian museums and museology|url=http://nma.gov.au/research/understanding-museums/_lib/pdf/Understanding-Museums_Indigenous_people_and_museums.pdf|website=National Museum Australia|publisher=National Museum Australia|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Projects involving collaboration and consultation with source communities have taken many forms, ranging from developing traveling exhibits, revising collection catalogues, to establishing community cultural centers and working with photographic collections together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Luo Visual History Project|url=http://web.prm.ox.ac.uk/Luo/luo/page/home/|website=Pitt Rivers Museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverman, ed.|first1=Raymond|title=Museum as Process: Translating Local and Global Knowledges|date=2015|publisher=Routledge|location=NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, collaboration and consultation were first formally suggested by the 1994 Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples, and are now seen by many museums as being an essential practice for any institution that holds collections belonging to [[Indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museums.in1touch.org/uploaded/web/docs/Task_Force_Report_1994.pdf|title=Task Force Report on Museums and First People|last=Assembly of First Nations &amp; Canadian Museums Association|first=|date=1994|website=museums.in1touch.org/uploaded/web/docs/Task_Force_Report_1994.pdf|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, and around the world, some of the objects in those collections – particularly sacred objects or human remains – have been [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriated]] or returned to their communities of origin. [[Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act|The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990)]] formalized the process of [[Repatriation (cultural heritage)|repatriating]] Indigenous cultural objects in the United States. While Canada does not have a formal policy around repatriation, many museums have their own internal policies and many objects have been returned to Indigenous communities that way. Though repatriation policies are typically well intended, the process has often been complicated by institutional, community, and government politics, and have had varying degrees of success.

A newer concept, the I[[Indigenization|ndigenization]] of museums, moves away from focusing exclusively on collaborative methods and towards employing Indigenous people to work in positions of power within museums as a means of opening up the museum to sustained Indigenous influences, and restructuring the museum to reflect Indigenous approaches to knowledge sharing. Examples of indigenizing museum practice include [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]'s 2016 appointing of [[Wanda Nanibush]] as the Curator of Canadian and Indigenous Art,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/visualarts/2016/07/22/wanda-nanibush-named-agos-first-curator-of-indigenous-art.html|title=Wanda Nanibush Named AGO’s First Curator of Indigenous Art|last=Whyte|first=Murray|date=2016|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood Land School’s takeover of the SBC Gallery of Contemporary Art in Montreal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/2b2fa6_8f2b4b9eece24189920c7ab3031744f0.pdf|title=Inside a Year-Long Experiment in Indigenous Institutional Critique.|last=Hampton|first=John|date=2017|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the appointment of Aboriginal curators at the South Australia Museum, the Australian Museum, the National Museum of Australia, and the Museum of Contemporary Art Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Daley|first1=Paul|title=An Indigenous curator for Indigenous artefacts: South Australia breaks new ground|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/postcolonial-blog/2016/sep/03/an-indigenous-curator-for-indigenous-artefacts-south-australia-breaks-new-ground|accessdate=16 January 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Djon Mundine|url=https://www.boomerangfestival.com.au/schedule/detail.aspx?ArtistID=113|website=Boomerang Festival|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laura McBride|url=https://australianmuseum.net.au/staff/laura-mcbride|website=Australian Museum|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TWO FIRST NATIONS CURATORS FROM MCA AUSTRALIA CHOSEN FOR VENICE BIENNALE|url=https://www.mca.com.au/press/2017/05/04/two-first-nations-curators-mca-australia-chosen-venice-biennale/|website=Museum of Contemporary Art Australia|accessdate=16 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the creation of the Reciprocal Research Network, which is an interactive online resource co-developed by the [[Musqueam Indian Band]], the [[Sto:lo Nation|Sto:lo Nation Tribal Council]], the U’mista Cultural Centre, and the [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]] at [[University of British Columbia|UBC]], to facilitate collaborative research and knowledge exchange between communities, scholars, and cultural institutions in Canada and internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rrncommunity.org/pages/about|title=Reciprocal Research Network|last=|first=|date=2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While there is no linear trajectory of decolonizing/Indigenizing work in museums, major milestones in Canada include the [[Indians of Canada Pavilion]] at [[Expo 67]]’; The [[Lubicon Lake Indian Nation|Lubicon Cree]]’s boycott of [[Colonialism and the Olympic Games#Claims of cultural theft and erasure at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary.2C AB|The Spirit Sings]], a [[Shell Oil Company|Shell]] sponsored exhibition at the [[Glenbow Museum]] [[Glenbow Museum|i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n 1[[Glenbow Museum|9]]8[[Glenbow Museum|8]], and the resulting Task Force Report on Museums and First Peoples in 1994;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; and [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada]]’[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|s]] [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|2]]0[[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (Canada)|1]]5 final report, with Calls to Action that specifically address museums and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|date=2012|title="No History of Colonialism": Decolonizing Practices in Indigenous Arts|url=|journal=Decolonize Me|publisher=ABC Art Books Canada.|volume=|pages=19–27|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Decolonizing Museology (Lecture)|last=Igloliorte|first=Heather|publisher=|year=2017|isbn=|location=International Field School in Critical Museology Lecture, Concordia University.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alsford|first=Stephen|last2=MacDonald|first2=George|date=1995|title=Canadian Museums and the Representation of Culture in a Multicultural Nation|url=|journal=Cultural Dynamics|volume=7 |issue=1|pages=15–36|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

== New methodologies ==

=== Museum interventions ===
Interventions in museums were [[Art intervention|first employed by artists]] like [[Marcel Duchamp]], who were looking to challenge both established elite art traditions and the expectations of museum visitors. By the late 20th century, interventions had become a methodology used not only by artists, but also by other groups – including activists, museum visitors, and even museums themselves – as a way to democratize exhibitions, challenge dominant narratives, problematize the provenance of museum objects, and so on.

==== Artist interventions ====
A central aspect of [[Institutional Critique]], some artist’s interventions have been co-organized or commissioned by museums themselves – like [[Fred Wilson (artist)|Fred Wilson]]’s Mining the Museum (1992) at the [[Maryland Historical Society]], [[Michael Nicoll Yahgulanaas|Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas]]’ Meddling in the Museum (2007) at UBC’s [[Museum of Anthropology at UBC|Museum of Anthropology]], or the Artists' Interventions at the Pitt Rivers Museum in Oxford&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists' Interventions|url=https://www.prm.ox.ac.uk/artists|website=Pitt Rivers museum|accessdate=28 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; – while others have been done without explicit permission, like [[Andrea Fraser]]’s Museum Highlights (1989) at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wilson|first=Fred|last2=Halle|first2=Howard|date=1993|title=Mining the Museum|jstor=25007622|journal=Grand Street|issue=44|pages=151–172|doi=10.2307/25007622}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bmoreart.com/2017/05/how-mining-the-museum-changed-the-art-world.html|title=How Mining the Museum Changed the Art World – BmoreArt  {{!}}  Baltimore Contemporary Art|website=www.bmoreart.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fred Wilson: Objects and Installations 1979-2000.|last=Berger|first=Maurice|publisher=|year=2001|isbn=|location=Baltimore, Maryland: Center for Art and Visual Culture.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levell|first=N.|date=2013|title=Site-Specificity and Dislocation: Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas and His Haida Manga Meddling|url=|journal=Journal of Material Culture|volume=18 |issue=2|pages=93–116.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/kbunn/Manga.pdf|title=Michael Nicholl Yahgulanaas: Meddling in the Museum.|last=UBC MOA|first=|date=2007|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Richard|date=2014|title=Andrea Fraser – Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk (1989)|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/fraser-museum-highlights-a-gallery-talk-t13715|journal=Tate: Art &amp; Artists.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2010/3/30/fraser-art-institutional/|title=Spotlight: Andrea Fraser {{!}} Arts {{!}} The Harvard Crimson|website=www.thecrimson.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best known artist interventions in a museum is [[James Luna]]’s ''Artifact Piece'', which was first performed at the San Diego Museum of Man in 1987, and then again at ''The Decade Show'' in New York in 1990. Luna, a [[Luiseño]] artist, lay almost naked in a display case filled with artifacts in order to challenge representations of Indigenous peoples in museums and the narratives that accompanied those representations, which suggested that Indigenous people and cultures were dead. The objects in the case included Luna's favorite books and music, his divorce papers, his university degree, photos, and other mementos, alongside labels describing the scars on his body and how he had acquired them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/james-luna-30545878/|title=James Luna. Smithsonian Magazine.|last=K. R.|first=Fletcher|date=2008|work=|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was critically acclaimed for its challenge of conventional narratives of Indigeneity and Indigenous experience. A few years later, two artists – Guillermo Gómez-Peña and Coco Fusco – developed a traveling performance art piece called [[Couple in The Cage: Two Undiscovered Amerindians Visit the West|The ''Couple in the Cage: Two Amerindiens Visit the West'']] that reflected on the treatment and representation of Indigenous peoples in colonial contexts, and was performed in many different spaces, including [[Covent Gardens]], the [[Walker Art Center]], the Smithsonian's [[National Museum of Natural History]], the [[Australian Museum|Australia Museum]], and the [[Field Museum of Natural History|Field Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannheim|first=Bruce|last2=Behar|first2=Ruth|date=1995|title=In Dialogue: The Couple in the Cage: A Guatinaui Odessy|url=|journal=Visual Anthropology Review|volume=11 |issue=1|pages=118–127|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Activist interventions ====
While there is overlap between artist and activist interventions, specific activist groups such as the [[Guerrilla Girls]] have long been creating exhibitions and public advertisements – through the use of billboards, stickers, posters, and projections – to critique power dynamics related to sexism, racism, and class privilege in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guerrillagirls.com|title=Guerrilla Girls|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a tradition of activist interventions being used as responses to the censorship of exhibited artworks. In 1989, after the [[Corcoran Gallery of Art]] cancelled [[Corcoran Gallery of Art#Mapplethorpe scandal|''The Perfect Moment'']], an exhibition of Robert Mapplethorpe’s explicit photography, protesters projected Mapplethorpe’s photos on the exterior of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/01/arts/crowd-at-corcoran-protests-mapplethorpe-cancellation.html|title=Crowd at Corcoran Protests Mapplethorpe Cancellation|last=Gamarekian|first=Barbara|date=1989-07-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-14|last2=Times|first2=Special to The New York|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar protests occurred when [[David Wojnarowicz]]’s film [[David Wojnarowicz#.22A Fire in My Belly.22 controversy|''A Fire in My Belly'']] was removed from the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)#Hide.2FSeek controversy|''Hide/Seek: Difference and Desire in American Portraiture'']] exhibit at the [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/09/AR2010120905895.html|title='Fire' man: Wojnarowicz, censored by Smithsonian, sounded an alarm in dire times|last=Kennicott|first=Philip|date=2010-12-10|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Museum hack ====
Museum interventions have also become increasingly popular through companies such as Museum Hack, which offers unconventional tours of large museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] or the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. These tours depart from traditional methods of museum interpretation by using humor and technology to appeal to younger generations or non-typical museum audiences. Museum Hack functions with permission from the institutions in which they work, rather than providing unsolicited tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://museumhack.com/|title=Museum Hack - Team Building Activities &amp; Museum Tours|website=Museum Hack|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Internal institutional interventions ====

While most interventions are directed at museums from outside sources, museums also engage interventions as a way of performing self-critique. For example, in 2015 [[Museum of Modern Art|MoMA]] mounted a meta-intervention exhibit called ''Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art 1939 – Now''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://post.at.moma.org/content_items/804-messing-with-moma-critical-interventions-at-the-museum-of-modern-art-1939-now|title=Messing with MoMA: Critical Interventions at the Museum of Modern Art, 1939–Now|last=Tobias|first=Jennifer|date=May 26, 2016|website=post.at.moma.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.moma.org/interactives/exhibitions/2015/messingwithmoma/|title=Moma.org {{!}} Interactives {{!}} Exhibitions {{!}} Messing With MoMA|website=www.moma.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar way, ethnographic exhibitions have been incorporating contemporary art as a way to disrupt conventional expectations and narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geismar|first1=Haidy|title=he Art of Anthropology: Questioning Contemporary Art in Ethnographic Display|journal=The International Handbooks of Museum Studies|date=2015|volume=2|issue=10|pages=183–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Curatorial dreaming ===
Curatorial Dreaming was originally developed as a challenge to museum critics, who are typically not expected to provide practical solutions to the issues they identify in the exhibits they critique, to develop their own imagined exhibitions. It is intended as “an alternative mode of critical, intellectual practice – a form of ‘theorizing in the concrete’”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Curating workshops, courses and labs ===
{{external links|section|date=January 2018}}
Over the last three decades there has been a proliferation of curating workshops, courses, and labs that engage with New Museology and critical museology in museum spaces, in universities, and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Radar|url=http://artradarjournal.com/2014/08/22/14-curatorial-training-programmes-in-north-america/|website=14 Curatorial Training Programmes|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, the [http://www.bard.edu/ccs/visit/about-ccs-bard/mission/ Bard Center for Curatorial Studies] in New York was founded in 1990 and began offering a graduate program in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About CSS|url=http://www.bard.edu/ccs/visit/about-ccs-bard/mission/|website=CSS Bard|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the [http://www.carmah.berlin/ Centre for Anthropological Research on Museums and Heritage] is engaging with the social, cultural, and political issues facing contemporary museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carmah.berlin/our-centre/|title=CARMAH – Our Centre|website=www.carmah.berlin|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, two of the most innovative curating labs are the [http://hennessy.iat.sfu.ca/mcl/ Making Culture Lab] at [[Simon Fraser University]] in Vancouver and the [http://capsl.cerev.ca/ Curating and Public Scholarship Lab] at [[Concordia University]] in Montreal, which offered its inaugural [https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/academics/summer/critical-museology.html International Field School in Critical Museology] in May 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hennessy.iat.sfu.ca/mcl/|title=Making Culture Lab|website=hennessy.iat.sfu.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://capsl.cerev.ca/|title=Curating and Public Scholarship Lab|website=Curating and Public Scholarship Lab|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.concordia.ca/artsci/academics/summer/critical-museology.html|title=Curatorial Dreams|website=www.concordia.ca|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [https://www.uwc.ac.za/Faculties/ART/History/Pages/APMHS.aspx African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies] in Cape Town includes a curatorial module within a comprehensive diploma and M.A. program that engages critically with museum and heritage studies, the leading program on the continent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=African Programme in Museum and Heritage Studies|url=https://www.uwc.ac.za/Faculties/ART/History/Pages/APMHS.aspx|website=UWC APMHS|accessdate=7 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Nanotough logo.JPG|thumb|alt=The logo of the project.|Nanotough.]]
'''Nanotough''' is a European framework project that focuses on developing tough plastic materials using nanotechnology. A total of 11 partners from [[Germany]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Romania]] and [[Denmark]] are participating in the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/ Nanotough.aau.dk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nanotough objectives==
The objective of Nanotough is to obtain a deeper understanding of the interfacial structure of nanocomposites within a [[polyolefin]] matrix and thus use [[nanoparticles]] like nanoclay to turn upside down the construction of a number of well-known products, where today metals or plastics are used in for example cars or aircraft. The project will enable realization of the great performance potential of these materials through development of novel multiphase and hybrid nanocomposites.

The project aims to improve the stiffness of polyolefin nanocomposites while not only maintaining but also improving the toughness of the matrix considerably. The technical objective is to optimize and, through novel [[interface design]], to develop new cost effective hybrid (nanofiller-fibre) nanocomposites as an alternative to heavily filled [[polymers]] and expensive engineering polymers and fulfill industry requirements for high performance materials in high tech applications.
Nanocomposites are emerging new materials that promise improved properties, but in practice, it has been difficult to translate existing knowledge on nanotechnology into tangible products. Nanotough’s objective is, in addition to basic research, to remove the technical barriers so that nano-composite-materials can be used commercially and lead to development of new products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/about_nanotough/ About Nanotough at Nanotough.aau.dk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321182036/http://www.nanotough.aau.dk/about_nanotough/ |date=2012-03-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Necrophilia''', also known as '''necrophilism''', '''necrolagnia''', '''necrocoitus''', '''necrochlesis''', and '''thanatophilia''',{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=1}} is a [[sexual attraction]] or sexual act involving [[Cadaver|corpses]]. It is classified as a [[paraphilia]] by [[ICD10]] published by [[WHO]] and the ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual]]'' (DSM) of the [[American Psychiatric Association]].&lt;ref name="goodwin"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Robin|editor1-last=Goodwin|editor2-first=Duncan|editor2-last=Cramer|title=Inappropriate Relationships: The Unconventional, the Disapproved, and the Forbidden|pages=174–176|publisher=Psychology Press|location=London, England|date=2002|ISBN= 978-0805837421}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed information from 34 cases of necrophilia describing the individuals' motivations for their behaviors: these individuals reported the desire to possess a non-resisting and non-rejecting partner (68%), reunions with a romantic partner (21%), sexual attraction to corpses (15%), comfort or overcoming feelings of isolation (15%), or seeking self-esteem by expressing power over a homicide victim (12%).&lt;ref name="rosman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rosman | first1 = J.

==Origins of term==
The term 'necrophilia' is thought to have been coined by Belgian physician [[Joseph Guislain]] in his ''Leçons Orales sur les Phrénopathies'', in a lecture given around 1850, in reference to contemporary necrophile [[François Bertrand]]:&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal p.4&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{quote|It is within the category of the destructive madmen [''aliénés destructeurs''] that one needs to situate certain patients to whom I would like to give the name of necrophiliacs [''nécrophiles'']. The alienists have adopted, as a new form, the case of Sergeant Bertrand, the disinterrer of cadavers on whom all the newspapers have recently reported. However, don't think that we are dealing here with a form of phrenopathy which appears for the first time. The ancients, in speaking about [[lycanthropy]], have cited examples to which one can more or less relate the case which has just attracted the public attention so strongly.}}
The term was popularized about a decade later by psychiatrist [[Bénédict Morel]], who also discussed Bertrand.&lt;ref name="goodwin" /&gt;

==History==
In the ancient world, sailors returning corpses to their home country were often accused of necrophilia.{{sfn|Aggrawal|2016|p=2}} Singular accounts of necrophilia in history are sporadic, though written records suggest the practice was present within [[Ancient Egypt]]. [[Herodotus]] writes in [[Histories (Herodotus)|''The Histories'']] that, to discourage intercourse with a corpse, ancient [[Egypt]]ians left deceased beautiful women to decay for "three or four days" before giving them to the [[embalmers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Herodotus (c. 440 BC) |title=The Histories (Book 2) |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2707 |quote=The wives of men of rank when they die are not given at once to be embalmed, nor such women as are very beautiful or of greater regard than others, but on the third or fourth day after their death (and not before) they are delivered to the embalmers. They do so about this matter in order that the embalmers may not abuse their women, for they say that one of them was taken once doing so to the corpse of a woman lately dead, and his fellow-craftsman gave information.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Brill | first1 = Abraham A. | date= 1941 | title = Necrophilia | journal = Journal of Criminal Psychopathology | volume = 2 | issue = 4| pages = 433–443 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="klaf"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Franklin S.|last1=Klaf |first2=William|last2=Brown  |date= 1958 | title = Necrophilia: Brief Review and Case Report | journal = Psychiatric Quarterly | volume = 32 | issue = 4 | pages = 645–652 | quote = Inhibited forms of necrophilia and necrophiliac fantasies may occur more commonly then is generally realized. | doi=10.1007/bf01563024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus also alluded to suggestions that Greek tyrant [[Periander]] had defiled the corpse of his wife, employing a metaphor: "Periander baked his bread in a cold oven."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Anil |last= Aggrawal| date = 2010 | title = Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects | publisher = CRC Press |location=Boca Raton, Florida| ISBN= 978-1420089127|pages = 6–7|quote=The primary source is ''Histories'', Book V, 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acts of necrophilia are depicted on ceramics from the [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture, which reigned in northern [[Peru]] from the first to eighth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steve|last=Finbow | date = 2014 | title = Grave Desire: A Cultural History of Necrophilia | publisher = John Hunt Publishing | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=rGIpBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT4&amp;ots=74OrhG8hA4&amp;pg=PT39}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common theme in these artifacts is the masturbation of a male skeleton by a living woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weismantel, M. | year = 2004 | title = Moche sex pots: Reproduction and temporality in ancient South America | journal = American Anthropologist | volume = 106 | issue = 3 | pages = 495–496 | url = http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/moche/moche-sex-pots.pdf | doi=10.1525/aa.2004.106.3.495}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hittites|Hittite]] law from the 16th century BC through to the 13th century BC explicitly permitted sex with the dead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Boer, Roland | year = 2014 | title = Sex in Antiquity: Exploring Gender and Sexuality in the Ancient World | chapter = From Horse Kissing to Beastly Emissions: Paraphilias in the Ancient Near East | editor = Masterson, Mark | publisher = Routledge | page = 69 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=k1G2BQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;ots=DtUbHRO19Dlr&amp;pg=PA69#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt; In what is now [[Northeast China]], the ethnic [[Xianbei]] emperor [[Murong Xi]] (385–407) of the [[Later Yan]] state had intercourse with the corpse of his beloved empress [[Fu Xunying]], after the latter was already cold and put into the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tales about Chinese Emperors: Their Wild and Wise Ways|chapter=The Corpse-Raping Emperor|last=Luan Pao-chün|year=1994|pages=148–?|isbn=|publisher=Hai Feng Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Renaissance Italy]], following the reputed moral collapse brought about by the [[Black Death]] and before the [[Roman Inquisition]] of the [[Counter-Reformation]], the literature was replete with sexual references; these include necrophilia, in the case of the epic poem ''[[Orlando Innamorato]]'' by [[Matteo Maria Boiardo]], first published in 1483.&lt;ref name="DavidsonDean1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Davidson|first1=Nicholas|last2=Dean|first2=Trevor|last3=Lowe|first3=K.

Dahmer wanted to create a [[sex slave]] that would mindlessly consent to whatever he wanted. When his attempts failed, and his male victim died, he would keep the corpse until it decomposed beyond recognition, continuously masturbating and performing sexual intercourse on the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.comicextra.com/my-friend-dahmer/chapter-Full/214|title=My Friend Dahmer #Full - Read My Friend Dahmer Issue #Full Page 214|website=www.comicextra.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to be aroused, he had to murder his male victims before performing sexual intercourse with them.
Dahmer stated that he only killed his victims because they wanted to leave after having sex, and would be angry with him for drugging them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychiatric Testimony of Jeffrey Dahmer|url=http://www.criminalprofiling.com/Psychiatric-Testimony-of-Jeffrey-Dahmer_s115.html|work=Court Transcripts|publisher=Criminal Profiling|date=8 June 2001|accessdate=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; British serial killer [[Dennis Nilsen]] is also considered to have been a necrophiliac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Masters, Brian | year = 1985 | title = Killing For Company | publisher = Arrow | isbn = 978-0099552611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
In the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], fifth edition ([[DSM-5]]), recurrent, intense sexual interest in corpses can be diagnosed under [[Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder]] (necrophilia) when it causes marked distress or impairment in important areas of functioning.&lt;ref name="DSM-5"&gt;{{cite book | title = Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition | chapter = Other Specified Paraphilic Disorder, 302.89 (F65.89) | editor = American Psychiatric Association | year = 2013 | publisher = American Psychiatric Publishing | page = 705}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ten-tier classification of necrophilia exists:&lt;ref name="aggrawal_classification"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aggrawal, Anil |title=A new classification of necrophilia |journal=Journal of Forensic and Legal Medicine |volume=16 |issue=6 |pages=316–20 |year=2009 |pmid=19573840 |doi=10.1016/j.jflm.2008.12.023 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1752928X08002564}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Tactile necrophiliacs: People who are aroused by touching or stroking a corpse, without engaging in intercourse.
# [[Sexual fetishism|Fetishistic]] necrophiliacs: People who remove objects (e.g., panties or a tampon) or body parts (e.g., a finger or genitalia) from a corpse for sexual purposes, without engaging in intercourse.
# Necromutilomaniacs: People who derive pleasure from mutilating a corpse while masturbating, without engaging in intercourse.
# Opportunistic necrophiliacs: People who normally have no interest in necrophilia, but take the opportunity when it arises.
# Regular necrophiliacs: People who preferentially have intercourse with the dead.
# Homicidal necrophiliacs: Necrosadists,{{sfn|Purcell|2006|p=21}} people who commit [[lust murder|murder]] in order to have sex with the victim.
# Exclusive necrophiliacs: People who have an exclusive interest in sex with the dead, and cannot perform at all for a living partner.
Additionally, criminologist [[Lee Mellor]]'s typology of homicidal necrophiles consists of eight categories (A–H), and is based on the combination of two behavioral axes: destructive (offender [[Mutilation|mutilates]] the corpse for sexual reasons) – preservative (offender does not), and cold (offender used the corpse sexually two hours after death) – warm (offender used the corpse sexually earlier than two hours after death).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Homicide: A Forensic Psychology Casebook|last=Mellor|first=Lee|publisher=CRC|year=2016|isbn=|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=103–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; This renders four categories (A-D) to which Mellor adds an additional four (E-H):
* Category A (cold/destructive), e.g. [[Ted Bundy]], [[Jeffrey Dahmer]]
* Category B (cold/preservative), e.g. [[Gary Ridgway]], [[Dennis Nilsen]]
* Category C (warm/destructive) e.g. [[Andrei Chikatilo]], [[Joseph Vacher]]
* Category D (warm/preservative) e.g. [[Robert Lee Yates|Robert Yates]], [[Earle Nelson]]
* Category E (dabblers) e.g. [[Richard Ramirez]], [[Mark Dixie]]
* Category F ([[Fredric Wertham|catathymic]]){{clarify|date=November 2018}}
* Category G (exclusive necromutilophiles) e.g. [[Robert Napper]], [[Peter Sutcliffe]]
* Category H (sexual [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] &amp; vampires) e.g. [[Albert Fish]], [[Peter Kürten]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 
Dabblers have transitory opportunistic sexual relations with corpses, but this is not their preference. Category F homicidal necrophiles commit postmortem sex acts only while in a [[Fredric Wertham|catathymic]] state. Exclusive mutilophiles derive pleasure purely from mutilating the corpse, while sexual [[Human cannibalism|cannibals]] and vampires are sexually aroused by eating human body parts. Category A, C, and F offenders may also cannibalize or drink the blood of their victims.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Research==

===Humans===
Necrophilia is often assumed to be rare, but no data for its prevalence in the general population exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author =  Milner, J. S., Dopke, C. A., &amp; Crouch, J. L.  | date= 2008 | title = Sexual Deviance: Theory, Assessment, and Treatment, 2nd edition | publisher = The Guilford Press | page = 399 | chapter = Paraphilia Not Otherwise Specified: Psychopathology and Theory | editor = Laws, D. Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some necrophiles only fantasize about the act, without carrying it out.&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt; In 1958, Klaf and Brown commented that, although rarely described, necrophiliac [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]] may occur more often than is generally supposed.&lt;ref name="klaf"/&gt;

Rosman and Resnick (1989) reviewed 122 cases of necrophilia. The sample was divided into genuine necrophiles, who had a persistent attraction to corpses, and pseudo-necrophiles, who acted out of opportunity, sadism, or transient interest.  Of the total, 92% were male and 8% were female. 57% of the genuine necrophiles had occupational access to corpses, with morgue attendant, hospital orderly, and cemetery employee being the most common jobs. The researchers theorized that either of the following situations could be antecedents to necrophilia:&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;
#The necrophile develops poor [[self-esteem]], perhaps due in part to a significant loss;
#:(a) They are very fearful of rejection by others and they desire a sexual partner who is incapable of rejecting them; and/or
#:(b) They are fearful of the dead, and transform their fear—by means of [[reaction formation]]—into a desire.
#They develop an exciting fantasy of sex with a corpse, sometimes after exposure to a corpse.

The authors reported that, of their sample of genuine necrophiles:&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;
*68% were motivated by a desire for an unresisting and unrejecting partner;
*21% by a want for reunion with a lost partner;
*15% by sexual attraction to dead people;
*15% by a desire for comfort or to overcome feelings of isolation; and
*12% by a desire to remedy low self-esteem by expressing power over a corpse.

IQ data was limited, but not abnormally low. About half of the sample had a personality disorder, and 11% of true necrophiles were psychotic. Rosman and Resnick concluded that their data challenged the conventional view of necrophiles as generally psychotic, mentally deficient, or unable to obtain a consenting partner.&lt;ref name="rosman" /&gt;

[[Kees Moeliker]] made one observation while he was sitting in his office at the [[Natural History Museum Rotterdam]], when he heard the distinctive thud of a bird hitting the glass facade of the building. Upon inspection, he discovered a drake (male) [[mallard]] lying dead outside the building. Next to the downed bird there was a second drake mallard standing close by. As Moeliker observed the couple, the living drake pecked at the corpse of the dead one for a few minutes  then mounted the corpse and began copulating with it. The act of necrophilia lasted for about 75 minutes, in which time, according to Moeliker, the living drake took two short breaks before resuming with copulating behavior. Moeliker surmised that at the time of the collision with the window the two mallards were engaged in a common pattern in [[duck]] behavior called "attempted [[rape]] flight". "When one died the other one just went for it and didn't get any negative feedback &amp;mdash; well, didn't get any feedback," according to Moeliker.&lt;ref name="Mallard Duck"&gt;{{cite journal | author=C.W.

==Legality==
'''Australia'''

Necrophilia is not explicitly mentioned in Australian law, however, under the Crimes Act 1900 - Sect 81C it states misconduct with regard to corpses is any person who:

(a) indecently interferes with any dead human body, or

(b) improperly interferes with, or offers any indignity to, any dead human body or human remains (whether buried or not),

shall be liable to imprisonment for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www6.austlii.edu.au/cgi-bin/viewdoc/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/ca190082/s81c.html|title=CRIMES ACT 1900 - SECT 81C
Misconduct with regard to corpses|website=www6.austlii.edu.au|language=en|access-date=2018-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brazil===

Article 212 of the Brazilian Penal Code (federal Decree-Law No 2.848) states as follows:&lt;ref name=bpc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/decreto-lei/Del2848compilado.htm |title=Código Penal (Decreto-Lei nº 2.848) |publisher=Presidency of the Republic |date=December 7, 1940 |accessdate=2016-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Free translation from Brazilian Portuguese to English.&lt;/ref&gt;
		 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Art. 212 - To abuse a cadaver or its ashes:&lt;br&gt;Penalty: detention, from 1 to 3 years, plus fine.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Although sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted of  a crime under the above Article. The legal asset protected by such Article is not the corpse's objective honor, but the feeling of good memories, respect and veneration that living people keep about the deceased person: these persons are considered passive subjects of the corpse's violation.

===India===
Section 297 of the Indian Penal Code entitled "Trespassing on burial places, etc.", states as follows:&lt;ref name="ipc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mynation.net/ipc.htm#_Toc496765169 |title=The Indian Penal Code (IPC): Dowry Law Misuse (IPC 448) By Indian Women |publisher=Mynation.net |date= |accessdate=2013-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Whoever, with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person, or of insulting the religion of any person, or with the knowledge that the feelings of any person are likely to be wounded, or that the religion of any person is likely to be insulted thereby,
commits any trespass in any place of worship or on any place of sculpture, or any place set apart from the performance of funeral rites or as a depository for the remains of the dead, or offers any indignity to any human corpse, or causes disturbance to any persons assembled for the performance of funeral ceremonies, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to one year, or with fine, or with both.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although sex with a corpse is not explicitly mentioned, a person who has sex with a corpse may be convicted under the above section. [[Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code]] could also be invoked.

===New Zealand===
Under Section 150 of the New Zealand [[Crimes Act 1961]], it is an offence for there to be "misconduct in respect to human remains". Subsection (b) elaborates that this applies if someone "improperly or indecently interferes with or offers indignity to any dead human body or human remains, whether buried or not". This statute is therefore applicable to sex with corpses and carries a potential two-year prison sentence, although there is no case law as yet that would apply the aforementioned statute.&lt;ref&gt;Butterworths Crimes Act 1961: Wellington: Butterworths: 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Section 14 of the [[Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act, 2007]] prohibits the commission of a sexual act with a corpse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf |format=PDF |title=Criminal Law (Sexual Offences and Related Matters) Amendment Act 32 of 2007 |at=sec. 14 |date=December 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523214416/http://www.justice.gov.za/legislation/acts/2007-032.pdf |archivedate=2012-05-23 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until codified by the act it was a [[common law offence]].

===Sweden===
Section 16, § 10 of the Swedish Penal Code criminalizes necrophilia, but it is not explicitly mentioned. Necrophilia falls under the regulations against abusing a corpse or grave (''brott mot griftefrid''), which carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison. One person has been convicted of necrophilia. He was sentenced to psychiatric care for that and other crimes, including arson.&lt;ref name="HD06"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.hd.se/2006-10-06/fakta-nekrofili-och-brott-mot-griftefrid |title=Fakta: Nekrofili och brott mot griftefrid |work=HD |access-date=2017-09-21 |language=sv-SE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom ===
Sexual penetration of a corpse was made illegal under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]], carrying a maximum sentence of two years' imprisonment. Prior to 2003, necrophilia was not illegal; however, exposing a naked corpse in public was classed as a [[public nuisance]] (''R v. Clark [1883] 15 Cox 171'').&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal p.200&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
There is no federal legislation specifically barring sex with a corpse. Multiple states have their own laws:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Aggrawal, Anil | year = 2010 | title = Necrophilia: Forensic and Medico-legal Aspects | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 201–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Posner, Richard A. |author2=Silbaugh, Katharine B. | year = 1996 | title = A Guide to America's Sex Laws | publisher = University of Chicago Press | pages = 213–216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Antiquity is referred to as the
time period before the Middle Ages which began around 500A.D. The major
civilizations are those of the Mediterranean region, [[ancient Greece]], [[ancient Rome]], and southwest Asia. Nutrition consisted of simple fresh whole foods that
were either locally grown or transported from neighboring towns during times of crisis. Physicians and philosophers studied the effect of food on the human
body and they generally agreed that food was important in preventing illness
and restoring health.

==Food of Antiquity== 
People ate various types of food, consumers
had choices from dairy (milk and cheese), fruits (figs, pears, apples, and pomegranates),
vegetables (greens and bulbs), Grains and legumes (cereal, wheat barley, millet,
beans, and chickpeas), and meat (beef, mutton, fowl, muscles, and oysters).&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Skiadas, P., &amp; Lascaratos, J. (2001). Dietetics in ancient Greek philosophy: Plato’s concepts of healthy diet. , Published Online: 14 June 2001; | doi:10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601179, 55(7).&lt;/ref&gt; Food was most often fresh, but the processing
of food aided in the preservation for long term storage or transport to other
cities. Cereals, olives, wine, legumes, vegetables, fruit, and animal products
could all be processed and stored for later use.&lt;ref&gt;Thurmond, D. L. (2006). A handbook of food processing in classical Rome: For her bounty no winter(Technology and change in history, v. 9; Technology and change in history, v. 9). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; Cereals were
often processed and stored in the form of bread, flat-cakes, and porridge.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.15&lt;/ref&gt; Legumes were also most often processed and stored as pulses
and eaten with bread to enhance the flavor.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.15&lt;/ref&gt; Cereals were
most nourishing providing essential macro- and micronutrients to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.36&lt;/ref&gt; Cereals sustained individuals with sufficient amounts of protein,
vitamin B, vitamin E, calcium, and iron.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Fruits and vegetables
provided vitamin A, vitamin C, vitamin D, and half the dietary fiber needed for
health support.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Food Shortage== 
Cities depended on trade with
agricultural farmers and neighboring cities for food supply due to the lack of
land cultivation area.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P., &amp; Scheidel, W. (1998). Cities, peasants, and food in classical antiquity : Essays in social and economic history.Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 29 - 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Food supply was altered by numerous events such as climate, location, and
distribution.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Weather drastically affected the amount of
produce harvested during a growing season. Climate often fluctuated in the Mediterranean
region with varying temperatures and volumes of precipitation; these two
factors also affected the quality of soil available to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 35&lt;/ref&gt;  Soil composition mainly depended on
location, but the climate affected the moisture retained within the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Thurmond, D. L. (2006). A handbook of food processing in classical Rome: For her bounty no winter(Technology and change in history, v. 9; Technology and change in history, v. 9). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; If the growing season was not prosperous then cities would
have to resort to trade as a means for food supply. This often made food
distribution difficult due to political disagreements and issues with
transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 35&lt;/ref&gt; To combat hunger due to inadequate food
supply people would eat twigs, roots of plants, bark from trees, and each other
as a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;Garnsey, P. (1999). Food and society in classical antiquity (Key themes in ancient history; Key themes in ancient history). Cambridge, U.K.: Cambridge University Press. P. 37&lt;/ref&gt; Food shortages were frequent but didn’t
last long enough to generate famine.

[[File:Kapitolinischer Pythagoras adjusted.jpg|thumb|right|Kapitolinischer Pythagoras sculpture]]
[[Pythagoras]] (570 BC – 495 BC) was a Greek philosopher, mathematician, and is also considered to be “the Father of
Ethical Vegetarianism”. He believed that in order to obtain the highest level
of spiritual and physical health it was necessary to follow a lifestyle that
included a vegetarian diet which excluded meats and other flesh foods.&lt;ref&gt;Leitzmann C. (2014). Vegetarian nutrition: past, present, future. The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 100, 496S-502S. doi:10.3945/ajcn.113.071365&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anaxagoras]] (500 BC – 428 BC) was also a Greek philosopher,
he suggested that foods that we ate contained fragments that were needed for
growth in the body. His belief was that “everything is in everything, at all
times”, physical characteristics (hair, nails, flesh, etc.) were generated from
foods that contained those same substances.&lt;ref&gt;Sisko, J. E. (2010). Anaxagoras on Matter, Motion, and Multiple Worlds. Philosophy Compass, 5(6), 443-454. doi:10.1111/j.1747-9991.2010.00313.x&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hippocrates]] (460 BC –
377 BC) was a physician known as the “father of medicine”, his nutritional
advice was based on the presence of the four humors in the body.&lt;ref&gt;Ullah, M. F., &amp; Khan, M. W. (2008). Food as medicine: potential therapeutic tendencies of plant derived polyphenolic compounds. Asian Pac J Cancer Prev,9(2), 187-196.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] (428/427 BC – 348/347 BC) was a Greek philosopher and
mathematician; his idea of a healthy diet consisted of balance and moderation
of cereals, fruits, vegetables, dairy, with a strong emphasis on the moderation
of meat and wine.&lt;ref&gt;Skiadas, P., &amp; Lascaratos, J. (2001). Dietetics in ancient Greek philosophy: Plato’s concepts of healthy diet. , Published Online: 14 June 2001; | doi:10.1038/sj.ejcn.1601179, 55(7).&lt;/ref&gt; His belief is that excess food from
one source would lead to future ailments. [[Galen]] (129 AD – 216 AD) built much of
his work by challenging the writings of others. He was an admirer of
Hippocrates because of the work he had done in the field of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Jouanna, J., Eijk, P. J. v. d., &amp; Allies, N. (2012).Greek medicine from Hippocrates to Galen: Selected papers(Studies in Ancient Medicine; Studies in ancient medicine). Leiden: Brill.&lt;/ref&gt; Galen believed that Hippocrates had stated all that needed to be known
about nutrition, and he would interpret his work by the presentation of his own
knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, &amp; Grant, M. (2000). Galen: on food and diet. (M. Grant, Trans.). London and New York: Routledge. P. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine== 
The [[Humorism|humoral theory]] of medicine was
central to medicine during antiquity and for centuries following. Physicians believed
that the body contained a mixture of bodily fluids, the four humors: black
bile, yellow bile, phlegm, and blood. They assessed a patients’ degree of
health based on the balance of these four bodily fluids. Diet was the first prescribed
treatment of disease followed by drugs, then surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, &amp; Grant, M. (2000). Galen: on food and diet. (M. Grant, Trans.). London and New York: Routledge. P. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Early physicians
studied the different ways foods would affect the humors of the body by
restoring health or causing disease. Utilizing knowledge about how humors were affected
by diet physicians prescribed diets with balance, moderation, and timing in
mind. Galen worked extensively on classifying foods according to how they

{{hatnote|The term ''opposing force'' is occasionally used to refer to a genuine military foe. This article is concerned only with its use in simulated conflict.}}
{{more citations needed|date=November 2009}}
[[File:OPFOR Soldiers.jpg|thumbnail|right|300px|U.S. OPFOR Soldiers at [[Fort Polk]], Louisiana]]
An '''opposing force''' (abbreviated '''OPFOR''' or '''enemy force''') is a [[military unit]] tasked with representing an enemy, usually for training purposes in [[War exercise|war game]] scenarios. The related concept of [[aggressor squadron]] is used by some air forces. The United States maintains the [[Fort Irwin National Training Center]] with the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] serving in the main OPFOR role. Other major units include the [[First United States Army]] which consists of 16 training brigades that often also serve as OPFOR. [[Fort Polk]]'s Joint  Readiness Training Center is another major training site typically reserved for units that are slated to deploy into conflict areas.

At a basic level, a unit might serve as an opposing force for a single scenario, differing from its 'opponents' only in the objectives it is given. However, major armies commonly maintain specialized groups trained to accurately emulate real-life enemies, to provide a more realistic experience for their training opponents. (To avoid the diplomatic ramifications of naming a real nation as a likely enemy, training scenarios often use fictionalized versions with different names but similar military characteristics to the expected real-world foes.)

==Tactics==
Opposing forces can also coincide with [[red team]]ing activities. Once the Analytic Red Team develops adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) it will be the opposing force that makes use of those TTPs in wargames and exercises.

Some dedicated opposing forces may fight using the likely enemy's doctrine, weapons, and equipment. They may wear uniforms which resemble the likely enemy's, or one dissimilar to "friendly forces". Their vehicles may either be those operated by the likely enemy's, or may be modified to look like those. All these measures help to enhance training realism and provide useful lessons on how to fight this particular enemy.

[[Blank ammunition]], [[smoke grenade]]s, and [[artillery]] simulators are often used by both sides in the exercise to provide the [[fog of war]] caused by the noise and smoke of battle.

In addition, a simulation system such as the [[Multiple Integrated Laser Engagement System]] (MILES) may be used. This system is attached to various weapons, and are zeroed to the sights of the weapon. When a blank round is fired, the system sends out a laser beam, which score "kills" or "injuries" on any soldier or vehicle in what would be the path of the weapon's projectile. These laser beams are detected by receivers on harnesses worn by the soldiers, or on the vehicle itself.

Alternatively, [[paintball]] weapons which look like real weapons, or simulation rounds such as [[plastic bullet]]s may be used. Usually, controllers follow the training troops to help score additional kills, such as when a simulated grenade is thrown. They may do so with the MILES system using a controller gun. All these measures help to emphasize the importance of aimed fire, and taking cover. These concepts, while obvious, are often neglected in ordinary one-sided training exercises because the soldier does not suffer the consequences.

==Units==

[[File:OPFOR Training.JPG|thumbnail|OPFOR Training 2012]]
[[File:MT-LB US Marines.jpg|thumb|[[US Marines]] using a former [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[MT-LB]] vehicle for the OPFOR role during an exercise]]
One of the best-known examples of specialist operations is the [[United States]]' OPFOR. During the [[Cold War]], opposing force units employed [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] military doctrine and simulated Soviet equipment; since the fall of the USSR, US opposing force units have become more flexible to represent a wider range of opponents. More recently training has focused on Iraq and Afghanistan.

There are three Major Training Centers that utilize home-based OPFOR units for the [[US Army]]:

*The [[National Training Center]] or ''NTC'' at [[Fort Irwin, California]]—home unit is the [[11th Armored Cavalry Regiment]] (the ''Blackhorse'')
*The [[Fort Polk#JRTC moves to Polk|Joint Readiness Training Center]] or ''JRTC'' at [[Fort Polk, Louisiana]]—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 509th Parachute Infantry Regiment (the ''Geronimos'')
*The [[Joint Multinational Readiness Center]] or ''JMRC'' (formerly known as the Combat Maneuver Training Center or CMTC) at Hohenfels, Germany&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hohenfels.army.mil Army.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;—home unit is the 1st Battalion, 4th Infantry Regiment (Separate) (the ''Warriors'')

[[File:Operation_force_Surrogate_Vehicle.jpg|thumb|An OSV replicating a Soviet BMP at NTC, Fort Irwin, CA]]
The units at NTC and JMRC were used to replicate a Soviet Motorized Rifle regiment or division. At NTC, [[M551 Sheridan]]s were used to replicate Soviet [[T-80]] tanks until 2003.  [[vismod|Visually Modified]] (VISMOD) [[HMMWV]]s are used to replicate [[BRDM-2]]s, VISMOD [[M113 armored personnel carrier#Basic variants|M113A3]]s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle [OSV]) are used to replicate [[BMP-2]] Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV), while VISMOD [[M1 Abrams]] Tanks (known as the Krasnovian Variant Tank [KVT]) and M113A2s (known as the OPFOR Surrogate Vehicle, Tank [OSV-T]) are also used to replicate the [[T-80]]. At JMRC, M113A2s are used to replicate Soviet BMP-2s and [[M60 Patton#M60A3 series|M60A3]] tanks are used to replicate Soviet T-80s.

During the mid-1990s, JMRC was used to train peacekeeping forces for the former [[Yugoslavia]] under low-intensity conflict missions.  Currently, the OpFor mission has since been modified for counter-insurgency training for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] and [[Operation Enduring Freedom]].

Starting in early 2004, NTC began focusing on training units selected to deploy to [[Iraq]] or [[Afghanistan]] in [[Urban Operations|urban operations]] (UO). Towns of ever increasing size and complexity have been constructed throughout the training area to provide battlefield realism and housing for the hundreds of role-playing personnel, many of whom speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] or [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] natively, and replicate civilians on the battlefield while wearing Afghan or Iraqi clothing. Cultural awareness and liaison operations with local leaders are emphasized at all times and at all levels.

Various US military installations and/or major units have their own local versions of opposing force used for training exercises. The joint Australian/US military exercise "Crocodile '03" featured an Australian-led opposing force in which soldiers from a range of Australian units worked together with a [[US Marine Corps]] contingent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exercise Crocodile '03: You win some, you lose some | author = John Wellfare | url = http://www.defence.gov.au/news/armynews/editions/1084/features/feature01a.htm | publisher = Army: The Soldiers' Newspaper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several [[state defense force]]s have served as OPFOR units when training with the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. The [[California State Military Reserve]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://4thmpbnpmo.com/opfor.htm |title=OPFOR |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=1st Battalion (MP), 2nd Brigade (Civil Support), California State Military Reserve |access-date=16 November 2015 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Georgia State Defense Force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Seay |first=Howard, WO1 |last2= |first2= |date= |title=Operation Roughrider Cold |url=http://issuu.com/allanhayesgsdf/docs/headsup_june2015 |journal=Heads Up |publisher=Georgia State Defense Force |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=3 |doi= |access-date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; have provided OPFOR services to their respective National Guard counterparts.

The [[British Army]] rotates units through [[British Army Training Unit Suffield]] as OPFOR.

The [[Republic of Korea Army|South Korean army]] utilizes a regiment-sized OPFOR unit replicating the [[Korean People's Army Ground Force|North Korean Army]] infantry force at the [[Korea Combat Training Center]].

===Private OPFOR companies===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
There are a number of private companies that provide OPFOR services to support the training missions of various military units. As the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan come to a close, the use of private training forces are on the rise in the Department of Defense. OPFOR companies supplement the existing training programs in a number of ways.{{which|date=November 2017}}

{{Refimprove|date=May 2008}}
{{Biological classification}}
In [[biological classification]], the '''order''' ({{lang-la|ordo}}) is
# a [[taxonomic rank]] used in the classification of organisms and recognized by the [[nomenclature codes]]. Other well-known ranks are [[life]], [[domain (biology)|domain]], [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]], [[phylum]], [[class (biology)|class]], [[family (biology)|family]], [[genus]], and [[species]], with order fitting in between class and family. An immediately higher rank, '''superorder''', may be added directly above order, while '''suborder''' would be a lower rank.
# a taxonomic unit, a [[taxon]], in that rank. In that case the [[plural]] is orders (Latin ''ordines'').

::''Example'': All [[owls]] belong to the order Strigiformes.

What does and does not belong to each order is determined by a [[taxonomist]], as is whether a particular order should be recognized at all. Often there is no exact agreement, with different taxonomists each taking a different position. There are no hard rules that a taxonomist needs to follow in describing or recognizing an order. Some taxa are accepted almost universally, while others are recognised only rarely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Tobin | first1=Allan J. |last2=Dusheck | first2=Jennie | title=Asking About Life | year=2005 | publisher=Cengage Learning | place=Boston | isbn=978-0-030-27044-4 | pp=403–408 | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=cjgdW4SjoJcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For some groups of organisms, consistent suffixes are used to denote that the rank is an order. The Latin [[suffix]] ''-(i)formes'' meaning "having the form of" is used for the [[scientific name]] of orders of [[birds]] and [[fishes]], but not for those of [[mammal]]s and [[invertebrate]]s. The suffix ''-ales'' is for the name of orders of plants, fungi, and algae.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|Article 17.1|ref= McNeill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hierarchy of ranks==

===Zoology===
For some [[clade]]s covered by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], a number of additional classifications are sometimes used, although not all of these are officially recognised.

In their 1997 classification of mammals, McKenna and Bell used two extra levels between superorder and order: "grandorder" and "mirorder".&lt;ref name="McKennaBell1997"&gt;{{Citation |last=McKenna |first=M.C. |last2=Bell |first2=S.G. |year=1997 |title=Classification of Mammals |publication-place=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0-231-11013-6 |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Novacek (1986) inserted them at the same position. [[Michael Benton]] (2005) inserted them between superorder and magnorder instead.&lt;ref name="MichaelJBenton2005_VPalaentology_3rd"&gt;{{cite book | last=Benton | first=Michael J. | year=2005 | title=Vertebrate Palaeontology | edition=3rd | place=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell Publishing | ISBN=978-0-63205-637-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was adopted by Systema Naturae 2000 and others&lt;!-- example: http://taxonomicon.taxonomy.nl/TaxonTree.aspx?id=67730 (Hexaprotodon liberiensis); example https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxonomic_rank --&gt;.

===Botany===
In botany, the ranks of subclass and suborder are secondary ranks pre-defined as respectively above and below the rank of order.&lt;ref name=botarticle4&gt;{{harv|McNeill et al. 2012|Article 4|ref= McNeill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any number of further ranks can be used as long as they are clearly defined.&lt;ref name=botarticle4/&gt;

The superorder rank is commonly used, with the ending -anae that was initiated by [[Armen Takhtajan]]'s publications from 1966 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authors=Naik, V.N. |year=1984  |title=Taxonomy of Angiosperms |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill  |isbn=9780074517888 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=GanmtXAyU0gC |page=111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the concept==
The order as a distinct rank of biological classification having its own distinctive name (and not just called a ''higher [[genus]]'' ''(genus summum))'' was first introduced by the German [[botanist]] [[Augustus Quirinus Rivinus]] in his classification of plants that appeared in a series of treatises in the 1690s. [[Carl Linnaeus]] was the first to apply it consistently to the division of all three [[Kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] of nature ([[mineral]]s, [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s) in his ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' (1735, 1st. Ed.).

===Botany===
[[File:Linnaeus1758-title-page.jpg|thumb|right|Title page of the 1758 edition of Linnaeus's ''Systema Naturæ''.&lt;ref name=Linn1758&gt;{{cite book |last=Linnaeus |first=Carolus |title=Systema naturae per regna tria naturae :secundum classes, ordines, genera, species, cum characteribus, differentiis, synonymis, locis |publisher=Laurentius Salvius |location=Stockholm |year=1758 |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/542 |language=Latin |edition=[[10th edition of Systema Naturae|10th]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For plants, Linnaeus' orders in the ''[[Systema Naturae]]'' and the ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' were strictly artificial, introduced to subdivide the artificial [[Class (biology)|classes]] into more comprehensible smaller groups.  When the word ''ordo'' was first consistently used for natural units of plants, in 19th century works such as the ''[[de Candolle system|Prodromus]]'' of de Candolle and the ''[[Bentham &amp; Hooker system|Genera Plantarum]]'' of Bentham &amp; Hooker, it indicated [[taxa]] that are now given the rank of family (see ''[[ordo naturalis]]'', ''natural order'').

In French botanical publications, from [[Michel Adanson]]'s ''Familles naturelles des plantes'' (1763) and until the end of the 19th century, the word ''famille'' ([[plural]]: ''familles'') was used as a French equivalent for this Latin ''ordo''. This equivalence was explicitly stated in the [[Alphonse Louis Pierre Pyrame de Candolle|Alphonse De Candolle's]] ''Lois de la nomenclature botanique'' (1868), the precursor of the currently used ''[[International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants]]''.

In the first international ''Rules'' of [[botanical nomenclature]] from the [[International Botanical Congress]] of 1905, the word family (''familia'') was assigned to the rank indicated by the French "famille", while order (''ordo'') was reserved for a higher rank, for what in the 19th century had often been named a ''cohors''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Briquet, J. |year=1912  |title=Règles internationales de la nomenclature botanique adoptées par le congrès international de botanique de Vienne 1905, deuxième edition mise au point d'après les décisions du congrès international de botanique de Bruxelles 1910; International rules of botanical nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Congresses of Vienna 1905 and Brussels 1910; Internationale Regeln der botanischen Nomenclatur angenommen von den Internationalen Botanischen Kongressen zu Wien 1905 und Brüssel 1910 |publisher=Gustav Fischer |location=Jena |url=https://archive.org/details/rglesinternati00inteuoft}} Page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; (plural ''cohortes'').

Some of the plant families still retain the names of Linnaean "natural orders" or even the names of pre-Linnaean natural groups recognised by Linnaeus as orders in his natural classification (e.g. ''Palmae'' or ''Labiatae''). Such names are known as [[Descriptive botanical names|descriptive]] family names.

===Zoology===
In [[zoology]], the Linnaean orders were used more consistently. That is, the orders in the zoology part of the ''Systema Naturae'' refer to natural groups. Some of his ordinal names are still in use (e.g. [[Lepidoptera]] for the order of [[moth]]s and [[Butterfly|butterflies]], or [[Diptera]] for the order of [[Fly|flies]], [[mosquito]]es, [[midge]]s, and [[gnat]]s). {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

===Virology===
In [[virology]], the [[International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses]]'s [[virus classification]] includes fifteen taxa: realm, subrealm, kingdom, subkingdom, phylum, subphylum, class, subclass, order, suborder, family, subfamily, genus, subgenus, and species, to be applied for viruses, viroids and  satellite nucleic acids.&lt;ref name=ICTV_2018&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://talk.ictvonline.org/information/w/ictv-information/383/ictv-code|title=ICTV Code.

Wernle was a representative of the ''Religionsgeschichtliche Schule'' ([[history of religions school]]). His expertise was in the field of [[New Testament]] analysis, and he is largely remembered for his work involving [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptic]] and [[Saint Paul|Pauline]] research.

He died in Basel.

Thus the concept of a flying elephant is postdictable (and thus minimally counterintuitive) when set up in the context of [[Operation Dumbo Drop]] because it can be justified in that context.  The concept of a "square triangle that only exists on Wednesdays and eats cats" however does not make any sense and is therefore not postdictable.

[[File:Telephone cable.jpg|thumb|300px|Telephone cable containing multiple twisted-pair lines]]
The '''primary line constants''' are parameters that describe the characteristics of conductive transmission lines, such as pairs of [[copper]] wires, in terms of the physical electrical properties of the line.  The primary line constants are only relevant to transmission lines and are to be contrasted with the [[secondary line constants]], which can be derived from them, and are more generally applicable.  The secondary line constants can be used, for instance, to compare the characteristics of a [[waveguide]] to a copper line, whereas the primary constants have no meaning for a waveguide.

The constants are conductor resistance and inductance, and insulator capacitance and conductance, which are by convention given the symbols ''R'', ''L'', ''C'', and ''G'' respectively. The constants are enumerated in terms of per unit length. The circuit representation of these elements requires a [[distributed element model]] and consequently [[calculus]] must be used to analyse the circuit.  The analysis yields a system of two first order, simultaneous linear [[Partial differential equation|partial differential equations]] which may be combined to derive the secondary constants of [[characteristic impedance]] and [[propagation constant]].

A number of special cases have particularly simple solutions and important practical applications.  Low loss cable requires only ''L'' and ''C'' to be included in the analysis, useful for short lengths of cable.  Low frequency applications, such as [[twisted pair]] telephone lines, are dominated by ''R'' and ''C'' only.  High frequency applications, such as [[Radio frequency|RF]] [[co-axial cable]], are dominated by ''L'' and ''C''.  Lines [[loading coil|loaded]] to prevent distortion need all four elements in the analysis, but have a simple, elegant solution.

==The constants==
There are four primary line constants, but in some circumstances some of them are small enough to be ignored and the analysis can be simplified.  These four, and their symbols and units are as follows:

{|class="wikitable"
!Name!!Symbol!!Units!!Unit symbol
|-
|loop [[electrical resistance|resistance]]||''R''||[[ohm]]s per [[metre]]||Ω/m
|-
|loop [[inductance]]||''L''||[[henry (unit)|henries]] per metre||H/m
|-
|insulator [[capacitance]]||''C''||[[farad]]s per metre||F/m
|-
|insulator [[electrical conductance|conductance]]||''G''||[[siemens (unit)|siemens]] per metre||S/m
|}

''R'' and ''L'' are elements in series with the line (because they are properties of the conductor) and ''C'' and ''G'' are elements shunting the line (because they are properties of the [[dielectric]] material between the conductors).  ''G'' represents leakage current through the dielectric and in most cables is very small.  The word loop is used to emphasise that the resistance and inductance of both conductors must be taken into account.  For instance, if a line consists of two identical wires that have a resistance of 25 mΩ/m each, the ''loop'' resistance is double that, 50 mΩ/m.  Because the values of the constants are quite small, it is common for manufacturers to quote them per kilometre rather than per metre; in the English-speaking world "per mile" can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, p.8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.604-605.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "constant" can be misleading. It means that they are material constants; but they may vary with frequency. In particular, ''R'' is heavily influenced by the [[skin effect]].  Furthermore, while ''G'' has virtually no effect at [[audio frequency]], it can cause noticeable losses at high frequency with many of the [[dielectric]] materials used in cables due to a high [[loss tangent]].  Avoiding the losses caused by ''G'' is the reason many cables designed for use at [[UHF]] are air-insulated or foam-insulated (which makes them virtually air-insulated).&lt;ref&gt;Porges, pp.223-224.&lt;/ref&gt;  The actual meaning of constant in this context is that the parameter is constant with ''distance''.  That is the line is assumed to be homogenous lengthwise.  This condition is true for the vast majority of transmission lines in use today.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.502-503, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Typical values for some common cables==

:† Manufacturers commonly omit a value for inductance in their data sheets.  Some of these values are estimated from the figures for capacitance and characteristic impedance by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle {Z_0}^2=L/C&lt;/math&gt;.

==Circuit representation==
[[File:Line model Heaviside.svg|thumb|400px|'''Fig. 1.''' Equivalent circuit representation of a transmission line using distributed elements. {{math|δ''L''}}, {{math|''δR''}}, {{math|''δC''}} and {{math|''δG''}} are to be read as, {{math|''L''δ''x''}}, {{math|''R''δ''x''}}, {{math|''C''δ''x''}} and {{math|''G''δ''x''}} respectively]]
The line constants cannot be simply represented as [[lumped element model|lumped elements]] in a circuit; they must be described as [[distributed element model|distributed elements]].  For instance "pieces" of the capacitance are in between "pieces" of the resistance.  However many pieces the ''R'' and ''C'' are broken into, it can always be argued they should be broken apart further to properly represent the circuit, and after each division the number of [[mesh analysis|mesh]]es in the circuit is increased.  This is shown diagramtically in figure 1.  To give a true representation of the circuit, the elements must be made [[infinitesimal]]ly small so that each element is distributed along the line.  The infinitesimal elements in an infinitesimal distance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle dx&lt;/math&gt; are given by;&lt;ref name="Connor, pp.8-10"&gt;Connor, pp.8-10.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;span style="line-height:300%;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dL=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(L\delta x)=Ldx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
:&lt;math&gt;dR=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(R\delta x)=Rdx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
:&lt;math&gt;dC=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(C\delta x)=Cdx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
:&lt;math&gt;dG=\lim_{\delta x \to 0}(G\delta x)=Gdx&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;
&lt;/span&gt;
[[File:Line model general impedances.svg|thumb|300px|'''Fig. 2.''' Representation of a transmission line using generalised distributed impedance and admittance elements.]]
It is convenient for the purposes of analysis to roll up these elements into general series [[electrical impedance|impedance]], ''Z'', and shunt [[admittance]], ''Y'' elements such that;
&lt;span style="line-height:300%;"&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;dZ=(R+i \omega L)dx=Zdx\, ,&lt;/math&gt;&amp;ensp; and,
:&lt;math&gt;dY=(G+i \omega C)dx=Ydx\, .&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;
Analysis of this network (figure 2) will yield the secondary line constants: the [[propagation constant]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \gamma&lt;/math&gt;, (whose [[complex analysis|real and imaginary parts]] are the [[attenuation constant]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, and [[phase change constant]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt;, respectively) and the [[characteristic impedance]], &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, which also, in general, will have real, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R_0&lt;/math&gt;, and imaginary, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle X_0&lt;/math&gt;, parts, making a total of four secondary constants to be derived from the four primary constants.  The term constant is even more misleading for the secondary constants as they usually vary quite strongly with frequency, even in an ideal situation where the primary constants do not.  This is because the reactances in the circuit (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 1/(\omega C)&lt;/math&gt;) introduce a dependence on &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.  It is possible to choose specific values of the primary constants that result in &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; being independent of &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; (the [[Heaviside condition]]) but even in this case, there is still &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; which is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.  As with the primary constants, the meaning of "constant" is that the secondary constants do not vary with distance along the line, not that they are independent of frequency.&lt;ref name="Connor, pp.8-10"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hickman, p.113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porges, p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristic impedance==
[[File:Line equivalent circuit for Zo.svg|thumb|250px|'''Fig. 3.''' Equivalent circuit of a transmission line for the calculation of Z&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; from the primary line constants]]
The characteristic impedance of a transmission line, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;, is defined as the impedance looking into an infinitely long line.  Such a line will never return a reflection since the incident wave will never reach the end to be reflected.  When considering a finite length of the line, the remainder of the line can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; as its equivalent circuit.  This is so because the remainder of the line is still infinitely long and therefore equivalent to the original line.  If the finite segment is very short, then in the equivalent circuit it will be modelled by an L-network consisting of one element of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle dZ&lt;/math&gt; and one of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle dY&lt;/math&gt;; the remainder is given by &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;.  This results in the network shown in figure 3, which can be analysed for &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; using the usual [[network analysis (electrical circuits)|network analysis]] theorems,&lt;ref&gt;Porges, pp.216-217.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \delta Z + \frac {Z_0}{1+Z_0 \delta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

which re-arranges to,

:&lt;math&gt;{Z_0}^2 - Z_0 \delta Z = \frac {\delta Z}{\delta Y}&lt;/math&gt;

Taking limits of both sides

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{\delta x \to 0}({Z_0}^2 - Z_0 \delta Z) = {Z_0}^2 = \frac {dZ}{dY}&lt;/math&gt;

and since the line was assumed to be homogenous lengthwise,

:&lt;math&gt;{Z_0}^2 = \frac {Z}{Y}&lt;/math&gt;

==Propagation constant==
[[File:calculation of transmission line propagation constant.svg|thumb|400px|'''Fig. 4.''' Each infinitesimal section of the transmission line causes an infinitesimal drop in the line voltage as it is propagated along the line.  [[Integral|Integrating]] these drops enables the propagation constant to be found.]]
The ratio of the line input voltage to the voltage a distance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta x&lt;/math&gt; further down the line (that is, after one section of the equivalent circuit) is given by a standard [[voltage divider]] calculation.  The remainder of the line to the right, as in the characteristic impedance calculation, is replaced with &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.609-611.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{x1}} = \frac{\delta Z+\frac{Z_0 /\delta Y}{Z_0+1/\delta Y}}{\frac{Z_0 /\delta Y}{Z_0+1/\delta Y}} 
= 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y&lt;/math&gt;

Each infinitesimal section will multiply the voltage drop by the same factor.  After &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle n&lt;/math&gt; sections the voltage ratio will be,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{xn}} = \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y \right)^n&lt;/math&gt;

At a distance &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x&lt;/math&gt; along the line, the number of sections is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle x/\delta x&lt;/math&gt; so that,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{xn}} = \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y \right)^{\frac{x}{\delta x}}&lt;/math&gt;

In the limit as &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta x \to 0&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_{xn}} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} + \delta Z \delta Y \right)^{\frac{x}{\delta x}}&lt;/math&gt;

The second order term &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \delta Z \delta Y &lt;/math&gt; will disappear in the limit, so we can write without loss of accuracy,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {V_\mathrm i}{V_x} = \lim_{\delta x \to 0} \left ( 1 + \frac {\delta Z}{Z_0} \right)^{\frac{x}{\delta x}}&lt;/math&gt;

and comparing with the mathematical identity,

:&lt;math&gt;e^x \equiv \lim_{p \to \infin} (1+1/p)^{px}&lt;/math&gt;

yields,

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm i = V_x e^{\frac{Z}{Z_0}x}&lt;/math&gt;

From the definition of [[propagation constant]],

:&lt;math&gt;V_\mathrm i = V_x e^{\gamma x}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{Z}{Z_0} = \sqrt {ZY}&lt;/math&gt;

==Special cases==

===Ideal transmission line ===
An ideal transmission line will have no loss, which implies that the resistive elements are zero.  It also results in a purely real (resistive) characteristic impedance.  The ideal line cannot be realised in practice, but it is a useful approximation in many circumstances.  This is especially true, for instance, when short pieces of line are being used as circuit components such as [[stub (electronics)|stubs]].  A short line has very little loss and this can then be ignored and treated as an ideal line.  The secondary constants in these circumstances are;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = i \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Twisted pair===
Typically, [[twisted pair]] cable used for audio frequencies or low data rates has line constants dominated by ''R'' and ''C''.  The dielectric loss is usually negligible at these frequencies and ''G'' is close to zero.  It is also the case that, at a low enough frequency, &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R \gg \omega L&lt;/math&gt; which means that ''L'' can also be ignored.  In those circumstances the secondary constants become,&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.18-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx \sqrt {i\omega CR}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx \sqrt \frac{\omega CR}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \approx \sqrt \frac{\omega CR}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 \approx \sqrt \frac{R}{i\omega C} = \sqrt \frac{R}{2\omega C} - i \sqrt \frac{R}{2\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;

The attenuation of this cable type increases with frequency, causing distortion of waveforms.  Not so obviously, the variation of &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; with frequency also causes a distortion of a type called [[dispersion relation|dispersion]].  To avoid dispersion the requirement is that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \beta&lt;/math&gt; is directly proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \omega&lt;/math&gt;.  However, it is actually proportional to &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt \omega&lt;/math&gt; and dispersion results.  &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; also varies with frequency and is also partly reactive; both these features will be the cause of [[Reflections on copper lines|reflections]] from a resistive line termination.  This is another undesirable effect.  The [[nominal impedance]] quoted for this type of cable is, in this case, very nominal, being valid at only one spot frequency, usually quoted at 800&amp;nbsp;Hz or 1&amp;nbsp;kHz.&lt;ref&gt;Bird, pp.612-613.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porges, p.219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Co-axial cable===
Cable operated at a high enough frequency (VHF radio frequency or high data rates) will meet the conditions &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle R \ll \omega L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle G \ll \omega C&lt;/math&gt;.  This must eventually be the case as the frequency is increased for any cable.  Under those conditions ''R'' and ''G'' can both be ignored (except for the purpose of calculating the cable loss) and the secondary constants become;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma \approx i \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha \approx \frac{LG+RC}{2\sqrt{LC}} = \tfrac{1}{2}\left(Z_0 G + \frac{R}{Z_0}\right) \approx \frac{R}{2Z_0}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta \approx \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 \approx \sqrt \frac{L}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Loaded line===
[[Loading coil#Krarup cable|Loaded lines]] are lines designed with deliberately increased inductance. This is done by adding iron or some other magnetic metal to the cable or adding coils. The purpose is to ensure that the line meets the [[Heaviside condition]], which eliminates distortion caused by frequency-dependent attenuation and dispersion, and ensures that &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle Z_0&lt;/math&gt; is constant and resistive. The secondary constants are here related to the primary constants by;&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp.19-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \sqrt {RG} + i \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha  = \sqrt {RG}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\beta = \omega \sqrt {LC}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;Z_0 = \sqrt \frac{L}{C} = \sqrt \frac{R}{G}&lt;/math&gt;

==Velocity==

The velocity of propagation is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; v = \lambda f .&lt;/math&gt;

Since,

:&lt;math&gt; \omega = 2 \pi f &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta = \frac {2 \pi}{\lambda} &lt;/math&gt;

then,

:&lt;math&gt; v = \frac {\omega}{\beta} .&lt;/math&gt;

In cases where {{math|''β''}} can be taken as,

:&lt;math&gt; \beta = \omega \sqrt {LC} &lt;/math&gt;

the velocity of propagation is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; v = {1 \over \sqrt {LC}} .&lt;/math&gt;

The lower the capacitance the higher the velocity.  With an air dielectric cable, which is approximated to with low-loss cable, the velocity of propagation is very close to ''c'', the speed of light ''in vacuo''.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, pp. 10, 19-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7684">'''Randall Herbert Balmer''' (born October 22, 1954) is an American author and a historian of American religion. He taught at [[Barnard College]] and [[Columbia University]] for twenty-seven years before moving to Dartmouth College in 2012, where he was named the Mandel Family Professor in the Arts &amp; Sciences. He is also an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal priest]]. He earned his Ph.D. from [[Princeton University]] in 1985. He has been a visiting professor at [[Dartmouth College]] and at [[Rutgers]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Drew University]], [[Emory University]], [[Yale]] and [[Northwestern University|Northwestern]] universities and at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]], where he was also adjunct professor of church history. He has also taught in the [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism]].&lt;ref name="barnard.columbia.edu"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~religion/faculty/balmer-bio.html# |title=Dartmouth College Dept. of Religion bio |access-date=2013-07-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130909072917/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~religion/faculty/balmer-bio.html# |archive-date=2013-09-09 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was visiting professor at Yale Divinity School from 2004 until 2008.

Following his ordination in 2006 and concurrent with his academic responsibilities, Balmer served as part-time rector of two Episcopal parishes in Connecticut: St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington (2008-2009) and Christ Episcopal Church in Middle Haddam (2010-2012). In addition to his academic writing, Balmer has published commentaries in newspapers across the country, including the ''[[Des Moines Register]],'' the ''Philadelphia Inquirer,'' the ''Dallas Morning News,'' the ''Omaha World Herald,'' the ''Los Angeles Times,'' the ''Anchorage Daily News,'' the ''Hartford Courant,'' the ''St. Louis Post-Dispatch,'' ''New York Newsday,'' the ''Minneapolis Star Tribune,'' and the ''New York Times,'' among others. His work has also appeared in the ''Nation'', the ''New Republic'', the ''Washington Post Book World'', and the ''New York Times Book Review''.

Balmer was nominated for an [[Emmy]] for script-writing and hosting the three-part [[Public Broadcasting Services|PBS]] documentary "Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory," based on his book with the same title.&lt;ref name="barnard.columbia.edu"/&gt;  He also wrote and hosted two other PBS documentaries: "Crusade: The Life of Billy Graham" and "In the Beginning: The Creationist Controversy."

==Balmer's criticisms of the Religious Right==
In various books and articles, Balmer has criticized the politicization of the American Christian [[christian right|evangelical movement]].  In an article titled "Jesus is not a Republican" in the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', Balmer writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Indeed, the most effective and vigorous religious movements in American history have identified with the downtrodden and have positioned themselves on the fringes of society rather than at the centers of power. The [[Methodist]]s of the 19th century come to mind, as do the [[Mormon]]s. In the 20th century, [[Pentecostal]]ism, which initially appealed to the lower classes and made room for women and people of color, became perhaps the most significant religious movement of the century.

The leaders of the religious right have led their sheep astray from the gospel of [[Jesus Christ]] to the false gospel of [[neoconservative]] ideology and into the maw of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. And yet my regard for the flock and my respect for their integrity is undiminished. Ultimately it is they who must reclaim the gospel and rescue us from the distortions of the religious right.

The [[Bible]] I read tells of freedom for captives and deliverance from oppression. It teaches that those who refuse to act with justice or who neglect the plight of those less fortunate have some explaining to do. But the Bible is also about good news. It promises redemption and forgiveness, a chance to start anew and, with divine help, to get it right. My evangelical theology assures me that no one, not even [[Karl Rove]] or [[James Dobson]], lies beyond the reach of redemption, and that even a people led astray can find their way home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/free/v52/i42/42b00601.htm "Jesus Is Not a Republican"] The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Political career ==
In 2003, Balmer ran for a seat on his local school board and lost by four votes.&lt;ref name="columbiaspectator.com"&gt;http://columbiaspectator.com/2004/10/06/popular-barnard-professor-looks-politics-0&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Balmer won the Democratic nomination for a seat representing the 111th District in the [[Connecticut House of Representatives]]. Balmer ran in the general election against incumbent Republican [[John H. Frey]], despite the fact that Balmer had lived in the district for less than three years, Frey had never drawn an opponent, and the town of Ridgefield (which the 111th District represents) was "two-to-one Republican."&lt;ref name="columbiaspectator.com"/&gt; Ultimately, Balmer was defeated in the election. Frey won 8,824 votes, and Balmer won 4,478 votes; Frey won more votes than anyone else in the Connecticut House that year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&amp;q=392548&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other people|Richard Muther}}
'''Richard (Dick) Muther''' (Nov. 20, 1913 - Oct. 15, 2014) is an American consulting engineer, faculty member at MIT, and author. He developed fundamental techniques used in plant layout, material handling, and other aspects of [[industrial engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lorp.net/people.php Library of Online Resources on Planning]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also known as "Mister Systematic."&lt;ref name="KCS 2014"&gt;"Richard "Dick" Muther 1913 - 2014; Obituary." ''The Kansas City Star'' Oct. 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Muther was born 1913 in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] to Lorenz Francis Muther and Josephine (Ashleman) Muther. After attending the [[University of Wisconsin]], he obtained his B.S. and M.S. from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="KCS 2014"/&gt;

In his early career Muther worked for the Methods Engineering Council in Pittsburgh, the consulting firm of [[Harold Bright Maynard]]. In 1956 he founded his own consulting firm, Richard Muther and Associates,&lt;ref&gt; Sharron Kahn Luttrell. " [https://alum.mit.edu/news/AlumniProfiles/Archive/Richard_Muther_-2738-2C_SM_-2741 RICHARD MUTHER '38, SM '41: Early Break Sparks Career in Production Management]," in ''Technology Review,'' MIT May/June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked as consulting engineer for organizations, such as [[Vendo]] in Kansas City, [[General Dynamics]], [[Philips]] in the Netherlands, [[John Deere]], and in the [[People's Republic of China]] for its Department of Energy.&lt;ref name="KCS 2014"/&gt;

In [[World War II]] Muther served in the US Navy as expediter and facilities planning officer. In 1944 he published his first book, entitled ''Production Line Technique,'' on [[mass production]] methods, based on studies at over 75 industrial plants.&lt;ref name="KCS 2014"/&gt;

Over the years Muther had taught at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], at the [[Naval Postgraduate School]], and at [[Robert College]] in Turkey. He was visiting professor and instructor at the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]], and in Europe at the [[ETH Zurich]] in Switzerland, and at the [[Royal Institute of Technology]] in Sweden.&lt;ref name="KCS 2014"/&gt;

Muther received an honorary doctorate ScD(hc) from [[Lund University]] in Sweden. He also was awarded the [[Gilbreth Medal]] (outstanding contributions to Industrial Engineering) in 1962&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Management Office Executive,'' Vol. 1, 1962. p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;; the Materials Handling Award (SAM); the Engineering Citation Award (SME); the Honor Award (IMMS); the Reed-Apple Award (MHIA); and the Donald Francis Award (for outstanding contributions to international material handling.)

== Contributions to engineering ==
Muther was the original developer of relationship chart (REL-CHART) and its companion space-relationship diagram. This tool is the basis for many other techniques which are used to optimize the proximity of related functions and minimize unnecessary transportation in industrial facilities. 

Muther also created the Mag Count method of measuring the difficulty of handling (transporting) any solid material prior to knowing how it will be moved.   He developed the industry-standard color code used to classify industrial space and the related type-of-work symbols.  Corresponding black-and-white hatch patterns based on the heraldic tincture code are also part of his methodology. He is considered the "Father of Systematic Planning".

The '''Rutherford Appleton Laboratory''' ('''RAL''') is one of the national scientific research laboratories in the UK operated by the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] (STFC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stfc.ac.uk/ | date = 23 June 2005 | title = Science and Technology Facilities Council |publisher=Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=2 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as the '''Rutherford High Energy Laboratory''', merged with the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] in 1975 to create the '''Rutherford Lab'''; then in 1979 with the [[Appleton Laboratory]] to form the current laboratory.

It is located on the [[Harwell Science and Innovation Campus]] at [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] near [[Didcot]] in Oxfordshire, United Kingdom. It has a staff of approximately 1,200 people who support the work of over 10,000 scientists and engineers, chiefly from the university research community. The laboratory's programme is designed to deliver trained manpower and economic growth for the UK as the result of achievements in science.

==History==
RAL is named after the [[physicist]]s [[Ernest Rutherford]] and [[Edward Victor Appleton|Edward Appleton]].

The National Institute for Research in Nuclear Science (NIRNS) was formed in 1957 to operate the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory established next to the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] on the former [[RAF Harwell]] airfield between [[Chilton, Oxfordshire|Chilton]] and [[Harwell, Oxfordshire|Harwell]]. The 50 [[Electron volt|MeV]] [[proton]] [[linear accelerator]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/83354m18260g2737/ | date = January 1955 | title = Proton linear accelerators for nuclear research, and the A.E.R.E. 600 MeV project | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento | volume = 2 | pages = 413–422 |accessdate=6 June 2009| doi = 10.1007/BF02746099 | last1 = Pickavance | first1 = T. G. }}&lt;/ref&gt; was transferred from the [[Atomic Energy Research Establishment]] to the new laboratory to become a national facility for particle physics as the [[Nimrod (synchrotron)]]. Some components of this [[linear accelerator]] are still operating as part of the [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]] injector linac over 50 years after their first use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/learning/video/inside-the-isis-linear-particle-accelerator11761.html | date = 6 March 2011 | title = Inside the ISIS linear particle accelerator |publisher=Science and Technology Facilities Council |accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the laboratory has grown both with the expansion of its established facilities, and the incorporation of facilities from other institutions to provide the benefits from [[economies of scale]]. The major mergers were in 1975 with the adjacent [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] creating the Rutherford Laboratory, and then in 1979 with the [[Appleton Laboratory]] to form the current Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. With the closure of the [[Royal Greenwich Observatory]] in 1998, some small offices also moved to RAL. Similarly, laser technology moved to RAL from [[Joint European Torus]] at [[Culham]] to become the foundation of the Central Laser Facility.

To be able to decide the priorities for government funding across all areas of scientific research, the Science &amp; Technology Act of 1965&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1965/plain/cukpga_19650004_en | date = 23 March 1965 | title = Science &amp; Technology Act, 1965 |publisher=[[Office of Public Sector Information]] |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; created the Science Research Council (SRC) which took over management of the Rutherford High Energy Laboratory from NIRNS along with many other previously disparate UK science bodies. To prioritise economic impact over [[blue skies research]], the SRC became the [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (SERC) in the early 1980s, and in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1994/Uksi_19940611_en_1.htm#tcon | date = 5 March 1994 | title = The Research Councils, (Transfer of Property etc) Order 1994 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the SERC was eventually divided into three [[UK Research Councils|Research Councils]] (the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council|EPSRC]], [[Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council|PPARC]] and the [[Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Councils|CCLRC]] – which took responsibility for RAL from EPSRC in 1995&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19950630_en_1.htm | date = 3 March 1995 | title = The Research Councils, (Transfer of Property etc) Order 1995 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), so that each could then focus its development around one of three incompatible business models – administratively efficient short duration grant distribution, medium term commitments to international agreements, long term commitments to staff and facilities provision. To unify the planning of the provision for UK scientists to access large national and international facilities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/pdf/uksi_20070279_en.pdf | date = 7 February 2007 | title = The Science and Technology Facilities Council Order 2007 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007 the CCLRC merged with PPARC and incorporated the [[nuclear physics]] discipline from EPSRC to create the [[Science and Technology Facilities Council]] which then took responsibility for RAL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si2007/pdf/uksi_20070770_en.pdf | date = 8 March 2007 | title = The Research Councils, (Transfer of Property etc) Order 2007 |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=6 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
RAL hosts two of the UK's major scientific facilities:

[[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]] is a [[spallation]] [[neutron source]]. The neutrons it produces are mainly used in [[neutron scattering]] experiments to study the atomic structure and dynamics of materials. [[ISIS neutron source|ISIS Neutron and Muon Source]] has been in operation since 1984, annually supporting a national and international community of 3,000 researchers from academia and industry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://stfc.ukri.org/files/impact-publications/isis-neutron-and-muon-source-lifetime-impact-report/|title=ISIS Lifetime Impact Study|last=|first=|date=|website=stfc.ukri.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=17 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Economic impact==
{{original research|section|date=June 2010}}
In recent years, there has been an increasing political drive towards requiring that the science undertaken at RAL and the technology created there result in a proportional economic benefit to the UK to justify the investment of public funds in the laboratory. RAL management have argued that this is achieved in various ways, including:

* From the commercial products and services resulting from the scientific results which are achieved on the facilities at RAL (e.g., through new materials, new drugs etc.).
* Through the early warning of disasters predicted from terrestrial and space data acquired and analysed at RAL (e.g., radio/mobile phone interference predictions, severe weather predictions etc.).
* Through the training of specialist scientists and engineers at RAL, who then move into commercial companies.
* Through the standardisation of technologies which has resulted in the acceleration of economic growth through interoperability and interchangeability of products — especially in computing.
* By the enthusiasm generated in science by the results of large facilities (e.g., from astronomical images or from particle physics experiments), which leads to schoolchildren choosing scientific training and scientific careers in many fields.
* By technologies developed at RAL during the development of facilities themselves, which are then licensed to UK companies, or spin-out companies.

==In popular culture==
RAL was used as a set for the filming of an episode of [[Terry Nation]]'s [[BBC]] TV series ''[[Blake's 7]]''.

The [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) for [[Ridley Scott]]'s 1979 film ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'' were created at the [[Atlas Computer Laboratory]] which is now part of RAL.

The Space Science department featured in the "In the Box" episode of the [[CBeebies]] series ''[[Nina and the Neurons]]''.

'''Sewage treatment''' is the process of removing [[pollutant|contaminants]] from municipal [[wastewater]], containing mainly household [[sewage]] plus some [[Industrial wastewater treatment|industrial wastewater]]. Physical, chemical, and biological processes are used to remove contaminants and produce treated wastewater (or treated [[effluent]]) that is safe enough for release into the environment. A by-product of sewage treatment is a semi-solid waste or slurry, called [[sewage sludge]]. The sludge has to undergo further [[sewage sludge treatment|treatment]] before being suitable for disposal or application to land.

Sewage treatment may also be referred to as [[wastewater treatment]]. However, the latter is a broader term which can also refer to industrial wastewater. For most cities, the [[sanitary sewer|sewer system]] will also carry a proportion of industrial effluent to the sewage treatment plant which has usually received pre-treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load. If the sewer system is a [[combined sewer]] then it will also carry [[urban runoff]] (stormwater) to the sewage treatment plant. Sewage water can travel towards treatment plants via [[piping]] and in a flow aided by [[gravity]] and [[pump]]s. The first part of filtration of sewage typically includes a [[bar screen]] to filter solids and large objects which are then collected in [[dumpster]]s and disposed of in landfills. [[Fat]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] is also removed before the primary treatment of sewage.

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Terminology==
The term "sewage treatment plant" (or "sewage treatment works" in some countries) is nowadays often replaced with the term '''[[wastewater treatment]] plant''' or wastewater treatment station.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_WV6CgAAQBAJ|title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Reuse|last1=Tchobanoglous|first1=George|last2=Burton|first2=Franklin L.|last3=Stensel|first3=H. David|last4=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2003|isbn=0-07-112250-8|edition=4th|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewage can be treated close to where the sewage is created, which may be called a "decentralized" system or even an "on-site" system (in [[septic tank]]s, [[biofilters]] or [[aerobic treatment system]]s). Alternatively, sewage can be collected and transported by a network of pipes and pump stations to a municipal treatment plant. This is called a "centralized" system (see also [[sanitary sewer|sewerage]] and [[Sewage collection and disposal|pipes and infrastructure]]).

==Origins of sewage==
{{Main|Sewage}}
Sewage is generated by residential, institutional, commercial and industrial establishments. It includes [[household waste]] liquid from [[toilet]]s, [[bathing|baths]], [[shower]]s, [[kitchen]]s, and [[sink]]s draining into [[sanitary sewer|sewer]]s. In many areas, sewage also includes liquid waste from industry and commerce. The separation and draining of household waste into [[greywater]] and [[blackwater (waste)|blackwater]] is becoming more common in the developed world, with treated greywater being permitted to be used for watering plants or recycled for flushing toilets.

===Sewage mixing with rainwater===
Sewage may include [[stormwater]] runoff or [[urban runoff]]. [[Sewerage]] systems capable of handling storm water are known as [[combined sewer]] systems. This design was common when urban sewerage systems were first developed, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name="Metcalf &amp; Eddy"&gt;{{cite book | author=Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc. | title=Wastewater Engineering | year=1972 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |location=New York | isbn=0-07-041675-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} Combined sewers require much larger and more expensive treatment facilities than [[sanitary sewer]]s. Heavy volumes of storm runoff may overwhelm the sewage treatment system, causing a spill or overflow. Sanitary sewers are typically much smaller than combined sewers, and they are not designed to transport stormwater. Backups of raw sewage can occur if excessive [[Infiltration/Inflow|infiltration/inflow]] (dilution by stormwater and/or groundwater) is allowed into a sanitary sewer system. Communities that have [[Urbanization|urbanized]] in the mid-20th century or later generally have built separate systems for sewage (sanitary sewers) and stormwater, because precipitation causes widely varying flows, reducing sewage treatment plant efficiency.&lt;ref name="Burrian"&gt;Burrian, Steven J., et al. (1999).[http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=2000E6J7.txt "The Historical Development of Wet-Weather Flow Management."] US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Cincinnati, OH. Document No. EPA/600/JA-99/275.&lt;/ref&gt;

As rainfall travels over roofs and the ground, it may pick up various contaminants including [[soil]] particles and other [[sediment]], [[heavy metals]], [[organic compound]]s, animal waste, and [[oil]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]. Some [[jurisdiction]]s require stormwater to receive some level of treatment before being discharged directly into waterways. Examples of treatment processes used for stormwater include [[retention basin]]s, [[constructed wetland|wetlands]], buried [[Stormwater detention vault|vaults]] with various kinds of [[media filter]]s, and [[Hydrodynamic separator|vortex separators]] (to remove coarse solids).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burton, Jr. |first1=G.

===Industrial effluent===
{{Main|Industrial wastewater treatment}}
In highly regulated developed countries, [[industrial effluent]] usually receives at least pretreatment if not full treatment at the factories themselves to reduce the pollutant load, before discharge to the sewer. This process is called [[industrial wastewater treatment]] or pretreatment. The same does not apply to many developing countries where industrial effluent is more likely to enter the sewer if it exists, or even the receiving water body, without pretreatment.

Industrial wastewater may contain pollutants which cannot be removed by conventional sewage treatment. Also, variable flow of industrial waste associated with production cycles may upset the population dynamics of biological treatment units, such as the [[Activated sludge|activated sludge process]].

==Process steps==

=== Overview ===
Sewage collection and treatment is typically subject to local, state and federal regulations and standards.

Treating wastewater has the aim to produce an [[effluent]] that will do as little harm as possible when discharged to the surrounding environment, thereby preventing [[pollution]] compared to releasing untreated wastewater into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Environmental Pollution Monitoring And Control |last= Khopkar |first= S. M.|year= 2004|publisher= New Age International |location=New Delhi |isbn= 81-224-1507-5 |page= 299|url= https://books.google.com/?id=TAk21grzDZgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sewage treatment generally involves three stages, called primary, secondary and tertiary treatment.
*''Primary treatment'' consists of temporarily holding the sewage in a quiescent basin where heavy solids can settle to the bottom while oil, grease and lighter solids float to the surface. The settled and floating materials are removed and the remaining liquid may be discharged or subjected to secondary treatment. Some sewage treatment plants that are connected to a combined sewer system have a bypass arrangement after the primary treatment unit. This means that during very heavy rainfall events, the secondary and tertiary treatment systems can be bypassed to protect them from hydraulic overloading, and the mixture of sewage and stormwater only receives primary treatment.
*''[[Secondary treatment]]'' removes dissolved and suspended biological matter. Secondary treatment is typically performed by [[Indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]], water-borne micro-organisms in a managed habitat. Secondary treatment may require a separation process to remove the micro-organisms from the treated water prior to discharge or tertiary treatment.
*''Tertiary treatment'' is sometimes defined as anything more than primary and secondary treatment in order to allow ejection into a highly sensitive or fragile ecosystem (estuaries, low-flow rivers, coral reefs,...). Treated water is sometimes disinfected chemically or physically (for example, by lagoons and [[microfiltration]]) prior to discharge into a [[stream]], [[river]], [[bay]], [[lagoon]] or [[wetland]], or it can be used for the [[irrigation]] of a golf course, green way or park. If it is sufficiently clean, it can also be used for [[groundwater recharge]] or agricultural purposes.

[[File:SchemConstructedWetlandSewage.jpg|upright=3.05|thumb|center|[[Process flow diagram]] for a typical treatment plant via subsurface flow constructed wetlands (SFCW)]]

===Pretreatment===
Pretreatment removes all materials that can be easily collected from the raw sewage before they damage or clog the pumps and sewage lines of primary treatment [[clarifier]]s. Objects commonly removed during pretreatment include trash, tree limbs, leaves, branches, and other large objects.

The influent in sewage water passes through a [[bar screen]] to remove all large objects like cans, rags, sticks, plastic packets etc. carried in the sewage stream.&lt;ref&gt;Water and Environmental Health at London and Loughborough (1999). [http://www.lut.ac.uk/well/resources/technical-briefs/64-wastewater-treatment-options.pdf "Waste water Treatment Options."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717210830/http://www.lut.ac.uk/well/resources/technical-briefs/64-wastewater-treatment-options.pdf |date=2011-07-17 }} Technical brief no. 64. London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine and Loughborough University.&lt;/ref&gt; This is most commonly done with an automated mechanically raked bar screen in modern plants serving large populations, while in smaller or less modern plants, a manually cleaned screen may be used. The raking action of a mechanical bar screen is typically paced according to the accumulation on the bar screens and/or flow rate. The solids are collected and later disposed in a landfill, or incinerated. Bar screens or mesh screens of varying sizes may be used to optimize solids removal. If gross solids are not removed, they become entrained in pipes and moving parts of the treatment plant, and can cause substantial damage and inefficiency in the process.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer"&gt;EPA. Washington, DC (2004). [https://www.epa.gov/npdes/npdes-resources "Primer for Municipal Waste water Treatment Systems."] Document no. EPA 832-R-04-001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

====Grit removal====
&lt;!--[[Grit removal]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
Grit consists of sand, gravel, cinders, and other heavy materials. It also includes organic matter such as eggshells, bone chips, seeds, and coffee grounds. Pretreatment may include a sand or grit channel or chamber, where the velocity of the incoming sewage is adjusted to allow the settlement of sand and grit. Grit removal is necessary to (1) reduce formation of heavy deposits in aeration tanks, aerobic digesters, pipelines, channels, and conduits; (2) reduce the frequency of digester cleaning caused by excessive accumulations of grit; and (3) protect moving mechanical equipment from abrasion and accompanying abnormal wear. The removal of grit is essential for equipment with closely machined metal surfaces such as comminutors, fine screens, centrifuges, heat exchangers, and high pressure diaphram pumps. Grit chambers come in 3 types: horizontal grit chambers, aerated grit chambers and vortex grit chambers. Vortex type grit chambers include mechanically induced vortex, hydraulically induced vortex, and multi-tray vortex separators. Given that traditionally, grit removal systems have been designed to remove clean inorganic particles that are greater than {{convert|0.210|mm}}, most grit passes through the grit removal flows under normal conditions. During periods of high flow deposited grit is resuspended and the quantity of grit reaching the treatment plant increases substantially. It is, therefore important that the grit removal system not only operate efficiently during normal flow conditions but also under sustained peak flows when the greatest volume of grit reaches the plant.&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/858915999 |title=Wastewater Engineering: Treatment and Resource Recovery |others=Tchobanoglous, George; Stensel, H. David; Tsuchihashi, Ryujiro; Burton, Franklin L.; Abu-Orf, Mohammad; Bowden, Gregory |date=2014 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |isbn=9780073401188 |edition=Fifth |location=New York |oclc=858915999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Flow equalization====
[[Clarifier]]s and mechanized secondary treatment are more efficient under uniform flow conditions. [[Equalizing basin|Equalization basins]] may be used for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. Basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during plant maintenance and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment (including portable toilet waste, vehicle holding tanks, and septic tank pumpers). Flow equalization basins require variable discharge control, typically include provisions for bypass and cleaning, and may also include aerators. Cleaning may be easier if the basin is downstream of screening and grit removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=October 1971 |title=Process Design Manual for Upgrading Existing Wastewater Treatment Plants |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100WEPH.txt |publisher=EPA |chapter=Chapter 3. Flow Equalization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fat and grease removal====
In some larger plants, [[fat]] and [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] are removed by passing the sewage through a small tank where skimmers collect the fat floating on the surface. Air blowers in the base of the tank may also be used to help recover the fat as a froth. Many plants, however, use primary clarifiers with mechanical surface skimmers for fat and grease removal.

===Primary treatment===
&lt;!--[[Primary Treatment]] redirects to this section; if the section name is changed, please change this redirect accordingly--&gt;
[[File:Sewer Plant.jpg|upright=1.6|thumb|Primary treatment tanks in Oregon, USA]]
In the primary [[sedimentation (water treatment)|sedimentation]] stage, sewage flows through large tanks, commonly called "pre-settling basins", "primary sedimentation tanks" or "primary [[clarifier]]s".&lt;ref&gt;Huber Company, Berching, Germany (2012). [http://www.huber.de/products/sedimentation-tanks.html "Sedimentation Tanks."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120118005951/http://www.huber.de/products/sedimentation-tanks.html |date=2012-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanks are used to settle sludge while grease and oils rise to the surface and are skimmed off. Primary settling tanks are usually equipped with mechanically driven scrapers that continually drive the collected sludge towards a hopper in the base of the tank where it is pumped to sludge treatment facilities.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|9–11}} Grease and oil from the floating material can sometimes be recovered for [[saponification]] (soap making).

===Secondary treatment===
{{main|Secondary treatment}}
[[Secondary treatment]] is designed to substantially degrade the biological content of the sewage which are derived from human waste, food waste, soaps and detergent. The majority of municipal plants treat the settled sewage liquor using aerobic biological processes. To be effective, the [[biota (ecology)|biota]] require both [[oxygen]] and food to live. The [[bacteria]] and [[protozoa]] consume biodegradable soluble organic contaminants (e.g. [[sugar]]s, fats, organic short-chain [[carbon]] molecules, etc.) and bind much of the less soluble fractions into [[flocculation|floc]].

Secondary treatment systems are classified as fixed-film or suspended-growth systems.
*Fixed-film or attached growth systems include [[trickling filter]]s, [[constructed wetlands]], bio-towers, and [[rotating biological contactor]]s, where the biomass grows on media and the sewage passes over its surface.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|11–13}} The fixed-film principle has further developed into [[Moving bed biofilm reactor|Moving Bed Biofilm Reactors]] (MBBR)&lt;ref&gt;

*Suspended-growth systems include [[activated sludge]], where the biomass is mixed with the sewage and can be operated in a smaller space than trickling filters that treat the same amount of water. However, fixed-film systems are more able to cope with drastic changes in the amount of biological material and can provide higher removal rates for organic material and suspended solids than suspended growth systems.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|11–13}}
[[File:Secondary sedimentation tank 1 w.JPG|thumb|Secondary [[clarifier]] at a rural treatment plant]]
Some secondary treatment methods include a secondary clarifier to settle out and separate biological floc or filter material grown in the secondary treatment bioreactor.

===Tertiary treatment===
The purpose of tertiary treatment is to provide a final treatment stage to further improve the effluent quality before it is discharged to the receiving environment (sea, river, lake, wet lands, ground, etc.). More than one tertiary treatment process may be used at any treatment plant. If disinfection is practised, it is always the final process. It is also called "effluent polishing."

====Filtration====
[[Sand filter|Sand filtration]] removes much of the residual suspended matter.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|22–23}} Filtration over [[activated carbon]], also called ''carbon adsorption,'' removes residual [[toxin]]s.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

====Lagoons or ponds====
[[File:Everett sewage.jpg|thumb|right|A sewage treatment plant and lagoon in [[Everett, Washington]], USA]]
Lagoons or ponds provide settlement and further biological improvement through storage in large man-made ponds or lagoons. These lagoons are highly aerobic and colonization by native [[macrophyte]]s, especially reeds, is often encouraged. Small filter-feeding [[invertebrate]]s such as ''[[Daphnia]]'' and species of ''[[Rotifera]]'' greatly assist in treatment by removing fine particulates.

====Biological nutrient removal====
Biological nutrient removal (BNR) is regarded by some as a type of secondary treatment process,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and by others as a tertiary (or "advanced") treatment process.

Wastewater may contain high levels of the nutrients [[nitrogen]] and [[phosphorus]]. Excessive release to the environment can lead to a buildup of nutrients, called [[eutrophication]], which can in turn encourage the overgrowth of weeds, [[algae]], and [[cyanobacteria]] (blue-green algae). This may cause an [[algal bloom]], a rapid growth in the population of algae. The algae numbers are unsustainable and eventually most of them die. The decomposition of the algae by bacteria uses up so much of the oxygen in the water that most or all of the animals die, which creates more organic matter for the bacteria to decompose. In addition to causing deoxygenation, some algal species produce toxins that contaminate [[drinking water]] supplies. Different treatment processes are required to remove nitrogen and phosphorus.

=====Nitrogen removal=====
Nitrogen is removed through the biological [[redox|oxidation]] of nitrogen from [[ammonia]] to [[nitrate]] ([[nitrification]]), followed by [[denitrification]], the reduction of nitrate to nitrogen gas. Nitrogen gas is released to the atmosphere and thus removed from the water.

Nitrification itself is a two-step aerobic process, each step facilitated by a different type of bacteria. The oxidation of ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) to nitrite (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) is most often facilitated by ''Nitrosomonas'' spp. ("nitroso" referring to the formation of a [[nitroso]] functional group). Nitrite oxidation to nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), though traditionally believed to be facilitated by ''Nitrobacter'' spp. (nitro referring the formation of a [[nitro functional group]]), is now known to be facilitated in the environment almost exclusively by ''Nitrospira'' spp.

Denitrification requires anoxic conditions to encourage the appropriate biological communities to form. It is facilitated by a wide diversity of bacteria. Sand filters, lagooning and reed beds can all be used to reduce nitrogen, but the activated sludge process (if designed well) can do the job the most easily.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|17–18}} Since denitrification is the reduction of nitrate to dinitrogen (molecular nitrogen) gas, an [[electron donor]] is needed. This can be, depending on the waste water, organic matter (from feces), [[sulfide]], or an added donor like [[methanol]]. The sludge in the anoxic tanks (denitrification tanks) must be mixed well (mixture of recirculated mixed liquor, return activated sludge [RAS], and raw influent) e.g. by using [[submersible mixer]]s in order to achieve the desired denitrification.

Sometimes the conversion of toxic ammonia to nitrate alone is referred to as tertiary treatment.

Over time, different treatment configurations have evolved as denitrification has become more sophisticated. An initial scheme, the Ludzack–Ettinger Process, placed an anoxic treatment zone before the aeration tank and clarifier, using the return activated sludge (RAS) from the clarifier as a nitrate source. Influent wastewater (either raw or as effluent from primary clarification) serves as the electron source for the facultative bacteria to metabolize carbon, using the inorganic nitrate as a source of oxygen instead of dissolved molecular oxygen. This denitrification scheme was naturally limited to the amount of soluble nitrate present in the RAS. Nitrate reduction was limited because RAS rate is limited by the performance of the clarifier.

The "Modified Ludzak–Ettinger Process" (MLE) is an improvement on the original concept, for it recycles mixed liquor from the discharge end of the aeration tank to the head of the anoxic tank to provide a consistent source of soluble nitrate for the facultative bacteria. In this instance, raw wastewater continues to provide the electron source, and sub-surface mixing maintains the bacteria in contact with both electron source and soluble nitrate in the absence of dissolved oxygen.

Many sewage treatment plants use [[centrifugal pump]]s to transfer the nitrified mixed liquor from the aeration zone to the anoxic zone for denitrification. These pumps are often referred to as ''Internal Mixed Liquor Recycle'' (IMLR) pumps. IMLR may be 200% to 400% the flow rate of influent wastewater (Q). This is in addition to Return Activated Sludge (RAS) from secondary clarifiers, which may be 100% of Q. (Therefore, the hydraulic capacity of the tanks in such a system should handle at least 400% of annual average design flow (AADF). At times, the raw or primary effluent wastewater must be carbon-supplemented by the addition of methanol, acetate, or simple food waste (molasses, whey, plant starch) to improve the treatment efficiency. These carbon additions should be accounted for in the design of a treatment facility's organic loading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wefnet.org/mopnew/Operation_of_Municipal_Wastewater_Treatment_Plants/Chapter%2022%20Revised_6th%20Edition.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151210203528/http://www.wefnet.org/MOPNEW/Operation_of_Municipal_Wastewater_Treatment_Plants/Chapter%2022%20Revised_6th%20Edition.pdf |archivedate=2015-12-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further modifications to the MLE were to come: Bardenpho and Biodenipho processes include additional anoxic and oxidative processes to further polish the conversion of nitrate ion to molecular nitrogen gas. Use of an anaerobic tank following the initial anoxic process allows for luxury uptake of phosphorus by bacteria, thereby biologically reducing orthophosphate ion in the treated wastewater. Even newer improvements, such as [[Anammox]] Process, interrupt the formation of nitrate at the nitrite stage of nitrification, shunting nitrite-rich mixed liquor activated sludge to treatment where nitrite is then converted to molecular nitrogen gas, saving energy, alkalinity, and secondary carbon sourcing. Anammox™ (ANaerobic AMMonia OXidation) works by artificially extending detention time and preserving denitrifiying bacteria through the use of substrate added to the mixed liquor and continuously recycled from it prior to secondary clarification. Many other proprietary schemes are being deployed, including DEMON™, Sharon-ANAMMOX™, ANITA-Mox™, and DeAmmon™.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=March 2013 |title=Emerging Technologies for Wastewater Treatment and In-Plant Wet Weather Management |chapter=Chapter 3.

=====Phosphorus removal=====
Every adult human excretes between {{convert|200|and|1000|g}} of phosphorus annually. Studies of United States sewage in the late 1960s estimated mean per capita contributions of {{convert|500|g}} in urine and feces, {{convert|1000|g}} in synthetic detergents, and lesser variable amounts used as corrosion and scale control chemicals in water supplies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report |date=1976 |title=Process Design Manual for Phosphorus Removal |url=http://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=20007TYZ.txt |pages=2–1 |publisher=EPA |id=EPA 625/1-76-001a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Source control via alternative detergent formulations has subsequently reduced the largest contribution, but the content of urine and feces will remain unchanged. Phosphorus removal is important as it is a limiting nutrient for algae growth in many fresh water systems. (For a description of the negative effects of algae, ''see'' [[Sewage treatment#Nutrient removal|Nutrient removal]]). It is also particularly important for water reuse systems where high phosphorus concentrations may lead to fouling of downstream equipment such as [[reverse osmosis]].

Phosphorus can be removed biologically in a process called [[enhanced biological phosphorus removal]]. In this process, specific bacteria, called [[polyphosphate-accumulating organisms]] (PAOs), are selectively enriched and accumulate large quantities of phosphorus within their cells (up to 20 percent of their mass). When the biomass enriched in these bacteria is separated from the treated water, these [[biosolids]] have a high [[fertilizer]] value.

Phosphorus removal can also be achieved by chemical [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]], usually with [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s of [[iron]] (e.g. [[ferric chloride]]), [[aluminum]] (e.g. [[alum]]), or lime.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|18}} This may lead to excessive sludge production as hydroxides precipitate and the added chemicals can be expensive. Chemical phosphorus removal requires significantly smaller equipment footprint than biological removal, is easier to operate and is often more reliable than biological phosphorus removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansmiddendorp.blogspot.com/|title=De toekomst voor de waterschappen|last=|first=|date=|website=Hansmiddendorp|access-date=2018-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another method for phosphorus removal is to use granular [[Laterite#Waste water treatment|laterite]].

Some systems use both biological phosphorus removal and chemical phosphorus removal.  The chemical phosphorus removal in those systems may be used as a backup system, for use when the biological phosphorus removal is nor removing enough phosphorus, or may be used continuously.  In either case, using both biological and chemical phosphorus removal has the advantage of not increasing sludge production as much as chemical phosphorus removal on its own, with the disadvantage of the increased initial cost associated with installing two different systems.

Once removed, phosphorus, in the form of a phosphate-rich [[sewage sludge]], may be dumped in a landfill or used as fertilizer. In the latter case, the treated sewage sludge is also sometimes referred to as biosolids.

====Disinfection====
{{Further|Advanced oxidation process}}
The purpose of [[disinfection]] in the treatment of waste water is to substantially reduce the number of [[microorganism]]s in the water to be discharged back into the environment for the later use of drinking, bathing, irrigation, etc. The effectiveness of disinfection depends on the quality of the water being treated (e.g., cloudiness, pH, etc.), the type of disinfection being used, the disinfectant dosage (concentration and time), and other environmental variables. Cloudy water will be treated less successfully, since solid matter can shield organisms, especially from [[ultraviolet light]] or if contact times are low. Generally, short contact times, low doses and high flows all militate against effective disinfection. Common methods of disinfection include [[ozone]], [[chlorine]], ultraviolet light, or sodium hypochlorite.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|16}} [[Chloramine]], which is used for drinking water, is not used in the treatment of waste water because of its persistence. After multiple steps of disinfection, the treated water is ready to be released back into the [[water cycle]] by means of the nearest body of water or agriculture. Afterwards, the water can be transferred to reserves for everyday human uses.

[[Water chlorination|Chlorination]] remains the most common form of waste water disinfection in [[North America]] due to its low cost and long-term history of effectiveness. One disadvantage is that chlorination of residual organic material can generate chlorinated-organic compounds that may be [[carcinogenic]] or harmful to the environment. Residual chlorine or chloramines may also be capable of chlorinating organic material in the natural aquatic environment. Further, because residual chlorine is toxic to aquatic species, the treated effluent must also be chemically dechlorinated, adding to the complexity and cost of treatment.

[[Ultraviolet]] (UV) light can be used instead of chlorine, iodine, or other chemicals. Because no chemicals are used, the treated water has no adverse effect on organisms that later consume it, as may be the case with other methods. UV radiation causes damage to the [[gene]]tic structure of bacteria, [[virus]]es, and other [[pathogen]]s, making them incapable of reproduction. The key disadvantages of UV disinfection are the need for frequent lamp maintenance and replacement and the need for a highly treated effluent to ensure that the target microorganisms are not shielded from the UV radiation (i.e., any solids present in the treated effluent may protect microorganisms from the UV light). In the United Kingdom, UV light is becoming the most common means of disinfection because of the concerns about the impacts of chlorine in chlorinating residual organics in the wastewater and in chlorinating organics in the receiving water. Some sewage treatment systems in Canada and the US also use UV light for their effluent water disinfection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=Tapas K. |date=August 2001 |title=Ultraviolet disinfection application to a wastewater treatment plant |journal=Clean Technologies and Environmental Policy |publisher=Springer Berlin/Heidelberg |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=69–80 |url= |doi=10.1007/S100980100108}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Florida Department of Environmental Protection. Tallahassee, FL. [http://www.dep.state.fl.us/water/wastewater/dom/domuv.htm "Ultraviolet Disinfection for Domestic Waste water."] 2010-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ozone]] ({{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is generated by passing oxygen ({{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) through a high [[voltage]] potential resulting in a third oxygen [[atom]] becoming attached and forming {{oxygen}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Ozone is very unstable and reactive and oxidizes most organic material it comes in contact with, thereby destroying many pathogenic microorganisms. Ozone is considered to be safer than chlorine because, unlike chlorine which has to be stored on site (highly poisonous in the event of an accidental release), ozone is generated on-site as needed. Ozonation also produces fewer disinfection by-products than chlorination. A disadvantage of ozone disinfection is the high cost of the ozone generation equipment and the requirements for special operators.

=== Fourth treatment stage ===
{{Further|Environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products}}
Micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals, ingredients of household chemicals, chemicals used in small businesses or industries, [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]] (EPPP) or pesticides may not be eliminated in the conventional treatment process (primary, secondary and tertiary treatment) and therefore lead to [[water pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;UBA (Umweltbundesamt) (2014): [http://www.umweltbundesamt.de/sites/default/files/medien/378/publikationen/texte_85_2014_massnahmen_zur_verminderung_des_eintrages_von_mikroschadstoffen_in_die_gewaesser_0.pdf Maßnahmen zur Verminderung des Eintrages von Mikroschadstoffen in die Gewässer]. Texte 85/2014&lt;/ref&gt; Although concentrations of those substances and their decomposition products are quite low, there is still a chance to harm aquatic organisms. For [[pharmaceuticals]], the following substances have been identified as "toxicologically relevant": substances with [[Endocrine disruptor|endocrine disrupting]] effects, [[Genotoxicity|genotoxic]] substances and substances that enhance the development of [[Antimicrobial resistance|bacterial resistances]].&lt;ref name="Walz"&gt;Walz, A., Götz, K.

ISOE-Materialien zur Sozialen Ökologie Nr. 36 (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; They mainly belong to the group of [[environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutant]]s. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in Germany, Switzerland{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Hernández Leal, L. (2010). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1363 Removal of micropollutants from grey water – Combining biological and physical/chemical processes]. PhD thesis, Wageningen University&lt;/ref&gt; However, since those techniques are still costly, they are not yet applied on a regular basis. Such process steps mainly consist of [[activated carbon]] filters that adsorb the micropollutants. Ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method.&lt;ref&gt;Ternes, T. (2009): [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1378 Challenges for the future: emerging micropollutants in urban water cycle]. BFG, Koblenz, Germany (presentation for a seminar at UNESCO-IHE, Delft)&lt;/ref&gt; Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Margot | first1 = J. | display-authors = etal | year = 2013 | title = Bacterial versus fungal laccase: potential for micropollutant degradation| url = | journal = AMB Express | volume = 3 | issue = | page = 63 | doi = 10.1186/2191-0855-3-63 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants and at the same time to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.biooekonomie-bw.de/en/articles/news/crude-mushroom-solution-to-degrade-micropollutants-and-increase-the-performance-of-biofuel-cells/|title=Crude mushroom solution to degrade micropollutants and increase the performance of biofuel cells|website=www.biooekonomie-bw.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microbial biofuel cells are investigated for their property to treat organic matter in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Logan | first1 = B. | last2 = Regan | first2 = J. | year = 2006 | title = Microbial Fuel Cells—Challenges and Applications| doi = 10.1021/es0627592 | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 40| issue = 17| pages = 5172–5180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To reduce pharmaceuticals in water bodies, also "source control" measures are under investigation, such as innovations in drug development or more responsible handling of drugs.&lt;ref name="Walz" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lienert | first1 = J. | last2 = Bürki | first2 = T. | last3 = Escher | first3 = B.I. | year = 2007 | title = Reducing micropollutants with source control: Substance flow analysis of 212 pharmaceuticals in faeces and urine | url = http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/1406 | journal = Water Science &amp; Technology | volume = 56 | issue = 5| pages = 87–96 | doi=10.2166/wst.2007.560}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Odor control==
[[Odors]] emitted by sewage treatment are typically an indication of an anaerobic or "septic" condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Harshman |first1=Vaughan |last2=Barnette |first2=Tony |date=2000-12-28|title=Wastewater Odor Control: An Evaluation of Technologies |journal=Water Engineering &amp; Management |volume= |issue= |pages= |url=http://www.wwdmag.com/Wastewater-Odor-Control-An-Evaluation-of-Technologies-article1698 |issn=0273-2238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early stages of processing will tend to produce foul-smelling gases, with [[hydrogen sulfide]] being most common in generating complaints. Large process plants in urban areas will often treat the odors with carbon reactors, a contact media with bio-slimes, small doses of [[chlorine]], or circulating fluids to biologically capture and metabolize the noxious gases.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, James D. and Welles Products Corporation (1976).[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4421534.html "Tower for removing odors from gases."] U.S. Patent No. 4421534.&lt;/ref&gt; Other methods of odor control exist, including addition of iron salts, [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[calcium nitrate]], etc. to manage [[hydrogen sulfide]] levels.

[[High-density solids pump]]s are suitable for reducing odors by conveying sludge through hermetic closed pipework.

== Energy requirements ==
For conventional sewage treatment plants, around 30 percent of the annual operating costs is usually required for energy.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1703}} The energy requirements vary with type of treatment process as well as wastewater load. For example, [[constructed wetland]]s have a lower energy requirement than [[activated sludge]] plants, as less energy is required for the aeration step.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, H., Platzer, C., von Münch, E., Winker, M. (2011). [http://www.susana.org/en/resources/library/details/930 Technology review of constructed wetlands – Subsurface flow constructed wetlands for greywater and domestic wastewater treatment]. Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH, Eschborn, Germany, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Sewage treatment plants that produce biogas in their [[sewage sludge treatment]] process with [[anaerobic digestion]] can produce enough energy to meet most of the energy needs of the sewage treatment plant itself.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1505}}

In conventional secondary treatment processes, most of the electricity is used for aeration, pumping systems and equipment for the dewatering and drying of [[sewage sludge]]. Advanced wastewater treatment plants, e.g. for nutrient removal, require more energy than plants that only achieve primary or secondary treatment.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;{{rp|1704}}

==Sludge treatment and disposal==
{{main|Sewage sludge treatment}}
The sludges accumulated in a wastewater treatment process must be treated and disposed of in a safe and effective manner. The purpose of digestion is to reduce the amount of [[organic matter]] and the number of disease-causing [[microorganism]]s present in the solids. The most common treatment options include [[anaerobic digestion]], [[aerobic digestion]], and [[composting]]. [[Incineration]] is also used, albeit to a much lesser degree.&lt;ref name="EPA Primer" /&gt;{{rp|19–21}}

Sludge treatment depends on the amount of solids generated and other site-specific conditions. Composting is most often applied to small-scale plants with aerobic digestion for mid-sized operations, and anaerobic digestion for the larger-scale operations.

The sludge is sometimes passed through a so-called pre-thickener which de-waters the sludge. Types of pre-thickeners include centrifugal sludge thickeners&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/centrifuge-thickening-and-dewatering|publisher=EPA|access-date=16 October 2017|title=Centrifuge Thickening and Dewatering}}&lt;/ref&gt; rotary drum sludge thickeners and belt filter presses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/biosolids/belt-filter-press|publisher=EA|access-date=16 October 2017|title=Belt Filter Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dewatered sludge may be incinerated or transported offsite for disposal in a landfill or use as an agricultural soil amendment.

==Environment aspects==

Many processes in a wastewater treatment plant are designed to mimic the natural treatment processes that occur in the environment, whether that environment is a natural water body or the ground. If not overloaded, bacteria in the environment will consume organic contaminants, although this will reduce the levels of oxygen in the water and may significantly change the overall [[ecology]] of the receiving water. Native bacterial populations feed on the organic contaminants, and the numbers of disease-causing microorganisms are reduced by natural environmental conditions such as predation or exposure to [[ultraviolet]] radiation. Consequently, in cases where the receiving environment provides a high level of dilution, a high degree of wastewater treatment may not be required. However, recent evidence has demonstrated that very low levels of specific contaminants in wastewater, including [[hormone]]s (from [[animal husbandry]] and residue from human [[hormonal contraception]] methods) and synthetic materials such as [[phthalate]]s that mimic hormones in their action, can have an unpredictable adverse impact on the natural biota and potentially on humans if the water is re-used for drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/444304/1290036/1290100/1290353/1294402/1311542/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |title=Environment Agency (archive) – Persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic PBT substances |accessdate=2012-11-14 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060804195610/http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/business/444304/1290036/1290100/1290353/1294402/1311542/?version=1&amp;lang=_e |archivedate=August 4, 2006 |df= }}. environment-agency.gov.uk.

USGS&lt;/ref&gt; In the US and [[European Union|EU]], uncontrolled discharges of wastewater to the environment are not permitted under law, and strict water quality requirements are to be met, as clean drinking water is essential.

A significant threat in the coming decades will be the increasing uncontrolled discharges of wastewater within rapidly developing countries.

===Effects on biology===
Sewage treatment plants can have multiple effects on nutrient levels in the water that the treated sewage flows into. These nutrients can have large effects on the biological life in the water in contact with the effluent.
[[Stabilization pond]]s (or sewage treatment ponds) can include any of the following:
* Oxidation ponds, which are aerobic bodies of water usually {{convert|1|–|2|m}} in depth that receive effluent from sedimentation tanks or other forms of primary treatment.
:* Dominated by [[algae]]
* Polishing ponds are similar to oxidation ponds but receive effluent from an oxidation pond or from a plant with an extended mechanical treatment.
:* Dominated by [[zooplankton]]
* [[Facultative lagoon]]s, raw sewage lagoons, or sewage lagoons are ponds where sewage is added with no primary treatment other than coarse screening. These ponds provide effective treatment when the surface remains aerobic; although anaerobic conditions may develop near the layer of settled sludge on the bottom of the pond.&lt;ref name="Metcalf &amp; Eddy" /&gt;{{rp|552–554}}
* Anaerobic lagoons are heavily loaded ponds.
:* Dominated by [[bacteria]]
* Sludge lagoons are aerobic ponds, usually {{convert|2|to|5|m}} in depth, that receive anaerobically digested primary sludge, or activated secondary sludge under water.
:* Upper layers are dominated by algae &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00288330.1968.9515271|author=Haughey, A. |year=1968|title=The Planktonic Algae of Auckland Sewage Treatment Ponds|journal=New Zealand Journal of Marine and Freshwater Research|volume=2|issue=4|pages=721–766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phosphorus limitation is a possible result from sewage treatment and results in flagellate-dominated [[plankton]], particularly in summer and fall.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, W.T. (1972). "Nutrients and Phytoplankton in Lake Washington." in ''Nutrients and Eutrophication: The Limiting Nutrient Controversy.'' American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Special Symposia. Vol. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[phytoplankton]] study found high nutrient concentrations linked to sewage effluents. High nutrient concentration leads to high [[chlorophyll a]] concentrations, which is a proxy for primary production in marine environments. High primary production means high [[phytoplankton]] populations and most likely high zooplankton populations, because zooplankton feed on phytoplankton. However, effluent released into marine systems also leads to greater population instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Caperon, J.|author2=Cattell, S. A.|author3=Krasnick, G.|lastauthoramp=yes|url=http://www.nospam.aslo.org/lo/toc/vol_16/issue_4/0599.pdf|title=Phytoplankton Kinetics in a Subtropical Estuary: Eutrophication|journal=Limnology and Oceanography|volume=16|issue=4|pages=599–607|year=1971|doi=10.4319/lo.1971.16.4.0599}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The planktonic trends of high populations close to input of treated sewage is contrasted by the [[bacterial]] trend. In a study of ''[[Aeromonas]]'' spp. in increasing distance from a wastewater source, greater change in seasonal cycles was found the furthest from the effluent. This trend is so strong that the furthest location studied actually had an inversion of the ''Aeromonas'' spp. cycle in comparison to that of [[fecal coliforms]]. Since there is a main pattern in the cycles that occurred simultaneously at all stations it indicates seasonal factors (temperature, solar radiation, phytoplankton) control of the bacterial population. The effluent dominant species changes from ''Aeromonas caviae'' in winter to ''Aeromonas sobria'' in the spring and fall while the inflow dominant species is ''Aeromonas caviae'', which is constant throughout the seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmc=184551 |pmid=2389929 |year=1990 |last1=Monfort |first1=P |last2=Baleux |first2=B |title=Dynamics of Aeromonas hydrophila, Aeromonas sobria, and Aeromonas caviae in a sewage treatment pond |volume=56 |issue=7 |pages=1999–2006 |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reuse ==
{{Main|Reclaimed water}}
With suitable technology, it is possible to reuse sewage effluent for drinking water, although this is usually only done in places with limited water supplies, such as [[Windhoek]] and [[Singapore]].&lt;ref&gt;PUB (Singapore National Water Agency)(2011). [http://www.pub.gov.sg/about/historyfuture/Pages/NEWater.aspx "NEWater: History."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130610102220/http://www.pub.gov.sg/about/historyfuture/pages/newater.aspx |date=2013-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[arid]] countries, treated wastewater is often used in [[agriculture]]. For example, in Israel, about 50 percent of agricultural water use (total use was {{convert|1000000000|m3|spell=in}} in 2008) is provided through reclaimed sewer water. Future plans call for increased use of treated sewer water as well as more [[desalination plant]]s as part of [[water supply and sanitation in Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Farming in Israel, without a drop to spare |first=Andrew |last=Martin |newspaper=New York Times |date=2008-08-10 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/10/business/worldbusiness/10iht-10feed.15134930.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Constructed wetland]]s fed by wastewater provide both treatment and [[habitats]] for flora and fauna. Another example for reuse combined with treatment of sewage are the [[East Kolkata Wetlands]] in India. These wetlands are used to treat [[Kolkata]]'s sewage, and the nutrients contained in the wastewater sustain fish farms and agriculture.

== Developing countries ==
[[File:Sewage treatment plant in Gobabis, Namibia (2018).jpg|thumb|Sewage treatment plant in [[Gobabis]], [[Namibia]] (2018) {{Coordinate|NS=-22.476398|EW= 18.951620|type=landmark|region=NA-OH|text=ICON2|name=Sewage treatment Gobabis, Namibia}}]]
Few reliable figures exist on the share of the wastewater collected in sewers that is being treated in the world. A global estimate by [[UNDP]] and [[UN-Habitat]] is that 90% of all wastewater generated is released into the environment untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Corcoran, E., C. Nellemann, E. Baker, R. Bos, D. Osborn, H. Savelli (eds)|title=Sick water? : the central role of wastewater management in sustainable development : a rapid response assessment|date=2010|publisher=UNEP/GRID-Arendal|location=Arendal, Norway|isbn=978-82-7701-075-5|url=http://www.unep.org/pdf/SickWater_screen.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many developing countries the bulk of domestic and industrial wastewater is discharged without any treatment or after primary treatment only.

In Latin America about 15 percent of collected wastewater passes through treatment plants (with varying levels of actual treatment). In [[Venezuela]], a below average country in [[South America]] with respect to wastewater treatment, 97 percent of the country’s [[sewage]] is discharged raw into the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Appropriate Technology for Sewage Pollution Control in the Wider Caribbean Region |last = Caribbean Environment Programme |year=1998 |publisher= United Nations Environment Programme |location=Kingston, Jamaica |isbn= |pages= |url=http://www.cep.unep.org/publications-and-resources/technical-reports/tr40en.pdf |accessdate=2009-10-12}} Technical Report No. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Iran]], a relatively developed [[Middle East]]ern country, the majority of [[Tehran]]'s population has totally untreated sewage injected to the city’s groundwater.&lt;ref&gt;Massoud Tajrishy and Ahmad Abrishamchi (2005).

''Water Conservation, Reuse, and Recycling: Proceedings of the Iranian-American Workshop''. Washington, D.C.: National Academies Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the construction of major parts of the sewage system, collection and treatment, in Tehran is almost complete, and under development, due to be fully completed by the end of 2012. In Isfahan, Iran's third largest city, sewage treatment was started more than 100 years ago.

Only few cities in [[sub-Saharan Africa]] have sewer-based [[sanitation]] systems, let alone wastewater treatment plants, an exception being South Africa and – until the late 1990s – Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;Zimbabwe: [https://www.hrw.org/news/2013/11/19/zimbabwe-water-and-sanitation-crisis Water and Sanitation Crisis], Human Rights Watch, &lt;/ref&gt; Instead, most urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa rely on on-site sanitation systems without sewers, such as [[septic tanks]] and [[pit latrines]], and [[fecal sludge management]] in these cities is an enormous challenge.&lt;ref&gt;Chowdhry, S., Koné, D.

==History==
{{Further|History of water supply and sanitation}}
[[File:FaradayFatherThames.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Great Stink]] of 1858 stimulated research into the problem of sewage treatment. In this caricature in ''[[The Times]]'', [[Michael Faraday]] reports to ''Father [[River Thames|Thames]]'' on the state of the river.]]
Basic sewer systems were used for waste removal in ancient [[Mesopotamia]], where vertical shafts carried the waste away into cesspools. Similar systems existed in the [[Indus Valley]] civilization in modern-day India and in Ancient [[Crete]] and [[Greece]]. In the [[Middle Ages]] the sewer systems built by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] fell into disuse and waste was collected into cesspools that were periodically emptied by workers known as 'rakers' who would often sell it as [[fertilizer]] to farmers outside the city.

Modern sewage systems were first built in the mid-nineteenth century as a reaction to the exacerbation of sanitary conditions brought on by heavy [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]]. Due to the contaminated water supply, [[cholera]] outbreaks occurred in [[Cholera outbreaks and pandemics|1832, 1849 and 1855]] in [[London]], killing tens of thousands of people. This, combined with the [[Great Stink]] of 1858, when the smell of untreated human waste in the [[River Thames]] became overpowering, and the report into sanitation reform of the [[Royal Commission]]er [[Edwin Chadwick]],&lt;ref name=Ashton-Ubido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton|first=John|author2=Ubido, Janet|title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea|journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine|year=1991|volume=4|issue=1|pages=173–181|url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|accessdate=8 July 2013|doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf|archivedate=24 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; led to the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers]] appointing [[Joseph Bazalgette]] to construct a vast underground sewage system for the safe removal of waste. Contrary to Chadwick's recommendations, Bazalgette's system, and others later built in [[Continental Europe]], did not pump the sewage onto farm land for use as fertilizer; it was simply piped to a natural waterway away from population centres, and pumped back into the environment.

===Early attempts===
One of the first attempts at diverting sewage for use as a fertilizer in the farm was made by the [[cotton mill]] owner [[James Smith (inventor)|James Smith]] in the 1840s. He experimented with a piped distribution system initially proposed by James Vetch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GV1YAAAAYAAJ|title=A short description of the plans of Captain James Vetch for the sewerage of the metropolis|author=Lewis Dunbar B. Gordon|year=1851}}&lt;/ref&gt; that collected sewage from his factory and pumped it into the outlying farms, and his success was enthusiastically followed by Edwin Chadwick and supported by organic chemist [[Justus von Liebig]].

The idea was officially adopted by the [[Health of Towns Association|Health of Towns Commission]], and various schemes (known as sewage farms) were trialled by different municipalities over the next 50 years. At first, the heavier solids were channeled into ditches on the side of the farm and were covered over when full, but soon flat-bottomed tanks were employed as reservoirs for the sewage; the earliest patent was taken out by William Higgs in 1846 for "tanks or reservoirs in which the contents of sewers and drains from cities, towns and villages are to be collected and the solid animal or vegetable matters therein contained, solidified and dried..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=w6tvSwAACAAJ|title=History of Sewage Treatment in Britain|author=H. H. Stanbridge|year=1976|publisher=Institute of Water Pollution Control}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements to the design of the tanks included the introduction of the horizontal-flow tank in the 1850s and the radial-flow tank in 1905. These tanks had to be manually de-sludged periodically, until the introduction of automatic mechanical de-sludgers in the early 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvsde.paho.org/bvsacd/leeds/cooper.pdf|title=Historical aspects of wastewater treatment|author=P. F. Cooper|accessdate=2013-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precursor to the modern [[septic tank]] was the [[cesspool]] in which the water was sealed off to prevent contamination and the solid waste was slowly liquified due to anaerobic action; it was invented by L.H Mouras in France in the 1860s. Donald Cameron, as [[Surveying|City Surveyor]] for [[Exeter]] patented an improved version in 1895, which he called a 'septic tank'; septic having the meaning of 'bacterial'. These are still in worldwide use, especially in rural areas unconnected to large-scale sewage systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NXnX4KkV00YC|title=The Sanitary City: Environmental Services in Urban America from Colonial Times to the Present|author=Martin V. Melosi|year=2010|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|page=110|isbn=978-0-8229-7337-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological treatment===
[[File:Frankland Edward 1894.jpg|thumb|[[Edward Frankland]], a distinguished chemist, who demonstrated the possibility of chemically treating sewage in the 1870s]]

It was not until the late 19th century that it became possible to treat the sewage by biologically decomposing the organic components through the use of [[microorganism]]s and removing the pollutants. Land treatment was also steadily becoming less feasible, as cities grew and the volume of sewage produced could no longer be absorbed by the farmland on the outskirts.

[[Edward Frankland]] conducted experiments at the sewage farm in [[Croydon]], England, during the 1870s and was able to demonstrate that filtration of sewage through porous gravel produced a nitrified effluent (the ammonia was converted into nitrate) and that the filter remained unclogged over long periods of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-2rWpwJevEC|title=Edward Frankland: Chemistry, Controversy and Conspiracy in Victorian England|author=Colin A. Russell|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|pages=372–380|isbn=978-0-521-54581-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; This established the then revolutionary possibility of biological treatment of sewage using a contact bed to oxidize the waste. This concept was taken up by the chief chemist for the London [[Metropolitan Board of Works]], William Libdin, in 1887:
:...in all probability the true way of purifying sewage...will be first to separate the sludge, and then turn into neutral effluent... retain it for a sufficient period, during which time it should be fully aerated, and finally discharge it into the stream in a purified condition. This is indeed what is aimed at and imperfectly accomplished on a sewage farm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=thEigV6yl64C|title=Advances in Water Treatment and Pollution Prevention|author1=Sharma, Sanjay Kumar |author2=Sanghi, Rashmi |year=2012|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-007-4204-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1885 to 1891 filters working on this principle were constructed throughout the UK and the idea was also taken up in the US at the [[Lawrence Experiment Station]] in [[Massachusetts]], where Frankland's work was confirmed. In 1890 the LES developed a '[[trickling filter]]' that gave a much more reliable performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ironwood.cpe.uchicago.edu/CPE_Workshop/paper/Cain-Rotella-Sept2005.pdf|title=Epidemics, demonstration effects, and municipal investment in sanitation capital.|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904172532/http://ironwood.cpe.uchicago.edu/CPE_Workshop/paper/Cain-Rotella-Sept2005.pdf|archivedate=2006-09-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact beds were developed in [[City of Salford|Salford]], [[Lancashire]] and by scientists working for the [[London City Council]] in the early 1890s. According to Christopher Hamlin, this was part of a conceptual revolution that replaced the philosophy that saw "sewage purification as the prevention of decomposition with one that tried to facilitate the biological process that destroy sewage naturally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homepages.ucl.ac.uk/~ucessjb/Hamlin%201992.pdf|title=Edwin Chadwick and the Engineers, 1842–1854: Systems and Antisystems in the Pipe-and-Brick Sewers War Technology and Culture|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact beds were tanks containing the inert substance, such as stones or slate, that maximized the surface area available for the microbial growth to break down the sewage. The sewage was held in the tank until it was fully decomposed and it was then filtered out into the ground. This method quickly became widespread, especially in the UK, where it was used in [[Leicester]], [[Sheffield]], [[Manchester]] and [[Leeds]]. The bacterial bed was simultaneously developed by Joseph Corbett as Borough Engineer in [[City of Salford|Salford]] and experiments in 1905 showed that his method was superior in that greater volumes of sewage could be purified better for longer periods of time than could be achieved by the contact bed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZRY6rrpKFGgC|title=Aerobic Wastewater Treatment Processes: History and Development|author=Tilley, David F.|year=2011|publisher=IWA Publishing|date=2011|isbn=978-1-84339-542-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Royal Commission on Sewage Disposal published its eighth report in 1912 that set what became the international standard for sewage discharge into rivers; the '20:30 standard', which allowed {{convert|20|mg}} [[Biochemical oxygen demand]] and {{convert|30|mg}} suspended solid per litre ({{convert|1|l|USgal|disp=out}}).&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/cu31924003641929 Final report of the commissioners appointed to inquire and report what methods of treating and disposing of sewage (1912)]. us.archive.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Brando''' is a private resort located on the atoll of [[Tetiaroa]] in [[French Polynesia]]. The Brando serves as a regulated airstrip, research facility, eco-resort and spa on the Motu of Onetahi. The resort consists of 80 staff and facilities management personnel.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.linkedin.com/search/results/people/?facetCurrentCompany=%5B%2210274106%22%5D LinkedIn]", The Brando, LinkedIn, February 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The atoll's inside on which The Brando is located is on a 99-year lease contracted by [[Marlon Brando]].

==Travel==
Traveling to The Brando can only be commercially done by air. Air Teti'aroa flies private planes between the island of [[Tahiti]] and Teti'aroa. The airline's departure is located in a private terminal at the [[Fa'a'ā International Airport]] in Tahiti.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.tahitiislandstravel.com/our-experiences/air-tetiaroa Air Tetiaroa]",Tahiti Travel Islands, February 3, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
Air Tatiaroa rates to The Brando Resort on Tetiaroa fluctuate with the regular, high and festive seasons.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.paltino.com/the-brando/pricing/#airtetiaroa Air Tetiaroa Rates]",Paltino Air Teteiaroa, April 9, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Construction of The Brando Resort began in 2009 by Teti'aroa Pacific Beachcomber SC. The first phase of the building included repairing the airstrip runway for smoother plane landing and lengthening the tarmac to meet current aviation standards. Additionally, a reef dock was constructed to enable shipments from the ocean to the lagoon side of the reef. 

In February 2014, it was announced that construction on The Brando Resort was officially completed. In July 2014, The Brando was officially open to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://howtospendit.ft.com/destinations/48103-marlon-brandos-private-island-escape-in-polynesia the Brando opening in July 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Eight of [[Marlon Brando]]’s eleven children were involved in the project along with the Brando Estate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/guymartin/2015/01/06/an-island-named-desire-11000-per-night-bungalows-on-marlon-brandos-tahitian-hideaway/ The Brando, Forbes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
The buildings are made using materials that are of local or certified origin, renewable, or recycled. There is a deep seawater air-conditioning (SWAC) system to reduce energy demands.
Renewable energy sources such as solar power (from [[PV panel]]s) and coconut oil ([[biofuel]]) are used.
The [[Zinc–bromine_battery|zinc-bromine&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.energystorageexchange.org/projects/1038 Tetiaroa Brando Resort battery type]&lt;/ref&gt; flow batteries]] (used for storing the power from the PV panels) are made from recyclable materials.
The resort's vehicles are electric or human-powered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://thebrando.com/stewardship/ The Brando]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tragedy''' (from the {{lang-grc-gre|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | [[Middle English]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Middle French]] ''tragedie'' &lt; [[Latin]] ''tragoedia'' &lt; {{lang-grc|[[wiktionary:τραγῳδία|τραγῳδία]]}}, ''tragōidia''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Tragedy | page = 1637 | first = E | last = Klein | title = A Comprehensive Etymological Dictionary of the English Language | volume = II L–Z | publisher = Elsevier | year = 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;}})  is a form of [[drama]] based on human [[suffering]] that invokes an accompanying [[catharsis]] or pleasure in audiences.{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Nietzsche | 1999 | p = 21 | loc = §2 | ps =: ‘two-fold mood[…] the strange mixture and duality in the affects of the [[Dionysus|Dionysiac]] [[Cult of Dionysus|enthusiasts]], that phenomenon whereby pain awakens pleasure while rejoicing wrings cries of agony from the breast.  From highest joy there comes a cry of horror or a yearning lament at some irredeemable loss.  In those Greek festivals there erupts what one might call a [[Sentimentality|sentimental]] tendency in nature, as if it had cause to sigh over its [[Sparagmos|dismemberment]] into [[Individuation|individuals]]’.}}  While many [[culture]]s have developed forms that provoke this [[paradox]]ical response, the term ''tragedy'' often refers to a specific [[Poetic tradition|tradition]] of drama that has played a unique and important role historically in the self-definition of [[Western culture|Western civilisation]].{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 1118}}{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 14–16}}  That tradition has been multiple and discontinuous, yet the term has often been used to invoke a powerful effect of [[cultural identity]] and historical continuity—"the [[Classical Athens|Greeks]] and the [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethans]], in one cultural form; [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenes]] and [[Christian]]s, in a common activity," as [[Raymond Williams]] puts it.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | p = 16}}

From its origins in the [[theatre of ancient Greece]] 2500 years ago, from which there survives only a fraction of the work of [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]], as well as a large number of fragments from other poets; through its singular articulations in the works of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], [[Lope de Vega]], [[Jean Racine]], and [[Friedrich Schiller]] to the more recent [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalistic]] tragedy of [[August Strindberg]]; [[Samuel Beckett]]'s [[Modernism|modernist]] meditations on death, loss and suffering; [[Heiner Müller|Müller's]] [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]] reworkings of the tragic canon; and [[Joshua Oppenheimer]]'s incorporation of tragic pathos in his nonfiction film, ''[[The Act of Killing]]'' (2012), tragedy has remained an important site of cultural experimentation, negotiation, struggle, and change.{{Sfn | Williams | 1966 | pp = 13–84}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}  A long line of [[philosophers]]—which includes [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]], [[Voltaire]], [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]], [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]],{{Sfn | Benjamin | 1998}} [[Albert Camus|Camus]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]], and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuze]]{{Sfn | Deleuze | Guattari | 1972}}—have analysed, speculated upon, and criticised the genre.{{Sfn | Felski | 2008 | p = 1}}{{Sfn | Dukore | 1974 | ps =: primary material.}}{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}

In the wake of Aristotle's ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'' (335 BCE), tragedy has been used to make [[genre]] distinctions, whether at the scale of [[poetry]] in general (where the tragic divides against [[Epic poetry|epic]] and [[Lyric poetry|lyric]]) or at the scale of the drama (where tragedy is opposed to [[Comedy (drama)|comedy]]). In the [[Modernity|modern]] era, tragedy has also been defined against drama, [[melodrama]], [[Tragicomedy|the tragicomic]], and [[epic theatre]].{{Sfn | Carlson | 1993 | ps =: analysis.}}{{Sfn | Pfister | 1977}}{{Sfn | Elam | 1980}}  [[Drama]], in the narrow sense, cuts across the traditional division between comedy and tragedy in an anti- or a-[[Genre|generic]] [[deterritorialization|deterritorialisation]] from the [[Nineteenth century theatre|mid-19th century]] onwards. Both [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Augusto Boal]] define their [[epic theatre]] projects ([[non-Aristotelian drama]] and [[Theatre of the Oppressed]], respectively) against models of tragedy. Taxidou, however, reads epic theatre as an incorporation of tragic functions and its treatments of mourning and speculation.{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | pp = 193–209}}

== Origin ==
[[File:Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure.pdf|thumb|Aristotle's Tragic Plot Structure]]
The word "tragedy" appears to have been used to describe different phenomena at different times. It derives from [[Ancient Greek language|Classical Greek]] {{lang |grc|τραγῳδία}}, [[sandhi|contracted]] from ''trag(o)-aoidiā'' = "[[goat]] [[Ode|song]]", which comes from ''tragos'' = "he-goat" and ''aeidein'' = "to sing" (''[[cf.]]'' "ode"). Scholars suspect this may be traced to a time when a goat was either the prize&lt;ref&gt;See [[Horace]], ''Epistulae'', II, 3, 220: "Carmino qui tragico vilem certavit ob hircum".&lt;/ref&gt; in a competition of [[Greek dances|choral dancing]] or was that around which a [[Greek chorus|chorus]] danced prior to the animal's [[ritual]] [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}  In another view on the etymology, [[Athenaeus|Athenaeus of Naucratis]] (2nd–3rd century CE) says that the original form of the word was ''trygodia'' from ''trygos'' (grape harvest) and ''ode'' (song), because those events were first introduced during grape harvest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Literature/Literature-idx?type=turn&amp;entity=Literature.AthV1.p0071&amp;id=Literature.AthV1&amp;isize=M&amp;pview=hide%20 | first = Athenaeus | last = of Naucratis | title = The deipnosophists | publisher = Wisc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 335 BCE (long after the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of [[Classical Greece|5th-century]] [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] tragedy), [[Aristotle]] provides the earliest-surviving explanation for the origin of the [[drama]]tic [[The arts|art form]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', in which he argues that tragedy developed from the [[improvisation]]s of the leader of [[Greek chorus|choral]] [[dithyramb]]s ([[hymn]]s sung and danced in praise of [[Dionysos]], the god of wine and fertility):{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 13}}
{{Quote |Anyway, arising from an improvisatory beginning (both tragedy and comedy—tragedy from the leaders of the dithyramb, and comedy from the leaders of the phallic processions which even now continue as a custom in many of our cities), [tragedy] grew little by little, as [the poets] developed whatever [new part] of it had appeared; and, passing through many changes, tragedy came to a halt, since it had attained its own nature. | Poetics IV, 1449a 10–15{{Sfn | Janko | 1987 | p = 6}}}}

In the same work, Aristotle attempts to provide a scholastic definition of what tragedy is:
{{Quote |Tragedy is, then, an enactment of a deed that is important and complete, and of [a certain] magnitude, by means of language enriched [with ornaments], each used separately in the different parts [of the play]: it is enacted, not [merely] recited, and through pity and fear it effects relief ([[catharsis]]) to such [and similar] emotions. | Poetics, VI 1449b 2–3&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Aristotle, Poetics, section 1449b | publisher = Tufts | url = http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0056%3Asection%3D1449b}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

There is some dissent to the dithyrambic origins of tragedy, mostly based on the differences between the shapes of their choruses and styles of dancing.{{Citation needed|date= June 2012}} A common descent from pre-[[Ancient Greece|Hellenic]] fertility and burial rites has been suggested.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] discussed the origins of Greek tragedy in his early book ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872). Here, he suggests the name originates in the use of a chorus of goat-like [[satyr]]s in the original [[dithyramb]]s from which the tragic genre developed.

Scott Scullion writes:  {{quote|There is abundant evidence for tragoidia understood as "song for the prize goat". The best-known evidence is Horace, Ars poetica 220-24 ("he who with a tragic song competed for a mere goat"); the earliest is the Parian Marble, a chronicle inscribed about 264/63 BCE, which records, under a date between 538 and 528 BCE: "Thespis is the poet ... first produced ... and as prize was established the billy goat" (FrGHist 239A, epoch 43); the clearest is Eustathius 1769.45: "They called those competing tragedians, clearly because of the song over the billy goat"...&lt;ref&gt;Scott Scullion: "Tragedy and Religion: The Problem of Origins", in Gregory (ed.), A Companion to Greek Tragedy, 2008, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AdTuNrx6z4oC&amp;q=%22There+is+abundant+ancient+evidence%22#v=snippet&amp;q=%22There%20is%20abundant%20ancient%20evidence%22&amp;f=false p. 29]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{Main|Greek tragedy}}
Athenian tragedy—the oldest surviving form of tragedy—is a type of [[dance]]-drama that formed an important part of the theatrical culture of the city-state.{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 441}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pages = 3–5}}{{Sfn | Goldhill | 1997 | p = 54}}{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 206}}{{Sfn | Styan | 2000 | p = 140}}{{Sfn | Taxidou | 2004 | p = 104 | ps =: “most scholars now call 'Greek' tragedy 'Athenian' tragedy, which is historically correct”.}}  Having emerged sometime during the 6th century BCE, it flowered during the 5th century BCE (from the end of which it began to spread throughout the Greek world), and continued to be popular until the beginning of the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 32–3}}{{Sfn | Brown | 1998 | p = 444}}{{Sfn | Cartledge | 1997 | pp = 3–5, 33 | ps =: [although [[Classical Athens|Athenians]] of the 4th century judged [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]] "as the nonpareils of the [[genre]], and regularly honored their plays with revivals, tragedy itself was not merely a 5th-century phenomenon, the product of a short-lived [[Fifth-century Athens|golden age]]. If not attaining the quality and stature of the fifth-century 'classics', original tragedies nonetheless continued to be written and produced and competed with in large numbers throughout the remaining life of the [[Athenian democracy|democracy]]—and beyond it".}}  No tragedies from the 6th century and only 32 of the more than a thousand that were performed in the 5th century have survived.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 15}}{{Sfn | Kovacs | 2005 | p = 379}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | We have seven by Aeschylus, seven by Sophocles, and eighteen by Euripides. In addition, we also have the ''[[Cyclops (play)|Cyclops]]'', a satyr play by Euripides.  Some critics since the 17th century have argued that one of the tragedies that the classical tradition gives as Euripides'—''[[Rhesus (play)|Rhesus]]''—is a 4th-century play by an unknown author; modern scholarship agrees with the classical authorities and ascribes the play to Euripides.{{Sfn | Walton | 1997 | pp = viii, xix}}  This uncertainty accounts for Brockett and Hildy's figure of 31 tragedies.}}  We have complete texts [[Extant literature|extant]] by [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 15}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | The theory that ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' was not written by [[Aeschylus]] adds a fourth, anonymous playwright to those whose work survives.}}

Athenian tragedies were performed in late March/early April at an annual state religious festival in honor of Dionysus. The presentations took the form of a contest between three playwrights, who presented their works on three successive days. Each playwright offered a tetralogy consisting of three tragedies and a concluding comic piece called a [[satyr play]].{{sfn|Lucas|1954|p=7}} The four plays sometimes featured linked stories. Only one complete trilogy of tragedies has survived, the ''[[Oresteia]]'' of Aeschylus. The Greek theatre was in the open air, on the side of a hill, and performances of a trilogy and satyr play probably lasted most of the day. Performances were apparently open to all citizens, including women, but evidence is scant.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The theatre of Dionysus at Athens probably held around 12,000 people.{{Sfn | Ley | 2007 | p = 33–34}}

All of the choral parts were sung (to the accompaniment of an ''[[aulos]]'') and some of the actors' answers to the chorus were sung as well. The play as a whole was composed in various verse metres. All actors were male and wore masks. A [[Greek chorus]] danced as well as sang, though no one knows exactly what sorts of steps the chorus performed as it sang. Choral songs in tragedy are often divided into three sections: strophe ("turning, circling"), antistrophe ("counter-turning, counter-circling") and epode ("after-song").

Many ancient Greek tragedians employed the ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'' as a theatrical device, which was a platform hidden behind the scene that could be rolled out to display the aftermath of some event which had happened out of sight of the audience. This event was frequently a brutal murder of some sort, an act of violence which could not be effectively portrayed visually, but an action of which the other characters must see the effects in order for it to have meaning and emotional resonance. A prime example of the use of the ''ekkyklêma'' is after the murder of [[Agamemnon (play)|Agamemnon]] in the first play of Aeschylus' ''Oresteia'', when the king's butchered body is wheeled out in a grand display for all to see. Variations on the ''ekkyklêma'' are used in tragedies and other forms to this day, as writers still find it a useful and often powerful device for showing the consequences of extreme human actions. Another such device was a crane, the [[mechane]], which served to hoist a god or goddess on stage when they were supposed to arrive flying. This device gave origin to the phrase "[[deus ex machina]]" ("god out of a machine"), that is, the surprise intervention of an unforeseen external factor that changes the outcome of an event.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Following the expansion of the [[Roman Republic]] (509–27 BCE) into several Greek territories between 270–240 BCE, Rome encountered [[Theatre of ancient Greece|Greek tragedy]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}  From the later years of the republic and by means of the [[Roman Empire]] (27 BCE-476 CE), theatre spread west across Europe, around the Mediterranean and even reached England.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 36, 47}}  While Greek tragedy continued to be performed throughout the Roman period, the year 240 BCE marks the beginning of regular [[Theatre of ancient Rome|Roman drama]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 43}}{{Refn | group = "lower-alpha" | For more information on the ancient Roman dramatists, see [[:Category:Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights|the articles categorised under "Ancient Roman dramatists and playwrights" in Wikipedia]].}}  [[Livius Andronicus]] began to write Roman tragedies, thus creating some of the first important works of [[Latin literature|Roman literature]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  Five years later, [[Gnaeus Naevius]] also began to write tragedies (though he was more appreciated for his comedies).{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 47}}  No complete early Roman tragedy survives, though it was highly regarded in its day; historians know of three other early tragic playwrights—[[Quintus Ennius]], [[Marcus Pacuvius]] and [[Lucius Accius]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | p = 49}}

From the time of the empire, the tragedies of two playwrights survive—one is an unknown author, while the other is the [[Stoicism|Stoic philosopher]] [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]].{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}  Nine of [[Senecan tragedy|Seneca's tragedies]] survive, all of which are ''fabula crepidata'' (tragedies adapted from Greek originals); his ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'', for example, was based on [[Euripides]]' ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]''.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 49–50}}  Historians do not know who wrote the only [[Extant literature|extant]] example of the ''fabula praetexta'' (tragedies based on Roman subjects), ''[[Octavia (play)|Octavia]]'', but in former times it was mistakenly attributed to Seneca due to his appearance as a [[Character (arts)|character]] in the tragedy.{{Sfn | Brockett | Hildy | 2003 | pp = 50}}

Seneca's tragedies rework those of all three of the Athenian tragic playwrights whose work has survived. Probably meant to be recited at [[elite]] gatherings, they differ from the Greek versions in their long declamatory, narrative accounts of action, their obtrusive moralising, and their bombastic rhetoric. They dwell on detailed accounts of horrible deeds and contain long reflective [[soliloquies]]. Though the gods rarely appear in these plays, ghosts and witches abound. Senecan tragedies explore ideas of [[Revenge tragedy|revenge]], the occult, the supernatural, suicide, blood and gore. The Renaissance scholar [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] (1484–1558), who knew both Latin and Greek, preferred Seneca to Euripides.

===Influence of Greek and Roman===
Classical Greek drama was largely forgotten in Western Europe from the Middle Ages to the beginning of the 16th century. [[Medieval theatre]] was dominated by [[mystery play]]s, [[morality play]]s, [[farce]]s and [[miracle play]]s. In Italy, the models for tragedy in the later Middle Ages were Roman, particularly the works of Seneca, interest in which was reawakened by the [[Padua]]n [[Lovato Lovati|Lovato de' Lovati]] (1241–1309).&lt;ref name=lovati&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/lovato-de-lovati/ "Lovati, Lovato de'"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; His pupil [[Albertino Mussato]] (1261–1329), also of Padua, in 1315 wrote the [[Latin verse]] tragedy ''Eccerinis'', which uses the story of the tyrant [[Ezzelino III da Romano]] to highlight the danger to Padua posed by [[Cangrande della Scala]] of [[Verona]].&lt;ref name=muss&gt;[http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/albertino-mussato// "Mussato, Albertino"], ''Treccani: Enciclopedie on line'' (in Italian). Accessed March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first secular tragedy written since Roman times, and may be considered the first Italian tragedy identifiable as a Renaissance work. The earliest tragedies to employ purely classical themes are the ''Achilles'' written before 1390 by [[Antonio Loschi]] of [[Vicenza]] (c.1365–1441) and the ''Progne'' of the [[Venice|Venetian]] [[Gregorio Correr]] (1409–1464) which dates from 1428–29.&lt;ref name=eb&gt;"Drama", ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', eleventh edition, Vol. '''VIII''', p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1515 [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1478–1550) of Vicenza wrote his tragedy ''Sophonisba'' in the [[vernacular]] that would later be called [[Italian language|Italian]]. Drawn from [[Livy]]'s account of [[Sophonisba]], the [[Carthage|Carthaginian]] princess who drank poison to avoid being taken by the Romans, it adheres closely to classical rules. It was soon followed by the ''Oreste'' and ''Rosmunda'' of Trissino's friend, the Florentine [[Giovanni di Bernardo Rucellai]] (1475–1525). Both were completed by early 1516 and are based on classical Greek models, ''Rosmunda'' on the ''[[Hecuba]]'' of [[Euripides]],  and ''Oreste'' on the ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris]]'' of the same author; like ''Sophonisba'', they are in Italian and in blank (unrhymed) [[hendecasyllable]]s. Another of the first of all modern tragedies is ''A Castro'', by [[Portugal|Portuguese]] poet and playwright [[António Ferreira]], written around 1550 (but only published in 1587) in polymetric verse (most of it being blank hendecasyllables), dealing with the murder of [[Inês de Castro]], one of the most dramatic episodes in Portuguese history.   Although these three Italian plays are often cited, separately or together, as being the first regular tragedies in modern times, as well as the earliest substantial works to be written in blank hendecasyllables, they were apparently preceded by two other works in the vernacular: ''Pamfila'' or ''Filostrato e Panfila'' written in 1498 or 1508 by [[Antonio Cammelli]] (Antonio da Pistoia); and a ''Sophonisba'' by [[Galeotto del Carretto]] of 1502.&lt;ref name=hallam&gt;Henry Hallam (1837) [https://books.google.com/books?id=M8JMAAAAcAAJ ''Introduction to the Literature of Europe in the Fifteenth, Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries''].

From about 1500 printed copies, in the original languages, of the works of [[Sophocles]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], and [[Euripides]], as well as comedic writers such as [[Aristophanes]], [[Terence]] and [[Plautus]], were available in Europe and the next forty years saw [[Humanism|humanists]] and poets translating and adapting their tragedies.  In the 1540s, the European university setting (and especially, from 1553 on, the Jesuit colleges) became host to a Neo-Latin theatre (in Latin) written by scholars. The influence of Seneca was particularly strong in its humanist tragedy. His plays, with their ghosts, lyrical passages and rhetorical oratory, brought a concentration on rhetoric and language over dramatic action to many humanist tragedies.

The most important sources for French tragic theatre in the Renaissance were the example of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and the precepts of [[Horace]] and [[Aristotle]] (and contemporary commentaries by [[Julius Caesar Scaliger]] and [[Lodovico Castelvetro]]), although plots were taken from classical authors such as [[Plutarch]], [[Lives of the Twelve Caesars|Suetonius]], etc., from the Bible, from contemporary events and from short story collections (Italian, French and Spanish).  The Greek tragic authors ([[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]) would become increasingly important as models by the middle of the 17th century. Important models were also supplied by the [[Spanish Golden Age]] playwrights [[Pedro Calderón de la Barca]], [[Tirso de Molina]] and [[Lope de Vega]], many of whose works were translated and adapted for the French stage.

{{see also|English Renaissance theatre|Shakespearean tragedy|Revenge play|Domestic tragedy}}

The common forms are the:
* ''Tragedy of circumstance'': people  are born into their situations, and do not choose them; such tragedies explore the consequences of birthrights, particularly for monarchs
* ''Tragedy of miscalculation'': the [[protagonist]]'s error of judgement has tragic consequences
* ''[[Revenge play]]''

In English, the most famous and most successful tragedies are those of [[William Shakespeare]] and his [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] contemporaries. Shakespeare's tragedies include:
* ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''
* ''[[Coriolanus]]''
* ''[[Hamlet]]''
* ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''
* ''[[King Lear]]''
* ''[[Macbeth]]''
* ''[[Othello]]''
* ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]''
* ''[[Timon of Athens]]''
* ''[[Titus Andronicus]]''
* ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]''

A contemporary of Shakespeare, [[Christopher Marlowe]], also wrote examples of tragedy in English, notably:
* ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus]]''
* ''[[Tamburlaine (play)|Tamburlaine the Great]]''

[[John Webster]] (1580?–1635?), also wrote famous plays of the genre:
* ''[[The Duchess of Malfi]]''
* ''[[The White Devil]]''

===Opera===
Contemporary with Shakespeare, an entirely different approach to facilitating the rebirth of tragedy was taken in Italy.  [[Jacopo Peri]], in the preface to his ''[[Euridice (opera)|Euridice]]'' refers to "the ancient Greeks and Romans (who in the opinion of many sang their staged tragedies throughout in representing them on stage)."{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 22}}  The attempts of Peri and his contemporaries to recreate ancient tragedy gave rise to the new Italian musical genre of [[opera]]. In France, tragic operatic works from the time of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]] to about that of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck]] were not called opera, but ''tragédie en musique'' ("tragedy in music") or some similar name; the ''tragédie en musique'' is regarded as a distinct musical genre.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Graham Sadler, [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/44040 "Tragédie en musique"], Grove Music Online (subscription required). Accessed March 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Some later operatic [[composer]]s have also shared Peri's aims: [[Richard Wagner]]'s concept of ''[[Gesamtkunstwerk]]'' ("integrated work of art"), for example, was intended as a return to the ideal of Greek tragedy in which all the arts were blended in service of the drama.{{Sfn | Headington | Westbrook | Barfoot | 1991 | p = 178}} [[Nietzsche]], in his ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) was to support Wagner in his claims to be a successor of the ancient dramatists.

==Neo-classical==
[[File:Talma as Nero in Britannicus by Racine - Delacroix - zeno.jpg|thumb|190px|French actor [[François-Joseph Talma|Talma]] as Nero in Racine's ''[[Britannicus (play)|Britannicus]].]]
For much of the 17th century, [[Pierre Corneille]], who made his mark on the world of tragedy with plays like ''Medée'' (1635) and ''Le Cid'' (1636), was the most successful writer of French tragedies. Corneille's tragedies were strangely un-tragic (his first version of ''Le Cid'' was even listed as a tragicomedy), for they had happy endings. In his theoretical works on theatre, Corneille redefined both comedy and tragedy around the following suppositions:
* The stage—in both comedy and tragedy—should feature noble characters (this would eliminate many low-characters, typical of the farce, from Corneille's comedies). Noble characters should not be depicted as vile (reprehensible actions are generally due to non-noble characters in Corneille's plays).
* Tragedy deals with affairs of the state (wars, dynastic marriages); comedy deals with love. For a work to be tragic, it need not have a tragic ending.
* Although [[Aristotle]] says that [[catharsis]] (purgation of emotion) should be the goal of tragedy, this is only an ideal. In conformity with the moral codes of the period, plays should not show evil being rewarded or nobility being degraded.

Corneille continued to write plays through 1674 (mainly tragedies, but also something he called "heroic comedies") and many continued to be successes, although the "irregularities" of his theatrical methods were increasingly criticised (notably by [[François Hédelin, abbé d'Aubignac]]) and the success of Jean Racine from the late 1660s signalled the end of his preeminence.

[[Jean Racine]]'s tragedies—inspired by Greek myths, [[Euripides]], [[Sophocles]] and [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]—condensed their plot into a tight set of passionate and duty-bound conflicts between a small group of noble characters, and concentrated on these characters' double-binds and the geometry of their unfulfilled desires and hatreds. Racine's poetic skill was in the representation of [[pathos]] and amorous passion (like [[Phèdre]]'s love for her stepson) and his impact was such that emotional crisis would be the dominant mode of tragedy to the end of the century. Racine's two late plays ("Esther" and "Athalie") opened new doors to biblical subject matter and to the use of theatre in the education of young women. Racine also faced criticism for his irregularities: when his play, ''[[Bérénice]]'', was criticised for not containing any deaths, Racine disputed the conventional view of tragedy.

==Bourgeois==
{{further|Bourgeois tragedy|Augustan drama}}

Bourgeois tragedy (German: Bürgerliches Trauerspiel) is a form that developed in 18th-century Europe. It was a fruit of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the emergence of the [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois class]] and its ideals. It is characterised by the fact that its protagonists are ordinary citizens. The first true bourgeois tragedy was an English play, [[George Lillo]]'s ''The London Merchant; or, the History of George Barnwell'', which was first performed in 1731. Usually, [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]]'s play ''Miss Sara Sampson'', which was first produced in 1755, is said to be the earliest ''Bürgerliches Trauerspiel'' in Germany.

==Modern development==
In [[modernist literature]], the definition of tragedy has become less precise. The most fundamental change has been the rejection of Aristotle's dictum that true tragedy can only depict those with power and high status. [[Arthur Miller]]'s essay "Tragedy and the Common Man" (1949) argues that tragedy may also depict ordinary people in domestic surroundings.{{sfn|Miller|1949|p=894}} British playwright [[Howard Barker]] has argued strenuously for the rebirth of tragedy in the contemporary theatre, most notably in his volume ''[[Arguments for a Theatre]]''. "You emerge from tragedy equipped against lies. After the musical, you're anybody's fool," he insists.{{sfn|Barker|1989|p=13}} Critics such as [[George Steiner]] have even been prepared to argue that tragedy may no longer exist in comparison with its former manifestations in classical antiquity. In ''The Death of Tragedy'' (1961) George Steiner outlined the characteristics of Greek tragedy and the traditions that developed from that period. In the Foreword (1980) to a new edition of his book Steiner concluded that ‘the dramas of Shakespeare are not a renascence of or a humanistic variant of the absolute tragic model. They are, rather, a rejection of this model in the light of tragi-comic and “realistic” criteria.’ In part, this feature of Shakespeare’s mind is explained by his bent of mind or imagination which was ‘so encompassing, so receptive to the plurality of diverse orders of experience.’ When compared to the drama of Greek antiquity and French classicism Shakespeare’s forms are ‘richer but hybrid'.&lt;ref&gt;George Steiner, ''The Death of Tragedy'' [1961] (Oxford University Press, 1980; Yale University Press, 1996), p. xiii. See also George Steiner, ‘ “Tragedy.” Reconsidered.’ ''New Literary History'' 35:1 (Winter 2004), pp. 1-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==
===Aristotle===
{{further|Poetics (Aristotle)}}

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his work [[Poetics (Aristotle)|''Poetics'']] that
tragedy is characterised by seriousness and involves a great [[person]] who experiences a reversal of [[luck|fortune]] (''[[Peripeteia]]''). Aristotle's [[definition]] can include a change of fortune from bad to good as in the ''[[The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', but he says that the change from good to bad as in ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'' is preferable because this induces [[pity]] and [[fear]] within the spectators. Tragedy results in a [[catharsis]] (emotional cleansing) or healing for the audience through their experience of these emotions in response to the suffering of the characters in the drama.

According to [[Aristotle]], "the [[structure]] of the best tragedy should not be simple but complex and one that represents incidents arousing [[fear]] and [[pity]]—for that is peculiar to this form of art."&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', Trans. W.H. Fyfe. Cambridge: Harvard UP, 1932. Section 1452b&lt;/ref&gt;  This reversal of fortune must be caused by the tragic hero's ''[[hamartia]]'', which is often translated as either a [[character flaw]], or as a mistake (since the original Greek etymology traces back to ''hamartanein'', a sporting term that refers to an [[archery|archer]] or [[spear]]-thrower missing his target).&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, Amelie Oksenberg. ''[[Literary criticism|Essays on Aristotle’s Poetics]]''. Princeton: Princeton UP, 1992. Page 178&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], "The misfortune is brought about not by [general] vice or depravity, but by some [particular] error or frailty."&lt;ref&gt;''Poetics'', Aristotle&lt;/ref&gt;  The reversal is the inevitable but unforeseen result of some action taken by the hero. It is also a misconception that this reversal can be brought about by a higher power (e.g. the [[law]], the [[god]]s, [[destiny|fate]], or [[society]]), but if a character’s downfall is brought about by an external cause, [[Aristotle]] describes this as a [[misadventure]] and not a tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics''. Section 1135b&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the tragic hero may achieve some revelation or recognition ([[anagnorisis]]--"knowing again" or "knowing back" or "knowing throughout") about human fate, destiny, and the will of the gods. Aristotle terms this sort of recognition "a change from ignorance to awareness of a bond of love or hate."

In ''Poetics'', Aristotle gave the following definition in [[ancient Greek]] of the word "tragedy" (τραγῳδία):&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, ''Poetics'', 1449b&lt;/ref&gt;

"Ἔστιν οὖν τραγῳδία μίμησις πράξεως σπουδαίας καὶ τελείας μέγεθος ἐχούσης, ἡδυσμένῳ λόγῳ χωρὶς ἑκάστῳ τῶν εἰδῶν ἐν τοῖς μορίοις, δρώντων καὶ οὐ δι᾽ ἀπαγγελίας, δι᾽ ἐλέου καὶ φόβου περαίνουσα τὴν τῶν τοιούτων παθημάτων κάθαρσιν."

which means ''Tragedy is an imitation of an action that is admirable, complete (composed of an introduction, a middle part and an ending), and possesses magnitude; in language made pleasurable, each of its species separated in different parts; performed by actors, not through narration; effecting through pity and fear the purification of such emotions.''

Common usage of tragedy refers to any story with a sad ending, whereas to be an [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] tragedy the [[narrative|story]] must fit the set of requirements as laid out by ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''.  By this definition social drama cannot be tragic because the hero in it is a victim of circumstance and incidents that depend upon the society in which he lives and not upon the inner compulsions — psychological or religious — which determine his progress towards self-knowledge and death.&lt;ref&gt;Chiari, J. ''Landmarks of Contemporary Drama''. [[London]]: [[Jenkins (publisher)|Jenkins]], 1965. Page 41.&lt;/ref&gt;  Exactly what constitutes a "tragedy", however, is a frequently debated matter.

According to Aristotle, there are four species of tragedy:

1. Complex, which involves [[Peripety]] and [[Discovery (fiction)|Discovery]]

2. Suffering, tragedies of such nature can be seen in the Greek mythological stories of Ajaxes and Ixions

3. Character, a tragedy of moral or ethical character. Tragedies of this nature can be found in Phthiotides and [[Peleus]]

4. Spectacle, that of a horror-like theme. Examples of this nature are [[Graeae|Phorcides]] and [[Prometheus]]

===Hegel===
[[G.W.F. Hegel]], the German philosopher most famous for his dialectical approach to [[epistemology]] and history, also applied such a methodology to his theory of tragedy. In his essay "Hegel's Theory of Tragedy," [[A.C. Bradley]] first introduced the English-speaking world to Hegel's theory, which Bradley called the "[[tragic collision]]", and contrasted against the Aristotelian notions of the "[[tragic hero]]" and his or her "hamartia" in subsequent analyses of the Aeschylus' Oresteia trilogy and of Sophocles' Antigone.{{Sfn | Bradley | 2007 | pp = 114–56}} Hegel himself, however, in his seminal "[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]" argues for a more complicated theory of tragedy, with two complementary branches which, though driven by a single dialectical principle, differentiate Greek tragedy from that which follows Shakespeare. His later lectures formulate such a theory of tragedy as a conflict of ethical forces, represented by characters, in ancient Greek tragedy, but in Shakespearean tragedy the conflict is rendered as one of subject and object, of individual personality which must manifest self-destructive passions because only such passions are strong enough to defend the individual from a hostile and capricious external world:
{{Quote |The heroes of ancient classical tragedy encounter situations in which, if they firmly decide in favor of the one ethical pathos that alone suits their finished character, they must necessarily come into conflict with the equally [''gleichberechtigt''] justified ethical power that confronts them. Modern characters, on the other hand, stand in a wealth of more accidental circumstances, within which one could act this way or that, so that the conflict is, though occasioned by external preconditions, still essentially grounded in the character. The new individuals, in their passions, obey their own nature... simply because they are what they are. Greek heroes also act in accordance with individuality, but in ancient tragedy such individuality is necessarily... a self-contained ethical pathos...  In modern tragedy, however, the character in its peculiarity  decides in accordance with subjective desires... such that congruity of character with outward ethical aim no longer constitutes an essential basis of tragic beauty...{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | pp = 567–8}}}}

Hegel's comments on a particular play may better elucidate his theory: "Viewed externally, Hamlet's death may be seen to have been brought about accidentally... but in Hamlet's soul, we understand that death has lurked from the beginning: the sandbank of finitude cannot suffice his sorrow and tenderness, such grief and nausea at all conditions of life... we feel he is a man whom inner disgust has almost consumed well before death comes upon him from outside."{{Sfn | Hegel | 1927 | p = 572}}

==Similar dramatic forms in world theatre==
===Ancient Indian drama===
The writer [[Bharata Muni]], in his work on [[dramatic theory]] ''[[Natya Shastra|A Treatise on Theatre]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]: ''Nātyaśāstra'', नाट्य शास्त्र, c. 200 BCE – 200 CE),{{Sfn | Banham | 1998 | p = 517}} identified several ''[[Rasa (art)|rasas]]'' (such as pity, anger, disgust and terror) in the emotional responses of audiences for the [[Sanskrit drama]] of [[History of India|ancient India]]. The text also suggests the notion of [[musical mode]]s or jatis which are the origin of the notion of the modern melodic structures known as [[raga]]s. Their role in invoking emotions are emphasised; thus compositions emphasising the notes [[gandhara]] or [[rishabha]] are said to provoke "sadness" or "pathos" (''karuna rasa'') whereas [[rishabha]] evokes heroism (''vira rasa''). Jatis are elaborated in greater detail in the text ''[[Dattilam]]'', composed around the same time as the ''Treatise''.

The celebrated ancient [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]], ''[[Mahabharata]]'', can also be related to tragedy in some ways.  According to [[Hermann Oldenberg]], the original epic once carried an immense "tragic force".&lt;ref name = Oldenberg&gt;{{Citation | first = Hermann | last = Oldenberg | author-link = Hermann Oldenberg | year = 1922 | title = Das Mahabharata | place = Göttingen}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was common in Sanskrit drama to adapt episodes from the ''Mahabharata'' into dramatic form.

The '''School of Mathematics and Statistics''' is a constituent body of the [[Sydney Faculty of Science|Faculty of Science]] at the [[University of Sydney]], [[Australia]]. It was established in its present form in 1991.

As of December 2010, the Head of School is Professor Neville Weber and the Deputy Head of School is Associate Professor David Easdown.&lt;ref name="about_school"&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Magma computer algebra system]] is produced and distributed by the Computational Algebra Group within the School.

==History==
Mathematics has been taught at the University since its establishment. The first Professor of Mathematics was [[Morris Birkbeck Pell|Morris Pell]], one of the University's three foundation professors. Pell gave the first lecture in mathematics on 13 October 1852, two days after the University's inauguration, to all 24 students at the time. At least two years of mathematics were still required of all the University's students at the time of Pell's retirement in 1877.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School of Mathematics and Statistics was established on 1 January 1991 with the merging of the departments of Applied Mathematics, Pure Mathematics, and Mathematical Statistics.&lt;ref name="about_school" /&gt;

The School is located in the Carslaw Building, which was completed in the early 1960s, and is named after mathematician [[Horatio Scott Carslaw|Horatio Carslaw]] (1870-1954), who was once Professor of Mathematics at the University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/About/Carslaw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Auguste Puttemans Isis 2.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Isis as a veiled "goddess of life" with the Sais inscription written in French on the pedestal beneath her, at the [[Herbert Hoover National Historic Site]]]]
The '''veil of Isis''' is a metaphor and [[allegorical]] [[motif (visual arts)|artistic motif]] in which [[nature]] is personified as the [[goddess]] [[Isis]] covered by a [[veil]] or [[mantle (clothing)|mantle]], representing the inaccessibility of nature's secrets. It is often combined with a related motif, in which nature is portrayed as a goddess with multiple breasts who represents Isis, [[Artemis]], or a combination of both.

The motif was based on a statue of Isis, or of the goddess [[Neith]] who was sometimes equated with her, in the [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] city of [[Sais]] mentioned by the Greco-Roman authors [[Plutarch]] and [[Proclus]]. They claimed the statue bore an inscription saying "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever lifted my mantle." Illustrations of Isis with her veil being lifted were popular from the late 17th to the early 19th century, often as allegorical representations of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] science and philosophy uncovering nature's secrets. Authors at the end of the 18th century, foreshadowing the [[Romantic movement]], began using the lifting of Isis's veil as a metaphor for revealing awe-inspiring truth. [[Helena Blavatsky]], in ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'' in 1877, used the metaphor for the spiritual truths that her [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] belief system hoped to discover, and modern [[ceremonial magic]] includes a ritual called the '''Rending of the Veil''' to bring the magician to a higher state of spiritual awareness.

==The statue and inscription at Sais==
The first mention of the veil of Isis appears in ''On Isis and Osiris'', a philosophical interpretation of [[ancient Egyptian religion]] by [[Plutarch]], a Greek writer in the late first and early second centuries CE. He wrote of a seated statue of a goddess in the Egyptian city of [[Sais]] that bore the inscription "I am all that has been and is and shall be; and no mortal has ever lifted my garment."&lt;ref name="Griffiths 131"&gt;Griffiths 1970, p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch called the garment a ''[[peplos]]''; the word is translated in English as "mantle" or "veil".&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt; Plutarch identified the goddess as "Athena, whom [the Egyptians] consider to be Isis."&lt;ref name="Griffiths 131"/&gt; Sais was the cult center of the goddess [[Neith]], whom the Greeks [[interpretatio graeca|compared]] to their goddess [[Athena]] and was thus the goddess that Plutarch spoke of. In Plutarch's time [[Isis]] was the preeminent goddess in Egyptian religion and was frequently [[ancient Egyptian deities#Manifestations and combinations|syncretized]] with Neith, which is why Plutarch equated the two.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 1970, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; More than 300 years after Plutarch, the [[Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Proclus]] wrote of the same statue in Book I of his ''Commentaries on Plato's "Timaeus"''. In this version, the garment is a ''[[chiton (costume)|chiton]]'', "no mortal" is replaced by "no one", and a third statement is added: "The fruit of my womb was the sun".&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt;

Proclus said the statue was in the ''[[adyton]]'' of a [[Egyptian temple|temple]] at Sais, but the inner areas of Egyptian temples were not accessible to anyone but priests, and it is unlikely that a statue of a deity would have been permanently veiled; priests saw the [[cult image]] of the god every day when performing temple rites. However, a statue in a temple's courtyards or halls could have borne an inscription similar to the one Plutarch and Proclus related.&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt; The first part of the inscription—"I am all that has been and is and shall be"—means the goddess encompasses everything. This claim was commonly made of [[creator god]]s such as [[Ra]] or [[Amun]] in Egyptian religion; if the same was said about Isis, it reflected her increased status in Greco-Roman times, in which she was often said to be the creator of the world. The second part—"no one has ever lifted my mantle"—implies that the goddess was [[virgin]]al, a claim that was occasionally made of Isis in Greco-Roman times but conflicted with the long-standing belief that she and her husband [[Osiris]] conceived their son [[Horus]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths 1970, pp. 284–285&lt;/ref&gt; Proclus's version suggests that the goddess conceived and gave birth to the sun without the participation of a male deity, which would reflect Egyptian myths about Neith as the mother of the sun god Ra. Another possible explanation, suggested by the Egyptologist [[Jan Assmann]], is that the latter part of the Egyptian inscription said "There is nobody except me", proclaiming that the all-encompassing goddess was unique, and was mistranslated into Greek as "there is nobody who opened [or: uncovered] my face."&lt;ref name="Assmann 118"/&gt;

==Isis and Artemis as nature==
[[File:Anatome Animalium frontispiece.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Science unveiling Nature in the frontispiece to ''Anatome Animalum'', 1681]]
Several other sources influenced the motif of the veiled Isis. One was a tradition that linked Isis with [[nature]] and the goddess [[Artemis]]. [[European art]] has a long tradition of personifying nature as a [[Mother Nature|motherly figure]]. Starting in the 16th century, this motif was influenced by the iconography of the goddess [[Temple of Artemis#Ephesian Artemis|Artemis of Ephesus]] (also known under the name of her [[Roman gods|Roman]] equivalent, [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]]). The Ephesian Artemis was depicted with round protuberances on her chest that may originally have been jewelry but came to be interpreted as breasts. Isis was sometimes compared with Artemis, and the Roman writer [[Macrobius]], in the fourth century CE, wrote, "Isis is the earth or nature that is under the sun. That is why the goddess's entire body bristles with a multitude of breasts placed close to one another [as in the case of Artemis of Ephesus], because all things are nourished by earth or by nature." Thus, the 16th-century artists represented nature as Isis-Artemis with multiple breasts.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 233–238&lt;/ref&gt;

A second influence was a tradition that nature is mysterious. It goes back to an aphorism by the Greek philosopher [[Heraclitus]] in the late sixth or early fifth century BCE, which is traditionally translated as "Nature loves to hide." [[Edmund Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' in the 1590s personified nature as a woman with a veil, though without a direct connection to Isis,&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; although Isis appears elsewhere in the work.&lt;ref&gt;Quentin 2012, pp. 145–146&lt;/ref&gt; Several illustrators in the 17th century used the anonymous woman with a veil in the same way. In the 1650s, [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' explicitly explained Isis's veil as an emblem of the secrets of nature.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 237, 240–242&lt;/ref&gt;

The frontispiece to [[Gerhard Blasius]]'s 1681 book ''Anatome Animalum'', engraved by [[Jan Luyken]], was the first depiction of a many-breasted Isis-Artemis figure with her veil being removed. It shows a personification of science removing the veil, as an allegory for the way science uncovers nature's secrets. This metaphor was reused in the frontispieces of many of [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]]'s works, and then in illustrations to other scientific works throughout the 18th century. In some cases the veiled figure is a statue, reminiscent of the original statue of Artemis at Ephesus, while in others it is a living woman. The motif was sometimes elaborated with other metaphors, so that, for example, in the frontispiece to ''The Philosophy of Nature'' by [[Jean-Baptiste-Claude Delisle de Sales]], Nature unveils herself to a philosopher as he overthrows Despotism and Superstition. The unveiling of the Isis-figure thus expressed the hope, prevalent during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], that philosophy and science would triumph over unreason to uncover nature's deepest truths. This motif continued beyond the Enlightenment into the 19th century. An example is [[Louis-Ernest Barrias]]'s 1899 sculpture ''[[Nature Unveiling Herself Before Science]]'', in which the multiple breasts are omitted and the Isis-figure wears a [[scarab (artifact)|scarab]] on her gown that hints at her Egyptian background.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 1, 237–243&lt;/ref&gt;

==Isis as a mystery==
[[File:Frontispiece to The Temple of Nature.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The unveiling of a statue of Isis as a personification of nature, depicted as the climactic moment of an Isiac initiation, in an 1803 engraving by [[Henry Fuseli]]&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 134–135&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Another interpretation of Isis's veil emerged in the late 18th century, in keeping with the [[Romantic movement]] that was developing at the time, in which nature constitutes an awe-inspiring mystery rather than prosaic knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2006, pp. 318–319&lt;/ref&gt;

This interpretation was influenced by the ancient [[mysteries of Isis|mystery initiations dedicated to Isis]] that were performed in the Greco-Roman world.&lt;ref name="Assmann 126"&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 126–134&lt;/ref&gt; Although these rites were developed in [[Hellenistic]] or Roman times, under the influence of earlier [[Greco-Roman mysteries|Greco-Roman mystery rites]],&lt;ref&gt;Bremmer 2014, pp. 110–114&lt;/ref&gt; both classical authors and 18th-century scholars assumed them to have been age-old features of ancient Egyptian religion.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson 2004, pp. 241–245&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[Freemasons]], members of a European [[fraternal organization]] that attained its modern form in the early 18th century, adopted Egyptian motifs and came to believe their rituals could be traced back to the mysteries of Isis.&lt;ref&gt;Macpherson 2004, pp. 245–248&lt;/ref&gt; One Freemason in the 1780s, [[Karl Leonhard Reinhold]], tried to reconcile [[Masonic ritual and symbolism#Symbols in ritual|Freemasonry's traditional origin story]], which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel, with its enthusiasm for Egyptian themes. To do so, he interpreted the first statement on the statue at Sais, "I am all that has been and is and shall be," as a declaration of [[pantheism]], in which nature and divinity are identical. Reinhold claimed the public face of Egyptian religion was [[polytheistic]], but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal the deeper, pantheistic truth to elite initiates. He also said the statement "[[I am that I am]]", spoken by the [[God in Judaism|Jewish God]] in the [[Book of Exodus]], meant the same as the Saite inscription and indicated that [[Judaism]] was a descendant of the ancient Egyptian belief system.&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, pp. 115–125&lt;/ref&gt; Under the influence of Reinhold's interpretation, other Freemasons came to see the veiled Isis as a symbol of an impenetrable enigma, representing [[truth]] and [[being]] as well as nature,&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2004, pp. 267–269&lt;/ref&gt; a deity that, as Assmann puts it, was regarded as "too all-encompassing to have a name."&lt;ref&gt;Assmann 1997, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] connected the motif of Isis's veil with his concept of the [[sublime (philosophy)|sublime]], saying, "Perhaps no one has said anything more sublime, or expressed a thought more sublimely, than in that inscription on the temple of Isis (Mother Nature)." According to Kant, the sublime evoked both wonder and terror, and these emotions appeared frequently in the works of late 18th and early 19th-century authors using the motif of the veil. The ecstatic nature of ancient mystery rites themselves contributed to the focus on emotions.&lt;ref&gt;Hadot 2004, pp. 269–283&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friedrich Schiller]], for instance, wrote an essay on Egyptian and Jewish religion that mostly copied Reinhold's work but put a new emphasis on the emotional buildup that surrounded the mysteries. He said it prepared the initiate to confront the awe-inspiring power of nature at the climax of the rite. Similarly, a frontispiece by [[Henry Fuseli]], made for [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s poem ''The Temple of Nature'' in 1803, explicitly shows the unveiling of a statue of Isis as the climax of the initiation.&lt;ref name="Assmann 126"/&gt;

[[Helena Blavatsky]]'s 1877 book ''[[Isis Unveiled]]'', one of the foundational texts for the [[Western esoteric tradition|esoteric]] belief system of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], used the metaphor of the veil as its title. Isis is not prominent in the book, but in it Blavatsky said that philosophers try to lift the veil of Isis, or nature, but see only her physical forms. She added, "The soul within escapes their view; and the Divine Mother has no answer for them," implying that theosophy will reveal truths about nature that science and philosophy cannot.&lt;ref&gt;Ziolkowski 2008, pp. 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parting of the Veil==
The "Parting of the Veil", "Piercing of the Veil", "Rending of the Veil" or "Lifting of the Veil" refers, in the [[Western mystery tradition]] and [[contemporary witchcraft]], to opening the "veil" of matter, thus gaining entry to a state of spiritual awareness in which the mysteries of nature are revealed. In [[ceremonial magic]], the Sign of the Rending of the Veil is a symbolic gesture performed by the magician with the intention of creating such an opening. It is performed starting with the arms extended forwards and hands flat against each other (either palm to palm or back to back), then spreading the hands apart with a rending motion until the arms point out to both sides and the body is in a T shape. After the working is complete, the magician will typically perform the corresponding Sign of the Closing of the Veil, which has the same movements in reverse.&lt;ref&gt;Greer 1997, pp. 51–53, 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers and users of these models, the decision makers using information obtained from the results of these models, and the individuals affected by decisions based on such models are all rightly concerned with whether a model and its results are "correct".&lt;ref name ="Sargent"&gt;Sargent, Robert G. [http://www.informs-sim.org/wsc11papers/016.pdf "VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION OF SIMULATION MODELS"]. Proceedings of the 2011 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; This concern is addressed through verification and validation of the simulation model.

Simulation models are approximate imitations of real-world systems and they never exactly imitate the real-world system.  Due to that, a model should be verified and validated to the degree needed for the models intended purpose or application.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

The verification and validation of simulation model starts after functional specifications have been documented and initial model development has been completed.&lt;ref name ="Carson" &gt;Carson, John, [http://informs-sim.org/wsc02papers/008.pdf "MODEL VERIFICATION AND VALIDATION"]. Proceedings of the 2002 Winter Simulation Conference.&lt;/ref&gt; Verification and validation is an iterative process that takes place throughout the development of a model.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;

== Verification ==
In the context of computer simulation, '''verification''' of a model is the process of confirming that it is correctly implemented with respect to the conceptual model (it matches specifications and assumptions deemed acceptable for the given purpose of application).&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
During verification the model is tested to find and fix errors in the implementation of the model.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt;
Various processes and techniques are used to assure the model matches specifications and assumptions with respect to the model concept. 
The objective of model verification is to ensure that the implementation of the model is correct.

There are many techniques that can be utilized to verify a model.
Including, but not limited to, have the model checked by an expert, making logic flow diagrams that include each logically possible action, examining the model output for reasonableness under a variety of settings of the input parameters, and using an interactive debugger.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;
Many software engineering techniques used for [[software verification]] are applicable to simulation model verification.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

== Validation ==
Validation checks the accuracy of the model's representation of the real system.  Model validation is defined to mean "substantiation that a computerized model within its domain of applicability possesses a satisfactory range of accuracy consistent with the intended application of the model".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; A model should be built for a specific purpose or set of objectives and its validity determined for that purpose.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

There are many approaches that can be used to validate a computer model.  The approaches range from subjective reviews to objective statistical tests.  One approach that is commonly used is to have the model builders determine validity of the model through a series of tests.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

Naylor and Finger [1967] formulated a three-step approach to model validation that has been widely followed:&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;

Step 1. Build a model that has high face validity.

Step 2. Validate model assumptions.

Step 3. Compare the model input-output transformations to corresponding input-output transformations for the real system.&lt;ref&gt;NAYLOR, T. H., AND J. M.

A model that has '''face validity''' appears to be a reasonable imitation of a real-world system to people who are knowledgeable of the real world system.&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Face validity is tested by having users and people knowledgeable with the system examine model output for reasonableness and in the process identify deficiencies.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; An added advantage of having the users involved in validation is that the model's credibility to the users and the user's confidence in the model increases.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Carson" /&gt; Sensitivity to model inputs can also be used to judge face validity.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if a simulation of a fast food restaurant drive through was run twice with customer arrival rates of 20 per hour and 40 per hour then model outputs such as average wait time or maximum number of customers waiting would be expected to increase with the arrival rate.

=== Validation of model assumptions ===
Assumptions made about a model generally fall into two categories: structural assumptions about how system works and data assumptions.

==== Structural assumptions ====
Assumptions made about how the system operates and how it is physically arranged are structural assumptions.  For example, the number of servers in a fast food drive through lane and if there is more than one how are they utilized?  Do the servers work in parallel where a customer completes a transaction by visiting a single server or does one server take orders and handle payment while the other prepares and serves the order.  Many structural problems in the model come from poor or incorrect assumptions.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  If possible the workings of the actual system should be closely observed to understand how it operates.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  The systems structure and operation should also be verified with users of the actual system.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;

==== Data assumptions ====
There must be a sufficient amount of appropriate data available to build a conceptual model and validate a model.  Lack of appropriate data is often the reason attempts to validate a model fail.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;  Data should be verified to come from a reliable source.  A typical error is assuming an inappropriate statistical distribution for the data.&lt;ref name="Banks" /&gt;  The assumed statistical model should be tested using goodness of fit tests and other techniques.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; Examples of goodness of fit tests are the [[Kolmogorov–Smirnov test]] and the [[chi-square test]].  Any outliers in the data should be checked.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

=== Validating input-output transformations ===
The model is viewed as an input-output transformation for these tests.  The validation test consists of comparing outputs from the system under consideration to model outputs for the same set of input conditions.  Data recorded while observing the system must be available in order to perform this test.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The model output that is of primary interest should be used as the measure of performance.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if system under consideration is a fast food drive through where input to model is customer arrival time and the output measure of performance is average customer time in line, then the actual arrival time and time spent in line for customers at the drive through would be recorded.  The model would be run with the actual arrival times and the model average time in line would be compared with the actual average time spent in line using one or more tests.

==== Hypothesis testing ====
[[Statistical hypothesis testing]] using the [[Student's t-test|t-test]] can be used as a basis to accept the model as valid or reject it as invalid.

The hypothesis to be tested is
:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance = the system measure of performance
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; the model measure of performance ≠ the system measure of performance.

The test is conducted for a given sample size and level of significance or α.  To perform the test a number ''n'' statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and an average or expected value, E(Y), for the variable of interest is produced.  Then the test statistic, ''t''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is computed for the given α, ''n'', E(Y) and the observed value for the system  μ&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;t_0 = {(E(Y)-u_0)}/{(S/\sqrt{n})}&lt;/math&gt; and the critical value for α and n-1 the degrees of freedom

: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt; is calculated.

If 
: &lt;math&gt; \left\vert t_0 \right\vert &gt; t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
reject H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, the model needs adjustment.

There are two types of error that can occur using hypothesis testing, rejecting a valid model called type I error or "model builders risk" and accepting an invalid model called Type II error, β, or "model user's risk".&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The level of significance or α is equal the probability of type I error.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; If α is small then rejecting the null hypothesis is a strong conclusion.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; For example, if α = 0.05 and the null hypothesis is rejected there is only a 0.05 probability of rejecting a model that is valid.  Decreasing the probability of a type II error is very important.&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt;&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt; The probability of correctly detecting an invalid model is 1 - β.  The probability of a type II error is dependent of the sample size and the actual difference between the sample value and the observed value.  Increasing the sample size decreases the risk of a type II error.

===== Model accuracy as a range =====
A statistical technique where the amount of model accuracy is specified as a range has recently been developed.  The technique uses hypothesis testing to accept a model if the difference between a model's variable of interest and a system's variable of interest is within a specified range of accuracy.&lt;ref name="Sargent2"&gt;Sargent, R. G. 2010. "A New Statistical Procedure for Validation of Simulation and Stochastic Models." Technical Report SYR-EECS-2010-06, Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement is that both the system data and model data be approximately [[Normal distribution|Normally]] [[Independent and identically distributed random variables|Independent and Identically Distributed (NIID)]].  The [[Student's t-test|t-test]] statistic is used in this technique.  If the mean of the model is μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; and the mean of system is μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt; then the difference between the model and the system is D = μ&lt;sup&gt;m&lt;/sup&gt; - μ&lt;sup&gt;s&lt;/sup&gt;.  The hypothesis to be tested is if D is within the acceptable range of accuracy. Let L = the lower limit for accuracy and U = upper limit for accuracy.  Then

:H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; L ≤ D ≤ U
versus
:H&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; D &lt; L or D &gt; U

is to be tested.

The operating characteristic (OC) curve is the probability that the null hypothesis is accepted when it is true.  The OC curve characterizes the probabilities of both type I and II errors.  Risk curves for model builder's risk and model user's can be developed from the OC curves.  Comparing curves with fixed sample size tradeoffs between model builder's risk and model user's risk can be seen easily in the risk curves.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt; If model builder's risk, model user's risk, and the upper and lower limits for the range of accuracy are all specified then the sample size needed can be calculated.&lt;ref name="Sargent2" /&gt;

==== Confidence intervals ====
Confidence intervals can be used to evaluate if a model is "close enough"&lt;ref name ="Banks" /&gt; to a system for some variable of interest.  The difference between the known model value, μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and the system value, μ, is checked to see if it is less than a value small enough that the model is valid with respect that variable of interest.  The value is denoted by the symbol ε.  To perform the test a number, ''n'', statistically independent runs of the model are conducted and a mean or expected value, E(Y) or μ for simulation output variable of interest Y, with a standard deviation ''S'' is produced.  A confidence level is selected, 100(1-α).  An interval, [a,b], is constructed by

: &lt;math&gt;a = E(Y) - t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n} \qquad and \qquad b = E(Y) + t_{a/2,n-1}S/\sqrt{n}&lt;/math&gt;,
where 
: &lt;math&gt;t_{a/2,n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
is the critical value from the t-distribution for the given level of significance and n-1 degrees of freedom.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε then the model needs to be calibrated since in both cases the difference is larger than acceptable.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε then the model is acceptable as in both cases the error is close enough.
: If |a-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &lt; ε and |b-μ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;| &gt; ε or [[vice versa]] then additional runs of the model are needed to shrink the interval.

==== Graphical comparisons ====
If statistical assumptions cannot be satisfied or there is insufficient data for the system a graphical comparisons of model outputs to system outputs can be used to make a subjective decisions, however other objective tests are preferable.&lt;ref name ="Sargent" /&gt;

'''''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia''''' is an [[anthropology|anthropological]] study of the [[Wicca]]n and wider [[Paganism (contemporary)|Pagan]] community in Australia. It was written by the Australian anthropologist Lynne Hume and first published in 1997 by [[Melbourne University Press]].

Hume first encountered the Pagan movement in Canada, before beginning to explore Pagan groups in her native Australia.

==Background==

===Academic fieldwork into Paganism===

Prior to Magliocco's work, multiple American researchers working in the field of [[Pagan studies]] had separately published investigations of the Pagan community in both the United States and the United Kingdom. The first of these had been the practising Wiccan, journalist and political activist [[Margot Adler]] in her ''[[Drawing Down the Moon (book)|Drawing Down the Moon: Witches, Druids, Goddess-Worshippers, and Other Pagans in America Today]]'', which was first published by [[Viking Press]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Adl79|Adler 1979]].&lt;/ref&gt; A second study was produced by the anthropologist [[Tanya Luhrmann|Tanya M. Luhrmann]] in her ''Persuasions of the Witches' Craft: Ritual Magic in Contemporary England'' (1989), in which she focused on both a Wiccan coven and several ceremonial magic orders that were then operating in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Luh89|Luhrmann 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the sociologist Loretta Orion's ''[[Never Again the Burning Times|Never Again the Burning Times: Paganism Revisited]]'' (1995), which focused on Pagan communities on the American East Coast and Midwest.{{sfn|Orion|1995}}

===Hume and her research===
Lynne Hume had been born and raised into the Christian faith but maintained an interest in non-Christian beliefs and societies, becoming a [[religious pluralism|religious pluralist]] and leading her to study the discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume was introduced to the Pagan movement while in Canada during the early 1990s. Attending a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] church in [[Calgary]], it was here that a group of Wiccans had been invited to give a talk on their magico-religious practices during a Sunday morning service. Intrigued, she joined two separate Wiccan covens; one, known as the Daughters of the Moon, was exclusively for women, while the other was a mixed gender group. She remained in these groups for a year before returning to Australia in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 2&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt; Back in her homeland, she began looking for Pagan groups here as well, encountering several Pagan individuals in Queensland before attending the second annual Pagan Summer Gathering (PSG), which was organised by the [[Church of All Worlds]] and held in the rural outskirts of [[Canberra]]. Although knowing nobody at the festival, she took part in the rituals which took place over the next five days, including a [[neoshamanism|neoshamanic]] meditation, an runic women's rite, a tree planting ceremony and a [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]]-inspired ritual devoted to the goddess [[Oya]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;6.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box|width=25em|align=left|bgcolor=#ACE1AF|quote="In publishing this book, I hope that I can dispel some of the fear surrounding the topic and convey a more accurate picture of this little-known movement in Australia."|source=—Lynne Hume, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

In preparation for ''Witchcraft and Paganism in Australia'', Hume spent five years among the Pagan community in both Canada and Australia, attending both private and public events including Sabbat festivals, workshops and conferences. She visited Wiccan covens in [[Western Australia]], [[South Australia]], [[New South Wales]] and Queensland, interviewing people both informally and formally. Immersing herself in the movement, she made many Pagan friends, noting that it became "not only a research project, but a highly enjoyable pastime." Alongside her active participation, Hume also made a study of most of the available literature on the subject, subscribing to Pagan newsletters and researching in the archives of the Canberra Occult Reference Centre, [[Murdoch University]] and at the [[Theosophical Society]] in [[Brisbane]]. She also sent out questionnaires through various Pagan newsletters and gatherings, attaining responses through a [[snowball sampling]] method.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hum97|Hume 1997]]. pp. 14&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Chapter one, entitled "Doing is Knowing: Introduction and Approach", begins with an introduction to the new religious movement of contemporary Paganism. This is followed by Hume's discussion of how she first encountered and came to study the Pagan movement, while the chapter is then rounded off with a discussion of the anthropological methodology that she adopted in her investigation.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=1&amp;ndash;15}} The second chapter offers a brief historical outline of the Pagan and Wiccan movements, and their arrival in Australia.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=16&amp;ndash;40}} The third looks at commonly held beliefs in the Pagan community, such as their moral values, their respect for nature, and their cosmological views,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=41&amp;ndash;78}} while the fourth examines the organisation and structure of the movement, looking at how individuals and embrace and convert to it, and how Wiccan covens operate.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=79&amp;ndash;111}}

Chapter five offers an examination of [[rites of passage]] and the process of ritual in Paganism and Wicca,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=112&amp;ndash;143}} while the sixth looks at Pagan belief in [[magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=144&amp;ndash;168}} The following chapter discusses Pagan experiental and emotional experiences and beliefs regarding other realms,{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=169&amp;ndash;204}} and the eighth looks at morality and ethics in the movement alongside its relation with legality.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=205&amp;ndash;225}} In her conclusion, Hume discusses the movement's attraction for those with feminist and environmentalist attitudes.{{sfn|Hume|1997|pp=226&amp;ndash;238}}

==Reviews==
Emma Tomalin of [[Lancaster University]] reviewed the work for ''[[Nova Religio|Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions]]''. Tomalin notes that Hume did not look specifically at the uniquely Australian features of contemporary Paganism, and tends toward being "descriptive rather than discursive", thereby appealing more to those "interested in an overview of contemporary Pagan belief and practice
than those who wish to explore its wider political or social implications."{{sfn|Tomalin|1999|pp=174&amp;ndash;175}}
