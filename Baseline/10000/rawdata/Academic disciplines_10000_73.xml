'''Agricultural engineering''' is the [[engineering]] discipline that studies [[agriculture|agricultural]] production and processing. Agricultural engineering combines the disciplines of [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]] and [[chemical engineering|chemical]] engineering principles with a knowledge of agricultural principles according to technological principles. A key goal of this discipline is to improve the efficacy and sustainability of agricultural practices.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asabe.org/|title=ASABE|website=www.asabe.org|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the leading organizations in this industry is the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineering]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== ASABE standards ==
The ASABE provides safety and regulatory standards for the agricultural industry. These [http://www.asabe.org/standards/asabe-international-standards-activities.aspx#tabBody2177 standards] and regulations are developed on an international scale and include topics on fertilizers, soil conditions, fisheries, biofuels, biogass, feed machinery, tractors, and machinery.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Specialties==
Agricultural engineers may engage in any of the following areas: 
* design of [[agricultural machinery]], equipment, and agricultural [[structures]]
* [[internal combustion engines]] as applied to agricultural machinery
* agricultural resource management (including [[land use]] and [[water use]])
* water management, conservation, and storage for crop [[irrigation]] and [[livestock]] production
* [[surveying]] and land profiling
* [[climatology]] and [[atmospheric science]]
* [[soil]] management and conservation, including [[erosion]] and erosion control
* [[seed]]ing, [[tillage]], [[harvesting]], and [[Process (engineering)|processing]] of [[crop]]s
* [[livestock]] production, including [[poultry]], [[aquaculture|fish]], and [[dairy]] animals
* [[waste management]], including animal waste, agricultural residues, and fertilizer runoff
* [[food engineering]] and the processing of agricultural products
* basic principles of [[circuit analysis]], as applied to electrical motors
* physical and chemical properties of materials used in, or produced by, agricultural production
* [[bioresource engineering]], which uses machines on the molecular level to help the environment.
* [[Design of experiments]] related to crop and animal production

== History ==
The first curriculum in agricultural engineering was established at [[Iowa State University]] by Professor J. B. Davidson in 1903. The American Society of Agricultural Engineers, now known as the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]], was founded in 1907.&lt;ref&gt;

== Agricultural engineers ==

Agricultural engineers may perform tasks such as planning, supervising and managing the building of dairy effluent schemes, [[irrigation]], [[drainage]], [[flood]] water control systems, performing [[environmental impact assessment]]s, [[agricultural]] [[Product (business)|product]] [[Process (engineering)|processing]] and interpret research results and implement relevant practices. A large percentage of agricultural engineers work in academia or for government agencies such as the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] or state [[agricultural extension]] services.  Some are consultants, employed by private engineering firms, while others work in industry, for manufacturers of agricultural machinery, equipment, processing technology, and structures for housing livestock and storing crops. Agricultural engineers work in production, sales, [[management]], [[research]] and development, or [[applied science]].

In the United Kingdom the term Agricultural Engineer is often also used to describe a person that repairs or modifies agricultural equipment.

==Academic programs in agricultural and bio-systems engineering==
Below is a listing of known academic programs that offer bachelor's degrees (B.S. or B.S.E. or B.E / B.Tech) in what [[ABET]] terms "[[Agricultural Engineering]]", "[[Biological systems engineering|Biosystems Engineering]]", "[[Biological Engineering]]", or similarly named programs. ABET accredits college and university programs in the disciplines of applied science, computing, engineering, and engineering technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3414">The '''Arts and Humanities Data Service''' ('''AHDS''') was a [[United Kingdom]] national service aiding the discovery, creation and preservation of digital resources in and for research, teaching and learning in the [[arts]] and [[humanities]]. It was established in 1996 and ceased operation in 2008 (although the website and related digital collections are still accessible).

Organised via a Managing Executive at [[King's College London]] and five AHDS Centres, hosted by various UK Higher Education Institutions, the AHDS was funded until the end of March 2008 by the [[Joint Information Systems Committee]] and the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] (AHRC).  

However, in March 2007 the AHRC decided to cease funding for the AHDS beyond March 2008. As a result, the AHDS is now advising AHRC applicants to ensure their projects include a budget for the costs of preservation and sustainability (whether with the AHDS or another service).

Following the demise of AHDS, and the cessation of the [[Methods Network]], the [[Centre for e-Research (CeRch)]] was established at [[King's College London]] in 2008. The Centre's aims are to facilitate interdisciplinary, institutional, national and international collaboration.

The five subject-based AHDS Centres are:

*[[AHDS Archaeology]] — [[University of York]]
*[[AHDS History]] — [[University of Essex]]
*[[AHDS Literature, Languages and Linguistics]] — [[Oxford University]]
*[[AHDS Performing Arts]] — [[Humanities Advanced Technology and Information Institute|HATII]] at the [[University of Glasgow]]
*[[AHDS Visual Arts]] — [[University for the Creative Arts]] (Farnham campus)

Specific areas of work that the Arts and Humanities Data Service covers include:

*[[digital preservation]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/ahds-preservation-documents.htm preservation handbooks] detailing specific preservation issues with various digital file formats and information on its [http://ahds.ac.uk/preservation/repository.htm digital repository]
*Advice on [[digitization]] — including a series of [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/case-studies/ case studies] of existing digitization projects, [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/information-papers/ information papers] on specific issues in digitization, and longer [http://ahds.ac.uk/creating/guides Guides to Good Practice] dealing with digitization topics in particular arts and humanities disciplines

The avant-garde pushes the boundaries of what is accepted as the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] or the [[status quo]], primarily in the cultural realm. The avant-garde is considered by some to be a hallmark of [[modernism]], as distinct from [[postmodernism]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}. Many [[artists]] have aligned themselves with the avant-garde movement and still continue to do so, tracing a history from [[Dada]] through [[Situationist International|the Situationists]] to postmodern artists such as the [[Language poets]] around 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ubu.com/ UBU Web] List of artists from Dada to the present day aligning themselves with the avant-garde&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=August 2016}}

The avant-garde also promotes radical social reforms. It was this meaning that was evoked by the [[Saint Simonian]] [[Olinde Rodrigues]] in his essay "L'artiste, le savant et l'industriel" ("The artist, the scientist and the industrialist", 1825), which contains the first recorded use of "avant-garde" in its now customary sense: there, Rodrigues calls on artists to "serve as [the people's] avant-garde", insisting that "the power of the arts is indeed the most immediate and fastest way" to social, political and economic reform.&lt;ref&gt;Matei Calinescu, ''[https://www.dukeupress.edu/five-faces-of-modernity/ The Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-Garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism]'' (Durham: [[Duke University Press]], 1987), {{Page needed|date=May 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

Several writers have attempted to map the parameters of avant-garde activity. The Italian essayist [[Renato Poggioli]] provides one of the earliest analyses of vanguardism as a cultural phenomenon in his 1962 book ''Teoria dell'arte d'avanguardia'' (''The Theory of the Avant-Garde'').&lt;ref&gt;Sascha Bru and Gunther Martens, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=suPzDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21 The Invention of Politics in the European Avant-Garde (1906–1940)]'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2006), p. 21. {{ISBN|9042019093}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying the historical, social, psychological and philosophical aspects of [[vanguardism]], Poggioli reaches beyond individual instances of art, poetry, and music to show that vanguardists may share certain ideals or values which manifest themselves in the non-conformist lifestyles they adopt: He sees  vanguard culture as a variety or subcategory of [[Bohemianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Renato Poggioli|title=The Theory of the Avant-Garde |publisher=Belknap Press of [[Harvard University Press]]| year = 1968 | isbn = 0-674-88216-4 |page=11}}, translated from the Italian by Gerald Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors have attempted both to clarify and to extend Poggioli's study. The [[Germans|German]] literary critic Peter Bürger's ''Theory of the Avant-Garde'' (1974) looks at [[the Establishment]]'s embrace of socially critical works of art and suggests that in complicity with capitalism, "art as an institution neutralizes the political content of the individual work".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Peter Bürger|title=Theorie der Avantgarde|publisher=Suhrkamp Verlag|year=1974}} English translation (University of Minnesota Press) 1984: 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bürger's essay also greatly influenced the work of contemporary American art-historians such as the German [[Benjamin H. D. Buchloh]] (born 1941). Buchloh, in the collection of essays ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry'' (2000) critically argues for a dialectical approach to these positions.&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Buchloh, ''Neo-avantgarde and Culture Industry: Essays on European and American Art from 1955 to 1975'' (Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001) {{ISBN|0-262-02454-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent criticism theorized the limitations of these approaches, noting their circumscribed areas of analysis, including Eurocentric, chauvinist, and genre-specific definitions.&lt;ref&gt;

Harding: ''Cutting Performances: Collage Events, Feminist Artists, and the American Avant-Garde'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 2010): {{Page needed|date=July 2016}}.&lt;!--Page citation needed for the assertion that "subsequent criticism" generally has done this; if Harding's book is a sole example, then the text should be changed to honestly represent this.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to mainstream society==
{{See|Mainstream}}
{{see also|Media culture|Spectacle (critical theory)}}
The concept of avant-garde refers primarily to artists, writers, composers and thinkers whose work is opposed to mainstream cultural values and often has a trenchant social or political edge. Many writers, critics and theorists made assertions about vanguard culture during the formative years of modernism, although the initial definitive statement on the avant-garde was the essay ''[[Avant-Garde and Kitsch]]'' by New York art critic [[Clement Greenberg]], published in ''[[Partisan Review]]'' in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Greenberg |first= Clement|date=Fall 1939 |title=Avant-Garde and Kitsch |url=http://hgar-srv3.bu.edu/collections/partisan-review/search/detail?id=283920 |magazine=The Partisan Review |pages=34-49 |volume=6 |issue=5 |access-date=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenberg argued that vanguard culture has historically been opposed to "high" or "mainstream" culture, and that it has also rejected the artificially synthesized [[mass culture]] that has been produced by industrialization. Each of these media is a direct product of [[Capitalism]]—they are all now substantial industries—and as such they are driven by the same profit-fixated motives of other sectors of manufacturing, not the ideals of true art. For Greenberg, these forms were therefore ''[[kitsch]]'': phony, faked or mechanical culture, which often pretended to be more than they were by using formal devices stolen from vanguard culture. For instance, during the 1930s the advertising industry was quick to take visual mannerisms from [[surrealism]], but this does not mean that 1930s advertising photographs are truly surreal.

[[File:AdornoHorkheimerHabermasbyJeremyJShapiro2.png|thumb|right|[[Max Horkheimer]] (front left), [[Theodor Adorno]] (front right), and [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the background, right, in 1965 at [[Heidelberg]], [[West Germany]].]]

Various members of the [[Frankfurt School]] argued similar views: thus [[Theodor Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] in their essay ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment|The Culture Industry: Enlightenment as Mass-Deception]]'' (1944), and also [[Walter Benjamin]] in his highly influential "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]]" (1935, rev. 1939).&lt;ref&gt;Walter Benjamin, "[http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction]" {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205013822/http://bid.berkeley.edu/bidclass/readings/benjamin.html |date=5 December 2006 }}{{Full citation needed|date=June 2017}}&lt;!--Place, publisher, translator, etc. needed.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Where Greenberg used the German word ''[[kitsch]]'' to describe the antithesis of avant-garde culture, members of the Frankfurt School coined the term "[[mass culture]]" to indicate that this bogus culture is constantly being manufactured by a newly emerged [[culture industry]] (comprising commercial publishing houses, the movie industry, the record industry, and the electronic media).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.sociosite.net/topics/texts/adorno_culture_reconsidered.pdf Theodor W. Adorno (1963)], "[[Culture Industry Reconsidered]]: Selected Essays on Mass Culture", London: Routledge, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; They also pointed out that the rise of this industry meant that artistic excellence was displaced by sales figures as a measure of worth: a novel, for example, was judged meritorious solely on whether it became a best-seller, music succumbed to ratings charts and to the blunt commercial logic of the Gold disc. In this way the autonomous artistic merit so dear to the vanguardist was abandoned and sales increasingly became the measure, and justification, of everything. Consumer culture now ruled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The avant-garde's [[Recuperation (politics)|co-option]] by the global capitalist market, by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] economies, and by what [[Guy Debord]] called ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'', have made contemporary critics speculate on the possibility of a meaningful avant-garde today. Paul Mann's ''Theory-Death of the Avant-Garde'' demonstrates how completely the avant-garde is embedded within institutional structures today, a thought also pursued by [[Richard Schechner]] in his analyses of avant-garde performance.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Schechner, "The Conservative Avant-Garde." ''New Literary History'' 41.4 (Autumn 2010): 895–913.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the central arguments of Greenberg, Adorno and others, various sectors of the mainstream culture industry have co-opted and misapplied the term "avant-garde" since the 1960s, chiefly as a marketing tool to publicise popular music and commercial cinema. It has become common to describe successful rock musicians and celebrated film-makers as "avant-garde", the very word having been stripped of its proper meaning. Noting this important conceptual shift, major contemporary theorists such as [[Matei Calinescu]] in ''Five Faces of Modernity: Modernism, Avant-garde, Decadence, Kitsch, Postmodernism'' (1987),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} and Hans Bertens in ''The Idea of the Postmodern: A History'' (1995),{{page needed|date=September 2012}} have suggested that this is a sign our culture has entered a new [[post-modern]] age, when the former [[modernist]] ways of thinking and behaving have been rendered redundant.&lt;ref&gt;Calinescu 1987,{{page needed|date=September 2012}}; Bertens 1995.{{page needed|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, an incisive critique of vanguardism as against the views of mainstream society was offered by the New York critic [[Harold Rosenberg]] in the late 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Rosenberg, ''The De-Definition of Art: Action Art to Pop to Earthworks'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1983), p. 219 {{ISBN|0-226-72673-8}}. Originally published: New York: Horizon Press, 1972; reprinted New York: Collier Books, 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to strike a balance between the insights of Renato Poggioli and the claims of Clement Greenberg, Rosenberg suggested that from the mid-1960s onward progressive culture ceased to fulfill its former adversarial role. Since then it has been flanked by what he called "avant-garde ghosts to the one side, and a changing mass culture on the other", both of which it interacts with to varying degrees. This has seen culture become, in his words, "a profession one of whose aspects is the pretense of overthrowing it".&lt;ref&gt;George Dickie, "[http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/Arts/Arts-idx?type=turn&amp;id=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2&amp;entity=Arts.ArtsSocv12i2.p0074&amp;isize=text "Symposium on Marxist Aesthetic Thought: Commentary on the Papers by Rudich, San Juan, and Morawski]", ''Arts in Society: Art and Social Experience: Our Changing Outlook on Culture'' 12, no. 2 (Summer–Fall 1975): p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Avant-garde in music can refer to any form of music working within traditional structures while seeking to breach boundaries in some manner.&lt;ref name=iha&gt;David Nicholls (ed.), ''The Cambridge History of American Music'' (Cambridge and New York: [[Cambridge University Press]], 1998), 122–24. {{ISBN|0-521-45429-8}} {{ISBN|978-0-521-54554-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used loosely to describe the work of any musicians who radically depart from tradition altogether.&lt;ref name="Samson"&gt;Jim Samson, "Avant garde", ''The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians'', second edition, edited by [[Stanley Sadie]] and [[John Tyrrell (professor of music)|John Tyrrell]] (London: Macmillan Publishers, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt; By this definition, some avant-garde composers of the 20th century include [[Arnold Schoenberg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Ives]],&lt;ref&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 222. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Igor Stravinsky]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; [[Anton Webern]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), 50. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Antheil]] (in his earliest works only), [[Alban Berg]],&lt;ref name="Sitsky_50" /&gt; [[Henry Cowell]] (in his earliest works), [[Philip Glass]], [[Harry Partch]], [[John Cage]], [[Morton Feldman]], [[Richard Strauss]] (in his earliest work),&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xiii–xiv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]],&lt;ref&gt;Elliot Schwartz, Barney Childs, and James Fox (eds.), ''Contemporary Composers on Contemporary Music'' (New York: Da Capo Press, 1998), 379. {{ISBN|0-306-80819-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edgard Varèse]], and [[Iannis Xenakis]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xiv" /&gt; Although most avant-garde composers have been men, this is not exclusively the case. Women avant-gardists include [[Pauline Oliveros]], [[Diamanda Galás]], [[Meredith Monk]], and [[Laurie Anderson]].&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xvii"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xvii. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another definition of "Avant-gardism" that distinguishes it from "modernism": Peter Bürger, for example, says avant-gardism rejects the "institution of art" and challenges social and artistic values, and so necessarily involves political, social, and cultural factors.&lt;ref name="Samson" /&gt; According to the composer and musicologist [[Larry Sitsky]], modernist composers from the early 20th century who do not qualify as avant-gardists include Arnold Schoenberg, Anton Webern, and Igor Stravinsky; later modernist composers who do not fall into the category of avant-gardists include [[Elliott Carter]], [[Milton Babbitt]], [[György Ligeti]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], and [[Luciano Berio]], since "their modernism was not conceived for the purpose of goading an audience."&lt;ref name="Sitsky_xv"&gt;Larry Sitsky, ''Music of the Twentieth-Century Avant-Garde: A Biocritical Sourcebook'' (Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 2002), xv. {{ISBN|0-313-29689-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
{{Main article|Experimental theatre}}

Whereas the avant-garde has a significant history in 20th-century music, it is more pronounced in theatre and performance art, and often in conjunction with music and sound design innovations, as well as developments in visual media design. There are movements in theatre history that are characterized by their contributions to the avant-garde traditions in both the United States and Europe. Among these are [[Fluxus]], [[Happenings]], and [[Neo-Dada]].

'''Burra Katha''', also spelled Burrakatha, is an [[oral storytelling]] technique in the [[Katha (storytelling format)|Katha]] tradition, performed in villages of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Telangana]]. The troupe consists of one main performer and two co-performers. It is a narrative entertainment that consists of prayers, solo drama, dance, songs, poems and jokes. The topic will be either a [[Hindu]] mythological story ([[Jangam|Jangam Katha]]) or a contemporary social issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Burrakatha loses sheen sans patronage| url = http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-14/visakhapatnam/36332535_1_artistes-burrakatha-art-form |date=Jan 14, 2013| accessdate = 2013-09-02
| publisher = [[The Times of India]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Burra - Katha was developed in Guntur district around 1942 with the aim of propagating political ideas among illiterate masses in villages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4U5AAAAIAAJ|title=Vidya Bharathi|last=Lectures|first=Bangalore University Dept of Publications and Extension|date=1977-01-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The communists with the help of Andhra Praja Natya Mandali founded by Mikkilineni Radhakrishna Murthy in Bezawada spread the message to the masses in the Naizam region during the rebellion against Nizam in the 1940s.

==Etymology==
"Burra" is referred to [[Tanpura|tambura]], a musical string instrument with a hollow shell. "Katha" means story.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Burrakatha.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Burrakatha photo from Vepachedu research foundation]] --&gt;
Burra means a skull in [[Telugu language|Telugu]]. The shell resembles a [[human skull]]. It is made of baked clay or dried pumpkin, or of brass and copper. The instrument looks very similar to [[veena]] and the performer can pull and press strings to get music.

==Alternative names==
Burrakatha refers to the art throughout [[Andhra Pradesh]], and there are local names in each region.
* Coastal region: Tamboora or Jangam or Tandanana Katha
* Rayalaseema: Tamboora or Tandana katha or suddulu
* Telangana: Tamboora or Sarada katha

==History==
Burrakatha started as devotional songs of nomadic people and became a popular art form. It is played on radio and TV regularly in [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is a 20th-century name for the theater show known as [[Jangam]] Katha. The [[jangam|jangams lingayats]] were wandering minstrels who worshiped and sang of [[Shiva|Lord Siva]]. Two performers participated in these plays: the storyteller and his wife. With societal and cultural changes, the secular aspect was incorporated into this form. The modern form has three performers of any gender.

Popular Hindu artists were Pendyala Venkateswarrao, Sunkara Sri Krishna Madhava Rao, Paruchuri Ramakotayya, Sirivisetti Subbarao, Kosuri Punnayya, Govardhana, Kakumanu Subbarao, Davuluru, Chintalal Suryanarayana, Budagajangala mote papaiah, Budagajangala mote kullayappa, Budagajangala mote ramalingam, etc. Women also formed groups, e.g., Moturi Udayam, Chintala Koteswaramma, Mahankali Lakshmi, Sridevi sisters, etc. Popular non-Hindu artists are Abraham Bhagavatar, Manohara Kavi, Khader Khan Sahib, Shaik Nazar etc.

==Modern form==
The main storyteller (kathakudu) narrates the story. He plays tambura and dances to music. He also wears a metal ring called an andelu on his right thumb, holds another ring in his other hand and adds more music by colliding them frequently.  The co-performers plays gummeta (also called dakki or budike), earthen drums with two heads. All three or only the kathakadu wear anklets (also called as gajjelu), which add even more music when they dance.

The right side performer (hasyaka, meaning joker) acts as a joker and cracks satires and jokes. The left side performer (rajakiya, meaning politician) acts as someone who knows worldly ways and talks about politics and social issues. The main performer and co-performers constantly was address each other. The co-performers interrupt the kathakudu with doubts, and they sometimes add emphasis to the main events in the story with short words similar to "Wow!" "Aha!" and "That is it."

Whenever the main performer sings a song, he or she starts with "vinara veera kumara veera gadha vinara" followed by the co-performers singing "tandhana tane tandhana na." It is also called 'tandana katha.'

==Significance==
Burra katha was a pastime event in villages. It is seen even now during [[Navratri|Dussehra]] or [[Sankranti]] festival seasons to describe events in epics like [[Ramayan]] and [[Mahabharat]] and also some of best and moral stories of kings like kambojaraju katha, chinnamma katha, muggurumoratila katha, etc.

It played an effective role in conveying message to people and awakening them during [[Indian Independence Movement]]. Burrakatha was banned in [[Madras]] by the British government and in [[Hyderabad State|Hyderabad]] kingdom by Nizam government, because it was the medium to enlighten the people of the political situation in political meetings.

==Present==
Burrakatha tellers are called as budagajangalu. Internet and movies play a major role in modern life.
That's why the burrakathas are not being seen and no one is there to develop this and improve the art.
In past these burrakatha tellers were important in the villages; now there is no response for their art.

So these burrakatha tellers left their traditional art and have become beggars or day labourers. Even in these modern times, there are no educated people in this tribe. They don't have caste certificates for developing their tribe.

[[Daroji Eramma]] was a performer of Burra katha from [[Karnataka]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3862">'''Business informatics''' ('''BI''') or '''organizational informatics''' is a discipline combining [[information technology]] (IT), [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]] and [[management]] concepts. The BI discipline was created in [[Germany]], from the concept of [[Wirtschaftsinformatik]]. It is an established [[Discipline (academia)|academic discipline]] including [[bachelor]], [[Master's degree|master]], [[IB Diploma Programme|diploma]] and [[PhD]] programs in [[Austria]], [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands|The Netherlands]], [[Russia]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], [[Turkey]] and is establishing in an increasing number of other countries as well as [[Australia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Poland]] or [[Mexico]]. BI integrates core elements from the disciplines of [[business administration]], [[information system]]s and [[computer science]] into one field.

==Business informatics as an integrative discipline==
BI shows similarities to [[information systems]] (IS), which is a well established discipline originating from [[North America]]. However, there are a few differences that make business informatics a unique own discipline:
# Business informatics includes [[information technology]], like the relevant portions of applied [[computer science]], to a larger extent than information systems does.
# Business informatics includes significant construction and implementation oriented elements. I.e. one major focus lies in the development of solutions for business problems rather than the [[ex post]] investigation of their impact.

[[Information systems]] (IS) focuses on empirically explaining phenomena of the real world. IS has been said to have an "explanation-oriented" focus in contrast to the "solution-oriented" focus that dominates BI. IS researchers make an effort to explain phenomena of acceptance and influence of IT in organizations and the society applying an empirical approach. In order to do that usually [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] and quantitative empirical studies are conducted and evaluated. In contrast to that, BI researchers mainly focus on the creation of IT solutions for challenges they have observed or assumed.

Tight integration between research and teaching following the [[Wilhelm von Humboldt|Humboldtian]] ideal is another goal in business informatics. Insights gained in actual research projects become part of the curricula quite fast because most researchers are also lecturers at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vg-u.de |title=Virtual Global University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070303102656/http://www.vg-u.de/ |archivedate=2007-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of scientific and technological progress in BI is quite rapid, therefore subjects taught are under permanent reconsideration and revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Ives, B., J. Valacich, R. Watson, R. Zmud and|title=What Every Business Student Needs to Know About Information Systems|journal=Communications of the Association for Information Systems|volume=9|date=December 2002|url=http://aisel.aisnet.org/cais/vol9/iss1/30/|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its evolution, the BI discipline is fairly young. Therefore, significant hurdles have to be overcome in order to further establish its vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lyytinen, K., R. Baskerville, J. Livari, D. Te'eni|title=Why the old world cannot publish? Overcoming challenges in publishing high-impact IS research|journal=European Journal of Information Systems|volume=16|year=2007|pages=317–326|doi=10.1057/palgrave.ejis.3000695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Data Visualization Lab, Center for Coastal and Ocean Mapping, UNH, Durham NH.jpg|thumb|right|250px|&lt;center&gt;Data Visualization Lab&lt;/center&gt;]]
The '''Center for Coastal &amp; Ocean Mapping''' ('''CCOM''') / [[NOAA]]-UNH Joint Hydrographic Center ('''JHC''') was founded in 2000 by [[Larry Mayer|Dr. Larry Mayer]] to find ways to process the massive amounts of data coming from sonar systems at rates commensurate with data collection; that is, to make the data ready for chart production as rapidly as the data could be collected. 

The center is located in the Chase Ocean Engineering building on the campus of the [[University of New Hampshire]] in [[Durham, New Hampshire]], United States.

The center works on a wide range of marine research topics, including:
* [[Hydrography]]
* Improved bathymetric processing
* Improved [[side-scan sonar]] and [[backscatter]] processing
* Data Visualization with emphasis on whale tracking, flow visualization, and mid-water fish
* Seafloor characterization
* [[Lidar]]
* [[Photographic mosaic]]
* [[Law of the Sea]] mapping for the United States
* Electronic chart of the future and the marine [[Automatic Identification System]]
* Acoustic positioning and tracking

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42102">The '''conservation and restoration of fur objects''' is the preservation and protection of objects made from or containing [[fur]].  These pieces can include personal items like fur clothing or objects of cultural heritage that are housed in [[museum]]s and [[collection (artwork)|collection]]s.  When dealing with the latter, a [[conservator-restorer]] often handles their care, whereas, for the public, professional [[wikt:furrier|furriers]] can be found in many neighborhoods.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

== Definition of Types of Fur Objects ==

=== Pelts ===
[[File:Puma fur skin.jpg|thumb|Puma Pelt|375x375px]]Pelts are defined as the skin of an animal that still has the hair or fur intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=|title=Pelt|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelt|journal=The Free Dictionary|page=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/pelt|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animals used for traditional fur objects alternate between a winter and summer [[Coat (animal)|coat]].  The winter coats of animals are normally more desirable because they are thicker and fuller than the summer coats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_l/L101.pdf|title=How to Prepare Pelts|last=College of Agricultural, Consumer and Environmental Sciences|first=|date=October 2012|website=How to Prepare Pelts|publisher=New Mexico State University|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pelts are removed from the animal in a process of [[skinning]] and fleshing that removes all the tissue from the skin and pelt.  The pelts are then [[Curing (food preservation)|cured]] and [[Tanning (leather)|tanned]] to kill bacteria and create a stable material.  Pelts are traditionally used to create clothing and home accessories like rugs, they can be mounted to create trophies or taxidermy specimens, or they can be sold and kept as is.

==== Differences between hair and fur ====
The only difference between [[hair]] and [[fur]] is semantics.  Technically, both are made from [[keratin]], which is also the protein that makes up [[skin]], [[feather]]s, [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]], [[Hoof|hooves]], [[claw]]s, and [[Horn (anatomy)|horns]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/58251/whats-difference-between-hair-and-fur|title=What’s the Difference Between Hair and Fur?|website=Mental Floss|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   &lt;blockquote&gt;"The way I think a lot of people understand fur versus hair is in the density of follicles," says Ross McPhee, Curator of the Department of [[Mammalogy]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]]. "So for fur-bearing animals—which were converted into coats and so-forth—people always wanted it to be something that was very dense, so there’s the idea therefore that fur is dense, and it certainly is in [the] kinds of fur-bearers that we use for this purpose. Whereas hair is not so dense. There's less of it."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;This remains untrue however, because the human head has as the same "follicle density" as a mouse, but it just so happens to be genetically predisposed to stop at the head and not continue down the body.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  There are three types of hair: ground hair, guard hair, and [[whiskers]].  "Ground hair is used primarily as insulation and is soft, while guard hair is for protection from the elements and tends to be coarse."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Both ground hair and guard hair are classified as fur.  Because human hair acts as both, it can technically be called "fur".  In reality, the keratin fibers that are described variously as [[hair]], [[wool]], or [[fur]], depending on the animal type, are all referring to the same thing.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation of leather : and related materials|last=Kite|first=Marion|last2=Thomson|first2=Roy|publisher=Elsevier Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2006|isbn=9780750648813|location=Oxford, England|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Taxidermy section - Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology - DSC02419.JPG|thumb|Taxidermy Animals at the Kunming Natural History Museum of Zoology]]

=== [[Taxidermy|Taxidermy Specimens]] ===
Taxidermy has been around since the times of the [[Ancient Egyptians]].  While more mummification than traditional taxidermy, the Egyptians still preserved animals in their form by removing the innards and drying the carcass with salts from the [[Nile]] to [[dehydrate]] and preserve.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ravishingbeasts.com/a-short-history-of-taxidermy/|title=taxidermy - A Short History of Taxidermy|website=www.ravishingbeasts.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The earliest known pieces of modern taxidermy are from the beginning of the sixteenth century, when the development and perfection of taxidermic techniques were linked to Western Europe’s fascination with the natural world.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Through the ages, taxidermy has progressed.  During the Victorian era, taxidermy became closer to what is seen in museums today.  There was a transition from using [[straw]], [[paper]], and other materials to create the mountings for the hides to using internal structures with rods and the actual animal skulls.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Taxidermy is still used in museums and collections today.  Most notable is the work of [[Carl Akeley]], who modernized the idea of including taxidermied specimens in recreations of their natural habitats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fieldmuseum.org/carl-akeley|title=Carl Akeley|last=admin|date=2011-11-29|website=The Field Museum|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Fur clothing|Clothing and Accessories]]  ===
Human beings have been wearing fur since the beginning of time.  There is evidence that [[Ötzi]], the Iceman, was wearing a pelt when he met his demise 5000 years ago.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In classic antiquity, the ancient [[Egyptians]], [[Phoenicia]]ns, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] all used fur or pelts in clothing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In Western Europe, beginning in the 11th Century, luxury furs such as [[Stoat|ermine]], [[mink]], [[sable]], and [[chinchilla]] were reserved for the royalty, [[nobility]], high ranking [[clergy]], and the [[bourgeoisie]].&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fashionintime.org/history-fur-fashion-introduction/|title=History of Fur in Fashion: Introduction|date=2011-12-04|website=History of Fashion|language=en-US|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fur and the access to it became a way of sublimating the lower classes in the 16th and 17th centuries and were strictly controlled.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The [[North American fur trade]], during the 17th and 18th centuries, provided enough pelts of [[hare]], [[rabbit]], [[Sheep|lamb]], and [[Gray wolf|wolf]] to appeal to the crowd that could not afford the luxury furs, which remained to be only accessible to the elite.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;  The royal families of Europe frequently use ermine to create robes and line their crowns.  However, before the 19th century, fur was used as accents, like linings, accessories, and for trimming gowns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Full fur jackets did not appear on the fashion scene until the mid-19th century as a display of wealth by the newly prosperous middle class.  [[Sealskin|Seal skin]] was one of the first furs to be used for a coat.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Fashion went through waves of monkeys, mice, and cat fur dressing during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.  The turn of the century focused on the exotic animals like [[lion]]s, [[tiger]]s, [[leopard]]s, and [[polar bear]] fur.  The [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species]], stopped the exotic animal fur market and the later part of the 20th century focused once again on more accessible fur like rabbit.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Today, fur is a very controversial issue with groups like [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] protesting the entire fur industry and designers, like Armani, have decided to go "[http://alive.armani.com/us/pages/politica-del-gruppo-armani-per-la-sostenibilita-e-responsabilita-sociale/fur-free-policy/ fur free]."

==== [[Modern art|Modern Art]] ====
There are several notable instances of pieces of Modern Art in museums and collections made from, in part, of fur.  The most famous is a piece of [[Surrealist Art]] made by [[Méret Oppenheim]] called ''[[Le Déjeuner en fourrure|Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' or ''Luncheon in Fur'', which is in the permanent collection at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] (see Notable Example below).  Inarguably, it is the most famous piece of art containing fur that is not a piece of furniture.  Oppenheim once wrote of the spirit of her piece, "fur combined with a teacup evokes such a surprising mix of messages and associations. The fur may remind viewers of wild animals and nature, while the teacup could suggest manners and civilization. With its pelt, the teacup becomes soft, rounded, and highly tactile.  It seems attractive to the touch, if not, on the other hand, to the taste: Imagine drinking from it, and the physical sensation of wet fur filling the mouth." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.moma.org/learn/moma_learning/meret-oppenheim-object-paris-1936|title=MoMA {{!}} Meret Oppenheim. Object. Paris, 1936|website=www.moma.org|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the years, she created other pieces that included fur or hide in some manner.  She became so synonymous with the medium, she was known as "the artist that works with fur;" a label which she refused to embrace&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hyperallergic.com/91443/talking-about-meret-oppenheim-an-interview-with-lisa-wenger/|title=Talking about Meret Oppenheim: An Interview with Lisa Wenger|date=2013-12-06|website=Hyperallergic|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was nonetheless known for.

Furniture is another highly collected area of Modern Art that features fur.  Artist, [[Alvar Aalto]] is famous for representing [[Finland]] in the Modern [[Scandinavian design]].  His chair, Armchair 400 made with reindeer fur is a great example of this.  The MFA in Boston houses another famous [http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/chairchair-35134 chair] with fur made by [[Richard Artschwager]].

==== [[Contemporary art|Contemporary Art]] ====
Contemporary artists are starting to embrace the use of fur as a medium as well.  In 2014, an opera singer and artist named Mateo Blanco, gained notoriety for creating celebrity portraits out of dog fur, which are housed at the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!|Orlando Odditorium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ripleys.com/blog/mateo-blanco-dog-fur/|title=Fluffy Portraits Made with Dog Hair|date=2014-12-10|website=Ripley's Believe It or Not!|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;   And, in 2015, [[Danny Rozin]] debuted a piece entitled "[https://vimeo.com/128375543 PomPom Mirror]" as part of a new artist's exhibition at [[Bitforms gallery|bitforms]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2015/05/an-interactive-fur-mirror-by-daniel-rozin/|title=An Interactive 'Fur' Mirror by Daniel Rozin|date=2015-05-26|website=Colossal|language=en-US|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The piece uses faux fur and an [[Xbox]] [[kinect]] system to make the fur balls move and create a mirror effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bitforms.com/rozin-2015/pompom-mirror|title=bitforms gallery  » PomPom Mirror|website=www.bitforms.com|access-date=April 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlin based artist,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ninastaehli.ch/biography|title=cv &amp; media|website=www.ninastaehli.ch|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nina Staehli, uses fur in several of her pieces.  ''[http://www.ninastaehli.ch/installations-sculptures/glory-scape glory scape]'', is a "fur sculpture series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ninastaehli.ch/installations-sculptures/glory-scape|title=glory scape|website=www.ninastaehli.ch|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;" created by the artist that has traveled the world and features pelts of a variety of animals.  
[[File:Leather.jpg|thumb|Leather]]

=== [[Leather]] ===
Leather is the "skin of an animal, with the hair removed, prepared for use by tanning or a similar process designed to preserve it against decay and make it pliable or supple when dry".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/leather|title=the definition of leather|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While technically not fur, leather is a byproduct and the skin on the reverse side of pelts suffer the same kind of damage as leather products which include [[acid hydrolysis]], [[Redox|oxidation]], metals and salts from the [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] process, heat, and [[humidity]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  These issues also affect fur objects.

==== Dealing with Leather Objects ====
While closely related, the [[Conservation and restoration of leather objects|Conservation and Restoration of Leather Objects]] is a separate specialty.

== Causes of Deterioration of Fur Objects ==
[[File:Anthrenus flavipes larvae adult wool.jpg|thumb|Carpet beetles eating wool]]

=== Insects  ===
"Furs are among the most exquisite delicacies for critters...&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;"  "Fiber-feeding insects need the vitamins and amino acids found in their scavenger diet.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;"  "Clean fur lacks these supplements and must be contaminated with a certain amount of soilage like perspiration, body oils, airborne micro-organisms before insects become and issue.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  The only "clean" fur is one that has been sterilized through conservation efforts.  The most common insects that infest fur objects are [[moth]]s and [[Dermestidae|carpet beetles]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Most pests will lay eggs on or inside the object and the larvae will actually cause the most damage as they grow to adulthood.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Infestation is evidenced by small piles of dust, the [[frass]] and [[Moulting|casts]] of the insects in shedding in their growth cycle.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Evidence of previous infestations on fur objects include the bodies of dead insects and their [[Moulting|casings]] on the surface of the object and "concave scars" with a "scalloped" appearance from their round [[Mandible (insect mouthpart)|mandibles]].&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Rodents and other small mammals may also be attracted to fur objects as a food source.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  This kind of infestation would be visible in droppings and larger areas of damage.

=== Temperature and Humidity ===
Temperature is vital for the long-term care of fur objects.  Store rooms should be kept at a relative humidity level of between 45% and 55%, with fluctuations to be expected, but 65% would critical for mold growth,&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://conservation.myspecies.info/node/32|title=standards in the care of skins and taxidermy collections {{!}} Conservation and Collections Care|website=conservation.myspecies.info|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which skin items are highly susceptible to.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  This may require the use of a humidifier or dehumidifier depending on the institution.  Temperature should be kept as stable as possible between 10&amp;nbsp;°C and 22&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  "Warm environments can cause the release of residual fats in skins resulting in hair loss.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;"  Excessive heat causes shrinkage in the fibers, it makes the skin brittle and more prone to tears.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Whereas excess moisture leads to swelling, distortion, putrefaction (if not properly cured) and mold growth.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The combination of both cause the collagen to break down and threaten the physical integrity of the piece.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Some insecticides used as pest prevention like, [[Camphor]], [[Naphthalene|napthalene]], and [[para-dichlorobenzene]] (PDB) can be harmful to some colors if used with dyed fur objects.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In general, hair fibers are "difficult to destroy" because keratin is such a strong fiber.  Strong acids will not break down the fiber and strong bases "will do no more than soften or possibly bleach" the fur.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  However, if a fur object is subjected to that kind of treatment, the hair will become brittle and break off.

=== Improper Storage ===
If fur objects have not been protected from the environment around them then they are susceptible to dirt and dust.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Motes settle between the fibers and create a dirty appearance.  Light exposure is also an issue.  Exposure to ultraviolet light in daylight and artificial light causes pigments in specimens to fade.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://icon.org.uk/what-is-conservation/caring-your-collection|title=Caring for your collection {{!}} Icon|website=icon.org.uk|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Light should be kept at between 50 - 100 lux for display and no light in storage.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;      
[[File:Wild cat fur coat, front.jpg|thumb|259x259px|Normal wear and tear]]

=== Handling ===
Fur objects are made from organic materials which are soilable.  For clothing and accessories, the objects are subjected to the wear and tear of everyday use may include, soiling and staining made by food, make-up, sweat, odor, or skin grease that can leave permanent marks on the fur altering both its color and texture.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Make-up and oils can cause the hairs to stick together.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/daily-southtown/community/chi-ugc-article-why-a-fur-coat-needs-cleaning-and-storage-2016-03-30-story.html|title=Why a Fur Coat needs Cleaning and Storage|last=UGC|first=Chicago Tribune|website=Daily Southtown|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Wearing can also result in physical damage to the object through overuse.  Friction at the joints, like the armpits, elbows, and collar of a coat can cause bald areas.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;  Stitching unraveling and rips are also common issues that arise from wearing a fur object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves should be worn when handling fur objects to prevent and transfer.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

=== Taxidermy Issues ===
Older specimens were filled with straw and paper to recreate the musculature of the animals.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/13067/11-things-you-probably-didnt-know-about-taxidermy|title=11 Things You Probably Didn't Know About Taxidermy|website=Mental Floss|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because the physicality of the animal was changed in mounting, the pelt would have become stretched or distorted to fit the new shape.  A prime example of this was a rhinoceros that belonged to Louis XIV and Louis XV.  "Its skin was varnished and stretched over a frame of wooden hoops.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;"  The skin is now on display at the [[National Museum of Natural History (France)|Museum national d’Histoire naturelle]] in Paris, but is it unlikely it could be remounted.

== Cleaning ==
The care and cleaning of fur objects should always be undertaken by a trained [[Collection manager|collections manager]] or [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]].

=== Dry Cleaning ===

==== Brushing and Vacuuming ====
[[File:Filbert brush.jpg|thumb|205x205px|Natural hair brush]]
Provided there is no shedding issue, brushing is the first step in cleaning fur objects.  Light brushing, using a paintbrush,&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://squirrel.adobeconnect.com/_a751959191/p18c8t9f0v5/?launcher=false&amp;fcsContent=true&amp;pbMode=normal|title=HP C2C Seminar_30|website=squirrel.adobeconnect.com|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; will help dislodge any particulate soiling, surface dust, and insect frass.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Stiffer natural brushes can be used if the dirt is stubborn but metal brushes should never be used.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  A variable speed vacuum with brushes and other attachments works on most surface dirt as well as removing the remnants of an insect infestation.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  The vacuum should be set to low and a muslin or net should be placed over the nozzle to protect the object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  HEPA filters should be used if arsenic preservation is suspected.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Sponging ====
Greasy dirt can be removed with a vulcanized rubber&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; sponge known as "soot sponges," because they are also great at removing smoke and soot, which are often the residue of museums or collections that were heated with coal heat in the past.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;  Cosmetic sponges can also be in conjunction with the vacuum to remove even more surface dirt.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Wet Cleaning ===
Wet cleaning is incredibly harmful to protein materials.  Processes like dry-cleaning [[solvent]]s, [[oil]], [[wax]]es, lubricants, and [[saddle soap]]s actually can remove the natural protective oils causing further drying that can lead to [[embrittlement]].&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators|last=Bachmann|first=Konstanze|publisher=Smithsonian Books|year=1992|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When solvents are absolutely necessary, they should be spot tested before overall use to ensure there is no harmful dyeing or bleaching.  If it was determined safe, the solvent should be applied with a swab going in the direction of the fur.  If possible, absorbent paper should be placed under the strands being treated to separate them from unnecessarily getting solvent on the rest of the object.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Fur objects can often become stiff or distorted, but steaming or spraying water directly on the object can cause damage.  The solution for misshapen objects is increased humidity as a restorative tool.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Freezing ===
The only sure way of removing pest infestation on fur objects is through freezing.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Objects should be placed inside a clear polyester bag, the excess air should be removed and it should be heat sealed.  An alternative is a polyethylene bag with parcel tape.  The bag can be placed in a domestic freezer for at least 14 days at a temperature of -18&amp;nbsp;°C or for 72 hours at -30&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  It is important to note that if the atmosphere is maintained at a high humidity point in very low temperatures, the moisture will form frost on the object and with too little humidity, the object will absorb what little moisture there is and dry out, so it is vital to maintain the proper environment even in freezing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Cold storage, at 10&amp;nbsp;°C is recommended at all times to inhibit insect activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pool|first=Marilen|date=Spring 1997|title=Preliminary Analysis of the Effects of Cold Storage on Fur Garments and Mammal Skins|url=http://www.spnhc.org/media/assets/cofo_1997_V13_N1_new.pdf|journal=Collection Forum|doi=|pmid=|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repair and Restoration ==
Conservation efforts must take into account the properties of both the fur and skin.  The objects have already been through the stresses of "fur-skin processing,"&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; which can weaken the object.  Physical damage that happens during the skin processing may only become evident with the passage of time.  If the skin was pared too deeply during fleshing, the result would be eventual hair loss.  It will also become evident, over time, if the fur was removed from the animal too early in the season.  This means that the bulbs of the hair had not fully completed the growth process and the hair will fall out, leaving a sparse pelt.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While, "[m]ost dry animal fiber can be extended or stretched up to 30 percent of its length before break occurs,&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/analyzingfurdama541penc|title=Analyzing fur damage with a microscope|last=Pence|first=Roy J. (Roy James)|date=1966-01-01|publisher=[Berkeley, Calif.] : Division of Agricultural Sciences, University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt;" it is unclear the object has been through before entering the collection.

=== Filling/Patching and Dyeing ===
Generally, fur objects are fragile and, for a variety of reasons, they can experience loss.  The process of filling is a common practice.  Filling is a standard procedure in which synthetic fur, most commonly made of white [[nylon]] with a "four-way spandex stretch backing.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic37-01-010.html|title=SYNTHETIC FILL MATERIALS FOR SKIN, LEATHER, AND FURS|last=Nieuwenhuizen|first=Linda|date=1998-01-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  There are three standard fur lengths that include short (2.5–5.0&amp;nbsp;cm); medium (8.0–10.0&amp;nbsp;cm); and long (10.0–15.0&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The use of white synthetic fur allows for tinting or dying before application.  It is recommended that nylon furs "can be dyed with acid or premetalized dyes according to the manufacturer's directions at pH 5.5 and pH 7 or slightly above, respectively. The dyed fabric must be subjected to an after-scour at 140°F.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;"

The first step in the physical filling is creating a backing that is applied to bridge the area of loss and the fill material.  The "most commonly used materials for backings are inert fabrics coupled with either resins, starches, or cellulose ethers with evaporative solvents, or resins or systems requiring the use of a heat-seal process.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;"  The next step is creating a template of the area of loss.  That template is then transferred to the fur and cut to size.  The patch should be applied to the object with "Acryloid F-10 in acetone" by applying the adhesive directly to a substrate inserted in the hole and placed the edged of the fill directly adjacent sides of the existing fur.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;  The full should then be cut and textured to match the surrounding fur.  As with all conservation efforts, it should be fully documented and reversible.

Of course, real fur can also be used to patch.  Like fur is often available for common repairs like [[rabbit]] and [[fox]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Preventative Care, Maintenance, and Storage ==
"Of all the items made from natural materials, those derived from animal skins are some of the most versatile and durable found in collections.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mnhs.org/preserve/conservation/connectingmn/docs_pdfs/repurposedbook-skinandskinProducts_000.pdf|title=Skin and Skin Products (Leather)|last=Minnesota Historical Society|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  However, all fur is subject to damage from light and temperature, therefore care should be taken to mitigate their effects.  Also, an [[Museum integrated pest management|integrated pest management system]] must be employed because organic materials are especially susceptible to pests.

=== Pelts ===
Skin garments and hides should be stored on flat mounts which supports the item when it is in storage and facilitates movement of the object without undue flexing and handling.  If the object needs to be stuffed to maintain shape, unbuffered [[Acid-free paper|acid-free tissue]] should be used.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Taxidermy Specimens ===
The height of taxidermy in the Victorian Age brought forth the invention of "arsenical soap.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marte|first=Fernando|last2=Pequignot|first2=Amandine|last3=Endt|first3=David W. Von|date=2006-01-01|title=Arsenic in taxidermy collections: History, detection, and management|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237749788_Arsenic_in_taxidermy_collections_History_detection_and_management|volume=21|issue=1|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"  French [[pharmacist]] and [[Conservation movement|naturalist]], [[Jean-Baptiste Bécœur|Jean-Baptiste Bécoeur]], invented a type of paste in 1738 to prevent pest infestation in taxidermy specimens, preserve skin and prevent the decay of remaining flesh.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.examiner.net/article/20090926/news/309269913/?Start=1|title=Arsenic and old mounts – be careful|last=Fox|first=Gene|website=Examiner|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He came up with a mixture of ground [[Arsenic trisulfide|arsenic]], [[camphor]], [[potassium carbonate]], powdered [[calcium hydroxide]], and soap which kept pests at bay.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  He was renowned for his specimens and treatment of them but, in his lifetime, he refused to disclose his exact recipe.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  In 1820, French taxidermist [[Louis Dufresne]], determined the formula and popularized it,&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; making it the standard until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Taxidermist then opted for [[Borax]] because it is nontoxic though, ultimately less effective in pest prevention.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The use of arsenical soap leaves a does not compromise the actual specimen, but is hazardous to both museum workers and guests.  Arsenic can sometimes be detected visually as the compound usually crystallizes into white "arsenic dust" that normally creates deposits at the base of hairs, feathers, around the eyes, in or at the base of ears, around mouths or bills, and on foot pads.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   However, the lack of arsenic dust does no preclude specimens from having previous treatment with the compound.  The most efficient way to test is with the ''Arsenic Paper Test'' kit manufactured by the Macherey-Nagel Corporation.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The test involves rubbing cotton swab, moistened with distilled water, and rubbing it on the contaminated specimen.  The tip is then cut off and placed in a flask with water, then after an hour, it is added to concentrated [[Hydrochloric acid|chlorydric acid]] and around [[Zinc oxide|zinc]] powder.  A test strip is then introduced and, determining the color, it can be assessed whether the object is contaminated or not.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  "It is safer to assume that all mammal and bird specimens collected and prepared before the 1980s may be contaminated with arsenic, and to follow proper handling guidelines.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/8776130/Care_of_Arsenic-Contaminated_Taxidermy_and_Ethnographic_Collections|title=Care of Arsenic-Contaminated Taxidermy and Ethnographic Collections|website=www.academia.edu|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

If the object is contaminated with arsenic, proper steps must be taken to remit the toxin and keep the environment safe.  Specimens that test positive must have "Arsenic Contaminated" clearly visible on their label and be separated from other specimens.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.shu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1255&amp;context=theses|title=Poisonous Heritage: Pesticides in Museum Collections|last=Omstein|first=Leslie|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nitrile rubber|Nitrile]] gloves and a protective apron, as well as a [[respirator]], should be mandatory when dealing with these specimens.  The specimen should be vacuumed with a [[HEPA|HEPA filter]] in a well-ventilated space.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  These objects should be continuously tested every two or three years because arsenic was usually applied to the inside of the specimen as well, and can migrate from the inside to the outside of the specimen.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Arsenic was commonly used among [[Ethnography|ethnographic]] specimens as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic35-01-003.html|title=A HISTORY OF PEST CONTROL MEASURES IN THE ANTHROPOLOGY COLLECTIONS, NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY, SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION|last=Goldberg|first=Lisa|date=1996-01-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mounted specimens should be kept on their original bases for storage purposes and encased in custom [[Ethafoam]] cases.  The Ethafoam should be secured to the mount with cotton twill tape or [[polyethylene]] covered twist ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn14/wn14-2/wn14-205.html|title=Storage Methods for Taxidermy Specimens|last=Fuller|first=Tamsen|date=1992-05-01|website=cool.conservation-us.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This limits damage due to handling the fur object.

=== Clothing and Accessories ===
Fur, by nature, is heavy, therefore care should be taken when storing these objects.  When storing fur clothing, well-padded hangars should be employed and no furs should be packed so close to each other that they can crush of flatten one another.  [[Cotton]], [[silk]], or [[Tyvek]] bags should be used to enclose each fur, making sure the weave of the bag is fine enough to keep out insects.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Saving Stuff: How to Care for and Preserve Your Collectibles, Heirlooms, and Other Prized Possessions|last=Williams|first=Don|last2=Jagger|first2=Louisa|publisher=Fireside/Simon &amp; Schuster|year=2005|isbn=9780743264167|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Straps should never be used to support objects, even if that is their given function.  The piece should either be stored flat or a support should be supplied at the base, allowing the straps or handles to be supported in a natural, unstressed, position.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Display Issues ==
For display, the piece should have adequate support for the weight and fragility of the object so it is not wrinkled or under stress.  In reference to garments, [[mannequin]]s should be tailored appropriately to fit the intended piece and custom mounts should be made for accessories.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  [[Acrylic paint|Acrylic]] mounts provide the best support for heavy materials.  They also can be heated to conform to an object's exact surface shape.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;  Padding should be applied so the object is not stressed by the hard [[Plexiglas]].  Large pelts should be displayed on tiled boards covered in a "coarse textile to help grip the item.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;"  Metal hangars, pins, or clips should never be used to display fur objects because the metal can react with the oils in the skin and stain the object,&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; known as [[verdigris]].&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;  Exhibitors must be aware of the agents of deterioration.  Heat, light, and humidity should be carefully monitored in whatever environment is created for the display of the objects.  Fur objects should not be exposed to more light than 5 footcandles - 18&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;  The exhibitor should also plan on rotating pieces during a long exhibition due to fading and physical damage that may occur.  The exhibit space must also be routinely inspected for rodents and other pests.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Notable Examples ==
[[File:Samson the gorilla (23547597554).jpg|thumb|Samson at the Milwaukee Public Museum]]

=== [https://www.mpm.edu/plan-visit/exhibitions/permanent-exhibits/first-floor-exhibits/samson Samson] at the [[Milwaukee Public Museum]] ===
Samson was a [[Gorilla|Silverback Gorilla]] that lived at the [[Milwaukee County Zoo]] from 1950 to 1981.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.taxidermy.net/forum/index.php?topic=163318.0|title=Tribute To "Samson"|website=www.taxidermy.net|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a crowd favorite for his size and frequent acts of banging on the glass of his enclosure.  After his death of a heart attack, Samson's remains were given to the Milwaukee Public Museum like his brother, Sambo's, had been in 1959 for taxidermy purposes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Samson's bones were re-articulated sometime after and displayed in the museum's exhibit paying tribute to [[Victorian era]] museology, "The Sense of Wonder," next to an upright human skeleton and a smaller ape.

In 2006, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of his death, the Milwaukee Public Museum planned to mount an exhibit in his honor with a taxidermy specimen of Samson taking center stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mpm.edu/plan-visit/exhibitions/permanent-exhibits/first-floor-exhibits/samson|title=Samson {{!}} Milwaukee Public Museum|website=www.mpm.edu|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, "[w]hen curators went to mount his hide, they found his freeze-dried hide had deteriorated too much to use in a taxidermy mount.”&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/29228414.html|title=Samson comes alive!|website=www.jsonline.com|access-date=April 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His pelt was determined to be unsalvageable, to it fell to staff taxidermist, Wendy Christiansen-Senk, to recreate Samson from scratch.

Because Samson was a frequently documented local hero, Christiansen-Senk had a lot of material to work with.  The most invaluable research she had was the insight of former zookeeper and Samson caregiver, Sam LaMalfa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.zoosociety.org/Education/FunStuff/SamsonMemories.php|title=Memories of Samson the Gorilla {{!}} Zoological Society of Milwaukee|website=www.zoosociety.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During her recreation, she consulted Samson's bones, videos of him at the zoo, photographs, his death mask (which is also part of the [[Milwaukee Public Museum|MPM]] collection), and LaMalfa.  "In conventional taxidermy we would use the real skin, tailoring the mannequin to fit the real skin. In this case I had to come up with hair and textures and colors, and try to match the hair on the body of one animal. It's a lot more challenging method.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;" said Christiansen-Senk in 2006 regarding the effort.  Christiansen-Senk molded a [[silicone]] face using Samson’s death mask and thousands of photographs.  She then purchased a replica gorilla skeleton and yak and synthetic hair.  She spent more than a year implanting individual hairs into Samson's silicone face.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/taxidermy/christy-text|title=Still Life|last=Christy|first=Bryan|website=National Geographic|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Christiansen-Senk matched the coloring and patterning on Samson so convincingly that LaMalfa said, upon seeing the completed model, "That's him. I'm waiting for him to move so I can talk to him.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

The result was so amazing, Christiansen-Senk entered her recreation in the 2009 World Taxidermy Championship, where she won first prize for the best recreation and the Judge's Choice Best in Show against real animal taxidermy entries.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;  Samson remains on permanent exhibit at the Milwaukee Public Museum.     
     
=== ''[[Le Déjeuner en fourrure|Object (Le Déjeuner en fourrure)]]'' at the [[Museum of Modern Art]]  ===
In 1936, [[Alfred H. Barr, Jr.|Alfred H. Barr Jr.]], the young director of New York's Museum of Modern Art approached Méret Oppenheim to negotiate purchasing ''Luncheon in Fur''.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2016/02/09/466061492/luncheon-in-fur-the-surrealist-tea-cup-that-stirred-the-art-world|title='Luncheon In Fur': The Surrealist Teacup That Stirred The Art World|website=NPR.org|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Oppenheim expressed a willingness to sell and Barr paid $50 to make history. ''Luncheon in Fur'' was the first work by a woman the museum acquired and Oppenheim is dubbed the First Lady of MoMA.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  As the First Lady, Oppenheim reportedly gave instructions for the conservation of her piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/surrealismandmagic/exhibition/seer/bibliophile.html|title=Surrealism and Magic|website=rmc.library.cornell.edu|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those instructions have not been made public, but the piece has been on display in a "Plexiglas [[Display case|vitrine]]" since 1947&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mortality Immortality?: The Legacy of 20th-century Art|last=Corzo|first=Miguel Angel|last2=Getty Conservation Institute|publisher=Getty Publications|year=1999|isbn=9780892365289|location=|pages=x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as "balding.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;"

It is assumed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.khanacademy.org/humanities/art-1010/art-between-wars/surrealism1/a/meret-oppenheim-object-fur-covered-cup-saucer-and-spoon|title=Khan Academy|website=Khan Academy|access-date=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Oppenheim glued the cream-and-tan pelt of a Chinese [[gazelle]]&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; to her now famous china.  The adhesive dates from the creation of the object in 1936, so may be breaking down.  Also, the lighting and the fact it is on exhibit so frequently cause conservation concerns.  Ideally, the object would be conserved in accordance with today's standards, but the directive Oppenheim left may speak more towards her intent as an artist and any attempt to conserve the piece could alter its "original state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Conservation Treatment Methodology|last=Appelbaum|first=Barbara|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7506-8274-9|location=Oxford|pages=173–193}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

'''Digital photograph restoration''' is the practice of restoring the appearance of a digital copy of a physical photograph which has been damaged by natural, man made, or environmental causes or simply affected by age or neglect.

Digital photograph restoration uses a variety of [[image editing]] techniques to remove visible damage and aging effects from digital copies of physical photographs. [[Raster graphics editor]]s (see list below) are typically used to repair the appearance of the digital images and add to the digital copy of the photo where pieces of the physical photograph are torn or missing. Evidence of dirt, scratches, and other signs of photographic age are removed from the digital image manually, by painting over them meticulously.  Unwanted color casts are removed and the image's contrast or sharpening may be altered in an attempt to restore some of the contrast range or detail that is believed to be in the original physical image. In addition [[image processing]] techniques such as [[image enhancement]] and [[image restoration]] are also applicable for the purpose of digital photograph restoration.

There are many methods for teaching [[Drama]].  Each strategy involves varying levels of student participation.

==Drama games==
Drama games, activities and exercises are often used to introduce students to drama.  These activities tend to be less intrusive and are highly participatory (e.g. [[Bang (Drama Game)|Bang]]).

There are several books that have been written on using drama games that can serve as excellent resources for anyone wanting to incorporate drama games into their work. [[Augusto Boal|Games for Actors and Non-Actors]] by [[Augusto Boal]] is perhaps the best known internationally and includes writings on his life work as well as hundreds of games. There are also smaller books however, which serve as excellent practical guides. For example, Drama Games by [[Bernie Warren]] is an excellent pocket book for someone looking to try drama games for the first time.

==Choral speaking==
Choral dramatization involves students reading aloud by assigning parts to each group member.  Choral dramatization can use texts such as [[rhymes]], [[poetry]], and [[picture books]].  Students can experiment with voice, sound gesture and movement (Swartz, 1995).

==Tableaux==
[[Tableau vivant|Tableaux]] involve students creating visual pictures with their bodies, emphasizing key details and relationships (Wilheim, 2002). Tableaux are frozen scenes and usually involve at least three levels.  Students focus on a focal point, facial expressions, and body language.  This technique is useful for maturing participants' presentational skills as well as audience skills.

==Improvisation==
[[Improvisation]] is the practice of acting and reacting, of making and creating, in the moment and in response to the stimulus of one’s immediate environment; see [[Improvisation|Wikipedia: Improvisation]]. Improvisation can be a great introduction to role playing.  Students focus on position, expression and creativity in their impromptu skits.

==Role playing==
Role playing allows students to play a [[Character (arts)|character]] in a real or imaginary situation.  One of the simplest forms is where “the student plays himself faced with an imaginary situation.” (Wilheim, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;62) Other strategies have students playing real-life or imaginary characters in a variety of contexts.  Role play can be used throughout many areas of the curriculum, especially [[history]] and [[language arts]] to support and strengthen understanding of content.  Below is a list of some common role-play strategies.

* [[Historical reenactment|Reenactment]]: Students perform scenes from a historical time period or a scene in a story.  “An enactment may be cast in the past, the present, or the future, but always happens in the ‘now of time’” (Wilheim, 2002, p.8).  This strategy encourages students to interact with a text and challenges them to take on the [[Perspective (cognitive)|perspective]] of a character.
* Extended role play: Students may create the scene that takes place before or after a story or scene.  This strategy helps students to predict and theorize about cause and effect.
* Hotseat: Student is interviewed in character.  By putting the character from a scene, event or story on the “stand” students can further explore their understanding of the content.  Other students in the class prepare questions that explore the character and their conflicts.  Students are encouraged to write open-ended questions.  Teachers may wish to model hotseating first by acting as the character in the role.  Also, the person in the hotseat may have a couple of students who act as their “brain.”  They are there to help answer questions if the person on the hotseat needs them.  There are many variations available for this strategy.
* Teacher In Role: This strategy is key to involving teacher participation.  This strategy can take on many forms.  The teacher may take on the role of a character or figure from the event, scene or story.  The primary objective of this strategy is to allow students to ask questions and help discover answers to any unresolved issues.  The teacher may also choose to immerse themselves in the scene and take on a role while interacting with other characters.  The primary role in this situation is to further the evolving drama.
* Expert panel: Students themselves become an [[expert]].  In order to prepare for this role students must determine what an expert in the area might know.  This works well in history or when focusing on broader issues/topics in literature.  This strategy can unfold by having students meet as a group of experts or by having students meet in pairs in an [[interview]] situation.
* Writing in role: A variation on the above strategies, students may also write in character.  Often they are asked to imagine themselves as a real or fictitious character in a particular state or situation.  Writing in role can take on many forms including a journal, letter, monologue, or newspaper article.  This is not meant to be a summary of the story, but instead a further exploration of the character and their interaction with events.

==Test phase==

The testing phase of this program began in 12 schools in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], the capital of [[Chile]]. After 3 years the program had extended to the Ninth Region, the [[Araucanía Region]], (the part of the country with the largest indigenous population) with more than 100 schools participating in the program.&lt;ref name="two"&gt;{{cite book

==First phase==

From 1995-2007 (the unofficial First Phase of the Enlaces project), the government spent more than $121 million and international cooperation from organizations such as the [[Canadian International Development Agency]] (CIDA) in global education, infrastructure, [[computer]]s, access to educational recourses, technical assistance, and teacher training.&lt;ref name="three"&gt;{{cite web

==Future plans==

In 2007,  the Chilean Ministry of Education presented ExpoEnlaces 2007 where they showcased the latest innovations in [[Information and Communication Technology]] (ICT) so that people can understand the abilities of these new technologies and their uses in the classroom.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; That same year, the Ministry of Education published its new objectives and projects for the coming years. Didier de Saint Pierre, the executive director of Enlaces, divided the program into two phases, the first phase, which is coming to a close, focused on infrastructure in the schools and equipping them to install the necessary programs and administration.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; The second phase involves developing the technological infrastructure so that it has the capacity to improve the quality of learning in Chile.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Once the basic technological infrastructure is in place, the Ministry will extend the technology to the remaining schools in less developed regions, and it will implement new technologies in the more advanced regions.

Examples of the new technologies that Enlaces will implement are [[electronic whiteboard]]s for [[math]], palm pilots or pocket PCs for [[physics]], and projectors for teaching sciences.&lt;ref name="six"/&gt; Other new strategies will include ICT in the classroom, where they will integrate portable technology and projectors in 3,000 classrooms, benefiting 87,000 students (3% of the total number of students). The goal is to implement this program in 16,000 classrooms by 2010.&lt;ref name="seven"&gt;{{cite web

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[science]] program is a good example of the direction in which the Enlaces program is headed. A very important aspect of this program is teaching style. Enlaces encourages the use of the HEI ([[hypothesis]], [[experimentation]], [[Education|instruction]]) method. The new science classes are being developed in a multimedia format using simulations delivered via the internet.&lt;ref name="nine"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Chile - Enlaces hace la mejor clase de Ciencias.
| publisher = OEI - Organización de Estados Iberoamericanos
| date = 2007-08-04
| url = http://www.oei.es/noticias/spip.php?article795
| accessdate = 2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new program offers students many benefits. The classes that follow this methodology better prepare students for lessons and projects. When presented with an experiment, students can form a hypothesis, the teacher can demonstrate every aspect of the experiment using a computer, a projection system, and the internet, and the students can follow the other steps of the scientific method. While the use of simulations is not the exactly the same as doing the physical experiment, simulation eliminates the problem of lack of equipment and materials (such as chemicals for [[chemistry]], and animals for dissection for [[biology]]) that many schools in Chile face.

===Adult Education===

Part of the objective of the Enlaces program is to help the community through [[adult education]]. The idea was that children would bring the technology home with them, but this has not worked the way the Ministry had hoped. The majority of parents (especially those in rural areas) recognize the benefits of technology for their children, but feel that they cannot benefit personally.&lt;ref name="two"/&gt; For adults who do want to learn more about technology, the Enlaces program offers an 18-hour digital literacy class where they learn the basic functions of a computer, how to use a [[word processor]], how to use the [[internet]], and how to create and use an [[email]] account.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt;

[[File:Flotsam on Terschelling.JPG|thumb|Flotsam on a beach at [[Terschelling]], [[Wadden Sea]]]]

In [[maritime law]], ''flotsam'', ''jetsam'', ''lagan'', and ''derelict'' are specific kinds of [[shipwreck]]. The words have specific nautical meanings, with legal consequences in the [[law of admiralty]] and [[marine salvage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/slideshows/8-amusing-stories-behind-common-expressions/6/|title=8 Amusing Stories Behind Common Expressions &amp;#124; Reader's Digest|publisher=Rd.com|date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2011-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shipwreck is defined as the remains of a ship that has been wrecked, a destroyed ship at sea, whether it be sunken or floating on the surface of the water.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge English Dictionary. "Shipwreck definition.": http://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/shipwreck&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
A wreck is categorized as property belonging to no apparent owner, that either sinks to the seabed, or floats on the surface of the water, whether it be intentionally cast overboard, or as the result of an accident. The term encompasses the hull of the vessel and its fixtures, as well as any other form of object on board, such as cargo and stores, and personal effects of the crew and passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1057-2414(99)80024-7 |title=A note on the meaning of 'wreck' |journal=The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=319 |year=1999 |last1=Dromgoole |first1=S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also encompasses the narrower definition of salvage, that is, property that has been recovered from a wreckage, or the recovery of the ship itself.
 
There are a number of factors that contribute to the formation of a shipwreck, that can be divided into physical and cultural processes. A site can be affected by physical processes, that is, naturally occurring processes, such as the corrosion caused by salinity and [[ocean current]]s, or the growth of native and foreign marine organisms. It can also be affected by cultural processes, that is, by human interactions, such as adding or removing materials from the site of the wreck. Any archaeological activity, such as excavation, may also be considered invasive and tampering.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew E. Keith, Society for Historical Archaeology. "Site formation processes of submerged shipwrecks." University Press of Florida (2016){{page needed|date=May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of maritime law, different meanings are attributed to the terms, based on what the jurisdiction is, as well as the context. For example, a distinction is made between goods that wash ashore, from those that are for some reason not salvageable and/or lost at sea.

==Law of salvage==
Ownership of a wreck is a highly controversial issue, as there are no clear lines within which it is defined. It may be acquired through various means that range from succession to confiscation. There is also a distinction to be made between the ownership of the hull itself and the cargo it contains, as the hull may be abandoned intentionally, whereas the cargo may be out of necessity (in the case of an emergency or the need to shed weight from the vessel). In these parameters, abandonment of the ship by its passengers constitutes as a loss of possession, but to abandon the claim on the title itself, intention to relinquish it is required. This affects wrecks by limiting that which is considered "abandoned". Generally, a ship is defined as "abandoned" if there is no hope of recovery, known legally as ''Sine spe recuperandi'' (which is the Latin phrase for "no hope of recovery"), and this fact must be clearly proven by the salvaging party. It must also occur on [[Navigability|navigable waters]].
 
The term "salvage" is used to indicate a salvage operation, as well as the subsequent awarded compensation. It is considered a voluntary service rendered in cases such as danger to the wreck, or the surrounding navigable waters. In terms of compensation, it is seen as being awarded to anyone who voluntarily assisted in the recuperation of the wreck, whether it be saved from upcoming danger, or from loss.

The [[Law of salvage|Law of Salvage]] finds its origins in the Roman practice of ''[[negotiorum gestio]]'', which dictated that one who preserved or improved upon the property of another, was owed compensation from the owner, even if the service was not requested by the latter. The law did not apply to maritime regulations, but were the basis for following ordinances, such as the Marine Ordinance of Trani, which stated that a "finder" was to be rewarded, whether the owner claimed the goods or not. The laws have evolved since ''negotiorum gestio'', and today, in the United States, a salvor who voluntarily brings the goods back into port may legally lay claim to them, or deliver them to a marshal, in return for a reward.&lt;ref name="Norris"&gt;Norris, Martin J."The Law of Salvage". Baker, Voorhis (1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flotsam==
{{redirect|Flotsam}}
Also known as "flotsan", the term "flotsam" refers to a sunken vessel whose goods float to the surface of the sea, or any floating cargo that is cast overboard.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

In terms of maritime law, the definition of flotsam pertains to goods that are floating on the surface of the water as the result of a wreck or an accident. As there is no clear way of defining ownership, one who discovers flotsam is allowed to claim it, unless someone claims ownership to the items in question.&lt;ref name="Colombia Electronic Encyclopedia"&gt;Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th Edition. "Flotsam, jetsam, and ligan". (2016): http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=d8a46f34-d331-4ea7-89bf-e68724ce16ed%40sessionmgr4008&amp;vid=1&amp;hid=4107&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#AN=39006707&amp;db=aph&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jetsam==
{{redirect|Jetsam}}
The term "jetsam" designates any cargo that is intentionally discarded from a ship or wreckage. Legally jetsam also floats, although floating is not part of the etymological meaning. &lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/jetsam | title = jetsam | website = Oxford Living Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, "jettisoning" connotes the action of throwing goods overboard to lighten the load of the ship if it is in danger of being sunk.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

Per maritime law, one who discovers these artifacts is required to return them to their rightful owner only in the case that the latter makes a legally abiding claim.&lt;ref name="Colombia Electronic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

Although, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration "flotsam may be claimed by the original owner, whereas jetsam may be claimed as property of whoever discovers it".&lt;ref&gt;National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration web page [https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/flotsam-jetsam.html What are Flotsam and Jetsam]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lagan==
[[File:NOAA-NDBC-discus-buoy.jpg |thumb|right|125px|A buoy is sufficient to retain claim to an attached artifact]]

Also called "ligan", the term refers to goods that are cast overboard and are heavy enough to sink to the ocean floor, but are tied or otherwise linked to a floating marker, such as a [[buoy]] or cork, so that they can be found again by whoever marked the item. Lagan can also refer to large objects that are trapped within the sinking vessel.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

According to maritime law, a buoy, or otherwise floating object, constitutes as sufficient grounds in laying claim to an artifact. In other words, when faced with a lagan, one is required to return the artifact to its rightful owner.&lt;ref name="Colombia Electronic Encyclopedia"/&gt;

==Derelict==
"Derelict" can refer to goods that have sunk to the ocean floor, relinquished willingly or forcefully by its owner, and thus abandoned, but which no one has any hope of reclaiming.

In terms of maritime law, derelict is considered property abandoned on navigable waters which has no hope of being recovered, or ''sine spe recuperandi'', and no expectation of it being returned to its owner, or ''sine animo revertendi''.&lt;ref name="Norris"/&gt;

[[File:FraunhoferIWM A0059801.jpg|thumb|Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM, Wöhlerstr. 11, Freiburg]]
The '''Fraunhofer Institute for Mechanics of Materials IWM''' ({{lang-de|Fraunhofer-Institut für Werkstoffmechanik}}) in [[Freiburg]], Germany, is a division of the [[Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft]] which focuses upon application-oriented research. The Fraunhofer IWM is a research and development partner for both industry and public institutions whose themes include the safety, reliability, life expectancy and functionality of materials in components and manufacturing processes. The broad spectrum of services offered by the Fraunhofer IWM's business units aid their clients and project partners in the assessment and continuing development of highly stressed materials and components and in the optimization of production process. Established in 1971 in Freiburg in Breisgau, the institute expanded in 1992 to include a location in Halle (Saale). On January 1, 2016, the Halle division of the Fraunhofer IWM became the [[Fraunhofer Institute for Microstructure of materials and Systems]] IMWS.

== Competencies==
Mechanics of Materials at the Fraunhofer IWM address all issues concerning functionality, behavior and the specific properties of materials from the development stage through manufacture, processing and application. Via the material-mechanical expertise of the scientists at the institute, the properties, functionality and stress limitations of materials and components are assessed, adjusted and improved as per specific requirements set forth by their clients. This in-depth know-how lies within situations in which complex and extreme load conditions exist for materials in components and manufacturing processes as well as in performance and efficiency improvements that can only be achieved through a holistic understanding of the various aspects involved. The interaction between experimentation and simulations yields solutions to materials-related issues for nearly all industry sectors.  The scientific, technical “tools” that make up the core competencies of the institute consist of:

== Material and component characterization ==

The Fraunhofer IWM characterizes and assesses material properties within components and production processes as well as the behavior of components across several scales and analyzes the development, manufacturing and application of materials and components and offers critical support by realizing new functionalities and processing steps.

== Material modeling and simulation ==

The Fraunhofer IWM develops and employs mechanism-based material models in order to understand and explain the inner structures of material properties.  These structural property-relationships have a strong influence both on the manufacturing process and in actual application.

== Tribology and surface design ==

Stress and loads which affect the surfaces of components are analyzed and modified for optimal functionality and performance.

== Research==
Research and development activities at the Fraunhofer IWM are organized into five business units where similar project topics are grouped together in each unit. Pools of experts with the necessary competencies to achieve the desired goal are assembled from the various groups.

=== Materials Design ===
Material behavior is explained and material properties are predicted using computational and experimental methods based on solid-state physics and materials mechanics. In this way can material structures, properties, and functions be defined. The effects of crystalline defects and microstructures on the macroscopic behavior of materials are identified, enabling the effective and efficient use of material and energy resources in order to achieve long-term improvements to technical systems.

=== Manufacturing Processes ===
A vast understanding of processes and sophisticated simulation techniques enables the design of efficient and safe manufacturing processes. Services include investigations into the technological development of manufacturing processes for the production of semi-finished products and components with functional properties. This work ranges from powder technology processes, including complex fluid systems, to microfluids, the forming and processing of ductile materials as well as processing techniques for brittle materials and glass forming.

=== Tribology ===
This business unit carries out research into friction and wear. Tribological systems are optimized and solutions are developed  that reduce friction and protect against wear with the aid of technical ceramics, innovative lubricants, tribological layer systems and tribo-materials conditioned for manufacturing technology. Friction, abrasion, running-in and wear mechanisms are investigated as they affect the tribo-chemistry of machine elements such as roller and slide bearings, cutting and forming tools or motor and gear elements. Experimental techniques, multi-scale modeling and numerical simulations as well as microstructure analysis are employed.

=== Component Safety and Lightweight Construction ===
This work is centered on the assessment of a component's safety and its fitness for purpose in terms of safety-relevant demands under operational loads. The applications range from proving the safety of power station components to confirming the fault tolerances of aerospace components, the life expectancy analysis of components in power stations and vehicles subjected to thermomechanical loads to crash analyses of vehicle components. The focus is on the operational behavior of modern materials as well as joins and hybrid constructions. Development work is also carried out on mechanism-based material models for a wide range of applications with which to describe the deformation and failure behavior of components under thermal and mechanical loads. Crash analysis increasingly involves determining the influence of the manufacturing process on the failure behavior of vehicle structures.

=== Assessment of Materials, Lifetime Concepts ===
The influence of microstructures, internal stresses and damage on component functionality and life expectancy are assessed. Particular interest is paid to linking specific analyses and experiments with advanced material models as well as in understanding the demands placed on components. The work is focused on modeling cyclical thermomechanical loads and on identifying the degradation mechanisms involved in corrosion, stress corrosion cracking and hydrogen embrittlement. In acute cases of damage, the institute can carry out surveys.

== Finances and staff ==
The operating budget is financed through external earnings and institutional funding (core funding). The operating budget for 2017 amounted to 20.3 million euro, of which 48.5% came from industry revenues. The investment budget for 2017 was 2.9 million euro.

At the end of 2017 the institute employed 225 permanent staff: 122 scientists, 42 technical staff, 65 infrastructure staff and 10 apprentices. Including the 68 academic assistants as well as interns, the Fraunhofer IWM had 293 employees in 2017.

The area was also divided into two parts: Poshtkuh and Pishkuh, in the Qajar dynasty. Today, Lorestan is the name of one of the western provinces of Iran.

== Origin ==
There are several disputes over the origin of the Lurs and they are believed to be from the Elamite and Kassite origin&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Medean or Persian tribe of Aryan origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.culturalsurvival.org/publications/cultural-survival-quarterly/iran/lurs-iran |title=The Lurs of Iran |publisher=Cultural Survival |date= |accessdate=2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, nowadays they speak an Iranian language and consider themselves as pure Iranians.
=== Name ===
The word Lur for the first time is seen in the writings of some historians and geographers of the 10th century and later in the form of اللور, اللر and لور (Lur). [[Hamdallah Mustawfi]] in [[Tarikh-i guzida|Tarikh-e gozida]] (1330 AD) referred to the settlement of Lurish tribes in Levant and then their mass migration towards the current Lurish-inhabited areas. Several hyphothesis are discussed about the origin of the name Lur or Lor. It is attributed to a person called Lur or Lohraseb and some believe that the name refers to the area of first settlement of this ethnic group. The word Ler or Lir (literally Forst or forest mountain) is a probable source for this word.&lt;ref&gt;H.Mostawfi. 2000. Tarikhe Gozide (in Persian). Amir Kabir Publications, Tehran&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early History ==
Luristan is mainly a mountainous juicy and lush area with prosperous  pasturages.  There are several dominant tree species like oak, elm, walnut and almond around Luristan.[[File:Cave painting in Doushe cave, Lorstan, Iran, 8th millennium BC.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Cave painting]] in Doushe cave, Lorestan, Iran, 8th millennium BC]]
[[File:Disc-headed pin zoom (2) Bronze Beaker Luristan 1000 BC (Rietberg museum).JPG|thumb|right|200px|Zoom of a disc-headed pin (pin, female figure). Found in Lorestan, [[Rietberg Museum]], [[Zürich]]]]
The ancient history of Lorestan is closely intertwined with the rest of the [[Ancient Near East]]. In the 3rd and 4th millennium BC, migrant tribes settled down in the mountainous area of the Zagros Mountains. The [[Kassites]], an ancient people who spoke neither an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] nor a [[Semitic languages|Semitic language]], originated in Lorestān. They would control [[Babylonia]] after the fall of the [[Old Babylonian Empire]] ca. 1531 BC and until ca. 1155 BC.
Luristan was invaded and settled by the Iranian [[Medes]] in the 2nd millennium BC. The Medes absorbed the indigenous inhabitants of the region, primarily the [[Kassites]] as well as the [[Gutians]], by the time the area was conquered by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]] in the 1st millennium BC.
In February 2017, archeological discoveries related to the [[Achaemenid]] era were made in Lorestan for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.irna.ir/en/News/82418319/ | title=Archeologist: First signs of Achaemenids discovered in Western Iran}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of Aryan settlement in Luristan, precedes more than 1000 years BC. From the Indo-European ethnic groups, first, the Medes settled in areas known as Lorestan. Between 625 and 700 BC, other tribes like the Scythians settled in Lorestan.
=== Elam ===
The first people who ruled areas of Lorestan were Elamites. The extent of the influence of the Elamites has been to the present Mamassani area. They were indigenous peoples of Iran, but there is no proper knowledge of how communities are formed and the beginning of their history. However, They were able to establish a state before the arrival of Aryan ethnic groups in parts of western Iran.&lt;ref name=loor1&gt;{{یادکرد وب| نشانی = http://loor.ir/News.asp?nid=2970&amp;ln=fa| عنوان = آیا لر آریاییست یا عیلامی و کاسی؟| تاریخ بازدید =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴| نویسنده =| تاریخ =۲۶ شهریور ۱۳۸۹| ناشر =نشریه اینترنتی مردم لر| زبان =فارسی| نشانی بایگانی = https://archive.today/Waga| تاریخ بایگانی =۱۳ سپتامبر ۲۰۱۴}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Elam government included Khuzestan, modern Lorestan, Poshtkuh (Ilam provice and some western Iraqi areas), Bakhtiari mountains and Southern Lurish settelment. Babylonians called the land of Elamites Elam or Elamto, meaning "the mountain" and perhaps "the land of sunrise".
Elamite is generally accepted to be a [[language isolate]] and thus unrelated to the much later arriving Persian and Iranic languages. In accordance to geographical and archaeological matching, historians argue that the Elamites to be the Proto-[[Lurs]], whose language became [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] only in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Edwards|first= I.E.S.|last2= Gadd| first2= C.J.|last3= Hammond|first3= G.L.|title=The Cambridge Ancient History|year=1971|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521077910|page=644|url=https://books.google.com/?id=slR7SFScEnwC&amp;dq=elamite+lurs}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Potts|first= D.S|title=The Archaeology of Elam: Formation and Transformation of an Ancient Iranian State (Cambridge World Archaeology)|year=1999|edition=2nd|publisher= Camberidge University Press|isbn=9780521564960|page=45|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mc4cfzkRVj4C&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=proto-lurs+elamite#v=onepage&amp;q=proto-lurs%20elamite&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grugni&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grugni | first1 = V | last2 = Battaglia | first2 = V | last3 = Hooshiar Kashani | first3 = B | last4 = Parolo | first4 = S | last5 = Al-Zahery | first5 = N ''et al.

==== Elamite cities ====
The major cities of the Elamites were Shush, Ahvaz, Madakto and Kheidalou. [[Walther Hinz]] believes that the current KhorramAbad in the era of the Elamites was the capital of a dynasty called Simashki.
In the course of several thousand years, the Elamites maintained their identity against strong tribes such as [[Sumer]]ians, [[Akkadians]], [[Babylonians]], and [[Assyrians]].
Eventually, they were defeated by their enemy of Assyria in 654 BC because of internal disputes and wars.
The rise of the Elamites and the formation of the Elamite government in the north of Khuzestan plain is the most important political event of Iran in the third millennium BC. Since then, before the arrival of the Medes and Persians, what we know from the history of the land of Iran is only the political history of Elamite.

=== Kassites ===
Kassites entered to the Iranian plateau from the highlands of the Caucasus and Azerbaijan before the Aryan migration and then settled  the southwest of Iran. Kassites along with Elam, dominated parts of Lorestan and had an extraordinary skill in making bronze artifacts. They were considered as the most important Zagros mountain tribes and were engaged to livestock breeding. They spoke in a language that was affiliated with Elamite.
They were brave and warrior riders and repeatedly entered into battle with their neighbors, including Elamites and Babylonians. They even managed to overthrow the government of Babylon and ruled theBabylon for six centuries. The rule of the Kassites in Babylonia ended as a result of their defeat from the Elamites. After the defeat from the Elamites, they returned to their mountainous land of Lorestan.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://pardis.150m.com/kassi572.pdf |عنوان =قوم کاسی | ناشر =مهدی رازانی |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۳ آذر ۱۳۹۱}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =گرانتوسگی |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از زمان باستان تا امروز| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۴۵}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد|نویسنده =پیگولووسکایا |کتاب =تاریخ ایران از عهد باستان تا قرن ۱۸| ناشر = تهران |صفحه = |تاریخ =۱۳۵۳}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Achaemenids to Sassanids ===
During the rule of Achaemenid, Lorestan was part of the rule of the Kassites and when the Achaemenids moved from Babylon to Hamadan, they had to cross the Lorestan area and pay ransom to the Kassites.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=4454 |عنوان =جبال (۱) (جمع جَبَل) یا کورة جَبَل یا قُهِستان یا قوهستان (معرّب کوهستان) یا بلاد جبال | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pahle was the name of a vast land in west of Iran which was included many cities and areas in the current Zagros. The province of Pahla was named after the Sasanian times and the word Pahlavi refers to the people, the language, and the alphabet related to the this region. At the time of the Achaemenids, the current Lorestan, along with Ilam and Khuzestan, were the third state of this great empire. During the Parthian period, this land was one of the Satraps (states) of this dynasty anf finally, during the Sassanid period, the area was named "Pahla".&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.encyclopaediaislamica.com/madkhal2.php?sid=2899 |عنوان =پَهلَوی | ناشر =دانشنامه جهان اسلام |تاریخ = |تاریخ بازدید =۱ ژوئن ۲۰۱۱|زبان=فارسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;
== Islamic era ==
In spite of several resistance efforts, the Arab conquest of Iran, led to the end of the Sasanid Empire in 651 and the eventual decline of the Zoroastrian religion in Iran. Iran (including Lurish territory) was under the absolute sovereignty of Arabs for two centuries. Lur people, however, managed to maintain the language and many of their customs. Until the end of the third century AH, the district of Lorestan paid the taxes to Kufa and was directly governed by the Caliphs. Different free-seeking revolts led to gradual reestablishment of Iranian local dynasties in the beginning of the ninth century.
After the Arab dominance, Luristan was under control of [[Hasanwayhids]], [[Buyids]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuqids]], respectively.

By the middle of the tenth century, the total Lurish-inhabited areas were known as Luristan. Along with the gradual weakening of Seljuks, several autonomous atabeg were formed across Iran. Luristan Atabegs or Hazaraspids established an autonomous state in the Lurish-inhabited areas. After that, the territory was divided into two parts: Lur-e-kuchek (Minor Luristan) and Lur-e-bozorg (Major Luristan). The former corresponded to modern Luristan and Ilam provinces and some areas in the current western Iraq while the latter included modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluye-Boir Ahmed, Mamasani and some coastal areas in Bushehr. In spite of all these invasions, the Lurs maintained their territorial integrity, absorbed the invaders, and eventually established two local dynasties known as Atabak or Atabeg during the twelfth century.
Hazaraspids (Atabaks of Luristan) is the name of Lur dynasty that ruled a large area of Iran for a long while (1148–1424). Their territory included almost all the current Lurish-inhabited regions. Luristan Atabeg then divided in two Atabegs; the Minor Luristan (Lore kučak) and the Major Luristan (Lore bozorg) with Khorram Abad and Idaj as their capitals, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{یادکرد وب|نویسنده = |نشانی =http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/hazaraspids |عنوان =هزاراسپیان | ناشر =دانشنامه ایرانیکا |تاریخ  = |تاریخ بازدید =‎۶ آبان ۱۳۸۹|زبان=انگلیسی}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lor-e-Bozorg (Major Luristan) ===
A big  part of the Lurish areas came under the control of a local dynasty known as Lur-e bozorg Atabegs during the twelfth century. It was established in 1155 AD. The area under the control of major Luristan rulers (modern Bakhtiari, Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmed, Mamasani and parts of Khuzistan, Bushehr and Isfahan provinces) was included a vast territory extending from the Dez River in the north Khuzistan to the central areas of [[Fars province|Fars]] in the southern Iran. In spite of evidences indicating the economic and social proserity, the Atabak dynasty finally extinct by [[Ibrahim Sultan ibn Shahrukh]] invasion in 1423. As a result, the territorial unity and the economic prosperity of the Major Luristan was terminated. The territory was divided into tribal sectins without a centralized coherence. During the Safavid period (1501–1750), Major Luristan was divided into three parts: the northern part became known as [[Bkhtiari people|Bakhtiari]], the central part as [[Kuhgiluyeh and Boyer Ahmad|Kuhgilu]], and the southern part as [[Mamasani County|Mamasani]].

=== Lor-e-Kuchek (Minor Luristan) ===
Traditionally the Minor Luristan corresponded to current provinces of Luristan and Ilam and some Feyli-inhabited areas in Iraq (belt of mountainous region stretching from the plains of the Tigris in the west to the Diz River in the east).Shojaeddin Khorshid establshed the dynasty as the Atabakan-i-Luristan, which lasted from 1184 to 1597. The rulers established their capital in Khorramabad (currently the provincial capital of [[Luristan province]].

==== Lurish Walies dynasty ====
The Atabak dynasty was replaced by the Wali dynasty (1596–1929). The founder of the new dynasty was Husain Khan, whose father had married the aunt of the last Atabak, and on the basis of this kinship tie Husain Khan later received the position of ruler of Lur-j-kuchek. The Walis played a significant role in the political affairs of Iran. They guarded southwestern Iran against the Ottomans, who constantly attacked the western and southwestern borders of the country. Ali Mardan Khan was appointed the commander-in-chief of the entire Iranian armed forces dur downfall of the Safavids, when the country was invaded by the Afghans in the early eighteenth century (De Bode 1845).

The reign of the Walis coincided with several dynasties of Iran including: Safavid (1501–1736), Afshar (1736–1750), Zand (1750–1794), Qajar (1796–1925) and the beginning of the Pahlavi(1924–1929). The last two dynasties, namely the Qajar and Pahlavi, are responsible for the political weakness of the Lurs and the decline of the Wali dynasty. Thus, the Lurs maintained their political integrity under the Safavids and Afshars, while they ruled over Iran during the Zand dynasty. However, when the Qajars came to power, they divided Lur-i-kuchek into two parts, Luristan and Posht-kuh. From this time on, the domain of the Walis was limited to Posht-kuh only, while Luristan came under the direct control of the central government. Thus, a governor-general, usually a member of the royal family, was appointed by the king and sent to Luristan. Yet during the Qajar dynasty, Luristan was continually in a state of anarchy. The Qajars were unable to subdue the tribes of Luristan and hence, except for some short periods, there was no peace in Luristan. As a matter of fact, the Qajar dynasty lost total control over Luristan after the assassination of Nasir al-Din Shah in 1896. In short, the division of Lur-i-kuchek by the Qajar dynasty weakened the political strength of the Walis and reduced the Lurs' political influence. Furthermore, the inability of the Qajars to establish law and order in Luristan contributed to the expansion of pastoral nomadism and the destruction of settled communities. Consequently, Luristan suffered politically as well as economically under Qajar rule.

The Qajar dynasty was overthrown by Reza Khan, the founder of the Pahlavi dynasty, in 1925. The Pahlavi dynasty (1925–1979) is best characterized as a dictatorial monarchy with absolute rule, that is, the concentration of power in the monarch's hands. The regime built an army whose strength was without precedent in the history of Iran. The army was used against Lurs and other groups who refused to give up their power to the new regime. Through bloody confrontations between the new monarch and the Lurs (as well as other peoples in Iran), the Pahlavi dynasty eventually crushed the powers of the Lurs. Thus, Reza Shah ended the Wali dynasty of Posht-kuh, executed or exiled many of the Lur leaders, forcefully sedentarized the nomadic pastoral tribes and changed the territorial integrity of Lur-i-kuchek.

== Modern history ==
=== The Lurs under the Pahlavi Regime ===

While the Qajar dynasty was responsible for the spread of anarchy among the Lurs, the Pahlavi-dynasty was responsible for their political disorganization, social disruption and the loss of political freedom and semi-independent status. For the first time in their long history, the Lurs were stripped of their traditional rights and political freedom by the Pahlavi dynasty. When Reza Shah took power, he established a centralized government, transferring power from the provincial communities to Tehran. He carried out his plan through the use of military operations against various provincial communities, including the Lurs. A key element to Reza Shah's success was that the Lurs were not unified so he could attack each group separately. Furthermore, Reza Shah used one tribe to fight against another. As the Lurs were defeated, Reza Shah took the following measures to keep them under control: 1) tribal leaders were removed from their positions of authority and were replaced by military officials, 2) many of the leaders, were executed, imprisoned or exiled to other parts of Iran, 3) some tribes were exiled to distant lands, 4) all pastoral nomadic tribes, which formed the majority of the Lur population, were forceably sedentarized without sufficient provisions, 5) all tribesmen were disarmed, 6) the use of the traditional black tent was outlawed, 7) tribesmen were ordered to abandon their traditional costume and were forced to wear Western clothes; however, this rule was not totally carried out, and 8) governmental offices were established in order to carry out the state policies.

The above policies were intended to subjugate the Lurs to the central government. Reza Shah altered the traditional sociopolitical organization of the Lurs without providing opportunities for their participation in local or national government. Undoubtedly the establishment of the central state demanded the integration of various regions and ethnic groups. However, that need not entail political deprivation and the lack of respect for members of the different tribal or ethnic groups. Under the Pahlavi regime, however, the establishment of the modern state came to mean precisely that – the expansion of state domination and disruption of the traditional political organization without the slightest opportunity for peoples to participate in local or national politics.

Reza Shah was deposed by the British and Russians in 1941, and was replaced by his son Mohammed Reza Shah, who ruled from 1941 to 1979. The reign of Mohammed Reza Shah witnessed further centralization of state power and the disintegration of traditional political organization among the Lurs. The enforcement of the land reform program and the nationalization of the forests and pastureland (1962–63 along with various forces of modernization including the expansion of capitalism, urbanism and modern schooling gradually changed many aspects of the Lurs' culture.

Under the Pahlavi regime, the Lurs lost their freedom and their semi-independent status, and the Lurs' territories were divided into several administrative units without any regard for traditional boundaries. For instance, Lur-i-kuchek has been limited to modern Luristan while Posht-kuh, formerly ruled by the Wali dynasty, was incorporated into Ilam province. The most dramatic change caused by the Pahlavi regime was the loss of freedom and the semi-independent status of the Lurs. Prior to the establishment of the Pahlavi Regime, basic decisions were made within the local communities. For instance, the Bakhtiari was ruled by a local dynasty who paid certain tributes to the central government, while internal affairs were taken care of by the members of that dynasty. In Luristan, each tribal group acted as a semi-independent unit. In Posht-kuh, the Walis were supreme, while the tribes of Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed and those of Mamasani also enjoyed the same internal freedom. The Pahlavi regime, however, sent high-ranking officials from Tehran to supervise the Lur territories. Just prior to the recent revolution, all governors-general were directly appointed by the Shah without taking into consideration the existence of the Lurs' communities. Lurs, like other Iranians, were prohibited from organizing political parties, forming associations or expressing themselves through mass media and public gatherings.

Second, Iranian oil is extracted from the mountain slopes of Luristan, Bakhtiari and Kuh-Gilu-Boir Ahmed provinces, but the Lurs were deprived from their share of oil revenue, particularly during the reign of Mohammed Reza Shah. The money derived from oil went to the pockets of the Tehranis, creating regional economic inequalities.

Third, despite the fact that the Pahlavi regime provided elementary and, to some extent, secondary education for the Lurs, it failed to provide them with opportunities for higher education. Until a few years prior to the revolution, not a single institution of higher education was established among the Lurs, nor were they given scholarships or financial support. The Pahlavi regime was thus responsible for depriving the Lurs of access to higher and prestigious positions. High-ranking Lur families were the only exceptions; they could afford to send their children to universities either in Iran or outside the country.

Modern education was used during the Pahlavi rule as a way to undermine local cultural values. School curriculum was prepared in Tehran without taking the cultural diversity among the Iranian peoples into consideration. Not a single course in the entire elementary, high school or university curricula reflected the history, geography or sociocultural values of the Lurs.

In sum, the Lurs lost their sociopolitical integrity under the Pahlavi dynasty. They were integrated into the "modern" state without any opportunity for effective participation in the decision-making process that affected their lives.

=== The Lurs under the Islamic Regime ===

It is too early to evaluate the sociopolitical conditions of the Lurs under the present regime. So far, political parties, associations and local newspapers have not yet emerged. Administrative boundaries of the Lurs' territories remain unchanged from those of the Pahlavi regime. While it is difficult to speculate about the future of the Lurs under the current regime, considering the fact that the present regime is concerned more with an Islamic community rather than with a country of diverse ethnic groups, it seems unlikely that there will be considerable change in the near future.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26894">The '''Hurufiyya movement''' ({{lang-ar|حروفية}} ''hurufiyya'', adjective form ''hurufi'' literal meaning "letters" [of the alphabet]) was an aesthetic movement that emerged in the late twentieth century amongst [[Arabian]] and North African artists, who used their understanding of traditional [[Islamic calligraphy]], within the precepts of [[modern art]]. By combining tradition and modernity, these artists worked towards developing a Pan-Arab visual language, which instilled a sense of national identity in their respective nation states, at a time when many of these states where shaking off colonial rule and asserting their independence. They adopted the same name as the [[Hurufi]], an approach of [[Sufism]] which emerged in the late 14th–early 15th century. Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab art world in the 20th-century. 

==Definition==
The term, ''hurifiyya'' is derived from the Arabic term, ''harf'' which means letter (as in a letter of the alphabet). When the term is used to describe an contemporary art movement, it explicitly references a Medieval system of teaching involving political theology and lettrism. In this theology, letters were seen as primordial signifiers and manipulators of the cosmos.&lt;ref&gt;Mir-Kasimov, O., ''Words of Power: Hurufi Teachings Between Shi'ism and Sufism in Medieval Islam,'' I.B. Tauris and the Institute of Ismaili Studies, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the term is charged with Sufi intellectual and esoteric meaning. &lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, pp 1294-95; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

The hurufiyya art movement (also known as the ''Al-hurufiyyah movement''&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; or the ''Letrism movement''&lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;) refers to the use of calligraphy as a graphic element within an artwork, typically an abstract work.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:] ;Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The pan-Arab hurufiyya art movement is distinct from the [[Letterist International]] which had an Algerian section founded in [[Chlef]] in 1953 by [[Hadj Mohamed Dahou]]. 

The term, ''hurufiyya'' has become somewhat controversial and has been rejected by a number of scholars, including [[Wijdan Ali]], Nada Shabout and Karen  Dabrowska. An alternative term, ''al-Madrassa al-Khattiya Fil-Fann'' [Calligraphic School of Art] has been proposed to describe the experimental use of calligraphy in modern Arabic art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p.80; Shabout, N., "Huroufiyah" in: ''Routledge Encyclopedia Of Modern Art,'' Routledge, 2016,  DOI: 10.4324/9781135000356-REM176-1; Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 166-67&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brief history and philosophy==
[[File:Amir Khusraw Dihlavi - An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''An Old Sufi Laments His Lost Youth,'' page from a Sufi manuscript, 13th century. Sufi art served as part of the inspiration for the al-hurufiyya movement.]]
Traditional hurufi art was bound by strict rules, which amongst other things, confined calligraphy to devotional works and prohibited the representation of humans in manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt; Schimmel,  A., ''Calligraphy and Islamic Culture,'' London, I.B. Taurus, 1990, pp 31-32&lt;/ref&gt; Practising calligraphers trained with a master for many years in order to learn both the technique and the rules governing calligraphy. Contemporary hurufiyya artists broke free from these rules, allowing Arabic letters to be deconstructed, altered and included in abstract artworks.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  

The use of traditional Arabic elements, notably, calligraphy, in modern art arose independently in various Islamic states; few of these artists working in this area, had knowledge of each other, allowing for different manifestations of hurufiyya to develop in different regions. &lt;ref&gt;Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, [https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006 DOI:]; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt; In Sudan, for instance, the movement was known as the ''Old Khartoum School'',&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; and assumed a distinctive character in which both African motifs and calligraphy were combined, while media such as leather and wood replaced canvas to provide a distinct African style.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1298-1299; Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Morocco, the movement was accompanied by the replacement of traditional media for oils; artists favoured traditional dyes such as henna, and embraced weaving, jewellery and tattoo as well as including traditional Berber motifs.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; In Jordan, it was generally known as the ''al-hurufiyyah'' movement, while in Iran, the [[Iranian modern and contemporary art#Saqqakhaneh movement|Saqqa-Khaneh movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have suggested that [[Madiha Omar]], who was active in the US and Baghdad from the mid-1940s, was the pioneer of the movement, since she was the first to explore the use of Arabic script in a contemporary art context in the 1940s and exhibited hurufiyya-inspired works in Washington in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  pp 115-119&lt;/ref&gt; However, other scholars have suggested that she was a ''precursor'' to Hurufiyya&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Madiha Omar," [Biographical Notes], [https://www.meemartgallery.com/art_resources.php?id=89 Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;. Yet other scholars have suggested that the hurufiyya art movement probably began in North Africa, in the area around Sudan, with the work of [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]],&lt;ref&gt;Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:];Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56; Dadi. I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly,'' 109 (3), 2010 pp 555-576, DOI:https://doi.org/10.121500382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; who initially explored Coptic manuscripts,  a step that led him to experiment with Arabic calligraphy.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; It is clear that by the early 1950s, a number of artists in different countries were experimenting with works based on calligraphy, including the Iraqi painter and sculptor, [[Jamil Hamoudi]] who experimented with the graphic possibilities of using Arabic characters, as early as 1947;&lt;ref&gt;Inati, S.C., ''Iraq: Its History, People, and Politics,'' Humanity Books, 2003, p.76; Beaugé, F. and Clément, J-F., ''L'image dans le Monde Arabé,''CNRS Éditions, 1995, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Iranian painters, Nasser Assar (b. 1928) ([[:fr:Nasser Assar]]) and [[Hossein Zenderoudi]], who won a prize at the 1958 Paris Biennale.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Hurufiyya artists rejected Western art concepts, and instead grappled with a new artistic identity drawn from within their own culture and heritage. These artists successfully integrated Islamic visual traditions, especially calligraphy, into contemporary, indigenous compositions. &lt;ref&gt;Lindgren, A. and Ross, S., ''The Modernist World,'' Routledge, 2015, p. 495; Mavrakis, N., "The Hurufiyah Art Movement in Middle Eastern Art," ''McGill Journal of Middle Eastern Studies Blog,'' [https://mjmes.wordpress.com/2013/03/08/article-5/ Online:]; Tuohy, A. and Masters, C., ''A-Z Great Modern Artists,'' Hachette UK, 2015, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; The common theme amongst hurufiyya artists is that they all tapped into the beauty and mysticism of Arabic calligraphy, but used it in a modern, abstract sense. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press, 2017, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; Although hurufiyya artists struggled to find their own individual dialogue with nationalism, they also worked towards a broader aesthetic that transcended national boundaries and represented an affiliation with an Arab identity in the post-colonial period.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds) ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294&lt;/ref&gt;

The art historian, Christiane Treichl, explains how calligraphy is used in contemporary art:&lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; 
: "They deconstruct writing, exploit the letter and turn it into an indexical sign of calligraphy, tradition and cultural heritage. As the sign is purely aesthetic, and only linguistic in its cultural association, it opens hitherto untravelled avenues for interpretation, and attracts different audiences, yet still maintains a link to the respective artist's own culture... Hurufiyya artists do away with the signifying function of language. The characters become pure signs, and temporarily emptied of their referential meaning, they become available for new meanings."  

The hurufiyya art movement was not confined to painters, but also included important ceramicists such as the Jordanian, [[Mahmoud Taha]], who combined traditional aesthetics, including calligraphy, with skilled craftsmanship,&lt;ref&gt;Asfour, M., "A Window on Contemporary Arab Art," NABAD Art Gallery, Online: http://www.nabadartgallery.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and sculptors, such as the Qatari, [[Yousef Ahmad]]&lt;ref&gt;Anima Gallery, "Yousef Ahdmad," [Biographical Notes], [http://www.animagallery.com/artists/yousef-ahmad/ Online:]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iraqi sculptors, [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. Nor, was the movement organised along formal lines across the Arab-speaking nations. In some Arab nations, hurufiyya artists formed formal groups or societies, such as Iraq's ''Al Bu'd al Wahad'' (or the [[One Dimension Group]])" which published a manifesto,&lt;ref&gt;"Shaker Hassan Al Said," Darat al Funum, Online: www.daratalfunun.org/main/activit/curentl/anniv/exhib3.html; Flood, F.B. and Necipoglu, G. (eds), ''A Companion to Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Wiley, 2017, p. 1294 &lt;/ref&gt; while in other nations artists working independently in the same city had no knowledge of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, pp 165-66; Dadi, I., "Ibrahim El Salahi and Calligraphic Modernism in a Comparative Perspective," ''South Atlantic Quarterly. '' Vol. 109, No. 3, 2010, pp 555-576, DOI: 10.1215/00382876-2010-006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Art historian, Dagher, has described hurufiyya as the most important movement to emerge in the Arab world in the 20th-century. &lt;ref name="Dagher"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dagher|first1=Charles|last2=Mahmoud|first2=Samir|title=Arabic Hurufiyya: Art and Identity|date=2016|publisher=Skira Editore|location=Milan|isbn=978-8857231518}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' while acknowledging its importance in terms of encouraging Arab nationalism, describes hurufiyya as neither "a movement nor a school." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of hurufiyya===
[[File:نصب أشعار بغداد.jpg|thumb|''[[Ashaar Baghdad (monument)|Ashaar Baghdad]]'' (Baghdad's poetry) by [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. In this fountain, Arabic words taken from a poem by Mustafa Jamal El Din have been squeezed together to form the oval shape in an example of Asbract calligraphy.]]

Art historians have identified three generations of hurufiyya artists: &lt;ref&gt;Issa, R., Cestar. J. and Porter,V., ''Signs of Our Times: From Calligraphy to Calligraffiti,''New York, Merrill, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

: ''First generation'': The pioneers, who inspired by the independence of their nations, searched for a new aesthetic language that would allow them to express their nationalism. These artists rejected European techniques and media, turning to indigenous media and introducing Arabic calligraphy into their art. For this group of artists, Arabic letters are a central feature of the artwork. First generation artists include: the Jordanian artist, [[Wijdan Ali|Princess Wijdan Ali]], the Sudanese artist, [[Ibrahim el-Salahi]]; the Iraqi artists, [[Shakir Hassan Al Said|Shakkir Hassan Al Sa'id]], [[Jamil Hamoudi]] and [[Jawad Saleem]]; the Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]] and the Egyptian artist, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926).  

: ''Second generation'': Artists, most of whom live in exile, but reference their traditions, culture and language in their artworks. The artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is typical of this generation.

: ''Third generation'':  Contemporary artists who have absorbed international aesthetics, and who employ Arabic and Persian script occasionally. They deconstruct the letters, and use them in a purely abstract and decorative manner. The work of [[Golnaz Fathi]] and [[Lalla Essaydi]] is representative of the third generation.

==Types of hurufiyya art==
Hurufiyya art involved a very diverse range of "explorations into the abstract, graphic, and aesthetic properties of Arabic letters." &lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, D.F., ''The Cambridge Companion to Modern Arab Culture,'' Cambridge University Press, 2015, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; Art historians, including Wijdan Ali and Shirbil Daghir, have attempted to develop a way of classifying different types of hurufiyya art.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, pp 79-85&lt;/ref&gt; Ali identifies the following, which she describes as ''schools'' within the ''movement'': &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165; It should be noted that Daghir uses a different classification, not canvassed here.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Pure calligraphy
: Artworks in which calligraphy forms both the background and the foreground. &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
; Neoclassical
: Works that adhere to the rules of 13th-century calligraphy. An example of this is the work of [[Khairat Al-Saleh]] (b. 1940) &lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dia-Al-Azzawi-Portrait-Picture.jpg|thumb|Artist, Dia-Al-Azzawi, exhibits the style of the Calligraphy Combinations School of Hurufiyya art]]
; Modern classical
: Works that blend pure calligraphy with other motifs, such as repeating geometric patterns. Ahmad Moustaffa (b. 1943) is representative of this style&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 165-66&lt;/ref&gt;
;[[Calligraffiti]]  
: Artwork, employing script, but which follows no rules and where artists require no formal training. Calligraffiti artists employ their own ordinary handwriting within a modern composition. Artists may reshape letters, or simply invent new letters that reference traditional Arabic scripts. Artists that belong to this school include: Lebanese painter and poet, [[Etel Adnan]]; Egyptian painter, Ramzi Moustafa (b. 1926) and the Iraqi artist and intellectual. [[Shakir Hassan Al Said]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 167-69&lt;/ref&gt;
; Freeform calligraphy
: Artworks that balance classical styles with calligraffiti.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt;
; Abstract calligraphy
: Art that deconstructs letters and includes them as a graphic element in an abstract artwork. In this style of art, letters may be legible, illegible or may use pseudo-script. Rafa al-Naisiri (b. 1940) and [[Mahmoud Hammad]] (1923-1988) are notable examples of this style of artist.&lt;ref&gt;Ali, W., ''Modern Islamic Art: Development and Continuity,'' University of Florida Press, 1997, p. 170-172&lt;/ref&gt;
; Calligraphy Combinations
: Artworks that use any combination of calligraphy styles, often employing marginal calligraphy or unconscious calligraphy. Artist, [[Dia Azzawi]] is a representative of this style.&lt;ref&gt;Shabout, N.M., ''Modern Arab Art: Formation of Arab Aesthetics,'' University of Florida Press, 2007, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable exponents==

Iraqi painter, [[Madiha Omar]], is recognised as a pioneer of the hurufiyaa art movement, having exhibited a number of hurufist-inspired works in Georgetown in Washington as early as 1949. &lt;ref&gt;Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; and publishing ''Arabic Calligraphy: An Inspiring Element in Abstract Art'' in 1950.&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexandria exhibition celebrates 'Hurufiyya' art movement - Visual Art - Arts &amp; Culture - Ahram Online|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/5/25/253331/Arts--Culture/Visual-Art/Alexandria-exhibition-celebrates-Hurufiyya-art-mov.aspx|website=english.ahram.org.eg|accessdate=18 February 2018|language=en}}; Treichl, C., ''Art and Language: Explorations in (Post) Modern Thought and Visual Culture,'' Kassel University Press,  2017  p. 117&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jamil Hamoudi]] was also a pioneer, active from the 1950s.

The '''''International Art Markets''''', subtitled '''''The Essential Guide for Collectors and Investors''''', is a book, compiled and edited by James Goodwin. 

In 42 country art market chapters, plus one regional chapter, the book's aim is to detail the multitude of influences on each country’s art market for the benefit of new or existing [[art collector]]s and [[investor]]s. The book includes chapters on 21 countries from [[Europe]], 12 from [[Asia]] and [[Australasia]], five from [[South America]], four from the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], and two from [[North America]].

Written by 58 mostly locally based experts from the art trade, each chapter provides  an introduction to the art market; a summary of each individual market and their history; market structure and performance, including artists, dealers, [[auctioneer]]s, [[Art exhibition|fairs]], [[trade association]]s, [[museum]]s, exhibitions, and education; and tax and regulation.
==Author==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6015">'''Kinesics''' is the interpretation of body motion communication such as [[facial expression]]s and [[gesture]]s, nonverbal behavior related to movement of any part of the body or the body as a whole. The equivalent popular culture term is [[body language]], a term [[Ray Birdwhistell]], considered the founder of this area of study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Danesi|first1=M|title=Kinesics|journal=Encyclopedia of Language &amp; Linguistics|date=2006|pages=207–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; neither used nor liked (on the grounds that what can be conveyed with the body does not meet the linguist's definition of language).

==Birdwhistell's work==
Kinesics was first used in 1952 by an [[anthropology|anthropologist]] named [[Ray Birdwhistell]]. Birdwhistell wished to study how people communicate through posture, gesture, stance and movement.&lt;ref&gt;Birdwhistell, R. L. (1952). Introduction to ''Kinesics: An Annotation System for Analysis of Body Motion and Gesture''. Washington, DC: Department of State, Foreign Service Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas over several decades were synthesized and resulted in the book ''Kinesics and Context.''&lt;ref&gt;Birdwhistell, R. 1970. ''Kinesics and Context''. University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia.&lt;/ref&gt; Interest in kinesics specifically and nonverbal behavior generally was popularized in the late 1960s and early 1970s by such popular mass market (nonacademic) publications as ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''.&lt;ref&gt;Nierenberg, G. I., &amp; Calero, H. H. (1971). ''How to Read a Person Like a Book''. New York: Hawthorn Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Part of Birdwhistell's work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show elements of communication that were not clearly seen otherwise. One of his most important projects was ''The Natural History of an Interview,'' a long-term interdisciplinary collaboration including [[Gregory Bateson]], [[Frieda Fromm-Reichmann]], Norman A. McQuown, Henry W. Brosin and others.&lt;ref&gt;Jump up ^ Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (1987). The Social History of The Natural History of an Interview: A multidisciplinary investigation of social communication. ''Research on Language and Social Interaction'', 20, 1-51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing heavily on [[descriptive linguistics]], Birdwhistell argued that all movements of the body have meaning and that nonverbal behavior has a [[grammar]] that can be analyzed in similar terms to spoken language. Thus, a "kineme" is "similar to a [[phoneme]] because it consists of a group of movements which are not identical, but which may be used interchangeably without affecting social meaning."&lt;ref&gt;Knapp, M. 1972. ''Nonverbal Communication in Human Interaction''. Reinhart and Winston, New York, pp. 94-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Birdwhistell estimated that no more than 30 to 35 percent of the social meaning of a conversation or an interaction is carried by the words.&lt;ref&gt;McDermott, R. 1980. Profile: Ray L. Birdwhistell. ''The Kinesis Report'', 2, 3: 1-16.&lt;/ref&gt; He also concluded that there were no universals in these kinesic displays, a claim that was disputed by [[Paul Ekman]], who was interested in analysis of universals, especially in [[facial expression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= P|last2= Friesen|first2= W|year= 1971|title= Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal= Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume= 17|issue= 2|pages=124–9 |url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|pmid= 5542557|doi= 10.1037/h0030377}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern applications==
In a current application, kinesic behaviors are sometimes used as signs of [[deception]] by interviewers looking for clusters of movements to determine the veracity of the statement being uttered, although kinesics can be equally applied in any context and type of setting to construe innocuous messages whose carriers are indolent or unable to express verbally.

Relevant concepts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Ekman|first1= Paul|year= 2004|title= Emotional and conversational nonverbal signals|journal= Language, knowledge, and representation|pages=39–50 |url= http://eclass.uoa.gr/modules/document/file.php/PHS120/%CE%A3%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%BA%CE%AF%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7%20%CE%BA%CE%B1%CE%B9%20%CE%9D%CF%8C%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7_2015/Ekman%20vs%20Russell/Ekman_Basic-Emotions.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
*'''Emblems''' - Body movements or gestures that are directly translatable into a word or phrase
*'''Illustrators''' - Accompany or reinforce verbal messages
**Batons - Temporally accent or emphasize words or phrases
**[[Ideogram|Ideographs]] - Trace the paths of mental journeys
**Deitic movements - Point to a present object
**Kinetographs - Depict a bodily action
**Spatial movements - Depict a spacial relationship
**[[Pictogram|Pictographs]] - Draw a picture of their referent
**Rhythmic movements - Depict the rhythm or pacing of an event
*'''Affect Displays''' - Show emotion
*'''Regulators''' - Control the flow and pace of communication
*'''Manipulators''' - Release physical or emotional tension

Kinesic behaviors are an important part of [[nonverbal communication]]. Body movements convey information, but interpretations vary by culture. As many movements are carried out at a subconscious or at least a low-awareness level, kinesic movements carry a significant risk of being misinterpreted in an intercultural communication situation.

'''Linguistic diversity index''' ('''LDI''') may refer to either [[Joseph Greenberg|Greenberg’s]] (language) Diversity Index&lt;ref name="greenberg1956"&gt;{{cite journal | jstor=410659 | title=The Measurement of Linguistic Diversity | journal=Language | year=1956 | volume=32 | issue=1 | pages=109–115 | last=Greenberg | first=Joseph H. | doi=10.2307/410659}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the related Index of Linguistic Diversity (ILD) from [[Terralingua]], which measures changes in the underlying LDI over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=97–151 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greenberg's Diversity Index (LDI) is the probability that two people selected from the population at random will have different mother tongues; it therefore ranges from 0 (everyone has the same mother tongue) to 1 (no two people have the same mother tongue).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ethno_docs/distribution.asp?by=country |title=Summary by country |publisher=Ethnologue |date=1999-02-19 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ILD measures how the LDI has changed over time; a global ILD of 0.8 indicates a 20% loss of diversity since 1970, but ratios above 1 are possible, and have appeared in regional indexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Harmon |first=David |last2=Loh |first2=Jonathan |date=2010 |title=The Index of Linguistic Diversity: A New Quantitative Measure of Trends in the Status of the World’s Languages |url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4474/harmonloh.pdf |journal=Language Documentation and Conservation |volume=4 |pages=106–107 |archivedate=18 November 2014 |archiveurl=http://hdl.handle.net/10125/4474| publisher=http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computation of the diversity index is based on the population of each language as a proportion of the total population.  The index cannot fully account for the vitality of languages.  Also, the distinction between a language and a [[dialect]] is fluid and often political. A great number of languages are considered to be dialects of another language by some experts and separate languages by others.  The index does not consider how different the languages are from each other, nor does it account for second language usage; it considers only the total number of distinct languages, and their relative frequency as mother tongues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terralingua.org/linguisticdiversity/overview/ |title=overview of Linguistic Diversity |publisher=terralingua.org |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5134">A '''musicologist''' is someone who studies music (see [[musicology]]). A '''historical musicologist''' studies music from a historical perspective. An '''ethnomusicologist''' studies music in its cultural and social contexts (see [[ethnomusicology]]). A '''systematic musicologist''' asks general questions about music from the perspective of relevant disciplines (psychology, sociology, acoustics, philosophy, physiology, computer science) (see [[systematic musicology]]). Systematic musicologists often identify more strongly with their non-musical discipline than with musicology.

The '''Maritime College of Forest Technology''' (French: '''Collège de Technologie forestière des Maritimes''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] post-secondary college with campuses located in [[Fredericton]], [[New Brunswick]] (English instruction) and [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]], [[New Brunswick]] (French instruction).

==History==

The Maritime College of Forest Technology (MCFT), formerly the Maritime Forest Ranger School (MFRS), in Fredericton, New Brunswick was established in April 1946, as a co-operative effort of the provincial governments of [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]], and the wood-using industries of the two provinces. The MCFT fulfils a regional mandate.&lt;ref&gt;Supporting the contribution of Higher Education Institutions to Regional Development within Atlantic Canada by Dr. Wade Locke. The Harris Centre. Memorial University of Newfoundland. December, 2006. Accessed 11 May 2015 at https://www.mun.ca/harriscentre/reports/arf/2006/FinalReportEduRegDevelLocke.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The original location for MFRS was on the grounds owned by the [[University of New Brunswick]] which housed Alexander College and is known today as the Fredericton Exhibition Grounds. In 1949 MFRS moved to its new location overlooking the [[Saint John River (Bay of Fundy)|Saint John River Valley]]; at that time MFRS was the sole occupant of the land until the new campus was constructed in 1986. The current campus is part of the Hugh John Flemming Forestry Centre and is shared with the [[Canadian Forest Service]] and [[Natural Resources Canada|Department of Natural Resources]]. Present facilities at the Fredericton Campus were completed in 1986. The francophone campus in [[Bathurst, New Brunswick|Bathurst]] was established in 1980 and the campus is shared with the [[Collège communautaire du Nouveau-Brunswick]].

From 1946 to 2003 the college was known as the Maritime Forest Ranger School and its curriculum was one year in length. In 2003 the college began its new two-year program and with that came the change in name to the Maritime College of Forest Technology.&lt;ref&gt;An Act to Amend An Act to Incorporate the Maritime Forest Ranger School. Accessed 11 May 2015 at http://www.gnb.ca/legis/bill/pdf/54/5/Bill-38.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 MCFT began offering, in addition to the Forest Technology Program, an Advanced Diploma in Forest and Fish &amp; Wildlife Technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcft.ca/en/explore/history/ Maritime College of Forest Technology: History]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Michigan Science Center''' is a science museum in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]].  It is located at the site of the former Detroit Science Center which closed in 2011. The Michigan Science Center was formed as a new non-profit organization and purchased the assets of the Detroit Science Center. The Michigan Science Center (MiSci) opened December 26, 2012.
 
The Michigan Science Center has Michigan’s only Chrysler IMAX Dome Theatre; the Dassault Systèmes Planetarium; the DTE Energy Sparks Theater; the Chrysler Science Stage; a {{convert|8700|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Science Hall for traveling exhibits; hands-on exhibit galleries focusing on space, life and physical science; the United States Steel Fun Factory; an exhibit gallery just for pint-size scientists; and more. 

==History==
Dexter Ferry is credited for the vision and dedication that led to the creation of the Detroit Science Center; the Detroit-area businessman and philanthropist founded the center in 1970. In 1978, the DSC moved to its Midtown, Detroit, facility designed by Master Architect William Kessler of Detroit-based William Kessler Associates in the [[Cultural Center Historic District|midtown cultural center]] adjacent to the [[Detroit Institute of Arts]] and [[Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History]]. 

The center was closed briefly in the early 1990s after losing funding from the State of Michigan, but re-opened in 1991. The Detroit Science Center operated until 1999 when it closed for construction on a $30 million renovation and expansion - tripling the available exhibit space and adding new theater and performance areas. Neumann/Smith Architecture completed the 
{{convert|67600|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. addition and {{convert|51000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. renovation. The Detroit Science Center had a grand re-opening celebration in July 2001 and continued to expand, adding a new Digital Dome Planetarium in December 2001 and a 4D Toyota Engineering Theater in 2008. 

In partnership with the Thompson Educational Foundation, the Detroit Science Center embarked in April 2008 on another expansion of {{convert|80000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}. to create a new college-prep charter school named University Prep Science &amp; Math Middle School on its downtown campus. The school facility has classrooms, a gymnasium with locker rooms, food service, and offices, and shares conference space and lobby with the Detroit Science Center. Two Detroit companies completed the new addition, GunnLevine Architects (Architect of Record) and DeMaria Building Company.

On September 26, 2011, the Detroit Science Center closed due to monetary issues. Several planned events, programs, and trips were either postponed or rescheduled to take place at the Detroit Children's Museum. (Ironically, the Detroit Children's Museum itself was closed in December 2011 due to financial difficulties, but reopened in February 2012 solely to Detroit Public School students and lacking Detroit Science Center affiliation.) 

On September 7, 2012, local Detroit news reports indicated that a new organization, the Michigan Science Center, would open and operate the facility. A spokesperson stated funding over the past year had been "significant" but did not disclose numbers. A board of directors for the Michigan Science Center first met on September 10, 2012. The Michigan Science Center began operations on December 26, 2012.&lt;ref name=DSC&gt;{{cite web|title=Detroit Science Center|url=http://detroithistorical.org/learn/encyclopedia-of-detroit/detroit-science-center|website=Encyclopedia of Detroit|publisher=Detroit Historical Museum|accessdate=1 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Obukhov length is used to describe the effects of buoyancy on turbulent flows, particularly in the lower tenth of the [[atmospheric boundary layer]].  It was first defined by [[Alexander Obukhov]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacobson|first=Mark Z.|title=Fundamentals of Atmospheric Modeling|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WPwEf-1f73wC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=2|year=2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Obukhov |first1=A.M.|year=1946|title=Turbulence in an atmosphere with a non- uniform temperature.|journal= Tr.

Akad. Nauk SSSR Geofiz. Inst|volume=24|pages=163–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; A simple definition of the Monin-Obukhov length is that height at which turbulence is generated more by buoyancy than by wind shear.

The '''Obukhov length''' is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;
L = - \frac{u^3_*\bar\theta_v}{kg(\overline {w^'\theta^'_v})_s}\ 
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;u_*&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Friction velocity|frictional velocity]], &lt;math&gt;\bar\theta_v&lt;/math&gt; is the mean virtual [[potential temperature]], &lt;math&gt;(\overline{w^'\theta^'_v})_s&lt;/math&gt; is the surface virtual potential temperature flux, k is the [[von Kármán constant]]. The virtual potential temperature flux is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}=\overline {w^'\theta^'}+0.61\overline{T}\; \overline {w^'q^'}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; is potential temperature, &lt;math&gt;\overline{T}&lt;/math&gt; is absolute temperature and &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is specific humidity. 


By this definition, &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is usually negative in the daytime since &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; is typically positive during the daytime over land, positive at night when &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; is typically negative, and becomes infinite at dawn and dusk when &lt;math&gt;\overline {w^'\theta^'_v}&lt;/math&gt; passes through zero.

A physical interpretation of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is given by the [[Monin–Obukhov similarity theory]]. During the day &lt;math&gt;-L&lt;/math&gt; is the height at which the buoyant production of [[turbulence kinetic energy]] (TKE) is equal to that produced by the shearing action of the wind (shear production of TKE).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1381">'''Moral evil''' is the result of any morally negative event caused by the intentional action or inaction of an agent, such as a person. An example of a moral evil might be [[murder]], or any other [[evil]] event for which someone can be held responsible or culpable.&lt;ref&gt;"The Two Types of Evil." BBC News. BBC, n.d. Web. 13 Sept. 2014. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/rs/god/chgoodandevilrev1.shtml Christianity: good and evil]&lt;/ref&gt;

This concept can be contrasted with [[natural evil]], in which a bad event occurs naturally, without the intervention of an agent. The dividing line between natural and moral evil is not absolutely clear however, as some behaviour can be unintentional yet morally significant and some natural events (for example, global warming) can be caused by intentional actions.

The distinction of evil from 'bad' is complex. Evil is more than simply 'negative' or 'bad' (i.e. undesired or inhibiting good) as evil is on its own, and without reference to any other event, morally incorrect. The validity of 'moral evil' as a term, therefore, rests on the validity of morals in [[ethics]].

The '''New York State College of Forestry at Cornell''' was a [[statutory college]] established in 1898 at [[Cornell University]] to teach scientific forestry. The first four-year college of forestry in the country, it was defunded by the State of New York in 1903, over controversies involving the college's forestry practices in the Adirondacks. Forestry studies continued at Cornell even after the college's closing.

==Background==
The idea of a Cornell Forestry school began with Colonel [[William F. Fox]], Superintendent of New York's state-owned forests during the mid-1890s. At that time, forestry research and education was conducted only in Great Britain and Europe.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007112429/http://www.dnr.cornell.edu/mission/history/ |archivedate=2007-10-07 |title=Department of Natural Resources - History |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Governor [[Frank S. Black]] went on a fishing trip with a Cornell trustee and discussed Col. Fox's proposal, the suggestion was made that Cornell would be well-suited to implement the demonstration forest. Cornell President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] then began lobbying for a state-funded college, just as he had successfully advocated for a state-funded veterinary college in 1894. The legislature quickly approved the new college.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 122 of the Laws of 1898.&lt;/ref&gt; The act authorized New York State to pay for a tract of forest land in the Adirondacks from funds, previously appropriated for the acquisition of lands to be held "forever wild" in the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]],&lt;ref&gt;Donaldson, Alfred Lee,(1921) A History of the Adirondacks, page 203&lt;/ref&gt; with Cornell holding title, possession, management, and control for 30 years.  After 30 years, the land would revert to the State. Schurman recruited German trained, Dr. [[Bernhard Fernow|Bernhard E. Fernow]], who was then the 3rd Chief of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]]) and one of the top forestry experts in the United States, to be the first Dean of the college.

Fernow moved quickly to acquire a tract of land to serve as a demonstration forest and purchased some.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Fernow's plan called for [[clearcutting]] the forestland at the rate of several thousand acres per year to prepare for planting conifers. He contracted with the [[Brooklyn Cooperage Company]] to take the logs and cordwood from the forest land for a 15-year period. In the 1890s, the more valuable red spruce trees had been logged, leaving primarily northern hardwoods. The years 1899, 1903, and 1908 were terrible years for forest fires in the Adirondacks. Many, tens of thousands of acres were consumed by forest fires. Most fires were started by sparks or embers flying from coal-burning locomotive stacks and landing on [[logging slash]]. [[Louis Marshall]], with a summer residence at [[Knollwood Club]] on [[Lower Saranac Lake]], branded locomotives as "instruments of arson."&lt;ref&gt;Angus,Christopher. The extraordinary Adirondack journey of Clarence Petty: wilderness guide, pilot, and conservationist, p. 17, [[Syracuse University Press]] 2002 {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst sin of the lumbermen was the fire menace that they left behind, and which caused incalculable destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas,Howard. Black River in the  North Country, p.89, Prospect Books,1963&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless,  Fernow had a {{convert|6|mi|km|adj=on}} long railroad spur built from Axton to Tupper Lake in order to deliver logs to the Brooklyn Cooperage Company facility. The company turned the hardwood logs into barrels and the cordwood into [[methanol]] and [[charcoal]], through a process called [[destructive distillation]]. Historic charcoal kiln photo:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite APOD|title=Milky Way Over Abandoned Kilns |date=25 July 2011 |access-date=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To his credit, Fernow established the first tree nursery in New York State at Axton, the site of an old lumber settlement originally called Axe-town. But most of the non-native conifer species he planted, such as [[norway spruce]], did not do well for many years, with a denuded area as a result. Smoke from the burning of brush and logging slash, along with Fernow's arrogant disposition toward landowners from nearby Saranac Lake further alienated the public.&lt;ref&gt;Gove, B. 2005. ''Logging railroads of the Adirondacks''. Syracuse University Press. pp. 176-181.&lt;/ref&gt; Fernow's actions drew criticism also from Adirondack guides such as Ellsworth Petty (father of [[Clarence Petty]]), who protested the plan and, in a letter writing campaign, successfully lobbied the State to assign a special "Committee of the Adirondacks" to tour the Axton site. In its findings, the commission concluded that "the college has exceeded the original intention of the State when the tract was granted the university for conducting silvicultural experiments."&lt;ref name="Christopher 2002. p 31"&gt;Christopher, Angus. 2002. ''The Extraordinary Adirondack Journey of Clarence Petty'', p 31. Syracuse University Press {{ISBN|0-8156-0741-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existence==

In  1898, the New York State College of Forestry opened at Cornell, which was the first forestry college in North America.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;  Because some of the students were transfer students, even though the College had a four-year curriculum, it graduated students during each of the five years of its operation, and the demand for students with Cornell forestry degrees exceeded the supply.  It also offered an optional  fifth year for a professional masters in forestry degree.

In 1899, Fernow had been recruited as a member of New York's [[E.H. Harriman]] expedition to Alaska, along with fellow Cornellian [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]]. The expedition set sail from Seattle on May 31, 1899, aboard the refitted steamer, the ''George W. Elder''. "[Fernow's] research on the expedition was hampered by the fact that the coastal itinerary never gave him a look at the inland forests. His overview thus limited, he concluded that Alaska would never be a great source of timber: the wood was inferior and the conditions of lumbering too difficult. Some say that history has proven him wrong, but his opinion did have an effect: for a time, it discouraged commercial interests from prospecting for timber in the Alaskan forests."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/harriman/1899/1899_part/participantfernow.html |title=Harriman: Bernhard Fernow |publisher=PBS |date=1923-02-06 |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, Fernow founded and became editor-in-chief of  the ''[[Journal of Forestry]]'', the pioneering scholarly journal in this field.

The demonstration forest, near Saranac Lake, in the Adirondacks drew heated opposition from neighboring land owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0L8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA203&amp;lpg=PA203&amp;dq=Brooklyn+Cooperage+Company%5D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3FNnwghrFu&amp;sig=aVmNAw0naLbeOJqb9l1Gyk4E0Eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=QpejSuORNoTYsQOvlImNDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Brooklyn%20Cooperage%20Company%5D&amp;f=false|title=''A history of the Adirondacks, Volume 2''|first=Alfred Lee|last=Donaldson|pages=202–207|publisher=Century Co|year=1921}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an annual state appropriation for the college of only $10,000, Cornell entered into a contract with Brookyn Cooperage Company for the project to be viable. The contract proved to be profitable and beneficial only for the company. Cornell gained insufficient funds to replant the clear-cut areas. A lawsuit was filed, naming the Brooklyn Cooperage Company as defendant with the People of New York State as plaintiff. (See ''[[People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company]]''.)

Although the legislature had adopted the 1903 appropriation without debate,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; Governor [[Benjamin B. Odell]] made a [[pocket veto]] of funds for the school. In his statement, Governor Odell said: "The operations of the College of Forestry have been subjected to grave criticism, as they have practically denuded the forest lands of the State without compensating benefits. I deem it wise therefore to withhold approval of this item until a more scientific and more reasonable method is pursued in the forestry of the lands now under the control of Cornell University."&lt;ref&gt;Charles Z. Lincoln, ed. 1910. ''Messages from the Governors, X''. Albany, p.555, as cited in ''Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University'', 1963, by Gould P. Colman, p.161, Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sacrifice of College of Forestry for the College of Agriculture==

Dean Bailey and Dean [[Bernhard Fernow]], of the Forestry College were the best of friends.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}} In fact, on that night in May 1903 when the telegram arrived announcing Governor Odell's veto of the annual appropriation for the College of Forestry, Bailey and Fernow were together at a dance. Despite the bad news, the dance went on. Fernow did not want to let the veto end his school, and he continued to work without a salary.  He proposed continuing the school by charging tuition to the students.  (During this time, New York State students attended the College tuition-free.) However, Cornell's Board of Trustees and President Schurman (despite Bailey's urgings to the contrary) decided to close the doors of the Forestry College. In June, 1903, instruction in the College ceased and the faculty was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;Rodgers, p. 371.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9A05EEDB1339E333A2575BC1A9609C946297D6CF|title=CORNELL SCHOOL OF FORESTRY SUSPENDED.; Action Followed Failure of State to Provide Means for Its Support.|work=New York Times|date=June 18, 1903|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was rumored, and with good reason, that a political bargain took place exchanging the College of Forestry, for the establishment of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell University in 1904. To quote Liberty Hyde Bailey, "Last winter at Albany I was confronted by inquiries which indicated that the State would be willing to give to either a College of Forestry or a College of Agriculture, but not to both."&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Education &amp; Agriculture, A History of the NYS College of Agriculture at Cornell University,1963, by Gould P. Colman, page 162, Cornell University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as the legislative session of 1904 began in Albany, a most unexpected mishap occurred: at a hearing before the Federal Commission on Agriculture in Washington, the Secretary of Agriculture, James Wilson, attacked Cornell for not teaching "Soil Physics" and took the occasion to revive the old canards about Cornell misusing the riches conferred by the [[Morrill Act]]. He said of Cornell: "They were better endowed than any institution in the land, yet never did anything." Cornell's President [[Jacob Gould Schurman]] demanded a hearing and spoke in Washington with his usual brilliance, refuting the Secretary point by point.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 366.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, in Albany, Senator Ed Stewart of Ithaca introduced a bill drafted by [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]],establishing the New York State College of Agriculture at Cornell. Leading the opposition was Chancellor [[James Roscoe Day|James R. Day]] of Syracuse University. According to Schurman, "the Chancellor led a pious army, the Methodists of the state. He was an angry man; his words breathe a rancor too hot to be contained by facts." He charged that [[Ezra Cornell]] had so "manipulated" the proceeds of the Morrill Act that more than four-fifths were improperly used. He demanded a share in state bounty equal to that accorded Cornell: "Either give to all or not to any!"&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"&gt;Bishop, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Bailey broadcast an immediate refutation, but Chancellor Day had already had his speech published by the Syracuse University Press without change. The Chancellor asked for a hearing before the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee. This request granted, he spoke at the hearing but the chairman and other legislators were insufficiently attentive to him, the Chancellor broke off in a fury and left the room,"before he had adduced a single coherent argument." Dean Bailey, later put up a picture of Chancellor Day, in his office, with the subscription: "Founder of the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell."&lt;ref name="Bishop, p. 367"/&gt;
  
The announcement of the final passage and signing of the bill, in Albany, creating the [[New York State College of Agriculture]] at Cornell was met with bonfires and the pealing of church bells in Ithaca. However, the price for this new state support at Cornell was the sacrifice of the New York State College of Forestry at Cornell.&lt;ref&gt;Colman,p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

The lawsuit, ''People v. the Brooklyn Cooperage Company'', was decided in favor of the People, and again on appeal in 1906;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9905E2D71F3DE633A25750C1A9619C946797D6CF|title=Cornell Forestry Case: Appellate Division Decision Against Brooklyn Cooperage Company|work=New York Times|page=4|date=July 13, 1906|accessdate=2009-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the case defined forestry in the United States for a generation. The {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of forest lands were placed under the "forever wild" protection of the [[Adirondack Forest Preserve]]. At the conclusion of the case, constitutional lawyer [[Louis Marshall]] stated, "I hold before me the decision in the case of the People against the Brooklyn Cooperage Company.....the consequence of that was that this 'tremendous' tract of thirty thousand acres was to be cut down 'flat' from one end of it to the other, in order that the scientific foresters might start a new forest which might mature a hundred years from the time that that contract was entered into. This is scientific forestry?".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Reznikoff, Charles, ed., ''Louis Marshall: Champion of Liberty. Selected Papers and Addresses''. 2 vols. Philadelphia: The Jewish Publication Society of America, 1957., page 1020.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1907, [[Bernhard E. Fernow]] became the first professor of forestry in a four-year baccalaureate degree program at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]], in State College, after having been the nation's first consulting forester since leaving Cornell and Ithaca in 1903. His office was in New York City. After teaching the 1907 spring semester at Penn State, Dr. Fernow left to become the first head of the Faculty of Forestry at the [[University of Toronto]]. He gave as a reason for leaving Penn State his argument with Dr.[[Joseph Rothrock]] that [[Penn State Mont Alto]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/ourhist.htm |title=Penn State Mont Alto: Our History |publisher=Ma.psu.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226102802/http://www.ma.psu.edu/Information/ourhist.htm |archivedate=2015-02-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; should not have departed from its role as a "ranger school" to pursue higher aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ys1muh3jqXsC&amp;dq=A+century+of+forest+resources+education+at+Penn+State:+serving+our+forests+...++By+Henry+D.+Gerhold&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5dZR-SoqGO&amp;sig=gClSfVwnlH6LRXDb5USxCJl0dTk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=j3THSuWmB8yY8AaU0KXhCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#v=onepage&amp;q=bernhard%20fernow&amp;f=false |title=A Century of Forest Resources Education at Penn State: Serving Our Forests ... - Henry D.

It was one of three forestry schools in the nation in 1903, after Yale and Biltmore, respectively.

[[File:Cornell Fernow Hall September 2008.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Fernow Hall|Fernow Hall on the Cornell Campus.]]

In 1910, [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], the Dean of Cornell's Agriculture College, succeeded in having what remained of the Forestry College transferred to his school.  At his request, in 1911, the legislature appropriated $100,000 to construct a building to house the new Forestry Department on the Cornell campus, which Cornell later named [[Fernow Hall (Ithaca, New York)|Fernow Hall]]. That Forestry Department continues today as the Department of Natural Resources. In 1927, Cornell established a {{convert|1639|acre|km2|adj=on}} research forest south of Ithaca, the Arnot Woods.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt;

In 1911, the State Legislature established a [[State University of New York College of Environmental Science and Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]] at [[Syracuse University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not without opposition from Cornell University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20B1FFA3B5F13738DDDAD0994DD405B838DF1D3&amp;scp=18&amp;sq=new%20york%20state%20college%20of%20forestry,syracuse&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=OPPOSES FORESTRY SCHOOL; Cornell Against $310,000 Appropriation for Syracuse Department | date=May 14, 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1930, the NYS [[Board of Regents]] questioned the need for duplicate, state-supported forestry programs at Cornell and Syracuse. A formal study resulted in an agreement in 1937 that the Syracuse program would be the only place for professional undergraduate training in forestry. Cornell's Department of Forestry continued with courses in "farm" forestry, to [[cooperative extension]] work in forestry, and to research and graduate education.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; In an exchange, [[Syracuse University]] agreed to abandon its School of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.syr.edu/exhibits/sunyesf_1900-1919.html |title=Syracuse University Archives: Exhibits - "SUNY ESF and SU: 100 Years of Collaboration" - 1900-1919 |publisher=Archives.syr.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2013/01/syracuse_universitys_history_a.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2000, SUNY System Administration established ESF's "primacy" among the 64 SUNY campuses and contract colleges for development of new undergraduate degree programs in Environmental Science and Environmental Studies, but ESF does not have a veto power over competing new programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.esf.edu/es/documents/GuidelinesforConsidofnewugDegreePgms6302000.pdf | title=Guidelines for Consideration of New Undergraduate Degree Programs in Environmental Science/Studies| accessdate=2010-12-18| author=Peter D. Salins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forestry Studies continue at Cornell==

Cornell’s vertebrate museum’s fishes collection is particularly strong with great diversity in North American fishes, and minnows in particular. Beginning in the 1940s and continuing into the 1970s the fish collection was greatly expanded thanks to collections made by renowned Cornell ichthyologist Edward Raney and his students.

The Cornell [[Hortorium]] founded by Liberty Hyde Bailey in 1935, has historically been the major U. S. center for the systematics of cultivated plants.&lt;ref&gt;https://plantbio.cals.cornell.edu/hortorium&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://rmc.library.cornell.edu/bailey/hortorium/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following in the footsteps of the great [[botanist]] and [[horticulturist]], [[Liberty Hyde Bailey]], a most extraordinary [[plant physiologist]], [[Frederick Campion Steward]], arrived to teach and conduct research at Cornell University in 1950, as Professor of Botany. From his Cornell classrooms and laboratories, Steward was responsible for creating and inspiring a generation of botanists.

In 1978, the [[Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]] relocated to the Ithaca campus from its original site in Yonkers, NY. Its history is extremely interesting and relevant.&lt;ref name=bti1&gt;[http://bti.cornell.edu/index.php?page=AboutUs&amp;section=History#page=Overview "History of BTI," Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bti&gt;[http://bti.cornell.edu/ Homepage, Boyce Thompson Institute for Plant Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[Raphael Zon]], Director, Lake States Forest Experiment Station, United States Forest Service.
“Reprinted with revised Bibliography, 1927, from Appendix V of the Final Report of the National Waterways Commission, 1912. (Senate Document No. 469, 62d Congress, 2d Session)”

“Object of the Report”

“ Of all the direct influences of the forest the influence upon the supply of water in streams and upon the regularity of their flow is the most important in human economy. Yet so many are the factors which play related parts in this influence, so great is the difficulty of observing them with precision, and so wide the range of economic interests affected, that considerable divergence of opinion has arisen on the subject. This, however, if prompted by a sincere desire to reach the bottom of a complicated and vital problem, can only be productive of results of the highest scientific value.”

“ There is, perhaps no other problem facing the American people to-day which demands such care in the scientific accuracy of its data and conclusions as does the relation between forests and water. It is imperative, therefore, that no final conclusions be drawn in regard to this relation until ample, reliable, and critically revised evidence upon which to base them is available. A national policy which, though considering the direct value of forests as a source of timber, fails to take full account also of their influence upon erosion, the flow of streams, and climate, may easily endanger the well-being of the whole people.” (page 1)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fs.fed.us/rm/boise/AWAE/labs/awae_flagstaff/Hot_Topics/SierraAnchaEF/publications/hibbert_fortrtmnteffectswateryield.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

__NOTOC__
'''Nuffield Speech and Language Unit''' was an internationally recognised centre of excellence for providing intensive therapy to children who suffered from severe [[Speech and language therapy|speech and language disorders]]:
* [[Developmental coordination disorder#Speech and language|Developmental Verbal Dyspraxia]]
* [[Dysarthria]]
* Oral dyspraxia
* Severe language disorders
* Severe receptive language disorder

It took in children as young as four years of age, who without expert therapy would not be able to ever go on to enter and survive in mainstream education.

It was administered to by the [[Royal Free Hampstead NHS Trust]].

==History==
In 1947 [[Edith Whetnall]] went to work for the [[Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital]] where she became the first director of what would become the ''Nuffield Hearing and Speech Centre''. This was built at a cost of £100,000 which was promised after a presentation to [[Lord Nuffield]] by Whetnall.&lt;ref name=beagley&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Beagley|first1=HA|title=Edith Whetnall's contribution to British audiology|journal=J R Soc Med|date=1978|volume=71|issue=12|pages=870–878|pmc=1436295|pmid=368335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Hearing test|hearing problems]] became to be diagnosed earlier through better and more sensitive screening methods the unit's speciality or expertise expanded  to include disorders of speech and language. So as not to hold the children back educationally from their  peers who could attend normal schools the unit then included an educational curriculum so as to ease the children's eventual transition into mainstream education.
The unit  then became part of the Royal National Throat, Nose and Ear Hospital.  The unit also went on to develop the ''Nuffield Centre Dyspraxia Programme''.

Ealing PCT held a public consultation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afasic.org.uk/2011/03/nuffield-consultation/ Public consultation on the future of the Nuffield Speech and Language Unit]&lt;/ref&gt; on the future of the Nuffield Speech and Language Unit, which closed in April 2011, and the matter was the subject of an Adjournment Debate in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060425/debtext/60425-17.htm#60425-17_spnew0.

{{Labour|expanded=rights|sp=uk}} 
'''Occupational safety and health''' ('''OSH'''), also commonly referred to as '''occupational health and safety''' ('''OHS'''), '''occupational health''',&lt;ref&gt;It can be confusing that British English also uses ''[[industrial medicine]]'' to refer to occupational health and safety and uses ''occupational health'' to refer to [[occupational medicine]]. See the Collins Dictionary entries for [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/industrial-medicine ''industrial medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-medicine ''occupational medicine''] and [http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/occupational-health ''occupational health''].&lt;/ref&gt; or '''workplace health and safety''' ('''WHS'''), is a multidisciplinary field concerned with the [[safety]], [[health]], and [[quality of life|welfare]] of people at [[Employment|work]]. These terms also refer to the goals of this field,&lt;ref&gt;[Mosby's Medical Dictionary http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/occupational+health]&lt;/ref&gt; so their use in the sense of this article was originally an abbreviation of ''occupational safety and health program/department'' etc.

The goals of occupational safety and health programs include to foster a safe and healthy work environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Oak Ridge National Laboratory {{!}} ORNL|url = http://www.ornl.gov|website = www.ornl.gov|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; OSH may also protect co-workers, family members, employers, customers, and many others who might be affected by the workplace environment. In the United States, the term occupational health and safety is referred to as '''occupational health and occupational and non-occupational safety''' and includes safety for activities outside of work.&lt;ref name= Fanning&gt;Fanning, Fred E. (2003). Basic Safety Administration: A Handbook for the New Safety Specialist, Chicago: American Society of Safety Engineers&lt;/ref&gt;

In common-law jurisdictions, employers have a common law duty to take reasonable care of the safety of their employees.&lt;ref name=WAgdoc&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance note: General duty of care in Western Australian workplaces 2005|url=http://www.commerce.wa.gov.au/sites/default/files/atoms/files/general_duty_of_care.pdf|publisher=Government of Western Australia|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Statute law may in addition impose other general duties, introduce specific duties, and create government bodies with powers to regulate workplace safety issues: details of this vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.

==Definition==
As defined by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) "occupational health deals with all aspects of health and safety in the workplace and has a strong focus on primary prevention of hazards."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = WPRO {{!}} Occupational health|url = http://www.wpro.who.int/topics/occupational_health/en/|website = www.wpro.who.int|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Health]] has been defined as "a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print.html|title = WHO Definition of Health|date = |accessdate = |website = World Health Organization|publisher = World Health Organization|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160707120526/http://www.who.int/about/definition/en/print.html|archivedate = 2016-07-07|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupational health is a multidisciplinary field of [[healthcare]] concerned with enabling an individual to undertake their [[Job|occupation]], in the way that causes least harm to their health. Health has been defined as It contrasts, for example, with the promotion of health and safety at work, which is concerned with preventing harm from any incidental [[hazards]], arising in the workplace.

Since 1950, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) and the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) have shared a common definition of occupational health. It was adopted by the Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health at its first session in 1950 and revised at its twelfth session in 1995. The definition reads:

{{quote|"The main focus in occupational health is on three different objectives: (i) the maintenance and promotion of workers’ health and working capacity; (ii) the improvement of working environment and work to become conducive to safety and health and (iii) development of work organizations and working cultures in a direction which supports health and safety at work and in doing so also promotes a positive social climate and smooth operation and may enhance productivity of the undertakings. The concept of working culture is intended in this context to mean a reflection of the essential value systems adopted by the undertaking concerned. Such a culture is reflected in practice in the managerial systems, personnel policy, principles for participation, training policies and quality management of the undertaking."|Joint ILO/WHO Committee on Occupational Health&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ilo.org/safework_bookshelf/english?content&amp;nd=857170174 |title=Occupational Health Services And Practice |publisher=Ilo.org |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Those in the field of occupational health come from a wide range of [[discipline (academia)|disciplines]] and professions including [[medicine]], [[psychology]], [[epidemiology]], [[physiotherapy]] and rehabilitation, [[occupational therapy]], [[occupational medicine]], [[human factors and ergonomics]], and many others. Professionals advise on a broad range of occupational health matters. These include how to avoid particular pre-existing conditions causing a problem in the occupation, correct posture for the work, frequency of rest breaks, preventative action that can be undertaken, and so forth.

"Occupational health should aim at: the promotion and maintenance of the highest degree of physical, mental and social well-being of workers in all occupations; the prevention amongst workers of departures from health caused by their working conditions; the protection of workers in their employment from risks resulting from factors adverse to health; the placing and maintenance of the worker in an occupational environment adapted to his physiological and psychological capabilities; and, to summarize, the adaptation of work to man and of each man to his job.

==History==
[[File:Lewis Wickes Hines - Harry McShane 1908.jpg|right|thumb|Harry McShane, age 16, 1908. Pulled into machinery in a factory in [[Cincinnati]] and had his arm ripped off at the shoulder and his leg broken without any compensation.]]
The research and regulation of occupational safety and health are a relatively recent phenomenon. As [[labor movements]] arose in response to worker concerns in the wake of the industrial revolution, worker's health entered consideration as a labor-related issue.

In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Factory Acts]] of the early nineteenth century (from 1802 onwards) arose out of concerns about the poor health of children working in cotton mills: the Act of 1833 created a dedicated professional [[Factory inspector|Factory Inspectorate]].&lt;ref name=Hutchins_Harrison_1911&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hutchins|first1=B L|last2=Harrison|first2=A|title=A history of factory legislation by ;   Published 1911|date=1911|publisher=P S King &amp; Son|location=Westminster|edition=2nd|url=https://archive.org/details/factoryofhistory00hutcrich|accessdate=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{rp|41}}  The initial remit of the Inspectorate was to police restrictions on the working hours in the textile industry of children and young persons (introduced to prevent chronic overwork, identified as leading directly to ill-health and deformation, and indirectly to a high accident rate).  However, on the urging of the Factory Inspectorate, a further Act in 1844 giving similar restrictions on working hours for women in the textile industry introduced a requirement for machinery guarding (but only in the textile industry, and only in areas that might be accessed by women or children).&lt;ref name=Hutchins_Harrison_1911/&gt; {{rp|85}}

In 1840 a [[Royal Commission]] published its findings on the state of conditions for the workers of the mining industry that documented the appallingly dangerous environment that they had to work in and the high frequency of accidents. The commission sparked public outrage which resulted in the Mines Act of 1842. The act set up an inspectorate for mines and collieries which resulted in many prosecutions and safety improvements, and by 1850, inspectors were able to enter and inspect premises at their discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = An Account of the Founding of H.M.

[[Otto von Bismarck]] inaugurated the first social insurance legislation in 1883 and the first [[worker's compensation]] law in 1884 – the first of their kind in the Western world. Similar acts followed in other countries, partly in response to labor unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abrams|first=Herbert K.|title=A Short History of Occupational Health|journal=Journal of Public Health Policy|volume=22|issue=1|pages=34–80|url=http://cavcominc.com/uploads/files/History_OccHealth_Abrams.pdf|accessdate=9 August 2012 |doi=10.2307/3343553 |pmid=11382089 |year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Workplace hazards==
{{main article|Occupational hazard}}

Although work provides many economic and other benefits, a wide array of workplace hazards also present risks to the health and safety of people at work. These include but are not limited to, "chemicals, biological agents, physical factors, adverse ergonomic conditions, allergens, a complex network of safety risks," and a broad range of psychosocial risk factors.&lt;ref&gt;Concha-Barrientos, M., Imel, N.D., Driscoll, T., Steenland, N.K., Punnett, L., Fingerhut, M.A., Prüss-Üstün, A., Leigh, J., Tak, S.W., Corvalàn, C.

[[Physical hazard]]s affect many people in the workplace. Occupational hearing loss is the most common work-related injury in the United States, with 22 million workers exposed to hazardous noise levels at work and an estimated $242 million spent annually on worker's compensation for hearing loss disability.&lt;ref name="topic-noise2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Noise and Hearing Loss Prevention|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/noise/|work = Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics|publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate = 3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Falling (accident)|Falls]] are also a common cause of occupational injuries and fatalities, especially in construction, extraction, transportation, healthcare, and building cleaning and maintenance.&lt;ref name="fall_topic2"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/falls/|title = Fall Injuries Prevention in the Workplace|work = NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate = July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Machines have moving parts, sharp edges, hot surfaces and other hazards with the potential to crush, [[burn]], [[Cutting|cut]], [[Shearing (physics)|shear]], [[Stabbing|stab]] or otherwise [[Impact force|strike]] or [[wound]] workers if used unsafely.&lt;ref name="topic-machine2"&gt;{{cite web |title = Machine Safety|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/machine/|work = NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher = National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate = 11 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Biological hazard]]s (biohazards) include infectious microorganisms such as viruses and toxins produced by those organisms such as [[anthrax]]. Biohazards affect workers in many industries; [[influenza]], for example, affects a broad population of workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Seasonal Influenza (Flu) in the Workplace - Guidance - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/flu/guidance.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outdoor workers, including farmers, landscapers, and construction workers, risk exposure to numerous biohazards, including animal bites and stings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Insects and Scorpions - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/insects/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Venomous Snakes - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/snakes/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Venomous Spiders - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/spiders/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[urushiol]] from poisonous plants,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Poisonous Plants - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/plants/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and diseases transmitted through animals such as the West Nile virus and Lyme disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Lyme Disease - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/lyme/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - West Nile Virus - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/westnile/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health care workers, including [[Veterinary medicine|veterinary health]] workers, risk exposure to [[Blood-borne disease|blood-borne pathogens]] and various infectious diseases,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Veterinary Health Care: Biological Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/veterinary/biological.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Bloodborne Infectious Diseases - HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B Virus, and Hepatitis C Virus - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially those that are [[Emerging infectious disease|emerging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Emerging Infectious Diseases - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/emerginfectdiseases/default.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dangerous chemicals can pose a [[Chemical hazards|chemical hazard]] in the workplace. There are many classifications of hazardous chemicals, including neurotoxins, immune agents, dermatologic agents, carcinogens, reproductive toxins, systemic toxins, asthmagens, pneumoconiotic agents, and sensitizers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - Chemical Safety - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/chemical-safety/|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authorities such as regulatory agencies set [[occupational exposure limit]]s to mitigate the risk of chemical hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IOHA - International OEL Issues and Activities|url = http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html|website = www.ioha.net|accessdate = 2015-09-04|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150811010958/http://www.ioha.net/internationaloelssues.html|archivedate = 2015-08-11|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An international effort is investigating the health effects of mixtures of chemicals. There is some evidence that certain chemicals are harmful at lower levels when mixed with one or more other chemicals.

[[Psychosocial hazard]]s include risks to the mental and emotional well-being of workers, such as feelings of job insecurity, long work hours, and poor work-life balance.&lt;ref name="euosha"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://osha.europa.eu/en/tools-and-publications/publications/reports/7807118|title = Expert forecast on emerging psychosocial risks related to occupational safety and health|date = 2007|accessdate = September 3, 2015|website = |publisher = European Agency for Safety and Health at Work|last = Brun|first = Emmanuelle|last2 = Milczarek|first2 = Malgorzata}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent [[Cochrane review]] - using moderate quality evidence - related that the addition of work-directed interventions for depressed workers receiving clinical interventions reduces the number of lost work days as compared to clinical interventions alone.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD006237.pub3/abstract|title = Interventions to improve return to work in depressed people|last = Nieuwenhuijsen|first = Karen|date = 1 Jan 2014|journal = Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD006237.pub3|pmid = 25470301|access-date = 7 October 2015|volume=12|pages=CD006237}}&lt;/ref&gt; This review also demonstrated that the addition of cognitive behavioral therapy to primary or occupational care and the addition of a "structured telephone outreach and care management program" to usual care are both effective at reducing sick leave days.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== By industry ==
Specific occupational safety and health risk factors vary depending on the specific sector and industry. [[Construction]] workers might be particularly at risk of falls, for instance, whereas fishermen might be particularly at risk of [[drowning]]. The United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] identifies the [[commercial fishing|fishing]], [[aviation]], [[lumber]], [[metalworking]], [[agriculture]], [[mining]] and [[transportation]] industries as among some of the more dangerous for workers.&lt;ref name=bls-iif&gt;{{cite web |title=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities 2010|url=http://www.bls.gov/iif/|work=Injuries, Illnesses, and Fatalities|publisher=Bureau of Labor Statistics|accessdate=9 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly psychosocial risks such as [[workplace violence]] are more pronounced for certain occupational groups such as health care employees, police, correctional officers and teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Violence in the Workplace : OSH Answers|url = http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/psychosocial/violence.html|website = www.ccohs.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-30|first = Government of Canada, Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and|last = Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===

[[File:China Constrcution Site Safety.jpg|thumb|Workplace safety notices at the entrance of a Chinese construction site.]]
Construction is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world, incurring more occupational fatalities than any other sector in both the [[United States]] and in the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=niosh-topic&gt;{{cite web |title=Construction Safety and Health|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/construction/|work=Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topics|publisher=National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=eurostat&gt;{{cite web |title=Health and safety at work statistics|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Health_and_safety_at_work_statistics|work=eurostat|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=3 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the fatal occupational injury rate among construction workers in the United States was nearly three times that for all workers.&lt;ref name=niosh-topic/&gt; [[falling (accident)|Falls]] are one of the most common causes of fatal and non-fatal injuries among construction workers.&lt;ref name=niosh-topic/&gt; Proper safety equipment such as harnesses and guardrails and procedures such as securing ladders and inspecting scaffolding can curtail the risk of occupational injuries in the construction industry.&lt;ref name=osha-campaign&gt;{{cite web |title=OSHA's Fall Prevention Campaign|url=https://www.osha.gov/stopfalls/|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the fact that accidents may have disastrous consequences for employees as well as organizations, it is of utmost importance to ensure health and [[safety]] of workers and compliance with HSE construction requirements. Health and safety legislation in the construction industry involves many rules and regulations.  For example, the role of the Construction Design Management (CDM) Coordinator as a requirement has been aimed at improving health and safety on-site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veritas-consulting.co.uk/blog/health-and-safety-in-the-construction-industry/|title=Health and safety in the Construction Industry|date=11 March 2009|publisher=Veritas Consulting|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 [[National Health Interview Survey#Research topics|National Health Interview Survey Occupational Health Supplement]] (NHIS-OHS) identified work organization factors and occupational psychosocial and chemical/physical exposures which may increase some health risks. Among all U.S. workers in the construction sector, 44% had non-standard work arrangements (were not regular permanent employees) compared to 19% of all U.S. workers, 15% had temporary employment compared to 7% of all U.S. workers, and 55% experienced job insecurity compared to 32% of all U.S. workers. Prevalence rates for exposure to physical/chemical hazards were especially high for the construction sector. Among nonsmoking workers, 24% of construction workers were exposed to secondhand smoke while only 10% of all U.S. workers were exposed. Other physical/chemical hazards with high prevalence rates in the construction industry were frequently working outdoors (73%) and frequent exposure to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes (51%).&lt;ref name=nhis_construction&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Construction Sector Profile Page – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/construction.html | accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
{{Main article|Agricultural safety and health}}[[File:Ford Tractor with ROPS bar fitted.JPG|right|thumb|[[Rollover protection system|Rollover protection bar]] on a [[Fordson tractor|Fordson]] tractor.]]
Agriculture workers are often at risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin disease, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use or prolonged sun exposure. On [[industrial agriculture|industrialized farms]], injuries frequently involve the use of [[agricultural machinery]]. The most common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in the United States is tractor rollovers, which can be prevented by the use of [[roll over protection structures]] which limit the risk of injury in case a tractor rolls over.&lt;ref name="aginjury"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/aginjury/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agricultural Injuries |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2012-07-13 |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can also be hazardous to worker health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garzia|first=Nichole A.|last2=Spinelli|first2=John J.|last3=Gotay|first3=Carolyn C.|last4=Teschke|first4=Kay|date=2018-07-03|title=Literature review: dermal monitoring data for pesticide exposure assessment of farm workers|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=187–214|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1448734|pmid=30047858|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illnesses or birth defects.&lt;ref name=NIOSH_pest&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2012-108/ |title=NIOSH Pesticide Poisoning Monitoring Program Protects Farmworkers |publisher=Cdc.gov |date=2009-07-31 |accessdate=2013-02-15|doi=10.26616/NIOSHPUB2012108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As an industry in which families, including children, commonly work alongside their families, agriculture is a common source of occupational injuries and illnesses among younger workers.&lt;ref name="NIOSH alert youth"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2003-128/pdfs/2003128.PDF |title=NIOSH Alert: Preventing Deaths, Injuries, and Illnesses of Young Workers |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common causes of fatal injuries among young farm worker include drowning, machinery and motor vehicle-related accidents.&lt;ref name="NIOSH Agri"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/agriculture/ |title=NIOSH Workplace Safety &amp; Health Topic: Agriculture |publisher=Cdc.gov |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010 NHIS-OHS found elevated prevalence rates of several occupational exposures in the agriculture, forestry, and fishing sector which may negatively impact health. These workers often worked long hours. The prevalence rate of working more than 48 hours a week among workers employed in these industries was 37%, and 24% worked more than 60 hours a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumaraveloo|first=K Sakthiaseelan|last2=Lunner Kolstrup|first2=Christina|date=2018-07-03|title=Agriculture and musculoskeletal disorders in low- and middle-income countries|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=227–248|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1458671|pmid=30047854|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all workers in these industries, 85% frequently worked outdoors compared to 25% of all U.S. workers.

===Service sector===
{{see also|Service sector}}
As the number of [[service sector]] jobs has risen in developed countries, more and more jobs have become [[sedentary lifestyle|sedentary]], presenting a different array of health problems than those associated with [[manufacturing]] and the [[primary sector]]. Contemporary problems such as the growing rate of [[obesity]] and issues relating to [[occupational stress]], [[workplace bullying]], and [[overwork]] in many countries have further complicated the interaction between work and health.

According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, hazardous physical/chemical exposures in the service sector were lower than national averages. On the other hand, potentially harmful work organization characteristics and psychosocial workplace exposures were relatively common in this sector. Among all workers in the service industry, 30% experienced job insecurity in 2010, 27% worked non-standard shifts (not a regular day shift), 21% had non-standard work arrangements (were not regular permanent employees).&lt;ref name=nhis_service&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Services Sector Profile Page – NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topic | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013 | url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/service.html | accessdate=July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the manual labour involved and on a per employee basis, the US Postal Service, UPS and FedEx are the 4th, 5th and 7th most dangerous companies to work for in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Phillips|first1=Owen|title=The USPS is an extremely dangerous place to work|url=https://theoutline.com/post/1836/the-usps-is-an-extremely-dangerous-place-to-work|accessdate=30 June 2017|work=[[The Outline (website)]]|date=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining and oil &amp; gas extraction===
{{see also |Mine safety}}
According to data from the 2010 NHIS-OHS, workers employed in mining and oil and gas extraction industries had high prevalence rates of exposure to potentially harmful work organization characteristics and hazardous chemicals. Many of these workers worked long hours: 50% worked more than 48 hours a week and 25% worked more than 60 hours a week in 2010. Additionally, 42% worked non-standard shifts (not a regular day shift). These workers also had high prevalence of exposure to physical/chemical hazards. In 2010, 39% had frequent skin contact with chemicals. Among nonsmoking workers, 28% of those in mining and oil and gas extraction industries had frequent exposure to [[passive smoking|secondhand smoke]] at work. About two-thirds were frequently exposed to vapors, gas, dust, or fumes at work.&lt;ref name=nhis_mining&gt;{{cite web | title = CDC – NHIS – Mining and Oil and Gas Extraction Sectors Profile Page | publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention | date = June 28, 2013 | url =https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/nhis/mining.html | accessdate = July 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Beekeeper keeping bees.jpg|upright|right|Beekeepers often wear protective clothing, for OHS reasons|thumb]]

Healthcare workers are exposed to many hazards that can adversely affect their health and well-being. Long hours, changing shifts, physically demanding tasks, violence, and exposures to infectious diseases and harmful chemicals are examples of hazards that put these workers at risk for illness and injury.

According to the Bureau of Labor statistics, U.S. hospitals recorded 253,700 work-related injuries and illnesses in 2011, which is 6.8 work-related injuries and illnesses for every 100 full-time employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Facts About Hospital Worker Safety|publisher = Occupational Safety and Health Administration|year = 2013|isbn = |location = |pages = |url = https://www.osha.gov/dsg/hospitals/documents/1.2_Factbook_508.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The injury and illness rate in hospitals is higher than the rates in construction and manufacturing – two industries that are traditionally thought to be relatively hazardous.

The Occupational Health Safety Network (OHSN)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ohsn/|title=CDC - Occupational Safety Health Network (OHSN)  - NIOSH Workplace Safety and Health Topics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a secure electronic surveillance system developed by the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)]] to address health and safety risks among health care personnel. OHSN uses existing data to characterize risk of injury and illness among health care workers. Hospitals and other healthcare facilities can upload the occupational injury data they already collect to the secure database for analysis and benchmarking with other de-identified facilities.  NIOSH works with OHSN participants in identifying and implementing timely and targeted interventions. OHSN modules currently focus on three high risk and preventable events that can lead to injuries or musculoskeletal disorders among healthcare personnel: musculoskeletal injuries from patient handling activities;&lt;ref&gt;See NPR series [https://www.npr.org/series/385540559/injured-nurses Injured Nurses] about patient handling risks&lt;/ref&gt; slips, trips, and falls; and workplace violence. OHSN enrollment is open to all healthcare facilities.

The [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]] compiles information about workplace [[occupational fatality|fatalities]] and non-fatal injuries in the [[United States]]. In 1970, an estimated 14,000 workers were killed on the job – by 2010, the workforce had doubled, but workplace deaths were down to about 4,500.&lt;ref name= AAO &gt;{{cite web|title=All About OSHA|url=https://www.osha.gov/Publications/all_about_OSHA.pdf|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt; Between 1913 and 2013, workplace fatalities dropped by approximately 80%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.cdc.gov/niosh-science-blog/2013/04/26/wmd2013/ |title = WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY 2013 |first = John |last = Howard |date = 26 April 2013 |accessdate = 21 January 2015 |publisher = National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bureau also compiles information about the most dangerous jobs. According to the census of occupational injuries 4,679 people died on the job in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, a decline in nonfatal workplace injuries and illnesses was observed, with private industry employers reporting approximately 2.9 million incidents, nearly 48,000 fewer cases than in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Taylor|first1=Mark |title=Your Workplace Safe Employees|url= https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/your-workplace-safe-employees-mark-taylor |website=LinkedIn |accessdate=28 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau also uses tools like www.AgInjuryNews.org&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aginjurynews.org|title=Ag Injury News Clippings|website=www.aginjurynews.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; to identify and compile additional sources of fatality reports for their datasets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://umash.umn.edu/spotlight-ag-injury-news-clippings-database/|title=SPOTLIGHT: Ag Injury News Clippings Database|last=umash|date=2016-11-07|work=Upper Midwest Agricultural Safety and Health Center|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Weichelt|first=Bryan|last2=Gorucu|first2=Serap|date=2018-02-17|title=Supplemental surveillance: a review of 2015 and 2016 agricultural injury data from news reports on AgInjuryNews.org|url=http://injuryprevention.bmj.com/content/early/2018/02/16/injuryprev-2017-042671|journal=Injury Prevention|language=en|pages=injuryprev–2017–042671|doi=10.1136/injuryprev-2017-042671|issn=1353-8047|pmid=29386372}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Musculoskeletal injuries]] accounted for 32% of all employer-reported injuries and illnesses in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bls.gov/news.release/archives/osh2_11192015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
In most countries males comprise the vast majority of workplace fatalities. In the EU as a whole, 94% of death were of males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emhf.org/resource_images/Vienna_Declaration_Bgrd_Doc.pdf|title=The Vienna Declaration on the health of men and boys in Europe|publisher=European Men's Health Forum|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK the disparity was even greater with males comprising 97.4% of workplace deaths. In the UK there were 171 fatal injuries at work in financial year 2011–2012, compared with 651 in calendar year 1974; the fatal injury rate declined over that period from 2.9 fatalities per 100,000 workers to 0.6 per 100,000 workers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Historical picture : Trends in work-related injuries and ill health in Great Britain since the introduction of the Health and Safety at Work Act (HSWA) 1974|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/history/historical-picture.pdf|website=Health &amp; Safety Executive|publisher=|accessdate=15 July 2014}} : of course the period saw the virtual disappearance from the UK of some historically risky industries (deep sea fishing, coal mining)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the destruction of the USSR, the enterprises became owned by new owners who were not interested in preserving the life and health of workers.{{cn|date=September 2018}} They did not spend money on equipment modernization, and the share of harmful workplaces increased.{{cn|date=September 2018}} The state did not interfere in this, and sometimes it helped employers.{{cn|date=September 2018}} At first, the process of growth was slow - due to the fact that in the 1990s this was compensated by mass de-industrialization (factories with foundries and other harmful types of production were closed).{{cn|date=September 2018}} In the 2000s, this method of restraining the growth of the share of harmful workplaces was exhausted. Therefore, in 2010s the [[Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs (Russia)|Ministry of Labor]] adopted the Federal law 426-FZ, which equated the issuance of [[Personal protective equipment|personal protective equipment]] to the employee to real improvement of working conditions; and the [[Ministry of Health (Russia)|Ministry of Health]] made significant changes in the methods of risk assessment in the workplace.&lt;ref name="Chebotarev-2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chebotarev |first1=Alexander |title=Working environment and occupational morbidity of mine personnel |journal=Mining Industry Journal |date=January 2018 |issue=1 (137) |pages=92-95 |doi=10.30686/1609-9192-2018-1-137-92-95 |url=https://mining-media.ru/en/articleen/13414-working-environment-and-occupational-morbidity-of-mine-personnel |accessdate=18 October 2018 |publisher=Research and production company "Gemos limited" |location=Moscow |language=ru |issn=1609-9192}}&lt;/ref&gt; This explains the "decline" in the proportion of workers working in harmful conditions after 2014 - it happened not in practice, but only on paper.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Management systems==
===National===
National management system standards for occupational health and safety include AS/NZS 4801-2001 for Australia and New Zealand, CAN/CSA-Z1000-14 for Canada and ANSI/ASSE Z10-2012 for the United States.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standards.org.au/standards-catalogue/sa-snz/publicsafety/sf-001/as-slash-nzs--4801-2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cos-mag.com/safety-leadership-culture/columns/iso-45001-is-now-available-are-you-considering-it/ |title=ISO 45001 is now available — are you considering it? |last=Pozniak |first=Eldeen |date=13 March 2018 |website=Canadian HR Reporter |publisher=Thomson Reuters Canada Limited |access-date=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AFNOR|Association Française de Normalisation (AFNOR)]] in France also developed occupational safety and health management standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Pun K.-F. |author2=Yam R.C.M. |author3=Lewis W.G. | year = 2003 | title = Safety management system registration in the shipping industry | url = | journal = International Journal of Quality &amp; Reliability Management | volume = 20 | issue = 6| pages = 704–721 | doi=10.1108/02656710310482140}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, non-departmental public body [[Health and Safety Executive]] published Managing for health and safety (MFHS), an online guidance.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.actassociates.co.uk/news-view.asp?ID=451&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the state factory inspectorates of Bavaria and Saxony had introduced the management system OHRIS. In the Netherlands, the management system Safety Certificate Contractors combines management of occupational health and safety and the environment.

===International===
[[ISO 45001]] was published in March 2018.

Previously, the [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) published ILO-OSH 2001, also titled "Guidelines on occupational safety and health management systems" to assist organizations with introducing OSH management systems.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Guidelines on Occupational Safety and Health Management Systems|publisher = ILO-OSH|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Geneva|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These guidelines encourage continual improvement in employee health and safety, achieved via a constant process of policy, organization, planning &amp; implementation, evaluation, and action for improvement, all supported by constant auditing to determine the success of OSH actions.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; From 1999 to 2018, the occupational health and safety management system standard [[OHSAS 18001]] was adopted as a British and Polish standard and widely used internationally. OHSAS 18000 comprised two parts, OHSAS 18001 and 18002 and was developed by a selection of leading trade bodies, international standards and certification bodies to address a gap where no third-party certifiable international standard existed.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} It was intended to integrate with ISO 9001 and ISO 14001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bsigroup.com/en/Assessment-and-certification-services/management-systems/Standards-and-Schemes/BSOHSAS-18001/ |title=BS OHSAS 18001 Occupational Health and Safety |publisher=BSI Group |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National legislation and public organizations==
{{Main article|List of occupational safety and health agencies}}

Occupational safety and health practice vary among nations with different approaches to legislation, regulation, enforcement, and incentives for compliance. In the EU, for example, some member states promote OSH by providing public monies as subsidies, grants or financing, while others have created tax system incentives for OSH investments. A third group of EU member states has experimented with using workplace accident insurance premium discounts for companies or organisations with strong OSH records.&lt;ref&gt;See European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2004): “Effectiveness of economic incentives to improve occupational safety and health”, Forum # 14, Bilbao, Spain: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, {{ISBN|92-9191-119-4}}, http://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/forum/14/view or Elsler, D.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], the Commonwealth, four of the six states and both territories have enacted and administer harmonised Work Health and Safety Legislation in accordance with the ''Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.coag.gov.au/node/276|title=Intergovernmental Agreement for Regulatory and Operational Reform in Occupational Health and Safety {{!}} Council of Australian Governments (COAG)|website=www.coag.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these jurisdictions has enacted Work Health &amp; Safety legislation and regulations based on the Commonwealth Work Health and Safety Act 2011 and common Codes of Practice developed by [[Safe Work Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au/sites/swa/model-whs-laws/pages/model-whs-laws|title=Model work health and safety laws - Safe Work Australia|website=www.safeworkaustralia.gov.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some jurisdictions have also included mine safety under the model approach, however, most have retained separate legislation for the time being. Western Australia intends to adopt a moderated version of the model approach and Victoria has retained its own regime, although the Model WHS laws themselves drew heavily on the Victoria approach.

=== Canada ===
In [[Canada]], workers are covered by provincial or federal labour codes depending on the sector in which they work. Workers covered by federal legislation (including those in mining, transportation, and federal employment) are covered by the Canada Labour Code; all other workers are covered by the health and safety legislation of the province in which they work. The [[Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]] (CCOHS), an agency of the Government of Canada, was created in 1966 by an Act of Parliament. The act was based on the belief that all Canadians had "...a fundamental right to a healthy and safe working environment." CCOHS is mandated to promote safe and healthy workplaces to help prevent work-related injuries and illnesses.  The CCOHS maintains a useful (partial) list of OSH regulations for Canada and its provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/legislation/fulllist.html|title=CCOHS: Web Information Service: Canadian enviroOSH Legislation plus Standards|website=www.ccohs.ca|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], [[member state]]s have enforcing authorities to ensure that the basic legal requirements relating to occupational health and safety are met. In many EU countries, there is strong cooperation between employer and worker organisations (e.g. unions) to ensure good OSH performance as it is recognized this has benefits for both the worker (through maintenance of health) and the enterprise (through improved [[productivity]] and [[Quality (business)|quality]]). In 1996, the [[European Agency for Safety and Health at Work]] was founded.

Member states of the [[European Union]] have all transposed into their national legislation a series of directives that establish minimum standards on occupational health and safety. These directives (of which there are about 20 on a variety of topics) follow a similar structure requiring the employer to assess the workplace risks and put in place preventive measures based on a [[Hierarchy of hazard control|hierarchy of control]]. This hierarchy starts with elimination of the hazard and ends with [[personal protective equipment]].

However, certain EU member states admit to having lacking quality control in occupational safety services, to situations in which risk analysis takes place without any on-site workplace visits and to insufficient implementation of certain EU OSH directives. Based on this, it is hardly surprising that the total societal costs of work-related health problems and accidents vary from 2.6% to 3.8% of GNP between the EU member states.&lt;ref&gt;See p. 2-4 of European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2001): "Quality of Work ‘A future Community strategy for safety and health at work’, FORUM # 1, downloadable from: http://osha.europa.eu/en/publications/forum/1/view.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Denmark====
In [[Denmark]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the Danish Act on Working Environment and cooperation at the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Siden kan ikke findes|url = http://www.nyidanmark.dk/en-us/Integration/online_danish/working_in_denmark/occupational_safety_and_health_at_the_workplace/how_a_good_working_environment_is_secured_in_denmark.htm|website = www.nyidanmark.dk|accessdate = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish Working Environment Authority carries out inspections of companies, draws up more detailed rules on health and safety at work and provides information on health and safety at work.&lt;ref&gt;English web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority, http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/en/engelsk/wea.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The result of each inspection is made public on the web pages of the Danish Working Environment Authority so that the general public, current and prospective employees, customers and other stakeholders can inform themselves about whether a given organization has passed the inspection, should they wish to do so.&lt;ref&gt;The inspection results can be found from the main page of the Danish Working Environment Authority at: http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/da/ under the heading "Smiley Status". See also http://arbejdstilsynet.dk/en/engelsk/inspection/smiley-26-6-07.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Spain====
In [[Spain]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the Spanish Act on Prevention of Labour Risks. The Ministry of Employment and Social Security is the authority responsible for issues relating to labour environment.&lt;ref name="Ministry of Employment"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Employment and Social Security: Home page|url=http://www.empleo.gob.es/en/index.htm|website=www.empleo.gob.es|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institute for Labour Safety and Hygiene is the technical public Organization specialized in occupational safety and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Instituto Nacional de Seguridad e Higiene en el Trabajo (INSHT)|url=http://www.insht.es/portal/site/Insht/|website=www.insht.es|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sweden====
In [[Sweden]], occupational safety and health is regulated by the [http://www.av.se/inenglish/lawandjustice/workact/ Work Environment Act]. The [[Swedish Work Environment Authority]] is the [[government agency]] responsible for issues relating to the working environment. The agency should work to disseminate information and furnish advice on OSH, has a mandate to carry out inspections, and a right to issue stipulations and injunctions to any non-compliant employer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welcome to Swedish Work Environment Authority|url=http://www.av.se/inenglish/|publisher=[[Swedish Work Environment Authority]]|accessdate=12 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom====
In the [[UK]], health and safety legislation is drawn up and enforced by the [[Health and Safety Executive]] and local authorities (the local council) under the [[Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 (1974.c37)|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1974/37|website=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health and Safety Executive (2009): A Guide to Safety and Health Regulation in Great Britain. 4th edition. {{ISBN|978-0-7176-6319-4}}, http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/web42.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; (HASAWA).  HASAWA introduced (section 2) a general duty on an employer to ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, the health, safety and welfare at work of all his employees; with the intention of giving a legal framework supporting 'codes of practice' not in themselves having legal force but establishing a strong presumption as to what was reasonably practicable (deviations from them could be justified by appropriate risk assessment).  The previous reliance on detailed prescriptive rule-setting was seen as having failed to respond rapidly enough to technological change, leaving new technologies potentially un-regulated or inappropriately regulated.&lt;ref&gt;see Second Reading debate - {{cite journal|title=HEALTH AND SAFETY AT WORK ETC. BILL|journal=Hansard House of Commons Debates|date=3 April 1974|volume=871 cc1286-394|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1974/apr/03/health-and-safety-at-work-etc-bill#S5CV0871P0_19740403_HOC_290|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;see -for example- the section on '''The Board of Trade's Administration''' {{cite web|last1=Commissioner for Wrecks|title=Report on the Loss of the "Titanic." (s.s.|url=http://www.titanicinquiry.org/BOTInq/BOT01.php|website=Titanic Inquiry Project|publisher=Board of Trade|accessdate=15 July 2014|location=London|year=1912}}: regulations had been made on both provision of lifeboats and subdivision by watertight bulkheads and had not been updated to keep pace with increases in ship size - the BoT was in the process of consulting interested parties&lt;/ref&gt;  HSE has continued to make some regulations giving absolute duties (where something must be done with no 'reasonable practicability' test) but in the UK the regulatory trend is away from prescriptive rules, and towards 'goal setting' and risk assessment. Recent major changes to the laws governing asbestos and fire safety management embrace the concept of risk assessment. The other key aspect of the UK legislation is a statutory mechanism for worker involvement through elected health and safety representatives and health and safety committees. This followed a similar approach in Scandinavia, and that approach has since been adopted in Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Malaysia, for example.

For the UK, the government organisation dealing with occupational health has been the [[Employment Medical Advisory Service]] but in 2014 a new occupational health organisation - the [[Health and Work Service]] - was created to provide advice and assistance to employers in order to get back to work employees on long-term sick-leave.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-26105246|title=New Health and Work Service to get long-term sick back to work|website=BBC News|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service, funded by government, will offer medical assessments and treatment plans, on a voluntary basis, to people on long-term absence from their employer; in return, the government will no longer foot the bill for [[Statutory Sick Pay]] provided by the employer to the individual.

===India===
In [[India]], the Labour Ministry formulates national policies on occupational safety and health in factories and docks with advice and assistance from Directorate General of Factory Advice Service and Labour Institutes (DGFASLI), and enforces its Policies through inspectorates of factories and inspectorates of dock safety.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dgfasli.nic.in/about1.htm|title=About DGFASLI- Directorate General, Factory Advice service and Labour Institutes|website=www.dgfasli.nic.in|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGFASLI is the technical arm of the Ministry of Labour &amp; Employment, Government of India and advises the factories on various problems concerning safety, health, efficiency and well - being of the persons at work places.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The DGFASLI provides technical support in formulating rules, conducting occupational safety surveys and also for conducting occupational safety training programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GL3_1JyReisC|title=Challenges of Occupational Safety and Health: Thrust : Safety in Transportation|last=Chaturvedi|first=Pradeep|date=2006-01-01|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|isbn=9788180692840|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indonesia ===
In [[Indonesia]], the [[Cabinet of Indonesia|Ministry of Manpower]] is responsible to ensure the safety, health and welfare of workers while working, in a factory, or even the area surrounding the factory where labourers work. There are a few rules that control the safety of workers, for example Occupational Safety Act 1970 or Occupational Health Act 1992&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gajimu.com/pekerjaan-yanglayak/keselamatan-dan-kesehatan-kerja/pertanyaan-mengenai-keselamatan-dan-kesehatan-kerja-di-indonesia-1|title=Pertanyaan mengenai Keselamatan dan Kesehatan Kerja di Indonesia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The sanctions, however, are still low and the violations of these laws are still at a high rate - with a maximum of 15 million rupiahs fine and/or a maximum of 1 year in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.xperthr.co.uk/international-manual/indonesia-health-and-safety/155684/|title=Indonesia Health and Safety|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Malaysia ===
In [[Malaysia]], the Department of Occupational Safety and Health (DOSH) under the Ministry of Human Resource is responsible to ensure that the safety, health and welfare of workers in both the public and private sector is upheld. DOSH is responsible to enforce the Factories and Machinery Act 1967 and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act 1994]].

=== People's Republic of China ===
[[File:Hardware stores in China specializing in safety equipment, etc - 02.jpg|thumb|Hardware stores in China specializing in safety equipment]]
In the [[People's Republic of China]], the Ministry of Health is responsible for occupational disease prevention and the State Administration of Work Safety for safety issues at work. On the provincial and municipal level, there are Health Supervisions for occupational health and local bureaus of Work Safety for safety. The "Occupational Disease Control Act of PRC" came into force on May 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"Occupational Disease Control Act of the People's Republic of China"  http://www.gov.cn/banshi/2005-08/01/content_19003.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and Work safety Act of PRC on November 1, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;"The Work Safety Act of the People's Republic of China"  http://www.gov.cn/ztzl/2006-05/27/content_292725.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Occupational Disease Control Act is under revision. The prevention of occupational disease is still in its initial stage compared with industrialised countries such as the US or UK.

=== Singapore ===
In [[Singapore]], the [[Ministry of Manpower (Singapore)|Ministry of Manpower]] operates various checks and campaigns against unsafe work practices, such as when working at height, operating cranes and in traffic management. Examples include Operation Cormorant and the Falls Prevention Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/manpower/more-workers-die-in-falls-from-height|title=More workers die in falls from height|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In [[South Africa]] the Department of Labour is responsible for occupational health and safety inspection and enforcement in commerce and industry apart from mining and energy production, where the Department of Mineral Resources is responsible.

The main statutory legislation on Health and Safety in the jurisdiction of the Department of Labour is ''Act No. 85 of 1993: Occupational Health and Safety Act as amended by Occupational Health and Safety Amendment Act, No. 181 Of 1993.''

Regulations to the OHS Act include:
* ''General Administrative Regulations, 2003''&lt;ref&gt;General Administrative Regulations, 2003 of the South \african Occupational Health and Safety Act, 1993. Government Notice R929 in Government Gazette #25129 of 25 June 2003 Government Printer, Pretoria&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taiwan===
In [[Taiwan]], the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] of the [[Ministry of Labor (Taiwan)|Ministry of Labor]] is in charge of occupational safety and health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Introduction|url = http://www.osha.gov.tw/eng/index.php?code=list&amp;ids=329|website = Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Ministry of Labour|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The matter is governed under the Occupational Safety and Health Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Occupational Safety and Health Act|url = http://law.moj.gov.tw/Eng/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?PCode=N0060001|website = Laws &amp; Regulations Database of the Republic of China|accessdate = 2015-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2007, official release the document TOSHMS ([[Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System]]), which defined the basic rule about occupational safety standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toshms.org.tw/ TOSHMS台灣職業安全衛生管理系統資訊網] Taiwan Occupational Safety and Health Management System website&lt;/ref&gt;
===United Arab Emirates===
[[OSHAD]] was introduced in February 2010 to regulate the implementation of occupational health and safety in the emirates of Abu Dhabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oshad.ae/en/Pages/Aboutcenter.aspx|title=Pages - About Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
In the [[United States]], President [[Richard Nixon]] signed the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act]] into law on December 29, 1970. The act created the three agencies that administer it. They include the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], and the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.&lt;ref&gt;Della-Giustina, Daniel E. (2000). Developing a Safety and Health Program, New York: Lewis Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; The act authorized the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to regulate private employers in the 50 states, the District of Columbia, and territories.&lt;ref&gt;U. S. Department of Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Retrieved on November 28, 2003, from http://www.osha.gov&lt;/ref&gt; The Act establishing it includes a [[general duty clause]] (29 U.S.C. § 654, 5(a)) requiring an employer to comply with the Act and regulations derived from it, and to provide employees with "employment and a place of employment which are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm to his employees."

OSHA was established in 1971 under the Department of Labor. It has headquarters in Washington, DC and ten regional offices, further broken down into districts, each organized into three sections; compliance, training, and assistance. Its stated mission is ''to assure safe and healthful working conditions for working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and by providing training, outreach, education and assistance.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About OSHA|url=https://www.osha.gov/about.html|website=OSHA|publisher=US Department of Labor|accessdate=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original plan was for OSHA to oversee 50 state plans with OSHA funding 50% of each plan. Unfortunately it has not worked out that way. 
There are currently 26 approved state plans (4 cover only public employees)&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt; and no other states want to participate. OSHA manages the plan in the states not participating.&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt;

OSHA develops safety standards in the Code of Federal Regulation and enforces those safety standards through compliance inspections conducted by Compliance Officers; enforcement resources are focussed on high-hazard industries. Worksites may apply to enter OSHA's Voluntary Protection Program (VPP); a successful application leads to an on-site inspection ; if this is passed the site gains VPP status and OSHA no longer inspect it annually nor (normally) visit it unless there is a fatal accident or an employee complaint until VPP revalidation (after 3–5 years)&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt;(VPP sites have injury and illness rates less than half the average for their industry).

It has 73 specialists in local offices to provide tailored information and training to employers and employees at little or no cost&lt;ref name="Fanning"/&gt; Similarly OSHA produces a range of publications, provides advice to employers and funds consultation services available for small businesses.

OSHA's Alliance Program enables groups committed to worker safety and health to work with it to develop compliance assistance tools and resources, share information with workers and employers, and educate them about their rights and responsibilities. OSHA also has a Strategic Partnership Program that zeros in on specific hazards or specific geographic areas.&lt;ref name=AAO /&gt;
OSHA manages Susan B. Harwood grants to nonprofit companies to train workers and employers to recognize, avoid, and prevent safety and health hazards in the workplace. Grants focus on small business, hard-to-reach workers and high-hazard industries.

The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]], created under the same act, works closely with OSHA and provides the research behind many of OSHA's regulations and standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/about/|title=CDC - NIOSH - About NIOSH|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional roles and responsibilities==
The roles and responsibilities of OSH professionals vary regionally, but may include evaluating working environments, developing, endorsing and encouraging measures that might prevent injuries and illnesses, providing OSH information to employers, employees, and the public, providing medical examinations, and assessing the success of worker health programs.

===Europe===
In Norway, the main required tasks of an occupational health and safety practitioner include the following:
* Systematic evaluations of the working environment
* Endorsing preventative measures which eliminate causes of illnesses in the workplace
* Providing information on the subject of employees’ health
* Providing information on occupational hygiene, ergonomics, and environmental and safety risks in the workplace&lt;ref&gt;Hale A, Ytehus I, 2004, ‘Changing requirements for the safety profession:  roles and tasks’, Journal of Occupational Health &amp; Safety – Australia and New Zealand&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Netherlands, the required tasks for health and safety staff are only summarily defined and include the following:
* Providing voluntary medical examinations
* Providing a consulting room on the work environment to the workers
* Providing health assessments (if needed for the job concerned)&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"&gt;Hale, A et alia.  2004&lt;/ref&gt;

‘The main influence of the Dutch law on the job of the safety professional is through the requirement on each employer to use the services of a certified working conditions service to advise them on health and safety’.&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/&gt;  A ‘certified service’ must employ sufficient numbers of four types of certified experts to cover the risks in the organisations which use the service:
* A safety professional
* An occupational hygienist
* An occupational physician
* A work and organisation specialist.&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/&gt;

In 2004, 37% of health and safety practitioners in Norway and 14% in the Netherlands had an MSc; 44% had a BSc in Norway and 63% in the Netherlands; and 19% had training as an OSH technician in Norway and 23% in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name="Hale, A et alia. 2004"/&gt;

===US===
[[File:Occupational Safety Equipment.jpg|thumbnail|right|Leather craftsman gloves, safety goggles, and a properly fitted hardhat are crucial for proper safety in a construction environment.]]
The main tasks undertaken by the OHS practitioner in the US include:
* Develop processes, procedures, criteria, requirements, and methods to attain the best possible management of the hazards and exposures that can cause injury to people, and damage property, or the environment;
* Apply good business practices and economic principles for efficient use of resources to add to the importance of the safety processes;
* Promote other members of the company to contribute by exchanging ideas and other different approaches to make sure that every one in the corporation possess OHS knowledge and have functional roles in the development and execution of safety procedures;
* Assess services, outcomes, methods, equipment, workstations, and procedures by using qualitative and quantitative methods to recognise the hazards and measure the related risks;
* Examine all possibilities, effectiveness, reliability, and expenditure to attain the best results for the company concerned&lt;ref&gt;Board of Certified Safety Professionals, 2012, "Safety Fundamentals" and "Comprehensive Practice" blueprints, accessed 17 February at http://www.bcsp.org/csp&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowledge required by the OHS professional in the US include:
* Constitutional and case law controlling safety, health, and the environment
* Operational procedures to plan/develop safe work practices
* Safety, health and environmental sciences
* Design of hazard control systems (i.e.  fall protection, scaffoldings)
* Design of recordkeeping systems that take collection into account, as well as storage, interpretation, and dissemination
* Mathematics and statistics
* Processes and systems for attaining safety through design&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Board of Certified Safety Professionals, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Some skills required by the OHS professional in the US include (but are not limited to):
* Understanding and relating to systems, policies and rules
* Holding checks and having control methods for possible hazardous exposures
* Mathematical and statistical analysis
* Examining manufacturing hazards
* Planning safe work practices for systems, facilities, and equipment
* Understanding and using safety, health, and environmental science information for the improvement of procedures
* Interpersonal communication skills&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Differences between countries and regions==
Because different countries take different approaches to ensuring occupational safety and health, areas of OSH need and focus also vary between countries and regions. Similar to the findings of the ENHSPO survey conducted in Australia, the Institute of Occupational Medicine in the UK found that there is a need to put greater emphasis on work-related illness in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous.  2008.  ‘Occupational Health’, Health and Safety News:  In Brief, Vol 60, Iss. 3;  UK.  pg. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  In contrast, in Australia and the US, a major responsibility of the OHS professional is to keep company directors and managers aware of the issues that they face in regards to occupational health and safety principles and legislation.  However, in some other areas of Europe, it is precisely this which has been lacking: “Nearly half of senior managers and company directors do not have an up-to-date understanding of their health and safety-related duties and responsibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Paton, Nic.  2008.  ‘Senior Managers Fail to Show Competence in Health and Safety’ Occupational Health, Vol. 60, Iss. 3; p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identifying safety and health hazards==

===Hazards, risks, outcomes===
The terminology used in OSH varies between countries, but generally speaking:
* A [[hazard]] is something that can cause harm if not controlled.
* The outcome is the harm that results from an uncontrolled hazard.
* A [[risk]] is a combination of the probability that a particular outcome will occur and the severity of the harm involved.&lt;ref name="Risk basic definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=www.riskmanagementinsight.com|url=http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf|accessdate=16 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141118061526/http://www.riskmanagementinsight.com/media/docs/FAIR_introduction.pdf|archivedate=18 November 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“Hazard”, “risk”, and “outcome” are used in other fields to describe e.g. environmental damage, or damage to equipment. However, in the context of OSH, “harm” generally describes the direct or indirect degradation, temporary or permanent, of the physical, mental, or social well-being of workers. For example, repetitively carrying out [[manual handling]] of heavy objects is a hazard. The outcome could be a [[Musculoskeletal disorders|musculoskeletal disorder]] (MSD) or an acute back or joint injury.  The risk can be expressed numerically (e.g. a 0.5 or 50/50 chance of the outcome occurring during a year), in relative terms (e.g. "high/medium/low"), or with a multi-dimensional classification scheme (e.g. situation-specific risks).{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Hazard identification===
Hazard identification or assessment is an important step in the overall risk assessment and risk management process. It is where individual work hazards are identified, assessed and controlled/eliminated as close to source (location of the hazard) as reasonably as possible. As technology, resources, social expectation or regulatory requirements change, hazard analysis focuses controls more closely toward the source of the hazard. Thus hazard control is a dynamic program of prevention. Hazard-based programs also have the advantage of not assigning or implying there are "acceptable risks" in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Öztaş|first=Dilek|last2=Kurt|first2=Burak|last3=Koç|first3=Ayşegül|last4=Akbaba|first4=Muhsin|date=2018-07-03|title=Living Conditions, Access to Healthcare Services, and Occupational Health and Safety Conditions of Migrant Seasonal Agricultural Workers in the Çukurova Region|journal=Journal of Agromedicine|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=262–269|doi=10.1080/1059924x.2018.1470048|pmid=30047859|issn=1059-924X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A hazard-based program may not be able to eliminate all risks, but neither does it accept "satisfactory" – but still risky – outcomes. And as those who calculate and manage the risk are usually managers while those exposed to the risks are a different group, workers, a hazard-based approach can by-pass conflict inherent in a risk-based approach. {{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The information that needs to be gathered from sources should apply to the specific type of work from which the hazards can come from. As mentioned previously, examples of these sources include interviews with people who have worked in the field of the hazard, history and analysis of past incidents, and official reports of work and the hazards encountered. Of these, the personnel interviews may be the most critical in identifying undocumented practices, events, releases, hazards and other relevant information. Once the information is gathered from a collection of sources, it is recommended for these to be digitally archived (to allow for quick searching) and to have a physical set of the same information in order for it to be more accessible. One innovative way to display the complex historical hazard information is with a historical hazards identification map, which distills the hazard information into an easy to use graphical format.

===Risk assessment===
{{Further information|Risk assessment#Risk assessment }}
Modern occupational safety and health legislation usually demands that a [[risk assessment]] be carried out prior to making an intervention. It should be kept in mind that risk management requires risk to be managed to a level which is as low as is reasonably practical.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

This assessment should:
* Identify the hazards
* Identify all affected by the hazard and how
* Evaluate the risk
* Identify and prioritize appropriate control measures{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The calculation of risk is based on the likelihood or [[probability]] of the harm being realized and the severity of the consequences. This can be expressed mathematically as a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] assessment (by assigning low, medium and high likelihood and severity with integers and multiplying them to obtain a [[risk factor]]), or qualitatively as a description of the circumstances by which the harm could arise.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

The assessment should be recorded and reviewed periodically and whenever there is a significant change to work practices. The assessment should include practical recommendations to control the risk. Once recommended controls are implemented, the risk should be re-calculated to determine if it has been lowered to an acceptable level. Generally speaking, newly introduced controls should lower risk by one level, i.e., from high to medium or from medium to low.&lt;ref&gt;Stephan, Constantin (2012), Industrial Health, Safety and Environmental Management, epubli, Berlin, 3rd edition 2012, {{ISBN|978-3-7418-7478-9}}, pp. 70-71&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary developments==
On an international scale, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have begun focusing on labour environments in developing nations with projects such as [[Healthy city|Healthy Cities]].&lt;ref&gt;Swuste, P., Eijkemans, G. "Occupational safety, health, and hygiene in the urban informal sector of Sub-Saharan Africa: An application of the prevention and control exchange (PACE) program to the..." International Journal of Occupational and Environmental Health. Abel Publications Services Inc. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these developing countries are stuck in a situation in which their relative lack of resources to invest in OSH leads to increased costs due to work-related illnesses and accidents. As a 2007 Factsheet from the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work states: "Countries with less developed OSH systems spend a far higher percentage of GDP on work-related injury and illness – taking resources away from more productive activities&amp;nbsp;... The ILO estimates that work-related illness and accidents cost up to 10% of GDP in Latin America, compared with just 2.6% to 3.8% in the EU."&lt;ref&gt;European Agency for Safety and Health at Work (2007): Facts 76/EN National economics and occupational safety and health. Bilbao, Spain: European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, {{ISSN|1681-2123}}.&lt;/ref&gt; There is continued use of asbestos, a notorious hazard, in some developing countries. So asbestos-related disease is, sadly, expected to continue to be a significant problem well into the future.

===Nanotechnology===
{{See also|Health implications of nanotechnology}}

[[File:Nano containment hood.PNG|thumb|right|A nanomaterial containment hood, an example of an engineering control used to protect workers handling them on a regular basis.]]
[[Nanotechnology]] is an example of a new, relatively unstudied technology. A Swiss survey of one hundred thirty eight companies using or producing nanoparticulate matter in 2006 resulted in forty completed questionnaires.  Sixty five per cent of respondent companies stated they did not have a formal risk assessment process for dealing with nanoparticulate matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovationsgesellschaft.ch/images/fremde_publikationen/Nature_Public_concern.pdf|title=Risks and nanotechnology: the public is more concerned than experts and industry|year=2007|publisher=Nature Publishing Group|accessdate=20 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nanotechnology already presents new issues for OSH professionals that will only become more difficult as nanostructures become more complex.  The size of the particles renders most containment and personal protective equipment ineffective.  The toxicology values for macro sized industrial substances are rendered inaccurate due to the unique nature of nanoparticulate matter.  As nanoparticulate matter decreases in size its relative surface area increases dramatically, increasing any catalytic effect or chemical reactivity substantially versus the known value for the macro substance.  This presents a new set of challenges in the near future to rethink contemporary measures to safeguard the health and welfare of employees against a nanoparticulate substance that most conventional controls have not been designed to manage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nanowerk.com/spotlight/spotid=1781.php |title=Nanotechnology risks – the real issues |doi=10.1016/j.techsoc.2004.10.005 |publisher=Nanowerk.com |date= |accessdate=2013-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occupational Health Disparities===
'''Occupational health disparities''' refer to differences in occupational injuries and illnesses that are closely linked with demographic, social, cultural, economic, and/or political factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/programs/ohd/risks.html|title=CDC - NIOSH Program Portfolio : Occupational Health Disparities : Risks|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
There are multiple levels of training applicable to the field of occupational safety and health (OSH). Programs range from individual non-credit certificates, focusing on specific areas of concern, to full doctoral programs. The [[University of Southern California]] was one of the first schools in the US to offer a Ph.D. program focusing on the field. Further, multiple master's degree programs exist, such as that of the [[Indiana State University]] who offer a master of science (MS) and a master of arts (MA) in OSH. Graduate programs are designed to train educators, as well as, high-level practitioners. Many OSH generalists focus on undergraduate studies; programs within schools, such as that of the [[University of North Carolina]]'s online Bachelor of Science in Environmental Health and Safety, fill a large majority of hygienist needs. However, smaller companies often don’t have full-time safety specialists on staff, thus, they appoint a current employee to the responsibility. Individuals finding themselves in positions such as these, or for those enhancing marketability in the job-search and promotion arena, may seek out a credit certificate program. For example, the [[University of Connecticut]]'s online OSH Certificate,&lt;ref name="UConn Credit Online OSH Certificate"&gt;{{cite web |title=University of Connecticut Online OSH Certificate|url=http://osh.uconn.edu|accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides students familiarity with overarching concepts through a 15-credit (5-course) program. Programs such as these are often adequate tools in building a strong educational platform for new safety managers with a minimal outlay of time and money. Further, most hygienists seek certification by organizations which train in specific areas of concentration, focusing on isolated workplace hazards. The American Society for Safety Engineers (ASSE), American Board of Industrial Hygiene (ABIH), and [[American Industrial Hygiene Association]] (AIHA) offer individual certificates on many different subjects from forklift operation to waste disposal and are the chief facilitators of continuing education in the OSH sector. In the U.S. the training of safety professionals is supported by [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] through their [[NIOSH Education and Research Centers]].
In Australia, training in OSH is available at the vocational education and training level, and at university undergraduate and postgraduate level. Such university courses may be accredited by an Accreditation Board of the Safety Institute of Australia. The Institute has produced a Body of Knowledge&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohsbok.org.au/|title=The OHS Body of Knowledge|last=Knowledge|first=The OHS Body of|website=www.ohsbok.org.au|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; which it considers is required by a generalist safety and health professional, and offers a professional qualification based on a four-step assessment.

==World Day for Safety and Health at Work==
{{main article | Workers' Memorial Day}}

On April 28 The [[International Labour Organization]] celebrates "World Day for Safety and Health"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/events/safeday/lang--en/index.htm|title=World Day for Safety and Health at Work (Occupational Safety and Health)|website=www.ilo.org|language=en|access-date=2016-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[raising awareness|raise awareness]] of safety in the workplace.

'''PICRUSt'''&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Langille|first1=Morgan G I|last2=Zaneveld|first2=Jesse|last3=Caporaso|first3=J Gregory|last4=McDonald|first4=Daniel|last5=Knights|first5=Dan|last6=Reyes|first6=Joshua A|last7=Clemente|first7=Jose C|last8=Burkepile|first8=Deron E|last9=Vega Thurber|first9=Rebecca L|last10=Knight|first10=Rob|last11=Beiko|first11=Robert G|last12=Huttenhower|first12=Curtis|title=Predictive functional profiling of microbial communities using 16S rRNA marker gene sequences|journal=Nature Biotechnology|volume=31|issue=9|year=2013|pages=814–821|issn=1087-0156|doi=10.1038/nbt.2676|pmid=23975157|pmc=3819121|url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/12064405/3819121.pdf?sequence=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
is a [[bioinformatics]] software package. The name is an abbreviation for ''Phylogenetic Investigation of Communities by Reconstruction
of Unobserved States''.

The tool serves in the field of [[metagenomic]] analysis where it allows inference of the functional profile of a [[microbial]]
community based on [[marker gene]] survey along one or more samples. In essence, PICRUSt takes a user supplied [[Operational taxonomic unit|OTU]] table, representing the marker gene sequences (most commonly a [[16S ribosomal RNA|16S]] [[Cluster analysis|cluster]]) accompanied with its relative abundance in each of the samples. The output of PICRUSt is a sample by functional-gene-count matrix, telling the count of each functional-gene in each of the samples surveyed. The ability of PICRUSt to estimate the functional-gene profile for a given sample relies on a set of known sequenced [[genomes]].  This could also be thought of as an automated alternative to manually researching the gene families likely to be present in organisms whose sequences are found in a [[16S ribosomal RNA]] [[amplicon library]].

==Genome prediction algorithm==

In an initial preprocessing phase, PICRUSt constructs [[confidence intervals]] and point predictions for the number of copies of each gene family in each bacterial and archaeal strain in a reference tree, using organisms with sequenced genomes as a reference. More specifically, for each gene family, PICRUSt maps known gene copy numbers (from complete sequenced genomes) onto a reference tree of life.  These gene family [[copy numbers]] are treated as [[continuous traits]], and an [[evolutionary model]] constructed under the assumption of [[Brownian Motion]]. These evolutionary models can be constructed with either [[Maximum Likelihood]], [[Relaxed Maximum Likelihood]] or [[Wagner Parsimony]]  This evolutionary model is then used to predict both a point estimate and a confidence interval for the copy number of microorganisms without sequenced genomes.  This 'genome prediction' step produces a large table of bacterial types (specifically [[operational taxonomic units]] or OTUs) vs. gene family copy numbers. This table is distributed to end users. It is important to note that this prediction method is not the same as a nearest neighbor approach (i.e. just looking up the nearest sequenced genome), and was shown to give a small but significant improvement in accuracy over that strategy.  However, [[nearest neighbor search|nearest neighbor]] prediction is available as an option in PICRUSt.

Notably, while this functionality is typically used for prediction of gene copy numbers in bacteria, it could, in principle, be used for prediction of any other [[continuous trait]] given trait data for diverse organisms and a reference [[phylogeny]].

Langille et al&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013" /&gt; tested the accuracy of this genome prediction step using leave-one-out cross validation on the input set of sequenced genomes.  Additional tests examined sensitivity to errors in [[phylogenetic inference]], [[lack of genomic data]], and the accuracy of the [[confidence intervals]] on gene content.

A similar step predicts the copy number of [[16S rRNA]] genes.

==Metagenome prediction algorithm==

When applying PICRUSt to a [[16S rRNA]] gene library, PICRUSt matches reference [[operational taxonomic units]] against the tables, and retrieves a predicted 16S rRNA copy number and gene copy number for each gene family.  The abundance of each OTU is divided by its predicted copy number (if a bacterium has multiple 16S copies, its apparent abundance in 16S rRNA data will be inflated), and then multiplied by the copy number of the gene family.  This gives a prediction for the contribution of each OTU to the overall gene content of the sample (the [[metagenome]]). Finally, these individual contributions are summed together to produce an estimate of the genes present in the [[metagenome]].

Langille et al., 2013&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013" /&gt; tested the accuracy of this genome prediction step by using previously reported datasets in which the same biological sample was subjected to [[16S rRNA gene]] amplification and [[shotgun metagenomics]].  In these cases, the shotgun metagenomic results were taken as a representation of the 'true' community, and the 16S rRNA gene amplicon libraries fed into PICRUSt to attempt to predict those data. Test datasets included [[human microbiome]] samples from the [[Human Microbiome Project]], soil samples, diverse mammalian samples, and samples from the [[Guerrero Negro]] [[microbial mats]]

==The Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index==

Because PICRUSt, and [[evolutionary comparative genomics]] in general, depends on sequenced genomes, biological samples from well-studied environments (many sequenced genomes) will be better predicted than poorly studied environments.  In order to assess how many genomes are available, PICRUSt optionally allows users to calculate a Nearest Sequenced Taxon Index (NSTI) for their samples.  This index reflects the average [[phylogenetic distance]] between each [[16S rRNA]] gene sequence in their sample, and a [[16S rRNA]] gene sequence from a fully [[sequenced genome]]. In general, the lower the NSTI score, the more accurate PICRUSt's predictions are expected to be. For example,&lt;ref name="LangilleZaneveld2013" /&gt; showed that PICRUSt was much more accurate on diverse soil samples and samples from the [[Human Microbiome Project]] than on microbial mat samples from  [[Guerrero Negro]], which contained many bacteria without any sequenced relatives.

Benchmarking showed highly similar performance to PICRUSt when compared on the same datasets. One advantage is that all OTUs, not just those in a reference phylogeny table can be used.  One disadvantage is that confidence intervals and evolutionary models are not constructed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9903">'''Paranoid fiction''' is a term sometimes used to describe works of [[literature]] that explore the [[Subjectivity|subjective]] nature of reality and how it can be manipulated by forces in power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/new_literary_history/v028/28.1flieger.html Postmodern Perspective: The Paranoid Eye. ''New Literary History''.Volume 28, Number 1, Winter 1997, pp. 87-109]&lt;/ref&gt;  These forces can be external, such as a [[totalitarianism|totalitarian]] government, or they can be internal, such as a character's [[mental illness]] or refusal to accept the harshness of the world he or she is in.

Unlike [[speculative fiction]], paranoid fiction is written in a way so as to imply that the story may only be a [[delusion]] of the characters, instead of treating it as an [[alternate history]] or an [[fictional universe|in-fiction universe]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==History==
The elements of paranoid fiction can be seen in works dating as far back as the late 19th and early 20th century. Some of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s novels contained paranoid and psychologically troubled characters set against the dark backdrop of a modernizing [[Russia]]. [[Franz Kafka]], in particular, was known for his exaggerated accounts of what he portrayed as real life in his works, to enhance the absurdity of the life themes they conveyed.  Similarly, [[George Orwell]]'s works, while not as exaggerated, confirmed the practice of using [[dystopia]]n fiction to take a different outlook on highly common themes, including identity and personal desires.

The term ''paranoid fiction'' was first coined to label sensationalistic and off-beat stories as bizarre and thus outside the realm of literary fiction.  Starting after [[World War I]], however, [[modernism|modernists]] began exploring the stranger themes of life in art, in response to the themes of death being effectively mechanized and made impossible to toy with by the war's graphic depictions.  As a result, modernist literature tended to explore the meaning and construction of reality, shifting away from the progressive, cause-and-effect structure of [[Literary realism|realist]] fiction towards a more complex and disjointed depiction of reality.&lt;ref&gt;Lye, John (1997). [http://www.brocku.ca/english/courses/2F55/modernism.html "Some Attributes of Modernist Literature."]&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War II]], [[absurdism|absurdists]] carried this focus one step further by placing these common themes in surreal and fantastic settings, turning what would have been otherwise mundane concepts into distinctive, stand-out ones, thus converting the paranoid fiction genre into a legitimate one.

[[Philip K. Dick]] is most frequently viewed as the forefather of the modern paranoid fiction.  His works were born out of paranoia and hallucination; he had sudden visions of places he'd never been to and events he'd never witnessed, possibly from [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] or an overly active imagination.  These visions were so vivid that Dick put them down on paper, never failing to classify them as only "speculative thought," and thus outside the boundary of conventional thought.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Erik. [http://www.techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html "Philip K. Dick's Divine Interference."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205050412/http://techgnosis.com/pkdnet.html |date=2006-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Dick's works start out uneventfully in a seemingly ordinary setting, then transpose to a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] [[fantasy]], with the characters discovering that what they thought real was in fact a delusion.  Throughout his works, Dick maintained a balance between the expected traits of the [[science fiction]] genre they were also categorized in, and the eccentric and disturbing elements coming from his mind.&lt;ref name="paranoid"&gt;[http://www.strangewords.com/archive/paranoia.html "Strange Words: Paranoid."]&lt;/ref&gt;  A recurring theme in his works is on how reality is perceived and treated differently by people depending on their mindsets.

==Characteristics==

At its most basic, paranoid fiction refers specifically to works about speculations and possible conspiracies by people in power, told by an [[unreliable narrator]].&lt;ref name="paranoid"/&gt;  However, the most popular type of paranoid fiction has proved to be one in which the universe appears on the surface to be definite and real, but upon closer inspection, to actually be deceptive and deliberately misleading.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  In these works, there are either questions raised as to the realness of the world the characters are living in, or a distinction made between a fantasy world and its reality.

Paranoid fiction often overlaps with many other genres, most commonly [[dystopia]]n fiction, [[science fiction]], and [[film noir]], sharing many of its main themes and literary devices.  Generally, however, paranoid fiction avoids explicitly defined themes and concrete [[Motif (literature)|motif]]s in favor of [[allegory|allegories]] and ambiguous [[symbol]]ism to emphasize the dreamlike and unreal nature of the characters' world.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027080230/http://geocities.com/sanmasonic/Paranoid/ "Paranoid Fiction."]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, a purely dystopian work typically explores the mechanisms and motives of the totalitarian state to keep its people under control, whereas one of paranoid fiction would concentrate more on the effects of the state on its inhabitants' mental and [[emotional well-being]], and its implications on the decadent condition of society.  George Orwell's ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' can be viewed as a balance of the two, depicting the Party as crushing free will through a strictly defined [[Newspeak|language]] and constant monitoring, but also through psychological torture and the distorting of people's viewpoints on what is true and what is false.

To further increase their "[[magic realism]]," works of paranoid fiction often employ common devices and archetypes from other genres, including a detective-solving structure, plot twists, or philosophical themes, to create a [[surrealism|surrealistic]] tone and an atmosphere of fear and dread.  Plots also tend to be fanciful and occasionally futuristic to emphasize their inherent absurdity and imaginativeness, but also maintain some measure of realism to comment on how apparently unrealistic stories can, in fact, be (often frighteningly) closer to real life than one might think at first glance.&lt;ref name="sanmasonic"/&gt;

Sometimes paranoid fiction will strongly imply, and occasionally admit outright, that its constructed world is a lie or an illusion.  In this case, the plot will center on the main character's struggle between the physical and spiritual; i.e. the actual world they are in, versus the world they want to see and believe in. Here, the cause of the fantasy is the protagonist's internal desires, doubts, and suspicions.  Such works tend to be more introspective and focused on the individual, than on a community or a regime.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

'''Pennsylvania Humanities Council''' (PHC) is a non-profit affiliate of the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] based in [[Philadelphia, PA|Philadelphia, PA]]. It is one of 56 [[List of state humanities councils|state humanities councils]] founded in the wake of the National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act of 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neh.gov/divisions/fedstate/resource/legislation-councils | title=Legislation for councils}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pennsylvania Humanities Council's office is located at 325 Chestnut Street #715, Philadelphia, PA  19106. The current Executive Director is Laurie Zierer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.neh.gov/humanities/2017/winter/in-focus/executive-function-laurie-zierer | title=Executive Function with Laurie Zierer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The earliest state councils were organized in 1971,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/indicatordoc.aspx?i=78#en_0_1 | title=State Humanities Council Revenues}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Pennsylvania’s council founded as a start-up grant at the University of Pennsylvania. In 1973 the Public Committee for the Humanities in Pennsylvania officially incorporated as a nonprofit at [[Bucknell University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.marketwatch.com/press-release/the-pennsylvania-humanities-council-applauds-the-confirmation-of-dr-william-d-bro-adams-as-the-10th-chairman-of-the-national-endowment-for-the-humanities-2014-07-11 | title=The Pennsylvania Humanities Council Applauds the Confirmation of Dr. William D. Bro Adams as the 10th Chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, the name Pennsylvania Humanities Council (PHC) was established and the organization settled in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pahumanities.org/about-us/a-brief-history | title=A Brief History of PHC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, PHC’s activity consisted almost exclusively of making grants to nonprofit organizations with funds provided by the NEH. During the 1980s and early 1990s, they incorporated staff-directed special projects and packaged programs.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1994, PHC focused on expanding access to the humanities in Pennsylvania beyond groups traditionally interested in cultural events.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; They began to support local groups, working to build the programming capacity of small historical societies, museums, art centers, libraries, senior centers, and community groups.

== Current activities ==
Since 2013, Pennsylvania Humanities Council has shifted its focus to civic engagement, education and humanities advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://pahumanities.org/initiatives | title=PHC Initiatives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Philosophy sidebar}}

In [[philosophy]], '''philosophy of physics''' deals with conceptual and interpretational issues in modern [[physics]], and often overlaps with research done by certain kinds of theoretical physicists. Philosophy of physics can be very broadly lumped into three main areas:
* The interpretations of [[quantum mechanics]]: Concerning issues, mainly, with how to formulate an adequate response to the [[measurement problem]], and understand what the theory tells us about reality.
* The nature of [[space]] and [[time]]: Are space and time substances, or purely relational? Is simultaneity conventional or just relative? Is temporal asymmetry purely reducible to thermodynamic asymmetry?
* Inter-theoretic relations: the relationship between various physical theories, such as [[thermodynamics]] and [[statistical mechanics]]. This overlaps with the issue of scientific reduction.

==Philosophy of space and time==
{{main article|Philosophy of space and time}}

The existence and nature of space and time (or space-time) are central topics in the philosophy of physics.&lt;ref name="MaudlinSTa"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Maudlin|first1=Tim|title=Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691143095|page=xi|url=https://books.google.com/?id=siyNQV8F0y8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=philosophy+of+Physics:+Space+and+Time:+Space+and+Time#v=onepage&amp;q=central%20topic&amp;f=false|accessdate=3 October 2017|language=en|quote=...the existence and nature of space and time (or space-time) is a central topic.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time===
{{Main article| Time in physics}}
[[File:Wooden hourglass.jpg|thumb|right|Time, in many philosophies, is seen as change.]]
[[Time]] is often thought to be a [[fundamental quantity]] (that is, a quantity which cannot be defined in terms of other quantities), because time seems like a fundamentally basic concept, such that one cannot define it in terms of anything simpler. However, certain theories such as [[loop quantum gravity]] claim that spacetime is emergent. As Carlo Rovelli, one of the founders of loop quantum gravity has said: "No more fields on spacetime: just fields on fields".&lt;ref&gt;Rovelli, C. (2004). Quantum Gravity. Cambridge Monographs on Mathematical Physics. p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt; Time is [[define]]d via measurement—by its standard time interval. Currently, the standard time interval (called "conventional [[second]]", or simply "second") is defined as 9,192,631,770 [[oscillations]] of a [[hyperfine]] transition in the 133 [[caesium]] [[atom]]. ([[ISO 31-1]]). What time is and how it works [[Logical consequence|follows from]] the above definition. Time then can be combined mathematically with the fundamental quantities of [[space]] and [[mass]] to define concepts such as [[velocity]], [[momentum]], [[energy]], and [[Field (physics)|fields]].

Both [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Galileo]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Penrose]], 2004. ''[[The Road to Reality]]: A Complete Guide to the Laws of the Universe''. London: Jonathan Cape. {{ISBN|0-224-04447-8}} (hardcover), 0-09-944068-7 (paperback).
&lt;/ref&gt;
as well as most people up until the 20th century, thought that time was the same for everyone everywhere.
Our modern conception of time is based on [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] and [[Hermann Minkowski|Minkowski]]'s [[spacetime]], in which rates of time run differently in different inertial frames of reference, and [[space]] and time are merged into [[spacetime]]. Time may be quantized, with the theoretical smallest time being on the order of the [[Planck time]]. Einstein's [[general relativity]] as well as the [[redshift]] of the light from receding distant galaxies indicate that the entire [[Universe]] and possibly space-time itself began about [[Age of the universe|13.8 billion years ago]] in the [[big bang]]. Einstein's theory of special relativity mostly (though not universally) made theories of time where there is something metaphysically special about the present seem much less plausible, as the reference-frame-dependence of time seems to not allow the idea of a privileged present moment.

===Time travel===
{{Main article| Time travel}}
Some theories, most notably special and general relativity, suggest that suitable geometries of [[spacetime]], or certain types of motion in [[space]], may allow time travel into the past and future. Concepts that aid such understanding include the [[closed timelike curve]].

[[Albert Einstein]]'s special theory of relativity (and, by extension, the general theory) predicts [[time dilation]] that could be interpreted as time travel. The theory states that, relative to a stationary observer, time appears to pass more slowly for faster-moving bodies: for example, a moving clock will appear to run slow; as a clock approaches the speed of light its hands will appear to nearly stop moving. The effects of this sort of time dilation are discussed further in the popular "[[twin paradox]]".  These results are experimentally observable and affect the operation of GPS satellites and other high-tech systems used in daily life.

A second, similar type of time travel is permitted by [[general relativity]]. In this type a distant observer sees time passing more slowly for a clock at the bottom of a deep [[gravity well]], and a clock lowered into a deep gravity well and pulled back up will indicate that less time has passed compared to a stationary clock that stayed with the distant observer.

These effects are to some degree similar to [[hibernation]], or cooling of live objects (which slow down the rates of chemical processes in the subject) almost indefinitely suspending their life thus resulting in "time travel" toward the future, but never backward. They do not violate [[causality]]. This is not typical of the "time travel" featured in science fiction (where causality is violated at will), and there is little doubt surrounding its existence. "Time travel" will hereafter refer to travel with some degree of freedom into the past ''or'' future of [[proper time]].

Many in the scientific community believe that backward time travel is highly unlikely, because it violates [[causality]]&lt;ref name="Bolonkin"&gt;{{cite book |title=Universe, Human mmortality and Future Human Evaluation |edition= |first1=Alexander |last1=Bolonkin |publisher=Elsevier |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-12-415810-8 |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IFZWTf93KwgC}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=IFZWTf93KwgC&amp;pg=PA32 Extract of page 32]&lt;/ref&gt; i.e. the logic of cause and effect. For example, what happens if you attempt to go back in time and kill yourself at an earlier stage in your life (or your grandfather, which leads to the [[grandfather paradox]])? [[Stephen Hawking]] once suggested that the absence of tourists from the future constitutes a strong argument against the existence of time travel&amp;mdash; a variant of the [[Fermi paradox]], with time travelers instead of alien visitors.&lt;ref name="Bolonkin" /&gt;

===Space===
{{Main article|Space}}

Space is one of the few fundamental quantities in [[physics]], meaning that it cannot be defined via other quantities because there is nothing more fundamental known at present. Thus, similar to the definition of other fundamental quantities (like [[time]] and [[mass]]), space is defined via [[measurement]]. Currently, the standard space interval, called a standard metre or simply metre, is defined as the [[speed of light|distance traveled by light in a vacuum]] during a time interval of 1/299792458 of a second (exact).

In [[classical physics]], space is a three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] where any position can be described using three [[coordinate system|coordinate]]s and parameterised by time.  Special and general relativity use four-dimensional [[spacetime]] rather than three-dimensional space; and currently there are many speculative theories which use more than four spatial dimensions.

==Philosophy of quantum mechanics==
{{Main article|Interpretation of quantum mechanics}}
Quantum mechanics is a large focus of contemporary philosophy of physics, specifically concerning the correct interpretation of quantum mechanics. Very broadly, much of the philosophical work that is done in quantum theory is trying to make sense of superposition states:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8k_2oD66mI&amp;t=128|title=Eleanor Knox (KCL) - The Curious Case of the Vanishing  Spacetime|first=|last=BristolPhilosophy|date=19 February 2013|publisher=|accessdate=7 April 2018|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; the property that particles seem to not just be in one determinate position at one time, but are somewhere 'here', and also 'there' at the same time. Such a radical view turns a lot of our common sense metaphysical ideas on their head. Much of contemporary philosophy of quantum mechanics aims to make sense of what the very empirically successful formalism of quantum mechanics tells us about the physical world.

===The Everett Interpretation===
{{Main article|Many-worlds interpretation}}
The Everett, or many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics claims that the [[wave-function]] of a quantum system is telling us claims about the reality of that physical system. It denies [[wavefunction collapse]], and claims that [[superposition principle|superposition]] states should be interpreted literally as describing the reality of many-worlds where objects are located, and not simply indicating the indeterminacy of those variables. This is sometimes argued as a corollary of [[scientific realism]],&lt;ref&gt;David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', p.1-10&lt;/ref&gt; which states that scientific theories aim to give us literally true descriptions of the world.

One issue for the Everett interpretation is the role that probability plays on this account. The Everettian account is completely deterministic, whereas probability seems to play an ineliminable role in quantum mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', pg. 113-117&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary Everettians have argued that one can get an account of probability that follows the Born Rule through certain decision-theoretic proofs.&lt;ref&gt;David Wallace, 'The Emergent Multiverse', pg. 157-189&lt;/ref&gt;

Physicist Roland Omnés noted that it is impossible to experimentally differentiate between Everett's view, which says that as the wave-function decoheres into distinct worlds, each of which exists equally, and the more traditional view that says that a decoherent wave-function leaves only one unique real result. Hence, the dispute between the two views represents a great "chasm." "Every characteristic of reality has reappeared in its reconstruction by our theoretical model; every feature except one: the uniqueness of facts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Omnès|first1=Roland|title=Quantum philosophy : understanding and interpreting contemporary science|date=2002|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton|isbn=978-1400822867|page=213|edition=First paperback printing, 2002, translated by Arturo Spangalli.|language=French|chapter=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uncertainty principle===
{{Main article|Uncertainty principle}}
The [[uncertainty principle]] is a mathematical relation asserting an upper limit to the accuracy of the simultaneous measurement of any pair of [[conjugate variables]], e.g. position and momentum. In the formalism of [[Operator (physics)#Operators in quantum mechanics|operator notation]], this limit is the evaluation of the [[Canonical commutation relation|commutator]] of the variables' corresponding operators.

The uncertainty principle arose as an answer to the question: How does one measure the location of an electron around a nucleus if an electron is a wave?  When quantum mechanics was developed, it was seen to be a relation between the classical and quantum descriptions of a system using wave mechanics.

In March 1927, working in [[Niels Bohr]]'s institute, [[Werner Heisenberg]] formulated the principle of uncertainty thereby laying the foundation of what became known as the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of quantum mechanics. Heisenberg had been studying the papers of [[Paul Dirac]] and [[Pascual Jordan]].  He discovered a problem with measurement of basic variables in the equations. His analysis showed that uncertainties, or imprecisions, always turned up if one tried to measure the position and the momentum of a particle at the same time. Heisenberg concluded that these uncertainties or imprecisions in the measurements were not the fault of the experimenter, but fundamental in nature and are inherent mathematical properties of operators in quantum mechanics arising from definitions of these operators.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Bohr, ''Atomic Physics and Human Knowledge, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The term Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics was often used interchangeably with and as a synonym for Heisenberg's uncertainty principle by detractors (such as Einstein and the physicist [[Alfred Landé]]) who believed in [[determinism]] and saw the common features of the Bohr–Heisenberg theories as a threat. Within the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics the uncertainty principle was taken to mean that on an elementary level, the physical universe does not exist in a deterministic form, but rather as a collection of probabilities, or possible outcomes. For example, the pattern ([[probability distribution]]) produced by millions of photons passing through a diffraction slit can be calculated using quantum mechanics, but the exact path of each photon cannot be predicted by any known method. The Copenhagen interpretation holds that it cannot be predicted by any method, not even with theoretically infinitely precise measurements.

==History of the philosophy of physics==
===Aristotelian physics===
[[Aristotelian physics]] viewed the universe as a [[Sublunary sphere|sphere]] with a center. Matter, composed of the [[classical element#Greece|classical elements]], earth, water, air, and fire, sought to go down towards the center of the universe, the center of the earth, or up, away from it. Things in the [[Aether (classical element)|aether]] such as the moon, the sun, planets, or stars circled the center of the universe.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST3 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 3). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition."Because it is a sphere, Aristotle's universe contains a geometrically privileged center, and Aristotle makes reference to that center in characterizing the natural motions of different sorts of matter. “Upward,”“downward,” and “uniform circular motion” all are defined in terms of the center of the universe."&lt;/ref&gt; Movement is defined as change in place,&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST3 /&gt; i.e. space.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST4 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 4). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.  "Aristotle adopts the concept of space, and the correlative concept of motion, that we all intuitively employ."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newtonian physics===
The implicit axioms of Aristotelian physics with respect to movement of matter in space were superseded in [[Classical mechanics|Newtonian physics]] by [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's first law|First Law of Motion]].&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST3-4 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 4-5). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. "Newtonian physics is implicit in his First Law of Motion: Law I : Every body perseveres in its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by impressed forces. 1 This single law smashes the Aristotelian universe to smithereens."&lt;/ref&gt;{{cquote|Every body perseveres in its state either of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line, except insofar as it is compelled to change its state by impressed forces.}}
"Every body" includes the Moon, and an apple; and includes all types of matter, air as well as water, stones, or even a flame. Nothing has a natural or inherent motion.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST5&gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 5). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Absolute time and space|Absolute space]] being [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] [[Euclidean space]], infinite and without a center.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST5 /&gt; Being "at rest" means being at the same place in absolute space over time.&lt;ref name = MaudlinPPST9-10  &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (pp. 9-10). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. "Newton believed in the existence of a spatial arena with the geometrical structure of E{{smallsup|3}}. He believed that this infinite three-dimensional space exists at every moment of time. And he also believed something much more subtle and controversial, namely, that identically the same points of space persist through time."&lt;/ref&gt; The [[topology]] and [[Affine space|affine structure]] of space must permit movement in a [[Line (geometry)|straight line]] at a uniform velocity; thus both space and time must have [[Absolute time and space|definite, stable dimensions]].&lt;ref name = Maudlin12 &gt;[[Tim Maudlin]] (2012-07-22). ''Philosophy of Physics: Space and Time: Space and Time'' (Princeton Foundations of Contemporary Philosophy) (p. 12). Princeton University Press. Kindle Edition. "...space must have a topology, an affine structure, and a metric; time must be one-dimensional with a topology and a metric; and, most importantly, the individual parts of space must persist through time.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leibniz===
[[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], 1646 – 1716, was a contemporary of Newton. He contributed a fair amount to the statics and dynamics emerging around him, often disagreeing with [[Descartes]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]. He devised a new theory of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] ([[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]]) based on [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]], which posited space as relative, whereas Newton was thoroughly convinced that space was absolute. An important example of Leibniz's mature physical thinking is his ''Specimen Dynamicum'' of 1695.&lt;ref&gt;Ariew and Garber 117, Loemker §46, W II.5. On Leibniz and physics, see the chapter by Garber in Jolley (1995) and Wilson (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the discovery of subatomic particles and the [[quantum mechanics]] governing them, many of Leibniz's speculative ideas about aspects of nature not reducible to statics and dynamics made little sense. For instance, he anticipated [[Albert Einstein]] by arguing, against Newton, that [[space]], [[time]] and motion are relative, not absolute:&lt;ref name=Ferraro&gt;{{cite book |title =Einstein's Space-Time: An Introduction to Special and General Relativity|page= 1| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wa3CskhHaIgC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=time+%22absolute+space%22|author=Rafael Ferraro |isbn=978-0-387-69946-2 |publisher=Springer |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; "As for my own opinion, I have said more than once, that I hold space to be something merely relative, as time is, that I hold it to be an order of coexistences, as time is an order of successions."&lt;ref&gt;See H. G. Alexander, ed., ''The [[Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence]]'', Manchester: Manchester University Press, pp. 25–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quotes from Einstein's work on the importance of the philosophy of physics===
[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|left|Einstein was interested in the philosophical implications of his theory.]]
[[Albert Einstein]] was extremely interested in the philosophical conclusions of his work. He writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I fully agree with you about the significance and educational value of [[methodology]] as well as [[history of science|history]] and [[philosophy of science]]. So many people today—and even professional scientists—seem to me like somebody who has seen thousands of trees but has never seen a forest. A knowledge of the historic and philosophical background gives that kind of independence from [[prejudice]]s of his generation from which most scientists are suffering. This independence created by philosophical insight is—in my opinion—the mark of distinction between a mere artisan or specialist and a real seeker after truth." [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. letter to Robert A. Thornton, 7 December 1944. ''EA'' 61-574.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Elsewhere:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"How does it happen that a properly endowed [[natural sciences|natural scientist]] comes to concern himself with [[epistemology]]? Is there no more valuable work in his specialty? I hear many of my colleagues saying, and I sense it from many more, that they feel this way. I cannot share this sentiment. ... Concepts that have proven useful in ordering things easily achieve such an authority over us that we forget their earthly origins and accept them as unalterable givens. Thus they come to be stamped as 'necessities of thought,' 'a priori givens,' etc."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The path of scientific advance is often made impassable for a long time through such errors. For that reason, it is by no means an idle game if we become practiced in analyzing the long-commonplace concepts and exhibiting [revealing, exposing? -Ed.] those circumstances upon which their justification and usefulness depend, how they have grown up, individually, out of the givens of experience. By this means, their all-too-great authority will be broken." [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], 1916, "Memorial notice for [[Ernst Mach]]," ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' 17: 101-02.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Music eras}}
'''''Prehistoric music''''' (previously '''''primitive music''''') is a term in the [[history of music]] for all [[music]] produced in [[literate|preliterate]] cultures ([[prehistory]]), beginning somewhere in very late [[Geological history of the Earth|geological history]]. Prehistoric music is followed by [[ancient music]] in different parts of the world, but still exists in isolated areas. However, it is more common to refer to the "prehistoric" music which still survives as [[folk music|folk]], indigenous or traditional music. Prehistoric music is studied alongside other periods within [[music archaeology]]. 

Findings from [[Paleolithic]] archaeology sites suggest that prehistoric people used carving and piercing tools to create instruments. Archeologists have found [[Paleolithic flutes]] carved from bones in which lateral holes have been pierced. The [[Divje Babe flute]], carved from a [[cave bear]] [[femur]], is thought to be at least 40,000 years old. Instruments such as the seven-holed flute and various types of [[String instrument|stringed instruments]], such as the [[Ravanahatha]], have been recovered from the [[Indus Valley Civilization]] [[archaeology|archaeological]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN8170173329&amp;id=yySNDP9XVggC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=seven+holed+flute+and+various+types+of+stringed+instruments&amp;sig=0baqFLb6KItfPYLoCdFWFTCD8Sk ''The Music of India''] By Reginald MASSEY, Jamila MASSEY.

==Origins==
{{Tone|section|date=August 2013}}

Some cultures have certain instances of their [[Sound mimesis in various cultures|music intending to imitate natural sounds]]. In some instances, this feature is related to [[Imitation of sounds in shamanism|shamanistic beliefs or practice]].&lt;ref name=onom&gt;[http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf Hoppál 2006: 143] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402105719/http://dasa.baua.de/nn_35984/sid_2C8A99B3F31A58C62BBE3312986DC568/nsc_true/de/Presse/Pressematerialien/Sonderausstellung_20Macht_20Musik/Schamanen-Musik.pdf |date=2015-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt; It may also serve entertainment (game)&lt;ref name=natt&gt;Nattiez: 5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=desch&gt;[http://www.mustrad.org.uk/articles/inuit.htm Deschênes 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; or practical functions (for example, luring animals in hunt)&lt;ref name=natt/&gt;.

Another possible origin of music is [[motherese]], the vocal-gestural communication between mothers and infants. This form of communication involves melodic, rhythmic and movement patterns as well as the communication of intention and meaning, and in this sense is similar to music.&lt;ref&gt;Dissanayake, E. (2000). Antecedents of the temporal arts in early mother-infant interaction. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 389-410. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg 389-410&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller suggests musical displays play a role in "demonstrating fitness to mate". Based on the ideas of [[honest signal]] and the [[handicap principle]], Miller suggested that music and dancing, as energetically costly activities, were to demonstrate the physical and psychological fitness of the [[singing]] and [[dancing]] individual to the prospective mates.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, G. (2000). Evolution of human music through sexual selection. In The origins of music. Edited by Nils Wallin, Bjorn Merker and Steven Brown, pp. 329-360. Cambridge, MA: Massachusetts Institute of Technology, pg. 389-410&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prehistoric musical instruments==

It is likely that the first [[musical instrument]] was the [[human voice]] itself, which can make a vast array of sounds, from [[singing]], [[Hum (sound)|hum]]ming and [[whistling]] through to [[Click consonant|click]]ing, [[cough]]ing and [[yawn]]ing. (See Darwin’s ''[[Origin of Species]]'' on music and speech.) The oldest known [[Neanderthal]] [[hyoid]] bone with the modern human form has been dated to be 60,000 years old,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B. Arensburg |author2=A. M. Tillier |author3=B. Vandermeersch |author4=H. Duday |author5=L. A. Schepartz |author6=Y. Rak |date=April 1989 | title = A Middle Palaeolithic human hyoid bone | journal = Nature | issue = 6218| pages = 758–760 | doi = 10.1038/338758a0 | volume = 338 | pmid = 2716823}}&lt;/ref&gt; predating the oldest known [[Paleolithic flutes|Paleolithic bone flute]] by some 20,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/80beats/2009/06/24/worlds-oldest-flute-shows-first-europeans-were-a-musical-bunch/ http://blogs.discovermagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt; but the true chronology may date back much further.

Most likely the first rhythm instruments or [[percussion instruments]] involved the [[clapping]] of hands, stones hit together, or other things that are useful to create [[rhythm]] and there are examples of musical instruments which date back as far as the [[paleolithic]], although there is some ambiguity &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070705110132/http://www.dar.cam.ac.uk/dcrr/dcrr002.pdf |date=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; over archaeological finds which can be variously interpreted as either musical or non-musical instruments/tools. Examples of paleolithic objects which are considered unambiguously musical are bone flutes or pipes; paleolithic finds which are open to interpretation are pierced [[phalanges]] (usually interpreted as "phalangeal [[whistle]]s"), objects interpreted as [[Bullroarer (music)|bullroarers]], and [[rasp]]s.

Music can be theoretically traced to prior to the [[Paleolithic]] age, the [[anthropological]] and [[archaeological]] designation suggests that music first arose (among humans) when stone tools first began to be used by [[Hominidae|hominid]]s. The [[noise]]s produced by work such as pounding seed and roots into meal is a likely source of rhythm created by early humans.

In 2008, archaeologists discovered a bone flute in the [[Hohle Fels]] cave near [[Ulm]], [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wilford | first = John N. | title = Flutes Offer Clues to Stone-Age Music | journal = Nature| volume = 459| issue = 7244| pages = 248–52| publisher = The New York Times | location = | date = June 24, 2009 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/science/25flute.html |accessdate=June 29, 2009| doi = 10.1038/nature07995 | id = | pmid = 19444215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epoc.de/artikel/999323&amp;_z=798890&lt;/ref&gt; The five-holed flute has a V-shaped mouthpiece and is made from a vulture wing bone. The researchers involved in the discovery officially published their findings in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' in June 2009.

The oldest known wooden pipes were discovered in [[Wicklow]], [[Ireland]], in the winter of 2003. A wood-lined pit contained a group of six flutes made from yew wood, between 30 and 50&amp;nbsp;cm long, tapered at one end, but without any finger holes. They may once have been strapped together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://Flutopedia.com/dev_flutes_euroasia.htm#Wicklow_Pipes |title=The Wicklow Pipes / The Development of Flutes in Europe and Asia|author=Clint Goss |year=2012 |work=Flutopedia |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, several [[Gudi (instrument)|gudi]] (literally "bone flutes") were found in [[Jiahu]] in Henan Province, China. They date to about 6000 BCE. They have between 5 and 8 holes each and were made from the hollow bones of a bird, the [[red-crowned crane]]. At the time of the discovery, one was found to be still playable. The bone flute plays both the five- or seven-note scale of [[Xia Zhi]] and six-note scale of [[Qing Shang]] of the ancient [[Chinese musical system]].

==Archaeoacoustic methodology==
The use of the term 'music' is problematic within prehistory. It may be that, as in the traditional music of much of sub-Saharan Africa, the concept of 'music' as we understand it was somewhat different. Many languages traditionally have terms for music that include dance, religion or cult. The context in which prehistoric music took place has also become a subject of much study, as the sound made by music in prehistory would have been somewhat different depending on the acoustics present. The field of [[archaeoacoustics]] uses acoustic techniques to explore prehistoric sounds, soundscapes and instruments, and has included the study of ringing rocks and lithophones, of the acoustics of ritual sites such as chamber tombs and stone circles, and the exploration of prehistoric instruments using acoustic testing. Such work has included acoustic field tests to capture and analyse the impulse response of archaeological sites; acoustic tests of lithophones or 'rock gongs'; and reconstructions of soundscapes as experimental archaeology.

An academic research network, the [http://ambpnetwork.wordpress.com/ Acoustics and Music of British Prehistory Research Network], has explored this field.

==Cycladic culture==

[[File:Cycladic idol 03 2 retouched.jpg|thumb|Cycladic statues of a double flute player (foreground) and a harpist (background)]]
{{Further|Music of ancient Greece|Cycladic culture}}
On the island of [[Keros]] (Κέρος), two marble statues from the late [[Neolithic]] culture called [[Early Cycladic culture]] (2900-2000 BCE) were discovered together in a single grave in the 19th century. They depict a standing [[aulos|double flute]] player and a sitting musician playing a triangular-shaped [[lyre]] or [[harp]]. The harpist is approximately {{convert|23|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} high and dates to around 2700-2500 BCE. He expresses concentration and intense feelings and tilts his head up to the light. The meaning of these and many other figures is not known; perhaps they were used to ward off evil spirits or had religious significance or served as toys or depicted figures from [[mythology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9980">An individual's or community's '''religious orientation''' involves [[presumption]]s about the existence and nature of God or gods, religious prescriptions about morality and communal and personal spirituality. Such presumptions involve the study of psychology, ethics, sociology and anthropology.

==Psychology==

According to Whitley and Kite, researchers who were interested in studying the psychological effects of religion on prejudice initially studied the relationship between simple indicators of religiosity such as whether or not a person went to church and the level of prejudice that that person showed. Surprisingly these researchers found that "religious involvement was consistently correlated with a variety of forms of prejudice." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;Whitley, B.E. &amp; Kite, M.E. (2010). The psychology of prejudice and discrimination. Belmont, CA. 	Wadsworth.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally these findings were not well received by religious leaders or the religious community in general. It was at this point that there was a clear shift in the nature of the research. Instead of being concerned with factors such as church attendance and the quantity of religious involvement, researchers were now interested in the quality of religious involvement. As Whitley and Kite said, "These ideas evolved into the concepts of intrinsic and extrinsic religious orientation." (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010) &lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring==

[[Gordon Allport|Allport]] &amp; Ross developed a means of measuring  religious orientation. The Extrinsic measures extrinsic religious orientation (1967).&lt;ref&gt;Allport, G. W., &amp; Ross, J. M. (1967). Personal religious orientation and prejudice. Journal of 	Personality and Social Psychology, 5, 432-443.&lt;/ref&gt; A sample statement from this scale would be “The church is most important as a place to formulate good social relationships” (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010). This scale brought forth a lot of interest in religious orientations and much research has been done over the years. But as more researchers began studying religious orientation, the more problems that arose with the Intrinsic and Extrinsic scales measuring what they were supposed to be measuring (Hunsberger &amp; Jacson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;Hunsberger, B., &amp; Jackson, L. M. (2005). Religion, Meaning, and Prejudice. Journal of Social Issues, 	61(4), 807-826.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extrinsic==

Extrinsic Religious Orientation is a method of using religion to achieve non-religious goals, essentially viewing religion as a means to an end.&lt;ref name=batson&gt;{{cite book|last=Batson|first=Daniel|title=Religion and the Individual|year=1982|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=0-19-506208-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used by people who go to religious gatherings and claim certain religious ideologies to establish or maintain social networks while minimally adhering to the teachings of the religion. People high in external religious orientation are more likely to conform to social norms and demands rather than what the religion requires, and are often prone to twist religious beliefs to serve their own political goals. Gordon Allport stated that people high in external religious orientation use religion, “to provide security and solace, sociability and distraction, status and self-justification” (Allport &amp;Ross, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;434). (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010)&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prejudice===

Hunsberger &amp; Jackson did a review of studies on religious orientation that had taken place since 1990 (2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Links have been made between prejudice and religious orientation but there have been no agreement on the relationship with intolerance. This is because there are many targets of prejudice, such as race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and age. Hunsberger and Jackson have found support for the idea that the target of prejudice is important when looking at prejudice and religious orientation relationships. After careful analysis, they have found that extrinsic orientation is positively related to racial/ethnic and gay/lesbian intolerance. People who measure high in extrinsic religious orientation have a utilitarian approach and view religion as a meaningful source of social status. Having high extrinsic religious orientation means you conform to popular trends, such trends including prejudice. The validity of the religious orientation scales have proved debatable, thus relationships to prejudice have either supported or refuted Allport and Ross's theories (Hunsberger &amp; Jackson, 2005).&lt;ref name=hunsberger&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a politician who goes to church in order to gain votes.

==Intrinsic==

According to Whitley and Kite, a person with an Intrinsic Religious Orientation sincerely believes in their religion and all its teachings and attempt to live their lives as their religion preaches that they should (Whitley &amp; Kite, 2010).&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This agrees with what Daniel Batson would say; that while a person with an extrinsic religious orientation sees religion as a means to an end, a person with an intrinsic orientation sees their religion as that end. To them their religion is, "An active directing force, not just a tool used to reach self-serving ends." &lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Those with this orientation find their religion to be the most important aspect of their life and seek to contextualize other aspects of their life through their religion. 

===Prejudice===

Research has found that people who hold an intrinsic religious orientation sincerely believe in and follow the teachings of their religion. They live their religion, and as a result those, "with a strong internal orientation should be unprejudiced to the extent that their religions teach inter group tolerance." Studies have found that these people show either no correlation or a negative correlation for racial prejudice. On the other hand, these same people often show a positive correlation for prejudice against gays.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This effect would be predicted, being that while most religions do not speak ill of other races (racism being due to upbringing rather than any Biblical foundation), they do tend to have little regard for homosexuals. {{Citation needed|reason=show evidence the Bible is not racist or tribalist|date=December 2017}}

While this research appears more favorable than the research that showed a correlation between religious activity and prejudice, some researchers are convinced that these people are merely showing what they believe to be a more socially acceptable bias.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Batson tested this hypothesis by having participants in a study (a study the participants were led to believe was about watching and evaluating a movie) choose whether to sit in a theater with a white confederate, or a black one. There were two conditions in this study, an overt condition in which both theaters were showing the same movie and a covert condition in which each theater was showing a different movie. The researchers believed that a prejudiced person who was attempting to appear unprejudiced would sit with the black confederate when the movie selection was the same in order to appear unprejudiced, but would sit with the white confederate (participants were white) when their choice could be attributed to wanting to watch the different movie. The researchers found that 75% of intrinsically religious participants chose to sit with the black confederate in the overt condition, but only 46% choose to sit with the black confederate in the covert condition. While these results do show that intrinsically motivated people do want to appear racially unbiased, it also shows that they are not racially prejudiced in general. Contrary to the religious orientations theory, extrinsic religiosity was unrelated to prejudice in either condition.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

An example would be a person who truly believes in their religion and uses this belief to guide them in all other aspects of their life.

==Quest orientation==

A third religious orientation proposed by Batson is the quest orientation. People with this orientation treats their religion not as a means or an end, but a search for truth. As Batson said, "An individual who approaches religion in this way recognizes that he or she does not know, and probably never will know, the final truth about such matters. Still the questions are deemed important, and however tentative and subject to changes, answers are sought."&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Prejudice===

Intuitively, it is logical to assume that people who hold a quest orientation would be low in prejudice because by having this orientation they have already shown that they are open-minded and willing to change. This idea was tested alongside the intrinsic and extrinsic orientations by Batson in his theater experiment (described above in the "Intrinsic Religious Orientation and Prejudice" section). People who scored high in quest orientation choose to sit with the black confederate about half the time in both the overt and covert conditions, indicating both a lack of prejudice and a lack of the attempt to appear unprejudiced. To summarize Whitley and Kite as well as Batson, quest orientation appears to be the source of "universal love and compassion" that has long been sought by both religious scholars and researchers interested in the psychology of religion.&lt;ref name=kite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===

Examples of people who have attained a quest orientation are [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Malcolm X]], and [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]].&lt;ref name=batson&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Geistliche Schatzkammer Wienb.jpg|thumb|Ecclesiastical treasury in Vienna's [[Hofburg Palace]]]]
[[File:Juwelenzimmer 2 Grünes Gewölbe.jpg|thumb|The [[Green Vault]] in [[Dresden Castle]] (as at 1904)]]
'''''Schatzkammer''''', a German word which means ''treasury'' or ''treasure chamber'', is a term used in English for the collection of treasures, especially [[objet d'art]] in precious metals and jewels, of a ruler or other collector which are kept in a secure room and often found in the basement of a palace or castle. It also often included the wider types of object typical of the Renaissance [[cabinet of curiosities]].  A very small but evocative Renaissance room in a tower at [[Lacock Abbey]] was designed for keeping and viewing the treasures of the newly rich owner.

The term is normally used of the collections of European rulers or very wealthy families. Well-known examples are:

* The [[Imperial Treasury, Vienna|Imperial Treasury]] at the [[Hofburg Palace]] in Vienna, Austria.
* The collection of the royal regalia and treasures of the [[Bavaria]]n [[Wittelsbach]] dynasty, housed in the ''[[Residenz, Munich|Residenz]]'' Palace in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].
* The vast collection of the [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] [[Monarch]]s of [[Saxony]], kept in the ''[[Grünes Gewölbe]]'' at [[Dresden Castle]] in [[Dresden]], Germany.
* The [[Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom]] in the [[Tower of London]].
* A display of Bourbon treasures in the basement of the [[Museo del Prado]], Madrid.
* The [[Waddesdon Bequest]], a 19th-century collection of mostly Renaissance treasures now displayed together in the [[British Museum]].
* [[Rosenborg Castle]] in [[Copenhagen]] displays [[objet de vertu]] in silver, ivory and other precious materials, some in the cabinets and treasure rooms (porcelain room, glass room) specially constructed over the centuries by the [[Danish Royal Family|Kings of Denmark]] for their display.  The [[Crown Jewels]] and the [[Danish Crown Regalia]] are displayed in a series of modern galleries built inside an enormous vault in the basement. 

Church establishments also had treasuries where similar objects were kept, which are often now open as museums. Especially important and largely intact examples are:

* The [[Treasury of St. Vitus Cathedral]] in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]
* The [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]] at the [[Aachen Cathedral]] (Germany), one of the most important collections of church cultural artefacts in Europe
* The treasury of [[San Marco]], [[Venice]], which retains a unique collection of [[Byzantine art]], looted during the [[Fourth Crusade]]

Examples outside Europe include:
* The Treasure Rooms of [[Topkapi Palace]] display Ottoman treasures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6176">'''Soil ecology''' is the study of the interactions among [[soil biology]], and between biotic and abiotic aspects of the [[soil]] environment.&lt;ref&gt;Access Science: [http://www.accessscience.com/Encyclopedia/6/63/Est_631825_frameset.html?doi Soil Ecology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312193834/http://www.accessscience.com/Encyclopedia/6/63/Est_631825_frameset.html?doi |date=2007-03-12 }}.  Url last accessed 2006-04-06&lt;/ref&gt; It is particularly concerned with the [[biogeochemistry|cycling of nutrients]], formation and stabilization of the [[porosity|pore structure]], the spread and vitality of [[pathogen]]s, and the [[biodiversity]] of this rich [[soil life|biological community]].

== Overview ==
[[Soil]] is made up of a multitude of [[soil physics|physical]], [[soil chemistry|chemical]], and [[soil biology|biological]] entities, with many interactions occurring among them.  Soil is a variable mixture of broken and weathered minerals and decaying organic matter.  Together with the proper amounts of air and water, it supplies, in part, sustenance for plants as well as mechanical support.

The diversity and abundance of [[soil life]] exceeds that of any other [[ecosystem]].  Plant establishment, competitiveness, and growth is governed largely by the ecology below-ground, so understanding this system is an essential component of plant sciences and terrestrial ecology.

==Features of the ecosystem==
*[[Moisture]] is a major limiting factor on land. Terrestrial organisms are constantly confronted with the problem of [[dehydration]]. Transpiration or [[evaporation]] of water from plant surfaces is an energy dissipating process unique to the terrestrial environment.
*Temperature variations and extremes are more pronounced in the air than in the water medium.
*On the other hand, the rapid circulation of air throughout the globe results in a ready mixing and remarkably constant content of oxygen and carbon dioxide.
*Although soil offers solid support, air does not. Storing skeletons have been evolved in both land plants and animals and also special means of locomotion have been evolved in the latter.
*Land, unlike the ocean, is not continuous; there are important geographical barriers to free movement.
*The nature of the substrate, although important in water is especially vital in terrestrial environment. Soil, not air, is the source of highly variable nutrients; it is a highly developed ecological subsystem.

== Soil food web ==
{{main|soil food web}}

An incredible diversity of organisms make up the soil [[food web]]. They range in size from the tiniest one-celled [[bacteria]], [[algae]], [[fungi]], and [[protozoa]], to the more complex [[nematode]]s and micro-[[arthropod]]s, to the visible [[earthworm]]s, [[insect]]s, small [[vertebrate]]s, and [[plant]]s.  As these organisms eat, grow, and move through the soil, they make it possible to have clean water, clean air, healthy plants, and moderated water flow.

There are many ways that the soil food web is an integral part of landscape processes. [[Soil life|Soil organisms]] decompose organic compounds, including [[manure]], plant residues, and [[pesticide]]s, preventing them from entering water and becoming pollutants.  They sequester nitrogen and other nutrients that might otherwise enter groundwater, and they fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, making it available to plants.  Many organisms enhance soil aggregation and [[porosity]], thus increasing [[Infiltration (hydrology)|infiltration]] and reducing [[surface runoff]].  Soil organisms prey on crop pests and are food for above-ground animals.

== Research ==
Research  interests span many aspects of soil ecology and [[microbiology]], Fundamentally, researchers are interested in understanding the interplay among [[microorganisms]], [[fauna]], and plants, the [[biogeochemical]] processes they carry out, and the physical environment in which their activities take place, and  applying this knowledge to address environmental problems.

Example research projects are to examine the [[biogeochemistry]] and microbial ecology of [[septic drain field]] soils used to treat domestic [[wastewater]], the role of [[anecic]] [[earthworm]]s in controlling the movement of water and [[nitrogen cycle]] in [[agricultural soil science|agricultural soils]], and the assessment of soil quality in turf production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uri.edu/cels/nrs/seml/ Laboratory of Soil Ecology and Microbiology]. Url last accessed 2006-04-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Of  particular interest {{As of|2006|lc=on}} is to understand the roles and functions of [[arbuscular mycorrhiza|arbuscular]] [[mycorrhizal fungi]] in natural ecosystems.  The effect of [[Terra preta|anthropic soil conditions]] on arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, and the production of [[glomalin]] by arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi are both of particular interest due to their roles  in [[Carbon sequestration|sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide]].

'''Sustainable redevelopment''' is the [[doctrine]] within which a state, organization, or individual can work to recreate a [[Socio-economic status|socio-economic position]] attained prior to a deconstructive event while upholding sustainable and environmental practices. The doctrine is based on [[economics]] within [[environmentalism]]. Typically, by providing more upfront capital, one can create a system that is less energy intensive, less wasteful, and generally less expensive to maintain in the long run.&lt;ref name="DFD"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/esa/dsd/dsd/dsd_index.shtml |title=Division for Sustainable Development :: About |author=[[United Nations]] |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By redeveloping sustainably, long term [[energy conservation|energy efficiencies]] can be realized, coupled with highly reduced [[greenhouse gas emissions]].

Within the ideals of [[nation-building]], sustainable redevelopment can take up a greater significance. Post-[[disaster]] countries are in a unique situation to deal with these systems of ideals. Within this context, the idea behind initiating post-trauma sustainable redevelopment is that the underlying [[infrastructure]] is destroyed or damaged, therefore the situation is ideal for realizing the opportunities inherent to the situation.

==Background==
[[Sustainable development]] and [[redevelopment]] are closely linked, and several organizations have been implicitly involved with sustainable development. This type of development, in contrast to redevelopment, is not different other than the application to a specified problem. Sustainable development, is a form of development that coexists with existing forms of development.

While the systems for recreation on a small/local level are not universally widespread, there are several institutions which engage in sustainable development, that can theoretically be carried over to redevelopment. The [[Kyoto Protocol]]'s 12th Article&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol/mechanisms/clean_development_mechanism/items/2718.php |title=Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)  |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  speaks to "flexible mechanisms". These mechanisms allow countries which have ratified the Kyoto Protocol to lower their overall emissions through the most economical means, respective, of course, to that country. Theoretically, these mechanisms could be directed towards post-traumatic redevelopment.

==UN==
The United Nations Division for Sustainable Development "provides [[leadership]] and is an authoritative source of expertise within the United Nations system on sustainable development".&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt; The Division for Sustainable Development has been essential in the creation of such policies as [[Agenda 21]], and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation.&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

The [[United Nations]] declares that "Sustainable reconstruction management provides numerous environmental, safety and financial benefits."&lt;ref name="DFD"/&gt;

==World Bank==
The [[World Bank]] has been working on sustainable development projects through one of their internal groups, the Sustainable Development Network. These two groups work together to provide key sectors for sustainable development: "[[agriculture]] and [[rural development]], [[energy]], [[transport]], [[water]], [[Natural environment|environment]], [[urban development]], [[social development]], [[oil]], [[gas]], [[mining]], and [[chemical]]s, [[Information technology|information]] and [[Communication technology|communication]] technologies, and sub-national activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/TOPICS/EXTSDNET /0,,contentMDK:22113416~menuPK:64885073~pagePK:64885161~piPK:64884432~theSitePK:5929282,00.html |title=Sustainable Development - About Sustainable Development |author= |date= |work= |publisher= |accessdate=6 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Natural Hazards Research and Application Information Center of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] produced a work catalyzing the process for post-disaster sustainable redevelopment. In their book, “Holistic Disaster Recovery”, is spelled out the “Six Principles of [[Sustainability]]”

==The Six Principles of Sustainability==
1. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, its residents [[quality of life]].
2. Enhance local economic vitality.
3. Ensure social and intergenerational equity.
4. Maintain and, if possible, enhance, environmental quality.
5. Incorporate disaster resilience and [[Disaster mitigation|mitigation]].
6. Use a consensus-building, participatory process when making

''For the 2001 Doctor Who audio story, see [[The Stones of Venice (audio drama)]]''

'''''The Stones of Venice''''' is a three-volume treatise on [[Venice|Venetian]] art and [[List of architectural monuments of Venice|architecture]] by English art historian [[John Ruskin]], first published from 1851 to 1853.

''The Stones of Venice'' examines Venetian architecture in detail, describing for example over eighty churches. He discusses architecture of Venice's [[Byzantine Architecture|Byzantine]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and [[Renaissance]] periods, and provides a general history of the city.

==Views on art and society==
As well as being an art historian, Ruskin was a social reformer. He set out to prove how Venetian architecture exemplified the principles he discussed in his earlier work, ''[[The Seven Lamps of Architecture]]''.&lt;ref&gt;His introduction to the second edition (1855) characterises ''The Seven Lamps of Architecture'' not as a "complete exponent" of his matured views but "rather as an introduction to the more considered and careful statements of those views given in ''The Stones of Venice'', and in my Lectures&lt;!--Lectures in original--&gt; delivered at Edinburgh."&lt;/ref&gt;In the chapter "The Nature of Gothic" (from volume 2), Ruskin gives his views on how society should be organised.
&lt;blockquote&gt;We want one man to be always thinking, and another to be always working, and we call one a gentleman, and the other an operative; whereas the workman ought often to be thinking, and the thinker often to be working, and both should be gentlemen, in the best sense. As it is, we make both ungentle, the one envying, the other despising, his brother; and the mass of society is made up of morbid thinkers and miserable workers. Now it is only by labour that thought can be made healthy, and only by thought that labour can be made happy, and the two cannot be separated with impunity.&lt;ref&gt;Cook and Wedderburn 10.201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Research and publication==
Ruskin had visited Venice before, but he made two visits to Venice with his wife Effie specially to research the book. The first visit was in the winter of 1849-50. The first volume of ''The Stones of Venice'' appeared in 1851 and Ruskin spent another winter in Venice researching the next two volumes. His research methods included sketching and photography (by 1849 he had acquired his own camera so that he could take [[daguerrotypes]]).&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1514218/Mystery-photographs-part-of-Ruskin-collection.html |title=Mystery photographs part of Ruskin collection |last=Reynolds, Nigel |date=2006 |website=Daily Telegraph |access-date=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
It aroused considerable interest in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Britain and beyond. The chapter "The Nature of Gothic" was admired by [[William Morris]], who published it separately in an edition which is in itself an example of [[Gothic revival]]. Morris stated that it was "one of the very few necessary and inevitable utterances of the century".

The book inspired [[Marcel Proust]] (the narrator of the [[In search of lost time|Recherche]] visits Venice with his mother in a state of enthusiasm for Ruskin) and in 2010 [[Roger Scruton]] wrote that the book was, "the greatest description in English of a place made sacred by buildings".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spectator.org/archives/2010/11/05/the-wilderness-obsession|first=Roger|last=Scruton|title=The Wilderness Obsession|publisher=spectator.org|date=November 2010|accessdate=2012-08-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120529214626/http://spectator.org/archives/2010/11/05/the-wilderness-obsession|archivedate=2012-05-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a leading member of the [[Frankfurt School]] of critical theory, whose work has come to be associated with thinkers such as [[Ernst Bloch]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]], for whom the works of [[Freud]], [[Marx]], and [[Hegel]] were essential to a critique of modern society. He is widely regarded as one of the 20th century's foremost thinkers on aesthetics and philosophy, as well as one of its preeminent essayists. As a critic of both fascism and what he called the [[culture industry]], his writings—such as ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]'' (1947), ''[[Minima Moralia]]'' (1951) and ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966)—strongly influenced the European [[New Left]].

Amidst the vogue enjoyed by [[existentialism]] and [[positivism]] in early 20th-century Europe, Adorno advanced a dialectical conception of natural history that critiqued the twin temptations of [[ontology]] and [[empiricism]] through studies of [[Kierkegaard]] and [[Husserl]]. As a classically trained pianist whose sympathies with the twelve-tone technique of [[Arnold Schoenberg]] resulted in his studying composition with [[Alban Berg]] of the [[Second Viennese School]], Adorno's commitment to avant-garde music formed the backdrop of his subsequent writings and led to his collaboration with [[Thomas Mann]] on the latter's novel ''[[Doctor Faustus (Thomas Mann novel)|Doctor Faustus]]'', while the two men lived in California as exiles during the [[World War II|Second World War]]. Working for the newly relocated [[Institute for Social Research]], Adorno collaborated on influential studies of [[authoritarianism]], [[antisemitism]] and [[propaganda]] that would later serve as models for sociological studies the Institute carried out in post-war Germany.

Upon his return to Frankfurt, Adorno was involved with the reconstitution of German intellectual life through debates with [[Karl Popper]] on the limitations of positivist science, critiques of [[Heidegger]]'s language of authenticity, writings on German responsibility for [[the Holocaust]], and continued interventions into matters of public policy. As a writer of polemics in the tradition of [[Nietzsche]] and [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]], Adorno delivered scathing critiques of contemporary Western culture. Adorno's posthumously published ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'', which he planned to dedicate to [[Samuel Beckett]], is the culmination of a lifelong commitment to modern art which attempts to revoke the "fatal separation" of feeling and understanding long demanded by the history of philosophy and explode the privilege aesthetics accords to content over form and contemplation over immersion.

==Life and career==

===Early years: Frankfurt===
Theodor W. Adorno (alias: Theodor Adorno-Wiesengrund) was born as Theodor Ludwig Wiesengrund in [[Frankfurt am Main]] on September 11, 1903, the only child of Oscar Alexander Wiesengrund (1870–1946) and Maria Calvelli-Adorno della Piana (1865–1952). His mother, a devout [[Catholic]] from [[Corsica]], was once a professional singer, while his father, an [[assimilated Jew]] who had [[Conversion to Christianity|converted]] to [[Protestantism]], ran a successful wine-export business. Proud of her origins, Maria wanted her son's paternal surname to be supplemented by the addition of her own name: Adorno. Thus his earliest publications carried the name Theodor Wiesengrund-Adorno; upon his application for [[US citizenship]], his name was modified to Theodor W. Adorno.

His childhood was marked by the musical life provided by his mother and aunt: Maria was a singer who could boast of having performed in Vienna at the Imperial Court, while her sister, Agathe, who lived with them, had made a name for herself as both a singer and pianist. He was not only a precocious child but, as he recalled later in life, a child prodigy who could play pieces by [[Beethoven]] on the piano by the time he was twelve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of six, he attended the Deutschherren middle school before transferring to the Kaiser-Wilhelm [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]], where he studied from 1913 to 1921. Prior to his graduation at the top of his class, Adorno was already swept up by the revolutionary mood of the time, as is evidenced by his reading of [[Georg Lukács]]'s ''The Theory of the Novel'' that year, as well as by his fascination with [[Ernst Bloch]]'s ''The Spirit of Utopia'', of which he would later write:
{{quote|Bloch's was a philosophy that could hold its head high before the most advanced literature; a philosophy that was not calibrated to the abominable resignation of methodology ... I took this motif so much as my own that I do not believe I have ever written anything without reference to it, either implicit or explicit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=212}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Yet Adorno's intellectual nonconformism was no less shaped by the repugnance he felt towards the nationalism which swept through the Reich during the [[World War I|First World War]]. Along with future collaborators like [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Max Horkheimer]], and Ernst Bloch, Adorno was profoundly disillusioned by the ease with which Germany's intellectual and spiritual leaders—among them [[Max Weber]], [[Max Scheler]], [[Georg Simmel]], as well as his friend [[Siegfried Kracauer]]—came out in support of the war. The younger generation's distrust for traditional knowledge arose from the way in which this tradition had discredited itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=66–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over time, Oscar Wiesengrund's firm established close professional and personal ties with the factory of Karplus &amp; Herzberger in Berlin. The eldest daughter of the Karplus family, Margarete, or Gretel, moved in the intellectual circles of Berlin, where she was acquainted with Walter Benjamin, [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Ernst Bloch, each of whom Adorno would become familiar with during the mid-1920s; after fourteen years, Gretel and Theodor were married in 1937.

At the end of his schooldays, Adorno not only benefited from the rich concert offerings of Frankfurt—where one could hear performances of works by Schoenberg, [[Schreker]], [[Stravinsky]], [[Bartók]], [[Busoni]], [[Frederick Delius|Delius]] and [[Hindemith]]—but also began studying music composition at the [[Hoch Conservatory]] while taking private lessons with well-respected composers [[Bernhard Sekles]] and Eduard Jung. At around the same time, he befriended Siegfried Kracauer, the ''[[Frankfurter Zeitung]]''{{'}}s literary editor, of whom he would later write:
{{quote|For years Kracauer read [Kant's] ''Critique of Pure Reason'' with me regularly on Saturday afternoons. I am not exaggerating in the slightest when I say that I owe more to this reading than to my academic teachers ... Under his guidance I experienced the work from the beginning not as mere epistemology, not as an analysis of the conditions of scientifically valid judgments, but as a kind of coded text from which the historical situation of spirit could be read, with the vague expectation that in doing so one could acquire something of truth itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|1992|page=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Leaving gymnasium to study philosophy, psychology and sociology at [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University]] in Frankfurt, Adorno continued his readings with Kracauer, turning now to [[Hegel]] and [[Kierkegaard]], and began publishing concert reviews and pieces of music for distinguished journals like the ''Zeitschrift für Musik'', the ''Neue Blätter für Kunst und Literatur'' and later for the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''. In these articles, Adorno championed avant-garde music at the same time as he critiqued the failings of musical modernity, as in the case of Stravinsky's ''[[Histoire du soldat|The Soldier's Tale]]'', which he called in 1923 a "dismal Bohemian prank."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In these early writings, he was unequivocal in his condemnation of performances which either sought or pretended to achieve a transcendence which Adorno, in line with many intellectuals of the time, regarded as impossible: "No cathedral," he wrote, "can be built if no community desires one."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In the summer of 1924, Adorno received his doctorate with a study of [[Edmund Husserl]] under the direction of the unorthodox neo-Kantian [[Hans Cornelius]].  Before his graduation, Adorno had already met with his most important intellectual collaborators, [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Walter Benjamin]]. Through Cornelius's seminars, Adorno met his future collaborator Max Horkheimer, through whom he was then introduced to [[Friedrich Pollock]].

===Vienna, Frankfurt, and Berlin===

During the summer of 1924, the Viennese composer [[Alban Berg]]'s "Three Fragments from [[Wozzeck]]", op. 7 premiered in Frankfurt, at which time Adorno introduced himself to Berg and both agreed the young philosopher and composer would study with Berg in Vienna. Upon moving to Vienna in February 1925, Adorno immersed himself in the musical culture which had grown up around Schoenberg: in addition to his twice-weekly sessions with Berg, Adorno continued his studies on piano with [[Eduard Steuermann]] and befriended the violinist [[Rudolf Kolisch]]. In Vienna, he attended public lectures of the satirist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]] with Berg and met [[Lukács]], who had been living in Vienna after the failure of the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]]. Alban Berg, the man Adorno referred to as "my master and teacher", was among the most prescient of his young pupil's early friends:

{{quote|[I am] convinced that, in the sphere of the deepest understanding of music ... you are capable of supreme achievements and will undoubtedly fulfill this promise in the shape of great philosophical works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
After leaving Vienna, Adorno traveled through Italy, where he met with Kracauer, Benjamin, and the economist [[Alfred Sohn-Rethel]], with whom he developed a lasting friendship, before returning to Frankfurt. In December 1926 Adorno's "Two Pieces for String Quartet", op. 2 were performed in Vienna, which provided a welcome interruption from his preparations for the [[Habilitation]]. After writing the "Piano Pieces in strict twelve-tone technique", as well as songs later integrated into the ''Six Bagatelles for Voice and Piano'', op. 6, Adorno presented his [[Habilitation]] manuscript, ''The Concept of the Unconscious in the Transcendental Theory of the Psyche'' (''Der Begriff des Unbewußten in der transzendentalen Seelenlehre''), to [[Hans Cornelius|Cornelius]] in November 1927. Cornelius advised Adorno to withdraw his application on the grounds that the manuscript was too close to his own way of thinking. In this manuscript, Adorno attempted to underline the epistemological status of the [[Unconsciousness|unconscious]] as it emerged from [[Freud]]'s early writings. Against the function of the unconscious in both [[Nietzsche]] and [[Spengler]], Adorno argued that Freud's notion of the unconscious serves as a "sharp weapon ... against every attempt to create a metaphysics of the instincts and to deify full, organic nature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=105}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Undaunted by his academic prospects, Adorno threw himself once again into composition. In addition to publishing numerous  reviews of opera performances and concerts, Adorno's "Four Songs for Medium Voice and Piano", op. 3 was performed in Berlin in January 1929. Between 1928 and 1930 Adorno took on a greater role within the editorial committee of the ''Musikblätter des Anbruch''. In a proposal for transforming the journal, Adorno sought to use ''Anbruch'' for championing radical modern music against what he called the "stabilized music" of [[Hans Pfitzner|Pfitzner]], the later [[Strauss]], as well as the [[neoclassicism]] of [[Stravinsky]] and [[Hindemith]]. During this period he published the essays "Night Music", "On Twelve-Tone Technique" and "Reaction and Progress". Yet his reservations about twelve-tone orthodoxy became steadily more pronounced: According to Adorno, [[twelve-tone technique]]'s use of [[atonality]] can no more be regarded as an authoritative canon than can [[tonality]] be relied on to provide instructions for the composer.

At this time, Adorno struck up a correspondence with the composer [[Ernst Krenek]], with whom he discussed problems of atonality and twelve-tone technique. In a letter of 1934 Adorno sounded a related criticism of Schoenberg:

{{quote|Twelve-tone technique alone is nothing but the principle of motivic elaboration and variation, as developed in the sonata, but elevated now to a comprehensive principle of construction, namely transformed into an ''a priori'' form and, by that token, detached from the surface of the composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
At this point Adorno reversed his earlier priorities: now his musical activities came second to the development of a philosophical theory of aesthetics. Thus, in the middle of 1929 he accepted [[Paul Tillich]]'s offer to present an Habilitation on [[Kierkegaard]], which Adorno eventually submitted under the title ''The Construction of the Aesthetic''. At the time, [[Kierkegaard]]'s philosophy exerted a strong influence, chiefly through its claim to pose an alternative to [[Idealism]] and [[Hegel]]'s philosophy of history. Yet when Adorno turned his attention to [[Kierkegaard]], watchwords like "anxiety," "inwardness" and "leap"—instructive for [[Existentialism|existentialist philosophy]]—were detached from their theological origins and posed, instead, as problems for aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the work proceeded—and [[Kierkegaard]]'s overcoming of [[Hegel]]'s idealism was revealed to be a mere interiorization—Adorno excitedly remarked in a letter to [[Alban Berg|Berg]] that he was writing without looking over his shoulder at the faculty who would soon evaluate his work. Receiving favourable reports from Professors Tillich and Horkheimer, as well as Benjamin and Kracauer, the University conferred on Adorno the ''[[venia legendi]]'' in February 1931; on the very day his revised study was published, 23 March 1933, [[Hitler]] seized dictatorial powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several months after qualifying as a lecturer in philosophy, Adorno delivered an inaugural lecture at the [[Institute for Social Research]], an independent organization which had recently appointed Horkheimer as its director and, with the arrival of the literary scholar [[Leo Lowenthal]], social psychologist [[Erich Fromm]] and philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]], sought to exploit recent theoretical and methodological advances in the social sciences. His lecture, "The Actuality of Philosophy," created a scandal. In it, Adorno not only deviated from the theoretical program Horkheimer had laid out a year earlier, but challenged philosophy's very capacity for comprehending reality as such: "For the mind," Adorno announced, "is indeed not capable of producing or grasping the totality of the real, but it may be possible to penetrate the detail, to explode in miniature the mass of merely existing reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; In line with [[Walter Benjamin|Benjamin]]'s ''[[The Origin of German Tragic Drama]]'' and preliminary sketches of the [[Arcades Project]], Adorno likened philosophical interpretation to experiments which should be conducted "until they arrive at figurations in which the answers are legible, while the questions themselves vanish." Having lost its position as the Queen of the Sciences, philosophy must now radically transform its approach to objects so that it might "construct keys before which reality springs open."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2000|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Horkheimer's taking up the directorship of the Institute, a new journal, ''Zeitschrift für Sozialforschung'', was produced to publish the research of Institute members both before and after its relocation to the United States. Though Adorno was not himself an Institute member, the journal nevertheless published many of his essays, including "The Social Situation of Music" (1932), "On Jazz" (1936), "On the Fetish-Character in Music and the Regression of Listening" (1938) and "Fragments on Wagner" (1938). In his new role as social theorist, Adorno's philosophical analysis of cultural phenomena heavily relied on the language of [[historical materialism]], as concepts like [[reification (Marxism)|reification]], [[false consciousness]] and [[ideology]] came to play an ever more prominent role in his work. At the same time, however, and owing to both the presence of another prominent sociologist at the Institute, [[Karl Mannheim]], as well as the methodological problem posed by treating objects—like "musical material"—as ciphers of social contradictions, Adorno was compelled to abandon any notion of "value-free" sociology in favour of a form of ideology critique which held on to an idea of truth. Before his emigration in autumn 1934, Adorno began work on a ''Singspiel'' based on [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[The Adventures of Tom Sawyer]]'' entitled ''The Treasure of Indian Joe'', which he would, however, never complete; by the time he fled [[Hitler]]'s Germany Adorno had already written over a hundred opera or concert reviews and an additional fifty critiques of music composition.

As the [[Nazi]] party became the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] Horkheimer's 1932 observation proved typical for his milieu: "Only one thing is certain", he wrote, "the irrationality of society has reached a point where only the gloomiest predictions have any plausibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September Adorno's right to teach was revoked; in March, as the [[swastika]] was run up the flag pole of town hall, the Institute's offices were searched by the Frankfurt criminal police. Adorno's house on Seeheimer Strasse was similarly searched in July and his application for membership in the Reich Chamber of Literature was denied on the grounds that membership was limited to "persons who belong to the German nation by profound ties of character and blood. As a non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]]," he was informed, "you are unable to feel and appreciate such an obligation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterwards Adorno was forced into fifteen years of exile.

===Exile: Oxford, New York, Los Angeles===

After the possibility of transferring his [[habilitation]] to the [[University of Vienna]] came to nothing, Adorno considered relocating to Britain upon his father's suggestion.  With the help of the [[Academic Assistance Council]], Adorno registered as an advanced student at [[Merton College]], Oxford, in June 1934. During the next four years at Oxford, Adorno made repeated trips to Germany to see both his parents and Gretel, who was still working in Berlin. Under the direction of [[Gilbert Ryle]], Adorno worked on a dialectical critique of [[Edmund Husserl|Husserl]]'s epistemology. By this time, the [[Institute for Social Research]] had relocated to New York City and began making overtures to Adorno. After months of strained relations, [[Max Horkheimer|Horkheimer]] and Adorno reestablished their essential theoretical alliance during meetings in Paris. Adorno continued writing on music, publishing "The Form of the Phonograph Record" and "Crisis of Music Criticism" with the Viennese musical journal ''23'', "On Jazz" in the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', "Farewell to Jazz" in ''Europäische Revue''. Yet Adorno's attempts to break out of the sociology of music were, at this time, twice thwarted: neither the study of Mannheim he had been working on for years nor extracts from his study of Husserl were accepted by the ''Zeitschrift''. Impressed by Horkheimer's book of aphorisms, ''Dawn and Decline'', Adorno began working on his own book of aphorisms, what would later become ''Minima Moralia''. While at Oxford, Adorno suffered two great losses: his Aunt Agathe died in June 1935, while Alban Berg died in December of the same year. To the end of his life, Adorno never abandoned the hope of completing [[Alban Berg|Berg]]'s unfinished [[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]].

At this time, Adorno was in intense correspondence with [[Walter Benjamin]] on the subject of the latter's ''[[Arcades Project]]''. After receiving an invitation from Horkheimer to visit the Institute in New York, Adorno sailed for New York on June 9, 1937 and stayed there for two weeks. While in New York, Max Horkheimer's essays "The Latest Attack on Metaphysics" and "Traditional and Critical Theory," which would soon become instructive for the Institute's self-understanding, were the subject of intense discussion. Soon after his return to Europe, Gretel moved to Britain, where she and Adorno were married on September 8, 1937; a little over a month later, Horkheimer telegrammed from New York with news of a position Adorno could take up with the [[Radio Project|Princeton Radio Project]], then under the directorship of the Austrian sociologist [[Paul Lazarsfeld]]. Yet Adorno's work continued with studies of [[Beethoven]] and [[Richard Wagner]] (published in 1939 as "Fragments on Wagner"), drafts of which he read to Benjamin during their final meeting, in December on the Italian Riviera. According to Benjamin, these drafts were astonishing for "the precision of their materialist deciphering," as well as the way in which "musical facts ... had been made socially transparent in a way that was completely new to me."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=237, 239}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his Wagner study, the thesis later to characterize ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''—man's domination of nature—first emerges. Adorno sailed for New York on February 16, 1938. Soon after settling into his new home on Riverside Drive, Adorno met with Lazarsfeld in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] to discuss the Project's plans for investigating the impact of broadcast music.

Although he was expected to embed the Project's research within a wider theoretical context, it soon became apparent that the Project was primarily concerned with [[data collection]] to be used by administrators for establishing whether groups of listeners could be targeted by broadcasts specifically aimed at them. Expected to make use of devices with which listeners could press a button to indicate whether they liked or disliked a particular piece of music, Adorno bristled with distaste and astonishment:  "I reflected that culture was simply the condition that precluded a mentality that tried to measure it."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=247}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus Adorno suggested using individual interviews to determine listener reactions and, only three months after meeting Lazarsfeld, completed a 160-page memorandum on the Project's topic, "Music in Radio." Adorno was primarily interested in how the musical material was affected by its distribution through the medium of radio and thought it imperative to understand how music was affected by its becoming part of daily life. "The meaning of a Beethoven symphony," he wrote, "heard while the listener is walking around or lying in bed is very likely to differ from its effect in a concert-hall where people sit as if they were in church."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=249}}&lt;/ref&gt; In essays published by the Institute's ''Zeitschrift'', Adorno dealt with that atrophy of musical culture which had become instrumental in accelerating tendencies—towards [[conformity|conformism]], trivialization and standardization—already present in the larger culture. Unsurprisingly, Adorno's studies found little resonance among members of the project. At the end of 1939, when Lazarsfeld submitted a second application for funding, the musical section of the study was duly left out. Yet during the two years during which he worked on the Project, Adorno was nevertheless prolific, publishing "The Radio Symphony", "A Social Critique of Radio Music", and "On Popular Music", texts which, along with the draft memorandum and other unpublished writings, are now found in Robert Hullot-Kentor's recent translation, ''Current of Music''. In light of this situation, Horkheimer soon found a permanent post for Adorno at the Institute.

In addition to helping with the ''Zeitschrift'', Adorno was expected to be the Institute's liaison with Benjamin, who soon passed on to New York the study of [[Charles Baudelaire]] he hoped would serve as a model of the larger ''Arcades Project''. In correspondence, the two men discussed the difference in their conceptions of the relationship between critique and artworks which had become manifest through Benjamin's "[[The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction|The Work of Art in the Age of its Technical Reproducibility]]". At around the same time Adorno and Horkheimer began planning for a joint work on "dialectical logic", which would later become ''Dialectic of Enlightenment''. Alarmed by reports from Europe, where Adorno's parents suffered increasing discrimination and Benjamin was interned in [[Colombes]], their joint study could entertain few delusions about its practical effects. "In view of what is now threatening to engulf Europe," Horkheimer wrote, "our present work is essentially destined to pass things down through the night that is approaching: a kind of message in a bottle."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Adorno continued his work in New York with radio talks on music and a lecture on Søren Kierkegaard's doctrine of love, Benjamin fled Paris and attempted to make an illegal border crossing. After learning that his Spanish visa was invalid and fearing deportation back to France, Benjamin took an overdose of morphine tablets. In light of recent events, the Institute set about formulating a theory of antisemitism and fascism. On one side were those who supported [[Franz Leopold Neumann|Franz Neumann]]'s thesis according to which [[National Socialism]] was a form of "[[monopoly capitalism|monopoly capital]]"; on the other were those who supported [[Friedrich Pollock]]'s "[[state capitalist]] theory." Horkheimer's contributions to this debate, in the form of the essays "The Authoritarian State", "The End of Reason", and "The Jews and Europe" served as a foundation for what he and Adorno planned to do in their book on dialectical logic.

In November 1941 Adorno followed Horkheimer to what [[Thomas Mann]] called "German California",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Claussen|2008|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting up house in a [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] neighborhood of German émigrés which included [[Bertolt Brecht]] and Arnold Schoenberg. Adorno arrived with  a draft of his ''Philosophy of New Music'', a dialectical critique of twelve-tone music, which Adorno himself felt, while writing, was already a departure from the theory of art he had spent the previous decades elaborating. Horkheimer's reaction to the manuscript was wholly positive: "If I have ever in the whole of my life felt enthusiasm about anything, then I did on this occasion," he wrote after reading the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two set about completing their joint work, which transformed itself from a book on dialectical logic to a rewriting of the history of rationality and the Enlightenment. First published in a small mimeographed edition in May 1944 as ''Philosophical Fragments'', the text would wait another three years before achieving book form when it was published with its definitive title, ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', by the Amsterdam publisher Querido Verlag. This "reflection on the destructive aspect of progress" proceeded through the chapters which treated rationality as both the liberation from and further domination of nature, interpretations of both [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the [[Marquis de Sade]], as well as analyses of the culture industry and antisemitism.

With their joint work completed, the two turned their attention to studies on antisemitism and authoritarianism in collaboration with the [[Nevitt Sanford]]-led Public Opinion Study Group and the [[American Jewish Committee]]. In line with these studies, Adorno produced an analysis of the Californian radio preacher Martin Luther Thomas. Fascist propaganda of this sort, Adorno wrote, "simply takes people for what they are: genuine children of today's standardized mass culture who have been robbed to a great extent of their autonomy and spontaneity"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of these labors, the 1950 study ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' was pioneering in its combination of quantitative and qualitative methods of collecting and evaluating data as well as its development of the [[F-scale (personality test)|F-scale]].

After the USA entered the war in 1941, the situation of the émigrés, now classed "[[enemy aliens]]", became increasingly restricted. Forbidden from leaving their homes between 8pm and 6am and prohibited from going more than five miles from their houses, émigrés like Adorno, who would not be naturalized until November 1943, were severely restricted in their movements.

In addition to the aphorisms which conclude ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'', Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as ''Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life''. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], treated issues like [[emigration]], [[totalitarianism]], and [[individuality]], as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and became friends with [[Fritz Lang]] and [[Hanns Eisler]], with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films. Additionally, Adorno assisted [[Thomas Mann]] on his novel ''[[Doktor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]'' after the latter asked for his help. "Would you be willing," Mann wrote, "to think through with me how the work—I mean Leverkühn's work—might look; how you would do it if you were in league with the Devil?"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of October 1949, Adorno left America for Europe just as ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' was being published. Before his return, Adorno had not only reached an agreement with a Tübingen publisher to print an expanded version of ''Philosophy of New Music'', but completed two compositions: ''Four Songs for Voice and Piano by Stefan George, op.7'', and ''Three Choruses for Female Voices from the Poems of Theodor Däubler, op. 8''.

===Post-war Europe===

====Return to Frankfurt University====
Upon his return, Adorno helped shape the political culture of West Germany. Until his death in 1969, twenty years after his return, Adorno contributed to the intellectual foundations of the Federal Republic, as a professor at [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt University]], critic of the vogue enjoyed by Heideggerian philosophy, partisan of critical sociology, and teacher of music at the [[Darmstadt International Summer Courses for New Music]]. Adorno resumed his teaching duties at the university soon after his arrival,{{when|date=September 2012}} with seminars on "Kant's Transcendental Dialectic", aesthetics, Hegel, "Contemporary Problems in the Theory of Knowledge", and "The Concept of Knowledge". Adorno's surprise at his students' passionate interest in intellectual matters did not, however, blind him to continuing problems within Germany: The literary climate was dominated by writers who had remained in Germany during Hitler's rule, the government re-employed people who had been active in the Nazi apparatus and people were generally loath to own up to their own collaboration or the guilt they thus incurred. Instead, the ruined city of Frankfurt continued as if nothing had happened,{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} holding on to ideas of the true, the beautiful, and the good despite the atrocities, hanging on to a culture that had itself been lost in rubble or killed off in the concentration camps. All the enthusiasm Adorno's students showed for intellectual matters could not erase the suspicion that, in the words of [[Max Frisch]], culture had become an "alibi" for the absence of political consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=332}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the foundations for what would come to be known as "The Frankfurt School" were soon laid: Horkheimer resumed his chair in social philosophy and the Institute for Social Research, rebuilt, became a lightning rod for critical thought.

====Essays on fascism====
Starting with his 1947 essay ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, TW (1947) ''Wagner, Nietzsche and Hitler'' in ''Kenyan Review'' Vol.ix (1)&lt;/ref&gt; Adorno produced a series of influential works to describe psychological fascist traits. One of these works was ''[[The Authoritarian Personality]]'' (1950),&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, [http://ada.evergreen.edu/~arunc/texts/frankfurt/ap/politics.pdf ''Politics and Economics in the Interview Material''], ch.17&lt;/ref&gt; published as a contribution to the ''Studies in Prejudice'' performed by multiple research institutes in the US, and consisting of a '[[qualitative research|qualitative interpretation]]s' that uncovered the [[authoritarianism|authoritarian]] character of test persons through indirect questions.{{citation needed|date=April 2010}} The books have had a major influence on sociology and remain highly discussed and debated. In 1951 he continued on the topic with his essay ''Freudian Theory and the Pattern of Fascist Propaganda'', in which he said that "Psychological dispositions do not actually cause fascism; rather, fascism defines a psychological area which can be successfully exploited by the forces which promote it for entirely non-psychological reasons of self-interest."&lt;ref&gt;Hammer, Espen (2006) [https://books.google.com/books?id=X3L5R3kiOh4C&amp;pg=PA56 ''Adorno and the political''], pp.56–7&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Adorno participated in a group experiment, revealing residual National Socialist attitudes among the recently democratized Germans. He then published two influential essays, ''The Meaning of Working Through the Past'' (1959), and ''Education after Auschwitz'' (1966), in which he argued on the survival of the uneradicated [[National Socialism]] in the [[mind-set]]s and institutions of the post-1945 Germany, and that there is still a real risk that it could rise again.&lt;ref&gt;Hammer (2006) p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, however, Jean Améry—who had been tortured at Auschwitz—would sharply object that Adorno, rather than addressing such political concerns, was exploiting Auschwitz for his metaphysical phantom "absolute negativity" ("absolute Negativität"), using a language intoxicated by itself ("von sich selber bis zur Selbstblendung entzückte Sprache").&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Dorschel, 'Der Geist ist stets gestört', in: ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'' nr. 129 (7 June 2004), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public events====
In September 1951 Adorno returned to the United States for a six-week visit, during which he attended the opening of the Hacker Psychiatry Foundation in Beverly Hills, met [[Leo Lowenthal]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]] in New York and saw his mother for the last time. After stopping in Paris, where he met [[Daniel-Henry Kahnweiler]], [[Michel Leiris]] and [[René Leibowitz]], Adorno delivered a lecture entitled "The Present State of Empirical Social Research in Germany" at a conference on opinion research. Here he emphasized the importance of data collection and statistical evaluation while asserting that such empirical methods have only an auxiliary function and must lead to the formation of theories which would "raise the harsh facts to the level of consciousness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Horkheimer as dean of the Arts Faculty, then rector of the university, responsibilities for the Institute's work fell upon Adorno. At the same time, however, Adorno renewed his musical work: with talks at the Kranichsteiner Musikgesellschaft, another in connection with a production of [[Ernst Krenek]]'s opera ''[[Leben des Orest]]'', and a seminar on "Criteria of New Music" at the Fifth International Summer Course for New Music at Kranichstein. Adorno also became increasingly involved with the publishing house of [[Peter Suhrkamp]], inducing the latter to publish Benjamin's ''Berlin Childhood Around 1900'', Kracauer's writings and a two-volume edition of Benjamin's writings. Adorno's own recently published ''Minima Moralia'' was not only well received in the press, but also met with great admiration from Thomas Mann, who wrote to Adorno from America in 1952:
{{quote|I have spent days attached to your book as if by a magnet. Every day brings new fascination ... concentrated nourishment. It is said that the companion star to Sirius, white in colour, is made of such dense material that a cubic inch of it would weigh a tonne here. This is why it has such an extremely powerful gravitational field; in this respect it is similar to your book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Yet Adorno was no less moved by other public events: protesting the publication of [[Heinrich Mann]]'s novel ''[[Professor Unrat]]'' with its film title, ''[[The Blue Angel]]''; declaring his sympathy with those who protested the scandal of big-game hunting and penning a defense of prostitutes.

====More essays on mass culture and literature====
Because Adorno's American citizenship would have been forfeited by the middle of 1952 had he continued to stay outside the country, he returned once again to [[Santa Monica]] to survey his prospects at the Hacker Foundation. While there he wrote a content analysis of [[Western astrology|newspaper horoscopes]] (now collected in ''The Stars Down to Earth''), and the essays "Television as Ideology" and "Prologue to Television"; even so, he was pleased when, at the end of ten months, he was enjoined to return as co-director of the Institute.

Back in Frankfurt, he renewed his academic duties and, from 1952 to 1954, completed three essays: "Notes on Kafka", "Valéry Proust Museum", and an essay on Schoenberg following the composer's death, all of which were included in the 1955 essay collection ''Prisms''. In response to the publication of [[Thomas Mann]]'s ''[[The Black Swan (Mann novella)|The Black Swan]]'', Adorno penned a long letter to the author, who then approved its publication in the literary journal ''Akzente''. A second collection of essays, ''Notes to Literature'', appeared in 1958. After meeting [[Samuel Beckett]] while delivering a series of lectures in Paris the same year, Adorno set to work on "Trying to Understand Endgame," which, along with studies of [[Proust]], [[Valéry]], and [[Balzac]], formed the central texts of the 1961 publication of the second volume of his ''Notes to Literature''. Adorno's entrance into literary discussions continued in his June 1963 lecture at the annual conference of the Hölderlin Society. At the Philosophers' Conference of October 1962 in Münster, at which Habermas wrote that Adorno was "A writer among bureaucrats", Adorno presented "Progress".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the ''Zeitschrift'' was never revived, the Institute nevertheless published a series of important sociological books, including ''Sociologica'' (1955), a collection of essays, ''Gruppenexperiment'' (1955), ''Betriebsklima'', a study of work satisfaction among workers in Mannesmann, and ''Soziologische Exkurse'', a textbook-like anthology intended as an introductory work about the discipline.

====Public figure====
Throughout the fifties and sixties, Adorno became a [[public figure]], not simply through his books and essays, but also through his appearances in radio and newspapers. In talks, interviews and round-table discussions broadcast on Hessen Radio, South-West Radio and Radio Bremen, Adorno discussed topics as diverse as "The Administered World" (September 1950), "What is the Meaning of 'Working Through the Past?"' (February 1960) to "The Teaching Profession and its Taboos" (August 1965). Additionally, he frequently wrote for ''Frankfurter Allgemeine'', ''Frankfurter Rundschau'' and the weekly ''Die Zeit''.

At the invitation of Wolfgang Steinecke, Adorno took part in the Darmstadt Summer Courses for New Music in Kranichstein from 1951 to 1958. Yet conflicts between the so-called [[Darmstadt school]], which included composers like [[Pierre Boulez]], [[Karlheinz Stockhausen]], [[Luigi Nono]], [[Bruno Maderna]], [[Karel Goeyvaerts]], [[Luciano Berio]] and [[Gottfried Michael Koenig]], soon arose, receiving explicit expression in Adorno's 1954 lecture, "The Aging of the New Music", where he argued that atonality's freedom was being restricted to serialism in much the same way as it was once restricted by twelve-tone technique. With his friend [[Eduard Steuermann]], Adorno feared that music was being sacrificed to stubborn rationalization. During this time Adorno not only produced a significant series of notes on Beethoven (which was never completed and only published posthumously), but also published ''Mahler: A Musical Physiognomy'' in 1960. In his 1961 return to Kranichstein, Adorno called for what he termed a "musique informelle", which would possess the ability "really and truly to be what it is, without the ideological pretense of being something else. Or rather, to admit frankly the fact of non-identity and to follow through its logic to the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-war German culture====
At the same time Adorno struck up relationships with contemporary German-language poets such as [[Paul Celan]] and [[Ingeborg Bachmann]]. Adorno's 1949 dictum—"To write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric"—posed the question of what German culture could mean after Auschwitz; his own continual revision of this dictum—in ''Negative Dialectics'', for example, he wrote that "Perennial suffering has as much right to expression as a tortured man has to scream";  while in "Commitment," he wrote in 1962 that the dictum "expresses in negative form the impulse which inspires committed literature"—was part of post-war Germany's struggle with history and culture. Adorno additionally befriended the writer and poet [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] as well as the film-maker [[Alexander Kluge]].

In 1963, Adorno was elected to the post of chairman of the German Sociological Society, where he presided over two important conferences: in 1964, on "Max Weber and Sociology" and in 1968 on "Late Capitalism or Industrial Society". A debate launched in 1961 by Adorno and [[Karl Popper]], later published as the ''[[Positivist Dispute in German Sociology]]'', arose out of disagreements at the 1959 14th German Sociology Conference in Berlin.

Adorno's critique of the dominant climate of post-war Germany was also directed against the pathos that had grown up around Heideggerianism, as practiced by writers like [[Karl Jaspers]] and [[Otto Friedrich Bollnow]], and which had subsequently seeped into public discourse. His 1964 publication of ''The Jargon of Authenticity'' took aim at the halo such writers had attached to words like "angst", "decision" and "leap". After seven years of work, Adorno completed ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' in 1966, after which, during the summer semester of 1967 and the winter semester of 1967–68, he offered regular philosophy seminars to discuss the book chapter by chapter. Among the students at these seminars were the Americans [[Angela Davis]] and Irving Wohlfarth. One objection which would soon take on ever greater importance, was that critical thought must adopt the standpoint of the oppressed, to which Adorno replied that negative dialectics was concerned "with the dissolution of standpoint thinking itself."

====Confrontations with students====
At the time of ''Negative Dialectics''{{'}} publication, the fragility of West German democracy led to increasing [[student protest]]s. Monopolistic trends in the media, an educational crisis in the universities, the Shah of Iran's 1967 state visit, German support for the war in Vietnam and the emergency laws combined to create a highly unstable situation. Like many of his students, Adorno too opposed the [[German Emergency Acts|emergency laws]], as well as the war in Vietnam, which, he said, proved the continued existence of the "world of torture that had begun in Auschwitz".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=451}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation only deteriorated with the police shooting of [[Benno Ohnesorg]] at a protest against the Shah's visit. This death, as well as the subsequent acquittal of the responsible officer, were both commented upon in Adorno's lectures. As politicization increased, rifts developed within both the Institute's relationship with its students as well as within the Institute itself. Soon Adorno himself would become an object of the students' ire. At the invitation of [[Peter Szondi]], Adorno was invited to the [[Free University of Berlin]] to give a lecture on [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Iphigenia in Tauris (Goethe)|Iphigenie in Tauris]]''. After a group of students marched to the lectern, unfurling a banner that read "Berlin's left-wing fascists greet Teddy the Classicist," a number of those present left the lecture in protest after Adorno refused to abandon his talk in favour of discussing his attitude on the current political situation. Adorno shortly thereafter participated in a meeting with the Berlin [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund]] (SDS) and discussed "Student Unrest" with Szondi on West German Radio. But as 1968 progressed, Adorno became increasingly critical of the students' disruptions to university life. His isolation was only compounded by articles published in the magazine ''alternative'', which, following the lead of [[Hannah Arendt]]'s articles in ''Merkur'', claimed Adorno had subjected Benjamin to pressure during his years of exile in Berlin and compiled Benjamin's ''Writings'' and ''Letters'' with a great deal of bias. In response, Benjamin's longtime friend [[Gershom Scholem]], wrote to the editor of ''Merkur'' to express his disapproval of the "in part, shameful, not to say disgraceful" remarks by Arendt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between students and the West German state continued deteriorating. In spring 1968, a prominent SDS spokesman, [[Rudi Dutschke]], was gunned down in the streets; in response, massive demonstrations took place, directed in particular against the [[Springer Press]], which had led a campaign to vilify the students. An open appeal published in ''[[Die Zeit]]'', signed by Adorno, called for an inquiry into the social reasons that gave rise to this assassination attempt as well as an investigation into the Springer Press' manipulation of public opinion. At the same time, however, Adorno protested against disruptions of his own lectures and refused to express his solidarity with their political goals, maintaining instead his autonomy as a theoretician. Adorno rejected the so-called unity of theory and praxis advocated by the students and argued that the students' actions were premised upon a mistaken analysis of the situation. The building of barricades, he wrote to Marcuse, is "ridiculous against those who administer the bomb."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1968 Adorno went to Vienna for the publication of ''Alban Berg: Master of the Smallest Link''. Upon his return to Frankfurt, events prevented his concentrating upon the book on aesthetics he wished to write: "Valid student claims and dubious actions," he wrote to Marcuse, "are all so mixed up together that all productive work and even sensible thought are scarcely possible any more."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=464}}&lt;/ref&gt; After striking students threatened to strip the Institute's sociology seminar rooms of their furnishings and equipment, the police were brought in to close the building.

Adorno began writing an introduction to a collection of poetry by Rudolf Borchardt, which was connected with a talk entitled "Charmed Language," delivered in Zurich, followed by a talk on aesthetics in Paris where he met Beckett again. Beginning in October 1966, Adorno took up work on ''Aesthetic Theory''.  In June 1969 he completed ''Catchwords: Critical Models''. During the winter semester of 1968–69 Adorno was on sabbatical leave from the university and thus able to dedicate himself to the completion of his book of aesthetics.

For the summer semester Adorno planned a lecture course entitled "An Introduction to Dialectical Thinking," as well as a seminar on the dialectics of subject and object. But at the first lecture Adorno's attempt to open up the lecture and invite questions whenever they arose degenerated into a disruption from which he quickly fled: after a student wrote on the blackboard "If Adorno is left in peace, capitalism will never cease," three women students approached the lectern, bared their breasts and scattered flower petals over his head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Müller-Doohm|2005|page=475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Adorno continued to resist blanket condemnations of the protest movement which would have only strengthened the conservative thesis according to which political irrationalism was the result of Adorno's teaching. After further disruptions to his lectures, Adorno canceled the lectures for the rest of the seminar, continuing only with his philosophy seminar. In the summer of 1969, weary from these activities, Adorno returned once again to [[Zermatt, Switzerland]], at the foot of Matterhorn to restore his strength. On August 6 he died of a heart attack.

==Theory==
{{Frankfurt School}}
Adorno's work sets out from a central insight he shares with all early 20th century avant-garde art: the recognition of what is primitive in ourselves and the world itself. Neither [[Picasso]]'s fascination with African sculpture nor [[Piet Mondrian|Mondrian]]'s reduction of painting to its most elementary component—the line—is comprehensible outside this concern with [[primitivism]] Adorno shared with the century's most radical art. At that time, the Western world, beset by world-wars, colonialist consolidation and accelerating [[commodification]], sank into the very barbarism civilization had prided itself in overcoming. According to Adorno, society's self-preservation had become indistinguishable from societally sanctioned self-sacrifice: of "primitive" peoples, primitive aspects of the ego and those primitive, mimetic desires found in imitation and sympathy. Adorno's theory proceeds from an understanding of this primitive quality of reality which seeks to counteract whatever aims either to repress this primitive aspect or to further those systems of domination set in place by this return to barbarism. From this perspective, Adorno's writings on politics, philosophy, music and literature are a lifelong critique of the ways in which each tries to justify self-mutilation as the necessary price of self-preservation. According to Adorno's translator Robert Hullot-Kentor, the central motive of Adorno's work thus consists in determining "how life could be more than the struggle for self-preservation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Durão|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the principle of self-preservation, Adorno writes in ''Negative Dialectics'', is nothing but "the law of doom thus far obeyed by history."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2003|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; At its most basic, Adorno's thought is motivated by a fundamental critique of this law.

Adorno was chiefly influenced by [[Max Weber]]'s critique of [[disenchantment]], [[Georg Lukács]]'s Hegelian interpretation of Marxism, as well as [[Walter Benjamin]]'s philosophy of history. Adorno, along with the other major Frankfurt School theorists [[Max Horkheimer]] and [[Herbert Marcuse]], argued that advanced capitalism had managed to contain or liquidate the forces that would bring about its collapse and that the revolutionary moment, when it would have been possible to transform it into socialism, had passed. As he put it at the beginning of his ''[[Negative Dialectics]]'' (1966), philosophy is still necessary because the time to realise it was missed. Adorno argued that capitalism had become more entrenched through its attack on the objective basis of revolutionary consciousness and through liquidation of the individualism that had been the basis of critical consciousness. Adorno, as well as Horkheimer, critiqued all forms of [[positivism]] as responsible for [[technocracy]] and disenchantment and sought to produce a theory that both rejected positivism and avoided reinstating traditional [[metaphysics]]. Adorno and Horkheimer have been criticized for over-applying the term "positivism," especially in their interpretations of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] and [[Karl Popper]] as positivists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Josephson-Storm | first = Jason | title = The Myth of Disenchantment: Magic, Modernity, and the Birth of the Human Sciences | location = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | date = 2017 |pages = 242–5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=xZ5yDgAAQBAJ | isbn = 978-0-226-40336-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===

Adorno criticized [[jazz]] and [[popular music]], viewing it as part of the [[culture industry]], that contributes to the present sustainability of capitalism by rendering it "aesthetically pleasing" and "agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. 'The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope' 2010, p.89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In his early essays for the Vienna-based journal ''Anbruch'', Adorno claimed that musical progress is proportional to the composer's ability to constructively deal with the possibilities and limitations contained within what Adorno called the "musical material." For Adorno, twelve-tone serialism constitutes a decisive, historically developed method of composition. The objective validity of composition, according to Adorno, rests with neither the composer's genius nor the work's conformity with prior standards, but with the way in which the work coherently expresses the dialectic of the material. In this sense, the contemporary absence of composers of the status of Bach or Beethoven is not the sign of musical regression; instead, new music is to be credited with laying bare aspects of the musical material previously repressed: The musical material's liberation from number, the harmonic series and tonal harmony. Thus, historical progress is achieved only by the composer who "submits to the work and seemingly does not undertake anything active except to follow where it leads." Because historical experience and social relations are embedded within this musical material, it is to the analysis of such material that the critic must turn. In the face of this radical liberation of the musical material, Adorno came to criticize those who, like Stravinsky, withdrew from this freedom by taking recourse to forms of the past as well as those who turned twelve-tone composition into a technique which dictated the rules of composition.

Adorno saw the culture industry as an arena in which critical tendencies or potentialities were eliminated. He argued that the culture industry, which produced and circulated cultural commodities through the mass media, manipulated the population. Popular culture was identified as a reason why people become passive; the easy pleasures available through consumption of popular culture made people docile and content, no matter how terrible their economic circumstances. "Capitalist production so confines them, body and soul, that they fall helpless victims to what is offered them."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=123}} The differences among cultural goods make them appear different, but they are in fact just variations on the same theme. He wrote that "the same thing is offered to everybody by the standardized production of consumption goods" but this is concealed under "the manipulation of taste and the official culture's pretense of individualism".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Arato|Gephart|1982|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; By doing so, the culture industry appeals to every single consumer in a unique and personalized way, all while maintaining minimal costs and effort on their behalf. Consumers purchase the illusion that every commodity or product is tailored to the individual's personal preference, by incorporating subtle modifications or inexpensive "add-ons" in order to keep the consumer returning for new purchases, and therefore more revenue for the corporation system. Adorno conceptualized this phenomenon as ''pseudo-individualisation'' and the ''always-the-same''. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Adorno's analysis allowed for a critique of mass culture from the left which balanced the critique of popular culture from the right. From both perspectives—left and right—the nature of cultural production was felt to be at the root of social and moral problems resulting from the consumption of culture. However, while the critique from the right emphasized moral degeneracy ascribed to sexual and racial influences within popular culture, Adorno located the problem not with the content, but with the objective realities of the production of mass culture and its effects, e.g. as a form of [[reverse psychology]]. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Thinkers influenced by Adorno believe that today's society has evolved in a direction foreseen by him, especially in regard to the past ([[Auschwitz]]), morals, or the Culture Industry. The latter has become a particularly productive, yet highly contested term in [[cultural studies]]. Many of Adorno's reflections on aesthetics and music have only just begun to be debated, as a collection of essays on the subject, many of which had not previously been translated into English, has only recently been collected and published as ''Essays on Music''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Adorno|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno's work in the years before his death was shaped by the idea of "negative dialectics", set out especially in his book of that title. A key notion in the work of the Frankfurt School since ''Dialectic of Enlightenment'' had been the idea of thought becoming an instrument of domination that subsumes all objects under the control of the (dominant) subject, especially through the notion of identity, i.e. of identifying as real in nature and society only that which harmonized or fit with dominant concepts, and regarding as unreal or non-existent everything that did not. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}} Adorno's "negative dialectics" was an attempt to articulate a non-dominating thought that would recognize its limitations and accept the non-identity and reality of that which could not be subsumed under the subject's concepts. Indeed, Adorno sought to ground the critical bite of his sociological work in his critique of identity, which he took to be a reification in thought of the commodity form or exchange relation which always presumes a false identity between different things. The potential to criticise arises from the gap between the concept and the object, which can never go into the former without remainder. This gap, this non-identity in identity, was the secret to a critique of both material life and conceptual reflection. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Adorno's reputation as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death.  His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the [[Second Viennese School]] in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him to fall out of favour.  The distinguished American scholar [[Richard Taruskin]]&lt;ref&gt;Taruskin, Richard. ''The Oxford History of Western Music''. Oxford University Press, 2005, p.xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; declared Adorno to be "preposterously over-rated." The eminent pianist and critic [[Charles Rosen]] saw Adorno's book ''The Philosophy of New Music'' as "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." &lt;ref&gt;Rosen, C. (2000, p117) ''Critical Entertainments: Music Old and New''. Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic [[Eric Hobsbawm]] saw Adorno's writings as containing "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz".&lt;ref&gt;Hobsbawm, Eric (1993, p. 300) ''The Jazz Scene'' . New York, Pantheon.&lt;/ref&gt; The British philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] saw Adorno as producing "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. 'The Uses of Pessimism: and the Danger of False Hope' 2010, p.89, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive.  He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: "I have never been able to bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by the way, how he treats Stravinsky." &lt;ref&gt;Letter of 5 December 1949, quoted in Stuckenschmidt, Arnold Schoenberg: His Life, World and Work, trans. H. Searle London: John Calder, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the scholar [[Slavoj Žižek]] has written a foreword to Adorno's ''In Search of Wagner'',&lt;ref&gt;Adorno, Theodor (2005). In Search of Wagner. London and New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt; where Žižek attributes an "emancipatory impulse" to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study."&lt;ref&gt;Žižek, Slavoj. (2005). Foreword: Why Is Wagner Worth Saving? In: Adorno, Theodor. (2005). In Search of Wagner. London and New York: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The five components of recognition ====
Adorno states that a start to understand the recognition in respect of any particular song hit may be made by drafting a scheme which divides the experience of recognition into its different components. All the factors people enumerate are interwoven to a degree that would be impossible to separate from one another in reality. Adorno's scheme is directed towards the different objective elements involved in the experience of recognition, than the actual experience felt for the individual.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Popular Music|last = Adorno|first = Theodor|date = 1941|journal = Essays on Music|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vague remembrance              
# Actual identification      
# Subsumption by label            
# Self-reflection and act of recognition           
# Psychological transfer of recognition-authority to the object

===Marxist criticisms===
Adorno posits social totality as an automatic system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite SEP |url-id=adorno |title=Theodor W. Adorno |last=Zuidervaart |first=Lambert}} According to Adorno, society and culture form a sociohistorical totality, such that the pursuit of freedom in society is inseparable from the pursuit of enlightenment in culture.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Horst Müller's ''Kritik der kritischen Theorie'' ("Critique of Critical Theory"), this assumption is consistent with Adorno's idea of society as a self-regulating system, from which one must escape (but from which nobody ''can'' escape). For him it was existent, but inhuman. Müller argues against the existence of such a system and claims that critical theory provides no practical solution for societal change. He concludes that [[Jürgen Habermas]], in particular, and the Frankfurt School in general, misconstrue Marx.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==Standardization==
The phenomenon of standardization is "a concept used to characterize the formulaic products of capitalist-driven mass media and mass culture that appeal to the lowest common denominator in pursuit of maximum profit".{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=204}} According to Adorno we inhabit a media culture driven society which has product consumption as one of its main characteristics. Mass media is employed to deliver messages about products and services to consumers in order to convince these individuals to purchase the commodity they are advertising. Standardization consists of the production of large amounts of commodities to then pursue consumers in order to gain the maximum profit possible.

They do this, as mentioned above, by individualizing products to give the illusion to consumers that they are in fact purchasing a product or service that was specifically designed for them. Adorno highlights the issues created with the construction of popular music, where different samples of music used in the creation of today's chart-topping songs are put together in order to create, re-create, and modify numerous tracks by using the same variety of samples from one song to another. He makes a distinction between "Apologetic music" and "Critical music". Apologetic music is defined as the highly produced and promoted music of the "pop music" industry: music that is composed of variable parts and interchanged to create several different songs. "The social and psychological functions of popular music [are that it] acts like a social cement"{{sfn|Adorno|1990|loc={{Page needed|date=April 2015}}}} "to keep people obedient and subservient to the status quo of existing power structures."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=125}}

Serious music, according to Adorno, achieves excellence when its whole is greater than the sum of its parts. The example he gives is that of Beethoven's symphonies: "[his] greatness shows itself in the complete subordination of the accidentally private melodic elements to the form as a whole."{{sfn|Laughey|2010|loc=125}}{{incomplete short citation|date=February 2017}}

Standardization not only refers to the products of the culture industry but to the consumers as well: many times every day consumers are bombarded by media advertising. Consumers are pushed and shoved into consuming products and services presented to them by the media system. The masses have become conditioned by the culture industry, which makes the impact of standardization much more important. By not realizing the impact of social media and commercial advertising, the individual is caught in a situation where conformity is the norm. "During consumption the masses become characterized by the commodities which they use and exchange among themselves."{{sfn|Laughey|2007|loc=124}}

===Adorno's responses to his critics===
As a pioneer of a self-reflexive sociology who prefigured [[Bourdieu]]'s ability to factor in the effect of reflection on the societal object, Adorno realized that some criticism (including deliberate disruption of his classes in the 1960s) could never be answered in a dialogue between equals if, as he seems to have believed, what the naive ethnographer or sociologist thinks of a human essence is always changing over time.&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison of Adorno's and Bourdieu's rather divergent conceptions of reflexivity, see: Karakayali, Nedim. [http://soc.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/38/2/351 2004. "Reading Bourdieu with Adorno: The Limits of Critical Theory and Reflexive Sociology," ''Sociology'' (Journal of the British Sociological Association), '''38'''(2), pp. 351–368.]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ffm-adorno-ampel001.jpg|thumb|276px|right|The "Adorno-Ampel" (Adorno-traffic light) on Senckenberganlage, a street which divides the Institute for Social Research from [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]—Adorno requested its construction after a pedestrian death in 1962, and it was finally installed 25 years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rezensionen.ch/buchbesprechungen/frank-berger-christian-setzepfandt-101-unorte-in-frankfurt/3797312482.html|title=Frankfurt gnadenlos entdecken|accessdate=2012-12-16|author1=Berger, Frank |author2=Setzepfandt, Christian |date=2011-05-07|publisher=''[[Rezensionen]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

==Adorno's sociological methods==

As Adorno believed that sociology needs to be self-reflective and self-critical, he also believed that the language the sociologist uses, like the language of the ordinary person, is a political construct in large measure that uses, often unreflectingly, concepts installed by dominant classes and social structures (such as our notion of "deviance" which includes both genuinely deviant individuals and "hustlers" operating below social norms because they lack the capital to operate above: for an analysis of this phenomenon, cf. [[Pierre Bourdieu]]'s book ''The Weight of the World''). He felt that those at the top of the Institute needed to be the source primarily of theories for evaluation and empirical testing, as well as people who would process the "facts" discovered...including revising theories that were found to be false. For example, in an essay published in Germany on Adorno's return from the USA, and reprinted in the ''Critical Models'' essays collection ({{ISBN|0-231-07635-5}}), Adorno praised the [[egalitarianism]] and openness of US society  based on his sojourn in New York and the Los Angeles area between 1935 and 1955: "Characteristic for the life in America [...]is a moment of peacefulness, kindness and generosity". ("Dem amerikanischen Leben eignet [...] ein Moment von Friedlichkeit, Gutartigkeit und Großzügigkeit".)&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Stichworte. Kritische Modelle 2'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1969, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of the clash of intellectual culture and Adorno's methods can be found in [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], the American sociologist for whom Adorno worked in the late 1930s after fleeing Hitler. As Rolf Wiggershaus recounts in ''The Frankfurt School, Its History, Theories and Political Significance'' (MIT 1995), Lazarsfeld was the director of a project, funded and inspired by David Sarnoff (the head of [[RCA]]), to discover both the sort of music that listeners of radio liked and ways to improve their "taste", so that RCA could profitably air more classical music. Lazarsfeld, however, had trouble both with the prose style of the work Adorno handed in and what Lazarsfeld thought was Adorno's "lack of discipline in ... presentation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wiggershaus|1995|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adorno himself provided the following personal anecdote:

{{Quotation|What I mean by reified consciousness, I can illustrate—without elaborate philosophical contemplation—most simply with an American experience. Among the frequently changing colleagues which the Princeton Project provided me with, was a young lady. After a few days, she had gained confidence in me, and asked most kindly: "Dr Adorno, would you mind a personal question?". I said, "It depends on the question, but just go ahead", and she went on: "Please tell me: are you an extrovert or an introvert?". It was as if she, as a living being, already thought according to the model of multi-choice questions in questionnaires.&lt;ref&gt;Theodor W. Adorno, ''Stichworte. Kritische Modelle'', 2nd edition. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1969, p. 122 (also cited in Friedemann Grenz, ''Adornos Philosophie in Grundbegriffen. Auflösung einiger Deutungsprobleme''. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag, 1974, p. 43.).&lt;/ref&gt; }}

==Adorno translated into English==
While even German readers can find Adorno's work difficult to understand, an additional problem for English readers is that his German idiom is particularly difficult to translate into English. A similar difficulty of translation is true of [[Hegel]], [[Heidegger]], and a number of other German philosophers and poets. As a result, some early translators tended toward over-literalness. In recent years, [[Edmund Jephcott]] and [[Stanford University Press]] have published new translations of some of Adorno's lectures and books, including ''Introduction to Sociology'', ''Problems of Moral Philosophy'' and his transcribed lectures on Kant's ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and Aristotle's "Metaphysics", and a new translation of the ''[[Dialectic of Enlightenment]]''. Professor Henry Pickford, of the University of Colorado at Boulder, has translated many of Adorno's works such as "The Meaning of Working Through the Past." A new translation has also appeared of ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'' and the ''Philosophy of New Music'' by [[Robert Hullot-Kentor]], from the [[University of Minnesota Press]]. Hullot-Kentor is also currently working on a new translation of ''Negative Dialectics''. Adorno's correspondence with Alban Berg, ''Towards a Theory of Musical Reproduction'', and the letters to Adorno's parents, have been translated by [[Wieland Hoban]] and published by [[Polity Press]]. These fresh translations are slightly less literal in their rendering of German sentences and words, and are more accessible to English readers. {{citation needed|date=April 2010}}  The Group Experiment, which had been unavailable to English readers, is now available in an accessible translation by Jeffrey K. Olick and Andrew J. Perrin on Harvard University Press, along with introductory material explaining its relation to the rest of Adorno's work and 20th-century public opinion research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3616">'''Toxicokinetics''' (often abbreviated as 'TK') is the description of both what rate a chemical will enter the body and what occurs to excrete and metabolize the compound once it is in the body.

==Relation to Pharmacokinetics==
It is an application of [[pharmacokinetics]] to determine the relationship between the systemic exposure of a compound and its [[toxin|toxicity]].  It is used primarily for establishing relationships between exposures in [[toxicology]] experiments in animals and the corresponding exposures in humans. However, it can also be used in environmental risk assessments in order to determine the potential effects of releasing chemicals into the environment. In order to quantify toxic effects toxicokinetics can be combined with toxicodynamics. Such toxicokinetic-toxicodynamic (TKTD) models are used in ecotoxicology (see [http://www.ecotoxmodels.org ecotoxmodels] a website on mathematical models in ecotoxicology).

Similarly, physiological toxicokinetic models are [[PBPK|physiological pharmacokinetic models]] developed to describe and predict the behavior of a toxicant in an animal body; for example, what parts (compartments) of the body a chemical may tend to enter (e.g. fat, liver, spleen, etc.), and whether or not the chemical is expected to be metabolized or excreted and at what rate.

==Processes==
Four potential processes exist for a chemical interacting with an animal: [[absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorption]], distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME). Absorption describes the entrance of the chemical into the body, and can occur through the air, water, food, or soil. Once a chemical is inside a body, it can be distributed to other areas of the body through diffusion or other biological processes. At this point, the chemical may undergo metabolism and be biotransformed into other chemicals (metabolites). These metabolites can be less or more toxic than the parent compound. After this potential biotransformation occurs, the metabolites may leave the body, be transformed into other compounds, or continue to be stored in the body compartments.

A well designed toxicokinetic study may involve several different strategies and depends on the scientific question to be answered.  Controlled [[Acute toxicity|acute]] and repeated toxicokinetic animal studies are useful to identify a chemical's biological persistence, tissue and whole body [[half-life]], and its potential to bioaccumulate. Toxicokinetic profiles can change with increasing exposure duration or dose. Real world environmental exposures generally occur as low level mixtures, such as from air, water, food, or tobacco products. Mixture effects may differ from individual chemical toxicokinetic profiles because of chemical interactions, synergistic, or competitive processes. For other reasons, it is equally important to characterize the toxicokinetics of individual chemicals constituents found in mixtures as information on behavior or fate of the individual chemical can help explain environmental, human, and wildlife biomonitoring studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Diliberto JJ, Hakk H, Huwe JK, Birnbaum LS |title=Toxicokinetics of the flame retardant hexabromocyclododecane gamma: effect of dose, timing, route, repeated exposure, and metabolism |journal=Toxicological Sciences |volume=117 |issue=2 |pages=282–93 |year=2010 |doi=10.1093/toxsci/kfq183|url= http://toxsci.oxfordjournals.org/content/117/2/282 |pmid=20562218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Transport finance''' is the subject that explores how [[transport]] networks are paid for.    

The timing of the money required to finance transport is a principal issue.  Many projects are "[[PAYGO|pay-as-you-go]]", that is infrastructure, which lasts many years, is expected to be paid out of ongoing cash flow.  Other projects are financed with [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] raised in [[capital market]]s. Bonds must be secured with an expected future cash flow.  

The cash flow, required for either pay-as-you-go or for bonds, must be raised.  Common sources are [[user fee]]s, such as [[gas tax]]es, and [[Toll road|toll]]s.  Other sources are [[revenue|general revenue]].  This issue is related to who bears the burden: users or the general public.  Even if users bear the burden, that class must be subdivided, e.g. users during peak times or off-peak, freight or passenger traffic, urban or rural users, residents or non-residents (many toll plazas are located on the state line to maximize revenue from non-residents).

A third issue concerns the [[full cost]]s of transportation.  There are monetary costs, which are financed with money, as considered above, but there are also non-monetary costs (sometimes called [[hidden cost]]s), which are paid for by people's time, by clean air, by peace and quiet, etc.  See the discussion of [[externalities]] for a fuller explication of non-monetary costs.

The '''University of Louvain'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/016709801#Graphic_representation|title=University of Louvain - EUTM file information|last=|first=|date=|year=|website=European Union Intellectual Property Office|orig-year=2017|access-date=May 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fr|Université catholique de Louvain}}, '''UCLouvain''') is [[Belgium]]'s largest [[French language|French]]-speaking [[university]]. It is located in [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], which was expressly built to house the university, and [[Brussels]], [[Charleroi]], [[Mons]] and [[Tournai]]. From September 2018 onwards, the university is called '''UCLouvain''' in the context of a merger with [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]].

The University of Louvain (''Universitas Lovaniensis'') was founded at the centre of the historic town of [[Leuven]] (or ''Louvain'') in 1425, making it the first university in Belgium and the [[Low Countries]]. After being closed in 1797 during the Napoleonic period, the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834-1968)|''Catholic'' University of Leuven]] was "re-founded" in 1834, and is frequently, but controversially, identified as a continuation of the older institution.{{ref|caveat|A}}{{ref|caveat2|B}} In 1968 the Catholic University of Leuven split into the Dutch-language ''[[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]]'', which stayed in Leuven, and the French-language ''Université catholique de Louvain'', which moved to [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] in [[Wallonia]], 30&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[Brussels]]. Since the 15th century, ''Leuven/Louvain'', as it is still often called, has been a major contributor to the development of Catholic theology.

==History==
{{For|the history of the university prior to 1968|Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)#History}}

The [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]], based in [[Leuven]] ("''Louvain''" in French), 30&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Brussels]], provided lectures in French from its refounding in 1835, and in Dutch from 1930. In 1968, the [[Dutch-language]] section became the independent [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], which remained in Leuven, while the French-speaking university was moved to a greenfield campus and town, [[Ottignies-Louvain-la-Neuve|Louvain-la-Neuve]], 30&amp;nbsp;km south-east of Brussels, in a part of the country where French is the official language. This separation also entailed dividing existing library holdings between the two new universities.

With the democratization of university education already stretching existing structures, plans to expand the French-speaking part of the university at a campus in [[Brussels]] or [[Wallonia]] were quietly discussed from the early 1960s, but it was not anticipated that the French-speaking section would become an entirely independent university and lose all of its buildings and infrastructure in [[Leuven]]. The first stone of the new campus at Louvain-la-Neuve was laid in 1971, and the transfer of faculties to the new site was completed in 1979.

== Chronology ==
In 1425, Dukes of Brabant created the University of Louvain&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UNIVERSITÉ DE LOUVAIN|url = http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/universite-de-louvain/|website = Encyclopædia Universalis|access-date = 2016-02-23|first = Encyclopædia|last = Universalis}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Université de Louvain) and has been deleted under Joseph II and under the French Republic.

In 1817, the University of the State of Louvain (''Université de l'Etat de Louvain'') was founded and closed 15 August 1835.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = La matricule de l'Universite de Louvain (1817-1835)|last = Graffart|first = Arlette|publisher = Album de Carlos Wyffels|year = 1987|isbn = |location = Bruxelles|pages = 181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, bishops of Belgium created the Belgium Catholic University (Université Catholique de Belgique) also known under the name Catholic University of Malines (Université Catholique de Malines).

In 1835, near after the suppression of the University of the State of Louvain (Université de l'Etat de Louvain), the Belgium Catholic University (Université Catholique de Belgique) set up to Louvain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Dictionnaire de l'histoire universelle de l'Eglise|last = Encyclopedie theologique|first = |publisher = J.P. Migne|year = 1863|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The advantage of the city of Louvain was its reputation of old university residence.

The law voted 27 September 1835 stated that there would be only one university funded by the State of Belgium in Louvain. By consequence, the Catholic University of Malines (Université catholique de Malines) moved to Louvain, took the advantage of the reputation of the city and adopted a new name: Catholic University of Louvain (Université Catholique de Louvain).

In a catholic winning back spirit established by the pope Grégoire XVI,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Les annees Lovanium|last = Ndaywel è Nziem|first = Isidore|publisher = L'Harmattan|year = 2010|isbn = |location = Paris|pages = 19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the promoter and first rector Monseigneur de Ram wanted to create a shield which will repulse religion's enemies and block every doctrines weakening the catholic society bases.

In 1845: foundation of the Pharmacy school

1865: Creation of the engineering schools

In 1884: The University of Louvain celebrated its fiftieth anniversary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Universite Catholique de Louvain: Liber Memorialis: 1834-1884|last = Descamps|first = E.|publisher = Peeters|year = 1887|isbn = |location = Louvain|pages = V}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, as a result of the linguistic issues, the University is divided in two different universities: one French speaking which will be built in the province of Brabant Wallon and one Dutch which stayed in the same infrastructure.

In 1970, these two universities are established by law: ''Katholieke Universiteit Leuven'' and ''Université Catholique de Louvain''.

In 1971, laying of the first foundation stone in Louvain-la-Neuve. New city reserved for the French speaking infrastructure.

==Prospects==
According to a 2007 agreement, the University of Louvain was to absorb three smaller French-speaking catholic colleges: the [[Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix|Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]] ([[FUNDP]]) located in [[Namur (city)|Namur]], the [[Facultés Universitaires Saint-Louis|Facultés universitaires Saint-Louis]] ([[FUSL]]) located in Brussels (now called Saint-Louis University, Brussels (USL-B)) and the [[Catholic university of Mons]] ([[FUCaM]]) located in [[Mons]] and [[Charleroi]]. The negotiations for a full merger aborted by an insufficient vote by the general assembly of [[Facultés Universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix|Facultés universitaires Notre-Dame de la Paix]] ([[FUNDP]]) in December 2010. The result was a merger between the University of Louvain and [[Facultés universitaires catholiques de Mons]] (FUCaM) in [[Mons]], effective from September 15, 2011. The Mons campus is denoted UCLouvain FUCaM Mons. The three universities still collaborate in consortium, the "Academie Louvain". Within this group, member universities have coordinated their masters programmes in the fields of economics, management, political sciences and sciences as well as the doctoral programmes in all disciplines.,

From September 2018, the University of Louvain and [[Saint-Louis University, Brussels]] will ''[[de facto]]'' merge and share the name UCLouvain.

==Student activities==

===Cercles===
''Cercles'' are [[Student society|Student Societies]] or [[Fraternities and sororities|Fraternities]] based around each faculty.  The Cercles, along with the Régionales (which are based around their respective regions of origin) coordinate and manage most of the students' animation and nightlife.  Most Cercles run small bars to fund their activities, and also jointly operate a larger nightclub, "La Casa".

Cercles and Régionales are run exclusively by member students known as the Committee.  These members are elected every year, usually by voting from all members (active or otherwise) wishing to participate, although some Cercles restrict the number of possible voters in some cases.

Aside from promoting student folklore and coordinating student animation, Cercles also offer academic aid to students in their respective faculties and organize more cultural activities, such as visits to museums and/or other cities, conferences, and low-cost trips for students (for example skiing in the Alps during the Winter Break).

Every Cercle and Régionale has its own customs and traditions, but some are practiced by all :

The Baptême ({{lang-fr|baptism}}) is a [[hazing]] ceremony used by most to induct new members, who then participate in a number of trials and activities involving eggs and other foodstuff, paint, demeaning chants etc.  Baptized members (les Baptisés) are among the most common type of members, and some Cercles and Régionales try to only accept new members this way, although "it is in no way an obligation to be baptized in order to be a part of the Cercle or to frequent them".

The [[Calotte (Belgium)|calotte]] is a Belgian [[student cap]] worn by students attending Catholic universities.  They are emblems of student folklore dating back to the late 19th century.  Nowadays, most calottes are passed by way of a ceremony known as the coronae.  How they are passed and what must be known or done to deserve it depends on the Cercle or Régionale.  One thing that is universally known, is that there is a lot of singing involved.

Cercles are notorious for their generally high output of alcohol (especially beer) and low level of cleanliness.  Students tend to wear old clothes that they don't mind damaging or dirtying as a consequence, and the overall ambiance is more akin to a rave or a frat-party than a nightclub or sports bar.

===Kots===
Student accommodation in Belgium comes in the form of a "[[Kot (lodging)|kot]]", a term having [[Flemish|Belgian Dutch]] origin. A "kot" can be translated as den or hut. The French way to form the plural of "kot" is "kots" (in Dutch, the plural of "kot" is "koten"). In the bilingual region of Brussels, where there are both Dutch- and French-speaking universities and their students, it is common that "for rent" signs are in French only, with the French plural of "kot".

===Kot-à-projet===
{{main|Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)}}

Unique to UCLouvain a [[Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)|Kot-à-projet]] (kap) is a kot whose inhabitants have similar interests and who organise activities for the general student population, they are similar to [[Fraternity and sorority houses]], but smaller in size with only the committee living in the kot. Being small several Kots can be situated in the same, university owned, apartment building. One of them is "le kap contes", a kot promoting the art of storytelling. Another is called "Kap Délices" which suggests lots of activities as theme buffets, cooking lessons, material renting and a lot of other things related to cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kapdelices.net |title=Kap Délices &amp;#124; Accueil |publisher=Kapdelices.net |date= |accessdate=2012-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student Union===
The AGL (General Assembly of Louvain students) is the UCLouvain's [[Students' union]]. The body comprises an [[Executive (government)|executive]] Committee, and a [[Legislature|legislative]] Council. The Committee consists of ex-officio members: President, Vice-Presidents for Education &amp; Welfare, VP for the Medicine faculty (Situated in [[Woluwe-Saint-Lambert]]), General Secretary, Activities Officer, Communications Officer, Operations Officer, Foreign student's Officer, Cultural Officer, [[Editing#Executive editor|Editor-in-Chief]] &amp; Deputy Editor-in-Chief as well as the president of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aglouvain.be/wiki/index.php/Comit%E9 |title=Archived copy |access-date=11 October 2017 |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20171011031126/http://www.aglouvain.be/wiki/index.php/Comit%E9 |archive-date=11 October 2017 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
''Quinzaine'' a University produced newsletter, ''La Savate'' produced by the AGL and the monthly ''l'étincelle'' by the [[Theme-based shared flat (kot-à-projet)|Kot-à-projet]] KAP Etincelle. Cercles also produce publications.

===24h Vélo===
[[File:24h velo (LLN) (1808220531).jpg|thumb|A fanciful bike [[float (parade)|float]] at the [[24h vélo de Louvain-la-Neuve]]]]
{{main|24h velo (LLN)}}

The 24 Hour Cycle (24h Vélo) is, nominally, a [[bicycle]] endurance [[Road bicycle racing|road race]] held in October, organised by  ''CSE Animations'' (Centre Sportif Etudiant). While there is an elite race with teams of two, Student groups enter novelty themed multi-bike vehicles, in the shape of a Van or Whale for example, for prizes. The quality of these designs range in terms of artistic merit, and ability to stay intact over the duration of the race. A 240-minute race also takes place for teenagers. The event is probably best known for what happens off the track. Concurrent with the race is [[Belgium]]'s largest student event, with concerts and stands lasting the full 24hrs.

==Notes==
:A.{{note|caveat}} The Old University of Leuven (1425) is the oldest university in the low countries, and the Catholic University of Leuven (1834) is sometimes, controversially, identified as a continuation of it. It should be noted that Belgium's highest court, the [[Court of Cassation (Belgium)|Court of Cassation]] has ruled that the (1834) Catholic University of Leuven cannot be regarded as continuing the old (1425) University of Leuven.&lt;ref&gt;Ruling of the Cour de Cassation of Belgium of 26 November 1846: "''The Catholic University of Leuven can not be regarded as continuing the old University of Leuven''", in, ''Table générale alphabétique et chronologique de la Pasicrisie Belge contenant la jurisprudence du Royaume de 1814 à 1850'', Brussels, 1855, p. 585, column 1, alinea 2. See also: ''Bulletin Usuel des Lois et Arrêtés'', 1861, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Old University of Leuven#History]].
:B.{{note|caveat2}} This is a relatively recent phenomenon. In 1884, the university celebrated its 50th anniversary, acknowledging its actual date of foundation.&lt;ref&gt;In the year 1887, the Catholic University of Louvain, has celebrated his 50th anniversary.... E. Descamps, in : ''Université Catholique de Louvain : Liber Memorialis : 1834-1884'', Louvain : Peeters, 1887, p. V : "''les fêtes du cinquantième anniversaire de l'Université catholique de Louvain ont eu un brillant éclat et un immense retentissement''".&lt;/ref&gt; Only in 1968 did the new Catholic university dare to add the date 1425 to its neo-gothic seal (created, without the date, in 1909).

'''Utopian socialism''' is a label used to define the first currents of modern [[Socialism|socialist]] thought as exemplified by the work of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Henri de Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Étienne Cabet]] and [[Robert Owen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/heavenonearth/synopsis.html|title=Heaven on Earth: The Rise and Fall of Socialism|publisher=Public Broadcasting System|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopian socialism is often described as the presentation of visions and outlines for imaginary or futuristic ideal societies, with positive ideals being the main reason for moving society in such a direction. Later socialists and critics of utopian socialism viewed "utopian socialism" as not being grounded in actual material conditions of existing society and in some cases as reactionary. These visions of ideal societies competed with [[Marxist]]-inspired revolutionary social democratic movements.&lt;ref name="Draper"&gt;{{cite book|last=Draper|first=Hal|title=Karl Marx's Theory of Revolution, Volume IV: Critique of Other Socialisms|year=1990|publisher=Monthly Review Press|location=New York|isbn=0853457980|pages=1–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is most often applied to those socialists who lived in the first quarter of the 19th century who were ascribed the label "utopian" by later socialists as a [[pejorative]] in order to imply ''naiveté'' and to dismiss their ideas as fanciful and unrealistic.&lt;ref name="SocialismAVeryShortIntroduction"&gt;''Newman, Michael''. (2005) ''Socialism: A Very Short Introduction'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-280431-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar school of thought that emerged in the early 20th century is [[ethical socialism]], which makes the case for socialism on moral grounds.

However, one key difference between utopian socialists and other socialists (including most [[anarchists]]) is that utopian socialists generally do not believe any form of class struggle or political revolution is necessary for socialism to emerge. Utopians believe that people of all classes can voluntarily adopt their plan for society if it is presented convincingly.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt; They feel their form of cooperative socialism can be established among like-minded people within the existing society and that their small communities can demonstrate the feasibility of their plan for society.&lt;ref name="Draper"/&gt;

== Definition ==
{{see also|Utopia}}
The thinkers identified as utopian socialist did not use the term "utopian" to refer to their ideas. [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] were the first thinkers to refer to them as "utopian", referring to all socialist ideas that simply presented a vision and distant goal of an ethically just society as utopian. This utopian mindset which held an integrated conception of the goal, the means to produce said goal and an understanding of the way that those means would inevitably be produced through examining social and economic phenomena can be contrasted with [[scientific socialism]], which has been likened to [[Taylorism]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2017}}

This distinction was made clear in Engels' work ''[[Socialism: Utopian and Scientific]]'' (1892, part of an earlier publication, the ''[[Anti-Dühring]]'' from 1878). Utopian socialists were seen as wanting to expand the principles of the French revolution in order to create a more "rational" society. Despite being labeled as utopian by later socialists, their aims were not always utopian and their values often included rigid support for the scientific method and the creation of a society based upon scientific understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1880/soc-utop/ch01.htm|title=Socialism: Utopian and Scientific (Chpt. 1)|author=Frederick Engels|publisher=Marxists.org|accessdate=July 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The term "utopian socialism" was introduced by Karl Marx in "For a Ruthless Criticism of Everything" in 1843 (and then developed in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' in 1848), although shortly before its publication Marx had already attacked the ideas of [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] in ''[[The poverty of philosophy|Das Elend der Philosophie]]'' (originally written in French, 1847). The term was used by later socialist thinkers to describe early socialist or quasi-socialist intellectuals who created hypothetical visions of [[egalitarian]], [[communalist]], [[meritocratic]], or other notions of "perfect" societies without considering how these societies could be created or sustained.

In ''Das Elend der Philosophie'', English title ''The Poverty of Philosophy'', Marx criticized the [[Economics|economic]] and [[philosophy|philosophical]] arguments of Proudhon set forth in ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]''. Marx accused Proudhon of wanting to rise above the [[bourgeoisie]]. In the history of Marx's thought and [[Marxism]], this work is pivotal in the distinction between the concepts of utopian socialism and what Marx and the Marxists claimed as scientific socialism.

Although utopian socialists shared few political, social, or economic perspectives, Marx and Engels argued that they shared certain intellectual characteristics. In ''The Communist Manifesto'',&lt;ref&gt;Engels, Friedrich and Marx, Karl Heinrich. »Manifest der Kommunistischen Partei«. Edited by Sálvio M. Soares. MetaLibri, October 31, 2008, v1.0s.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx and Engels wrote: "The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of every member of society, even that of the most favored. Hence, they habitually appeal to society at large, without distinction of class; nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people, when once they understand their system, fail to see it in the best possible plan of the best possible state of society? Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary, action; they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, and endeavor, by small experiments, necessarily doomed to failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social Gospel".

Marx and Engels used the term "scientific socialism" to describe the type of socialism they saw themselves developing. According to Engels, socialism was not "an accidental discovery of this or that ingenious brain, but the necessary outcome of the struggle between two historically developed classes{{spaced ndash}}the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Its task was no longer to manufacture a system of society as perfect as possible, but to examine the historical-economic succession of events from which these classes and their antagonism had of necessity sprung, and to discover in the economic conditions thus created the means of ending the conflict".

Critics have argued that utopian socialists who established experimental communities were in fact trying to apply the [[scientific method]] to human social organization and were therefore not utopian. For instance, [[Joshua Muravchik]] on the basis of [[Karl Popper]]'s definition of science as "the practice of experimentation, of hypothesis and test" argued that "Owen and Fourier and their followers were the real ‘scientific socialists.’ They hit upon the idea of socialism, and they tested it by attempting to form socialist communities". Muravchik further argued that in contrast Marx made untestable predictions about the future and that Marx's view that socialism would be created by impersonal historical forces may lead one to conclude that it is unnecessary to strive for socialism because it will happen anyway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aei.org/publication/the-rise-and-fall-of-socialism/ The Rise and Fall of Socialism] Joshua Muravchik SPEECHES AEI Bradley Lecture Series Publication Date: February 8, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the mid-19th century, [[Marxism]] and [[Marxism–Leninism]] overtook utopian socialism in terms of intellectual development and number of adherents. At one time almost half the population of the world lived under regimes that claimed to be Marxist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyguide.org/intellect/marx.html|author=Steven Kreis|title=Karl Marx, 1818-1883|publisher=The History Guide|date=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currents like [[Saint-Simonianism]] and [[Fourierism]] attracted the interest of numerous later authors but failed to compete with the now dominant Marxist, Proudhonist, or Leninist schools on a political level. It has been noted that they exerted a significant influence on the emergence of new religious movements such as [[spiritualism]] and [[occult]]ism.&lt;ref&gt;Strube, Julian (2016). "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0048721X.2016.1146926 Socialist Religion and the Emergence of Occultism: A Genealogical Approach to Socialism and Secularization in 19th-Century France]."

''Aries'' 16/1, pp. 13–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature and in practice ==
Perhaps the first utopian socialist was [[Thomas More]] (1478–1535), who wrote about an imaginary socialist society in his book ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'', published in 1516. The contemporary definition of the English word "utopia" derives from this work and many aspects of More's description of Utopia were influenced by life in [[monasteries]].&lt;ref name="Davis1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=J. C.

[[File:Ehrerbietige Vorstellung und Einladung an meine lieben Mitmenschen.pdf|thumb|Utopian socialist pamphlet of Swiss social medical doctor [[Rudolf Sutermeister]] (1802–1868)]]
[[Saint-Simonianism]] was a [[France|French]] political and social movement of the first half of the 19th century, inspired by the ideas of [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon]] (1760–1825). His ideas influenced [[Auguste Comte]] (who was, for a time, Saint-Simon's secretary), [[Karl Marx]], [[John Stuart Mill]] and many other thinkers and social theorists.

[[Robert Owen]] (1771–1858) was a successful Welsh businessman who devoted much of his profits to improving the lives of his employees. His reputation grew when he set up a textile factory in [[New Lanark]], [[Scotland]], co-funded by his teacher, the [[Utilitarianism|utilitarian]] [[Jeremy Bentham]] and introduced shorter working hours, schools for children and renovated housing. He wrote about his ideas in his book ''A New View of Society'' which was published in 1813 and ''An Explanation of the Cause of Distress which pervades the civilized parts of the world'' in 1823. He also set up an [[Owenite]] commune called [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in [[Indiana]]. This collapsed when one of his business partners ran off with all the profits. Owen's main contribution to socialist thought was the view that human social behavior is not fixed or absolute and that humans have the free will to organize themselves into any kind of society they wished.

[[Charles Fourier]] (1772–1837) rejected the [[industrial revolution]] altogether and thus the problems that arose with it, Fourier made various fanciful claims about the ideal world he envisioned. Despite some clearly non-socialist inclinations,{{Clarify|date=November 2010}} he contributed significantly even if indirectly to the socialist movement. His writings about turning work into play influenced the young Karl Marx and helped him devise his [[Marx's theory of alienation|theory of alienation]]. Also a contributor to [[feminism]], Fourier invented the concept of ''[[phalanstère]]'', units of people based on a theory of passions and of their combination. Several colonies based on Fourier's ideas were founded in the United States by [[Albert Brisbane]] and [[Horace Greeley]].

[[Étienne Cabet]] (1788–1856), influenced by Robert Owen, published a book in 1840 entitled ''Travel and adventures of Lord William Carisdall in Icaria'' in which he described an ideal [[communalist]] society. His attempts to form real socialist communities based on his ideas through the [[Icarians|Icarian movement]] did not survive, but one such community was the precursor of [[Corning, Iowa]]. Possibly inspired by [[Christianity]], he coined the word "communism" and influenced other thinkers, including Marx and Engels.

[[Edward Bellamy]] (1850–1898) published ''[[Looking Backward]]'' in 1888, a utopian romance novel about a future socialist society. In Bellamy's utopia, property was held in common and money replaced with a system of equal credit for all. Valid for a year and non-transferable between individuals, credit expenditure was to be tracked via "credit-cards" (which bear no resemblance to modern credit cards which are tools of debt-finance). Labour was compulsory from age 21 to 40 and organised via various departments of an Industrial Army to which most citizens belonged. Working hours were to be cut drastically due to technological advances (including organisational). People were expected to be motivated by a Religion of Solidarity and criminal behavior was treated as a form of mental illness or "atavism". The book ranked as second or third best seller of its time (after ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and ''Ben Hur''). In 1897, Bellamy published a sequel entitled ''Equality'' as a reply to his critics and which lacked the Industrial Army and other authoritarian aspects.

[[William Morris]] (1834–1896) published ''[[News from Nowhere]]'' in 1890, partly as a response to Bellamy's ''Looking Backwards'', which he equated with the socialism of Fabians such as Sydney Webb. Morris' vision of the future socialist society was centred around his concept of useful work as opposed to useless toil and the redemption of human labour. Morris believed that all work should be artistic, in the sense that the worker should find it both pleasurable and an outlet for creativity. Morris' conception of labour thus bears strong resemblance to Fourier's, while Bellamy's (the reduction of labour) is more akin to that of Saint-Simon or in aspects Marx.

The [[Brotherhood Church]] in Britain and the [[Life and Labor Commune]] in Russia were based on the [[Christian anarchist]] ideas of [[Leo Tolstoy]] (1828–1910).

[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon]] (1809–1865) and [[Peter Kropotkin]] (1842–1921) wrote about anarchist forms of socialism in their books. Proudhon wrote ''[[What is Property?]]'' (1840) and ''[[The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty]]'' (1847). Kropotkin wrote ''[[The Conquest of Bread]]'' (1892) and ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops]]'' (1912). Many of the anarchist collectives formed in [[Spain]], especially in [[Aragon]] and [[Catalonia]], during the [[Spanish Civil War]] were based on their ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sam Dolgoff|authorlink=Sam Dolgoff|title=[[The Anarchist Collectives: Workers' Self-Management in the Spanish Revolution, 1936–1939]]|publisher=Black Rose Books|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many participants in the historical [[kibbutz]] movement in [[Israel]] were motivated by utopian socialist ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=From utopia to total institution in a single generation: the kibbutz and Bruderhof|author=Sheldon Goldenberg and Gerda R. Wekerle|journal=International Review of Modern Sociology|volume=2|issue=2|date=September 1972|pages=224–232|jstor=41420450}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Augustin Souchy]] (1892–1984) spent most of his life investigating and participating in many kinds of socialist communities. Souchy wrote about his experiences in his autobiography ''Beware! Anarchist!''.

[[Behavioral psychologist]] [[B.F. Skinner]] (1904–1990) published ''[[Walden Two]]'' in 1948. The [[Twin Oaks Community]] was originally based on his ideas.

[[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (born 1929) wrote about an impoverished anarchist society in her book ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' published in 1974 and in which the anarchists agree to leave their home planet and colonize a barely habitable moon in order to avoid a bloody revolution.

== Related concepts ==
Some communities of the modern [[intentional community]] movement, such as [[kibbutzim]], could be categorized as utopian socialist.

For example, religious sects whose members live communally such as the [[Hutterites]] or [[Bruderhof Communities]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://christlife.org/blog/learning-from-the-bruderhof-an-intentional-christian-community|title=Learning from the Bruderhof: An Intentional Christian Community|work=ChristLife|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not usually called "utopian socialists", although their way of living is a prime example. They have been categorized as [[religious socialism|religious socialists]] by some.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L1VwVSDBleUC&amp;pg=PA61|title=America's Economic Moralists: A History of Rival Ethics and Economics|author=Donald E. Frey|publisher=SUNY Press|date=2009|page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classless modes of production in [[hunter-gatherer]] societies are referred to as "[[primitive communism]]" by Marxists to stress their classless nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://socialistworker.co.uk/art/33429/Primitive+communism%3A+life+before+class+and+oppression|title=Primitive communism: life before class and oppression|publisher=Socialist Worker|date=May 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A related concept is that of a socialist utopia, usually depicted in works of fiction as possible ways society can turn out to be in the future and often combined with notions of a technologically revolutionized economy.

The '''World Jewish Congress''' ('''WJC''') was founded in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], in August 1936 as an international federation of [[Jews|Jewish]] communities and organizations. According to its mission statement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title=World Jewish Congress - About Us}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Jewish Congress' main purpose is to act as "the diplomatic arm of the Jewish people." Membership in the WJC is open to all representative Jewish groups or communities, irrespective of the social, political or economic ideology of the community's host country. The World Jewish Congress headquarters are in [[New York City]], US, and the organization maintains international offices in [[Brussels, Belgium]]; [[Jerusalem, Israel]]; [[Paris, France]]; [[Moscow, Russia]]; [[Buenos Aires, Argentina]]; and [[Geneva, Switzerland]]. The WJC has [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|special consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]].

== Organization and related bodies ==
The WJC is made up of five regional branches: WJC [[North America]], the Latin American Jewish Congress, the [[European Jewish Congress]], the Euro-Asian Jewish Congress, and the WJC Israel. Besides that, Jewish umbrella organizations in 100 countries are directly affiliated to the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title= World Jewish Congress - About Us|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its highest decision-making body is the Plenary Assembly, which meets every four years and elects the lay leadership (Executive Committee) of the WJC. In between plenary assemblies, meetings of the WJC Governing Board are normally held once a year. Affiliated Jewish organizations send delegates to these two WJC bodies; their number depends on the size of the Jewish communities they represent.

A special meeting of the Plenary Assembly, attended by over 400 delegates and observers from over 70 countries, was held in Buenos Aires in March 2015. The last regular plenary assembly was held In New York in April 2017, and prior to that in Budapest in May 2013, with 600 delegates and observers in attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/jewish-world-news/hungarian-prime-minister-to-address-world-jewish-congress-in-budapest.premium-1.519110|title=Hungarian Prime Minister to Address World Jewish Congress in Budapest|first=Judy|last=Maltz|date=3 May 2013|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also maintains a Research Institute based in Jerusalem, Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/instwjc.html|title=Institute of the World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2012-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is involved in research and analysis of a variety of issues of importance to contemporary Jewry, and its findings are published in the form of policy dispatches.

[[File:Shimon Peres - World Jewish Congress - September 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Israel's President [[Shimon Peres]] addresses a Governing Board meeting of the WJC in Jerusalem, August 2010]]Operating under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress in Israel, the [[Israel Council on Foreign Relations]] has since its inception in 1989 hosted heads of state, prime ministers, foreign ministers and other distinguished visitors to Israel and has issued several publications on Israeli foreign policy and international affairs, including its tri-annual foreign policy journal, [[Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs|the Israel Journal of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israelcfr.com/about-icfr.php?inp=1|title=Israel Council on Foreign Relations About Page|accessdate=2012-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140703161835/http://www.israelcfr.com/about-icfr.php?inp=1|archive-date=2014-07-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC's current policy priorities include combating anti-Semitism, especially the rise of neo-Nazi parties in Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2013/05/10/world-jewish-congress-demands-action-against-neo-nazis/|title=World Jewish Congress demands action against neo-Nazis - Budapest Times, 10 May 2013|publisher=|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203020621/http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2013/05/10/world-jewish-congress-demands-action-against-neo-nazis/|archive-date=2013-12-03|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; providing political support for Israel, opposing the "Iranian threat", and dealing with the legacy of the Holocaust, notably with respect to property restitution, reparation and compensation for Holocaust survivors, as well as with Holocaust remembrance. One of the WJC's major programs is concerned with the plight of [[Jewish exodus from Arab and Muslim countries]]. The WJC is also involved in [[Religious pluralism|inter-faith dialogue]] with Christian and Muslim groups.

===Current World Jewish Congress leadership===
At the 13th Plenary Assembly in Jerusalem in January 2009, [[Ronald S. Lauder]] was formally and unanimously elected as WJC president, having previously served as acting president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/34154|publisher=European Jewish Press|title=Ronald S.

==History==
The World Jewish Congress was established in Geneva, [[Switzerland]] in August, 1936, in reaction to the rise of Nazism and the growing wave of European anti-Semitism. Since its foundation, it has been a permanent body with offices around the world. The main aims of the organization were "to mobilize the Jewish people and the democratic forces against the Nazi onslaught", to "fight for equal political and economic rights everywhere, and particularly for the Jewish minorities in Central and Eastern Europe", to support the establishment of a "Jewish National Home in Palestine" and to create "a worldwide Jewish representative body based on the concept of the unity of the Jewish people, democratically organized and able to act on matters of common concern".&lt;ref name="Garai"&gt;George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, Geneva 1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishgen.org/databases/holocaust/0131_World_Jewish_Congress.html|title=World Jewish Collection – An Introduction by Nolan Altman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor organizations (1917-1936)===
The WJC's precursor organizations were the [[American Jewish Congress]] and the ''Comité des Délégations Juives'' (Committee of Jewish Delegations). The latter was established in March 1919 to represent Jewish communities at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]], and advocated for Jewish minority rights in various countries, including the negotiation of rights for Jews in Turkey in the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] (1920) and special agreements with smaller eastern European states. Headed by Russian Zionist [[Leo Motzkin]], the ''Comité des Délégations Juives'' was composed of delegations from Palestine, the United States, Canada, Russia, Ukraine, Poland, East Galicia, Romania, Transylvania, Bukovina, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece, and funded mainly by the [[World Zionist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Unity in Dispersion: A History of the World Jewish Congress, World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 26-28.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9780631187288_chunk_g97806311872888_ss1-198|author=Blackwell Reference Online|title=Comité des Délégations Juives}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/ms0361/ |title= A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the first impetus for the creation of the WJC came from the [[American Jewish Congress]]. In December 1917, the AJC adopted a resolution calling for the "convening of a World Jewish Congress", "as soon as peace is declared among the warring nations" in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.22&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, Motzkin visited the United States and addressed the AJC Executive Committee, "pleading for a World Conference of Jews to discuss the conditions of Jews in various lands and to devise ways and means for effective protection of Jewish rights."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.28&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences co-organized by Motzkin and the AJC leaders [[Julian Mack]] and [[Stephen Wise]] took place in 1926 in London and in 1927 in Zurich, Switzerland. The latter was attended by 65 Jews from 13 countries, representing 43 Jewish organizations, though the main Jewish groups in Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, as well as the [[American Jewish Committee]], declined the invitation to attend.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

The First Preparatory World Jewish Conference was held in Geneva in August 1932. A preparatory committee was headed by Zionist [[Nahum Goldmann]], who was one of the leading advocates of the establishment of an international Jewish representative body.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"&gt;Garai, pg. 10 and 20&lt;/ref&gt; Goldmann defined the purpose of the World Jewish Congress as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is to establish the permanent address of the Jewish people; amidst the fragmentation and atomization of Jewish life and of the Jewish community; it is to establish a real, legitimate, collective representation of Jewry which will be entitled to speak in the name of the 16 million Jews to the nations and governments of the world, as well as to the Jews themselves.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The conference approved plans to set up the new organization in 1934, with headquarters in New York and European offices in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1932"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1932/08/18/2795280/geneva-conference-approves-call-for-world-jewish-congress-in-summer-of-1934|author=JTA|title=Geneva Conference Approves Call for World Jewish Congress in Summer of 1934, 18 August 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="americanjewisharchives.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americanjewisharchives.org/aja/FindingAids/ms0361/|title= A Collection Overview to the World Jewish Congress Records. 1918-1982.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a manifesto, delegates called upon the Jewish people to unite as the only effective means of averting danger. The Jews, the declaration said, had to rely on their own power with the assistance of such enlightened sections of the world which had not yet been saturated with poisonous anti-Semitism. It added: "The World Jewish Congress does not aim at weakening any existing organizations, but rather to support and stimulate them."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1932"/&gt; The new organization would be based on the "concept of the Jewish people as a national entity, and authorized and obligated to deal with all problems affecting Jewish life."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1933, following the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]] and his NSDAP in Germany, [[American Jewish Congress]] President Bernard Deutsch called on US Jewish organizations to support the establishment of a World Jewish Congress "to prove the sincerity of their stand" in favor of the embattled Jews of Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1933/07/02/2801209/world-jewish-congress-nearerdeutsch-american-delegates-soon-sail-to-confer|author=JTA|title=World Jewish Congress Nearer—Deutsch; American Delegates Soon Sail to Confer, 2 July 1933}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foundation (1936)===
After two more preparatory conferences in 1933 and 1934, the First Plenary Assembly, held in Geneva in August 1936, established the World Jewish Congress as a permanent and democratic organization. Elections for delegates to that assembly had to be according to democratic principles, namely secret, direct, and based on proportional representation. The 52 American delegates, for instance, were chosen at an Electoral Convention which met in Washington, DC, on 13/14 June 1936 and which was attended by 1,000 representatives from 99 communities in 32 US states.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress's expressed goal was Jewish unity and the strengthening of Jewish political influence in order to assure the survival of the Jewish people, which involved the creation of a Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"/&gt; 230 delegates representing 32 countries gathered for the first WJC assembly. Addressing a press conference in Geneva, [[Stephen S. Wise]] assailed German Jews for opposing the WJC. He said: "I must make clear that the congress is not a parliament nor an attempt at a parliament. It is nothing more than an assembly of representatives of those Jewries which choose to associate themselves in defense of Jewish rights. The congress will not be wholly representative until all Jews choose to be represented by it."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1936/08/09/2835383/world-jewish-congress-set-to-open-tonight-8-point-program-mapped|title=World Jewish Congress Set to Open Tonight; 8 Point Program Mapped|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nahum Goldmann.jpg|thumb|[[Nahum Goldmann]], co-founder and president of the World Jewish Congress from 1949 to 1977]]
Although the delegates elected the US federal judge and erstwhile president of the American Jewish Congress [[Julian Mack]] as honorary president of the WJC, Wise was appointed as chairman of the WJC Executive and thus ''de facto'' leader of the congress. [[Nahum Goldmann]] was named as chair of the Administrative Committee.&lt;ref name="Garai, pg. 10 and 20"/&gt; The new WJC Executive immediately drew up a declaration asking the British government not to halt immigration into Palestine and presented it to British diplomats in Bern, Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1936/08/17/2835437/world-congress-leaders-to-see-british-envoy-on-palestine-today|author=JTA|title=World Congress Leaders to See British Envoy on Palestine Today, 16 August 1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC chose Paris as its headquarters and also opened a liaison office to the [[League of Nations]] in Geneva, first headed by the Swiss international lawyer and WJC Legal Advisor [[Paul Guggenheim]] and later by [[Gerhart Riegner]], who initially served as Guggenheim's secretary.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhart Riegner - Never Despair: Sixty Years in the Service of the Jewish People and of Human Rights, published by Ivan R. Dee, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In its fight against growing anti-Semitism in Europe, the WJC pursued a two-pronged approach: the political and legal sphere (mainly the lobbying of the [[League of Nations]] and public statements) on the one hand, and an attempt to organize a boycott of products from countries such as Nazi Germany on the other. Given the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] vis-à-vis Germany and the successful efforts by the Nazi regime to stave off an economic boycott of German products, both approaches proved not very effective.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.83-110&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the November 1938 pogroms against Jews in Germany called [[Kristallnacht]] in which at least 91 Jews were killed and many synagogues and Jewish shops destroyed, the WJC issued a statement: "Though the Congress deplores the fatal shooting of an official of the German Embassy in Paris by a young Polish Jew of seventeen, it is obliged to protest energetically against the violent attacks in the German press against the whole of Judaism because of this act and, especially, to protest against the reprisals taken against the German Jews after the crime."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roizen.com/ron/grynszpan.htm|first=Ron|last=Roizen |title=Herschel Grynszpan: the Fate of A Forgotten Assassin, Holocaust and Genocide Studies, Vol. 1, No.2., 1986, pp. 217-228}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] in September 1939, the WJC headquarters moved from Paris to Geneva to facilitate communications with Jewish communities in Europe. In the summer of 1940, by which time most of Europe had fallen under [[Nazi]] occupation, the World Jewish Congress's headquarters were moved to New York to share office space with the American Jewish Congress, and a special WJC office was set up in London. The British Section of the WJC was tasked with acting as the European representative of the organization.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p.122-123&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the personnel who worked in the WJC's European offices immigrated to the United States when the WJC moved its headquarters there. At the New York office in the 1940s, the major departments were: Political Department, Institute of Jewish Affairs (research and legal work), Relief and Rescue, Department for Culture and Education (or Culture Department), and Organization Department. In 1940, the WJC opened a representative office in Buenos Aires, Argentina.&lt;ref name="americanjewisharchives.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/article-1G2-2587504540/comit-des-delegations-juives.html|first=Nathan|last=Feinberg|title=Comité des Délégations Juives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WJC efforts during the Holocaust and its aftermath===
The WJC's initial priorities included safeguarding Jewish minority rights, combating anti-Semitism in Europe, and providing emergency relief to Jews fleeing Nazi persecution. The WJC also concentrated on security for Jewish refugees and victims of the war. In 1939, the World Jewish Congress set up a relief committee for Jewish war refugees (RELICO) and cooperated with the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] to protect Jews in Nazi-occupied countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.yadvashem.org/odot_pdf/Microsoft%20Word%20-%205816.pdf|title=Relief Committee for the Warstricken Jewish Population (RELICO)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nahum Goldmann, Stephen Wise, Henri Torres at World Jewish Congress conference in New York, June 1942.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|left|Left to right: [[Nahum Goldmann]], [[Stephen Wise]], and French lawyer [[Henri Torres|Henry Torrès]] (speaking) at a World Jewish Congress conference in New York City, 7 June 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1942/06/08/2857896/immediate-restoration-of-jewish-rights-in-europe-after-allied-victory-demanded|title=Immediate Restoration of Jewish Rights in Europe After Allied Victory Demanded|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Under the auspices of the WJC, 18 committees were set up in the United States composed of exiled representatives of the different European Jewish communities under Nazi rule. The committees were modeled on the governments-in-exile, and their task was to provide moral and material support for Jews in the respective countries, and to prepare a program of Jewish postwar demands. All representative committees together formed the Advisory Council on European Jewish Affairs, which came into being at a conference in New York City in June 1942.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 128-129&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also lobbied Allied governments on behalf of Jewish refugees, and urged US Jewish organizations to work towards waiving immigration quotas for Jewish refugees fleeing Nazi persecution. In 1940, General [[Charles de Gaulle]], the leader of the French government in exile, pledged to the WJC that all measures taken by the [[Vichy regime]] against the Jews would be repudiated upon France's liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1941 and early 1942, Western diplomats and journalists received scattered information about Nazi massacres of many thousands of Jews in German-occupied Poland and Russia. However, the news was difficult to confirm. In June 1942, [[Ignacy Schwarzbart]], one of two Jewish representatives on the Polish National Council of the Polish government-in-exile, held a press conference with WJC officials in London, where it was stated that an estimated one million Jews had already been murdered by the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jtnews.net/index.php?/viewpoints/item/9254/C26 |first=Rafael |last=Medoff |title=How America first learned of the Holocaust|date=2012-06-20|accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Riegner Telegram====
{{Main|Riegner Telegram}}

On 8 August 1942, the WJC's Geneva representative [[Gerhart Riegner]] sent a telegram to the US vice-consul in Geneva in which he informed the Allies for the first time about the Nazis planned [[Final Solution]] to exterminate all Jews in the German-occupied territories.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/filmmore/reference/primary/newsusdept.html U.S. State Department receives information from Switzerland regarding the Nazi plan to murder the Jews of Europe]: The American Experience&lt;/ref&gt; Riegner had received his information from the German industrialist [[Eduard Schulte]].

His telegram read as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Received alarming report about plan being discussed and considered in ''Führer'' headquarters to exterminate at one fell swoop all Jews in German-controlled countries comprising three and a half to four million after deportation and concentration in the east thus solving Jewish question once and for all stop campaign planned for autumn methods being discussed including hydrocyanic acid stop&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference Atlantic City 1944.jpg|thumb|[[Louise Waterman Wise]], Jewish activist and wife of WJC President [[Stephen Samuel Wise|Stephen S. Wise]], addressing the World Jewish Congress War Emergency Conference in Atlantic City, November 1944]]
It was only several weeks later, on 28 August 1942, that WJC President [[Stephen S. Wise]] received Riegner's alarming message.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael Medoff, [http://www.algemeiner.com/2012/06/11/how-america-first-learned-of-the-holocaust "How America First Learnede of the Holocaust"] The Algemeiner (June 11, 2012). Retrieved June 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Riegner Telegram|telegram]] was met with disbelief despite preexisting evidence for mass executions. The US State Department considered it "a wild rumor, fueled by Jewish anxieties", while the British Foreign Office refused to forward the telegram for the time being and called for the allegations to be investigated first. It was only on 25 November 1942 that the WJC was allowed to release the news to the world.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 July 1942, 20,000 people participated in a WJC-organized "Stop Hitler Now" demonstration at New York's Madison Square Garden. Nine months later, on 1 March 1943, an estimated 22,000 people crowded into the same hall and a further 15,000 stood outside at a WJC rally addressed by Wise, [[Chaim Weizmann]], New York Mayor [[Fiorello LaGuardia]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/peopleevents/pandeAMEX101.html |title=The American Experience.America and the Holocaust.People &amp; Events &amp;#124; Rabbi Stephen Wise (1874-1949) |publisher=PBS |date=1942-08-28 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the US government did not heed calls to rescue European Jews. Early in 1944, US Treasury Secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]] stated in front of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that "certain officials in our State Department" had failed while it would have been commanded by duty to "prevent the extermination of the Jews in German-controlled Europe".

====Rescue efforts====
Throughout the war, the WJC lobbied the Allied governments to grant visas to Jewish refugees from Europe and to ensure the restoration of Jewish minority rights in areas liberated by the Allied forces.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the US State Department's opposition, the WJC obtained permission from the [[US Treasury Department]], headed by [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.|Henry Morgenthau]], to transmit funds to Europe for the rescue and assistance of persecuted Jews. According to a report by Riegner, these funds helped to bring 1,350 Jewish children from the occupied countries to Switzerland and 70 to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

However, at the [[Bermuda Conference|Bermuda Refugee Conference]] in 1943, both the United States and Britain refused to relax their immigration policies, not even for British Mandatory Palestine. In reaction, the WJC published a comment which said: "The truth is that what stands in the way of aid to the Jews in Europe by the United Nations is not that such a program is dangerous, but simple lack of will to go to any trouble on their behalf."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Only in January 1944, President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] ordered the setting up of the [[War Refugee Board]], whose purpose was to "rescue victims of enemy oppression who are in imminent danger of death".&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 166&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress also tried - mostly in vain - to convince the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] (ICRC) to assert its authority more forcefully vis-à-vis the Germans, and urged it to secure the status of civilian prisoners of war under the [[Third Geneva Convention]] on prisoners of war for those Jews that were confined to ghettos and Nazi concentration camps, which would have entitled the ICRC to provide care to them. However, the ICRC stuck to the view that it was "in no position to bring pressure to bear upon governments", and that the success of its work "depended on discreet and friendly successions."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 168-169&lt;/ref&gt;

The Holocaust era president of WJC, [[Stephen Wise]], opposed the [[Bergson Group]]'s rescue activism.&lt;ref&gt;The Abandonment of the Jews: America and the Holocaust, 1941-1945 (Pantheon Books, 1984) {{ISBN|978-0-394-42813-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Deafening Silence: American Jewish Leaders and the Holocaust (New York: Shapolsky Publishers, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt; Later president [[Nachum Goldman]] told the State Department (per department protocol) that [[Hillel Kook]] (aka [[Peter Bergson]]) is an adventurer and does not represent "organized Jewry". He pleaded to either deport or draft Hillel Kook in order to stop his activism&lt;ref&gt;A Race Against Death: Peter Bergson, America, and the Holocaust, with David S. Wyman (The New Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Letter to State Department====
[[File:A. Leon Kubowitzki.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|[[Aryeh Leon Kubowitzki]]]]

On 9 August 1944, Leon Kubowitzki (later Aryeh Leon Kubovy), the head of the WJC's Rescue Department, relayed a message from Ernest Frischer of the Czechoslovak State Council to the US State Department urging the destruction of the gas chambers and the bombing of railways lines leading to the [[Auschwitz]] death camp. US Undersecretary of War John J. McCloy rejected the suggestion five days later, writing to Kubowitzki:

&lt;blockquote&gt;After a study it became apparent that such an operation could be executed only by the diversion of considerable air support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations elsewhere and would in any case be of such doubtful efficacy that it would not warrant the use of our resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/holocaust/filmmore/reference/primary/bombworld.html|title=The World Jewish Congress in New York asks the War Department to bomb the crematoria at Auschwitz, August 9, 1944. The War Department turns down the request (August 14, 1944).|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 1944, at the War Emergency Conference held in [[Atlantic City]], USA, the WJC elaborated a program for the post-war period, which included calls for reparations from Germany to Jews and the use of heirless Jewish property for Jewish rehabilitation. Also at that conference, [[Stephen S. Wise]] was elected president of the World Jewish Congress. Delegates decided to embark on a $10,000,000 fund-raising effort for relief and increased political activity throughout the world. The news agency JTA also reported the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The closing session of the conference also adopted a resolution recommending that the Congress establish a Department of Community Service which would be charged with aiding in the reconstruction of the spiritual and cultural life of Jews in liberated countries. Another resolution extended the gratitude of the gathering to the Vatican and to the Governments of Spain, Sweden and Switzerland for the protection they offered under difficult conditions to the persecuted Jews in German-dominated Europe. At the same time, it expressed regret at the fact that 'deplorably little has been done to have Axis civilians under the power of the United Nations exchanged for Jews in ghettos, internment, concentration and labor camps.'&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1944/12/03/2865512/world-jewish-congress-10000000-drive-no-challenge-to-other-groups-leaders-say|World Jewish Congress $10,000,000 Drive No Challenge to Other Groups, Leaders Say], Publisher:JTA, Date: 1944-12-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Meeting of WJC representative with SS leader Heinrich Himmler====
In February 1945, the head of the Swedish office of the WJC, Hilel Storch, established contact through an intermediary with SS chief [[Heinrich Himmler]].&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York, 1948, p. 190-191&lt;/ref&gt; In April, [[Norbert Masur]] of the Swedish Section of the WJC secretly met with Himmler at Harzfeld, around 70 kilometers north of Berlin. Masur had been promised safe conduct by Himmler. Through negotiations with the Nazi leader and the subsequent talks with the head of the Swedish Red Cross, [[Folke Bernadotte]], the WJC was allowed to save 4,500 inmates from the women's concentration camp at Ravensbrück. Approximately half of these women, who had been deported to Germany from over forty countries, were Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Fox, [http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje38/text18p.htm 'A Jew Talks to Himmler'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110174719/http://www.zwoje-scrolls.com/zwoje38/text18p.htm |date=2012-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post-war efforts====
At the end of the war, the WJC undertook efforts to rebuild Jewish communities in Europe, pushed for indemnification and reparation claims against Germany, provided assistance to displaced persons and survivors of the Holocaust, and advocated for the punishment of Nazi leaders for war crimes and crimes against humanity. The World Jewish Congress notably took part in the formulation of the principles governing the [[Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal]] and furnished evidence against Nazi leaders to the US prosecutors.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/nuremberg/documents/index.php?documentdate=1945-06-12&amp;documentid=C106-16-5&amp;studycollectionid=&amp;pagenumber=1y|title=Truman Library: Minutes, Meeting of World Jewish Congress with Robert H.

[[File:1948 World Jewish Congress Montreux - 2.jpg|thumb|Stephen Wise addresses World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly in Montreux, [[Switzerland]], August 1948]]
On 19 August 1945, a conference of representatives of European Jews was organized in Paris, France by the WJC, whose leadership (Wise, Goldmann, Kubowitzki) traveled there from the US. Delegates from Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Sweden and Switzerland attended the gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1945/07/23/2867727/jews-of-western-europe-to-meet-in-paris-delegates-from-seven-countries-expected|title=Jews of Western Europe to Meet in Paris; Delegates from Seven Countries Expected|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 1945, [[Pope Pius XII]] received WJC Secretary General Leon Kubowitzki in audience, who recounted to the pope the "great losses" suffered by the Jews during the war and expressed gratitude for what the church had done to help "our persecuted people." Kubowitzki suggested a papal encyclical on the Catholic Church's attitude toward the Jews and a condemnation of anti-Semitism. "We will consider it," Pius XII reportedly replied, adding: "certainly, most favorably, with all our love." The WJC also urged the Vatican to assist in the recovery of Jewish children saved by Catholics during the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Michael R. Marrus, [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1252/is_1_133/ai_n26741974/pg_2 "The missing: the Holocaust, the Church &amp; Jewish orphans"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also supported the foundation of the [[United Nations]] Organization in 1945. In 1947, the organization became one of the first NGOs to be granted [[consultative status]] with the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/about|title=About Us|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, an estimated 30,000 people attended the opening of the Latin American Conference of the World Jewish Congress at [[Luna Park, Buenos Aires]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1947/06/30/3010696/80000-at-opening-of-latinamerican-parley-of-world-jewish-congress-in-buenos-aires|title=30,000 at Opening of Latin American Parley of World Jewish Congress in Buenos Aires, JTA, 30 June 1947|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WJC and the creation of the State of Israel===
Although its principal purpose was to defend the rights of Jews in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]], the WJC always actively supported the aims of [[Zionism]], i.e. creation of a [[Jewish National Home]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]]. The [[Yishuv]], the Jewish community in British Mandatory Palestine, was represented at the First Plenary Assembly of the WJC in 1936, which affirmed in a resolution "the determination of the Jewish people to live in peaceful cooperation with their Arab neighbors on the basis of mutual respect for the rights of each."&lt;ref&gt;World Jewish Congress, Unity in Dispersion - A History of the World Jewish Congress, New York 1948, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, in a memorandum to the [[Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry]] on Palestine drafted by WJC Political Secretary Alexander L. Easterman, the WJC declared that "the only hope of reviving the life and culture of the Jewish people lies in the establishment of a fully self-governing Jewish Homeland, recognised as such throughout the world; that is, a Jewish Commonwealth in Palestine."&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

WJC officials lobbied UN member states in favor of the adoption of [[UN General Assembly]] Resolution 181 of 1947, which called for the creation of a Jewish and an Arab state in Palestine. On 15 May 1948, the day of Israel's proclamation of independence, the WJC Executive pledged "world Jewry's solidarity" with the fledgling Jewish state. In Montreux, Switzerland, delegates from 34 countries attended the Second Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, held from 27 June to 6 July 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 26-28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiations with Germany on reparations and compensation===
In 1949, the World Jewish Congress called on the newly established [[Federal Republic of Germany]] to acknowledge responsibility and liability of the German people for the wrongs inflicted on the Jewish people by the Nazi regime. In 1950, the WJC opened an office in Frankfurt to function as a "listening post" on developments in Germany. In representations to the United States, Britain and France, the WJC detailed Jewish moral and material claims on Germany. In 1951, [[Nahum Goldmann]], at the request of the Israeli government, established the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany ([[Claims Conference]]).&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The same year, in a declaration approved by the parliament, West German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] recognized Germany's duty to make moral and material restitution to the Jewish people and signaled its readiness to engage in negotiations with Jewish representatives and the State of Israel. "Unspeakable crimes have been committed in the name of the German people, calling for moral and material indemnity [ ... ] The Federal Government are prepared, jointly with representatives of Jewry and the State of Israel [ ... ] to bring about a solution of the material indemnity problem, thus easing the way to the spiritual settlement of infinite suffering," Adenauer said.&lt;ref name="History of the Claims Conference"&gt;[http://www.claimscon.org/?url=history History of the Claims Conference] Retrieved June 21, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 1952, WJC and Claims Conference head [[Nahum Goldmann]] and the West German federal government signed an agreement embodied in two protocols. Protocol No. 1 called for the enactment of laws that would compensate Nazi victims directly for indemnification and restitution claims arising from Nazi persecution. Under Protocol No. 2, the West German government provided the Claims Conference with 450 million deutschmarks for the relief, rehabilitation and resettlement of Jewish victims of Nazi persecution. Similar agreements were also signed with the [[Israel|State of Israel]].

Subsequent to these agreements, the Claims Conference continued to negotiate with the German government for amendments to the various legislative commitments and monitored the implementation of the various compensation and restitution laws. According to the Claims Conference, more than 278,000 Jewish Holocaust survivors received lifetime pensions under the German Federal Indemnification Laws. Germany expended a total of US$60 billion in satisfaction of Jewish claims.&lt;ref name="History of the Claims Conference"/&gt;

In 1952, the World Jewish Congress called on the Austrian government to intensify efforts for the restitution of heirless Jewish property. Austrian Chancellor [[Leopold Figl]] subsequently pledged to remedy Jewish grievances.&lt;ref name="Garai, p. 34"&gt;Garai, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Third Plenary Assembly in Geneva (4 to 11 August 1953), [[Nahum Goldmann]] was elected president of the World Jewish Congress, having previously served as acting president.&lt;ref name="Garai, p. 34"/&gt;

===WJC efforts on behalf of Soviet Jewry===
Although the [[Soviet Union]] initially supported the creation of the [[State of Israel]], during the 1950s the Jewish state emerged as part of the Western camp, and Zionism raised fears of internal dissent and opposition among the Communist leadership.

During the later part of the Cold War, Soviet Jews were suspected of being traitors, Western sympathizers, or security liabilities. The Communist leadership closed down various Jewish organizations and declared Zionism an ideological enemy. Synagogues were often placed under police surveillance, both openly and through the use of informers. As a result of the persecution, both state-sponsored and unofficial, anti-Semitism became deeply ingrained in the society and remained a fact for years. The Soviet media, when depicting political events, sometimes used the term 'fascism' to characterize Israeli nationalism. Jews often suffered hardships, epitomized by often not being allowed to enlist in universities, work in certain professions, or participate in government. Many Jews felt compelled to hide their identities by changing their names.

[[File:World Jewish Congress - Third Plenary Assembly - Geneva 1953.jpg|thumb|Third Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress, Geneva, Switzerland, 4–11 August 1953]]
In 1953, the World Jewish Congress condemned the indictment in Moscow of Jewish doctors as alleged conspirators against the Soviet Union leadership, the so-called [[Doctors' plot]], and called a leadership meeting in Zurich, Switzerland, which was canceled at the last minute due to the death of Soviet dictator [[Joseph Stalin]]. The new Soviet leadership declared that the case against the doctors had been fabricated.&lt;ref&gt;Garai&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, WJC leaders delivered a memorandum to Soviet leaders [[Nikolai Bulganin]] and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during their visit to London, and a year later the World Jewish Congress Executive launched a worldwide call to attention regarding the plight of Jews in the Soviet Union and other Communist countries. This resulted in a growing international campaign for their cultural and religious rights and for the reunion of families separated by the Cold War. After a lapse of seven years, the organization also re-established contact with several Jewish communities in Communist Eastern Europe. In 1957, the Jewish community of Hungary re-affiliated with the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1960, the WJC convoked the International Conference on Soviet Jewry in Paris, which was chaired by Goldmann. In 1971, the WJC co-sponsored the First World Conference of Jewish Communities on Soviet Jewry in Brussels, Belgium. Successor events were held in Brussels and Zurich in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Garai, pp. 36-52&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second Brussels conference, Jewish leaders called on the Soviet Union to implement the [[Declaration of Helsinki]] on human rights, respect its own constitution and laws and "recognize and respect the right of Jews in the USSR to be united with their brethren in the Land of Israel, the Jewish historic homeland."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1976/02/20/2974589/brussels-ii-ends-with-call-on-ussr-to-implement-helsinki-declaration-recognize-rights-of-jews-to-be-reunited-with-brethren-in-israel|title=Brussels II Ends with Call on USSR to Implement Helsinki Declaration, Recognize Rights of Jews to Be, JTA, 20 February 1976|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the motto, 'Let my people go!, the Soviet Jewry movement caught the attention of statesmen and public figures throughout the West, who considered the Soviet Union's policy toward Jews to be in violation of basic human and civil rights such as freedom of immigration, freedom of religion, and the freedom to study one's own language, culture and heritage. "You have no choice but to release Soviet Jewry," US President [[Ronald Reagan]] told Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] during the latter's first state visit to the US in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sovietjewry.org/history.php |title=Soviet Jewry Movement Marks Anniversaries |publisher=Sovietjewry.org |date=2007-10-30 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Edgar Bronfman suggested that "American Jews should abandon their strongest weapon, the Jackson–Vanik amendment, as a sign of goodwill that challenges the Soviets to respond in kind."

After [Mikhail Gorbachev]'s ascension in 1985, Bronfman's New York Times message began to resonate with the public. In early 1985, Bronfman secured an invitation to the Kremlin and on September 8–11, visited Moscow, becoming the first World Jewish Congress President to be formally received in Moscow by Soviet Officials. Carrying a note from Shimon Peres, Bronfman met with Gorbachev, and initiated talks of a Soviet Jewish airlift. It is said that Peres' note called on the Soviet Union to resume diplomatic relations with Israel.

In a Washington Post profile a few months after the September trip, Bronfman laid out what he thought had been accomplished during his September meetings. He said, "There's going to be a buildup of pressure through the business community. The Russians know the Soviet Jewry issue is tied to trade ... My guess is that over a period of time, five to ten years, some of our goals will be achieved." Author Gal Beckerman says in his When They Come For Us We'll Be Gone, "Bronfman had a business man's understanding of the Soviet Jewish issue. It was all a matter of negotiation, of calculating what the Russians really wanted and leveraging that against emigration."

On 25 March 1987, WJC leaders [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar M. Bronfman]], [[Israel Singer]], [[Sol Kanee]] and Elan Steinberg, as well as the head of the [[Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations]], [[Morris B. Abram]], arrived in Moscow to discuss the matter with Soviet government ministers, though officials swiftly denied that the USSR had agreed to an increase in Jewish emigration and had invited an Israeli delegation to visit Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1987-04-03/news/mn-2416_1_emigration|title=Moscow Denies Shift on Jews or Israel Policy|first=From Times Wire|last=Services|date=3 April 1987|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the visits by WJC officials to Moscow were widely seen as helpful in securing the exit permits for prominent Jews in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name="jewishpost.com"&gt;Gad Nahson, [http://www.jewishpost.com/archives/news/edgar-m-bronfman-the-making-of-a-jew.html EDGAR M. BRONFMAN "THE MAKING OF A JEW"], Jewish Post, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Soviet Jewish organizations were granted permission by the authorities to join the World Jewish Congress,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/04/world/soviet-jews-to-join-world-congress.html "Soviet Jews to Join World Congress"], New York Times, 4 January 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and two years later in Jerusalem, several directly elected delegates from the Soviet Union were officially represented for the first time at a World Jewish Congress Plenary Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1991/05/07/2874728/soviet-jews-fill-empty-chair-at-wjc-assembly-in-jerusalem "Soviet Jews Fill ‘empty Chair’ at Wjc Assembly in Jerusalem"], JTA, 7 May 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===Securing the rights of Jews in North Africa and the Middle East===
In the aftermath of World War II and the establishment of the State of Israel, the World Jewish Congress was actively involved in assisting Jews in Arab and other Muslim countries, who had come under increasing pressure. In January 1948, WJC President Stephen Wise, appealed to US Secretary of State George Marshall: "Between 800,000 and a million Jews in the Middle East and North Africa, exclusive of Palestine, are in 'the greatest danger of destruction' at the hands of Muslims being incited to holy war over the Partition of Palestine ... Acts of violence already perpetrated, together with those contemplated, being clearly aimed at the total destruction of the Jews, constitute genocide, which under the resolutions of the General Assembly is a crime against humanity." The United States, however, did not take any follow-up action to investigate these pleadings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/jewref.html|title=Jewish Virtual Library-Jewish Refugees from Arab Countries|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Jewish Congress North African Conference, Algiers, June 1952.jpg|thumb|left|World Jewish Congress conference on the situation of Jews in North Africa, Algiers, 1952]]The WJC also submitted a memorandum on the problem to the UN Economic and Social Council, asking for urgent action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zionism-israel.com/hdoc/Arab_League_Law_Jews.htm|title=Draft Arab League Law Regarding Jews-1947|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum in particular mentioned an [[Arab League]] document which planned to strip Jewish citizens of their rights and belongings as part of a calculated plan. However, when the WJC brought the Arab League document before the ECOSOC, its president Charles H. Malik, a representative of Lebanon to the UN, refused to bring it to the floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishpolicycenter.org/112/the-forgotten-jewish-refugees-from-arab-states|title=Robert Ivker, The Forgotten Jewish Refugees From Arab States, 2008|accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1950s, the WJC conducted negotiations with a number of Arab governments, notably in North Africa, and pleaded with them to allow their Jewish populations to leave their native countries. With the advance of Arab nationalism, especially during the 1950s, these efforts were increasingly complicated. In 1954, a WJC delegation visited Morocco, then still under French colonial rule.

The WJC leadership also kept in close touch with the leaders of the Moroccan independence movement, including the exiled sultan of Morocco, Mohammed V, who insisted that an autonomous Morocco would guarantee the freedom and equality of all its citizens, including access of non-Muslims to public administration.&lt;ref&gt;Jews in the new North African states, Report submitted to the Fourth Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress by the directors of the Political and International Affairs Departments, A. L. Easterman and Dr. M.L. Perlzweig, in: World Jewry, 1959, p.12-13 and p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; When Morocco became independent from France in 1956, WJC Political Director Alex Easterman immediately began negotiations with Prime Minister [[Mbarek Bekkay]] and other government officials, pressing them to grant Jews the right to leave.

Whilst in 1957 an agreement was reached to allow for the emigration of all 8,000 Jews from Mazagan that were held in a refugee camp near [[Casablanca]],&lt;ref name="Gerhart M. Riegner 1961, p. 19"&gt;Gerhart M. Riegner, Jews in North Africa, in: World Jewry, 1961, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; a 1959 WJC report concluded that in spite of repeated assurances by the new government that Jewish rights would be safeguarded, "internal political conflicts have obstructed a solution" to the problem that Moroccan Jews willing to leave the country were denied passports by the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Jews in the new North African states, Report submitted to the Fourth Plenary Assembly of the World Jewish Congress by the directors of the Political and International Affairs Departments, A.

Riegner 1961, p. 19"/&gt; However, both King [[Mohammed V of Morocco|Mohammed V]] and his successor, [[Hassan II]] of Morocco continued to emphasize that Jews enjoyed equal rights in their country.&lt;ref name="Gerhart M. Riegner 1961, p. 19"/&gt;

===1950s-1980s===
Delegates from 43 countries attended the Fourth WJC Plenary Assembly held in Stockholm in 1959.

In 1960, the WJC convoked a special conference in Brussels following a series of anti-Semitic incidents in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966, the speaker of the West German parliament, [[Eugen Gerstenmaier]], delivered an address titled, 'Germans and Jews – A Problem Unresolved' to the Fifth Plenary Assembly in Brussels, Belgium, becoming the first senior German politician to address a WJC conference, which caused some controversy within the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1499&amp;dat=19660802&amp;id=cNsjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1ycEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3126,329372|title=Milwaukee Journal, 2 August 1966, p.3|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some delegates from Israel boycotted the session with Gerstenmaier in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1966/08/02/3085139/mapam-and-her-ut-to-boycott-wjc-symposium-on-germans-and-jews|title=Mapam and Herut to Boycott WJC Symposium on ‘Germans and Jews’ - JTA, 2 August 1966|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1963, the American Section of the WJC was set up to broaden the organization's constituency in the country with the biggest Jewish community worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] affiliated with the World Jewish Congress. The British Section of the WJC, which had previously represented UK Jewry, was dissolved.

To emphasize its solidarity with the State of Israel, the WJC held its Sixth Plenary Assembly in 1975 for the first time in Jerusalem, and with one exception, all plenary assemblies have since been held there. The delegates also adopted new statutes and a new structure for the organization, and the WJC entered into a cooperation agreement with the [[World Zionist Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;Congress in Action – Chronicle of forty years, in: George Garai (ed.), World Jewish Congress, 40 Years in Action 1936-1976, p. 56-58&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opposition to UN resolution condemning Zionism as racism====
The World Jewish Congress was vocal in efforts to repeal [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379]], which was adopted on November 10, 1975 and held "that Zionism is a form of racism and racial discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;''Moynihan's Moment: America's Fight Against Zionism as Racism'', Gil Troy, Oxford University Press, 2012, {{ISBN|978-0-19-992030-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC Executive characterized the resolution as an "attempt to defame Zionism by equating it with imperialism, colonialism, racism, and apartheid, […] amounting to incitement to racism and racial hatred." All communities and organizations affiliated to the Congress were urged to take immediate action to mobilize public opinion against the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Activities of the World Jewish Congress, February 1975-October 1977, Report of the Secretary-General to the General Council of the World Jewish Congress at its meeting in Washington, October 30 – November 3, 1977, Geneva, October 1977, p.6&lt;/ref&gt; Israel made revocation of Resolution 3379 a condition of its participation in the [[Madrid Conference of 1991|Madrid Peace Conference]] of 1991. Resolution 3379 was revoked in 1991 by UN General Assembly Resolution 4686.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the WJC also campaigned for an end to the [[Arab boycott of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/10/14/2973350/wjc-committee-on-arab-boycott-will-focus-on-international-pacts "WJC Committee on Arab Boycott Will Focus on International Pacts"], JTA, 14 October 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

====Leadership changes====
At the WJC Plenary in 1975, longtime WJC leader [[Nahum Goldmann]] (then 80) stood again for WJC president. Several Israeli delegates, notably from the [[Herut]] movement, but also former Israeli Prime Minister [[Golda Meir]], opposed Goldmann's re-election for his criticism of Israel's policies, notably with respect to the peace process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/01/08/2970955/herut-seeking-to-prevent-reelection-of-goldmann-as-wjc-president|title=Herut Seeking to Prevent Re-election of Goldmann As WJC President - JTA, 8 January 1975|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1975/02/10/2970825/goldmann-reelected-wjc-president-despite-bitter-herut-opposition|title=Goldmann Re-elected Wjc President Despite Bitter Herut Opposition - JTA, 10 February 1975|publisher=}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seated on the right: Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]]]]Two years later, in 1977, the American real estate developer and erstwhile president of [[B'nai B'rith]] International [[Philip Klutznick]] succeeded Goldmann as WJC president. In 1979, when Klutznick was named US secretary of commerce by President [[Jimmy Carter]], the Canadian-American businessman [[Edgar Bronfman Sr.]] took over as acting head of the organization. Bronfman was formally elected WJC president by the Seventh Plenary Assembly, held in Jerusalem in January 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1981/02/01/world/bronfman-heads-jewish-congress.html?scp=2&amp;sq=edgar+bronfman&amp;st=nyt "Bronfman Heads Jewish Congress"], New York Times, 1 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Edgar M. Bronfman=====
Under the leadership of Bronfman, the new Secretary General [[Israel Singer]] (who took over from [[Gerhart Riegner]] in 1983), and Executive Director Elan Steinberg, the WJC adopted a more aggressive style. Steinberg characterized the change as follows: "For a long time, the World Jewish Congress was meant to be the greatest secret of Jewish life, because the nature of diplomacy after the war was quiet diplomacy. This is a newer, American-style leadership — less timid, more forceful, unashamedly Jewish."&lt;ref name="jewishpost.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishledger.com/2012/04/elan-steinberg-advocated-for-holocaust-survivors-around-the-world "Elan Steinberg advocated for Holocaust survivors around the world"], Jewish Ledger, 10 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  
Bronfman led the World Jewish Congress in becoming the preeminent Jewish organization, as they broadened the organization's base by bringing in new member communities in Europe. Through campaigns to free Soviet Jewry, the exposure of the Nazi past of Austrian President Kurt Waldheim, and the campaign to compensate victims of the Holocaust, Bronfman became well known internationally in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jewish Philanthropist Edgar Bronfman Passes Away at 84 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Edgar-Bronfman-passes-away-at-84-335767 |accessdate=April 29, 2014|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=December 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 June 1982, WJC President Edgar Bronfman became the first leader ever of a Jewish organization to address the United Nations General Assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.jta.org/article/1982/05/24/2993642/wjc-to-be-the-only-jewish-ngo-to-address-un-assemblys-special-session-on-disarmament "WJC to Be the Only Jewish NGO to Address UN Assembly’s Special Session on Disarmament"], JTA, 24 May 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

====Controversy over Catholic convent's presence at Auschwitz====
In 1985, [[Carmelites|Carmelite nuns]] opened a convent near the site of the former Nazi death camp [[Auschwitz]] I. WJC President Edgar Bronfman called for the removal of the convent. In public statements, other Jewish leaders, including former WJC Secretary General [[Gerhart Riegner]], also called for the removal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1986/01/13/3003376/plan-to-build-convent-on-site-of-auschwitz-death-camp-sparks-anger-among-european-jewish-communities|title=Plan to Build Convent on Site of Auschwitz Death Camp Sparks Anger Among European Jewish Communities|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, the Catholic Church agreed to those requests and said the convent would be removed within two years.

However, the Carmelites stayed put, and a year later erected a large cross from a 1979 mass with the Pope near their site. The World Jewish Congress Executive strongly urged the Vatican to take action against the convent's presence and said [[Pope John Paul II]] should "exercise his authority" to order the prompt removal of convent and cross. The WJC Executive said the pontiff's action was necessary to implement the agreement major European Catholic cardinals, including the cardinal of Kraków, Franciszek Macharski, had signed with Jewish leaders on 22 February 1987 in Geneva. Edgar Bronfman declared: "It is not only a matter of the Auschwitz convent, but the broader implications of historical revisionism in which the uniqueness of the Holocaust and the murder of the Jewish people is being suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1989/05/11/2870284/wjc-urges-pope-to-use-authority-to-remove-convent-from-auschwitz|title=Wjc Urges Pope to Use Authority to Remove Convent from Auschwitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months later, the Carmelites were ordered by Rome to move. The WJC praised the Vatican for taking action,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1989/09/20/2871143/vatican-praised-for-offer-to-help-relocate-the-convent-at-auschwitz|title=Vatican Praised for Offer to Help Relocate the Convent at Auschwitz|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the nuns remained on the site until 1993, leaving the large cross behind.

====Diplomatic contacts with Communist countries====
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1988-1017-018, Berlin, Bronfman-Besuch.jpg|thumb|left|Meeting of a WJC delegation led by Edgar Bronfman with GDR leader [[Erich Honecker]], in East Berlin, October 1988]]

During the mid-1980s, the World Jewish Congress also entered into diplomatic talks with several Central and Eastern European countries, notably Communist East Germany, whose leadership the WJC urged to recognize its obligations to Jewish victims of Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/27-5-16.shtml "THE GDR OFFERS "SYMBOLIC" COMPENSATION TO JEWISH VICTIMS OF NAZISM"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160310095417/http://osaarchivum.org/files/holdings/300/8/3/text/27-5-16.shtml |date=2016-03-10 }}, Radio Free Europe, 20 October 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1990, GDR Prime Minister [[Hans Modrow]] sent a letter to WJC President Edgar Bronfman in which he recognized on behalf of the East German government the GDR's responsibility for German crimes committed against the Jewish people under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;Holocauste: L'Est avoue - Libération, 9 February 1990, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In a statement, Modrow said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The German Democratic Republic stands unalterably by its duty to do everything against racism, Nazism, anti-Semitism, and hatred among peoples, so that, in the future, war and fascism will never again start from German soil, but only peace and understanding among people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1990_682891/e-germany-agrees-to-pay-reparations-for-crimes-aga.html|title=E.

A few weeks later, the first freely elected parliament of the GDR, the ''[[Volkskammer]]'', passed a resolution which recognized the GDR's responsibility for the Holocaust and asked "Jews around the world for forgiveness". The GDR pledged to compensate for material damages to Jews and to safeguard Jewish traditions. The resolution became part of the [[German reunification]] treaty and continues to be part of German law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compass-infodienst.de/Konrad_Weiss__Antisemitismus_und_Israelfeindschaft_in_der_DDR.1452.0.html#referenz_15|title=04.12.2017 - Nr. 1756|website=www.compass-infodienst.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the World Jewish Congress held a meeting of its Executive Committee in Budapest, Hungary, the first WJC gathering in Communist Eastern Europe since the end of World War II. The Hungarian government had accepted that there would to be no restrictions to the attendance of Israeli delegates or the subjects of discussion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/05/07/world/a-jewish-parley-in-budapest.html "A JEWISH PARLEY IN BUDAPEST"], New York Times, 7 May 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

====Waldheim affair====
In 1986, the World Jewish Congress alleged that Austrian presidential candidate [[Kurt Waldheim]], a former secretary general of the [[United Nations]], had lied about his service as an officer in the mounted corps of the Nazi Party "[[Sturmabteilung]]" (SA), and his time as German ordnance officer in Thessaloniki, Greece, from 1942 to 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/files-show-kurt-waldheim-served-under-war-criminal.html?scp=1&amp;sq=waldheim+nazi+world+jewish+congress&amp;st=nyt |title=FILES SHOW KURT WALDHEIM SERVED UNDER WAR CRIMINAL |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date=4 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waldheim called the allegations "pure lies and malicious acts". In a telex to Bronfman, he said that his past had been "deliberately misinterpreted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/world/waldheim-says-reports-on-past-are-unfounded.html?scp=5&amp;sq=waldheim+nazi+world+jewish+congress&amp;st=nyt |title=WALDHEIM SAYS HIS PAST WAS MISREPRESENTED |newspaper= [[New York Times]] |date=6 March 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: "Yes, I knew. I was horrified. But what could I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed." He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had "remained confined to a desk".

Former Austrian Jewish chancellor [[Bruno Kreisky]] called the World Jewish Congress's actions an "extraordinary infamy" adding that in election, Austrians "won't allow the Jews abroad to order us about and tell us who should be our President."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/04/world/around-the-world-ex-chancellor-voices-criticism-of-waldheim.html "EX-CHANCELLOR VOICES CRITICISM OF WALDHEIM"], [[New York Times]], 4 April 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the ongoing international controversy, the Austrian government decided to appoint an international committee of historians to examine Waldheim's life between 1938 and 1945. Their report found no evidence of any personal involvement of Waldheim in those crimes. At the same time, although he had stated that he was unaware of any crimes taking place, the historians cited evidence that Waldheim must have known about war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Wiesenthal "The Waldheim Case" in ''Contemporary Jewish Writing in Austria'' edited by Dagmar Lorenz. pp 81-95, University of Nebraska press&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his term as president (1986–1992), Waldheim and his wife Elisabeth were officially deemed "[[personae non gratae]]" by the United States. They could visit only Arab countries and the [[Vatican City]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2351006420070623?pageNumber=2 "Waldheim, ex-UN leader and Nazi, buried in Austria"] Reuters, 23 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2007/jun2007/wald-j21.shtml|title=Kurt Waldheim (1918-2007)|first=Dietmar|last=Henning|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, they were put on a watch list of persons banned from entering the United States and remained on the list even after the publication of the International Committee of Historians' report on his military past in the [[Wehrmacht]].

On May 5, 1987, Bronfman spoke to the World Jewish Congress saying Waldheim was "part and parcel of the Nazi killing machine". Waldheim subsequently filed a lawsuit against Bronfman, but dropped the suit shortly after due to a lack of evidence in his favor.

===Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments===
In 1992, the World Jewish Congress established the World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO), an umbrella body of Jewish organizations and including the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]]. Its purpose is to pursue the restitution of Jewish property in Europe, outside Germany (which is dealt with by the [[Claims Conference]]). According to its website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Mission/Default.aspx|title=World Jewish Restitution Organization – Our Mission|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610231419/http://wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Mission/Default.aspx|archive-date=2012-06-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the WRJO's mission is to consult and negotiate "with national and local governments to conclude agreements and ensure legislation concerning the restitution of property to the Jewish people", to conduct "research on Jewish property in national and local archives and to establish a central data bank in which information on Jewish communal property will be recorded and assembled, and to allocate "funds for the preservation of Jewish cultural and educational projects in that country. To date, such funds have been establishes in Poland, Romania and Hungary." Current World Jewish Congress President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] is chairman of the WRJO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Council/Default.aspx|title=World Jewish Restitution Organization – Council Representatives|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630164329/http://wjro.org.il/Web/AboutUs/Council/Default.aspx|archive-date=2012-06-30|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Swiss bank settlement====
{{See also|World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss banks|Bergier Commission}}
In the late 1990s, as President of the WJC, Edgar Bronfman championed the cause of restitution from Switzerland for Holocaust survivors. Bronfman began an initiative that led to the $1.25 billion settlement from Swiss banks, aiming to resolve claims "that the Swiss hoarded bank accounts opened by Jews who were murdered by the Nazis".

In total, the WJC, the [[Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany]], the World Jewish Restitution Organization, and the [[International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims]], founded in 1998, have secured millions of dollars for the victims and survivors of the Holocaust in payments from Germany, [[World Jewish Congress lawsuit against Swiss Banks|Swiss banks]], Insurances and other parties totaling $20 billion.&lt;ref name=buncombe&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=597158 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050305083349/http://news.independent.co.uk/world/americas/story.jsp?story=597158 |date=March 5, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/838311.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edgar M Bronfman 1989.jpg|thumb|[[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.|Edgar M. Bronfman]]]]
In 1995, the WJC initiated negotiations on behalf of various Jewish organizations with Swiss banks and the government of [[Switzerland]] over so-called dormant [[World War II]]-era bank accounts of [[Holocaust]] victims. The WJC entered a [[class-action lawsuit]] in Brooklyn, NY alleging that Holocaust victims and their families faced improper barriers to accessing WWII-era Swiss bank accounts because of requirements such as death certificates (typically non-existent for Holocaust victims), and that some Swiss banks made deliberate efforts to retain the account balances indefinitely. The claims also included the value of art works purported to have been stolen, "damages" to persons denied admission to Switzerland on the strength of refugee applications, and the value or cost of labor purported to have been performed by persons being maintained at Swiss government expense in displaced-person camps during the Holocaust, along with interest on such claims from the time of loss. The WJC marshaled the support of US government officials including New York Senator Alfonse D'Amato, who held hearings of the Senate Banking Committee on the topic and claimed that "hundreds of millions of dollars" of WWII-era Jewish assets remained in Swiss banks. At the behest of US President [[Bill Clinton]], Undersecretary of Commerce [[Stuart Eizenstat]] testified at these hearings that Swiss banks knowingly purchased looted gold from the Nazis during WWII. Eizenstat was later named special envoy of the US government for Holocaust issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banking.senate.gov/97_05hrg/051597/witness/eizenst.htm Hearings before the US Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301040526/http://banking.senate.gov/97_05hrg/051597/witness/eizenst.htm |date=2007-03-01 }}, May 15, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The report relied exclusively on US government archives. It contained no new historical information on Nazi victims' deposits into Swiss banks, and criticized the decisions of US officials who negotiated settlements with Switzerland after the war as being too lenient.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart E. Eizenstat, Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade, Special Envoy of the Department of State on Property Restitution in Central and Eastern Europe,[http://www.ushmm.org/assets/state/index.html "U.S. and Allied Efforts To Recover and Restore Gold and Other Assets Stolen or Hidden by Germany During World War II"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101094622/http://www.ushmm.org/assets/state/index.html |date=2007-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html|title=A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Audits ordered by the Swiss government of dormant accounts between 1962 and 1995 showed a total of US $32 million (in 1995 terms) in unclaimed war-era accounts. However, during the negotiations, the Swiss banks agreed to commission another audit of wartime accounts, headed by former US [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Paul Volcker]]. The Volcker Commission report concluded that the 1999 book value of all dormant accounts possibly belonging to victims of Nazi persecution that were unclaimed, closed by the Nazis or closed by unknown persons was CHF 95 million. Of this total, CHF 24 million were "probably" related to victims of Nazi persecution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crt-ii.org/ICEP/ICEP_Report_ToC.pdf "Report on Dormant Accounts of Victims of Nazi Persecution in Swiss Banks"], Annex 4; and Part I paragraph 41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html|title="A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission recommended that for settlement purposes, the book values should be modified back to 1945 values (by adding back fees paid and subtracting interest) and then be multiplied by 10 to reflect average long-term investment rates in Switzerland.
On 12 August 1998, several major Swiss banks agreed to pay Holocaust survivors and their relatives more than US$1.25 billion over the following three years. As part of the settlement, the plaintiffs agreed to drop a lawsuit against the Government-owned Swiss National Bank in US courts.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

====Nazi gold====
In 1997, a study commissioned by the World Jewish Congress concluded that Nazi Germany had looted at least US $8.5 billion in gold between 1933 and 1945 from Jews and other victims. The study estimated that a third of the gold had come from individuals and private businesses rather than central banks and that over US $2 billion of privately owned gold eventually ended up in Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/07/world/a-price-tag-of-billions-in-nazi-gold.html|title=A Price Tag Of Billions In Nazi Gold|first=David E.|last=Sanger|date=7 October 1997|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland rejected the WJC accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/10/08/world/world-news-briefs-swiss-reject-finding-of-3-billion-gold-debt.html?scp=10&amp;sq=world+jewish+congress+nazi+gold&amp;st=nyt "Swiss Reject Finding Of $3 Billion Gold Debt"], [[New York Times]], 8 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In response to inquiries from the World Jewish Congress, the US [[Federal Reserve Bank]] admitted in 1997 that personal gold seized by the Nazis was melted into gold bars after the war and then shipped as gold bullion to the central banks of four European countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/7177/u-s-admits-to-melting-gold-of-nazi-victims "U.S. admits to melting gold of Nazi victims"], New York Jewish Week, 5 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Sweden also opened an investigation into assertions by the World Jewish Congress that looted Nazi gold from World War II had been deposited in Swedish government bank vaults.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/21/world/sweden-to-investigate-assertions-of-nazi-gold.html?scp=1&amp;sq=world+jewish+congress+nazi+gold&amp;st=nyt "Sweden to Investigate Assertions of Nazi Gold"], [[New York Times]], 21 December 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

====Agreements with other European countries on Holocaust-era property restitution and compensation====
During the 1990s and 2000s, at the behest of the World Jewish Congress a total of 17 European countries established special committees to look into their role during [[World War II]]. Many set up funds to compensate Jewish and other victims of the war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/video/17/70_25_wjc_anniversary_video WJC anniversary video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120825093042/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/video/17/70_25_wjc_anniversary_video |date=2012-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, French Prime Minister [[Alain Juppé]] created a commission to investigate the seizures of Jewish property by the occupying Nazi forces and the French collaborators during the war.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/nazis/etc/cron.html "A Chronology of Events Surrounding the Lost Assets of Victims of Nazi Germany"] PBS Frontline&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000/2001, the World Jewish Congress helped to negotiate a compensation agreement with the German government and industry under which a €5 billion fund was set up to compensate World War II slave and forced laborers, mainly living Central and Eastern Europe, who had hitherto not received any compensation payments for the suffering under Nazi rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,135530,00.html "NS-Zwangsarbeiter: Erste Zahlungen ab Juni"], Spiegel Online, 23 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restitution of looted art====
In 1998, the WJC released a list of 2,000 people who allegedly took part in the Nazis' massive looting of art. It named people from 11 countries, including museum curators, gallery owners, art experts and other intermediaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-10/world/9811_10_nazi.art_1_nazi-art-french-museums-jewish-collections?_s=PM:WORLD "France publishes catalogue of looted Nazi art"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100919114417/http://articles.cnn.com/1998-11-10/world/9811_10_nazi.art_1_nazi-art-french-museums-jewish-collections?_s=PM:WORLD |date=2010-09-19 }}, [[CNN]], 10 November 1998&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later, in Washington DC, delegates from 44 countries agreed to set up a central registry on art looted by the Nazis which could be established on the internet.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2000/STYLE/arts/03/02/holocaust.art.reut "Manhattan museum plans to issue Holocaust looted-art study"], [[CNN]], 2 March 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald S. Lauder]], then chairman of the WJC Art Recovery Commission, estimated that 110,000 pieces of art worth between US $10 and 30 billion were still missing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/227675.stm "Europe Nazi loot to return to Holocaust victims"], [[BBC News]], 4 December 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the World Jewish Congress criticized museums for waiting for artworks to be claimed by Holocaust victims instead of publicly announcing that they have suspect items.&lt;ref name="archives.cnn.com"/&gt; In the wake of the WJC accusations, a number of countries commissioned investigations into Nazi-looted art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1060451.stm "Canada probes Nazi loot"], [[BBC News]], 8 December 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Poland===
The WJC has evinced a great interest in Poland, both before the war, when the country was home to some 3.25 million Jews (10 percent of that country's total population, forming the largest Jewish community in Europe); and in the post-war period, when the Jewish community was reconstituted. In second half of the 1930s, in the face of a marked rise in antisemitism, the WJC attempted to intervene on behalf of [[Polish Jewry]]. In December 1936, for example, [[Nahum Goldmann]] visited Poland and conferred with the Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Jozef Beck]], but this ''demarche'' did little to abate the situation. In order to counter the drastic affects of the ban on kosher slaughter ([[Shechita]]), the WJC Economic Department prepared a study on the legislation and proposed various relief measures that could be instituted.&lt;ref&gt;Unity in Dispersion, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC also intervened to ensure that Polish Jews deported from Germany at the end of October 1938 and stranded in Zbaszyn would be allowed to resettle elsewhere in Poland.

After the war, when a wave of [[Anti-Jewish violence in Poland, 1944–1946|anti-Jewish violence swept the country]], the WJC prevailed upon the Polish government to remove all obstacles faced by Jews who sought to leave the country and for the most part Jews were able to emigrate unhindered until about 1950. Most left without visas or exit permits thanks to a decree of [[Marian Spychalski|Gen. Spychalski]].&lt;ref name="D-H"&gt;Devorah Hakohen, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hCw6v0TFhdMC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=%22Poland+opened+its+gates+to+Jewish+emigration.%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=vZPlTILoE8uUnAey5NGjDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Poland%20opened%20its%20gates%20to%20Jewish%20emigration.%22&amp;f=false  ''Immigrants in turmoil: mass immigration to Israel and its repercussions...''] Syracuse University Press, 2003 - 325 pages.

[[File:2008 World Jewish Congress Delegation meets with Polish PM Donald Tusk.jpg|thumb|left|A World Jewish Congress delegation meets with Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]], June 2008]]As the Jewish community dwindled, over successive waves of emigration (the last in 1968), the WJC saw Poland as an important repository of Jewish history as well as the custodians of the killing grounds in which much of European Jewry fell victim to the German Final Solution.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Weinbaum, The Jewish communities in the diaspora and antisemitism in Poland Moreshet: Journal for the Study of the Holocaust and Antisemitism. VI, Spring 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, the Polish government and the WJC worked to have Auschwitz placed on the UNESCO World Heritage list as site of genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz: Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; The organization repeatedly pressed Poland to ensure that in Auschwitz and other Nazi German death camp sites, the memory of the Jews who had been the main victims, would not be subsumed in collective memory. As such, at the end of the 1980s, the organization was deeply involved in the struggle to have the Carmelite convent that had been established on its ground removed. Rabbi [[David Rosen (rabbi)|David Rosen]] of the Anti-Defamation League noted at the time: "To some extent the WJC did determine the tune. Their style created the atmosphere in which no public Jewish organization could not get involved. Had the WJC not got involved, those issues might not have developed in the way they did."&lt;ref&gt;Emma Klein, The Battle for Auschwitz:P Catholic-Jewish Relations Under Strain (London, Vallentine Mitchell, 2001), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC has consistently lobbied the Polish government to enact legislation that would ensure the restitution of private property seized during the Nazi occupation and later during the Communist regime. In April 1996, during a discussion about the restitution of Jewish communal property that had been seized during the Holocaust, WJC Secretary General [[Israel Singer]], allegedly stated that "More than three million Jews died in Poland, and the Polish people are not going to be the heirs of the Polish Jews. We are never going to allow this. ( ... ) They're gonna hear from us until Poland freezes over again." If Poland did not satisfy Jewish claims it would be "publicly attacked and humiliated" in the international forum, Singer said according to a Reuters report.&lt;ref&gt;Jewish group threatens Poland over restitution, Reuters, 19 April 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, President Lauder declared that by prevaricating on the restitution issue Poland was "telling many elderly prewar landowners, including Holocaust survivors, that they have no foreseeable hope of even a small measure of justice for the assets that were seized from them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/news/27993 |title=EJP &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Jewish leader discusses restitution of stolen property with Polish PM |publisher=Ejpress.org |date=2008-06-18 |accessdate=2013-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In pursuit of a more nuanced approach to the history of Polish-Jewish relations that includes Jewish recognition of Polish losses suffered during World War II, the WJC's Research Institute published two monographs which explored the attempts to revive [[Polish Jewry]] and the ways in which Poles and Jews have confronted their common history.&lt;ref&gt;Policy Study No. 14 "Polish Jews: A Postscript to the 'Final Chapter'?" (Jerusalem, 1998) and Policy Study No. 22 "The Struggle for Memory in Poland: Auschwitz, Jedwabne and Beyond" (Jerusalem, 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Israel Council on Foreign Relations, which operates under the auspices of the World Jewish Congress, together with the Polish Institute for International Affairs, held two successive conferences (one in Warsaw in 2009 and the other in Jerusalem in 2010) to discuss bilateral relations and international issues of mutual concern. At the second gathering the 20th anniversary of the re-establishment of relations between the two countries was marked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Thoughts-on-May-3.|title=Patrycja Sasnal (editor), "Polish-Israeli Foreign Policy Conference: Twenty Years of Bilateral Relations, Jerusalem, 19-20 September, 2010 - Post Conference Reports" PISM (November 2010); Laurence Weinbaum, Thoughts on May 3 - Jerusalem Post, 2 May 2009. |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key policies and activities of the World Jewish Congress==
===Support for Israel===
[[File:Tony Blair - Jerusalem - June 2011.jpg|thumb|left|International Quartet for the Middle East envoy [[Tony Blair]] briefs delegates at the World Jewish Congress Governing Board in Jerusalem on the peace process, June 2011]]
The mission statement of the World Jewish Congress says that the organization seeks "to enhance solidarity among Jewish communities throughout the world and, recognizing the centrality of the State of Israel to contemporary Jewish identity, to strengthen the bonds of Jewish communities and Jews in the Diaspora with Israel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/889d69aea1ad8f09311d85d33e42e71ed41ef626.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fighting the delegitimization of Israel====
The WJC recently started to focus its main activity on countering the [[delegitimization of Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/09/02/exclusive-ron-lauder-on-the-deligitimization-of-israel.aspx%20|title=VIDEO: Ron Lauder on the 'Delegitimization of Israel', CBN News, 2 September 2010|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413111541/http://blogs.cbn.com/jerusalemdateline/archive/2010/09/02/exclusive-ron-lauder-on-the-deligitimization-of-israel.aspx|archive-date=2011-04-13|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC lobbies international organizations, notably the United Nations, to ensure that governments "apply the same standards to Israel when judging its actions compared with those of other countries."&lt;ref name="WJC &amp; Supporting Israel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6|title=WJC &amp; Supporting Israel|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122333/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC states on its website that "Israel should not be singled out for criticism by countries which do not themselves adhere to the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law" and that "Israel needs to be treated fairly in international organizations, especially in [[United Nations]] bodies such as the [[UN Human Rights Council]]."&lt;ref name="WJC &amp; Supporting Israel"/&gt;

In early 2009, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder wrote to UN High Commissioner on Human Rights, [[Navi Pillay]], ahead of the [[Durban Review Conference]], asking that the clauses stigmatizing Israel in the 2001 Durban Declaration and Program of Action be repealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/27/idUS145074+27-Mar-2009+PRN20090327%20%20|title=Durban Review Conference: World Jewish Congress Calls for Repeal of 2001 Clauses - WJC Press Release, 27 March 2009|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder also denounced the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]] for issuing what he called a "profoundly unbalanced and biased report" into Israel's raid of the [[Gaza flotilla]] in May 2010. "We note that [the council] has lost its moral compass, where terrorism is deemed activism, and self-defense is called disproportionate violence. If the UNHRC wants to regain the integrity of its original purpose, it cannot submit to being manipulated into justifying and covering up terrorism," the WJC president declared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9595/wjc_condemns_un_human_rights_council_probe_on_flotilla_raid+|title=WJC condemns UN Human Rights Council probe on flotilla raid|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, the World Jewish Congress, together with several Israeli government ministries, convened a consultation entitled 'Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel's Legitimacy' in Jerusalem. It was attended by over 100 professional Jewish leaders from 60 different organizations. The conference identified the need for a collaborative effort on behalf of world Jewry and the State of Israel to advance the protection of Israel's rights and "halt the political and economic assault" against it. Israel's Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], the Minister for Strategic Affairs, [[Moshe Yaalon]], [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] Chairman [[Natan Sharansky]], former Canadian Justice Minister and current member of Parliament [[Irwin Cotler]], Italian lawmaker [[Fiamma Nirenstein]] and international Jewish leaders participated in the consultation, which led to the establishment of the 'Global Coalition for Israel' and the formation of task forces to implement the conclusions reached.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/events/showEvent/id/11 Strategic Consultation - "Building Partnerships and Synergies in Countering the Assault on Israel’s Legitimacy" - WJC website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111208142425/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/events/showEvent/id/11 |date=2011-12-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]], the WJC in September 2011 published a policy book entitled 'The Rights of Israel as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/news/israel_rights_pdf/Israel_Rights.pdf|title=Israel's Rights as a Nation-State in International Diplomacy - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602123855/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/news/israel_rights_pdf/Israel_Rights.pdf|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book features academic articles by international legal and political experts across the political spectrum, including [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Ruth Lapidoth]], Stanley Urman, [[Shlomo Avineri]], [[Martin Gilbert]], [[Dan Diker]] and others. The authors outline Israel's historical and legal rights, the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab countries, and refute all the major claims made against Israel by local and international actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10701/wjc_analysis_israel_s_rights_as_a_nation_state_in_international_diplomacy_|title=WJC ANALYSIS - Israel's rights as a nation-state in international diplomacy|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2017, United Nations Secretary General [[António Guterres]] became the first UN chief ever to address a World Jewish Congress gathering and also addressed the issue of bias against Israel. Speaking in New York to the delegates of the WJC Plenary Assembly, Guterres promised to stand up against anti-Israel bias at the world organization and said the Jewish state "must be treated like any other member state." He also stressed that Israel had an "undeniable right to exist and to live in peace and security with its neighbors," and that "the modern form of anti-Semitism is the denial of the existence of the State of Israel." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/un-chief-vows-to-stand-up-against-anti-israel-bias-anti-semitism/|title=UN chief vows to stand up against anti-Israel bias, anti-Semitism|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Support for peace process and opposition to Palestinian unilateralism====
The World Jewish Congress has endorsed a [[two-state solution]] to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and is opposed to unilateral actions by either side. It states on its website that "a negotiated settlement between Israel and the Palestinians based on a two-state solution is the only legitimate and just way to provide for a lasting peace. The nascent Palestinian state should respect the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law. A Palestinian state can only be founded if it respects Israel's right to exist in security. Initiatives that help to enable the Palestinians to advance economically and socially should also be supported as a means of stabilizing the peace process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6%20|title=Supporting Israel - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520175356/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/6%20|archive-date=2013-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the 2011 UN Security Council vote that would have resulted in the success of the Palestinian unilateral bid for statehood, the WJC worked to underscore what it perceived as a dangerous move for Israel, for the sustainability of a future Palestinian state and for peace in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10709/ronald_s_lauder_on_the_dangers_of_the_palestinian_statehood_motion|title=Ronald S. Lauder on the dangers of the Palestinian statehood motion|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, the World Jewish Congress, together with the [[International Council of Jewish Parliamentarians]], assembled in New York to lobby the international community against allowing the Palestinian Authority's unilateral move to become a full member of the United Nations and bypass negotiations with Israel. At a dinner hosted by WJC President Lauder, the delegation of Jewish parliamentarians engaged in an open discussion with UN ambassadors from key countries including Germany, France, Poland and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icjp.net/events/icjp_steering_committee_meetings_in_new_york_and_washington_d_c_7_8_september_2011/5|title=ICJP - Events|website=www.icjp.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronald Lauder, writing in the German newspaper Die Welt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.welt.de/debatte/kommentare/article12470166/Warum-Israel-Mitglied-der-Nato-werden-muss.html|title=Verteidigungsbündnis: Warum Israel Mitglied der Nato werden muss|first=Ronald S.|last=Lauder|date=7 February 2011|publisher=|via=www.welt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; called for Israel to be admitted into the Western alliance [[NATO]]: "Israel needs real guarantees for its security. European NATO member states – including Turkey – must admit the state of Israel into the Western alliance," the WJC president wrote. He referred to the uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia and said they were reminders of how "unpredictable" developments in the Middle East were. Israeli NATO membership "would send a strong signal to other countries not to take on Israel", Lauder argued.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/world-jewish-congress/44854/call-israel-join-nato Call for Israel to join NATO - Jewish Chronicle, 8 February 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Lauder reacted "with dismay" at a suggestion by Ireland's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Eamon Gilmore to impose a European Union-wide import ban on products made in Israeli settlements in the West Bank, which Gilmore said were "illegal" and made peace between Israel and the Palestinians "impossible". Lauder said: "Such boycott calls are cynical and hypocritical. Minister Gilmore is taking aim at the only liberal democracy in the Middle East while keeping quiet about those who really wreak havoc in the region: the Assads, Ahmadinejads and their allies Hezbollah and Hamas." He added that "the West Bank territories are legally disputed and not illegally occupied."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11814/world_jewish_congress_dismayed_at_irish_call_for_eu_ban_on_israeli_goods_from_west_bank|title=World Jewish Congress dismayed at Irish call for EU ban on Israeli goods from West Bank|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2012, on the third anniversary of Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu#June 2009 peace address; "Bar-Ilan Speech"|Benjamin Netanyahu's speech at Bar-Ilan University]], Lauder published a full-page ad in the [[Wall Street Journal]] and other newspapers in which he called on Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] to return to the negotiating table. "Accept the offer to talk, President Abbas. It takes two sides to make peace," Lauder wrote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4242587,00.html|title=World Jewish Congress urges Abbas to resume talks|date=17 June 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holocaust legacy issues===
The World Jewish Congress continues to focus on Holocaust legacy issues, including the restitution of Jewish assets seized during and after World War II.

====Holocaust remembrance====
Preserving the memory of the [[Shoah]] is a key issue in the WJC's public efforts. In January 2011, WJC President Lauder accompanied German President [[Christian Wulff]] and a number of Holocaust survivors to [[Auschwitz]]. Lauder declared:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Auschwitz is the largest Jewish cemetery in the world. Auschwitz is where the systematic annihilation of European Jewry was refined and perfected. It is where four gas chambers and four crematoria annihilated more than a million Jews. It is the place where the notorious SS ''Doctor'' Josef Mengele conducted cruel medical experiments on people. It is also the place where thousands upon thousands of Poles, Roma and Sinti and Soviet prisoners of war were brutally murdered alongside the Jewish victims. We owe it to all of them, and to the survivors, to make sure that today's anti-Semites and hatemongers – those who want to destroy the Jewish people and its only refugee, the Jewish nation state Israel – will not get another go at it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whjo.info/international-news/82-intl-holocaust-remembrance-day-ronald-lauder-in-auschwitz-for-ceremonies|title=Ronald Lauder in Auschwitz for Ceremonies, 27 January 2011|date=|accessdate=2012-07-02}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On January 28, 2017, WJC President Lauder defended a statement made by President [[Donald Trump]] on the occasion of [[International Holocaust Remembrance Day]] that had generated controversy for failing to mention that the victims of the Holocaust were Jewish. In response to [[Anti-Defamation League]] director [[Jonathan Greenblatt]]'s criticism of the statement, Lauder dismissed concern for remembering the Jewish identities of the victims of the Holocaust as "manufactured controversies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/lauder-criticizes-adls-negative-reaction-to-trump-statement-on-holocaust-remembrance-day-1-6-2017|title=Lauder criticizes ADL reaction to Trump statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day, 28 January 2017|date=|accessdate=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Restitution of Jewish assets====
Since the end of World War II, the WJC has pressed governments and private enterprises to return seized or looted Jewish assets to their rightful owners. It was instrumental in concluding agreements with a number of European countries.

''See above:'' [[World Jewish Congress#Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments|Restitution of Holocaust-era assets and compensation payments]]

In its policy guidelines the WJC states that negotiations on Holocaust-era assets are "conducted in the framework of the World Jewish Restitution Organization in coordination with the Israeli government and with the support of the US government and the European Union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/holocaust.html|title=WJC and the Holocaust|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The organization emphasizes that "the distribution of any compensation monies should not be handled by the WJC. The WJC does not seek any form of commission or gratification payments from Holocaust-era compensation or restitution agreements." WJC leaders have in particular urged the Polish government to come up with a restitution law for looted private properties, but Warsaw in March 2011 announced that this was impossible due to the current economic situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4042812,00.html

====Fighting Holocaust denial, revisionism and glorification of the Nazis====
On repeated occasions, the WJC has urged countries to ensure that Holocaust denial is publicly condemned and fought. WJC officials have been critical of a rise of marches in a number of European countries including Hungary and Serbia by WWII Nazi veterans, far-right extremists and neo-Nazis who publicly glorify the Hitler regime and espouse anti-Semitic ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/20367|title=Serbian police ban neo-Nazi group planned rally - European Jewish Press|date=2007-09-27|accessdate=2012-07-02|archive-url=https://archive.today/20130112200558/http://www.ejpress.org/article/20367|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2007/12/03/world-jewish-congress-asks-pm-to-rein-in-the-far-right/|title=World Jewish Congress asks PM to rein in the far right - Budapest Times|date=2007-12-03|accessdate=2012-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602154248/http://www.budapesttimes.hu/2007/12/03/world-jewish-congress-asks-pm-to-rein-in-the-far-right/|archive-date=2013-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bernie Ecclestone 2012 Bahrain.jpg|thumb|[[Bernie Ecclestone]]]]
In July 2009, [[Bernie Ecclestone]] faced calls from WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] to resign as [[Formula One]] chief after he had praised [[Adolf Hitler]] in a newspaper interview and said that Hitler "got things done." Lauder said someone with Ecclestone's views should not be allowed to run such an important and popular racing series. He urged Formula One teams, drivers and host countries to suspend their cooperation with him. In reaction, Ecclestone told the news agency Associated Press that "I think the people who are saying that haven't got the power to say these things." Asked if the WJC was influential, Ecclestone said: "It's a pity they didn't sort the banks out" and "They have a lot of influence everywhere." After a public outcry, Ecclestone apologized for his remarks and said he had "been an idiot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nascar/story/11923197|title=F1 boss Ecclestone faces criticism over Hitler comments - CBSSports.com|date=2009-07-04|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/sports/jews-call-on-bernie-ecclestone-to-resign-over-hitler-remarks_100214406.html|title=Jews call on Bernie Ecclestone to resign over Hitler remarks - ThaiIndian.com|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/rpm/racing/f1/news/story?id=4308574 |title=Ecclestone: Outrage 'probably my fault' - Associated Press|date=2009-07-06|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WJC also criticized the US internet retailer Amazon.com for selling 'I love Hitler' T-shirts and similar merchandise praising senior Nazi officials. The items were later removed from the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internetretailer.com/2008/04/25/amazon-removes-i-love-hitler-t-shirts-following-protests |title=Amazon removes `I love Hitler` T-shirts following protests - Internet Retailer|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2012, the WJC attacked the German Federal Constitutional Court for a ruling which acquitted a Holocaust denier. WJC Vice-President [[Charlotte Knobloch]] called the verdict "quirky" and said that it cast a damning light on the legal proceedings. She accused the highest German court of disposing of Germany's law that makes the denial of the Shoah a crime "through the backdoor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jspace.com/news/articles/german-courts-find-holocaust-deniers-innocent-in-two-cases/7675|title=German Courts Find Holocaust Deniers Innocent in Two Cases - JSpace, 23 February 2012|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131206042227/http://www.jspace.com/news/articles/german-courts-find-holocaust-deniers-innocent-in-two-cases/7675|archive-date=2013-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an interview with Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] on German public television in which he repeatedly called Israel "an artificial state" that had been built on the "lie of the Holocaust", Knobloch called on the German government to publicly condemn the Iranian leader's statements and to isolate Iran diplomatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11506/following_ahmadinejad_s_latest_holocaust_denial_wjc_urges_germany_to_scale_back_iran_relations|title=Following Ahmadinejad's latest Holocaust denial, WJC urges Germany to scale back Iran relations|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standing alone amongst all major Jewish organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/news/361599/on-holocaust-statement-trump-ally-ron-lauder-stands-alone/|title=On Holocaust Statement, Trump Ally Ron Lauder Stands Alone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder backed Donald Trump's decision to omit any mention of Jews in his 2017 Holocaust commemoration statement. Lauder contended that other Jewish groups were "play[ing] politics" and engaging in "manufactured outrages" that distracted from "real" instances of anti-Semitic threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/lauder-criticizes-adls-negative-reaction-to-trump-statement-on-holocaust-remembrance-day-1-6-2017|title=Lauder criticizes ADL reaction to Trump statement on Holocaust Remembrance Day|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WJC also publicly backed [[David M.

====Prosecution of Nazi war criminals====
The World Jewish Congress has repeatedly called for the prosecution of presumed Nazi war criminals. WJC President Ronald S. Lauder said in 2011: "There must never be impunity or closure for those who were involved in mass murder and genocide, irrespective of their age". The WJC would persist in its efforts to bring the "few old men out there who have the blood of innocent Shoah victims on their hands" before courts of law, to be tried and held accountable for their actions.&lt;ref name="worldjewishcongress.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/10240/ronald_lauder_hails_demjanjuk_conviction_by_german_court|title=Ronald Lauder hails Demjanjuk conviction by German court - WJC website|date=2011-05-12|accessdate=2012-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, WJC officials called for the extradition Ukrainian-born [[John Demjanjuk]] from the United States to Germany, where he was wanted on charges of aiding to kill at least 27,900 Jews at the Sobibor death camp during World War II. Demjanjuk's trial and conviction by a Munich court in May 2011 was hailed by the organization. It declared: "Belatedly, justice has now been done, and the family members of those who were brutally murdered in Sobibor will certainly welcome this verdict."&lt;ref name="worldjewishcongress.org"/&gt;

In December 2010, Lauder publicly urged Serbia to extradite [[Peter Egner]] to the United States where he was wanted to stand trial for serving in a Nazi unit during World War II that murdered 17,000 Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.680news.com/news/world/article/159963--world-jewish-congress-urges-us-to-extradite-alleged-world-war-ii-nazi-to-serbia-for-trial|title=World Jewish Congress urges US to extradite alleged World War II Nazi to Serbia for trial - Associated Press|date=2010-12-21|accessdate=2012-07-02}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Egner died in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torontosun.com/news/world/2011/01/31/17101636.html|title=(no title)|website=Toronto Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighting anti-Semitism===
[[File:WJC meeting with Argentine President Cristina Kirchner.jpg|thumb|[[Eduardo Elsztain]] and [[Ronald S. Lauder]] with Argentine President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] in Buenos Aires, June 2008]]One of the principal activities of the World Jewish Congress has been to fight [[anti-Semitism]] in all its forms. Its stated policy on this issue is: "Governments and international organizations need to provide adequate resources for the fight against hatred, notably by providing security to Jewish communities and by improving education. Laws against anti-Semitism and other forms of racism need to be adopted and enforced properly in every country. All forms and expressions of [[neo-Nazism]], xenophobia and intolerance are unacceptable and have to be condemned, and the full force of the law needs to be applied to those who are a danger to democracy liberty and Jewish communities. Marches by extremist, anti-Semitic groups should be banned where national laws provide for such a possibility. Governments and political leaders should condemn such events and work together with local Jewish communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/1|title=WJC &amp; Combating Anti-Semitism|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602120831/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/1|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an opinion article entitled "Sweden's Shame", WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] attacked the Swedish government, church officials and media for "fanning the flames" of hatred against Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/sweden-s-shame|title=Sweden's Shame by Ronald S. Lauder - Project Syndicate|first=Ronald S.|last=Lauder|date=12 August 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, Lauder condemned as "despicable" remarks made by the Norwegian sociologist [[Johan Galtung]] who had "revived anti-Semitic canards such as Jewish control of the media" and suggested that Israel's Mossad could have been behind the 2011 "massacres in Norway committed by Anders Breivik" in which 77 people died. Lauder declared: "There is a growing tendency to blame the Jews for all evil that happens under the sun. It is a scandal that a leading academics such as Galtung does not shy away from citing notorious forgeries such as the Protocols of the Elders of Zion to support his bigoted arguments."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements |title=Ronald Lauder condemns Norwegian scholar anti-Semitic statements - EJU News, 3 May 2012 |access-date=2012-07-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518075946/http://www.eju.org/news/world/ronald-lauder-condemns-norwegian-scholar-anti-semitic-statements |archive-date=2012-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2012, the WJC president criticized Austrian politicians for failing to publicly denounce the leader of the third-largest political party in the country, the FPÖ, Heinz-Christian Strache, who had posted an anti-Semitic cartoon on his [[Facebook]] page. "Clearly, and not for the first time, the FPÖ leader is trying to whip up anti-Semitic sentiment. His repeated denials are not credible because his words and actions speak for themselves," Ronald Lauder said in a statement, adding: "This scandal shows that anti-Jewish resentment is still widespread, and unscrupulous politicians are allowed to exploit it for electioneering purposes. That is mind-boggling, and it could have negative repercussions for Austrian Jews."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsdaily.com/stories/bre87m0nl-us-austria-rightists-antisemitism/|title=Austrian rightist chief accused of anti-Semitism over cartoon - Reuters, 23 August 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[Budapest]], [[Hungary]] was chosen as a location for the 14th Plenary Assembly because of concerns over the rise of anti-Semitism in that country. Péter Feldmájer, president of the Federation of Jewish Communities in Hungary, stated this was "a symbol of solidarity with our Jewish community, which has been faced with growing anti-Semitism in recent years".&lt;ref name=Budapest1 /&gt; In his speech at the opening dinner, in the presence of Hungarian Prime Minister [[Viktor Orbán]], WJC President Ronald S. Lauder lambasted a series of recent anti-Semitic and racist incidents in Hungary. He particularly mentioned Zsolt Bayer, who had penned a newspaper column referring to Roma as "cowardly, repulsive, noxious animals" that are "unfit to live among people" and "shouldn't be allowed to exist." Lauder said "such words are reminiscent of the darkest era in European history" and concluded that "Hungary's international reputation has suffered in recent years" not because it was being "smeared by the foreign press" but rather due to extremists in the Jobbik party. "Jobbik is dragging the good name of Hungary through the mud," Lauder said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/prime-minister-viktor-orban-downplays-rising-anti-semitism-in-hungary-a-898319.html|title=Missing the Point: Hungarian Leader Whitewashes Anti-Semitism|first=James|last=Kirchick|date=6 May 2013|publisher=|via=Spiegel Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the WJC assembly in Budapest, about 700 Jobbik supporters held a demonstration in downtown Budapest where they railed against "Zionists" who had "subjugated" the "indigenous people" of Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22413301|title=Anti-Jewish rally in Hungary capital|date=4 May 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech to WJC delegates, Orbán condemned the rise in anti-Semitism in Hungary and in Europe more widely. He called it a danger that "threatens even us Christians" and voiced determination to stamp it out. The WJC said in reaction that Orbán had not confronted the true nature of the problem. "We regret that Mr. Orbán did not address any recent anti-Semitic or racist incidents in the country, nor did he provide sufficient reassurance that a clear line has been drawn between his government and the far-right fringe," a WJC spokesman said afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/176038/hungary-premier-viktor-orban-fails-to-take-on-far/?p=all|title=Hungary Premier Viktor Orban Fails To Take on Far Right in Speech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hatred on the internet====
The World Jewish Congress has also urged internet companies, including social media giants such as Google, to act against Holocaust denial, hate speech and anti-Jewish incitement on their platforms. A survey published by the WJC in 2017 revealed that "More than 382,000 anti-Semitic posts were uploaded to social media in 2016, an average of one post every 83 seconds",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/fast-forward/367015/study-anti-semitic-content-posted-on-social-media-every-83-seconds/|title=Anti-Semitic Content Posted On Social Media Every 83 Seconds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which WJC CEO [[R. Robert Singer]] said revealed "how alarming the situation really is."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/an-anti-semitic-post-is-uploaded-to-social-media-every-83-seconds-wjc-research-finds-3-5-2017|title=An anti-Semitic post is uploaded to social media every 83 seconds, WJC research finds|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, the organization had urged the German branch of [[YouTube]] of tolerating clips of neo-Nazi rock bands on its platform that were illegal in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yahoo.com/tech/world-jewish-congress-slams-youtube-over-neo-nazi-153503664.html|title=World Jewish Congress slams YouTube over neo-Nazi videos|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an opinion piece for the [[Los Angeles Times]], Singer also accused the internet retailer [[Amazon.com]] of offering books that glorify the Holocaust. The WJC CEO wrote that Amazon customers "can buy a plethora of Holocaust-denying literature, swastika pendants and other Nazi memorabilia. While books are clearly different from doormats or flags, they still violate Amazon's guidelines, not to mention common decency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-singer-amazon-antisemitism-holocaust-denial-20170302-story.html|title=Why is Amazon selling Holocaust denial and anti-Semitism?|date=2 March 2017|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dialogue with other religions===
The WJC believes that the three Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity and Islam) can cooperate "to respond to the challenges posed by developments in modern society, especially to discuss and promote shared values."&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|title=WJC &amp; Promoting Inter-Faith Dialogue|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607094601/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|archive-date=2012-06-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish-Christian dialogue====
Inter-religious dialogue between Jews and Christians started in the 1940s, notably with the establishment of the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]] in Switzerland in 1947. The WJC has managed to establish good relations with the Catholic Church, especially since the [[Second Vatican Council]] and the Declaration ''[[Nostra aetate]]'' in 1965. Progress, however, is slow with regard to the Orthodox and Protestant Churches, which according to the WJC is mainly due to the decentralized nature of these churches and certain political issues related to the Middle East conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|title=WJC &amp; Promoting Inter-Faith Dialogue - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607094601/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/4|archive-date=2012-06-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1945, WJC leaders have been received by Catholic pontiffs a number of times. [[Pope Pius XII]] received WJC Secretary General A.

On his election as new Catholic pontiff, [[Ronald Lauder]] called Cardinal [[Jorge Mario Bergoglio]] "an experienced man, someone who is known for his open-mindedness ... a man of dialogue, a man who is able to build bridges with other faiths".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelhayom.com/site/newsletter_article.php?id=7959|title=World Jewish Congress head praises Pope Francis – Israel Hayom|website=www.israelhayom.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was instrumental in the creation inter-faith bodies such as the International Jewish Committee of Inter-religious Consultations (IJCIC), and it has actively participated in the [[International Catholic-Jewish Liaison Committee]] (ILC). The WJC also contributed to the establishment of diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Holy See in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1993/11/18/2879808/vatican-israel-near-accord-on-diplomatic-relations|title=Vatican, Israel Near Accord on Diplomatic Relations|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, the WJC persuaded Pope John II to come out in favor of the removal of a convent of Carmelite nuns which had opened near the site of the former Nazi death camp Auschwitz.

The role of the Vatican during the Holocaust remains a controversial issue and has repeatedly flared up. The [[beatification]] and possible [[canonization]] of [[Pope Pius XII]] was criticized by WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]], who said that all Vatican archives on the period should be made accessible to scholars. "There are strong concerns about [[Pope Pius XII]]'s political role during World War II which should not be ignored," Lauder declared in a statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clericalwhispers.blogspot.be/2009/12/wjc-chides-vatican-on-pius-xii.html|title=WJC chides Vatican on Pius XII|website=clericalwhispers.blogspot.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, Lauder and the WJC were highly critical of the Vatican's decision to revoke the excommunication of [[Bishop Richard Williamson]], a senior member of the dissident Catholic group [[Society of St. Pius X]]. Williamson, in an interview with Swedish television, had denied the existence of gas chambers in Nazi concentration camps. Lauder said: "The Vatican was badly advised to revoke the excommunication of the four bishops ... Therefore, we call on Pope Benedict XVI to urgently address these concerns and to ensure that the achievements of four decades of Catholic-Jewish dialogue are not being damaged by a small minority of people who want to divide rather than unite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3667289,00.html|title=YNetNews: WJC head: Holocaust denial must be censured|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauder later praised Benedict XVI for writing a personal letter to Catholic bishops in which the Pope explained himself. "The Pope has found clear and unequivocal words regarding Bishop Williamson's Holocaust denial, and he deserves praise for admitting that mistakes were made within the Vatican in the handling of this affair," the WJC president was quoted as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=12347|title=World Jewish Congress President praises Pope - Catholic News, 13 March 2009|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717125915/http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=12347|archive-date=2012-07-17|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Ronald S. Lauder]] was also critical of the continued use of the [[Good Friday Prayer for the Jews]] in church liturgy. In an op-ed for the Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'', the WJC president wrote: "When the Pope allows the use of the Good Friday Prayer of the old Tridentine liturgy, which calls for Jews to acknowledge Jesus Christ as the Savior of all men, some of us are deeply hurt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/8806/op_ed_ronald_lauder_calls_on_pope_benedict_xvi_to_clarify_vatican_s_stance_on_pius_xii|title=Op-Ed: Ronald Lauder calls on Pope Benedict XVI to clarify Vatican's stance on Pius XII|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dialogue with Islam====
[[File:Interreligious-Meeting - Mustafa Ceric - Herman Van-Rompuy-Marc-Schneier - Abdujalil Sajid - Brussels 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Bosnia's Grand Mufti [[Mustafa Ceric]], European Council President [[Herman Van Rompuy]], WJC Vice-President Rabbi [[Marc Schneier]], and British Imam Abdujalil Sajid in Brussels, December 2010]]

The World Jewish Congress considers dialogue with representatives of moderate [[Islam]] as "one of the most important and challenging issues at this time. The increasing gap of understanding between so-called Western liberal democracies and the Islamic world is extremely dangerous," according to the WJC website.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

In 2008, WJC leaders met with King [[Abdullah of Saudi Arabia]] at an inter-faith conference in the Spanish capital Madrid. Later that year, WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] also called on the Saudi monarch in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/8419?print=true|title=WJC leaders meet with Saudi king in New York|accessdate=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130520210723/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/main/showNews/id/8419?print=true|archive-date=2013-05-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011, WJC Vice-President [[Marc Schneier]] was received by King Hamad of Bahrain at the royal palace in Manama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/11100/wjc_vice_president_schneier_deeply_honored_to_be_first_rabbi_hosted_by_king_hamad_of_bahrain|title=WJC Vice President Schneier 'deeply honored' to be first rabbi hosted by King Hamad of Bahrain|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Jewish Congress also co-hosted a gathering of European Muslim and Jewish leaders in Brussels in December 2010, which included meetings with senior European Union officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3996576,00.html|title=UK Imam prays for Carmel Fire victims|date=9 December 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On that occasion, WJC Vice-President Marc Schneier declared: "We have hopefully kick-started a movement that will spread across Europe. The recipe really is quite simple: our two communities must focus more on what unites us than what separates us. We also must restrain the radicals within our own ranks and make sure they don't gain the upper hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/47697|title=Brussels gathering calls for closer cooperation between Muslims and Jews in Europe - European Jewish Press, 6 December 2010|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-05|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112173423/www.ejpress.org/article/47697|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in London in 2010, Schneier praised leaders of the [[Al-Azhar University]] in Cairo, considered the oldest center of Islamic scholarship in the world, for opening up inter-religious dialogue to the Jews. He declared: "This is a landmark decision, and Al-Azhar deserves praise for it. Coming from the leading center of Islamic thinking in the world, it will be enormously helpful for all moderate forces within Islam. [ ... ] Leaders from both sides should now seize the opportunity and take Jewish-Muslim relations to the next level. Both communities have a lot more in common, and to give to the other side, than many people think."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=42714|title=.:Middle East Online::Al-Azhar invites Jews to inter-faith talks :.|website=www.middle-east-online.com|access-date=2012-07-10|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171206142712/http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=42714|archive-date=2017-12-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pluralistic Israel===
In August 2018, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder called on "Israel's government to listen to the voices of protest and outrage" and uphold the country's democratic and egalitarian principles against the threat of dominance by restrictive Orthodox influence, from what he called 'a radical minority'.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/opinion/israel-ronald-lauder-nation-state-law.html Israel, This Is Not Who We Are], [[New York Times]], opinion by WJC President Ronald S.

===Opposing Iran===
Since the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic revolution in 1979]], and in particular following the terrorist attacks [[1992 attack on Israeli embassy in Buenos Aires|against the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires in February 1992]] and the [[1994 AMIA bombing|AMIA Jewish center in Buenos Aires in July 1994]], in which over 100 people were killed and which Iran's leadership was accused of having masterminded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1995/01/04/2882946/six-months-after-bombing-argentina-recalls-ambassador|title=Six Months After Bombing, Argentina Recalls Ambassador|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Jewish Congress has been vocal in denouncing what it calls the "Iranian threat".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/5|title=WJC &amp; the Iranian Threat - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624065358/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/5|archive-date=2012-06-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, then WJC President [[Edgar Bronfman, Sr.]] was reportedly instrumental in blocking a planned deal by the [[DuPont]]-owned US oil firm [[Conoco]] with Iran. Bronfman was a member of the DuPont board of directors. The deal would have been the first major investment by an oil company in Iran since 1979, when the United States broke off trade with the country after the seizure of the US Embassy in Teheran by Islamic militants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-15/business/fi-43080_1_clinton-administration-officials Clinton Kills Pending Iran-Conoco Oil Deal : Policy: Order will bar development in Mideast nation and reassert hard-line stance taken since '79 hostage crisis - ''Los Angeles Times'', 15 March 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the WJC publicly welcomed a decision by US President [[Bill Clinton]] to impose a trade embargo on Iran. "We applaud President Clinton's decisive blow against terrorism," declared WJC Executive Director Elan Steinberg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.jta.org/article/1995/05/02/2882394/from-buenos-aires-to-new-york-jews-applaud-move-against-iran|title=From Buenos Aires to New York, Jews Applaud Move Against Iran|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, after prosecutors in Argentina asked a judge to order the arrest of a former Iranian President [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and other members of his government in connection with the [[1994 AMIA bombing|AMIA bombing]], Bronfman said that "Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism", adding that "the entire international community has a moral responsibility to ensure that Iran is held accountable for its terrorist actions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/8300/edgar_m_bronfman_iran_is_a_sponsor_of_terrorism_|title=Edgar M.

The WJC lobbied for the issuing of [[Interpol notice|Red Notices]] by [[Interpol]] against the Iranian suspects in the bombing case, which were approved by the Interpol General Assembly in November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voices.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-says-interpol-has-proven-the-646645.html?cat=17|title=Yahoo|website=Yahoo|access-date=2012-07-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207202921/http://voices.yahoo.com/world-jewish-congress-says-interpol-has-proven-the-646645.html?cat=17|archive-date=2013-12-07|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the 18th anniversary of the AMIA bombing in July 2012, WJC President Lauder declared: "The Iranian regime has blood on its hands, not only by suppressing dissent at home but also by sponsoring terrorism world-wide. What the world saw 18 years ago in Buenos Aires it can still see today, be it in Syria, in Lebanon or in other places."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejc.com/news/world-news/70170/iran-has-blood-its-hands-over-1994-argentina-blast Iran has 'blood on its hands' over 1994 Argentina blast – ''Jewish Chronicle'', 17 July 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 resolution on Iran, the WJC expressed support for international condemnation of current Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s repeated calls for the abolition of the State of Israel and his statements questioning the Holocaust. The organization resolved "to make the four-fold threat (the nuclear threat; the threat of genocidal incitement; international state sponsored terrorism; and the systematic and widespread violations of the human and civil rights of the Iranian people) that the current Iranian regime poses to international peace and stability, a high strategic priority of the WJC."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/fd1f7613f1eb2952cd96fba32ecc307cd45d672b.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the WJC launched the ''Iran Update'', "a comprehensive weekly publication disseminated via the internet to most members of the US Congress and government, United Nations missions, foreign diplomats, European Union officials, and Israeli policymakers, in addition to Jewish communities worldwide." The publication focused on exposing Iran's ongoing pursuit of a nuclear capability, domestic Iranian politics, Iranian foreign policy in the Middle East and internationally, Israeli policy vis-à-vis Iran and the efforts of worldwide Jewish communities in combating Iranian Holocaust-denial and nuclear proliferation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d1eede45968612158044b79bf6a95e1c5fc2a85b.pdf+|title=World Jewish Congress|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|website=www.worldjewishcongress.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further to the WJC's and other international organizations' calls, representatives of many Western countries either did not show up or walked out of the conference chamber when Iranian President Ahmadinejad attacked Israel in his speech to the Durban Review Conference in Geneva in April 2009 and to the [[United Nations General Assembly]] meeting in New York in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/wjc-world-must-boycott-ahmadinejad-speech-at-un-1.7905|title=WJC: World Must Boycott Ahmadinejad Speech at UN|first=Shlomo|last=Shamir|date=14 September 2009|publisher=|via=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/iran|title=UN Chamber Mostly Empty for Ahmadinejad Speech - WJC website, September 2009|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724082049/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/iran|archive-date=2012-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The WJC has repeatedly run campaigns accusing Iran of deceiving the international community and calling Ahmadinejad "the world's foremost hatemonger".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9013/stoppt_irans_diktator_+|title=Stoppt Irans Diktator!|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, WJC President [[Ronald S. Lauder]] criticized a visit by Swiss Foreign Minister [[Micheline Calmy-Rey]] to Tehran, where she met with Ahmadinejad mainly to help a Swiss company secure a multibillion-dollar contract to buy natural gas from Iran. Lauder told a press conference in Bern: "Maybe that money that Switzerland is paying to Iran will some day be used to either buy weapons to kill Israelis, or buy weapons to kill Americans, or buy missiles to be able to deliver nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2008-04-29-3972860867_x.htm+|title=Latest World &amp; National News &amp; Headlines - USATODAY.com|website=www.usatoday.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lauder also led diplomatic efforts to persuade European businesses to withdraw from Iran.

The WJC has repeatedly urged the international community to do more to bring to justice the masterminds of the terrorist attacks against Israel's embassy and AMIA Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in the 1990s, which Argentinean prosecutors have said were carried out at the instigation of senior Iranian officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/56827|title=20 years after Buenos Aires bombing attack, World Jewish Congress urges to do more to root out Iran-sponsored international terror - European Jewish Press, 16 March 2012|publisher=|access-date=2012-07-09|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130112153852/www.ejpress.org/article/56827|archive-date=2013-01-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Olympic news outlet ''Around the Rings''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aroundtherings.com/articles/view.aspx?id=37563 |title=Calls to Ban Iran from Olympics; Olympic Obituaries |publisher=Aroundtherings.com |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that World Jewish Congress president [[Ronald S. Lauder]] had issued a statement urging IOC officials to ban Iran from participating in the Olympic Games, citing Iranian athletes' refusal to compete against Israeli athletes. "It is high time that a strong signal is sent to Iran that unless this long-standing boycott is lifted, Iranian athletes will not be allowed to enter major international events such as next year's Olympic Games in London", Lauder said. The WJC reiterated its position when in May 2012 Iranian President Ahmadinejad announced plans to attend the London Olympics.  Ahmadinejad has "no business" attending the London Olympic Games this summer, the ''Jewish Chronicle'' quoted a World Jewish Congress spokesman as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/67809/irans-ahmadinejad-wants-come-london-olympics|title=Iran's Ahmadinejad wants to come to the London Olympics|publisher=Jewish Chronicle|date=2012-05-18 |accessdate=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish refugees from Arab countries===
The issue of [[Jewish refugees from Arab lands]] continues to be on the World Jewish Congress agenda today. The WJC website states that "The plight of Jews who fled from, or still live in, Arab lands and their specific concerns are not well-known and need to be raised with governments and international organizations. Where illegal seizure of assets took place, these should be returned to their former owners, or adequate compensation should be paid. Jews remaining in Arab lands, as well as other religious minorities, should be granted religious freedom and allowed to practice their faith according to their traditions. Jewish communal sites in Arab countries must be preserved and respected." The WJC believes that the plight of the Jewish refugees from Arab lands has been neglected for decades by the international community, including governments and international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/2|title=WJC &amp; Jews From Arab Lands|publisher=|access-date=2012-06-07|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120602122939/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/issues/2|archive-date=2012-06-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, the WJC co-hosted two conferences on the issue, together with the Israeli government. They were held in Jerusalem and at the [[United Nations]] headquarters in New York, respectively. The aim was to raise the profile of the issue and enlist international support. In a speech to the New York symposium, WJC President Ronald S. Lauder urged the world to recognize the suffering of Jewish refugees. "Now is the time to set the historical, diplomatic and legal record straight. Lasting peace can only be built on historical facts - both the issues of the Jewish refugees and the Palestinian refugees must be addressed." Lauder said that "only addressing the historical facts" could help to bring about peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/12336/peace_only_possible_if_plight_of_jewish_refugees_from_arab_countries_is_addressed_lauder_tells_un|title=Peace only possible if plight of Jewish refugees from Arab countries is addressed, Lauder tells UN|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Jerusalem conference, a joint declaration was adopted calling on the United Nations to place the issue of Jewish refugees on its agenda and that of its affiliated forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d0a520a41e671e66473c81cbbc5bc792c553fb93.pdf|title=Jerusalem Declaration on Justice for Jews from Arab Countries|publisher=|access-date=2012-10-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024065533/http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/uploads/materials/d0a520a41e671e66473c81cbbc5bc792c553fb93.pdf|archive-date=2012-10-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian critics derided the move to raise this issue now as a "manipulative strategy". It was "part of a public relations campaign that is both cynical and hypocritical", PLO Executive member [[Hanan Ashrawi]] told the newspaper [[USA Today]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2012/10/11/jewish-refugees-from-war-of-independence-seek-justice/1621037/|title=Jewish refugees want 'justice' like Palestinians, some say it's a ploy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the conferences, Israel's Foreign Minister [[Avigdor Lieberman]] instructed Israeli diplomats around the world to raise the matter in all official government meetings and with parliamentarians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/JewishWorld/JewishNews/Article.aspx?id=289051|title=Diaspora - Jewish people world news - The Jerusalem Post|website=www.jpost.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures provided by the Israeli Foreign Ministry, approximately 850,000 Jews from Arab states across the Middle East left their native countries following the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948 due to state-sponsored persecution. Most of them were forced to abandon their property and possessions, the ministry said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=284548|title=PM: Israel must bring justice to Jewish Refugees - Jerusalem Post, 10 September 2012|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other issues===
In August 2008, World Jewish Congress and Venezuelan Jewish community leaders met in Caracas with Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chávez Frias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/3716|title=Venezuela Analysis: Venezuela's Chavez Meets with President of World Jewish Congress|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting stirred some controversy in the Jewish world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/comment/4668/shame-those-our-leaders-who-back-chavez|title=Jewish Chronicle - Isi Leibler: Shame on those of our leaders who back Chavez|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of Chávez' public support for Iranian leader [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] and his strong criticism of Israel. However, then WJC Secretary-General Michael Schneider defended the meeting with Chávez and said the WJC acted only on behalf of, and with the backing of, the Venezuelan Jewish community.

Following the exclusion of Israeli tennis player [[Shahar Peer]] from an [[Association of Tennis Professionals|ATP]] tournament in Dubai in February 2009, the WJC called for the "suspension of all sporting events in the [United Arab Emirates] until Israeli participants are admitted." The response of the women's and men's tours to the exclusion of Peer had been "faint-hearted," and they should have canceled the event immediately, WJC President Lauder was quoted by the news agency [[Bloomberg News|Bloomberg]] as saying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/9061/israel_player_ram_to_get_dubai_visa_congressman_says|title=Israel Player Ram to Get Dubai Visa, Congressman Says|first=World Jewish|last=Congress|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahead of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London, the World Jewish Congress criticized the president of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Jacques Rogge]], for not agreeing to hold one minute's silence at the opening ceremony in remembrance of the [[Munich Massacre|eleven Israeli sportsmen killed by Palestinian terrorists during the Olympic Games in Munich in 1972]]. Ronald Lauder said Rogge's stance was "unfeeling" and "completely out of touch."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/07/22/sport/olympics-munich-silence/index.html|title=Olympics head rejects silence for Israeli victims - CNN|first=By Richard Allen Greene,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: "Forty years after the saddest moment in Olympic history - when eleven Israeli athletes and sports officials and a German police officer were killed by Palestinian terrorists - it would have been an excellent opportunity to show to everyone that the sports world stands united against terrorism ... Nobody wants to 'politicize' the Olympic Games, as the IOC seems to suggest, but Baron Rogge and his colleagues on the IOC Executive have utterly failed - or refused - to grasp the importance of such a symbolic act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/news/jewish-group-slams-olympics-for-refusing-munich-massacre-minute-of-silence-1.452910|title=Haaretz.Com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundraising and finances==
The WJC raises its funds mainly through the World Jewish Congress American Section, which is a non-profit body registered in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/donate_support|title=Donate Today - WJC website|publisher=|access-date=2013-06-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130829021554/https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/donate_support|archive-date=2013-08-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies, internal conflicts and allegations of financial irregularities (2004-2007)===
A series of allegations about the organization's accounting practices and "unusual" money transfers, was raised in 2004 by [[Isi Leibler]], then a vice-president of the WJC. It led to an investigation of the finances of the World Jewish Congress.&lt;ref name=buncombe/&gt; A comprehensive audit of the WJC's accounts in Switzerland from 1995–2004, conducted by the accounting firm [[PricewaterhouseCoopers]], reportedly found that "over the years $3.8 million 'disappeared' from the bank accounts"&lt;ref name=barkat&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkat |first=Amiram |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/828961.html |title=Where was Edgar Bronfman? | work=Haaretz  |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that there were "significant un-reconciled cash withdrawals where there is no documentation of the usage of the funds."&lt;ref name=popperwjcaudit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/wjc-audit-4-million-unaccounted-for/ |title=WJC Audit: $3 Million Unaccounted For – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2006-11-03 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2006, an investigation by the Office of the NY State Attorney General into the matter found no evidence of criminal conduct on the part of the WJC.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Strom, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/16/us/16jewish.html World Jewish Congress Dismisses Leader]", [[The New York Times]], March 16, 2007. Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the report of Attorney General [[Eliot Spitzer]] noted that the WJC had implemented all of his recommendations to improve financial oversight and management.

Spitzer's office identified financial mismanagement and breaches of fiduciary duty, but found no criminal wrongdoing and concluded that any misconduct "did not compromise the core mission" of the organization or result in "identifiable losses of charitable assets."&lt;ref name=edenpopper&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/ny-probe-of-charity-cites-mismanagement/ |title=N.Y. Probe of Charity Cites Mismanagement – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2006-02-03 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The report also highlighted several initiatives the WJC had taken since 2004 to improve financial management, including "the creation of an audit committee and the position of chief financial officer, the computerization of all financial records, the creation of an employee handbook outlining official procedures and policies, the implementation of travel and reimbursement procedures, and the creation of a new fund-raising entity (the WJC Foundation)."&lt;ref&gt;Ami Eden and Nathanial Popper, "[http://forward.com/articles/1583/ny-probe-of-charity-cites-mismanagement NY Probe of Charity Cites Mismanagement]," [[The Jewish Daily Forward]], February 3, 2006. Retrieved June 24, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite vigorously defending [[Israel Singer]] during the Attorney General's inquiry, in March 2007 Bronfman abruptly announced his firing. He accused Singer of "'help[ing] himself to cash from the WJC office, my cash."&lt;ref name=barkat2&gt;{{cite web|last=Barkat |first=Amiram |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/841279.html |title=Members of the Tribe / The end of a beautiful friendship - Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, internal WJC documents seemed to suggest that a friction had developed between Singer and Bronfman over Singer's position on various internal WJC political matters, including the perception that he was insufficiently advocating the candidacy of Edgar Bronfman's son [[Matthew Bronfman|Matthew]] to the presidency of the WJC.&lt;ref name=popperduo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/ugly-allegations-fly-as-fabled-wjc-duo-splits/ |title=Ugly Allegations Fly as Fabled WJC Duo Splits – |publisher=Forward.com |date=2007-03-23 |accessdate=2012-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, Edgar Bronfman stood down as WJC president, having served in this post for 28 years.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Strom. President of Jewish Congress Resigns After 3 Years' Turmoil. [[New York Times]]. May 8, 2007, Section A, Page 16, Column 4, 643 words&lt;/ref&gt;
