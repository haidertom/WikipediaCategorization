'''Aluminium toxicity in people on dialysis''' (or '''aluminium toxicity''') is a problem for people on [[haemodialysis]]. The dialysis process does not efficiently remove excess [[aluminium]] from the body, so it may build up over time. Aluminium is a potentially toxic metal, and [[aluminium poisoning]] may lead to mainly three disorders: aluminium-induced [[bone disease]], [[microcytic anemia]] and neurological dysfunction ([[encephalopathy]]). Such conditions are more prominently observed in people with [[chronic renal failure]] and especially in people on haemodialysis.

About 5–10&amp;nbsp;mg of aluminium enters our body daily through different sources like water, food, occupational exposure to aluminium in industries etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://carl/ |title=AB, Edward RA.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1385">'''ArchiLab''' is an annual architectural exposition and conference held in [[Orléans]] in France. So far, there have been ArchiLab projects every year from 1999 to 2008.

== ArchiLab 2001 ==

More than 90 [[architect]]s were invited to present their projects during the third International meeting on [[Architecture]] held in [[Orléans]] in 2001. This meeting brings together the architects of the world for whom lodging together is a chance for thinking about new conceptual strategies.  Faced with an increasing standardization in the [[construction industry]] and the fashion of dwellings in constant change, the challenge of the innovator is to adapt to these times of constant change.  
Modern communications have introduced us to a greater cultural diversity but, on the other hand, increasing industrialization has led to uniformity in the construction process.

The projects are grouped in a way to represent various attitudes towards the question of housing.
*Individual or collective habitation
*Flexibility
*Effects on landscape
*New life styles
*Subversion 
*Form and process of creation

'''The Beaumont and Fletcher folios''' were two large [[book size|folio]] collections of the stage plays of [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] and his collaborators. The first was issued in 1647, and the second in 1679. The two collections were important in preserving many works of [[English Renaissance theatre|English Renaissance drama]].

==The first folio, 1647==
The 1647 folio was published by the booksellers [[Humphrey Moseley]] and [[Humphrey Robinson]]. It was modelled on the precedents of the first two folio collections of [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Shakespeare's plays]], published in 1623 and 1632, and the first two folios of the [[Ben Jonson folios|works of Ben Jonson]] of 1616 and 1640–1. The title of the book was given as ''Comedies and Tragedies Written by Francis Beaumont and John Fletcher Gentlemen,'' though the prefatory matter in the folio recognised that [[Philip Massinger]], rather than [[Francis Beaumont]], collaborated with Fletcher on some of the plays included in the volume. (In fact, the 1647 volume "contained almost nothing of Beaumont's" work.)&lt;ref&gt;Lee Bliss, in Kinney, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt; Seventeen works in Fletcher's canon that had already been published prior to 1647, and the rights to these plays belonged to the stationers who had issued those volumes; Robinson and Moseley therefore concentrated on the previously unpublished plays in the Fletcher canon.

Most of these plays had been acted onstage by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], the troupe of actors for whom Fletcher had functioned as house dramatist for most of his career. The folio featured a dedication to [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke]], signed by ten of the King's Men – [[John Lowin]], [[Joseph Taylor (17th-century actor)|Joseph Taylor]], [[Richard Robinson (17th-century actor)|Richard Robinson]], [[Robert Benfield]], [[Eliard Swanston]], Thomas Pollard, Hugh Clark, William Allen, [[Stephen Hammerton]], and [[Theophilus Bird]] – all idled by the closing of the theatres in 1642. It also contained two addresses to the reader, by [[James Shirley]] and by Moseley, and 37 [[commendatory poem]]s, long and short, by figures famous and obscure, including Shirley, [[Ben Jonson]],&lt;ref&gt;Jonson, a decade dead by 1647, was posthumously represented with an excerpt from his poem to Beaumont.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Lovelace]], [[Robert Herrick (poet)|Robert Herrick]], [[Richard Brome]], [[Jasper Mayne]], [[Thomas Stanley (author)|Thomas Stanley]], and Sir [[Aston Cockayne]].

The 1647 folio contains 35 works – 34 plays and 1 [[masque]].

The 1647 folio has attracted significant attention from scholars and bibliographers, and various specialised studies of the folio (books on the book) have been written.&lt;ref&gt;Logan and Smith, pp. 83–5.&lt;/ref&gt; As with Shakespeare's [[First Folio]], the typesetting of individual compositors and the work of individual printers has been traced and analysed – including that of Susan Islip, one of the rare instances of a female printer in the 17th century.

==The second folio, 1679==
The second folio, titled ''Fifty Comedies and Tragedies,'' was published by the booksellers [[Henry Herringman]],&lt;ref&gt;Herringman was a member of the syndicates of stationers who issued the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Fourth Folio]] of Shakespeare's plays in 1685, and the [[Ben Jonson folios|third Ben Jonson folio]] in 1692.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Martyn (publisher)|John Martyn]], and [[John and Richard Marriot|Richard Marriot]]; the printing was done by J. Macock. The three stationers had obtained the rights to previously-published works,&lt;ref&gt;The 17 printed before 1647, and ''[[The Wild Goose Chase]],'' which had been published in 1652.&lt;/ref&gt; and added 18 dramas to the 35 of the first folio, for a total of 53. The second folio added features that the first lacked. Many songs in the plays were given in full. Cast lists were prefixed to 25 of the dramas, lists that provide the names of the leading actors in the original productions of the plays. These lists can be informative on the companies involved and the dates of first productions; the cast list prefixed to ''[[The Honest Man's Fortune]],'' for example, reveals that the play was originally staged by the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]] in the 1612–13 period.

On the negative side, the texts in the second folio were set into type from the previously-printed quarto texts, and never from manuscript; the texts of the plays in the first collection were printed from manuscript sources.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content, authorship, and canon==

The implicit canon, nearly realized by the contents of the second folio, comprises dramatic works written by Beaumont or Fletcher; either alone, together, or in collaboration with other playwrights. By this rule, likely, four plays should be excluded (''The Laws of Candy'' by [[John Ford (dramatist)|John Ford]], ''Wit at Several Weapons'' by [[Thomas Middleton|Middleton]] and [[William Rowley|Rowley]], ''The Nice Valour'' by Middleton, and ''The Coronation'' by [[James Shirley]]), and three more extant plays should be included (''Barnavelt'', ''A Very Woman'', and ''Henry VIII''). ''[[A Very Woman]]'' was printed in a volume of Massinger's plays in 1655, while ''[[Sir John van Olden Barnavelt]]'' remained in manuscript until the 19th century. ''Henry VIII'' was first published in the Shakespeare [[First Folio]] of 1623.

At least five plays, no longer extant, may also belong in the canon. Four of these were entered to Moseley in the [[Stationers' Register]] between 1653 and 1660, possibly with the intent of printing them in the second folio: ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'' (Shakespeare and Fletcher?), ''A Right Woman'' (Beaumont and Fletcher?), ''The Wandering Lovers'' (Fletcher?), and ''The Jeweler of Amsterdam'' (Fletcher, Field, and Massinger?). A fifth non-extant play, ''The Queen'' was questionably attributed to Fletcher by a contemporary.&lt;ref&gt;Bowers 1966, [https://books.google.com/books?id=_pBDWgpg_AwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PR31#v=onepage&amp;f=false p xxxi].&lt;/ref&gt;

The folios contain two works that are generally thought to be the work of Beaumont alone – ''The Knight of the Burning Pestle'' and ''The Masque of the Inner Temple and Gray's Inn'' – and fifteen that are solo efforts by Fletcher, and perhaps a dozen that are actual Beaumont/Fletcher collaborations. The rest are Fletcher's collaborations with Massinger and other writers.

While in 1962, Hoy attributed the play to Fletcher and Middleton (p 86), Bowers later marked Fletcher's contribution as less secure (1996, pp 751-52). In 1979, Jackson found "no evidence" for Fletcherian authorship, while more recent opinion has tended toward sole authorship for Middleton (Taylor &amp; Lavagnino 2007 ''Companion'', pp 423-24).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later editions==
The folios limited but did not extinguish the market for individual editions of the plays; such editions were printed when the chances for profit seemed favourable. Humphrey Robinson and Alice Moseley (Humphrey Moseley's widow) issued a quarto of ''Beggar's Bush'' in 1661, for example. During the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era and into the 18th century, the plays in the Beaumont/Fletcher canon were very popular – though they were often performed in adapted versions rather than in the originals; and the adaptations then appeared in print. An adaptation of ''The Island Princess'' was published in 1669; and adapted version of ''Monsieur Thomas'' was printed in 1678.  ''Beggar's Bush'' became ''The Royal Merchant,'' published in 1706 – and later, ''The Merchant of Bruges.''&lt;ref&gt;Potter, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; This trend in favour of new adaptations over original versions made it easier for Herringman, Martyn, and Mariot to obtain permissions to reprint those originals in their 1679 collection.

== Research ==
Sandilands' first book, ''The Good-Natured Feminist: Ecofeminism and the Quest for Democracy'' was published in 1999 by University of Minnesota Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/614485156|title=The good-natured feminist : ecofeminism and the quest for democracy|last=Mortimer-Sandilands|first= Catriona|date=1999|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=9780816688869|location=Minneapolis|oclc=614485156}}&lt;/ref&gt; It explores identity, gender and democracy through the lens of [[ecofeminism]] and the perceived relationships between the category of "women" and nature.&lt;ref name=Oxford/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=MacGregor, Sherilyn | title=Beyond mothering earth : ecological citizenship and the politics of care | publication-date=2006 | publisher=UBC Press | isbn=978-0-7748-1201-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandilands invokes a multitude of contemporary feminist and political theorizations of democracy, including [[Donna Haraway]]'s cyborg feminism. ''The Good-Natured Feminist'' was described as "a strikingly original and vitally important contribution to debates in feminist theory, environmental thought, and cultural studies ...... an essential text not only for those engaged in ecofeminist projects, but, more broadly, for anyone interested in feminism, environmentalism, or social and political theory."&lt;ref&gt;Alaimo, S 2001, ‘Wild Democracy: The Politics of Ecofeminism’, ''Topia'' (University of Toronto Press), no. 6, p. 121, viewed 20 October 2018, &lt;http://search.ebscohost.com.rp.nla.gov.au/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=5841843&amp;site=ehost-live&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Sandilands co-edited the multidisciplinary anthology ''This Elusive Land: Women and the Canadian Environment'' with Melody Hessing and Rebecca Raglon.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11332">'''Cheminformatics''' (also known as '''chemoinformatics''', '''chemioinformatics''' and '''chemical informatics''')  is the use of computer and [[Information science|informational]] techniques applied to a range of problems in the field of [[chemistry]]. These ''[[in silico]]'' techniques are used, for example, in [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] and academic settings in the process of [[drug discovery]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Zhou|first2=Hongyi|last3=Kubanek|first3=Julia|last4=Skolnick|first4=Jeffrey|date=2014-04-26|title=Experimental validation of FINDSITEcomb virtual ligand screening results for eight proteins yields novel nanomolar and micromolar binders|journal=Journal of Cheminformatics|language=En|volume=6|issue=1|pages=16|doi=10.1186/1758-2946-6-16|issn=1758-2946|pmc=4038399|pmid=24936211}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These methods can also be used in chemical and allied industries in various other forms.

== History ==

The term chemoinformatics was defined by F.K. Brown&lt;ref name="Brown_1998"&gt;{{Cite book | author = F.K. Brown | title = Chapter 35. Chemoinformatics: What is it and How does it Impact Drug Discovery | journal = Annual Reports in Med.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Chemoinformatics is the mixing of those information resources to transform data into information and information into knowledge for the intended purpose of making better decisions faster in the area of drug lead identification and optimization.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since then, both spellings have been used, and some have evolved to be established as Cheminformatics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.molinspiration.com/chemoinformatics.html Cheminformatics or Chemoinformatics ?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; while European Academia settled in 2006 for Chemoinformatics.&lt;ref name="Obernai"&gt;[http://infochim.u-strasbg.fr/chemoinformatics/Obernai%20Declaration.pdf Obernai Declaration]&lt;/ref&gt; The recent establishment of the [[Journal of Cheminformatics]] is a strong push towards the shorter variant.

== Basics ==
Cheminformatics combines the scientific working fields of [[chemistry]], [[computer science]] and [[information science]] for example in the areas of [[topology (chemistry)|topology]], [[chemical graph theory]], [[information retrieval]] and [[data mining]] in the [[chemical space]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roy|first=Ambrish|last2=Srinivasan|first2=Bharath|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=2015-08-12|title=PoLi: A Virtual Screening Pipeline Based on Template Pocket and Ligand Similarity|journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling|language=EN|volume=55|issue=8|pages=1757–1770|doi=10.1021/acs.jcim.5b00232|issn=1549-9596|pmc=4593500|pmid=26225536}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei‡|first2=Sam|last3=Roy§|first3=Ambrish|last4=Zhou|first4=Hongyi|last5=Skolnick|first5=Jeffrey|date=2018-09-07|title=Chemical space of Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors: New approaches for discovering novel drugs for old bugs|journal=Medicinal Research Reviews|language=en|doi=10.1002/med.21538|pmid=30192413|issn=0198-6325}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Tonddast-Navaei|first2=Sam|last3=Skolnick|first3=Jeffrey|date=September 2017|title=Pocket detection and interaction-weighted ligand-similarity search yields novel high-affinity binders for Myocilin-OLF, a protein implicated in glaucoma|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0960894X1730731X|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry Letters|volume=27|issue=17|pages=4133–4139|doi=10.1016/j.bmcl.2017.07.035|issn=0960-894X|pmc=5568477|pmid=28739043}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Srinivasan|first=Bharath|last2=Zhou|first2=Hongyi|last3=Mitra|first3=Sreyoshi|last4=Skolnick|first4=Jeffrey|date=October 2016|title=Novel small molecule binders of human N-glycanase 1, a key player in the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation pathway|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0968089616306265|journal=Bioorganic &amp; Medicinal Chemistry|volume=24|issue=19|pages=4750–4758|doi=10.1016/j.bmc.2016.08.019|issn=0968-0896|pmc=5015769|pmid=27567076}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gasteiger_2004"&gt;Gasteiger J.(Editor), Engel T.(Editor): ''Chemoinformatics : A Textbook''.

== Applications ==

===Storage and retrieval===
{{main|Chemical database}}
The primary application of cheminformatics is in the storage, indexing and search of information relating to compounds. The efficient search of such stored information includes topics that are dealt with in computer science as [[data mining]], [[information retrieval]], [[information extraction]] and [[machine learning]]. Related research topics include:
* [[Unstructured data]]
**[[Information retrieval]]
**[[Information extraction]]
* [[Structured data mining]] and mining of [[structured data]]
**[[Database mining]]
**[[Graph mining]]
**[[Molecule mining]]
**[[Sequence mining]]
**[[Tree mining]]
*[[Digital libraries]]

==== File formats ====
{{main|Chemical file format}}
The ''in silico'' representation of chemical structures uses specialized formats such as the [[XML]]-based [[Chemical Markup Language]] or [[Simplified molecular input line entry specification|SMILES]].  These representations are often used for storage in large [[chemical database]]s. While some formats are suited for visual representations in 2 or 3 dimensions, others are more suited for studying physical interactions, modeling and docking studies.

=== Virtual libraries ===
Chemical data can pertain to real or virtual molecules.  Virtual libraries of compounds
may be generated in various ways to explore chemical space and hypothesize novel 
compounds with desired properties.

Virtual libraries of classes of compounds (drugs, natural products, diversity-oriented synthetic products) were recently generated using the FOG (fragment optimized growth) algorithm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=FOG: Fragment Optimized Growth Algorithm for the de Novo Generation of Molecules occupying Druglike Chemical | last=Kutchukian | first=Peter  |author2=Lou, David |author3=Shakhnovich, Eugene  |journal=Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling | year=2009 |volume=49 | pages=1630–1642|doi=10.1021/ci9000458|pmid=19527020|issue=7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was done by using cheminformatic tools to train transition probabilities of a [[Markov chain]] on authentic classes of compounds, and then using the Markov chain to generate novel compounds that were similar to the training database.

=== Virtual screening ===
{{main|Virtual screening}}
In contrast to [[high-throughput screening]], virtual screening involves computationally
screening ''[[in silico]]'' libraries of compounds, by means of various methods such as
[[docking (molecular)|docking]], to identify members likely to possess desired properties
such as biological activity against a given target&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;. In some cases, [[combinatorial chemistry]] is used in the development of the library to increase the efficiency in mining the chemical space. More commonly, a diverse library of small molecules or [[natural product]]s is screened.

===Quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR)===
{{main|Quantitative structure–activity relationship}}
This is the calculation of [[quantitative structure–activity relationship]] and [[QSPR|quantitative structure property relationship]] values, used to predict the activity of compounds from their structures. In this context there is also a strong relationship to [[chemometrics]]. Chemical [[expert system]]s are also relevant, since they represent parts of chemical knowledge as an ''[[in silico]]'' representation. There is a relatively new concept of [[matched molecular pair analysis]] or prediction-driven MMPA which is coupled with QSAR model in order to identify activity cliff.&lt;ref name="Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process"&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.jcheminf.com/content/6/1/48/abstract | doi=10.1186/s13321-014-0048-0| pmid=25544551| pmc=4272757| title=Prediction-driven matched molecular pairs to interpret QSARs and aid the molecular optimization process| journal=Journal of Cheminformatics| volume=6| issue=1| pages=48| year=2014| last1=Sushko| first1=Yurii| last2=Novotarskyi| first2=Sergii| last3=Körner| first3=Robert| last4=Vogt| first4=Joachim| last5=Abdelaziz| first5=Ahmed| last6=Tetko| first6=Igor V.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Choosing Wisely Canada''' ('''CWC''') is a Canadian-based health education campaign launched on April 2, 2014 under the leadership of Dr. [[Wendy Levinson]], in partnership with the [[Canadian Medical Association]], and  based at the [[University of Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Lev CMAJ"&gt;Levinson W, Huynh T. Engaging physicians and patients in conversations about unnecessary tests and procedures: Choosing Wisely Canada. CMAJ. 2014 Mar 18;186(5):325-6.&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign aims to help physicians and patients engage in conversations about [[Unnecessary health care|unnecessary tests, treatments and procedures]], and to assist physicians and patients in making informed and effective choices to ensure high quality care.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Medical Association [website]. Choosing Wisely Canada.Ottawa, ON: Canadian Medical Association; 2014. Available from:www.cma.ca/En/Pages/choosing-wisely-canada.aspx.&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign is based on the notion that unnecessary tests, treatments, and procedures often do more harm than good, resulting in poor clinical outcomes and significant waste in the [[Canadian healthcare system]].&lt;ref&gt;Horwitz LI, Masica AL, Auerbach AD. Introducing Choosing Wisely®: Next steps in improving healthcare value. J Hosp Med. 2015 Mar;10(3):187-9&lt;/ref&gt; These unnecessary tests and procedures take away from care by potentially exposing patients to harm, leading to more testing to investigate [[False positives and false negatives|false positive tests]], and contributing to unnecessary anxiety and avoidable costs for patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title =ANDRÉ PICARD: When health care becomes unnecessary care |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/when-health-care-becomes-unnecessary-care/article25486001/}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Choosing Wisely Canada'' aims to encourage and empower physicians to assimilate, evaluate, and implement the ever-increasing amount of evidence on current best practice. The campaign also supports the equally important role of patient education and the need to dispel the false notion that “more care is better care”.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

Central to the campaign are lists of "Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question" developed by more than forty-five Canadian specialty societies. These lists are intended to encourage physicians to adopt a "think twice" attitude to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful tests and procedures, and to foster discussions between patients and physicians about inappropriate care. The campaign also uses patient-friendly education materials to complement these lists, as well as teaches medical trainees about resource stewardship. As of June 2, 2015, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released .

''Choosing Wisely Canada'' leads an international community, made up of nations who are implementing similar programs in their respective countries. At present, this community includes representation from [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], [[United States]] and [[Wales]].

Choosing Wisely Canada stems from worldwide concern around providing unnecessary treatment when the risk of harm exceeds its potential benefit ("medical overuse").&lt;ref&gt;Morgan DJ, Wright SM, Dhruva S. Update on medical overuse. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Jan;175(1):120-4&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of studies have highlighted the prevalence of medical overuse in Canada, which include findings that approximately 50% of prescriptions for respiratory infections in [[Saskatchewan]] are inappropriate,&lt;ref&gt;Wang, E. E., Einarson, T. R., Kellner, J. D., &amp; Conly, J. M. (1999). Antibiotic prescribing for Canadian preschool children: evidence of overprescribing for viral respiratory infections. Clinical infectious diseases, 29(1), 155-160.&lt;/ref&gt; 28% of [[lumbar spine]] [[MRI]]s in [[Alberta]] and [[Ontario]] are unnecessary,&lt;ref&gt;Emery, D. J., Shojania, K. G., Forster, A. J., Mojaverian, N., &amp; Feasby, T. E. (2013). Overuse of magnetic resonance imaging. JAMA Internal Medicine,173(9), 823-825.&lt;/ref&gt;  and 28% of [[bone mineral density]] scans are inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;Papaioannou A, Morin S, Cheung AM, Atkinson S, Brown JP, Feldman S, et al. 2010 clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis and management of osteoporosis in Canada: Summary. CMAJ. 2010 Nov 23;182(17):1864-73.&lt;/ref&gt; These unnecessary invasive procedures and low value care are major causes of preventable harm and increased waste of medical resources.&lt;ref&gt;Berwick, D. M., &amp; Hackbarth, A. D. (2012). Eliminating waste in US health care. Jama, 307(14), 1513-1516.&lt;/ref&gt; Medical overuse has been associated with decreased [[patient satisfaction]] and poor clinical outcomes, including higher mortality.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, E. S., Wennberg, D. E., Stukel, T. A., Gottlieb, D. J., Lucas, F. L., &amp; Pinder, E. L. (2003). The implications of regional variations in Medicare spending. Part 1: the content, quality, and accessibility of care. Annals of Internal Medicine, 138(4), 273-287.&lt;/ref&gt; A systematic survey of patients in seven countries revealed that 10-20% of patients believed that their physicians had provided treatment of little or no value in the past two years.&lt;ref&gt;Schoen, C., Osborn, R., Doty, M. M., Bishop, M., Peugh, J., &amp; Murukutla, N. (2007). Toward higher-performance health systems: adults’ health care experiences in seven countries, 2007. Health Affairs, 26(6), w717-w734.&lt;/ref&gt; Further studies highlighted the financial strain of medical overuse, such as the analysis conducted by the [[Institute of Medicine]], which found that up to 30% of American health care spending is on unnecessary tests and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;Schwartz AL, Landon BE, Elshaug AG, Chernew ME, McWilliams JM. Measuring Low-Value Care in Medicare. JAMA Intern Med. 2014. Epub ahead of print.&lt;/ref&gt; In light of these concerns, Choosing Wisely Canada hopes to optimize value, reduce waste and improve patient outcomes by promoting patient-physician conversations about low-value care.

==History==
[[File:Dr. Wendy Levinson, MD, OC..jpg|thumb|Dr. Wendy Levinson (MD, OC) Chair of Choosing Wisely Canada]]

Choosing Wisely Canada is modeled after the [[Choosing Wisely]] campaign launched by the [[ABIM Foundation]] of the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] in the United States in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey EJ. Choosing wisely (and carefully) Canada. Can J Surg. 2014 Jun;57(3):149, 151.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Wendy Levinson]], a Canadian physician and previous chair of the ABIM Board of Directors, was involved in launching the Choosing Wisely campaign in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, C. D., &amp; Levinson, W. S. (2015). A Commitment to High-Value Care Education From the Internal Medicine Community. Annals of Internal Medicine,162(9), 639-640&lt;/ref&gt; After its successful launch, she decided to bring the movement to Canada and partnered with the [[Canadian Medical Association]] and the [[University of Toronto]] to launch Choosing Wisely Canada on April 2, 2014.&lt;ref name="Lev CMAJ"/&gt; In the first wave of the campaign, nine national medical specialty societies released [[evidence-based]] lists of 41 tests, treatments and procedures that provided no benefit or potentially caused harm to patients.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

Under the leadership of Dr. Wendy Levinson and the Canadian Medical Association, Choosing Wisely Canada initially gained momentum in [[Ontario]] and subsequently became a national movement.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta S, Detsky AS. Development of Choosing Wisely Recommendations for an Inpatient Internal Medicine Service. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Feb 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The second and third waves of physician recommendation lists and patient education materials were launched on October 29, 2014, and June 2, 2015, respectively.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;Vogel, L. More Hospitals Choose Wisely.CMAJ June 8, 2015 cmaj.109-5078&lt;/ref&gt; 
As of June 2, 2015, more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies are engaged and at various stages of recommendations development .  In total, 151 physician recommendations and 26 lay language patient educational materials have been released in the three waves from 2014-2015.&lt;ref name="Vogel" /&gt;

==Campaign==

''Choosing Wisely Canada'' has adopted a multi-faceted campaign approach, engaging physicians, patients, and medical trainees at all levels. The campaign has partnered with more than 45 Canadian medical specialty societies to develop evidence-supported lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question”, hoping to promote conversation about inappropriate care.&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt; The underlying premise is that physicians must lead such conversations, since they determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of resources.&lt;ref name= "Vogel" /&gt; CWC has also developed complementary patient-friendly education materials, and has begun to embed lessons focusing on resource stewardship in undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula.&lt;ref name= "Vogel"/&gt; In order to unify grassroots projects occurring across Canada to implement physician recommendations, CWC additionally developed the Early Adopters Collaborative, which serves as a “learning platform for sharing knowledge, tools and experiences among participating organizations”.&lt;ref name ="ICU"&gt;Holton, E.

=== Physician Recommendations Lists ===

[[File:CWC List Development Process.JPG|thumb|CWC List Development Process]]

At the core of the campaign are lists of "Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question" developed by national specialty societies representing a broad spectrum of physicians. These lists contain tests, treatments or procedures commonly used in their specialty, but which are not supported by evidence, and/or could expose patients to unnecessary harm.&lt;ref&gt;Hurley, R. (2014). Can doctors reduce harmful medical overuse worldwide?. BMJ, 349, g4289.&lt;/ref&gt;

List items recommend practices to be avoided and typically begin with the word “Don’t” or “Avoid”; for example, one of the recommendations released in the first wave of the campaign was ''Don’t order screening chest X-rays and ECGs for asymptomatic or low risk outpatients''.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Association of Radiologists. Medical imaging primer with a focus on x-ray usage and safety [Internet]. [Cited 2014 Feb 15]. Available from: http://www.car.ca/uploads/standards%20guidelines/20130128_en_guide_radiation_primer.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; National specialty societies are free to determine the process for generating their lists, as long as they are done in accordance with the following principles:&lt;ref name= "Lev CMAJ" /&gt;

# The development process is thoroughly documented and publicly available
# Each recommendation is within the specialty’s scope of practice (and not pertaining to other specialties such as family medicine) 
# Tests, treatments or procedures included are those that (a) are frequently used, and, (b) may expose patients to harm or stress.
# Each recommendation is supported by evidence

Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations are not intended to be used to establish payment and coverage decisions. Rather, the lists are meant to spur conversation about what is appropriate and necessary treatment. As each patient situation is unique, Choosing Wisely Canada recommends that its materials be used as guidelines for physicians and patients to determine an appropriate treatment plan together.&lt;ref&gt;Baron RJ, Wolfson D. Advancing medical professionalism and the choosing wisely campaign. JAMA Intern Med. 2015 Mar 1;175(3):464-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Patient education===

In order to encourage patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care, Choosing Wisely Canada uses patient-friendly materials with lay language to complement the lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question”. These patient educational materials are meant to inform patients about the tests, treatments and procedures used within various medical specialties, when they may or may not be necessary, and what patients can do to improve their overall health.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson D, Santa J, Slass L. Engaging physicians and consumers in conversations about treatment overuse and waste: a short history of the choosing wisely campaign. Acad Med. 2014 Jul;89(7):990-5.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one of the patient educational materials released on June 2, 2015, addressed concerns regarding the amount of bed rest required to treat lower back pain, advising that staying in bed longer than 48 hours will not help, and in fact, may actually delay recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Recommendations target overuse of unnecessary medical procedures. BCMJ, Vol. 57, No. 6, July, August 2015, page(s) 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial was written by Dr. Wendy Levinson in ''[[The Toronto Star]]'' as a part of the weekly feature titled "Doctor's Notes".  The article highlighted the Choosing Wisely campaign and encouraged patients to engage in conversations with their physicians about unnecessary care.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thestar.com/life/2015/08/10/why-that-medical-test-might-not-be-necessary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other campaign avenues===

Healthcare stakeholder groups have begun to mobilize around the CWC campaign at provincial and local levels. In Alberta, Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada, multi-stakeholder tables have been established to organize, coordinate and focus provincial implementation efforts.&lt;ref name ="Vogel" /&gt; At the local level, hospitals, health regions and physician groups across the country are working under their own initiative to find innovative ways to put the recommendations into practice.&lt;ref name= "ICU" /&gt; Such local implementation efforts are beginning to emerge across Canada, with activities ranging from physician and patient education, to modifying clinical processes and information systems, to providing data back to providers about their practice patterns.&lt;ref name="WCH"/&gt;

Another major aspect of the campaign is engaging medical trainees at all levels. The Draft 2015 CanMEDS Framework identifies leadership as one of seven essential physician competencies, urging medical professionals to “engage in the stewardship of health care resources”, particularly to “allocate health care resources for optimal patient care” and “to apply evidence and management processes to achieve cost-appropriate care”.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, J. R., Snell, L., &amp; Sherbino, J. (2014). The Draft CanMEDS 2015: Physician Competency Framework. Ottawa: Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada&lt;/ref&gt; In order to embody these ideals, CWC is working with Canadian medical schools to introduce new content focussing on resource stewardship into the undergraduate, postgraduate and continuing medical education curricula.&lt;ref name= "Vogel" /&gt;

On the media front, the campaign includes partnerships with patient organizations and media outlets to develop and disseminate complementary content to increase patient awareness, and to support them in conversations surrounding inappropriate care. CWC has also developed a bilingual mobile app available on both Android and Apple platforms, which contains all physician recommendations and patient educational materials organized categorically.&lt;ref&gt;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.choosingwiselycanada.CWC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/choosing-wisely-canada/id933897108?mt=8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations range from avoiding overuse of broad practices such as unnecessary and potentially harmful screening, diagnostic and radiographic services, to specific tests which are not supported by evidence to improve patient outcomes.

Examples of recommendations which advise against overuse of broad practices include:

* Don’t perform routine [[cancer screening]], or surveillance for a new primary cancer, in the majority of patients with [[metastatic disease]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitera, G., Earle, C., Latosinsky, S., Booth, C., Bezjak, A., Desbiens, C., ... &amp; Porter, G. (2015). Choosing Wisely Canada Cancer List: Ten Low-Value or Harmful Practices That Should Be Avoided In Cancer Care. Journal of Oncology Practice, 11(3), e296-e303.&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Don’t perform annual [[Cardiac imaging|stress cardiac imaging]] or advanced non-invasive imaging as part of routine follow-up in asymptomatic patients.&lt;ref&gt;Natarajan MK, Paul N, Mercuri M, Waller EJ, Leipsic J, Traboulsi M, et al. Canadian Cardiovascular Society position statement on radiation exposure from cardiac imaging and interventional procedures. Can J Cardiol. 2013 Nov;29(11):1361-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of specific low-value tests to avoid in certain circumstances include:

*Don’t order [[testosterone (hormone)|serum testosterone]] in men without symptoms of [[hypogonadism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Endocrine Society. Testosterone Therapy in Adult Men with Androgen Deficiency Syndromes: An Endocrinology Society Clinical Practice Guideline [Internet]. 2010 [cited 2015 Jun 18]. Available from: http://www.endocrine.org/~/media/endosociety/Files/Publications/Clinical%20Practice%20Guidelines/FINAL-Androgens-in-Men-Standalone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*Don’t order [[thrombophilia]] testing in women with early pregnancy loss.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, L. K., Bering, H., Carson, K. R., Haynes, A. E., Kleinerman, J., Kukreti, V., ... &amp; Wood, W. A. (2014). Five hematologic tests and treatments to question. ASH Education Program Book, 2014(1), 599-603&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenges==

Campaign leaders have identified a number of challenges which could potentially undermine the efforts of Choosing Wisely Canada. Since reducing unnecessary tests and procedures may result in lowering healthcare costs, the campaign may be viewed as a [[Health care rationing|cost-cutting or rationing measure]], which could in turn "undermine both physician engagement and patient trust."&lt;ref name ="International"&gt;Levinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the campaign is centered around patient safety with particular emphasis on quality of care. Furthermore, Choosing Wisely Canada recommendations do not determine payment for individual services.&lt;ref name ="International" /&gt;

Some physicians report feeling pressure to engage in defensive medicine (e.g., ordering more tests than necessary) because they feel that it will help them avoid litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Volpp, K. G., Loewenstein, G., &amp; Asch, D. A. (2012). Choosing wisely: low-value services, utilization, and patient cost sharing. Jama, 308(16), 1635-1636.&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian healthcare system is also set up so that specialty physicians get paid for tests and procedures conducted, and not for practicing conservative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Allin, S., &amp; Rudoler, D. (2015). The Canadian Health Care System, 2014.International Profiles of Health Care Systems, 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Such a system may create a pattern for physicians to recommend more treatment. This pattern may also contribute to unwilling of physicians to put recommendations on their lists pertaining specifically to their specialty, instead focusing their recommendations on overuse by other specialties.&lt;ref name ="International" /&gt;

Evaluation of the campaign has also been identified as a major challenge. Campaign leaders concede that measuring the impact of Choosing Wisely is complex and may require multiple approaches, including physician and patient awareness of the campaign, documented curriculum inclusion in medical curricula, and demonstrated reduction in unnecessary testing following campaign efforts.&lt;ref name ="Bhatia"&gt;Bhatia, R. S., Levinson, W., &amp; Lee, D. S. (2014). Low value cardiac testing and Choosing Wisely. BMJ quality &amp; safety, bmjqs-2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring progress of reduction in inappropriate care is particularly complex, since “the definition of appropriateness often includes knowing about symptoms and physical exam findings often not included in electronic health records and administrative databases”.&lt;ref name ="Bhatia" /&gt;  Recognizing the complexity of evaluation efforts, Choosing Wisely Canada along with other international Choosing Wisely movements is working with the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development to develop metrics that might be used to compare countries on specific measures of overuse, as well to develop cross-country metrics.&lt;ref name = "International" /&gt;

Since patient education is a core facet of the campaign, communication with patients presents another challenge. Some campaign recommendations may require clinical education for complete comprehension.&lt;ref name = "Brody"&gt;Brody H. Talking with patients about cost containment. J Gen Intern Med. 2014 Jan;29(1):5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, many patients tend to follow physician recommendations without question, even if they have questions. As such, a major portion of the campaign focuses on encouraging patients to initiate conversations about unnecessary care.&lt;ref name ="Brody" /&gt;  Additionally, Choosing Wisely Canada has developed patient-friendly materials with straightforward, lay language to explain common tests, with a “When you need them and when you don’t” approach. These materials complement the lists of “Five Things Physicians and Patients Should Question” developed by specialty societies.&lt;ref name ="Vogel" /&gt;

}}
The response to Choosing Wisely Canada has been positive, with physicians across the country expressing support for the campaign and highlighting the need for more resource stewardship.&lt;ref name="Glauser"/&gt; Dr. [[Danielle Martin]], family physician and Vice-President Medical Affairs and Health Systems Solutions at [[Women's College Hospital]], lists Choosing Wisely Canada as one of three major ideas to improve Canadian healthcare, highlighting that “Choosing Wisely Canada is not a rationing or cost-cutting exercising. It is about reorganizing healthcare services so we only do things for people that truly benefit their health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Danielle Martin's Three Big Ideas to Improve Healthcare |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/news/simon-fraser-university/Danielle+Martin+three+ideas+transform+health+care/10417270/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Chris Simpson (surgeon)|Chris Simpson]], past president of the Canadian Medical Association, Professor of Medicine and Chief of Cardiology at [[Queen's University]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], notes "Physicians are really embracing the principles behind Choosing Wisely. It’s all about the right thing to do for patients and avoiding the harm that can come from unnecessary testing. Let’s do more of what works and…and less of what is done ‘just in case’. Society expects us to lead the way, and the physicians of Canada intend to do just that”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Choosing Wisely to Avoid Harm |url=http://deptmed.queensu.ca/blog/?p=531}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. [[Rick Glazier]], senior scientist in primary care and population health at the [[Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences]] in [[Toronto]], highlights two aspects of the campaign that he believes are unique and have great potential. “The first”, he states, “is that it’s targeted to the public, and the second is that it’s driven not only by scientists and medical journals, but by the professional organizations themselves. For radiologists to come forward and say you shouldn’t order radiology tests under these circumstances, this is unprecedented”.&lt;ref name= "Glauser"&gt;Glauser W. Choosing Wisely campaign well received. CMAJ. 2014 May 13;186(8):E239-40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The final report of the [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/innovation/index-eng.php Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation] to [[Rona Ambrose]], [[Minister of Health (Canada)]], saluted Choosing Wisely Canada “as an innovative physician-led and patient-centered approach that has the potential to shift healthcare away from a culture of consumption to a focus on appropriateness and quality of care”. Furthermore, the panel urged “governments to support the implementation of [Choosing Wisely Canada] in all jurisdictions and to carefully evaluate its impact”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Report of the Advisory Panel on Healthcare Innovation: "Unleashing Innovation: Excellent Healthcare for Canada" |url= http://www.healthycanadians.gc.ca/publications/health-system-systeme-sante/report-healthcare-innovation-rapport-soins/alt/report-healthcare-innovation-rapport-soins-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to endorsements from eminent physician leaders and professional organizations, Choosing Wisely Canada received positive media coverage in national media sources, including ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Medical Associations to Urge Canada's Doctors to Limit Unnecessary Tests |url= https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health-and-fitness/health/medical-associations-to-urge-canadas-doctors-to-limit-unnecessary-tests/article16953492/}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Unnecessary Medical Tests Need a Rethink |url= http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/unnecessary-medical-tests-need-a-rethink-1.2541790}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toronto Star]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Doctors Weigh in on 2013's Biggest Medical Breakthroughs |url= https://www.thestar.com/life/health_wellness/2013/12/27/doctors_weigh_in_on_2013s_biggest_medical_breakthroughs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; which heralded ''Choosing Wisely Canada'' as one of the top medical breakthroughs of the year. .

On the other hand, early criticism of Choosing Wisely in the United States highlighted that some specialty recommendations addressed overuse of resources by primary care specialties, instead of addressing unnecessary tests and procedures conducted by their own specialty colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Morden, N. E., Colla, C. H., Sequist, T. D., &amp; Rosenthal, M. B. (2014). Choosing wisely—the politics and economics of labeling low-value services.New England Journal of Medicine, 370(7), 589-592&lt;/ref&gt; Choosing Wisely Canada responded to such criticisms by setting guidelines for its list development, which required recommendations put forward by specialty societies to pertain specifically to the specialty’s scope of practice.&lt;ref name= "Bhatia" /&gt;

Many physician bloggers assert that most medical overuse is a result of practicing defensive medicine in an effort to avoid lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Why 'Choosing Wisely' Won't Protect You in a Lawsuit |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/837399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others recognize the noble goal of reducing overuse and harm, but lament that the lists are too simplistic and do not necessarily advance the identification of low-value care, but merely synthesize “agreed-upon, well-established practices”.&lt;ref&gt;Siemens DR, Finelli A. Choosing Wisely Canada: It's our turn. Can Urol Assoc J. 2014 Jul;8(7-8):E580-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

A critique of the Choosing Wisely campaign published in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] by Clement and Charlton highlights a number of shortcomings in the overall movement. While the critique commends the campaign for succeeding in its goal of promoting conversations about low-value care, the authors of the critique believed that the process of list development were based on “quasi-systematic methods that focus on physician participation to increase support”.&lt;ref name ="Clement"&gt;Clement, F., &amp; Charlton, B. (2015). Challenges in Choosing Wisely’s international future: support, evidence, and burnout. JAMA Internal Medicine,175(4), 644-645&lt;/ref&gt; The critique additionally called for increased evidence of the efficacy of the “Top Five” lists in terms of reduction in wasteful practices. Clement and Charlton furthermore warn of “Top Five List Burnout”, noting that when faced with multiple guidelines on a single topic, physicians become confused regarding which protocol to follow.&lt;ref name= "Clement"/&gt; In spite of these criticisms, Clement and Charlton “strongly believe in the global spirit behind the Choosing Wisely campaigns and movement” and “advocate that the priority in 2015 should be thoughtful implementation and rigorous evaluation of existing top five lists” &lt;ref name="Clement" /&gt;

==Impact==

Choosing Wisely Canada has identified a multifaceted evaluation approach to measure its impact, which includes:&lt;ref name= "Bhatia" /&gt;

*Physician attitudes and self-reported experience (through physician surveys)
*Patient receptiveness to campaign messages
*Reduction in ordering of low-value tests and procedures
*Implementation in medical education

Evaluation of campaign impact on patient education and receptiveness included a [[randomized control trial]] entitled EMPOWER (Eliminating Medications Through Patient Ownership of End Results), led by Dr. Cara Tannenbaum, geriatrician and Professor in the Faculties of Medicine and Pharmacy at the [[Université de Montréal]].&lt;ref name ="EMPOWER"&gt;Tannenbaum C, Martin P, Tamblyn R, Benedetti A, Ahmed S. Reduction of inappropriate benzodiazepine prescriptions among older adults through direct patient education: the EMPOWER cluster randomized trial. JAMA Intern Med. 2014 Jun;174(6):890-8.&lt;/ref&gt; The trial recruited more than 300 patients aged 65–95 years in the greater Montréal area who were long term users of benzodiazepines. Approximately half the patients were exposed to educational intervention, which included Choosing Wisely recommendations around excessive benzodiazepine therapy. The patients were then followed for 6 months. The study found that 62% of patients who received the intervention initiated conversation regarding benzodiazepine therapy discontinuation with physicians and/or pharmacists.&lt;ref name ="EMPOWER" /&gt; After six months, 27% of the intervention group had stopped taking benzodiazepines, compared with 5% of the patients who did not receive the educational intervention.&lt;ref name= "EMPOWER" /&gt;

The impact of Choosing Wisely Canada on test ordering and utilization was studied at the [[North York General Hospital]] in the [[Greater Toronto Area]], one of the early adopters of the campaign. A multi-faceted campaign was implemented particularly in the hospital Emergency Department in June, 2014. Test utilization in the Emergency Department was analyzed between September 15 and November 21, 2014, and compared to the same 10-week period in 2013 to account for any seasonal variances.&lt;ref name ="NYGH"&gt;{{cite web|title = CWC in North York General Hospital ED |url= http://www.choosingwiselycanada.org/resources/updates-from-the-field/2014/11/20/north-york-general-hospital-ontario-oct-2014/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study found a 41% decline in the number of laboratory tests ordered pre- and post- CWC program implementation, without any observable change in outcomes.&lt;ref name= "NYGH" /&gt; A preliminary cost analysis revealed annual departmental savings of approximately $215,000 while maintaining the same quality of care.&lt;ref name= "NYGH" /&gt;

A [[quality improvement]] initiative based on CWC principles was launched under the supervision of Dr. [[Danielle Martin]] at the [[Women's College Hospital|Women’s College Hospital]] (WCH) in Toronto. The [[American Thyroid Association]] and Choosing Wisely Canada recommends testing only [[Thyroid-stimulating hormone|Thyroid Stimulating Hormone]] (TSH) levels rather than testing both TSH and [[Thyroid hormones|free thyroid hormones]] (such as T4) for assessment of suspected [[hypothyroidism]], since majority of patients with hypothyroidism will present with abnormal TSH levels. A baseline audit at Women’s College Hospital revealed that 60% of all free thyroid hormones tests were performed in patients who had normal TSH levels, amounting to approximately $50,000 annually in additional laboratory testing expenditure.&lt;ref name ="WCH"&gt;Gilmour, J., Weisman, A., Vecchiarelli, J., Orlov, S., Goldberg, R. J., &amp; Goldberg, A. (2015). THR-191: Reducing Inappropriate Thyroid Function Tests at an Academic Ambulatory Hospital: Baseline Assessment for a Quality Improvement Initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; A “Reflex T4” approach was implemented at WCH, wherein free T4 tests would not be conducted unless TSH levels are abnormal, or if there are clinical indications of situations when measurement of free thyroid hormones would be necessary. When it is found that TSH levels are abnormal, free T4 levels would then be automatically measured.&lt;ref name= "WCH"/&gt; In addition to reducing inappropriate thyroid function testing, the impact of Choosing Wisely Canada is felt through numerous physician and patient awareness campaigns conducted at the hospital.&lt;ref name= "WCH"/&gt;

Medical education efforts of CWC are currently centered at the [[University of Toronto]], where Choosing Wisely principles are integrated into the undergraduate and postgraduate medical curricula through [[Problem-Based Learning]] seminars, lectures, resident research projects and academic half days.&lt;ref&gt;Leon-Carlyle, M., &amp; Srivastava, R. (2014). Medicine’s Push for Resource Stewardship in Education and Practice. University of Toronto Medical Journal,92(2).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the example of Choosing Wisely in the United States and Choosing Wisely Canada, health leaders from [[Australia]], [[Austria]], [[Brazil]], [[Denmark]], [[England]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[South Korea]], [[Switzerland]], and [[Wales]] have committed to initiating similar campaigns revolving around medical stewardship and low-value care in their respective countries. Italy has integrated the principles of Choosing Wisely in a campaign called “Doing more does not mean doing better”, and the Netherlands has launched “Choosing Wisely Netherlands”, both contributing to a growing international Choosing Wisely movement&lt;ref&gt;Levinson W, Kallewaard M, Bhatia RS, Wolfson D, Shortt S, Kerr EA; Choosing Wisely International Working Group. 'Choosing Wisely': a growing international campaign. BMJ Qual Saf. 2015 Feb;24(2):167-74.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) did considerable work over a period of years on the classification of sciences (including [[mathematics]]).&lt;ref&gt;See "Development of Peirce's classification of sciences - three stages: 1889, 1898, 1903" by Tommi Vehkavaara, 2003, {{cite web|url= http://www.uta.fi/~attove/peirce_syst.PDF |title=Eprint }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(19.4&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} and "The outline of Peirce's classification of sciences (1902-1911)" by Tommi Vehkavaara, 2001, {{cite web|url= http://www.uta.fi/~attove/peirce_systems3.PDF |title=Eprint }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(11.4&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; His classifications are of interest both as a map for navigating his philosophy and as an accomplished [[polymath]]'s survey of research in his time. Peirce himself was well grounded and produced work in many research fields, including [[logic]], mathematics, [[statistics]], [[philosophy]], [[spectroscopy]], [[gravimetry]], [[geodesy]], [[chemistry]], and [[experimental psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;Burch, Robert (2001, 2009), "Charles Sanders Peirce", ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/peirce/ Eprint]. Also see Peirce's own list published 1906 in the entry "[[s:Peirce, C(harles) S|Peirce, C(harles) S]]" in v. 2, p. 248, ''American Men of Science'', J. McKern Cattell, ed.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classifications==

Philosophers have done little work on '''classification of the sciences''' and mathematics since Peirce's time. Noting Peirce's "important" contribution, [[Denmark]]'s [[Birger Hjørland]] commented: "There is not today (2005), to my knowledge, any organized research program about the classification of the sciences in any discipline or in any country".{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}&lt;ref&gt;Professor in knowledge orgnanization, library science. See faculty profile [http://www.iva.dk/omiva/medarbejdere/default.asp?cid=683&amp;tid=4 page] {{dead link|date=May 2016}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As Miksa (1998) writes, the "interest for this question largely died in the beginning of the 20th century".&lt;ref&gt;See Hjørland's comments [https://web.archive.org/web/20100324172907/http://www.db.dk/bh/Core%20Concepts%20in%20LIS/articles%20a-z/classification_of_the_sciences.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether Hjørland includes the classification of mathematics in that characterization.

===Taxa===

In 1902 and 1903 Peirce elaborates classifications of the sciences in: 
*"A Detailed Classification of the Sciences" in ''Minute Logic'' (Feb.–Apr. 1902), ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' (CP) v. 1, paragraphs 203–283&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textlog.de/4256.html Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
*July 1902 application to the Carnegie institution (MS L75)&lt;ref&gt;''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"An Outline Classification of the Sciences (CP 1.180-202)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.textlog.de/4257.html Eprint] and [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm  Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; in his "A Syllabus of Certain Topics in Logic" (1903), wherein his classifications of the sciences take more or less their final form

However, only in the "Detailed Classification" and the Carnegie application does he discuss the taxa which he used, which were inspired by the biological taxa of [[Louis Agassiz]].&lt;ref&gt;CP 1.229-230, (from the "Minute Logic", 1902), [http://www.textlog.de/4263.html Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sciences===

In 1902, he divided science into Theoretical and Practical.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), Manuscript L75.355, Application to the Carnegie Institute, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-02.htm Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; Theoretical Science consisted of Science of Discovery and Science of Review, the latter of which he also called "Synthetic Philosophy", a name taken from the title of the vast work, written over many years, by [[Herbert Spencer]]. Then, in 1903, he made it a three-way division: Science of Discovery, Science of Review, and Practical Science.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), CP 1.181, [http://www.textlog.de/4257.html Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1903 he characterized Science of Review as:&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1903), CP 1.182 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm  Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...arranging the results of discovery, beginning with digests, and going on to endeavor to form a philosophy of science. Such is the nature of [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]'s ''[[Alexander Von Humboldt#The .22Cosmos.22|Cosmos]]'', of [[Auguste Comte|Comte]]'s ''Philosophie positive'', and of [[Herbert Spencer|Spencer]]'s ''Synthetic Philosophy''. The classification of the sciences belongs to this department.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Peirce had already for a while divided the Sciences of Discovery into:
:(1) Mathematics – draws necessary conclusions about hypothetical objects
:(2) Cenoscopy – philosophy about positive phenomena in general, such as confront a person at every waking moment, rather than special classes, and not settling theoretical issues by special experiences or experiments&lt;ref name=Bentham&gt;Peirce borrows the terms "cenoscopy" and "idioscopy" from [[Jeremy Bentham]]. See Peirce: (1902) CP 1.239-241; (1903) CP 1.183-187; (c. 1903) CP 6.6; and (1905) CP 8.199.&lt;/ref&gt;
:(3) Idioscopy – the special sciences, about special classes of positive phenomena, and settling theoretical issues by special experiences or experiments&lt;ref name=Bentham/&gt;
Thus Peirce ends up framing two fields each of which is philosophy in a sense: cenoscopic philosophy which precedes the special sciences, and synthetic philosophy (that is to say, science of review), which does take advantage of the results of all the sciences of discovery and develops, for instance, classifications of the sciences.

Peirce opens his 1903 classification (the "Syllabus" classification) with a concise statement of method and purpose:&lt;ref&gt;The ''Collected Peirce'' (CP), v. 1, paragraph 180 [https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm  Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;This classification, which aims to base itself on the principal affinities of the objects classified, is concerned not with all possible sciences, nor with so many branches of knowledge, but with sciences in their present condition, as so many businesses of groups of living men. It borrows its idea from Comte's classification; namely, the idea that one science depends upon another for fundamental principles, but does not furnish such principles to that other. It turns out that in most cases the divisions are trichotomic; the First of the three members relating to universal elements or laws, the Second arranging classes of forms and seeking to bring them under universal laws, the Third going into the utmost detail, describing individual phenomena and endeavoring to explain them. But not all the divisions are of this character....&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The following table is based mostly on Peirce's 1903 classification, which was more or less the final form. But see after the table for discussion of his later remarks on the divisions of logic.

====Logic's divisions later====

In a piece which the ''Collected Papers'' editors called "Phaneroscopy" and dated as 1906, Peirce wrote (CP 4.9):&lt;ref&gt;A fuller version of the quote is at Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/stecheotic.html Stecheotic, Stoicheiology].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|...I extend logic to embrace all the necessary principles of semeiotic, and I recognize a logic of icons, and a logic of indices, as well as a logic of symbols; and in this last I recognize three divisions: ''Stecheotic'' (or stoicheiology), which I formerly called Speculative Grammar; ''Critic'', which I formerly called Logic; and ''Methodeutic'', which I formerly called Speculative Rhetoric}}
Thus the three main 1903 departments of logic were now sub-departments of the study of the logic of symbols.

In a letter to J. H. Kehler, printed in ''The New Elements of Mathematics'' v.3, p.&amp;nbsp;207 and dated 1911,&lt;ref&gt;It can be viewed at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'' under [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/analytic.html Analytic].&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce wrote:
{{quote|I have now sketched my doctrine of Logical Critic, skipping a good deal. I recognize two other parts of Logic. One which may be called Analytic examines the nature of thought, not psychologically but simply to define what it is to doubt, to believe, to learn, etc., and then to base critic  on these definitions is my real method, though in this letter I have taken the third branch of logic, Methodeutic, which shows how to conduct an inquiry. This is what the greater part of my life has been devoted to, though I base it upon Critic.}}

Methodeutic &lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; (methods of inquiry). ||Peirce in 1906: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Logic. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. Logic of icons. &lt;br&gt;B. Logic of indices. &lt;br&gt;C.

|}
There in 1911 Peirce does not mention the 1906 division into logics of icons, indices and symbols. Critic and Methodeutic appear, as in 1902 and 1903, as the second and third main departments of logic. Analytic is now the first department and the word "Stechiology" goes unused. He includes in Analytic the consideration of issues which, back in his 1902 Carnegie Institute application, he had discussed in sections on logic with headings such as "Presuppositions of Logic"&lt;ref&gt;Memoir 10. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; and "On the Logical Conception of Mind"&lt;ref&gt;Memoir 11. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; that he had placed before the sections on logic's departments (stechiology, critic, and methodeutic).&lt;ref&gt;Memoir 13. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m13 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

On the question of the relationship between Stechiology and the Analytic that seems to have replaced it, note that, in Draft D of Memoir 15 in his 1902 Carnegie Institute application, Peirce said that stechiology, also called ''{{lang|la|grammatica speculativa}}'', amounts to an ''{{lang|de|Erkenntnisslehre}}'', a theory of cognition, provided that that theory is stripped of matter irrelevant and inadmissible in philosophical logic, irrelevant matter such as all truths (for example, the association of ideas) established by psychologists, insofar as the special science of psychology depends on logic, not vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-06.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; In that same Carnegie Institute application as in many other places, Peirce treated belief and doubt as issues of philosophical logic apart from psychology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3053">[[File:Corporate Design of Kehrsatz.svg|thumb|220px|Corporate design of the City council of [[Kehrsatz]]]]
A '''corporate design''' (CD) is the official graphical [[design]] of the [[logo]] and name of a [[company]] or institution used on [[letterhead]]s, envelopes, forms, folders, [[brochure]]s, etc. The [[Corporate identity|house style]] is created in such a way that all the elements are arranged in a distinctive design and pattern.

This includes dictating what ink [[pantone]]s should be used in the coloring, and what [[typeface]]s.

Governments may have corporate designs as well. On June 2, 1999, the German federal cabinet introduced a corporate design for the flag of Germany.&lt;ref name="design-literatur"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |title=Primärfarben |work=Corporate Design Documentation |author=Federal Government of Germany |date=17 December 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-26 |language=de |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915085300/http://styleguide.bundesregierung.de/Webs/SG/DE/Print-Styleguide/Basiselemente/Farben/Primaerfarben/primaerfarben.html |archivedate=15 September 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'corporate design' is not the name of a specific design profession.

Corporations do have special design needs based on their behaviors. They communicate their mission, objectives, needs, and product information -- with users, clients, or members; with suppliers, distributors, service providers; with the surrounding community and the media; with financial institutions and other corporations, and with the state. They create, acquire, modify, organize and distribute large amounts of information and raw data, as well as goods and services. (Sometimes the goods or services are themselves information. For example, ''The Yellow Pages'', or ''The New York Times''.)

A designer whose client is a corporation will include the logo and other elements of the corporate brand as a way to standardize and unify all communication between company and audience, whether in print or online. Scenarios that includes human-computer interactions take place through software and hardware user interfaces that are also branded and designed with the [[corporate culture]] in mind. (Examples of user scenarios: update the Web site, transfer funds, document procedures, control security, operate machinery, plan projects, conduct virtual meetings, check inventory, fill an order, or ship a product.)

These interactions are increasingly taking place through Web sites, through mobile devices and at dedicated terminals, and may include sound, video, animation and user feedback mechanisms. A savvy designer will create designs that can be adapted to all of these applications.

The '''''Dashboard of Sustainability''''' is a free-of-charge, non-commercial software package configured to convey the complex relationships among economic, social, and environmental issues.
The software is designed to help developing countries achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]] and work towards [[sustainable development]]. The software package was developed by members of the Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators (CGSDI),&lt;ref&gt;Consultative Group on Sustainable Development Indicators.  (2006)  ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/dashboard.asp Dashboard of Sustainability.]''; see also ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp CGSDI history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106123832/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/history.asp |date=2007-01-06 }}'' and ''[http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp CGSDI members] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224102435/http://www.iisd.org/cgsdi/members.asp |date=2007-02-24 }}'', all obtained Apr. 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been applied to quite a number of indicator sets, inter alia to the Millennium Development Goals indicators and the United Nations [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] indicators.

In 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability researchers Jochen Jesinghaus and Peter Hardi presented the Dashboard of Sustainability at the [[Earth Summit 2002|Johannesburg Summit]]&lt;ref&gt;IISD Earth Negotiations Bulletin (ENB) ''[http://www.iisd.ca/2002/wssd/enbots/aug30.html ENB on the side, Aug. 30, 2002]'' obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and the 2002 [[World Social Forum]] in [[Porto Alegre]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranjit Devraj (TerraViva), ''[http://ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml Internet Dashboard Device for Navigating Development] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070411090712/http://www.ipsnews.net/terraviva/05_dashboard.shtml |date=2007-04-11 }}'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It was also included in the resources for the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]] World Forum on Key Indicators.&lt;ref&gt;OECD (2004), ''[http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,2340,en_21571361_31834434_33637186_1_1_1_1,00.html European Union 2002, Dashboard of Sustainability]'', obtained Apr. 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, the Millennium Project utilized the Dashboard of Sustainability to conclude in their [[State of the Future]] report that global prospects for improving the overall health, wealth, and sustainability of humanity are improving, but slowly.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C.; Gordon, Theodore J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3649">'''Development ethics''' is a field of enquiry that reflects on both the ends and the means of [[economic development]]. It typically takes a normative stance, asking and answering questions about the nature of ethically desirable development and what ethics means for achieving development, and discusses various ethical dilemmas that the practice of development has led to. Its aim is to ensure that "value issues" are an important part of the discourse of development.&lt;ref name="IDEA new"&gt;[http://developmentethics.org/what-is-development-ethics/] International Development Ethics Association. What is Development Ethics &lt;/ref&gt;

== Key themes ==
Development ethics typically looks at development theories and practice and their relationships with:
* Social justice
* Human rights
* Basic needs

A major focus of the literature is on the "ethics of the means". This involves asking not only how to realize the goals of development but also what are ethical limits in their pursuit.&lt;ref name="IDEA new" /&gt;

[[Denis Goulet]], one of the founding fathers of the discipline, argued in ''The Cruel Choice'' (1971) that     "Development ethics is useless unless it can be translated into public action. By public action is meant action taken by public authority, as well as actions taken by private agents by having important consequences for the life of the public community. The central question is: How can moral guidelines influence decisions of those who hold power?"&lt;ref&gt;Goulet, Denis (1971), ''The Cruel Choice''&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source needed|date=September 2018}}

'''Elocution''' is the study of formal speaking in [[pronunciation]], [[grammar]], style, and [[tone (linguistics)|tone]].

==History==
In Western classical [[rhetoric]], elocution was one of the five core disciplines of [[pronunciation]], which was the art of delivering speeches. Orators were trained not only on proper [[diction]], but on the proper use of gestures, stance, and dress. (Another area of rhetoric, [[elocutio]], was unrelated to ''elocution'' and, instead, concerned the style of writing proper to discourse.)

Elocution emerged as a formal discipline during the eighteenth century. One of its important figures was [[Thomas Sheridan (actor)|Thomas Sheridan]], actor and father of [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]].  Thomas Sheridan's lectures on elocution, collected in ''Lectures on Elocution'' (1762) and his ''Lectures on Reading'' (1775), provided directions for marking and reading aloud passages from literature. Another actor, John Walker, published his two-volume ''Elements of Elocution'' in 1781, which provided detailed instruction on voice control, gestures, pronunciation, and emphasis.

With the publication of these works and similar ones, elocution gained wider public interest. While training on proper speaking had been an important part of private education for many centuries, the rise in the nineteenth century of a middle class in Western countries (and the corresponding rise of public education) led to great interest in the teaching of elocution, and it became a staple of the school curriculum. American students of elocution drew selections from what were popularly deemed "Speakers." By the end of the century, several Speaker texts circulated throughout the United States, including McGuffey's ''New Juvenile Speaker'', the ''Manual of Elocution and Reading'', the ''Star Speaker'', and the popular ''Delsarte Speaker''. Some of these texts even included pictorial depictions of body movements and gestures to augment written descriptions.

The era of the elocution movement, defined by the likes of Sheridan and Walker, evolved in the early and mid-1800's into what is called the scientific movement of elocution, defined in the early period by James Rush's ''The Philosophy of the Human Voice'' (1827) and [[Richard Whately]]'s ''Elements of Rhetoric'' (1828), and in the later period by [[Alexander Melville Bell]]'s ''A New Elucidation of Principles of Elocution'' (1849) and ''Visible Speech'' (1867).

In her recent book ''The Elocutionists: Women, Music, and the Spoken Word'' (University of Illinois Press, 2017), [[Marian Wilson Kimber]] addresses the oft-forgotten, female-dominated genre of elocution set to musical accompaniment in the United States.

==Sample curriculum==

An example of this can be seen in the Table of Contents of [[McGuffey Readers|McGuffey's ''New Sixth Eclectic Reader'']] of 1857:

:Principles of Elocution
::I. Articulation
::II. Inflections
::III. Accent and Emphasis
::IV. Instructions for Reading Verse
::V. The Voice
::VI. Gesture

:''New Sixth Reader''. Exercises in Articulation
::Exercise I. &amp;mdash; The Grotto of Antiparos
::Exercise II. &amp;mdash; The Thunder Storm
::Exercise III. &amp;mdash; Description of a Storm
::IV. Hymn to the Night-Wind

'''Environmental consulting''' is often a form of [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] [[Consultant|consulting]], in which the consultant ensures that the client maintains an appropriate measure of compliance with [[environmental regulation]]s. There are many types of environmental consultants, but the two main groups are those who enter the field from the industry side, and those who enter the field from the [[environmentalist]] side.

Environmental consultants work in a very wide variety of fields. Whether it be providing [[construction]] services such as [[Asbestos]] Hazard Assessments or Lead Hazard Assessments or conducting due [[diligence]] reports for customers to rid them of possible sanctions. Consultancies may generalize across a wide range of disciplines or specialize in certain areas of environmental consultancy such as [[waste management]].

Environmental consultants usually have an [[undergraduate degree]] and sometimes even [[master's degree]] in [[Environmental Engineering]], [[Environmental Science]], [[Environmental Studies]], [[Geology]], or some other science discipline. They should have deep knowledge on environmental regulations, which they can advise particular clients in the private industry or public government institutions to help them steer clear of possible fines, legal action or misguided transactions.

Environmental consulting spans a wide spectrum of industry. The most basic industry that environmental consulting remains prominent in is the commercial estate market. Many commercial lenders rely on both small and large environmental firms. Many commercial lenders will not lend monies to borrowers if the property or personal capital does not exceed the worth of the land. If an environmental problem is discovered property owners that deem themselves a responsible party will most likely reserve monies in escrow in order to resolve the environmental impact.

With increasing numbers of construction, [[agriculture]], and scientific companies employing environmental consultancies, the industry can expect growth in the vicinity of 9.7 percent in 2008, amidst mounting public concern over [[environmental degradation]] and climate change. And while some companies are genuinely motivated by concern for the environment, for others, hiring consultants to appear to be "going green" has proven to be a useful marketing tool. Growing government funding into renewable energy and technologies producing low emissions is also helping growth, as organizations investing in research and development in these areas are often major employers of environmental consultants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-4/ The Recession List - Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl... (or growth together with growth inNorth A...)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==

There are numerous areas in which environmental consultants might work (in no particular order):

'''Contaminated Land''' is one area as mentioned above. [[Contaminated land|Contaminated Land]] this may well involve a [[Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment]]

'''Energy''' may entail feasibility studies for renewable energy projects. For example, a study may attempt to answer the question: Would a micro-hydro-generation scheme pay for itself over the course of its operational life?

'''Geotechnical''' may also be covered by Environmental Consultants, this might include activities such as [[site investigation]]s, geotechnical engineering (foundation design, slope stability), and restoration [[quality assurance]].

'''Environmental Management Systems''' such as [[ISO 14001]] are large complicated systems that are often not implemented using internal man/woman power. This work is usually outsourced to consultants.

'''Green Claims''' Environmental Consultants may be employed to substantiate green claims, such as eco labels, which may involve work on supply chain or embodied carbon.

'''Compliance''' As governments become more and more environmental in their thinking, so does their legal framework. In the UK, businesses are covered by numerous pieces of legislation such as oil storage regulations and The Environment Act. If they are found to be in breach of these regulations they may face severe civil or criminal actions. Environmental Consultants can check to see that the business in question is in compliance with current legislation.

'''Impact Assessment''' see [[Environmental impact statement]]

'''[[Flood risk assessment|Flood Risk]]''', the most common of which may be a Phase 1 Screening Study.

'''[[Asbestos]] Management'''

'''[[Radon]]'''

'''Carbon''' there are various aspects of a company's carbon foot print that may be managed by consultants. They may have internal reduction strategies, or they may be tied in with national targets. Emissions trading is also an important aspect of Carbon Management.

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Environmental journalism''' is the collection, verification, production, distribution and exhibition of information regarding current events, trends, issues and people that are associated with the non-human world with which humans necessarily interact.  To be an environmental journalist, one must have an understanding of scientific language and practice, knowledge of historical environmental events, the ability to keep abreast of environmental policy decisions and the work of environmental organizations, a general understanding of current environmental concerns, and the ability to communicate all of that information to the public in such a way that it can be easily understood, despite its complexity.

Environmental journalism falls within the scope of [[environmental communication]], and its roots can be traced to [[nature writing]].  One key controversy in environmental journalism is a continuing disagreement over how to distinguish it from its allied genres and disciplines.

== History ==

While the practice of nature writing has a rich history that dates back at least as far as the [[exploration narratives]] of [[Christopher Columbus]], and follows tradition up through prominent nature writers like [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[Henry David Thoreau]] in the late 19th century, [[John Burroughs]] and [[John Muir]] in the early 20th century, and [[Aldo Leopold]] in the 1940s, the field of environmental journalism did not begin to take shape until the 1960s and 1970s.

The growth of environmental journalism as a profession roughly parallels that of the environmental movement, which became a mainstream cultural movement with the publication of [[Rachel Carson]]'s ''Silent Spring'' in 1962 and was further legitimized by the passage of the [[Wilderness Act]] in 1964.  Grassroots environmental organizations made a booming appearance on the political scene in the 1960s and 1970s, raising public awareness of what many considered to be the "environmental crisis", and working to influence [[environmental policy]] decisions.  The mass media has followed and generated public interest on environmental issues ever since.

The field of environmental journalism was further legitimized by the creation of the [[Society of Environmental Journalists]] [http://www.sej.org] in 1990, whose mission "is to advance public understanding of environmental issues by improving the quality, accuracy, and visibility of environmental reporting."   Today, academic programs are offered at a number of institutions to train budding journalists in the rigors, complexity and sheer breadth of environmental journalism.

==Advocacy debate==

There exists a minor rift in the community of environmental journalists.  Some, including those in the Society of Environmental Journalists, believe in objectively reporting environmental news, while others, like Michael Frome, a prominent figure in the field, believe that journalists should only enter the environmental side of the field if saving the planet is a personal passion, and that environmental journalists should not shy away from environmental advocacy, though not at the expense of clearly relating facts and opinions on all sides of an issue.   This debate is not likely to be settled soon, but with changes in the field of journalism filtering up from new media being used by the general public to produce news, it seems likely that the field of environmental journalism will lend itself more and more toward reporting points of view akin to environmental advocacy.

==Genres==
{{See also|Environmental Media Awards|The British Environment and Media Awards|List of environmental books}}

=== Environmental communication ===
{{main|Environmental communication}}
Environmental communication is all of the forms of communication that are engaged with the social debate about environmental issues and problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://theieca.org/|title=What is Environmental Communication?|author=Meisner, Mark|publisher=Environmental Communication Network|accessdate=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also within the scope of environmental communication are the genres of [[nature writing]], science writing, environmental literature, environmental interpretation and environmental advocacy.  While there is a great deal of overlap among the various genres within environmental communication, they are each deserving of their own definition.

===Nature writing===
{{Main|Nature writing}}

Nature writing is the genre with the longest history in environmental communication. In his book, ''This Incomparable Land: A Guide to American Nature Writing'', Thomas J. Lyon attempts to use a "taxonomy of nature writing" in order to define the genre.  He suggests that his classifications, too, suffer a great deal of overlap and intergrading. "The literature of nature has three main dimensions to it: natural history information, personal responses to nature, and philosophical interpretation of nature" (Lyon 20). In the natural history essay, "the main burden of the writing is to convey pointed instruction in the facts of nature," such as with the ramble-type nature writing of John Burroughs (Lyon 21). "In essays of experience, the author's firsthand contact with nature is the frame for the writing," as with Edward Abbey's contemplation of a desert sunset (Lyon 23). In the philosophical interpretation of nature, the content is similar to that of the natural history and personal experience essays, "but the mode of presentation tends to be more abstract and scholarly" (Lyon 25). ''The Norton Book of Nature Writing'' adds a few new dimensions to the genre of nature writing, including animal narratives, garden essays, farming essays, ecofeminist works, writing on environmental justice, and works advocating environmental preservation, sustainability and biological diversity.  Environmental journalism pulls from the tradition and scope of nature writing.

===Science writing===
{{See also|Popular science}}

Science writing is writing that focuses specifically on topics of scientific study, generally translating jargon that is difficult for those outside a particular scientific field to understand into language that is easily digestible.  This genre can be narrative or informative.  Not all science writing falls within the bounds of environmental communication, only science writing that takes on topics relevant to the environment. Environmental journalism also pulls from the tradition and scope of science writing.

===Environmental interpretation===
{{See also|Heritage interpretation}}

Environmental interpretation is a particular format for the communication of relevant information.  It "involves translating the technical language of a natural science or related field into terms and ideas that people who aren't scientists can readily understand.  And it involves doing it in a way that's entertaining and interesting to these people" (Ham 3). Environmental interpretation is pleasurable (to engage an audience in the topic and inspire them to learn more about it), relevant (meaningful and personal to the audience so that they have an intrinsic reason to learn more about the topic), organized (easy to follow and structured so that main points are likely to be remembered) and thematic (the information is related to a specific, repetitious message) (Ham 8–28). While environmental journalism is not derived from environmental interpretation, it can employ interpretive techniques to explain difficult concepts to its audience.

===Environmental literature===
{{see also|Outdoor literature}}
Environmental literature is writing that comments intelligently on environmental themes, particularly as applied to the relationships between man, society and the environment.  Most nature writing and some science writing falls within the scope of environmental literature.  Often, environmental literature is understood to espouse care and concern for the environment, thus advocating a more thoughtful and ecologically sensitive relationship of man to nature.  Environmental journalism is partially derived from environmental literature

===Environmental advocacy===
{{See also|Environmentalism}}

Environmental advocacy is presenting information on nature and environmental issues that is decidedly opinionated and encourages its audience to adopt more environmentally sensitive attitudes, often more biocentric worldviews.  Environmental advocacy can be present in any of the aforementioned genres of environmental communication.  It is currently debated whether environmental journalism should employ techniques of environmental advocacy.

==Topics==

The field of environmental journalism covers a wide variety of topics.  According to ''The Reporter's Environmental Handbook'', environmental journalists perceive water concerns as the most important environmental issue, followed by atmospheric air pollution concerns, endocrine disruptors, and waste management issues.  The journalists surveyed were more likely to prioritize specific, local environmental issues than global environmental concerns.

Environmental journalism can include, but is not limited to, some of the following topics:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8958">'''Erik Adigard des Gautries''' (1953) is a [[Graphic designer|communication designer]], multimedia artist and educator based in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. A co-founder of M-A-D, a [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]-based design firm. He is a former design contributor to [[Wired magazine]].

== Biography ==
Adigard was born in [[Republic of the Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/Erik_Adigard|title=Erik Adigard|website=SFMOMA|access-date=2016-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; where his father was stationed as a French foreign correspondent. His grandfather is {{ill|Jean Adigard des Gautries|fr}}, a noted historian and a Legion of Honour recipient. When Adigard was ten his family returned to Paris. He began his university studies in English Literature, Semiotics, and Fine Arts in France before coming to the United States to obtain a BFA (1987) in Graphic Design at California College of the Arts (CCA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cca.edu/|title=California College of the Arts|website=cca.edu|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a student, Adigard's first designs earned him national awards for their experimental mix of iconography and offset printing techniques. Upon graduation, with [[Patricia McShane]], he established M-A-D—also known as "madxs", a brand and communications design studio. Since creating his first digital images for Macworld magazine in 1989 he has been exploring the limits of the graphic design discipline as it continues to be redefined by shifting relationships with technology and social phenomena. His activities range from branding, print, web, video and multimedia, to consulting and exhibits—always with a concern for conceptual accuracy and creative innovation. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

In 1992 he participated in the launch of Wired magazine by conceiving its first visual essay, and then continued to develop a visual vernacular specific to Wired and often labeled "Wired look". In 1996-1998 he served as design director for WiredVentures where he designed new web offerings, including the Hotbot search engine, WiredNews and the ground breaking LiveWired.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

His short documentary, ''Webdreamer'', a portrait of fellow web designers, was featured in international film festivals such as [[RESFest|RESfest]] and the Sundance Film Festival.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In 1999 he co-authored ''Architecture Must Burn'' with Aaron Betsky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://www.amazon.com/Architecture-Must-Burn-Manifestoes-Future/dp/1584230304/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1358198560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=architecture+must+burn|title = Architecture Must Burn Manifestoes for the Future of Architecture|last = Betsky|first = Aaron|last2 = Adigard|first2 = Erik|date = 2001-08-01|publisher = Gingko Press|isbn = 9781584230304|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2000 until 2004 Adigard developed brand strategy for IBM software, creating a graphic system that allowed for five distinct brands; [[IBM DB2|DB2]], Lotus, Tivoli, [[Rational Software|Rational]], and [[IBM WebSphere|Websphere]], to combine into an integrated offering. This brand system included a visual campaign that was in continual use throughout the decade.{{Citation needed|date = April 2016}}

'''Erotic furniture''', also known as '''sex furniture''', is any form of [[furniture]] that can act as an aid to [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]]. While almost anything can be used for this purpose, the most common form of furniture employed for sexual activity is the [[bed (furniture)|bed]], but couches and sofas come a close second. These are not strictly [[Eroticism|erotic]] furniture, as their primary use is not erotic.
[[File:Spanking Bench.png|thumb|250px|A ''spanking bench'']]
Specifically designed furniture for erotic purposes can include
* Devices for [[erotic spanking|spanking]] and [[flagellation]] such as the [[Berkley Horse]]
* [[Sex swing]]s
* Sex Gliders
* Devices for using gravity to aid in lovemaking without the use of complicated slings.
* [[Fisting sling]]s
* Various types of angled foam wedges or specially designed pillows that support various [[sex position]]s.  See [[Liberator shapes]] for example or the ergonomically based Lovebumpers.
* [[Bondage (BDSM)|Bondage]] equipment such as [[stocks]] and [[pillory|pillories]]
* [[Smotherbox]]es and other [[queening stool]]s.
* The Love Chair, a curious chair made of curved [[tubular steel]], articulated in several ways and designed to facilitate otherwise impossible sexual acts. This device was advertised in men's magazines in the mid-1970s, and is seen in at least one of [[Nina Hartley]]'s ''Guide to'' videos, but it is no longer commercially available.
[[File:Spanking on Bondage Furniture.png|thumb|left|A woman is spanked, while kneeling on a specially-made bench for the purpose.]]
* Sawhorses, which are shaped much like the version used for carpentry, but have a sharpened edge and are primarily sat on to achieve a feeling similar to a crotch rope in bondage.

[[King Edward VII of the United Kingdom]], who was heavily overweight, used a specially constructed "love seat" (''siege d'amour'') when he visited the famous [[brothel]], [[Le Chabanais]] in Paris. The piece still exists and a replica&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/28193/trail-edward-vii%E2%80%99s-sex-chair-threesomes|title=On the trail of Edward VII’s sex chair for threesomes|work=The Week UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; is exhibited at the [[Museum of Eroticism|Musée de l'Erotisme]] in [[Quartier Pigalle|Pigalle]].&lt;ref&gt;Dirty Bertie's seat of pleasure, ''[[The Times]]'', 17 January 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Gorey]]'s ''[[The Curious Sofa]]'', (1961), a neo-Victorian pseudo-porno send-up consisting of non-illustrations—there's always a potted palm or something in the way. One caption reads "That evening in the library Scylla, one of the guests who had certain anatomical peculiarities, demonstrated the 'Lithuanian Typewriter', assisted by Ronald and Rupert, two remarkably well-set-up young men from the village." The Curious Sofa of the title is approached with some misgivings by the house-party guests at the end.

The '''Global Strategic Trends Programme''' was established in 2001 to research and forecast potential trends that shape and inform the future strategic context.  It is published by the [[Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre]] (DCDC) which is under the UK's [[Joint Forces Command]] and based in [[Shrivenham]], [[Wiltshire]].

One of the main findings of "Global Strategic Trends out to 2040" is that the era out to 2040 will be a time of transition, characterised by instability both in the relations between states, and in the relations between groups within states.  During this timeframe significant global trends will include; climate change, rapid population growth, resource scarcity, a resurgence in ideology and a shift in global power from West to East.  The struggle to establish an effective system of global governance, is likely to be a central theme of the era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/33717/GST4_v9_Feb10.pdf|title=Global Strategic Trends Out to 2040|publisher=Development, Concepts and Doctrine Centre|accessdate=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent Mentions of Global Strategic Trends==

The analysis conducted in Global Strategic Trends was recently highlighted in the UK Public Administration Select Committee Report on Who does UK National Strategy?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmselect/cmpubadm/435/435.pdf |title=UK Public Administration Select Committee Report on ''Who does UK National Strategy?''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comments included:

'''Professor Peter Hennessy''' - "''You have to have as a good a system for horizon scanning as you possibly can, with all the necessary caveats. For example, we haven’t talked about it yet, but the one that I find the most helpful was an institutionalisation of something that was done in the last defence review, the DCDC people at Shrivenham, the “Shrivenham Scans” as I call them, I find them absolutely fascinating...
''...they produced a very good one [scan], the bulk of which was made public in time for this review and, as far as I can see, it’s having no salience at all in the way the SDSR is being cut—yet another example of an own goal and being less than the sum of our parts. But I’m not defeatist in the way that you might—I suspect you’re teasing me on this because you’re not an opt out of the world man either, are you? It’s not for me to ask you questions."''''

'''Professor Hew Strachan''' - ''"Strategic trends stress those things that are likely to happen to the world, but not much of what they do really focuses on what the United Kingdom is trying to do. It’s extraordinary that DCDC is at Shrivenham, at that distance, (quite apart from the other things that have happened to it), rather than in London and central to the processes that we’re talking about. Professor Hennessy mentioned just now the publication last year of a document called “The Future Character of Conflict”, which was designed to address precisely what its title says, but its arguments are nowhere evident in current thinking in relation to strategy, let alone in relation to the Strategic Defence and Security Review."''

'''Mr Tom Mckane (Director Strategy MOD)''' - ''"As to how these documents are produced, within the department we have the benefit of the Development Concepts and Doctrine Centre, who produce long range views of the world. Their document “Global Strategic Trends” I think you are familiar with. That type of document feeds into the work of the staff at the centre of the department who are responsible for assisting ministers and the Defence Board to think about defence strategy."''

'''Recommendation in Written evidence submitted by Professor Julien Lindley-French - '''"''Cross-government structures under the NSC/Cabinet Office should ideally include a Strategy Group made up of both officials and non-government experts to build on the Stratefic Trends work of DCDC with a specific remit to establish likely forecasts and context for Intelligence and Planning."''

'''Cultural heritage tourism''' (or just '''heritage tourism''' or '''diaspora tourism''') is a branch of [[tourism]] oriented towards the [[cultural heritage]] of the location where tourism is occurring. 

The [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] in the United States defines heritage tourism as "traveling to experience the places, artifacts and activities that authentically represent the stories and people of the past",&lt;ref name="nthp"&gt;{{cite web|title=Heritage Tourism|url=http://www.preservationnation.org/information-center/economics-of-revitalization/heritage-tourism/#.Uz7tU1flvqE|publisher=National Trust for Historic Preservation|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "heritage tourism can include cultural, historic and natural resources".&lt;ref name="nthp"/&gt;

==Culture==
[[Culture]] has always been a major object of travel, as the development of the [[Grand Tour]] from the 16th century onwards attests. In the 20th century, some people have claimed, culture ceased to be the objective of tourism: tourism is now culture. Cultural attractions play an important role in tourism at all levels, from the global highlights of world culture to attractions that underpin local identities. (Richards, 1996)&lt;ref name="Richards"&gt;{{cite book |last= Richards |first= Greg |title= Production and consumption of European Cultural Tourism. Annals of Tourism Research | page = |year= 1996 |publisher= Tillburg University Press |location= |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Weiler and Hall, culture, heritage and the arts have long contributed to appeal of tourist destination. However, in recent years 'culture' has been rediscovered as an important marketing tool to attract those travellers with special interests in heritage and arts. 

According to the Hollinshead, cultural heritage tourism defines as cultural heritage tourism is the fastest growing segment of the tourism industry because there is a trend toward an increase specialization among tourists. This trend is evident in the rise in the volume of tourists who seek adventure, culture, history, [[archaeology]] and interaction with local people.

Cultural heritage tourism is important for various reasons; it has a positive economic and social impact, it establishes and reinforces identity, it helps preserve the cultural heritage, with culture as an instrument it facilitates harmony and understanding among people, it supports culture and helps renew tourism (Richards, 1996). As Benjamin 
Porter and [[Noel B. Salazar]] have ethnographically documented, however, cultural heritage tourism can also create tensions and even conflict between the different stakeholders involved (Porter and Salazar 2005).&lt;ref name="Porter and Salazar"&gt;
{{cite journal
 |author=Porter, Benjamin W. and Noel B. Salazar
 |year=2005
 |title=Heritage tourism, conflict, and the public interest
 |journal=International Journal of Heritage Studies
 |volume=11
 |issue=5
 |doi=10.1080/13527250500337397
 |pages=361–370
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural heritage tourism has a number of objectives that must be met within the context of [[sustainable development]] such as; the conservation of cultural resources, accurate  interpretation of resources, authentic visitors experience, and the stimulation of the earned revenues of cultural resources. We can see, therefore, that cultural heritage tourism is not only concerned with identification, management and protection of the heritage values but it must also be involved in understanding the impact of tourism on communities and regions, achieving economic and social benefits, providing financial resources for protection, as well as marketing and promotion. ([[J. M. Fladmark]], 1994)

Heritage tourism involves visiting historical or industrial sites that may include old [[canal]]s, [[railway]]s, battlegrounds, etc. The overall purpose is to gain an appreciation of the past. It also refers to the marketing of a location to members of a [[diaspora]] who have distant family roots there.

==Immigration==
[[Decolonization]] and [[immigration]] form the major background of much contemporary heritage tourism. Falling travel costs have also made heritage tourism possible for more people.&lt;ref&gt;Winter, T. (2007). ''Post-Conflict Heritage, Postcolonial Tourism: Tourism, Politics and Development at Angkor''. Routledge. {{ISBN|041543095X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possible form involves religious travel or [[pilgrimage]]s. Many [[Catholics]] from around the world come to the [[Vatican City|Vatican]] and other sites such as [[Lourdes]] or [[Fátima, Portugal|Fátima]]. [[Islam]] commands its followers to take the ''[[hajj]]'' to [[Mecca]], thus differentiating it somewhat from tourism in the usual sense, though the trip can also be a culturally important event for the pilgrim.&lt;ref&gt;Basu, P. (2007). ''Highland homecomings: Genealogy and heritage tourism in the Scottish diaspora''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritage tourism can also be attributed to historical events that have been dramatised to make them more entertaining. For example, a historical tour of a town or city using a theme such as ghosts or Vikings. Heritage tourism focuses on certain historical events, rather than presenting a balanced view of that historical period. Its aim may not always be the presentation of accurate historical facts, as opposed to economically developing the site and surrounding area. As a result, heritage tourism can be seen as a blend of education, entertainment, preservation and profit.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy, D., &amp; Olsen, D. (Eds.). (2006). ''Tourism, religion and spiritual journeys''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenous peoples==
[[Anthropology]] and [[Ethnology]] were two major disciplines interested by the life of aborigines, their customs and political structures.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, M. (2001). The rise of anthropological theory: A history of theories of culture. AltaMira Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although, the firsts fieldworkers were not interested in expanding the colonization of main European powers, the fact was that their notes, books and field-work notes were employed by colonial officials to understand the aboriginal mind.&lt;ref&gt;Restrepo, E., &amp; Escobar, A. (2005). ‘Other Anthropologies and Anthropology Otherwise’Steps to a World Anthropologies Framework. ''[[Critique of Anthropology]]'', 25(2), 99-129.&lt;/ref&gt; From that moment on, anthropology developed a strange fascination for the [[Other (philosophy)|Other]]'s culture.&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, J., Dombrowski, K., Graburn, N., LeiteGoldberg, N., Phillips, R., Watkins, J., &amp; Clifford, J. (2004). Looking several ways: Anthropology and native heritage in Alaska. ''[[Current anthropology]]'', 45(1), 5-30.&lt;/ref&gt; The concepts of heritage and colonization were inextricably intertwined.&lt;ref&gt;Starzmann, M. T. (2008). Cultural imperialism and heritage politics in the event of armed conflict: prospects for an ‘activist archaeology’. ''Archaeologies'', 4(3), 368-389.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Community Tourism (Riven No 2).webm|thumb|Community tourism in Sierra Leone: The story of a community in Sierra Leone trying to manage tourism in a socially responsible manner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Tourism - Number2 River Association, Sierra Leone|url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL32A3F6F949A3F26D|work=The Vrinda Project|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=4 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Another problem with heritage tourism is the effect on indigenous peoples whose land and culture is being visited by tourists. If the indigenous people are not a part of the majority, or ruling power in the country, they may not benefit from the tourism as greatly as they should. For example, in Mexico tourism has increased because of the predicted [[end of the Maya Calendar]]. However, the indigenous [[Maya peoples|Maya]] are not benefitting from the increased traffic through the ruins and other cultural landmarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mayans Demand Inclusion in 'Doomsday Tourism' |url=http://indiancountrytodaymedianetwork.com/2012/01/21/mayans-demand-inclusion-doomsday-tourism-73721|work=[[Indian Country Today Media Network]]|accessdate=4 April 2014|date=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Promotion and facilitation ==
Heritage tourism is supported by municipalities through promotion and tourist information in many countries and their administrative units, e.g. cities as Polish [[Bydgoszcz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Visit Bydgoszcz|url=http://www.visitbydgoszcz.pl/en/|work= |publisher=Bydgoszcz Information Centre (Bydgoskie Centrum Informacji)|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Warsaw]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=WarsawTour|url=http://www.warsawtour.pl/en|work= |publisher=Warsaw Tourist Office|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are also many forms of presenting selected tourist topics in a harmonized way, for instance [[European Route of Brick Gothic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik|url=http://www.eurob.org/|work= |publisher=Europäische Route der Backsteingotik e.V.|accessdate=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many others ([[Cultural Route of the Council of Europe]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5658">[[Image:J-Dryden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[John Dryden]], who formulated and wrote the heroic drama in the 1670s.]]
'''Heroic drama''' is a type of [[Play (theatre)|play]] popular during the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] era in [[England]], distinguished by both its verse structure and its subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene M. Waith, ''Ideas of Greatness: Heroic Drama in England'', London, Routledge, 1971.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Douglas Canfield, ''Heroes and States: On the Ideology of Restoration Tragedy'', Lexington, KY, University Press of Kentucky, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The subgenre of heroic drama evolved through several works of the middle to later 1660s; [[John Dryden]]'s ''[[The Indian Emperour]]'' ([[1665 in literature|1665]]) and [[Roger Boyle, 1st Earl of Orrery| Roger Boyle's]] ''[[The Black Prince (play)|The Black Prince]]'' ([[1667 in literature|1667]]) were key developments.

==Dryden in 1670==
The term "heroic drama" was invented by Dryden for his play, ''[[The Conquest of Granada]]'' ([[1670 in literature|1670]]).  For the ''Preface'' to the printed version of the play, Dryden argued that the drama was a species of ''[[epic poetry]]'' for the stage, that, as the epic was to other poetry, so the heroic drama was to other plays.  Consequently, Dryden derived a series of rules for this type of play.

First, the play should be composed in [[heroic verse]] (closed couplets in iambic pentameter).  Second, the play must focus on a subject that pertains to national foundations, mythological events, or important and grand matters.  Third, the hero of the heroic drama must be powerful, decisive, and, like [[Achilles]], dominating even when wrong.  ''The Conquest of Granada'' followed all of these rules.  The story was that of the national foundation of [[Spain]] (and [[Charles II of England|King Charles II]] was known to be fond of Spanish plays), and the hero, Almanzor, was a man of great martial prowess and temperament.

Dryden's ''Conquest of Granada'' is often considered one of the better heroic tragedies, but his highest achievement is his adaptation (which he called ''All for Love'', 1678) of Shakespeare's ''Anthony and Cleopatra'' to the heroic formula. Other heroic dramatists were Nathaniel Lee (''The Rival Queens'') and Thomas Otway, whose ''Venice Preserved'' is a fine tragedy that transcends the usual limitations of the form. We also owe indirectly to heroic tragedy two very amusing parodies of the type: the Duke of Buckingham's ''The Rehearsal'' and Henry Fielding's ''The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the Life and Death of Tom Thumb the Great''

==Other dramatists==
"Those who associate 'heroic drama' primarily with the use of the 'heroic couplet' usually set as its extent the years from 1664 to 1678. This, certainly, is its period of fullest development and authority. Those who prefer to accentuate the elements suggested by the very term 'heroic' rather than the strict rhymed verse form are willing to admit wider limits."&lt;ref&gt;George Henry Nettleton, ''English Drama of the Restoration and Eighteenth Century, 1642&amp;ndash;1780'', New York, Macmillan, 1914; p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Restoration plays by Sir [[William Davenant]], [[Thomas Otway]], [[Nathaniel Lee]], [[John Crowne]], [[Elkanah Settle]], and [[John Banks (playwright)|John Banks]], and later works by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and [[Joseph Addison]], have been included in tighter or looser definitions of heroic drama.&lt;ref&gt;Nettleton, pp. 24-9; Waith, pp. 235-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heroic drama in literary criticism==
Today, drama is divided up into numerous subgenres; Dryden, however, worked from [[Classical literature|Classical]] critics.  There was little dramatic critical theory for him to appeal to, and the new rules brought over from [[France]] (particularly those of [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]] and [[Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux|Boileau]]) did not match English theatrical history or practice.  The emphasis on unities and on maintaining only Classically proscribed dramatic forms also came from [[Thomas Rymer]], who condemned the heterogeneity of the stage.  [[Aristotle]] had only spoken of [[satire]], [[Epic poetry|epic]], and [[tragedy]], and [[Horace]] also wrote only of [[comedy]], tragedy and satire, and so Dryden was seeking to square actual theatrical practice with an ancient framework for literature.  He was attempting his own neo-classicism.  The [[First Folio]] of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] had divided Shakespeare's plays into "history," "tragedy," and "comedy," but these terms were stretched.  Dryden, therefore, implicitly recognizes that drama had moved into the territory of other types of poetry, but he strives to restrain that freedom by reforming the stage to a true and epic subject matter. 

==Satirical response==
[[George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]] and others satirized heroic drama in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]''.  The satire was successful enough that heroic drama largely disappeared afterward.  Buckingham attacked the stupidity of blustering, military heroes, as well as the apparent self-importance of attempting a dramatic entertainment about the serious subjects of military and national history.

Buckingham's criticism of Dryden in ''[[The Rehearsal (play)|The Rehearsal]]'' is partly Dryden's bombastic verse but, more pointedly, Dryden's ''personal'' interest in creating a "pure" drama.  The character of Bayes is ludicrous more for his hubris in damning actual plays in favor of imagined ones than he is for being a poetaster.

'''Social work''' has its roots in the attempts of [[society]] at large to deal with the problem of poverty and inequality. Social work is intricately linked with the idea of [[Charity (virtue)|charity]] work; but must be understood in broader terms. The concept of charity goes back to ancient times, and the practice of providing for the poor has roots in all [[Major religious groups|major world religions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalenvision.org/forteachers/28/1258/ |title=Religion |accessdate=2008-04-09 |work=Middle School Lesson Plans |publisher=Global Envision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern antecedents==
Even before the rise of modern European states, the church was providing social services. When [[Constantine I]] legalized the [[Christian Church]] in the 4th century, the newly legitimised church set up burial societies, [[poorhouse]]s, homes for the aged, shelter for the homeless, hospitals, and [[orphanage]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander Clarence Flick|year=1919|title=The Rise of the Mediaeval Church and Its Influence on the Civilisation of Western Europe from the First to the Thirteenth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ApLaUMO0ZycC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ishm2006.hu/scientific/abstract.php?ID=138G. Kalantzis (2006). The Historical Evolution of Social Medicine in Byzantium (330-1453 AD)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract;jsessionid=4A665169DCB94F67A7CF47ECC60F22C0.tomcat1?fromPage=online&amp;aid=1316632 C. Gilleard (2007) Ageing &amp; Society — Old age in Byzantine society] (2007), 27: 623-642, Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; These were often funded, at least in part, from grants from the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Burckhardt, Jacob |title = The Age of Constantine the Great| publisher = Random House (Vintage) | year = 1967 | isbn = 0-520-04680-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 580 AD the church had a system for circulating consumables to the poor: associated with each [[parish]] was a ''diaconium'' or office of the [[deacon]].&lt;!---probably well before 590 like maybe in the 1st century.---&gt; Monasteries also often served as comprehensive social service agencies, acting as hospitals, homes for the aged, orphanages,  travelers' aid stations.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the Christian church had vast influence on European society and charity was considered to be a responsibility and a sign of one’s piety. This charity was in the form of direct relief (for example, giving money, food, or other material goods to alleviate a particular need), as opposed to trying to change the root causes of poverty. As there was no effective bureaucracy below city government that was capable of large scale charitable activities, the clergy carried out this role until the [[Early Modern Period]].

==Modern development==
It was not until the emergence of [[industrialization]] and [[urbanization]] that the informal helping systems of the church and family began to be replaced by social welfare services.

The practice and profession of social work has a relatively modern and scientific origin,&lt;ref name="BoiseStateI"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I. Scientific Philanthropy (1860-1900) |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-1.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is generally considered to have developed out of three strands. The first was individual casework, a strategy pioneered by the [[Charity Organisation Society]] in the mid-19th century. The
second was social administration, which included various forms of poverty relief. Statewide poverty relief could be said to have its roots in the English [[Poor Laws]] of the 17th century, but was first systematized through the efforts of the Charity Organisation Society. The third consisted of social action - rather than engaging in the resolution of immediate individual requirements, the emphasis was placed on political action working through the community and the group to improve their social conditions and thereby alleviate poverty. This approach was developed originally by the [[settlement house]] movement.&lt;ref name="Lymbery"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uk.sagepub.com/upm-data/9812_039472ch02.pdf|author=Lymbery|title=The History and Development of Social Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was accompanied by a less easily defined movement; the development of institutions to deal with the entire range of social problems. All had their most rapid growth during the nineteenth century, and laid the foundational basis for modern social work, both in theory and in practice.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"&gt;Popple, Philip R. and Leighninger, Leslie. Social Work, Social Welfare, American Society.Boston:Allyn&amp;Bacon,2011.Print&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional social work originated in 19th century England, and had its roots in the social and economic upheaval wrought by the [[Industrial Revolution]], in particular the societal struggle to deal with the resultant mass urban-based [[poverty]] and its related problems. Because poverty was the main focus of early social work, it was intricately linked with the idea of charity work.&lt;ref name="Popple, Philip R 2011"/&gt; (Today, it is common for social workers to find themselves dealing with consequences arising from other social problems such as racism, sexism, homophobia, and discrimination based on age or on physical or mental disability.)

===Poverty relief===
[[File:Doutielt3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The Poor Laws in the aftermath of the [[Black Death]] (pictured), when labour was in short supply, were concerned with making the able bodied work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uakron.edu/dotAsset/726694.pdf |title=Five Hundred Years of English Poor Laws, 1349–1834:Regulating the Working and Nonworking Poor |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-07-22}}Akron Law Review 30 (1996): 73–128&lt;/ref&gt;(also see: [[Sturdy beggar]])]]
With the decline of [[feudalism]] in 16th century England, the indigent poor came to be seen as a more direct threat to the social order.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.socialworkdegreeguide.com/faq/what-is-the-history-of-the-social-work-profession&lt;/ref&gt; As they were often not associated to a particular feudal manor, the government moved towards the formation of an organized poverty relief system to care for them.

The origins of the [[English Poor Law]] system can be traced as far back as late medieval statutes dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the Poor Law system became codified. [[Monasteries]], the primary source of poor relief, were dissolved by the Tudors [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] causing poor relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level.&lt;ref name="victorianweb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html |title=The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early legislation was concerned with [[vagrants]] and making the [[able-bodied]] work, especially while labour was in short supply following the [[Black Death]].

The first complete code of poor relief was made in the [[Act for the Relief of the Poor 1597]] and some provision for the "deserving poor" was eventually made in the [[Elizabethan Poor Law (1601)|Elizabethan Poor Law]] of 1601.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Higginbotham |url=http://workhouses.org/ |title=www.workhouses.org.uk |publisher=www.workhouses.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It created a system administered at parish level,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyhome.co.uk/peel/poorlaw/plaa.htm |title=The Old Poor Law 1795–1834 |publisher=Historyhome.co.uk |date=2009-01-19 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; paid for by levying local rates on rate payers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdlp.co.uk/resources/general/poor_law.htm |title=A Short Explanation of the English Poor Law |publisher=Mdlp.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relief for those too ill or old to work, the so-called '[[impotent poor]]', was in the form of a payment or items of food ('the parish loaf') or clothing also known as [[outdoor relief]]. Some aged people might be accommodated in parish [[alms house]]s, though these were usually private charitable institutions. Meanwhile, able-bodied beggars who had refused work were often placed in [[House of Correction|Houses of Correction]] or even subjected to beatings to mend their attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/elizpl.html |title=The 1601 Elizabethan Poor Law |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As populations grew in [[Colonial America]], [[almhouses]] were built to house vulnerable people with no other support, including people with a long term illness or older people without families.  The first recorded Almshouse was built in 1713 near [[Philadelphia]] by William Penn, and was only open to [[Quakers]]. A second one was built nearby in 1728, this time with public money. In 1736 New York opened the Poor House of the City of New York (later renamed [[Bellevue Hospital]]) and in 1737 [[New Orleans]] opened the Saint John's Hospital to serve the poor of the city.&lt;ref name=gehlert&gt;Gehlert, S. in Gehlert, S. and T.A. Browne (2006). Chapter Two: The Conceptual Underpinnings of social work in health care. ''Handbook of Health Social Work''. New Jersey:WILEY&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Poor Law Amendment Act 1834|Poor Law Amendment Act]] completely overhauled the existing system in Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/changes.html |title=Changing attitudes towards poverty after 1815 |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and established a [[Poor Law Commission]] to oversee the national operation of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/plcommiss.html |title=The Poor Law Commission |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-11-12 |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This included the forming together of small parishes into [[Poor Law Unions]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/types/status_page.jsp?unit_status=PLU |title=Administrative Units Typology &amp;#124; Status definition: Poor Law Union |publisher=Visionofbritain.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the building of workhouses in each union for the giving of poor relief. Although the aim of the legislation was to reduce costs to rate payers, one area not reformed was the method of financing of the Poor Law system which continued to be paid for by levying a "poor rate"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/poorlaw/savings.html |title=Savings on the poor rates made by the 1834 Poor Law Amendment Act |publisher=Victorianweb.org |date=2002-09-17 |accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the property owning middle classes.

Although the [[Poor Law Amendment Act]] did not ban all forms of [[outdoor relief]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.learningcurve.gov.uk/victorianbritain/caring/default.htm |title=The National Archives Learning Curve &amp;#124; Victorian Britain &amp;#124; Caring Nation |publisher=Learningcurve.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-05-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080828041756/http://learningcurve.gov.uk/victorianbritain/caring/default.htm |archivedate=2008-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; it stated that no able-bodied person was to receive money or other help from the Poor Law authorities except in a [[workhouse]]. Conditions in workhouses were to be made harsh to discourage people from claiming. Workhouses were to be built in every parish and, if parishes were too small, parishes could group together to form [[Workhouse Unions]]. The [[Poor Law Commissioners]] were to be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the Act.

===Private philanthropy===
[[File:Charity to Street Arab.jpg|150px|thumb|Social work involves ameliorating social problems such as poverty and homelessness.]]
The 19th century saw a great leap forward in technological and scientific achievement. There was also a great [[Urbanization|migration]] to urban areas throughout the [[Western world]], which led to many social problems. This galvanised the socially active, prosperous middle and upper classes to search for ways to ameliorate the physical and spiritual conditions of the poor underclasses.&lt;ref name="EDINBURGH"&gt;{{cite web|title=Social Work History |publisher=[[University of Edinburgh]] |url=http://www.socialwork.ed.ac.uk/social/history.html |accessdate=2008-02-20 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071221085300/http://www.socialwork.ed.ac.uk/social/history.html |archivedate=2007-12-21 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was coupled with a religious revival, and many Protestant mission efforts (urban missions), attempted to resolve the problems inherent in large cities like poverty, prostitution, disease, and other afflictions. A new philosophy of "scientific charity" emerged, which stated charity should be "secular, rational and empirical as opposed to sectarian, sentimental, and dogmatic.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateII"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter I.2 Missionaries &amp; Volunteers |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/1-2.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

During this time, rescue societies were initiated to find more appropriate means of self-support for women involved in prostitution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} State-built [[Mental asylum]]s were built from the 1840s to assist in taking care of the [[mentally ill]].

Most historians identify the [[Charity Organization Society]], founded by [[Helen Bosanquet]] and [[Octavia Hill]] in London in 1869,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |title=1800s |work=Family Action: About Us |accessdate=17 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718211919/http://www.family-action.org.uk/section.aspx?id=1155 |archivedate=18 July 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as the pioneering organization of the social theory that led to the emergence of social work as a professional occupation.&lt;ref name="Lymbery" /&gt; COS had its main focus on individual casework. It supported the concept of self-help and limited government intervention to deal with the effects of poverty. The organisation claimed to use "scientific principles to root out scroungers and target relief where it was most needed".&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Rosemary (2001). ''Poverty and Public Health 1815-1949''. London: Heinemann.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Octavia-Hill-by-Sargent.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|alt=portrait of a Victorian woman of middle age facing the artist, head slightly to the right|[[Octavia Hill]] pioneered many aspects of social work. Portrait by [[John Singer Sargent]], 1898]]
[[Alsager Hay Hill]] was prominent from its foundation, acting as honorary secretary of the council until July 1870, and as an active member of the council until 1880.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite wikisource|title=Hill, Alsager Hay (DNB12)|last=|first=|year=|publisher=|page=|wspage=|scan=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill also worked as an almoner to the Society for the Relief of Distress in the East of London. He campaigned about the many flaws in the [[poor laws]] and urged for a more scientific classification of paupers. His 1867 pamphlet, on ''Our Unemployed,'' was one of the earliest attempts to highlight the problem of systemic [[unemployment]];  he suggested a national system of labour registration. In 1871, Hill pioneered a system of [[labour exchange]]s in England, establishing 'The Employment Inquiry Office and Labour Registry,'. There, Hill advised applicants for assistance, and founded and edited ''Labour News'' to improve communication between masters and men seeking work.&lt;ref name=CNHistory&gt;{{cite news|title=History in the making|url=http://www.cnplus.co.uk/news/history-in-the-making/949883.article|accessdate=20 February 2015|work=Construction News|date=5 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Octavia Hill]] is regarded by many as the founder of modern social work. She was a moving force behind the development of social housing, and her early friendship with [[John Ruskin]] enabled her to put her theories into practice with the aid of his initial investment. She believed in self-reliance, and made it a key part of her housing system that she and her assistants knew their tenants personally and encouraged them to better themselves. She was opposed to municipal provision of housing, believing it to be bureaucratic and impersonal. Under her guidance, the Charity Organisation Society organised charitable grants and pioneered a home-visiting service that formed the basis for modern social work.

[[File:London-slum-1880s.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Victorian photograph of the exterior of a London slum property|A [[Marylebone]] slum in the nineteenth century.]]
She also provided housing for the poor; after being improved her properties were let to those on intermittent and low incomes. At the heart of the Octavia Hill system was the weekly visit to collect rent. From the outset, Hill conceived this as a job for women only. She and her assistants, including [[Emma Cons]] combined the weekly rent collection with checking every detail of the premises and getting to know the tenants personally, acting as early social workers.&lt;ref name="dnb"&gt;Darley, Gillian, [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/printable/33873 "Hill, Octavia (1838–1912)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 1 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; At first Hill believed, "Voluntary workers are a necessity. They are better than paid workers, and can be had in sufficient numbers."&lt;ref name=mann&gt;Mann, Peter H., "Octavia Hill: An Appraisal", ''The Town Planning Review'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (October 1952), pp. 223–37&lt;/ref&gt; Later, she found it expedient to maintain a paid workforce.&lt;ref name="dnb"/&gt;

Hill's principles were summed up in an article of 1869: "Where a man persistently refuses to exert himself, external help is worse than useless." She was an outspoken critic of the principles of "[[outdoor relief]]" or the [[Speenhamland system]] of poor relief as operated by various Poor Law Boards. Because these systems did not encourage recipients to work, she regarded them as "a profligate use of public funds."&lt;ref name=wyatt2&gt;Wyatt, R.J. (2000). ''Octavia Hill and The Crown Estate – a Continuing Legacy?'', [[The Crown Estate]] p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Under her methods, personal responsibility was encouraged. She insisted on dealing with arrears promptly; she appointed reliable caretakers; she took up of references on prospective tenants, and visited them in their homes; she paid careful attention to allocations and the placing of tenants, with regard to size of families and the size and location of the accommodation to be offered; and she made no rules that could not be properly enforced.&lt;ref name=wyatt2/&gt;

===Social action===
[[File:Toynbee Hall 1902.jpg|thumb|[[Toynbee Hall]] settlement house, [[Whitechapel]] was founded in 1884 as part of the [[Settlement movement]]. Pictured here in 1902.]]
A stress on social action that developed in the 1880s, was pioneered by the [[Settlement house]] movement.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateIII"&gt;{{cite web|last = Huff |first = Dan |title = Chapter II. Settlements (1880-1900) |work =[http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/central/core.htm The Social Work History Station] |publisher = [[Boise State University]] |url =http://www.boisestate.edu/socwork/dhuff/history/chapts/2-1.htm|accessdate = 2008-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Movement (creating integrated mixed communities of rich and poor) grew directly out of Octavia Hill's work. Her colleagues [[Samuel Augustus Barnett|Samuel]] and [[Henrietta Barnett]], founded [[Toynbee Hall]], [[Oxford House (settlement)|Oxford House]]&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357" /&gt; in 1884 in Bethnal Green as the first university-sponsored settlement. Another early organization was Mansfield House Settlement, also in east London.

The settlement was named after [[Arnold Toynbee]], an economic historian who's intellectual work laid the foundations of the movement. Toynbee was actively involved in improving the living conditions of the [[labourer]]. He read for workers in large industrial centres and encouraged the creation of trade unions and [[co-operative]]s. A focal point of his commitment was the slum of [[Whitechapel]], in east London, where he helped to establish public libraries for the working class population. Toynbee also encouraged his students to offer free courses for working class audiences in their own neighbourhoods.

In America, the settlement movement was established by [[Jane Addams]], a young medical student, and [[Ellen Gates Starr]] after Addams visited Toynbee Hall and was impressed by the system. She founded [[Chicago]]'s [[Hull House]] in 1889, which focused on providing education and recreational facilities for European immigrant women and children.&lt;ref name="Danilov pp. 356-357"&gt;{{cite book|author=Victor J. Danilov|title=Famous Americans: A Directory of Museums, Historic Sites, and Memorials|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kWsrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356|date=26 September 2013|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-9186-9|pages=356–357|chapter=Social Activists}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states.&lt;ref&gt;Husock, H. (1993). "Bringing back the settlement house". ''Public Welfare'', 51(4).&lt;/ref&gt; The house was both a community service centre and a social research program.  Precursors to modern social work arose at Hull House as health professionals began to work with social determinants of poor health.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt; 

[[File:Bohemmian Youth East St. Louis.jpg|thumb|left|Bohemian immigrant youth at the [[Lessie Bates Davis Neighborhood House]] in 1918 in East St. Louis, Illinois.]]
The concept of the Settlement house movement was to bring upper and middle class students into lower-class neighbourhoods, not only to provide education and social aid, but to actually live and work together with their inhabitants. This soon inspired a worldwide movement of university settlements. The idea was to help members of the future elite understand the problems of wider society; this was especially important at a time when class divisions were much stronger, [[social mobility]] was minimal, and the living conditions of the poor were completely unknown to many members of the upper class.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Marshall, "[http://www.disei.unifi.it/upload/sub/pubblicazioni/msb/e_r/toynbee6.pdf On Arnold Toynbee]", ed. John K. Whitaker, ''Marshall Studies Bulletin'' 6 (1996): 45–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The settlement movement focused on the causes of poverty through the "three Rs" - Research, Reform, and Residence. They provided a variety of services including educational, legal, and health services. These programs also advocated changes in social policy. Workers in the settlement movement immersed themselves in the culture of those they were helping. There were basic commonalities in the movement. These institutions were more concerned with societal causes for poverty, especially the changes that came with industrialization, rather than personal causes which their predecessors believed were the main reason for poverty. The settlement movement believed that social reform was best pursued and pushed for by private charities.&lt;ref name="BoiseStateIII"/&gt;

The movement gave rise to many social policy initiatives and innovative ways of working to improve the conditions of the most excluded members of society. Participating universities settled students in [[slum]]s to live and work alongside the poor local people. Settlement houses focused on education, savings, sports, and arts. The Poor Man's Lawyer service came about because a barrister volunteered his time and encouraged his friends to do the same. In general, the settlement movement, and settlement houses in particular, were "...a foundation for social work practice in this country".&lt;ref&gt;Reyes, J. M. (2008). Common space, safe place: Lived experiences of former settlement house participants from the West Town and Humboldt Park neighborhoods of Chicago''  Dissertation Abstract International'', ''69''(5), 1682A. (UMI No. AAI3314871) Retrieved July 13, 2009, from Dissertations and Theses Database.&lt;/ref&gt;

One important participant in the scheme was the philanthropist [[Charles Booth (philanthropist)|Charles Booth]] who published his study ''Life and Labour of the People in London'' in 1889 while working at Toynbee Hall. The study was the first systematic attempt at gathering comprehensive statistics and mapping poverty and influenced both social research and the fight against poverty for decades afterwards.

By the beginning of the 20th century, these different organizations with their diverse intellectual underpinnings were beginning to coalesce into modern social work. Foundations were established to examine the root causes of social problems such as poverty, and social workers became more professional and scientific in their methodology. The Quaker philanthropist and chocolate manufacturer [[Joseph Rowntree (philanthropist)|Joseph Rowntree]] believed that social evils could be tackled by systematic research, and to that end founded the [[Joseph Rowntree Foundation]] in 1904.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp History of JRF on official website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090123052812/http://jrf.org.uk/about-us/history.asp |date=2009-01-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rowntree wanted to tackle the root causes of social problems, rather than treating their symptoms. His Memorandum of 1904 stated: "I feel that much of the current philanthropic effort is directed to remedying the more superficial manifestations of weakness or evil, while little thought or effort is directed to search out their underlying causes ... [seek] to search out the under-lying causes of weakness or evil in the community, rather than ... remedying their more superficial manifestations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/about-us/our-heritage JRF's Our heritage page]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowntree's son, [[Seebohm Rowntree]], carried out a series of seminal surveys into poverty in the city of [[York]] that greatly influenced public and governmental attitudes towards poverty and deprivation. His first York study of 1899 (this was followed up in 1935 and 1951) was a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Asa, ''Social Thought and Social Action'', page 25.&lt;/ref&gt; The results of this study were published in 1901 in his book [[Poverty, A Study of Town Life]] and claimed that 27.84 percent of the total population of York lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref&gt;Rowntree, B S: "Poverty: A Study in Town Life", page 298. Macmillian and CO., 1901&lt;/ref&gt;

Rowntree defined the poverty line in terms of a minimum weekly sum of money "necessary to enable families... to secure the necessaries of a healthy life", including fuel and light, rent, food, clothing, and household and personal items. This was quantified using scientific methods that hadn't been applied to the study of poverty before. For example, he consulted leading [[nutritionist]]s of the period to discover the minimum [[calorific]] intake and nutritional balance necessary before people got ill or lost weight. He then surveyed the prices of food in York to discover what the cheapest prices in the area for the food needed for this minimum [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] were and used this information to set his poverty line.

In analysing the results of the investigation he found that people at certain stages of life, for example in old age and early childhood, were more likely to be in abject poverty, living below the poverty line, than at other stages of life. From this he formulated the idea of the poverty cycle&lt;ref&gt;Searle, G R: "A New England?", page 196. Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; in which some people moved in and out of absolute poverty during their lives. Rowntree's argument that poverty was the result of low wages went against the traditionally held view that the poor were responsible for their own plight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html Joseph Rowntree Foundation Centenary: Poverty&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012011147/http://www.jrf.org.uk/centenary/poverty.html |date=2008-10-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differing approaches to social work often led to heated debates. In the early 20th century, [[Mary Richmond]] of the [[Charity Organization Society]] (COS) and [[Jane Addams]] of the [[Settlement movement|Settlement House Movement]] engaged in a public dispute over the optimal approach; whether the problem should be tackled with COS' traditional, [[scientific method]] that focused on efficiency and prevention, or whether the Settlement House Movement's immersion into the problem, blurring the lines of practitioner and client, was superior.&lt;ref name="Social Work"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Parker-Oliver | first = Debra|author2=Demiris, George | title = Social Work Informatics: A New Specialty | journal = Social Work | volume = 51 | issue = 2 | pages = 127–134 | publisher = [[National Association of Social Workers]] | date = April 2006 | url =http://lysander.naswpressonline.org/vl=7534711/cl=13/nw=1/rpsv/cw/nasw/00378046/v51n2/s4/p127| accessdate =2008-02-19| pmid = 16858918 | doi=10.1093/sw/51.2.127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even as schools of social work opened and formalized processes for social work began to be developed, the question "is social work a profession?" lingered. In 1915, at the American National Conference of Charities and Corrections, Dr. [[Abraham Flexner]] spoke on the topic "Is Social Work a Profession?" He contended that it was not because it lacked specialized knowledge and specific application of theoretical and intellectual knowledge to solve human and social problems.&lt;ref name="UM-SSW"&gt;{{cite web|title = From Charitable Volunteers to Architects of Social Welfare: A Brief History of Social Work |publisher = [[University of Michigan]] |url =http://www.ssw.umich.edu/ongoing/fall2001/briefhistory.html |accessdate = 2007-02-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the professionalization of social work, concentrating on case work and the scientific method..

==Medical Social Work==
[[File:Jane Addams profile.jpg|150px|thumbnail|100px|[[Jane Addams]] (1860–1935) was a founder of the [[Settlement movement|U.S. Settlement House movement]] and is considered one of the early influences on professional social work in the United States.]]
The first professional [[medical social work]]ers in England were called hospital almoners, and were based in medical institutions. The [[Royal Free Hospital]], London hired [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] as the first almoner in 1895. Her role was to assess people requesting treatment at the hospital to ensure that they were considered "deserving enough" of the free treatment. The role soon developed to cover the provision of other social programs, and by 1905 other hospitals had created similar roles.  By this time, the Hospital Almoners Council had been formed to oversee the new profession.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt;

The first professional medical social workers to be hired in the United States were Garnet Pelton (6 months) and Ida Cannon (40 years), in 1905 at the [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] was a key advocate in the creation of the role, as he believed there to be a link between tuberculosis and sanitary conditions. Both Pelton and Cannon had trained as nurses before taking up the role. After graduating from Simmons College in 1907, Cabot was in charge of the outpatient ward of the hospital, and together with the newly created social workers, they redefined the way in which health and wellbeing was managed. The economic, social, family and psychological conditions that underpinned many of the conditions that patients presented with were recognised for the first time. Social workers would work in a complementary relationship with doctors, the former concentrating on physiological health, and the latter on social health. In addition to this, he saw that social work could improve medicine by providing a critical perspective on it while working alongside it in an organisational setting.

This approach soon spread through other American hospitals, and in 1911, there were 44 social work departments in 14 different cities. Two years later, the number of social work departments had grown to 200. After 1905, most social workers were trained as nurses. The American Association of Hospital Social Workers was set up in 1918 to increase the links between formal education and hospital practice.  In 1929 there were ten university courses in medical social work.  Around this time, [[psychiatry]] and [[psychology]] began to compete with social work as the complementary discourse to medicine in hospitals. Social work practice adapted to this by aligning itself more closely with [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic ideas]], and became less concerned with living conditions and social health. While this detracted from the social concerns, it added a more scientific basis to dealing with patients, and challenging behaviours were more likely to be seen as a mental dysfunction than poor moral character.&lt;ref name=gehlert/&gt;  The increase of social spending after World War Two saw another rise in the number of social workers.

==State Welfare==
[[Image:William Beveridge D 17134.jpg|thumb|200px|[[William Beveridge]]'s ''[[Beveridge Report]]'' of 1942 laid the foundations for the welfare state.]]
As the problem of poverty moved up the public agenda, it became increasingly clear that [[laissez-faire]] economic policies were not working and that governments had to take proactive measures to reduce poverty, rather than leave the task to privately run organizations. The principles of [[classical liberalism]] were being increasingly challenged by downturns in economic growth, a growing perception of the evils of poverty, unemployment and relative deprivation present within modern industrial cities, and the agitation of [[organized labour]]. New liberals began to adapt the old language of liberalism to confront these difficult circumstances, which they believed could only be resolved through a broader and more interventionist conception of the state.&lt;ref name='eatwell'&gt;{{Cite book|last=Eatwell|first=Roger|author2=Wright, Anthony|title=Contemporary political ideologies|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1999|isbn=9780826451736}}&lt;/ref&gt; A liberal convert to greater government intervention was [[Thomas Hill Green]], who believed that the state should foster and protect the social, political and economic environments in which individuals will have the best chance of acting according to their consciences. The state should intervene only where there is a clear, proven and strong tendency of a liberty to enslave the individual.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholson, P. P., “T. H. Green and State Action: Liquor Legislation’, History of Political Thought, 6 (1985), 517–50. Reprinted in A. Vincent, ed., The Philosophy of T. H. Green (Aldershot: Gower, 1986), pp. 76–103&lt;/ref&gt;

This strand began to coalesce into the [[social liberalism]] movement at the turn of the twentieth century in Britain.&lt;ref name="adams"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Adams|first=Ian|title=Political Ideology Today (Politics Today)|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=0719060206|year=2001|location=Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their view, the poverty, squalor, and ignorance in which many people lived made it impossible for freedom and individuality to flourish. In the early 1900s, the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] under [[Herbert Henry Asquith|H.H. Asquith]] introduced various [[Liberal reforms|reforms]], including [[health insurance]], [[unemployment insurance]], and [[pension]]s for elderly workers, thereby laying the groundwork for the future British [[welfare state]].&lt;ref&gt;Heywood, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Beveridge]], often called the 'architect of the welfare state', was pivotal in framing the debate about social work in the context of state welfare provision. His 1942 report on ''Social Insurance and Allied Services'',&lt;ref name="Original report title page"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Beveridge|first1=William|title=Social Insurance and Allied Services|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|website=British Library|publisher=BL|accessdate=8 July 2014|ref=Original report title page|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714233116/http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/takingliberties/staritems/712beveridgereportpic.html|archivedate=14 July 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; known commonly as the ''[[Beveridge Report]]'', identified five "Giant Evils" in society: squalor, ignorance, want, idleness, and disease, and went on to propose widespread reform to the system of social welfare to mitigate these problems.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Abel‐Smith, "The Beveridge report: Its origins and outcomes." ''International Social Security Review'' (1992) 45#1‐2 pp 5-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The report proved very popular with a war-weary public, and went on to form the basis to the post-war expansion of the Welfare State and the creation of the [[National Health Service]], a free at the point of delivery healthcare provider.

==Today==
Currently, social work is known for its critical and holistic approach to understanding and intervening in social problems. This has led, for example, to the recognition of poverty as having a social and economic basis rooted in social policies rather than representing a personal moral defect. This trend also points to another historical development in the evolution of social work: once a profession engages  in social control, it is directed at social and personal empowerment.

This is not to say that modern social workers do not engage in social control (consider, for example, child protection workers), and many, if not most, social workers likely would agree that there is an ongoing tension between these forces within the profession. For example, see the debate between structural social work and [[Humanistic psychology|humanistic social work]].&lt;ref name="Payne"&gt;Payne, M. (2011). ''Humanistic Social Work: Core Principles in Practice. Chicago: Lyceum, Basingstoke, Palgrave Macmillan''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28531">'''Jewish commentaries on the Bible''' are [[List of biblical commentaries|biblical commentaries]] of the [[Hebrew Bible]] (the [[Tanakh]]) from a Jewish perspective. Translations into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] and English, and some universally accepted Jewish commentaries with notes on their method of approach and modern translations into English with notes are listed.

== Earliest printing ==
The complete Tanakh in Hebrew, with commentaries by [[Rashi]], [[Radak]], [[Nahmanides|Ramban]], and [[Ralbag]] was printed in 1517 by [[Daniel Bomberg]] and edited by [[Felix Pratensis]] under the name [[Mikraot Gedolot]].

The Tanakh was handed down in manuscript form along with a method of checking the accuracy of the transcription known as [[Masoretic Text|mesorah]]. Many codices containing the [[Masoretic Text]] were gathered by [[Jacob ben Hayyim ibn Adonijah]] and were used to publish an accurate text. It was published by [[Daniel Bomberg]] in 1525. Later editions were edited with the help of [[Elia Levita]]. Various editions of Mikraot Gedolot are still in print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/~elsegal/TalmudMap/MG.html |title=Mikra'ot Gedolot |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Translations ==

=== Targum ===
A [[Targum]] is a translation of the Bible into [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]. The classic Targumim are [[Targum Onkelos]] on the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] (a [[Torah]] in printed form), [[Targum Jonathan]] on [[Nevi'im]] (the Prophets), and a fragmentary [[Targum Yerushalmi]]. There is no standard Aramaic translation of the [[Ketuvim]].&lt;ref&gt;Megilla 3a&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Targim Onkelos ====
[[Targum Onkelos]] is the most often consulted literal translation of the Bible&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica:Bible:Targum Onkelos:third paragrph&lt;/ref&gt; with a few exceptions. Figurative language is usually not translated literally but is explained (e.g., Gen. 49:25; Ex. 15:3, 8, 10; 29:35). Geographical names are often replaced by those current at a later time (e.g., Gen. 10:10; Deut. 3:17).

According to the [[Talmud]],&lt;ref&gt;Bavli, Megilla, 3a as understood by the Marshah, Chidushai Agadot on Nedorim, 9b. See also the Yam Shel Shlomo on Yebomot chapter 12&lt;/ref&gt; the Torah and its translation into Aramaic were given to Moses on Mount Sinai, because Egyptian slaves spoke Aramaic. After the [[Babylonian exile]], the Targum was completely forgotten. [[Onkelos]], a Roman convert to Judaism, was able to reconstruct the original Aramaic. [[Saadia Gaon]] disagrees and says the Aramaic of Onkelos was never a spoken language. He believed that Onkelos's Aramaic was an artificial construct, a combination of Eastern and Western dialects of Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia Judaica: Bible&lt;/ref&gt; The mayor commentary on Targum Onkelos is "Netinah LaGer" written by [[Nathan Marcus Adler]].

==== Targum Jonathan ====
According to scholars, Targum Jonathan found in the [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] was not written by [[Jonathan ben Uzziel]], who refer to it instead as [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]]. According to the ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'', 2nd ed., vol. 3, p. 591&lt;/ref&gt; internal evidence shows that it was written sometime between the 7th and 14th centuries CE. For example, [[Ishmael]]'s wife's name is translated into Aramaic as [[Fatima (name)|Fatima]] (who was Mohammed's daughter) and therefore Targum Pseudo-Jonathan must have been written after [[Mohammed]]'s birth. The classic Hebrew commentators would turn this argument around, and say that Mohammed's daughter was named after Ismael's wife. Both sides will agree, however that stylistically Jonathan's commentary on the Chumash is very different from the commentary on [[Neviim]]. The Targum Jonathan on Neviim is written in a very terse style, similar to Onkelos on Chumash, but on the average Targum Jonathan on Chumash is almost twice as wordy.

==== Targum Yerushalmi ====
The Jerusalem Targum exists only in fragmentary form. It translates a total of approximately 850 verses, phrases, and words. No one knows who wrote it. Some speculate that it was a printers error. The printer saw a manuscript headed with "TY" and assumed it was a Targum Yerushalmi when actually it was an early version of Targum Yonathan. Others speculate that it was written by a R. Yosef or R. Hoshea (Yihoshua).&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein's ''Otzer Yisrael'', v. 10 p. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

He clearly separates the literal meaning of a biblical verse from the traditional meaning, upon which the halacha is based, and from the homiletic meaning ''drush''. He explains that the traditional meaning and the homiletic meaning do not attempt to imply meaning to the verse; they only uses the verse as a mnemonic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Online Jewish Encyclopedia| title=Ibn Ezra, Abraham| date=1901–1906}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[David Kimhi]] 1160–1235
:: David Kimchi followed the methodology of Ibn Ezra. He deemphasised homiletics and emphasised the Talmudic interpretations when they reached his standard of [[peshat]]. In his exegesis he strove for clarity and readability, as opposed to his predecessors who emphasised conciseness.&lt;ref&gt;Talmage, Frank. "Kimhi, David." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. Eds. Michael Berenbaum and Fred Skolnik. Vol. 12. 2nd ed. Detroit: Macmillan Reference USA, 2007. pp. 155–156.&lt;/ref&gt; His commentaries are said to have "a remarkably modern flavor"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ou.org/judaism-101/bios/leaders-in-the-diaspora/radak-rabbi-david-kimchi/&lt;/ref&gt; Of the Chumash, only Radak on Breishit survives.
* [[Nachmanides]] 1194–1270
:: Nachmanides (Ramban or Moses ben Nahman) was the first biblical commentator to introduce [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] concepts into his exegesis.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol 14 page 741&lt;/ref&gt; He differed from the [[Zohar]] in that he believed that the transcendent nature of God is absolutely unknowable by man, whereas the school of Zoharists believed that transcendence is comprehensible through revelation, ecstasy, and in the contemplation of history.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol 14 page 745&lt;/ref&gt; Ramban expressed his views through the [[pardes (Jewish exegesis)#Sod|Sod]] aspect of his commentary. He also expressed, in his commentary, his belief that all [[mitzvot]] had a comprehensible and rational explanation.
* [[Jacob ben Asher]] 1270–1340
:: The author of the [[Arba'ah Turim]], a precursor of the [[Shulchan Aruch]] Jacob ben Asher wrote a commentary on the Torah in which he anthologised the ''[[Pshat]]'' element of his predecessors. At the beginning of each section he wrote, as brain teasers, some explanations using ''[[kabbalah#Overview|Remez]]''. These were gathered and printed under the name ''Baal HaTurim''. The Baal HaTurim is printed in all modern editions of ''Mikraot Gedolot''. The full commentary titled ''Perush ha-Tur ha-Arokh al ha-Torah'', was published in Jerusalem in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia Judaica'' 2nd ed. vol. 11 page 31&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gersonides]] 1288–1344
:: Gersonides (The Ralbag or Levi ben Gershon) based his exegesis on three principles:
# What can be learned through the nine principles (he believed that four of them were not allowed to be used in post-talmudic times).
# Every story in the Bible come to teach us ethical, religious, and philosophical ideas.
# Most of what we call Remez can be clearly understood by resorting to exact translation and grammatical analysis. He also condemned allegorical explanation.&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstein's ''Ozer Yisrael'' vol. 6 page 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Hezekiah ben Manoah]] 13th century France
:: The Hizkuni based his kabbalistic commentary primarily on Rashi, but also used up to 20 other sources, including [[Dunash ben Labrat]].
* [[Isaac Abarbanel]] 1437–1508
:: In his commentary on Tanach, before each section, he would list a series of questions exploring the conceptual problems in the section from both exegetical and theological perspectives. His commentary would attempt to answer these questions through Pshat and Medrash. He distinguished between Medrashim that were part of Mesorah and those that were mere opinion and could be safely disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawee|first=Eric|author2=[[Avraham Grossman|Grossman, Avraham]]|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|edition=2nd|volume=1|pages=276–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acharonim (1600–) ===
{{See also|Acharonim}}
* [[Me'am Lo'ez]] 1730-1777
* [[Metsudot]] 18th century
:: The [[Metsudot]] (the fortresses) are a commentary on Neviim and Ketuvim written by Rabbi David Altshuler. When he died, his son Yechiel completed it and divided it into two sections: [[Metsudat Zion]], a glossary of difficult words, and [[Metsudat David]], a restatement of difficult ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Encyclopedia'' in the section on Altschul&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Malbim]] 1809–1879
:: The Malbim's (Meir Leibush ben Yehiel Michel Wisser) exegesis is based on several assumptions.
:# There are no extra words or synonyms in the Bible. Every word is meaningful.
:# ''Drush'' is as explicit as ''Pshat'' is, except that ''Drush'' has different rules of usage and syntax.
:# The basis of the whole of the [[Oral law]] is explicit in the Bible, either through ''Pshat'' or ''Drush''. The only exception is when the Oral Law states that the law is not found in the Bible and is designated as ''[[Halacha l'Moshe m'Sinai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfeffer|first=Jeremy L.|title=Malbim's ''Job''|publisher=KTAV|location=Jersey City NJ|pages=10–11|chapter=Translator's Introduction|isbn=0-88125-801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] 1808–1888
:: Hirsch was a German rabbi during the reformation period. His commentary focuses on the grammar and structure of the language of the Tanakh to facilitate understand the laws being given.  His commentary includes the Five Books of Moses and other various parts of the Tanakh.
* [[Torah Temimah]] 1860–1941
:: [[Baruch Epstein]] (Baruch ben Yechiel Michael HaLevi) was a bank worker by profession who devoted all of his extra time to Jewish studies. To write the Torah Temimah, he gathered excerpts from the [[Talmud]] and other sources of the Oral Law and arranged them in the order of the verses of the [[Written Law]] to which they refer. He then wove the excerpts into a commentary on the Bible and annotated each excerpt with critical notes and insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|publisher=Keter|edition=2nd|volume=6|page=468}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Nechama Leibowitz]]  1905–1997
:: In the early 1940s professor Leibowitz began mailing study sheets on the weekly Torah reading to her students throughout the world. The study sheets included essays on the weekly portion, source notes, and questions. She encouraged her students to send their answers to her for correction. Soon she was sending out thousands of sheets and correcting hundreds of answer sheets weekly. These study sheets were collected and published in English and Hebrew in the mid 1960s and they are still in print. "Her specific collection of sources was based solely on each one's contribution to understanding ''[[peshat]]'' and to the revelation of the significance of that text."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]'', second edition, volume 12, page 621&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 20th and 21st century ===
* ''Cup of Salvation'', also known as ''Cup of Salvation: A Powerful Journey Through King David's Psalms of Praise'', is a book written by [[Pesach Wolicki]] and published by the [[Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation]] (CJCUC) in 2017. The book is a devotional biblical commentary on [[Psalms]] 113-118 otherwise known as the [[Hallel]].
* The [[Soncino Books of the Bible]] covers the whole Tanakh in fourteen volumes, published by the [[Soncino Press]]. The first volume to appear was Psalms in 1945, and the last was Chronicles in 1952. The editor was Rabbi Abraham Cohen. Each volume contains the Hebrew and English texts of the Hebrew Bible in parallel columns, with a running commentary below them.
* [[Judaica Press]] is an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] publishing house. They have published a set of 24 bilingual Hebrew-English volumes of ''[[Mikraot Gedolot]]'' for Nevi'im and Ketuvim, published as Books of the Prophets and Writings. As in traditional Mikraot Gedolot, the Hebrew text includes the [[Masoretic text]], the [[Aramaic]] [[Targum]], and several classic rabbinic commentaries. The English translations, by [[Avroham Yoseif Rosenberg]] (also: Abraham Joseph Rosenberg),&lt;ref name=JPR-Rosenberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Avroham Yoseif|title=The Complete Jewish Bible, With Rashi Commentary|url=http://onlinebooks.library.upenn.edu/webbin/book/lookupid?key=olbp51235|work=The Complete Tanach With Rashi|publisher=Judaica Press|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; include a translation of the Biblical text, [[Rashi]]'s commentary, and a summary of rabbinic and modern commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.judaicapress.com/product_info.php?ref=1330&amp;products_id=47 Judaica Press Prophets &amp; Writings] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081211071116/http://www.judaicapress.com/product_info.php?ref=1330&amp;products_id=47 |date=December 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is available online as Javascript-dependent HTML document with Rashi's commentary at chabad.org – [http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm The Complete Jewish Bible with Rashi Commentary (in Hebrew and English)].&lt;ref name=JPR-online&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg|first=Avroham Yoseif|title=The Complete Jewish Bible, With Rashi Commentary (in Hebrew and English)|url=http://www.chabad.org/library/bible_cdo/aid/63255/jewish/The-Bible-with-Rashi.htm|work=Classic Texts|publisher=Judaica Press &amp; Chabad.org|accessdate=24 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[The Living Torah]]'', by [[Aryeh Kaplan]], his best-known work, is a widely used, scholarly (and user friendly) translation into English of the Torah. It is noteworthy for its detailed index, thorough cross-references, extensive footnotes with maps and diagrams, and research on [[Realia (translation)|realia]], [[flora]], [[fauna]], and [[geography]]. The footnotes also indicate differences in interpretation between the [[Jewish commentaries on the Bible#Commentaries|classic commentators]]. It was one of the first translations structured around the ''[[Parashah#Parashot in the Torah|parshiyot]]'', the traditional division of the Torah text. ''The Living Torah'' was later supplemented by ''[[The Living Torah and Nach#The Living Nach|The Living Nach]]'' on [[Nevi'im]] (two volumes: "The Early Prophets" and "The Latter Prophets") and [[Ketuvim]] ("Sacred Writings" in one volume). These were prepared posthumously following Rabbi Kaplan's format by others including Yaakov Elman.
* [[Mesorah Publications, Ltd.]] is a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Orthodox Jewish]] publishing company based in Brooklyn, New York. Its general editors are Rabbis [[Nosson Scherman]] and [[Meir Zlotowitz]]. They publish the [[Artscroll]] prayerbooks and Bible commentaries. In 1993 they published ''The Chumash: The Stone Edition'', a Torah translation and commentary arranged for liturgical use. It is popularly known as ''The ArtScroll Chumash'', and has since became the best-selling English-Hebrew Torah translation and commentary in the U.S. and other English-speaking countries. They have issued a series of Tanakh commentaries on the rest of the Tanakh. Their translations have been criticized by a few Modern Orthodox scholars, e.g. B. Barry Levy, and by some non-Orthodox scholars, as mistranslating the Bible. The dispute comes about because the editors at Mesorah Publications consciously attempt to present a translation of the text based on rabbinic tradition and medieval biblical commentators such as Rashi, as opposed to a literal translation.
* [[Koren Publishers Jerusalem]] is a Jerusalem-based publishing company founded in 1961. It publishes various editions of The Koren Tanakh, originally created by master typographer and company founder [[Eliyahu Koren]]. The Koren Tanakh is the official Tanakh accepted by the Chief Rabbinate of Israel for synagogue [[Haftarah]] reading, and the Bible upon which Israel's President is sworn into office. Koren offers a Hebrew/English edition with translation by biblical and literary scholar, Harold Fisch, and is currently at work on a Hebrew/English edition with translation and commentary by Rabbi [[Jonathan Sacks]].
* [[Da'at Miqra]] is a series of Hebrew-language biblical commentaries, published by the Jerusalem-based Rav Kook Institute. Its editors included the late Prof. Yehuda Elitzur of Bar-Ilan University, Bible scholar [[Amos Hakham]], Sha’ul Yisra’eli, [[Mordechai Breuer]] and [[Yehuda Kiel]]. The commentary combines a traditional rabbinic outlook with the findings of modern research. The editors have sought to present an interpretation based primarily upon Peshat — the direct, literal reading of the text — as opposed to Drash. They do so by incorporating geographic references, archaeological findings and textual analysis.
* ''[[Da'as Sofrim on Tanach]]'' is a 20 volume work by [[Chaim Dov Rabinowitz]] encompassing the whole of the Tanakh.  Based on the Rishonim, he spent more than 60 years compiling this massive commentary which is used for study by many talmidei chachamim and educators throughout the world.
* ''[[Kol Menachem#The Gutnick Edition Chumash|The Gutnick Edition Chumash]]'', by Rabbi Chaim Miller, is a translation that incorporates Rabbi [[Menachem Mendel Schneerson]]'s – the Rebbe's - "novel interpretation" of [[Rashi]]'s commentary. This "Toras Menachem" commentary is culled from the Rebbe's lectures and notes on classical and [[Hassidic]] interpretations. It also includes mystical insights called "Sparks of ''Chassidus''", a summary of the ''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]'' found in each ''[[Parashah]]'' according to ''[[Sefer ha-Chinuch]]''. It is unique in its presentation of "Classic Questions" - the questions underlying more than one hundred Torah commentaries.
* A second [[Lubavitch]] Chumash, [[Kehot Publication Society]]'s ''Torah Chumash'' (the "[http://www.lachumash.org/ LA Chumash]") offers an Interpolated English translation and commentary - "woven" together – again based on Rashi, and the works of the Rebbe.  The Chumash also includes a fully vocalized Hebrew text of Rashi`s commentary. The Editor-in-Chief is Rabbi [[Moshe Wisnefsky]] with contributing editors: Rabbis Baruch Kaplan, Betzalel Lifshitz, Yosef Marcus and Dov Wagner. Additional Features include "Chasidic Insights" and "Inner Dimensions", Chronological charts, topic titles, illustrations, diagrams and maps. Each sidra is prefaced by an overview, a study of the name of each sidra and its relevance to the respective text.
* A modern Orthodox [[Yeshiva]] in New York, [[Yeshivat Chovevei Torah]], recently started a new Bible series, ''Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Tanakh Companion''. The first volume out is ''Yeshivat Chovevei Torah Tanakh Companion to The Book of Samuel: Bible Study in the Spirit of Open and Modern Orthodoxy'', edited by [[Nathaniel Helfgot]] and [[Shmuel Herzfeld]].
* ''JPS Tanakh Commentary''. The [[Jewish Publication Society]], known in the Jewish community as ''JPS'', has initiated a long-term, large-scale project to complete a modern Jewish commentary on the entire Hebrew Bible. Unlike the Judaica Press and Soncino commentaries, the JPS commentaries are producing a detailed line-by-line commentary of every passage, in every book of the Bible. The amount of the JPS commentaries are almost an order of magnitude larger than those found in the earlier Orthodox English works. They currently have produced volumes on all five books of the Torah, the Haftarot, and the books of Jonah, Esther, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, and Song of Songs. Although not a book of the Bible, JPS has also issued a commentary volume on the Haggadah. The next volumes planned are Lamentations, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, &amp; Psalms (5 volumes).
* A major Bible commentary now in use by [[Conservative Judaism]] is [[Etz Hayim Humash|Etz Hayim: Torah and Commentary]], Its production involved the collaboration of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]], the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, and the Jewish Publication Society. The Hebrew and English bible text is the New JPS version. It contains a number of commentaries, written in English, on the Torah which run alongside the Hebrew text and its English translation, and it also contains a number of essays on the Torah and Tanakh in the back of the book. It contains three types of commentary: (1) the p'shat, which discusses the literal meaning of the text; this has been adapted from the first five volumes of the ''JPS Bible Commentary''; (2) the d'rash, which draws on Talmudic, Medieval, Chassidic, and Modern Jewish sources to expound on the deeper meaning of the text; and (3) the halacha l'maaseh – which explains how the text relates to current Jewish law.
* [[Leonard S. Kravitz]] and [[Kerry Olitzky]] have authored a series of Tanakh commentaries. Their commentaries draw on classical Jewish works such as the [[Mishnah]], [[Talmud]], [[Targum]]s, the [[midrash]] literature, and also the classical Jewish bible commentators such as [[Gersonides]], [[Rashi]] and [[Abraham ibn Ezra]]. They take into account modern scholarship; while these books take note of some findings of [[Higher criticism|higher textual criticism]], these are not academic books using source criticism to deconstruct the Tanakh. Rather, their purpose is educational, and Jewishly inspirational, and as such do not follow the path of classical Reform scholars, or the more secular projects such as the Anchor Bible series. The books also add a layer of commentary by modern-day rabbis. These books are published by the [[Union for Reform Judaism]]. Commentaries in this series now include Jonah, Lamentations, Ruth, the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, and Proverbs.
* ''The Jewish Study Bible'', from [[Oxford University Press]], edited by [[Adele Berlin]] and [[Marc Zvi Brettler]]. The English bible text is the New JPS version. A new English commentary has been written for the entire Hebrew Bible drawing on both traditional rabbinic sources, and the findings of modern-day higher textual criticism.
* There is much overlap between non-Orthodox Jewish Bible commentary, and the non-sectarian and inter-religious Bible commentary found in the [[Anchor Bible Series]]. Originally published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]], and now by [[Yale University Press]], this series began in 1956. Having initiated a new era of cooperation among scholars in biblical research, over 1,000 scholars—representing Jewish, Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, secular, and other traditions—have now contributed to the project.
* ''The Torah: A Women's Commentary'', Edited by [[Tamara Cohn Eskenazi]] and Andrea Weiss. [[Union for Reform Judaism|URJ]] Press (December 10, 2007).  This volume "gives dimension to the women's voices in our tradition. Under Editor Dr. Tamara Cohn Eskenazi's skillful leadership, this commentary provides insight and inspiration for all who study Torah: men and women, Jew and non-Jew. As Dr. Eskenazi has eloquently stated, 'we want to bring the women of the Torah from the shadow into the limelight, from their silences into speech, from the margins to which they have often been relegated to the center of the page – for their sake, for our sake and for our children's sake.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urjbooksandmusic.com/product.php?productid=1986|title=URJ Books And Music :: Sacred Texts :: Torah: A Women's Commentary, The|publisher=|accessdate=19 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 Weekly Torah Portions'' Edited by Rabbi Elyse Goldstein, Jewish Lights Publishing (September 2008).  From the Jewish Lights website: "In this groundbreaking book, more than 50 women rabbis come together to offer us inspiring insights on the Torah, in a week-by-week format. Included are commentaries by the first women ever ordained in the Reform, Reconstructionist and Conservative movements, and by many other women across these denominations who serve in the rabbinate in a variety of ways." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishlights.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Store_Code=JL&amp;Product_Code=978-1-58023-370-5 |title=The Women's Torah Commentary: New Insights from Women Rabbis on the 54 Weekly Torah Portions |publisher=Jewishlights.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leaving the nest''' or '''moving out''' refers to the notion of a young person moving out of the accommodation provided by their guardian, [[fosterer]]s or [[parent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Apter|first1=Terry|title=The Myth of Maturity: What Teenagers Need from Parents to Become Adults|date=2002|page=260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such a move can be motivated by various factors, including a desire for independence, the discovery of a more viable location and/or practicality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peace|first1=Sheila|title=Adult Lives: A Life Course Perspective|date=2011|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The age at which young people move out of their previous accommodation has been rising since the turn of the [[21st century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/2014/article/independence-for-young-millennials-moving-out-and-boomeranging-back.htm|title=Independence for young millennials: moving out and boomeranging back : Monthly Labor Review: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|last=R.|first=Dey,Judith G.;Pierret,Charles|website=www.bls.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures view leaving the nest as one of the key milestones in the transition from tweenhood or teenhood to becoming an adult besides obtaining employment and getting wedded.&lt;ref&gt;Furstenberg, Frank F., Ruben G. Rumbaut, and Richard A. Settersten. "On the frontier of adulthood: Emerging themes and new directions." On the frontier of adulthood: Theory, research, and public policy (2005): 3-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, especially [[Middle Eastern]] ones, it is not as socially acceptable for a woman or girl to leave the home to live by herself without a marriage arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arnett|first1=Jeffrey|title=International encyclopedia of adolescence: A-J, index, Volume 1|date=2007|page=1038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some researchers have suggested that a delay in leaving the nest may result in a decrease in [[sexual activity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/science/new-research-suggests-young-people-are-going-off-sex-1.2742803|title=New research suggests young people are going off sex|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2018-09-17|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahyar Alizadeh''' ({{lang-fa|مهیار علیزاده}} ; born 1982) is a musician and [[Tar|Taar]] player from Iran. At the age of 10, as the music influence was growing in the family, he began playing Taar, encouraged of his parents. Maestro [[Keivan Saket]] taught him to play the [[Tar|Taar]] and soon Mahyar joined his tutor as Vaziri orchestra player.

After graduating from Alborz High School, he continued his career in music university and after that, decided to study in foreign universities. First he entered Komitass Conservatory in Armenia. As it influenced his passion on music as he always quotes that his career as a musician is divided in two, before Armenia and after that.

After two years studying music composition at Armenia Conservatory, he chose [[Vienna University]] as the next stop in mastering musicology.
Then in 2009 he resumed recording his debut album in collaboration with [[Alireza Ghorbani]], an album that was begun when he was in Armenia. This album, named ''Autumn on Fire'' and labelled under Avay-e Barbad production, became the best selling Persian music album in 2011–2012.
These successes make Mahyar Alizadeh and Alireza Ghorbani’s cooperation last till today in various albums and concerts.
Among his other and recent activities are music composition for movies, TV series and animations; music composition for the album Dancing in the Flames with you cooperating with Saber Abar ; and music composition for an album in which Homayoun Shajarian and Alireza Ghorbani participated together. His latest album, Fairy-like Girl, which was published in 2015 / 1394 SH in cooperation with Alireza Ghorbani is one of the ten best-selling albums in Iran this year. Alizadeh is now working on several other projects with the voices of various singers such as Mehran Modiri and Mohammad Motamedi. His last concert was held at the Vahdat Hall in Tehran for ten nights. He will soon have several performances in Europe.

[[File:2002-10-26 11-15 (Andalusien &amp; Lissabon 263) Lissabon, Belém, Torre de Belém.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Tower of Belém]], in Lisbon, is one of the most representative examples of Manueline style.]]
[[File:View from the Cloisters in the Jerónimos Monastery.JPG|thumb|300px|Manueline ornamentation in the cloisters of [[Jerónimos Monastery]], Belem, Portugal]]

The '''Manueline''' ({{lang-pt|estilo manuelino}}, {{IPA-pt|ɨʃˈtilu mɐnweˈɫinu|IPA}}), or '''Portuguese late Gothic''', is the sumptuous, composite [[Portugal|Portuguese]] style of architectural ornamentation of the first decades of the 16th century, incorporating maritime elements and representations of the discoveries brought from the voyages of [[Vasco da Gama]] and [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]]. This innovative style synthesizes aspects of Late [[Gothic architecture]] with influences of the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Plateresque]] style, [[Mudéjar]],  [[Italy|Italian]] urban architecture, and [[Flanders|Flemish]] elements. It marks the transition from [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] to Renaissance. The construction of churches and monasteries in Manueline was largely financed by proceeds of the lucrative [[spice trade]] with Africa and India.

The style was given its name, many years later, by [[Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen]], Viscount of Porto Seguro, in his 1842 book, ''Noticia historica e descriptiva do Mosteiro de Belem, com um glossario de varios termos respectivos principalmente a architectura gothica'', in his description of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]]. Varnhagen named the style after [[Manuel I of Portugal|King Manuel I]], whose reign (1495–1521) coincided with its development. The style was much influenced by the astonishing successes of the [[Portugal in the Age of Discovery|voyages of discovery]] of Portuguese navigators, from the coastal areas of Africa to the discovery of Brazil and the ocean routes to the Far East, drawing heavily on the style and decorations of East Indian temples.

Although the period of this style did not last long (from 1490 to 1520), it played an important part in the development of Portuguese art. The influence of the style outlived the king. Celebrating the newly maritime power, it manifested itself in architecture (churches, monasteries, palaces, castles) and extended into other arts such as sculpture, painting, works of art made of precious metals, [[faience]] and furniture.

==Characteristics==
[[File:Convento Cristo December 2008-11.jpg|thumb|upright|The window of the Convent of Christ in Tomar is a well-known example of Manueline style]]
[[Image:Mosteiro dos Jeronimos - Igreja 2.jpg|thumb|upright|Manueline interior of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Lisbon]]]]

This decorative style is characterized by virtuoso complex ornamentation in portals, windows, columns and arcades. In its end period it tended to become excessively exuberant as in Tomar.

Several elements appear regularly in these intricately carved stoneworks:
* elements used on ships: the [[armillary]] sphere (a navigational instrument and the personal emblem of Manuel I and also symbol of the [[cosmos]]), spheres, anchors, anchor chains, ropes and cables.
* elements from the sea, such as shells, pearls and strings of seaweed.
* botanical motifs such as laurel branches, oak leaves, acorns, poppy capsules, corncobs, thistles.
* symbols of Christianity such as the cross of the [[Order of Christ (Portugal)|Order of Christ]] (former Templar knights), the military order that played a prominent role and helped finance the first voyages of discovery. The cross of this order decorated the sails of the Portuguese ships.
* elements from newly discovered lands (such as the tracery in the ''Claustro Real'' in the [[Monastery of Batalha]], suggesting Islamic [[filigree]] work, influenced by buildings in India)
* columns carved like twisted strands of rope
* semicircular arches (instead of Gothic pointed arches) of doors and windows, sometimes consisting of three or more convex curves
* multiple pillars
* eight-sided capitals
* lack of symmetry
* conical [[pinnacle]]s
* bevelled crenellations
* ornate portals with niches or [[canopy (building)|canopies]].

==Examples==
When King Manuel I died in 1521, he had funded 62 construction projects. However, much original Manueline architecture in Portugal was lost or damaged beyond restoration in the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] and subsequent [[tsunami]]. In [[Lisbon]], the [[Ribeira Palace]], residence of King Manuel I, and the [[Hospital Real de Todos os Santos]] (''All-Saints Hospital'') were destroyed, along with several churches. The city, however, still has outstanding examples of the style in the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] (mainly designed by [[Diogo Boitac]] and [[Juan de Castillo|João de Castilho]]) and in the small fortress of the [[Belém Tower]] (designed by [[Francisco de Arruda]]). Both are located close to each other in the [[Belém, Lisbon|Belém neighbourhood]]. The portal of the [[Church of Nossa Senhora da Conceição Velha]], in [[Baixa Pombalina|downtown Lisbon]], has also survived destruction.

[[File:Jerónimos April 2009-4.jpg|thumb|Manueline exterior of the [[Jerónimos Monastery]] in [[Lisbon]].]]
Outside Lisbon, the church and chapter house of the [[Convent of the Order of Christ]] at [[Tomar]] (designed by [[Diogo de Arruda]]) is a major Manueline monument. In particular, the large window of the chapter house, with its fantastic sculptured organic and twisted rope forms, is one of the most extraordinary achievements of the Manueline style.

Other major Manueline monuments include the arcade screens of the Royal Cloister (designed by [[Diogo Boitac]]) and the Unfinished Chapels (designed by [[Mateus Fernandes]]) at the [[Monastery of Batalha]] and the [[Palace of Sintra|Royal Palace of Sintra]].

Other remarkable Manueline buildings include the church of the [[Monastery of Jesus of Setúbal]] (one of the earliest Manueline churches, also designed by Diogo Boitac), the [[Santa Cruz Monastery]] in [[Coimbra]], the main churches in [[Golegã]], [[Vila do Conde]], [[Moura Municipality|Moura]], [[Caminha]], [[Olivenza|Olivença]] and portions of the cathedrals of [[Braga Cathedral|Braga]] (main chapel), [[Viseu]] (rib vaulting of the nave) and [[Catedral da Guarda|Guarda]] (main portal, pillars, vaulting). Civil buildings in Manueline style exist in [[Évora]] (home to the  Évora Royal Palace of 1525, by Pedro de Trillo, Diogo de Arruda and Francisco de Arruda) and the [[Castle of Évoramonte]] of 1531), [[Viana do Castelo, Portugal|Viana do Castelo]], [[Guimarães]] and some other towns.

The style was extended to the decorative arts and spread throughout the [[Portuguese Empire]], to the islands of the [[Azores]], [[Madeira]], enclaves in [[North Africa]], [[Colonial Brazil|Brazil]], [[Goa]] in [[Portuguese India]] and even [[Portuguese Macau|Macau]], China. Its influence is apparent in southern Spain, the Canary Islands, North Africa and the former Spanish colonies of Peru and Mexico.

{{refimprove|date=July 2008}}
'''Methods engineering''' is a subspecialty of [[industrial engineering]] and [[manufacturing engineering]] concerned with human integration in industrial production processes.&lt;ref name="Methods"&gt;Methods Engineering [https://archive.org/details/MethodsEngineering Reference book]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Alternatively it can be described as the design of the productive process in which a person is involved. The task of the Methods engineer is to decide where humans will be utilized in the process of converting [[raw material]]s to finished products and how workers can most effectively perform their assigned tasks.&lt;ref name="Methods"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Work Design &amp; Measurement, IE Terminology, 2000 Revised Edition&lt;/ref&gt; The terms operation analysis, work design and simplification, and methods engineering and corporate re-engineering are frequently used interchangeably.&lt;ref name="Niebel"&gt;{{cite book |last=Freivalds |first=Andris |first2=Benjamin |last2=Niebel |title=Methods, Standards, and Work Design |edition=Eleventh |location=New York |publisher=McGraw-Hill |year=2003 |isbn=0072468246 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lowering costs and increasing reliability and productivity are the objectives of methods engineering. These objectives are met in a five step sequence as follows: Project selection,  data acquisition and presentation, data analysis, development of an ideal method based on the data analysis and, finally, presentation and implementation of the method.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt;

== Methods engineering topics ==

=== Project selection ===
Methods engineers typically work on projects involving new product design, products with a high cost of production to profit ratio, and products associated with having poor quality issues. Different methods of project selection include the [[Pareto analysis]], fish diagrams, [[Gantt chart]]s, [[PERT chart]]s, and job/work site analysis guides.

=== Data acquisition and presentation ===
Data that needs to be collected are specification sheets for the product, design drawings, quantity and delivery requirements, and projections as to how the product will perform or has performed in the market. The Gantt process chart can assist in the analysis of the man to machine interaction and it can aid in establishing the optimum number of workers and machines subject to the financial constraints of the operation. A flow diagram is frequently employed to represent the manufacturing process associated with the product.

=== Data analysis ===
Data analysis enables the methods engineer to make decisions about several things, including: purpose of the operation, part design characteristics, specifications and tolerances of parts, materials, manufacturing process design, setup and tooling, working conditions, material handling, plant layout, and workplace design.&lt;ref name="Niebel"/&gt; Knowing the specifics (who, what, when, where, why, and how) of product manufacturing assists in the development of an optimum manufacturing method.

=== Ideal method development ===
Equations of synchronous and random servicing as well as line balancing are used to determine the ideal worker to machine ratio for the process or product chosen. Synchronous servicing is defined as the process where a machine is assigned to more than one operator, and the assigned operators and machine are occupied during the whole operating cycle. Random servicing of a facility, as the name indicates, is defined as a servicing process with a random time of occurrence and need of servicing variables. Line balancing equations determine the ideal number of workers needed on a production line to enable it to work at capacity.

=== Presentation and methods implementation ===
The industrial process or operation can be optimized using a variety of available methods. Each method design has its advantages and disadvantages. The best overall method is chosen using selection criteria and concepts involving [[value engineering]], [[cost-benefit analysis]], crossover charts, and economic analysis. The outcome of the selection process is then presented to the company for implementation at the plant. This last step involves "selling the idea" to the company brass, a skill the methods engineer must develop in addition to the normal engineering qualifications.

The '''Oeschger Centre for Climate and Climate Change Research''' ('''OCCR'''), is the interdisciplinary centre of excellence for climate research of the [[University of Bern]].

== History ==
[[File:icecore 4x.jpg|frame|right|Ice core sample taken from drill. Photo by [[Lonnie Thompson]], [[Byrd Polar Research Center]]]]

The centre was established in 2007 and was named after [[Hans Oeschger]] (1927-1998), a pioneer of modern [[climate research]], who worked in [[Bern]]. The OCCR brings together researchers from nine institutes and four faculties. It has more than 200 members working in 26 research groups. The OCCR is at the forefront of international research in a number of different fields. Researchers from the University of Bern have participated as co-chair, coordinating lead authors or lead authors in all the assessment reports so far published by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/publications_and_data/publications_and_data_reports.shtml#1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, Assessment Reports]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them are still working today at the OCCR. In addition to research within disciplines, the OCCR puts special emphasis on interdisciplinary projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/intranet/documentation/oeschger_broch_en.pdf Oeschger Centre Booklet]&lt;/ref&gt; Regionally rooted and globally linked, the OCCR hopes to find ways to meet the challenge of [[global climate change]] at many different levels through the collaboration of experts in the natural, human and social sciences, in economics and law. The OCCR is active not only in research; it is also involved in teaching and runs the Graduate School of Climate Sciences.

== Overview ==

=== Research ===
The Oeschger Centre (OCCR) conducts research on the one hand into the long-term development and dynamics of the climate system and the climate of the present and the future. On the other hand, it investigates the impact of climate change on important land ecosystems as well as on the economy and society. In particular it works on strategies to adapt to the changing climate and to slow down climate change. At the centre of the OCCR's research is the climate system and its interaction with society and the economy.

Specific areas of research include:
* the climate system with its different interactive components in the oceans, continents (especially vegetation, the [[cryosphere]], aquatic systems, etc.) and in the atmosphere
* energy and material cycles (e.g. water, carbon and greenhouse gases) from the global to the local level.
* the dynamics of the climate and environment over long periods of time ([[palaeoclimatology]], [[palaeoecology]]) from the late [[Pleistocene]], [[Holocene]] and the present day to the near future
* the interaction of changes in the climate and environment with the economy and society, in particular the economics of climate change and the consequences of extreme events on the economy and society

The Oeschger Centre uses models of varying kinds and complexity, and also takes measurements and carries out reconstructions of important climate variables (e.g. natural and man-made radiative forcing).

=== Teaching ===
The Oeschger Centre runs the University of Bern's Graduate School of Climate Sciences &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/ Graduate School of Climate Sciences Webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; and offers academic training to MSc and PhD level. For the specialist "MSc in Climate Sciences" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/msc_programme/documents/index_en.html Documents and Guidelines «MSc in Climate Sciences»] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121220011009/http://www.climatestudies.unibe.ch/msc_programme/documents/index_en.html |date=2012-12-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (120 ECTS), applicants have to pass through a selection process. Students put together their own curriculum by selecting courses from a range of topics offered by several different faculties. The selection can lead to any one of five specialisations. The OCCR's main areas of research are reflected in the curriculum of the courses offered by the Graduate School of Climate Sciences.

The Oeschger Centre has a decidedly international outlook in its teaching, and works closely with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich. More than a third of its students come from abroad, and all teaching is conducted in English. The PhD programme is strongly research-orientated, and lasts for three to four years. Students with a degree from the Graduate School of Climate Sciences may take up academic careers, work in the private sector – for example in banks or in insurance – or in the environmental sector for the government or with non-governmental organisations.

== Structure ==

=== Organisation ===
The Oeschger Centre for Climate Research (OCCR) is an interdisciplinary centre at the University of Bern, made up of research groups from the participating institutes. Administratively it is part of the Faculty of Science. The OCCR received its mandate from the university's governing body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oeschger.unibe.ch/intranet/documents/LA20080129.pdf University of Bern, mandate of the governing body (German Only)]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The president, director and a scientific committee made up of representatives of the participating faculties and institutes are responsible for the strategic management of the OCCR. The OCCR is run by a management centre which encourages collaboration between the research groups,  provides services for the researchers and publicises the work of the OCCR.

'''Painting conservation''' is the multidisciplinary and skilled technical practice of conserving and restoring [[paintings]] comprising the three core specialisms of [[easel painting conservation]]&lt;ref&gt;Hill Stoner, J. and Rushfield, R. (Eds.) (2012). Conservation of Easel Paintings, New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[wall painting conservation]] and the [[conservation of works on paper]]. Skills, technical approach, relevant scientific knowledge and ethical considerations vary across the specialisms, which each tend to have distinct training programmes and practice groups. Painting conservators recruit knowledge and skills from fields including [[art history]], [[fine art]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[physics]] and [[environmental science]]. The process of restoring a painting may, in some instances, return its appearance to a likely original state, as intended by the artist when it was first created. However, in reality, remediating restoration treatments and conservation techniques achieve a spectrum of possible outcomes appropriate to the nature of the damage and deterioration, the fabric and materials of the artwork, historical period and ethical factors. A broad range of treatments can be carried out on easel paintings including the structural repair of canvas that has been torn or degraded by ageing&lt;ref&gt;Bustin, M. and Caley, T. (Eds.) (2003). Alternatives to Lining: Structural Treatment of Paintings on Canvas without Lining, London: UKIC.&lt;/ref&gt; the removal of dirt, cleaning of discoloured varnishes and the infilling and in-painting (or retouching) paint losses. A [[preventive conservation]] approach may also be taken, involving secondary protective measures such as installing moisture barriers to the reverse of frames, [[UV light]] protective glazing or stretcher bar linings&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tate.org.uk/research/publications/tate-papers/02/paintings-on-canvas-lining-and-alternatives#footnote19_7jx14r1&lt;/ref&gt;,  to protect paintings from further deterioration.

'''Pathos''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|eɪ|θ|ɒ|s}}, {{IPAc-en|US|ˈ|p|eɪ|θ|oʊ|s}}; plural: ''pathea''; {{Lang-el|[[wiktionary:πάθος|πάθος]]}}, for "[[suffering]]" or "[[experience]]"; [[adjective|adjectival]] form: ''pathetic'' from {{lang|el|παθητικός}}) [[appeal to emotion|appeals to the emotions]] of the audience and elicits [[feeling]]s that already reside in them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMXxhuVU-SYC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=Pathos+emotional+appeal&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tUnbULPeFaeD4gT82YGgBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pathos%20emotional%20appeal&amp;f=false |title=Strategic Business Communication: For Leaders |author=Robyn Walker |publisher=Google Books |date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathos is a communication technique used most often in [[rhetoric]] (in which it is considered one of the three [[modes of persuasion]], alongside [[ethos]] and [[logos]]), as well as in literature, film, and other narrative art.

[[Emotion]]al appeal can be accomplished in many ways, such as the following:
* by a [[metaphor]] or [[storytelling]], commonly known as a [[hook (rhetoric)|hook]];
* by [[passion (emotion)|passion]] in the delivery of the speech or writing, as determined by the audience; and
* by personal [[anecdote]].

==Aristotle’s text on pathos==
In ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', [[Aristotle]] identifies three artistic modes of persuasion, one of which is "awakening emotion (pathos) in the audience so as to induce them to make the judgment desired."&lt;ref name=CivDis&gt;Aristotle, and George Alexander Kennedy. ''Aristotle On Rhetoric: A Theory of Civic Discourse''. New York: Oxford UP, 1991. Print. p.119&lt;/ref&gt; In the first chapter, he includes the way in which "men change their opinion in regard to their judgment. As such, emotions have specific causes and effects" (Book 2.1.2–3).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; Aristotle identifies pathos as one of the three essential modes of proof by his statement that "to understand the emotions—that is, to name them and describe them, to know their causes and the way in which they are excited (1356a24–1356a25).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; Aristotle posits that, alongside pathos, the speaker must also deploy good [[ethos]] in order to establish credibility (Book 2.1.5–9).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt;

Aristotle details what individual emotions are useful to a speaker (Book 2.2.27).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt; In doing so, Aristotle focused on whom, toward whom, and why, stating that "[i]t is not enough to know one or even two of these points; unless we know all three, we shall be unable to arouse anger in anyone. The same is true of the other emotions." He also arranges the emotions with one another so that they may counteract one another. For example, one would pair sadness with happiness (Book 2.1.9).&lt;ref name=CivDis/&gt;

With this understanding, Aristotle argues for the [[rhetor]] to understand the entire situation of goals and audiences to decide which specific emotion the speaker would exhibit or call upon in order to persuade the audience. Aristotle’s theory of pathos has three main foci: the frame of mind the audience is in, the variation of emotion between people, and the influence the rhetor has on the emotions of the audience. Aristotle classifies the third of this trio as the ultimate goal of pathos.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aristotle|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=On Rhetoric|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|location=New York|edition=Second}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Aristotle outlines the individual importance of persuasive emotions, as well as the combined effectiveness of these emotions on the audience. Moreover, Aristotle pointedly discusses pleasure and pain in relation to the reactions these two emotions cause in an audience member.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"/&gt; According to Aristotle, emotions vary from person to person. Therefore, he stresses the importance of understanding specific social situations in order to successfully utilize pathos as a mode of persuasion.&lt;ref name="On Rhetoric"/&gt;

Aristotle identifies the introduction and the conclusion as the two most important places for an emotional appeal in any persuasive argument.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Irving|title=Some Conceptions on Emotional Appeal in Rhetorical Theory|journal=Speech Monographs|year=1939|volume=6|issue=1|pages=66–86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathos in politics ===
Pathos has its hand in politics as well, primarily in speech and how to persuade the audience. Mshvenieradze states that "Pathos is directly linked with an audience. Audience is a collective subject of speakers on which an orator tries to impact by own argumentation." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA353321541&amp;asid=9d2bc550dad3214ec473c84fe078fe62.&amp;authCount=1|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org|access-date=2017-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to how Aristotle discusses how to effectively utilize pathos in rhetoric, the way in which one appeals to the reader is similar in appealing to an audience of voters. In the case of politics and politicians, it is primarily more in argumentative writing and speaking. In Book II of Aristotle's writing's in ''Rhetoric,'' in essence knowing people's emotions helps to enable one to act with words versus writing alone, to earn another's credibility and faith.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

As Aristotle's teachings expanded, many other groups of thinkers would go on to adopt different variations of political usage with the elements of pathos involved, which includes groups such as the Epicureans and Stoics.

==Alternative views on pathos==
Scholars have discussed the different interpretations of Aristotle’s views of [[rhetoric]] and his philosophy. Some believe that it is actually a myth, that Aristotle invented it entirely.{{clarify|date=May 2016}} In the second chapter of ''[[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|Rhetoric]]'', Aristotle's view on pathos changes from the use in discourse to the understanding of emotions and their effects. William Fortenbaugh pointed out that for the [[Sophist]] [[Gorgias]], "Being overcome with emotion is analogous to rape."&lt;ref name=ArisRhetEmo&gt;Fortenbaugh, ''W. W. Aristotle's Rhetoric on Emotions''. Metuchen, NJ: Scarecrow, 1974. Print. p.232.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle opposed this view and created a systematic approach to pathos. Fortenbaugh argues that Aristotle's systematic approach to emotional appeals "depends upon correctly understanding the nature of individual emotions, upon knowing the conditions favorable to, the objects of, and the grounds for individual emotions".&lt;ref name=ArisRhetEmo/&gt;

Modern philosophers were typically more skeptical of the use of emotions in communication, with political theorists such as [[John Locke]] hoping to extract emotion from reasoned communication entirely. [[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]] presents another view unlike the common systematic approach of Aristotle. Campbell explored whether appeals to emotion or passions would be "an unfair method of persuasion," identifying seven circumstances to judge emotions: probability, plausibility, importance, proximity in time, connection of place, relations to the persons concerned, and interest in the consequences.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, George, and Lloyd F. Bitzer. ''The Philosophy of Rhetoric''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois UP, 1963. Print.p.81-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 84 BC ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' book of an unknown author theorizes that the conclusion is the most important place in a persuasive argument to consider emotions such as mercy or hatred, depending on the nature of the persuasion.&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anonymous|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=Rhetorica ad Herennium|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St.Martins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "appeal to pity", as it is classified in ''Rhetorica ad Herennium'', is a means to conclude by reiterating the major premise of the work and tying while incorporating an emotional sentiment. The author suggests ways in which to appeal to the pity of the audience: "We shall stir pity in our hearers by recalling vicissitudes of future; by comparing the prosperity we once enjoyed with our present adversity; by entreating those whose pity we seek to win, and by submitting ourselves to their mercy."&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"/&gt; Additionally, the text impresses the importance of invoking kindness, humanity and sympathy upon the hearer. Finally, the author suggests that the appeal to pity be brief for "nothing dries more quickly than a tear."&lt;ref name="Rhetorica ad Herennium"/&gt;

=== Other Hellenistic Groups ===
Aristotle's teachings would go on to influence many influential groups of thinkers. One such group of thinkers, the Epicureans who practiced Epicureanism, interpreted and placed pathos in much more colloquial means and situations. The group would place pathos in pleasure, and study it in almost every facet in regards to pleasure, analyzing emotional specificity that an individual may feel or may need to undergo to appreciate said pathos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warren|first=James|title=Epicureans and Cyrenaics on pleasure as a pathos|url=https://www.academia.edu/4695271/Epicureans_and_Cyrenaics_on_pleasure_as_a_pathos|journal=forthcoming in S. Marchand and F. Verde eds. Épicurisme et scepticisme, Rome: Sapienza Università Editrice: 127–44|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pathos before Aristotle==

The concept of emotional appeal existed in rhetoric long before Aristotle’s ''Rhetoric''. [[George A. Kennedy (classicist)|George A. Kennedy]], a well-respected, modern-day scholar, identifies the appeal to emotions in the newly formed democratic court system before 400 BC in his book, ''The Art of Persuasion in Greece''.&lt;ref name="The Art of Persuasion in Greece"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennedy|first1=George|title=The Art of Persuasion in Greece|date=1963|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gorgias]], a Sophist who preceded Aristotle, was interested in the orator’s emotional appeal as well. Gorgias believed the orator was able to capture and lead the audience in any direction they pleased through the use of emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="The Art of Persuasion in Greece"/&gt; In the ''Encomium of Helen'', Gorgias states that a soul can feel a particular sentiment on account of words such as sorrow and pity. Certain words act as "bringers-on of pleasure and takers-off of pain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gorgias|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Bruce|first3=Herzberg|title=The Rhetorical Tradition (Second Edition). Encomium of Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Gorgias equates emotional persuasion to the sensation of being overtaken by a drug: "[f]or just as different drug draw off different humors from the body, and some put an end to disease and other to life, so too of discourses: some give pain, others delight, others terrify, others rouse the hearers to courage, and yet others by a certain vile persuasion drug and trick to soul."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Plato]] also discussed emotional appeal in rhetoric. Plato preceded Aristotle and therefore laid the groundwork, as did other Sophists, for Aristotle to theorize the concept of pathos. In his dialogue ''[[Gorgias (dialogue)|Gorgias]]'', Plato discusses pleasure versus pain in the realm of pathos though in a fictional conversation between Gorgias and Socrates. The dialogue between several ancient rhetors that Plato created centers around the value of rhetoric, and the men incorporate aspects of pathos in their responses. Gorgias discredits pathos and instead promotes the use of [[ethos]] in persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=The Rhetorical Tradition Second Edition). Gorgias|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another of Plato’s texts, ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', his discussion of emotions is more pointed; however, he still does not outline exactly how emotions manipulate an audience.&lt;ref name="Bedford/ St. Martin's"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plato|last2=Bizzell|first2=Patricia|last3=Herzberg|first3=Bruce|title=The Rhetorical Tradition (Second Edition). Phaedrus|date=2001|publisher=Bedford/ St. Martin's|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plato discusses the danger of emotions in oratory. He argues that emotional appeal in rhetoric should be used as the means to an end and not the point of the discussion.&lt;ref name="Bedford/ St. Martin's"/&gt;

==Contemporary pathos==
[[George Campbell (minister)|George Campbell]], a contributor to the Scottish Enlightenment, was one of the first rhetoricians to incorporate scientific evidence into his theory of emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Norman|title=Feeling and Emotion: A History of Theories|date=1937|publisher=American Book Co.|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Campbell relied heavily on a book written by physician [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]], entitled ''[[Observations on Man]]''. The book synthesized emotions and neurology and introduced the concept that action is a result of impression. Hartley determined that emotions drive people to react to appeals based on circumstance but also passions made up of cognitive impulses.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"/&gt; Campbell argues that belief and persuasion depend heavily on the force of an emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="SIU Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Golden|first1=James|last2=Corbett|first2=Edward|title=The Rhetoric of Blair, Campbell, and Whately|date=1990|publisher=SIU Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Campbell introduced the importance of the audience’s imagination and will on emotional persuasion that is equally as important as basic understanding of an argument.&lt;ref name="SIU Press"/&gt; Campbell, by drawing on the theories of rhetoricians before him, drew up a contemporary view of pathos that incorporates the psychological aspect of emotional appeal.

An orator’s reliance on emotional appeal is evident in modern-day speechmaking, but in some schools of thought this is seen primarily as psychological versus emotional appeal.&lt;ref name="American Book Co"/&gt;{{clarify|date=May 2016}}

=== Speech ===
Speech is one of the primary places where one sees the application of pathos. Pathos is in essence the driving force behind an argument, to hit the emotional pangs that allow the audience to relate to the speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org/ps/i.do?p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;u=lincclin_pbcc&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;id=GALE%7CA503310627&amp;asid=c070d952c2a30962a72ca6167914c0f4|title=LINCCWeb Catalog Search|website=go.galegroup.com.db19.linccweb.org|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Any emotional response from the audience correlates to pathos used by the director. Pathos can also be utilized for manipulation and propaganda purposes and is very prevalent within the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theoriebuero.org/2089/defending-pathos-in-film-eisenstein/|title=Defending Pathos In Film {{!}} Theoriebüro - Zur Förderung kritischer Gesellschaftstheorie und emanzipatorischer Praxis|website=theoriebuero.org|language=de-DE|access-date=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Wiktionary|philogyny}}

'''Philogyny''' is fondness, love, or admiration towards [[women]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t140.e58312|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|title=philogynist – The Oxford Dictionary of English (2nd edition revised) – Oxford Reference Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wordnet"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=philogyny|title=WordNet|publisher=[[Princeton University]]|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[antonym]] is ''[[misogyny]]''. Philogyny is not be confused with [[gynephilia]], which is [[sexual attraction]] to women or [[femininity]] (and whose antonym is ''[[gynophobia]]'').

Cicero reports the word could be used in Greek philosophy to denote being overly fond of women, which was considered a disease along with misogyny.&lt;ref name="Deming"&gt;A recent critical text with translation is in [https://books.google.com/books?id=u_6a-sMDv6AC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;lpg=PA221&amp;dq=appendix+a+antipater+of+tarsus&amp;source=web&amp;ots=JlCnsyRBGf&amp;sig=7zsKzMVEBnV3tHag9z7E4cWCeLs&amp;hl=en Appendix A] to Will Deming, ''Paul on Marriage and Celibacy: The Hellenistic Background of 1 Corinthians 7'', pp. 221–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

Christian Groes-Green has argued that the conceptual content of philogyny must be developed as an alternative to the concept of misogyny. Criticizing [[R.W. Connell]]'s theory of hegemonic masculinities he shows how philogynous masculinities play out among youth in Maputo, Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;Groes-Green, C. 2012. "Philogynous masculinities: Contextualizing alternative manhood in Mozambique". Men and Masculinities 15(2):91–111. http://jmm.sagepub.com/content/15/2/91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
''Philogyny'' comes from ''philo-'' (loving) and Greek ''gynē'' (woman). The parallel [[Greek language|Greek]]-based terms with respect to men (males) are [[philandry]] for "fondness towards men" and [[misandry]] for "hatred of men". Parallel terms for humanity generally are [[philanthropy]] and [[misanthropy]].

The '''Philosophy of Science Association''' ('''PSA''') is an American academic organization which promotes the study and discussion of the [[philosophy of science]].

Founded in 1933, the PSA engages in activities such as the publishing of periodicals, essays and [[monograph]]s in the field of the philosophy of science; sponsoring conventions and meetings; and the awarding of prizes for distinguished work in the field. In 2012, it began presenting the '''Hempel Award''', named for the eminent 20th-century philosopher of science [[Carl Gustav Hempel]], for lifetime achievement in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philsci.org/2-uncategorised/221-hempel-award-recipients Hempel Award recipients]&lt;/ref&gt; The first recipient was [[Bas van Fraassen]].

The President during 2015/2016 is [[C. Kenneth Waters]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11255">'''Predicted outcome value theory''' introduced in 1986 by Michael Sunnafrank, posits that people seek information in initial [[interactions]] and relationships to determine the benefits of [[interpersonal relationships]] by predicting the [[Value (economics)|value]] of future outcomes whether negative or positive.  If a person predicts a positive outcome in the relationship this can lead to increased [[Interpersonal attraction|attraction]], however if a person predicts a negative outcome then he or she would pursue limited interaction or possibly relationship termination.&lt;ref name=Littlejohn2&gt;Littlejohn, S. (2002). Theories of human communication. (7th Edition). China: Wadsworth Group.&lt;/ref&gt;  The processes of predicted outcome value directly link to continued relationship development and communication as well as stronger attraction and intimacy within the relationship.

Predicted outcome value theory proposes that initial interaction behaviors serve two related functions in individuals' attempts to maximize future relational outcomes. First, communication is directed at reducing uncertainty (Berger &amp; Calabrese, 1975) about new acquaintances to determine likely outcome-values for the relational future. Second, communication proceeds in a manner predicted to result in the most positive outcomes. In a broad sense, these outcome value predictions would lead to communicative attempts to terminate or curtail the conversation, to continue the entry-level conversation, or to escalate the conversation and relationship beyond this level. Attempts to continue or escalate would result from positive predicted outcome values, while attempts to terminate or curtail would result from negative predictions. Given this, predicted outcome value theory proposes that several specific behaviors associated with conversational termination-escalation should be related to predicted outcome value levels.
Among these, Sunnafrank (1986) posits that predicted outcome value is positively related to amount of verbal communication, intimacy level of communication content, nonverbal affiliative expressiveness, and liking.&lt;ref name="Sunnafrank, Michael 1988"&gt;Sunnafrank, Michael (1988). "Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations." Communication Research Reports, Vol 5. No 2, 169-172.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Key propositions of predicted outcome value theory==

1. Attraction increases as the predicted outcome value increases&lt;br /&gt;
2. Prediction of positive future outcomes leads to future [[interactions]]&lt;br /&gt;
3. Prediction of negative future outcomes ends future interactions&lt;br /&gt;
4. People focus and discuss topics in conversations that facilitate positive predicted outcomes&lt;ref name=Berger1&gt;Berger, C., Roloff, M., &amp; Roskos-Ewoldsen, D. (2010). The handbook of communication science. (2nd Edition). London: Sage Publication, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related==
Predicted outcome value theory is an alternative to [[uncertainty reduction theory]], which [[Charles Berger (academic)|Charles R. Berger]] and Richard J. Calabrese introduced in 1975. Uncertainty reduction theory states that the driving force in initial interactions is to collect information to predict [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] and [[behaviors]] for future relationship development.

Sunnafrank challenges [[uncertainty]] reduction theory with his predicted outcome value theory in that initial interactions are not solely about reducing uncertainty within the relationship but motivated by the predicted outcome value. Sunnafrank ascertains that initial interactions only lead to continued relationship development after the person has determined future rewards and costs of that relationship.

==Theory developer==
Michael Sunnafrank is a Professor in the Department of Communication, College of Liberal Arts at the [[University of Minnesota, Duluth]]. He joined the faculty at UMD in 1990 after fourteen years of teaching and research at [[Michigan State University]], [[University of California Davis]], [[Arizona State University]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. He was awarded his PhD and master's degrees by Michigan State University.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.d.umn.edu/comm/facultystaff/msunnafrank.php&lt;/ref&gt;
Sunnafrank continues to work on research testing predicted outcome value theory.

==Empirical support for predicted outcome value theory==
Sunnafrank's (1986) study examined a potential initial acquaintance association between perceived similarity and attraction may be present, though undetected, in previous interpersonal goals research and finds support for interpersonal goals claims regarding the perceived similarity/attraction relationship.
The findings extended Sunnafrank (1983, 1984, 1985) and Sunnafrank and Miller's (1981) claim that attitude similarity and attraction are unassociated in beginning communicative relationships. While their research supports this claim for attitude similarity revealed in pre-acquaintance, it also shows that this claim generalizes to more normally occurring perceptions of attitude similarity produced during initial relational stages. The results strongly suggested that traditional beliefs about, and theoretical interpretations of, the attitude similarity/attraction association are incorrect, at least regarding the initial acquaintance period.&lt;ref&gt;Sunnafrank, Michael (Spring 1986). "Communicative Influences on Perceived Similarity and Attraction: An Expansion of the Interpersonal
Goals Perspective." ''The Western Journal of Speech Communication,'' 50, 158-170.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study, "Predicted Outcome Value in Initial Conversations", provided the initial test of several predicted outcome value theory (Sunnafrank, 1986) propositions. Findings supported all hypotheses tested, and demonstrated that during initial conversations predicted outcome value is strongly and positively related to the amount of verbal communication, intimacy of communication content, nonverbal affiliation, liking and perceived similarity.&lt;ref name="Sunnafrank, Michael 1988"/&gt;

More recent research was designed to investigate positive and negative predictors of possible relationships by focusing on decisions to engage in future dates. [[Interpersonal attraction]], [[homophily]], and nonverbal immediacy have been linked to the predicted outcome value of relationships during initial encounters. This study investigates how these variables influence date decisions in a six-minute speed-dating experience. Results indicated [[interpersonal attraction]] and nonverbal immediacy significantly predict predicted outcome value, but not future date decisions.&lt;ref&gt;Houser, Marian L. Horan, Sean M. Furler, Lisa A. (2008). "Dating in the fast lane: How communication predicts speed-dating success." ''[[Journal of Social and Personal Relationships]]'', Vol. 25, No. 5, 749-768.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Featured research and theory development==

Michael Sunnafrank and Artemio Ramirez Jr., assistant professor of communication at [[Ohio State University]], conducted research which was published in the ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'' in 2004 and also featured on [[ABC news]]. Sunnafrank and Ramirez studied 164 college freshmen over a nine-week period to determine the predicted outcome value of relationship development between strangers.&lt;ref name =Sunnafrank&gt;Sunnafrank, M. &amp; Ramirez, A., (2004). "At First Sight: Persistent Relational Effects of Get-Acquainted Conversations.” ''Journal of Social and Personal Relationships'', Vol. 21. pp. 361-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

The study involved pairing two students of the same [[sex]] together the first day of class and introducing one another and then engaging in [[conversation]] for either three, six, or 10 minutes.  Afterwards, researchers asked each student to predict the outcome of the [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] by describing it as a nodding [[acquaintance]], casual acquaintance, acquaintance, close acquaintance, friend, and close friend.   The students also completed extensive questionnaires about the other person to determine how much they liked one another (Sunnafrank &amp; Ramirez, 2004).

Over the nine-week period, Sunnafrank and Ramirez (2004) facilitated a classroom environment that allowed the students to continue to get to know one another. At the end of the nine weeks, those students who predicted positive outcomes developed strong relationships and their [[behavior]] indicated such as those students sat together in class and communicated on a regular basis. The strongest effect of the study existed in the relationships where there was a predicted negative outcome.  If students decided after the initial [[interaction]] that they did not want the relationship to progress then the students acted accordingly by restricting conversation, avoiding [[eye contact]], and avoiding each other period.
 
Ramirez points out that there is power in first impressions. “People want to quickly determine if a person they just met is someone they are going to want to hang out with, or date, or spend more time with in the future. We don’t want to waste our time.”&lt;ref name =Grabmeier&gt;Grabmeier, J. (2004). "First 10 minutes after meeting may guide future of relationship". Research Communications. Columbus, OH: Ohio State University. http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/1stimpre.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

One important point to consider about this study is that Sunnafrank says that college freshmen can be “aggressive” in pursuing new friendships and relationships within social circles and that behavior tends to change over time. “In most situations in life, our time is pretty much claimed by work and family matters, so even when you meet people you really like, chances are not much is going to happen.  As life goes on and social networks become solidified, acting on that first impression becomes less likely.”&lt;ref name =Dye&gt;Dye, L. (2004). "First impressions really matter". ABCNEWS.COM. http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=69942&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunnafrank concluded that other events throughout the course of relationships can change the predicted outcome value, which he calls “surprising events,” such as betraying one another’s trust by “back stabbing” and that not all relationships turn out as originally predicted. However, in this study, it is apparent that initial impressions and interactions can determine the outcome of the relationship, which is the predicted outcome value theory. While the college freshmen had numerous opportunities to develop their relationships over the nine-week period, the first impressions made lasting impacts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4904">'''Product stewardship''' is where environmental, health, and safety protection centers on the product itself, and everyone involved in the lifespan of the product is called upon to take up responsibility to reduce its environmental, health, and safety impacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/epr/ The United States Environment Protection Agency]&lt;/ref&gt;  For manufacturers, this includes planning for, and if necessary, paying for the recycling or disposal of the product at the end of its useful life. This may be achieved, in part, by redesigning products to use fewer harmful substances, to be more durable, reusable and recyclable, and to make products from recycled materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro The National Chemical Emergency Centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070528102118/http://www.the-ncec.com/productstewardship/intro/ |date=2007-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For retailers and consumers, this means taking an active role in ensuring the proper disposal or recycling of an end-of-life product.

Those who advocate it are concerned with the later phases of [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|product lifecycle]] and the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole production process.  It is considered a pre-requisite to a strict [[service economy]] interpretation of (fictional, national, legal) "commodity" and "product" relationships.

The most familiar example is the [[container-deposit legislation]].  A fee is paid to buy the bottle, separately from the fee to buy what it contains.  If the bottle is returned, the fee is returned, and the supplier must return the bottle for re-use or [[recycling]].  If not, the collected fee can be used to pay for [[landfill]] or [[litter]] control measures.  Also, since the same fee can be collected by anyone finding and returning the bottle, it is common for people to collect these and return them as a means of surviving.  This is quite common for instance among [[homeless]] people in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.

However, the principle is applied very broadly beyond bottles to [[paint]] and [[automobile]] parts such as [[tire]]s.  When purchasing paint or tires in many places, one simultaneously pays for the disposal of the [[toxic waste]] they become.  In some countries, such as [[Germany]], [[law]] requires attention to the [[comprehensive outcome]] of the whole extraction, production, distribution, use and waste of a product, and holds those profiting from these legally responsible for any outcome along the way.  This is also the trend in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[European Union|EU]] generally.  In the [[United States]], the issue has been confronted via [[class action suit|class action lawsuits]] that attempt to hold companies [[Legal liability|liable]] for the environmental impact of their products.  Thus far, such as [[litigation]] or proposed [[accounting reform]]s such as [[full cost accounting]] have not gained much traction for the product stewardship concept in the United States beyond the realm of [[academe]] and corporate [[public relations]] (derisively referred to as [[greenwashing]]). 

The [[Demand|demand-side]] approach [[ethical consumerism]], supported by consumer education and information about environmental impacts, may approach some of the same outcomes as product stewardship.

== Extended producer responsibility ==

Product Stewardship is often used interchangeably with [[Extended producer responsibility]], a similar concept. However, there are distinct differences between the two, as suggested by the semantics of the different terms used. 

While both concepts bring the onus of waste management for end-of-life products from the government to the manufacturers, Product Stewardship further extends this responsibility to everyone involved in the life-cycle of the product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html Waste to Wealth] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310194722/http://www.ilsr.org/recycling/epr/index.html |date=2012-03-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes not only the manufacturers, but also the retailers, consumers and recyclers as well.

'''Robin A Williams''' (born 13 November 1952 in [[London]]) is a Professor of Social Research on Technology at the [[University of Edinburgh]], Scotland, and director of the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]]. He is an interdisciplinary researcher in the field of Science and Technology Studies and contributed much to the [[social shaping of technology]] by studying the interplay between 'social' and 'technical' factors in the design and implementation of a range of technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Staff Profiles|url=http://www.stis.ed.ac.uk/staff_profiles/williams_robin|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
After studying Natural Sciences and Social and Political Science at the University of Cambridge, Robin Williams took an MSc and PhD at [[Aston University]] and worked as research fellow in the Technology Policy Unit until 1986. He then joined the Research Centre for Social Sciences (RCSS) at the University of Edinburgh and coordinated the Edinburgh PICT Centre, one of the six university research centres established under the ESRC Programme on Information and Communications Technologies (1986 - 1995).&lt;ref&gt;Melody, William H (1987). "Innovative research in support of more informed decision making", ''Aslib Proceedings'', 39(6)&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Robin Williams and other researchers in Edinburgh PICT Centre published on issues regarding social, economic and political aspects of the design and implementation of technology.&lt;ref&gt;PICT Report (1994). "Edinburgh PICT Centre 1987-1994 End of Award Report", ''University of Edinburgh''&lt;/ref&gt; Concluding the findings of a decade's research Robin Williams and David Edge published a notable paper on the ‘broad church’ of [[social shaping of technology]].&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Robin, and David Edge (1996). "The social shaping of technology", ''Research policy'', 25(6)&lt;/ref&gt; He became director of RCSS in 1997.

In 2000 Robin Williams established the [[Institute for the Study of Science, Technology and Innovation]] (ISSTI) to bring together groups of academics and individual researchers across the [[University of Edinburgh]] who are involved in research, teaching and knowledge transfer on social and policy aspects of science, technology and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISSTI - About the Institute|url=http://www.issti.ed.ac.uk/about|publisher=University of Edinburgh|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was co-director of ESRC Innogen Centre from 2002-2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innogen|url=http://www.genomicsnetwork.ac.uk/innogen/people/academicstaff/forename,2414,en.html|publisher=Genomicsnetwork|accessdate=5 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 he arranged the merger of RCSS and the Science Studies Unit to form the Science, Technology and Innovation Studies subject group in the [[University of Edinburgh School of Social and Political Science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Williams,Robin (2016).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15585">Many engineering educators see [[service-learning]] as the solution to several prevalent problems in engineering education today.  In the past, engineering curriculum has fluctuated between emphasizing engineering science to focusing more on practical aspects of engineering.  Today, many engineering educators are concerned their students do not receive enough practical knowledge of engineering and its context.  Some speculate that adding context to engineering help to motivate engineering students' studies and thus improve retention and diversity in engineering schools.  Others feel that the teaching styles do not match the learning styles of engineering students.  

Many engineering faculty members believe the educational solution lies in taking a more constructivist approach, where students construct knowledge and connections between nodes of knowledge as opposed to passively absorbing knowledge.  Educators see service-learning as a way to both implement a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] in engineering education as well as match the teaching styles to the learning styles of typical engineering students.  As a result, many engineering schools have begun to integrate service-learning into their curricula.

==History==

The end of World War II marked the beginning of a movement toward increased emphasis on engineering science in engineering education.  Initially, this movement enhanced the quality of engineering education.  However, after decades of rising focus on science engineering, undergraduate [[engineering education]] began to lack instruction on practical engineering applications.  Concurrently, the undergraduate engineering experience became increasingly fragmented.&lt;ref name="fromm"&gt;E. Fromm, ''The Changing Engineering Education Paradigm,'' J. Eng. Educ., vol. 92, April 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  As one author described it, "Schools break knowledge and experience into subjects, relentlessly turning wholes into parts, flowers into petals, history into events, without ever restoring continuity."&lt;ref&gt;M. Ferguson, ''The Aquarian Conspiracy: Personal and Social Transformation in the 1980s'', St. Martin's Press, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, many different organizations, including both research institutions and professional associations, conducted studies in attempts to resolve the educational problems in the engineering field.  Though they conducted their research independently, they arrived at several common conclusions.  Researchers agreed that the engineering schools should continue to provide solid basic theory knowledge.  However, they also called for added emphasis on synthesis and design understanding as well as increased exposure to societal context and interdisciplinary teamwork.&lt;ref name="fromm"/&gt;  Later reports reiterated the need for more exposure to engineering's context as well as a need to make engineering more attractive and relevant to students.&lt;ref&gt;Engineering Deans Council and Corporate Roundtable of the American Society for Engineering Education, ''The Green Report: Engineering Education for a Changing World,'' [[American Society for Engineering Education]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Papers also reported the need for engineering students to develop professional and interpersonal skills.&lt;ref&gt;T.W. Hissey, ''Education and Careers 2000,'' Proceedings of the [[IEEE]], vol. 88, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering education today==

Today, requirements for engineering programs reflect a movement to resolve the engineering education problems found in past studies.  Many engineering educators see service-learning as a way to enhance their programs by exposing students to engineering context while also giving them a chance to develop professional and interpersonal skills.  These values are reflected in the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET) standards for engineering schools.  For an engineering program to maintain accreditation, ABET requires that they "demonstrate that their students attain the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context".&lt;ref&gt;ABET, ''Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs,'' The Engineering Accreditation Commission of the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]]., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pedagogical implications===

;Constructivism

The service-learning method ties in well with a teaching philosophy known as [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]].  Constructivism is an educational theory rooted in psychology and sociology.&lt;ref name="mariappan"&gt;J. Mariappan, S. Monemi and U. Fan, ''Enhancing Authentic Learning Experiences through Community-based Engineering Service-Learning'', 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-ari"&gt;M. Ben-Ari, ''Constructivism in Computer Science Education,'' SIGCSE, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  It asserts that learners construct knowledge from previous knowledge rather than passively absorbing knowledge from outside sources.&lt;ref name="mariappan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ben-ari" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. P. Smith III, A. A. diSessa and J. Roschelle, ''Misconceptions Reconceived: A Constructivist Analysis of Knowledge in Transition,'' Journal of the Learning Sciences, vol. 3, pp. 115–163, 1993–1994&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, learning includes both creation of new factual knowledge and understanding the connections between different nodes of knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Bransford and B. S. Stein, ''The IDEAL Problem Solver'', [[New York City]], Bice-Heath, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  Service-learning provides an environment where students can actively construct knowledge while engaging in actual projects.  The reflection portion of service-learning gives students time to create connections between old and new knowledge.  

While accepted by many, some educators have criticized constructivism both [[epistemological]]ly and pedagogically.  Pedagogically, critics claim that a constructivist approach gives students in-depth knowledge but not breadth of knowledge.  Since in a constructivist approach takes a significant amount of time to allow students to create new knowledge and relate it to previous knowledge through reflection, instructors usually cannot cover a large amount of material.&lt;ref&gt;R. K. Coll and T. G. N. Taylor, ''Using Constructivism to Inform, Tertiary Chemistry Pedagogy,'' Chemistry Education: Research and Practice in Europe, vol. 2, pp. 215–226, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, while this may become a real concern for many courses, the specific role of service-learning plays in engineering school courses mitigates these concerns.  Service-learning typically appears in introductory or optional courses in the engineering school.  The goals of these courses is not so much to gain a detailed and broad understand of a field, but rather to have a real world engineering experience.  This is notably different from courses where students must obtain vast amounts of accurate knowledge for precise calculations.

Critics also worry that a constructivist approach to education leaves the learner too disconnected from reality since it constantly focuses on building new knowledge based on pre-existing knowledge.  Thus, theoretically, as they continue building knowledge off of their pre-existing knowledge in isolation, their view of the world could slowly become skewed from reality.&lt;ref name="olssen"&gt;M. Olssen, ''Radical Constructivism and Its Failing: Anti-Realism and Individualism,'' British Journal of Educational Studies, vol. 44, pp. 275–295, Sept., 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  While this may be a weakness for many courses, in service-learning, students work to create real solutions for a real customer.  Thus their ideas must be resolved, not only with fellow engineering team members, but also with reality.  

;Learning styles

In past years, studies on engineering education revealed the [[learning styles]] of most engineering students and the teaching styles of many engineering professors were incompatible.   The five well known learning style dimensions include: sensing/intuitive, visual/auditory, inductive/deductive, active/reflective, and global/sequential.  

According to Richard Felder from North Carolina State University and Linda Silverman from the Institute for the study of Advanced Development, most engineering students are visual, sensing, inductive, and active learners.  Also, many of the creative students are global learners.  However, most engineering education is auditory, intuitive, deductive, passive and sequential.&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Felder and L. K. Silverman, ''Learning and Teaching Styles In Engineering Education,'' Engr. Education, vol. 78, pp. 674–681, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, such conclusions are not well-supported by research.  There is no evidence that identifying a student's learning style produces better outcomes, and there is significant evidence that the widespread "meshing hypothesis" (that a student will learn best if taught in a method deemed appropriate for the student's learning style) is invalid.&lt;ref name="pashler"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pashler | first1 = H. | last2 = McDaniel | first2 = M. | last3 = Rohrer | first3 = D. | last4 = Bjork | first4 = R. | year = 2008 | title = Learning styles: Concepts and evidence | url = | journal = Psychological Science in the Public Interest | volume = 9 | issue = 3| pages = 105–119 | doi=10.1111/j.1539-6053.2009.01038.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Well-designed studies "flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis".&lt;ref name=pashler /&gt;

;Online service learning

Though the interest in service learning at educational institutions has increased, these projects are often very costly to students and universities.  However, there have been some examples of successful service learning projects facilitated over the Internet.

===Engineering programs with service-learning===

Many different universities have incorporated service-learning into their curricula to address the contextual, motivational, and multi-disciplinary team needs.  Purdue University created the Engineering Projects in Community Service (EPICS) program in 1995.  Under this program, freshman to senior undergraduate engineering students form multi-disciplinary teams to meet community needs.  Students earn a variable number of credit hours based on their year in school and related contribution to the project.  At Purdue, the service projects are long-term and students earn up to seven semesters worth of credit working on the service project.  The program began with 40 students on 5 teams but has quickly grown to 400 students on 24 teams.&lt;ref name="olssen" /&gt;

The EPICS program at Purdue as well as service-learning programs at other universities, have succeeded in offering students practical experience, context, and motivation for engineering.  Seventy seven percent of the students who were able to come back to the EPICS program stayed for additional semesters.  On student evaluations, 70% of students indicated that the program positively impacted their decision to stay in engineering; of the 30% that responded differently, several indicated they had previously decided to stay in the engineering before the program and thus, the program did not affect their decision to stay in engineering.  Student responses also returned favorable results for the educational objectives.  The table below summarizes the responses:

On evaluation comments, students also expressed that EPICS had completely changed their view of engineering, giving them both meaning and direction in all of their engineering studies.&lt;ref name="olssen" /&gt;

Penn State University has created a certificate program entitled 'Humanitarian Engineering'.  The emphasis of the program is on relationship building – and are not simply project-driven exercises.  Long-term, sustainable, [[collaborative partnerships]] are formed with host universities and marginalized communities.  This enables development of outreach programs at the universities reaching into local communities.  The Penn State program is vertically integrated across the four-year engineering program allowing students to form these long-term relationships with the host communities.  This method allows for greater understanding of the cultural aspects of engineering design and its impact, as well as development of technical proficiency.  There is also a very strong emphasis on entrepreneurship in the program.  Engineering design solutions are developed and students are encouraged to develop business plans and implement them in the host community.\

[[Clemson University]] also hosts Clemson Engineers for Developing Countries (CEDC), a multi-level immersive student-led organization and class that provides Clemson students of any major with service-learning and project experience. The focus of the program is to provide sustainable solutions aimed at improving the quality of life for those living in the emerging world while using students for all design, planning, and project implementation. CEDC has a student-led corporate organizational structure, including vertical integration from freshmen to graduate students and horizontal integration from over 30 majors, and works on between 15 and 20 projects per semester.  The program also features multidisciplinary teams of 2–4 student interns who live in [[Haiti]] year- round, fall and spring break trips to Haiti for groups of 10–14 students to collect data for their projects, and a course at Clemson University for students to work on their multi-semester projects. The program has designed and managed over $2 million in construction projects in Haiti, all with direct oversight and management from the CEDC interns who are housed by [[Partners in Health]]. To date, CEDC students have implemented projects all over Haiti's rural Central Plateau (including several in [[Cange]]), which include several water systems, a fish hatchery, a [[biodigester]] system, and repairing public schools. 

==Social and ethical implications==

The [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] Code of Ethics lists contributing to society and human well-being as well as improving public understanding of an engineer's practice area.  Through service-learning provides engineers with the opportunity to both contribute to society and educate the public. 

Along with fostering a good community-university relationship, educators hope incorporating service-learning will increase diversity and retention in the engineering school.  Diversifying the engineering population will allow engineering teams to maintain a better understanding of the needs in a society.  So diversifying engineering teams will allow engineers to both meet real needs as well as provide interfaces to their solutions which the public can understand.  Likewise, a society needs a vast population of engineers to meet the needs of a vast society.

'''SkELL''' is an abbreviation of [[Sketch Engine]] for Language Learning.&lt;ref name="raslan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baisa|first1=Vít|last2=Suchomel|first2=Vít|title=SkELL:Web Interface for English Language Learning|journal=Eighth Workshop on Recent Advances in Slavonic Natural Language Processing|date=2014|pages=63–70|url=https://nlp.fi.muni.cz/raslan/raslan14.pdf#page=71|publisher=NLP Consulting}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a web interface for language learning. The main purpose is to help students and teachers of languages. SkELL has its own [[Text corpus|corpus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://eflnotes.wordpress.com/tag/james-thomas/ |title=Discovering English with SketchEngine – James Thomas interview |last=Thomas |first=James |publisher= |date=14 June 2015 |website=EFL NOTES |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was gathered so that contained texts covering everyday, standard, formal, and professional language.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt; In the corpus, there are a total of more than 60 million sentences and more than one billion words.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/skell/ |title=SkELL |publisher=Lexical Computing Ltd. |date= |website=Sketch Engine |access-date=21 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SkELL interface provides features such as simple search showing words in context, but the maximum of displayed lines ([[Concordance (publishing)|concordances]], in fact) is 40. However, the frequency of searched query is located below the search box and expressed with the number ''hits per million''. The second function is [[word sketch]] which enables showing collocates for a given word or words. The last one is named as similar words. It visualises similar words to searched word in a [[word cloud]].

The tool has been available also for the Russian language (since 2015)&lt;ref&gt;Valentina, A., Vitalevna, B. O., Малолетняя, А. П., Olga, K., &amp; Vit, B. (2016).

== Features ==
SkELL offers three types of searches.

* Examples – searching for words and phrases and their all derived forms
* Word sketch – a simplified version of the original word sketch page
* Similar words – based on the Distributional [[thesaurus]] in Sketch Engine, there are not necessarily	synonyms



== Data ==
The corpus for English SkELL consists of [[English Wikipedia]] (special sorted out 130,000 articles), English collection of [[Project Gutenberg]], a subset from the web corpus enTenTen14,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jakubíček|first1=Miloš.|last2=Kilgarriff|first2=Adam|last3=Kovář|first3=Vojtěch|last4=Rychlý|first4=Pavel|last5=Suchomel|first5=Vít|title=The tenten corpus family|journal=Seventh International Corpus Linguistics Conference CL|date=July 2013|pages=125–127|url=|publisher=Lancaster University}}&lt;/ref&gt; the whole [[British National Corpus]], and free new sources.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

=== Processing the data ===
After gathering and pre-cleaning (all structures have removed except sentences) data has run through processing pipe: normalization, [[Tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]], TreeTagger for English, and [[Data deduplication|deduplication]]. The further process was a compilation of the corpus using manatee indexing library. In the end, all sentences were scored with the GDEX&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kilgarriff|first1=A.|last2=Husák|first2=M.|last3=McAdam|first3=K.|last4=Rundell|first4=M.|last5=Rychlý|first5=P.|title=GDEX: Automatically finding good dictionary examples in a corpus|journal=Proceedings of the XIII EURALEX International Congress|date=July 2008|pages=425–432|url=http://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5040252|publisher=EURALEX}}&lt;/ref&gt; tool.&lt;ref name="raslan"/&gt;

'''Superposed order''' (also superimposed)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superimposed orders|url=http://en.mimi.hu/architecture/superimposed_orders.html|publisher=en.mimi.hu|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one where successive storeys of a building have different orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Superposed order|url=https://global.britannica.com/technology/superposed-order|website=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|publisher=global.britannica.com|accessdate=29 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous ancient example of such an order is [[the Colosseum]] at Rome, which had no less than four storeys of superposed orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chitham|first1=Robert|title=The Classical Orders of Architecture|date=May 12, 2014|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9781483278230|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The superposition rules were  developed in ancient Greece and were also actively used in the architecture of ancient Rome. Later in the 19th century, the order was used in the architecture of the Renaissance and [[Baroque]].

==Composition==
The heaviest orders are at the bottom of a building, whilst the lightest come at the top. This rule means that the [[Doric order]] is a preferred order for the ground floor, the [[Ionic order]] is used for the middle storey, while the [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] or the [[Composite order]] is used for the top storey. The ground floor may also have [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. Initially, the top story usually featured the Composite order, but, after [[Vincenzo Scamozzi]] published his treatise ''L’Idea dell’Architettura Universale'' (''The Idea of a Universal Architecture'') (Venice, 1615), architects switched to the Corinthian order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=СУПЕРПОЗИЦИЯ|url=http://www.rah.ru/science/glossary/detail.php?ID=19529&amp;sphrase_id=26073|website=[[The Russian Academy of Arts ]]|publisher=rah.ru|accessdate=29 August 2016|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superposed order allowed storeys without columns, but rearrangement of order styles was strictly forbidden.

'''Christian Matthias Theodor Mommsen''' (30 November 1817 &amp;ndash; 1 November 1903) was a German [[classics|classical scholar]], [[historian]], [[jurist]], [[journalist]], [[politician]] and [[archaeologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nndb.com/people/618/000107297/|title=Theodor Mommsen|author=|date=|website=www.nndb.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the greatest [[classicists]] of the 19th century. His work regarding [[Roman history]] is still of fundamental importance for contemporary research. He received the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1902 for being "the greatest living master of the art of historical writing, with special reference to his monumental work, ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|A History of Rome]]''", after having been nominated by 18 members of the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/literature/laureates/1902/index.html|title=The Nobel Prize in Literature 1902|author=|date=|website=nobelprize.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nomination/archive/show.php?id=8100|title=Nomination Database|author=|date=|website=www.nobelprize.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a prominent German politician, as a member of the Prussian and German parliaments. His works on [[Roman law]] and on the [[law of obligations]] had a significant impact on the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|German civil code]].

== Life ==
Mommsen was born to German parents in [[Garding]] in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]] in 1817, then ruled by the king of Denmark, and grew up in [[Bad Oldesloe]] in [[Holstein]], where his father was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister. He studied mostly at home, though he attended the [[gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] [[Christianeum Hamburg|Christianeum]] in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]] for four years. He studied [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] and received his diploma in 1837. As he could not afford to study at [[Göttingen]], he enrolled at the [[University of Kiel]].

Mommsen studied [[jurisprudence]] at Kiel from 1838 to 1843, finishing his studies with the degree of Doctor of Roman Law. During this time he was the roommate of [[Theodor Storm]], who was later to become a renowned poet. Together with Mommsen's brother Tycho, the three friends even published a collection of poems (''Liederbuch dreier Freunde''). Thanks to a royal Danish grant, Mommsen was able to visit France and Italy to study preserved classical Roman inscriptions. During the [[revolution of 1848]] he worked as a war correspondent in then-Danish [[Rendsburg]], supporting the German [[Schleswig-Holstein#History|annexation of Schleswig-Holstein]] and a constitutional reform. Having been forced to leave the country by the Danes, he became a professor of [[law]] in the same year at the [[University of Leipzig]]. When Mommsen protested against the new constitution of [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]] in 1851, he had to resign. However, the next year he obtained a professorship in Roman law at the [[University of Zurich]] and then spent a couple of years in exile. In 1854 he became a professor of law at the [[University of Breslau]] where he met [[Jakob Bernays]]. Mommsen became a research professor at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy of Sciences]] in 1857. He later helped to create and manage the German Archaeological Institute in Rome.

In 1858 Mommsen was appointed a member of the Academy of Sciences in Berlin, and he also became professor of Roman History at the [[University of Berlin]] in 1861, where he held lectures up to 1887. Mommsen received high recognition for his academic achievements: foreign membership of the [[Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1859,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.dwc.knaw.nl/biografie/pmknaw/?pagetype=authorDetail&amp;aId=PE00001937 |title=Th. Mommsen (1817 - 1903) |publisher=Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences |date= |accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; the medal [[Pour le Mérite]] in 1868, honorary citizenship of Rome, elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1870,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistm|title=MemberListM|author=|date=|website=americanantiquarian.org|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nobel prize for literature]] in 1902 for his main work ''Römische Geschichte'' (''Roman History''). (He is one of the very few [[non-fiction]] writers to receive the Nobel prize in literature.)&lt;ref&gt;Until 2007, when [[Doris Lessing]] won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Literature Prize]], Mommsen was the oldest person to receive the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mommsen was an indefatigable worker who rose at five to do research in his library. People often saw him reading whilst walking in the streets.&lt;ref&gt;"Apart from any actual learning, the deepest impression that I carried away from my first ''Semester'' in Berlin was a sense of the pervading enthusiasm for ''Wissenschaft''. I was also astonished at the high standard of industry both among the Seniors and the Juniors whom I mixed up with. And I could not help feeling that our steadiest workers among my Oxford undergraduate friends were only casual 'half-timers' by comparison. What was still more stimulating was the whole-hearted and unquestioning reverence for learning broadcast through the academic circles and extending even to the outside public. I had a striking proof of this: as an illustration of national character, the anecdote is worth recording. Living in Berlin at some distance from the university, I used to go in every morning by the same early tram: and at last noting that I was a foreigner of regular habits, the affable and chatty tramway conductor used to point out to me the objects worthy of interest by the way (''Sehenswürdigkeiten''—a crisp Teutonic word). One morning as we approached a halting-place, I saw a little old gentleman with silvery hair leaning against a lamp-post and holding a large open volume near to his short-sighted eyes, oblivious of the uproar around: the conductor sprang down towards him, and tapping him reverentially on the shoulder conducted him gently to the tram and settled him in his place. Immediately the old gentleman buried himself again up to the eyes in his tome. The conductor, proud of this new ''Sehenswürdigkeit'', whispered to me in an awed voice: '' 'Da ist der berühmte Herr Professor Mommsen; er verliert kein Moment'!'' ('There is the famous Professor Mr Mommsen; he never loses a moment!' referring to his absorption in his book). I felt thrilled, not by Mommsen, but by this deep revelation of the national soul, an illiterate conductor knowing of Mommsen at all, knowing that he was academically famous, being proud of having him in his tram, and proud that he 'never lost a moment' for study." — Farnell, Lewis R. (1934). ''An Oxonian Looks Back.'' London: Martin Hopkinson, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mommsen had sixteen children with his wife Marie (daughter of the publisher and editor Karl Reimer of Leipzig). Their oldest daughter Maria married [[Ulrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff]], the great Classics scholar. Their grandson [[Theodor Ernst Mommsen]] (1905-1958) became a professor of medieval history in the United States. Two of the great-grandsons, [[Hans Mommsen]] and [[Wolfgang Mommsen]], were prominent German historians.

[[File:Theodor Mommsen 02.jpg|thumb|Theodor Mommsen in 1863]]

Mommsen published over 1,500 works, and effectively established a new framework for the systematic study of [[Rome|Roman]] history. He pioneered [[epigraphy]], the study of [[inscription]]s in material artifacts. Although the unfinished ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', written early in his career, has long been widely considered as his main work, the work most relevant today is perhaps the ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', a collection of Roman inscriptions he contributed to the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |title=Theodor Mommsen |website=Books and Writers ''(kirjasto.sci.fi)'' |first=Petri |last=Liukkonen |publisher=[[Kuusankoski]] Public Library |location=Finland |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140824083420/http://www.kirjasto.sci.fi/mommsen.htm |archivedate=24 August 2014 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Mommsen's ''History of Rome'']], his most famous work, appeared as three volumes in 1854, 1855, and 1856; it expounded Roman history up to the end of the [[Roman republic]] and the rule of [[Julius Caesar]]. Since Mommsen admired Caesar, he felt unable to describe the death of his hero. He closely compared the political thought and terminology of the ancient Republic, especially during its last century, with the situation of his own time, e.g., the [[nation-state]], [[democracy]] and incipient [[imperialism]]. It is one of the great classics of historical works. Mommsen never wrote a promised next volume to recount subsequent events during the [[Roman Empire|imperial period]], i.e., a volume 4, although demand was high for a continuation.&lt;ref&gt;Notes taken between 1882 and 1886 of his lectures on the Roman Empire were discovered nearly a century later and in 1992 were published under the title ''A History of Rome Under the Emperors''.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately very popular and acknowledged internationally by classical scholars, the work also quickly received criticism.&lt;ref&gt;His terse style was called journalistic. His transparent comparison of ancient to modern politics was said to distort. In 1931 [[Egon Friedell]] summed it up, that in his hands "[[Crassus]] becomes a [[speculator]] in the manner of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]], the brothers [[Gracchus]] are [[Socialist]] leaders, and the [[Gallia|Gauls]] are [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indians]], etc." Friedell, Kulturgeschichte der Neuzeit, v3 p270. Cf., [[History of Rome (Mommsen)|Mommsen's ''History of Rome'']].&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''The Provinces of the Roman Empire from Caesar to Diocletian'' (1885), published as volume 5 of his ''[[History of Rome (Mommsen)|History of Rome]]'', is a description of all Roman regions during the early imperial period.
* ''Roman Chronology to the Time of Caesar'' (1858) written with his brother [[August Mommsen]].
* ''Roman Constitutional Law'' (1871–1888). This systematic treatment of [[Roman Law|Roman constitutional law]] in three volumes has been of importance for research on ancient history.
[[File:Theodor Mommsen by Ludwig Knaus (1881).jpg|thumb|Theodor Mommsen in 1881]]
* ''Roman Criminal Law'' (1899)
* ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'', lead editor and editor (1861, et seq.)
* ''[[Digest (Roman law)|Digesta]]'' (of [[Justinian I|Justinian]]), editor (1866–1870, two volumes)
* ''Iordanis Romana et Getica'' (1882) was Mommsen's critical edition of [[Jordanes]]' ''The Origin and Deeds of the Goths'' and has subsequently come to be generally known simply as ''[[Getica]]''.
* ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]'', editor (1905, posthumous)
* ''Monumentum Ancyranum''
* More than 1,500 further studies and treatises on single issues.

A bibliography of over 1,000 of his works is given by [[Karl Zangemeister|Zangemeister]] in ''Mommsen als Schriftsteller'' (1887; continued by Jacobs, 1905).

== Mommsen as editor and organiser ==
While he was secretary of the Historical-Philological Class at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Berlin Academy]] (1874–1895), Mommsen organised countless scientific projects, mostly editions of original sources.

=== ''Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum'' ===
At the beginning of his career, when he published the inscriptions of the [[Naples|Neapolitan]] Kingdom (1852), Mommsen already had in mind a collection of all known ancient Latin inscriptions. He received additional impetus and training from [[Bartolomeo Borghesi]] of [[San Marino]]. The complete ''[[Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum]]'' would consist of sixteen volumes. Fifteen of them appeared in Mommsen's lifetime and he wrote five of them himself. The basic principle of the edition (contrary to previous collections) was the method of autopsy, according to which all copies (i.e., modern transcriptions) of inscriptions were to be checked and compared to the original.

=== Further editions and research projects ===
Mommsen published the fundamental collections in Roman law: the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' and the ''[[Codex Theodosianus]]''. Furthermore, he played an important role in the publication of the ''[[Monumenta Germaniae Historica]]'', the edition of the texts of the [[Church Fathers]], the [[Limes|Limes Romanus]] (Roman frontiers) research and countless other projects.

== Mommsen as politician ==
Mommsen was a delegate to the [[Prussian House of Representatives]] from 1863&amp;ndash;66 and again from 1873&amp;ndash;79, and delegate to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] from 1881–1884, at first for the liberal [[German Progress Party]] (''Deutsche Fortschrittspartei''), later for the [[National Liberal Party (Germany)|National Liberal Party]], and finally for the [[Liberal Union (Germany)|Secessionists]]. He was very concerned with questions about academic and educational policies and held national positions. Although he had supported [[German Unification]], he was disappointed with the politics of the [[German Empire]] and he was quite pessimistic about its future. Mommsen strongly disagreed with [[Otto von Bismarck]] about social policies in 1881, advising collaboration between Liberals and Social Democrats and using such strong language that he narrowly avoided prosecution.

[[File:Theodor Mommsen outdoors.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Mommsen late in his career]]

As a Liberal nationalist, Mommsen favored assimilation of ethnic minorities into German society, not exclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Ziblatt|title=Structuring the State: The Formation of Italy and Germany and the Puzzle of Federalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1dlob9r5TH0C&amp;pg=PA54|year=2008|publisher=Princeton U.P.|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879, his colleague [[Heinrich von Treitschke]] began a political campaign against Jews (the so-called ''Berliner Antisemitismusstreit''). Mommsen strongly opposed [[antisemitism]] and wrote a harsh pamphlet in which he denounced von Treitschke's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0014_0_14106.html|title=Mommsen, Theodor|last=Graetz|first=Michael J.|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=23 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mommsen viewed a solution to antisemitism in voluntary [[cultural assimilation]], suggesting that the Jews could follow the example of the people of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Hannover|Hanover]] and other German states, which gave up some of their special customs when integrating in [[Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9906E1D61630EE3ABC4053DFB766838A699FDE "Prof. Mommsen and the Jews"], from ''[[The Times]]'', reprinted in ''[[The New York Times]]'', 8 January 1881.&lt;/ref&gt;
Mommsen was a vehement spokesman for German nationalism, maintaining a militant attitude towards the [[Slavic peoples|Slavic nations]], to the point of advocating the use of violence against them. In an 1897 letter to the ''[[Neue Freie Presse]]'' of [[Vienna]], Mommsen called [[Czechs]] "apostles of barbarism" and wrote that "the Czech skull is impervious to reason, but it is susceptible to blows".&lt;ref&gt;http://media.hoover.org/documents/0817944915_146.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--What publication is this from?--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://anno.onb.ac.at/cgi-content/anno?apm=0&amp;aid=nfp&amp;datum=18971031&amp;seite=1&amp;zoom=2 |title=An die Deutschen in Oesterreich |publisher=Neue Freie Presse - issue 11923 |date=31 October 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence of Mommsen ==

[[File:Theodor Mommsen by Franz von Lenbach 1897.jpg|thumb|Mommsen by Franz von Lenbach, 1897.]]

Fellow Nobel Laureate (1925) [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] cited Mommsen's interpretation of the last First Consul of the Republic, Julius Caesar, as one of the inspirations for his 1898 (1905 on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]) play, ''[[Caesar and Cleopatra (play)|Caesar and Cleopatra]]''.

Noted naval historian and theorist [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] formulated the thesis for his magnum opus, ''[[The Influence of Sea Power Upon History]]'', while reading Mommsen's ''History of Rome''.&lt;ref&gt;Mahan, Alfred Thayer. ''From Sail to Stream: Recollections of Naval Life''. New York: Harper and Brothers Publishers, 1907: 277&lt;/ref&gt;

The playwright [[Heiner Müller]] wrote a 'performance text' entitled ''Mommsens Block'' (1993), inspired by the publication of Mommsen's fragmentary notes on the later Roman empire and by the [[East German]] government's decision to replace a statue of [[Karl Marx]] outside the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] with one of Mommsen.&lt;ref&gt;Heiner Müller, ''[[Mommsen's Block]]''. In ''A Heiner Müller Reader: Plays | Poetry | Prose''. Ed. and trans. [[Carl Weber (theatre director)|Carl Weber]]. PAJ Books Ser. Baltimore and London: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001. {{ISBN|0-8018-6578-6}}. p.122-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] (academic high school) named for Mommsen in his hometown of [[Bad Oldesloe]], Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. His birthplace [[Garding]] in the west of Schleswig styles itself "Mommsen-Stadt Garding".

===Mark Twain===

"One of the highpoints of [[Mark Twain]]'s European tour of 1892 was a large formal banquet at the [[University of Berlin]]... . Mark Twain was an honored guest, seated at the head table with some twenty 'particularly eminent professors'; and it was from this vantage point that he witnessed the following incident... ."&lt;ref&gt;Saunder and Collins, "Introduction" to their edition of Mommsen's ''History of Rome'' (Meridian Books 1958), at 1-17, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In Twain's own words:   
    
&lt;blockquote&gt;When apparently the last eminent guest had long ago taken his place, again those three bugle-blasts rang out, and once more the swords leaped from their scabbards. Who might this late comer be? Nobody was interested to inquire. Still, indolent eyes were turned toward the distant entrance, and we saw the silken gleam and the lifted sword of a guard of honor plowing through the remote crowds. Then we saw that end of the house rising to its feet; saw it rise abreast the advancing guard all along like a wave. This supreme honor had been offered to no one before. There was an excited whisper at our table—'MOMMSEN!'—and the whole house rose. Rose and shouted and stamped and clapped and banged the beer mugs. Just simply a storm!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Then the little man with his long hair and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emersonian]] face edged his way past us and took his seat. I could have touched him with my hand—Mommsen!—think of it! ... I would have walked a great many miles to get a sight of him, and here he was, without trouble or tramp or cost of any kind. Here he was clothed in a titanic deceptive modesty which made him look like other men.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Saunders and Collins, ''supra''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''WorldFish''' is an international, nonprofit research organization with [[headquarters]] in [[Penang]], [[Malaysia]], and offices in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and the Pacific. WorldFish’s mission is to harness the potential of fisheries and aquaculture to reduce [[poverty]] and [[hunger]] in developing countries.&lt;ref name="thetechawards"&gt;[http://thetechawards.thetech.org/the-laureates/worldfish-center WorldFish Center mission], The Tech Awards article.&lt;/ref&gt;

WorldFish is a member of the [[CGIAR|Consortium of International Agricultural Research Centers (CGIAR)]], a global agriculture research partnership for a food secure future.&lt;ref name="IDS"&gt;[https://www.ids.ac.uk/organisation/worldfish-center WorldFish Center as part of CGIAR], Institute of Development Studies, WorldFish Center article.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Working in partnership with private and public sectors and civil society, WorldFish uses its scientific expertise in fisheries and [[aquaculture]] to promote sustainable, evidence-based development solutions and policy recommendations that support the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="UNMDGs"&gt;[http://www.worldfishcenter.org/sites/default/files/WF_903_0.pdf How WorldFish supports U.N. Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)], worldfishcenter.org online pamphlet.&lt;/ref&gt; All services and solutions developed by the Center are international public goods that are made freely available to all.&lt;ref name="publicGoods"&gt;[http://www.cgiar.org/www-archive/www.cgiar.org/pdf/ir_sagasti_timmer.pdf CGIAR as a Provider of International Public Goods], cgiar.org pdf document&lt;/ref&gt;
 
WorldFish has introduced innovative technologies and practices that are brought to scale through a network of partners. The Center works on a breeding program to develop the Abbassa strain of Nile Tilapia that helped increase aquaculture productivity and improve food security for millions of Egyptians.&lt;ref name="abbassaStrain"&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/global/r-d/news/fast-growing-fish-variety-could-benefit-egypt-and-west-africa-.html Abbassa strain of Nile Tilapia], SciDevNet article.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Bangladesh]], WorldFish trained and supported thousands of rural farmers by helping them improve the productivity of their homestead ponds and gardens.

WorldFish has been recognized with a [[The Tech Awards|Tech Museum Award]]&lt;ref name="techMuseumAward"&gt;[http://news.bio-medicine.org/biology-news-3/Worldfish-Center-honored-as-2005-Tech-Museum-Awards-Laureate-10004-1/ Tech Museum Award], Bio-Medicine, Biology Research Tools article.&lt;/ref&gt; and several [[World Bank Development Marketplace Award]]s.&lt;ref name="multipleAwards"&gt;[http://www.cgiar.org/web-archives/www-cgiar-org-monthlystory-june2005-html/ World Bank Global Development Marketplace awards], cgiar.org article.&lt;/ref&gt;

WorldFish is committed to meeting two key development challenges: 1) Improving the livelihoods of those who are poor and vulnerable in places where fisheries and aquaculture can make a difference and 2) achieving large scale, environmentally sustainable, increases in supply and access to fish at affordable prices for poor consumers in developing countries.&lt;ref name="welcomeWF"&gt;[http://www.worldfishcenter.org/welcome-worldfish#.U647GF4SgpE Welcome to WorldFish], Article, worldfishcenter.org&lt;/ref&gt;

To meet these challenges WorldFish focuses its expertise and research in the following areas: 
* Building adaptive capacity to climate change in fisheries and aquaculture
* Strengthening gender equality in fish-dependent communities 
* Increasing the benefits to poor people from fisheries and aquaculture value-chains
* Improving nutrition and health through fisheries and aquaculture
* Identifying and promoting policies and practices to increase the resilience of small-scale fisheries
* Sustainably increasing the productivity of small-scale aquaculture

WorldFish is one of the 15 specialized research centers of the Consortium on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR),&lt;ref name="SEAT"&gt;[http://seatglobal.eu/partners/international/the-worldfish-center/ SEAT Article], seatglobal.eu&lt;/ref&gt; and is also an implementing partner for the CGIAR Research Program on Aquatic Agricultural Systems (AAS).&lt;ref name="AAS Zambia"&gt;[http://www.thefishsite.com/fishnews/21455/sustainably-managing-natural-resources-in-zambia AAS Zambia], thefishsite.com, Article&lt;/ref&gt; This research program aims to reduce poverty and improve food security for people whose livelihoods depend on aquatic agricultural systems.&lt;ref name="AAS food security"&gt;[http://aas.cgiar.org/program/about-program#.U64_rI2Syf9 AAS food security], aas.cgiar.org, Article&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact and Innovation==
WorldFish, with its partners, has raised incomes for millions of poor people by integrating aquaculture with agriculture and has empowered poor communities to participate in the sustainable co-management of their fisheries. At its core, WorldFish is a scientific research organization. The center works with an extensive network of donors and partners to create positive change for the millions who depend on fish in the developing world. It has helped countries cope with disaster and conflict by restoring fisheries, providing nations with tools to improve the planning and management of major river basins and strengthening national capacities for fisheries management.

Three areas of work have generated particularly large impact:

* The breeding of much higher-yielding Tilapia fish varieties, widely used in aquaculture across Asia, greatly raised productivity and incomes of poor small-scale farmers: $170 returned for each $100 invested per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50094/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304053510/http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/Project/50094/ |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}, Research For Development&lt;/ref&gt;
* The strengthening Aquatic Resource Governance  (STARGO) project helped lake communities in Zambia, Cambodia and Uganda build lake capacity to manage conflicts over fish resources and lay a foundation for sustainable management of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coresilience.org/], Coresilience.org&lt;/ref&gt;
* In Egypt, WorldFish used selective breeding approaches to develop the 'Abbassa Strain', which grows up to 28% faster than the most commonly used commercial breed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scidev.net/global/r-d/news/fast-growing-fish-variety-could-benefit-egypt-and-west-africa-.html?stay=full], Sci Dev Net&lt;/ref&gt;  The Improving Employment and Income through the Development of Egypt's Aquaculture Sector (IEIDEAS) project supplied 50 fish farms and 130 hatcheries with the fast-growing strain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infofish.org/pdf/GSH/GH1_2014.pdf], Globe Fish Highlights&lt;/ref&gt; IEIDEAS is strengthening the Egyptian aquaculture industry by providing training and by generating employment for people who depend on the sector.

==Milestones==

The following information provides major milestones in the development and operation of the WorldFish Center, from the conceptual phase to the present, highlighting organizational changes and developments, such as the formal establishment of the Center, the establishment and closure of sites outside the headquarters, Board Chair and Directors General, and milestones which led to the entrance of the Center into the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research. Some of this material is taken from '[https://www.worldfishcenter.org/content/lasting-catch A Lasting Catch]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.worldfishcenter.org/content/lasting-catch|title=A Lasting Catch|last=Schioler|first=E.|date=2002|website=WorldFish|publisher=WorldFish Center|page=147 pp|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.'

''1973-1974 Conceptual phase'':

* The Rockefeller Foundation convenes a conference in October 1973, to review worldwide and regional needs in aquaculture and fisheries.
* '[http://pubs.iclarm.net/resource_centre/WF-44.pdf A Proposal for the Creation of an International Center for Living Aquatic Resources Management (ICLARM])' is published in 1974. This working document was prepared by Dr John Pino, Rockefeller Foundation.

''1975-1976 Exploratory phase:''

* Rockefeller Foundation Program, hosted by the University of Hawaii, commences in early 1975.
* Dr Philip Helfrich (USA) of the Hawaii Institute of Marine Biology, University of Hawaii, accepts the post of Center Director ( January 1975-November 1976).
* Staff and consultants fly 650,000 km, visiting 500 individuals and 43 national agencies in 47 countries, developing long-range programs and selecting a suitable headquarters location.
* Research programs are set up with the following thrusts: Aquaculture, Traditional Fisheries, Resource Development and Management, Marine Affairs, and Education and Training.
* The Center produces its first publication in 1975.

''1977 Establishment phase:''

* On 20 January 1977 'ICLARM' becomes an independent institution. Two months later the headquarters moved to Manila in the Philippines.
* The first Director General, Dr John C. Marr (USA), is appointed (November 1976-March 1979).
* Dr James E. Johnston (USA) is appointed first Board Chair (1977-1983)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6013">The '''Zendian problem''' was an exercise in communication intelligence operations (mainly [[traffic analysis]] and [[cryptanalysis]]) devised by [[Lambros D. Callimahos]] as part of an advanced course, CA-400, that Callimahos taught to [[National Security Agency]] [[cryptanalysts]] starting in the 1950s.

==Content==
The scenario involves 375 radio messages said to have been intercepted on December 23 by the [[United States Army|US Army]] contingent of a [[United Nations]] force landed on the fictional island of Zendia in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

A typical intercept looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
XYR DE OWN 4235KCS 230620T USM-99/00091

9516 8123 0605 7932 8423 5095 8444 6831

SREEE USSDS DHOAH REEXI PROUT   NTTHD JAAAJ EUEBD
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

For each message, the first line is provided by the [[SIGINT|intercept]] operator, giving [[call sign]]s, [[frequency]], time, and reference number.  The rest of the message is a transcript of the [[Morse code]] transmission.

At the beginning of the intercepted message there is a header which consists of 8 four-digit groups. Initially, the meaning of the numeric header is not known; the meanings of various components of this header (such as a [[serial number]] assigned by the transmitting organization's message center) can be worked out through traffic analysis.

The rest of the message consists of "indicators" and [[encryption|ciphertext]]; the first group is evidently a "discriminant" indicating the cryptosystem used, and (depending on the cryptosystem) some or all of the second group may contain a message-specific [[key (cryptography)|keying]] element such as initial [[rotor machine|rotor]] settings.  The first two groups are repeated at the end of the message, which allows correction of garbled indicators.  The remaining characters are encrypted text.  Since the transmissions always use complete groups, "nulls" may have been used to [[Padding (cryptography)#Classical cryptography|pad out]] the text.

Cryptosystems employed include [[transposition cipher|transposition]], dinome, and [[Rotor machine|rotor]]-based [[cipher]]s and a [[one-part code]].  While these can be successfully tackled without use of a computer, solution is not easy.  The practical exercise reinforces many basic principles, including ways to exploit having a ''collection'' of message traffic.

A certain amount of [[cleartext]] inter-operator "chatter" is also provided, and may help with the analysis.

Headers and discriminants are also given for intercepts from the next three days; these may be used for traffic analysis and in determining daily operating procedures.

==Availability==
The Zendian problem has been [[classified information|declassified]] and is available either as part of ''[[Military Cryptanalytics]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Callimahos, Lambros D.  |author2=Friedman, William F  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Military Cryptanalytics, Part II, Volume II |publisher=Aegean Park Press | isbn=0-89412-076-X | location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as a book in itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Callimahos, Lambros D. | title=Traffic Analysis and the Zendian Problem |publisher=Aegean Park Press | isbn=0-89412-161-8 | year=1989 | location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both were published as reprints by [[Aegean Park Press]], Walnut Creek, CA, USA.  There are a few small differences in the ciphertext between these sources, with neither being entirely error-free; indeed, some errors were intentional, and dealing with them is part of the learning process.

Karl Heinz-Everts' Web site provides a link to a downloadable archive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.karlheinz-everts.de/messages.zip
| title=Problem of Zendia – Messages
| publisher=Karl Heinz-Everts
| year=2009
| accessdate=2015-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the "intercepts."  (The site also provides analysis and partial solutions, which should ''not'' be viewed by anyone wishing to learn from working on this exercise.)

==The Dundee Society==
{{Main|Dundee Society}}
Cryptanalists who successfully finished CA-400 became members of the [[Dundee Society]]. This society was founded by Lambros D. Callimahos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic-heritage/historical-figures-publications/hall-of-honor/2003/lcallimahos.shtml
| title=Lambros D. Callimahos, 1910–1977 (NSA Hall of Honor)
| publisher=National Security Agency
| year=2003
| accessdate=2009-11-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was so named after the empty Dundee marmalade jar on his desk, as he couldn't disclose the society's real purpose.

==Map of Zendia==
[[File:Zendia lores.jpg|thumb|Low-resolution map of Zendia from textbook]]

A large print showing the fictional nation of Zendia hangs on the wall of the library at the [[National Cryptologic Museum]], which is operated by the NSA. Copies of this map, shrunken to such a degree that most feature labels are illegible, appear in the previously cited books.
