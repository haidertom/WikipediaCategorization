'''''Alltagsgeschichte''''' is a form of [[microhistory]] that was particularly prevalent amongst German historians during the 1980s. It was founded by historians [[Alf Luedtke]] and [[:de:Hans Medick|Hans Medick]].

The name comes from German, where ''Alltag'' means "everyday life"; it can thus be roughly translated as "everyday history". In this sense, ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can be considered part of the wider Marxian historical school of '[[People's history|history from below]]'. 

The purpose of ''Alltagsgeschichte'' is to find and prove the links between the down-to-earth, everyday, basic experiences of ordinary people in a society, and the broad social and political changes which occur in that society. Because this is such a massively broad endeavour to undertake, it can only feasibly be practised on the most minute of scales. Thus ''Alltagsgeschichte'' becomes a form of microhistory.

Its leading exponents include [[Paul Veyne]] and Michel Rouche in France, and Peter Carr in the United Kingdom. ''Alltagsgeschichte'' can also be linked to the Italian historical doctrine of ''Microstoria'' (microhistory).

A '''battery electric vehicle''' ('''BEV'''), '''pure electric vehicle''' or '''all-electric vehicle''' is a type of [[electric vehicle]] (EV) that uses [[chemical energy]] stored in [[rechargeable battery]] [[battery pack|packs]]. BEVs use [[electric motor]]s and [[motor controller]]s instead of [[internal combustion engine]]s (ICEs) for propulsion. They derive all power from battery packs and thus have no internal combustion engine, [[fuel cell]], or [[fuel tank]]. BEVs include - but are not limited to&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.boringcompany.com/faq/|title=FAQ|website=The Boring Company|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"literally hundreds of electric thrusters now operating in orbit on communications satellites, and ion and Hall thrusters both having  been  successfully  used..." -https://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/SciTechBook/series1/Goebel__cmprsd_opt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; - motorcycles, bicycles, scooters, skateboards, rail cars, watercraft, forklifts, buses, trucks, and cars.

==Terminology==
{{See also|Hybrid electric vehicle|Plug-in hybrid|Plug-in electric vehicle}}
Vehicles using both electric motors and internal combustion engines are examples of [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, and are not considered pure or all-electric vehicles because they cannot be externally charged (operate in charge-sustaining mode) and instead they are continually recharged with power from the [[internal combustion engine]] and [[regenerative braking]].&lt;ref name=PEVs/&gt;

[[Hybrid vehicle]]s with batteries that can be charged externally to displace some or all of their internal combustion engine power and [[gasoline]] fuel are called [[plug-in hybrid]] electric vehicles (PHEV), and run as BEVs during their [[charge-depleting]] mode. PHEVs with a [[Hybrid vehicle drivetrain#Series hybrid|series]] [[powertrain]] are also called range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs), such as the [[Chevrolet Volt]] and [[Fisker Karma]].

[[Plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PEVs) are a subcategory of [[electric vehicle]]s that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and [[electric vehicle conversion]]s of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional [[internal combustion engine]] vehicles.&lt;ref name=PEVs&gt;{{cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B. Sandalow]]|year=2009 |publisher=The Brookings Institution |isbn=978-0-8157-0305-1|edition=1st.|url=http://www.brookings.edu/press/Books/2009/pluginelectricvehicles.aspx|pages=2–5}}''See definition on pp. 2.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CSE&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energycenter.org/index.php/technical-assistance/transportation/electric-vehicles|title=Plug-in Electric Vehicles (PEVs)|publisher=Center for Sustainable Energy, California|accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, plug-in electric vehicles, together with hybrid electric vehicles are called new energy vehicles (NEVs).&lt;ref name=NEVs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EXTNEWSCHINESE/Resources/3196537-1202098669693/EV_Report_en.pdf|title=The China New Energy Vehicles Program - Challenges and Opportunities |author=PRTM Management Consultants |publisher=World Bank |date=April 2011|accessdate=2012-02-29}} ''See Acronyms and Key Terms, pp. v''&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the United States, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s (NEVs) are battery electric vehicles that are legally limited to roads with posted speed limits no higher than 45 miles per hour (72&amp;nbsp;km/h), are usually built to have a top speed of 30 miles per hour (48&amp;nbsp;km/h), and have a maximum loaded weight of 3,000&amp;nbsp;lbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://green.autoblog.com/2009/02/06/greenlings-what-is-a-neighborhood-electric-vehicle-nev/|title=What is a neighborhood electric vehicle (NEV)?|date=2009-02-06|publisher= AutoblogGreen| accessdate=2010-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicles by type==
The concept of battery electric vehicles is to use charged [[electric vehicle battery|batteries]] on board vehicles for propulsion. Battery electric cars are becoming more and more attractive with the advancement of new battery technology ([[Lithium Ion]]) that have higher power and [[energy density]] (i.e., greater possible acceleration and more range with fewer batteries) and higher oil prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|title=-|publisher=|accessdate=30 May 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205073246/http://www.4futureenergy.com/BatteryElectric.htm|archivedate=5 February 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BEVs include [[automobile]]s, [[Truck#Light trucks|light trucks]], and [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s.

====First Fast-Charge, Battery-Electric Transit Bus====
[[Proterra, Inc.|Proterra]]'s EcoRide BE35 transit bus, called the Ecoliner by Foothill Transit in West Covina, California, is a heavy duty, fast charge, battery-electric bus. Proterra's ProDrive drive-system uses a [[UQM]] motor and regenerative braking that captures 90 percent of the available energy and returns it to the TerraVolt energy storage system, which in turn increases the total distance the bus can drive by 31–35 percent. It can travel 30–40 miles on a single charge, is up to 600 percent more fuel-efficient than a typical diesel or CNG bus, and produces 44 percent less carbon than CNG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.proterra.com/index.php/mediacenter/companynews/proterra_launches_first_deployment_of_all-electric_zero-emission_buses/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830021744/http://www.proterra.com/index.php/mediacenter/companynews/proterra_launches_first_deployment_of_all-electric_zero-emission_buses/ |archivedate=30 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of production battery electric vehicles|electric car use by country}}

A battery-powered [[electric car]] is an [[automobile]] which is [[ground propulsion|propelled]] by [[electric motor]]s.

Although electric cars often give good acceleration and have generally acceptable top speed, the lower [[specific energy]] of production batteries available in 2015 compared with [[carbon-based fuel]]s means that electric cars need batteries that are fairly large fraction of the vehicle mass but still often give relatively low range between charges. Recharging can also take significant lengths of time. For journeys within a single battery charge, rather than long journeys, electric cars are practical forms of transportation and can be recharged overnight.

[[Formula E]] is a fully electric international single seater championship. The series was conceived in 2012, and the inaugural championship started in Beijing on 13 September 2014. The series is sanctioned by the FIA. Alejandro Agag is the current CEO of Formula E.

The Formula E championship is currently contested by ten teams with two drivers each (after the withdrawal of Team Trulli, there are temporarily only nine teams competing). Racing generally takes place on temporary city-center street circuits which are approximately 2 to 3.4&amp;nbsp;km (1.2 to 2.1&amp;nbsp;mi) long. Currently, only the Mexico City ePrix takes place on a road course, a modified version of the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez.

===Environmental benefits of the use of electric vehicles===
Electric vehicles produce no [[Greenhouse gas|GHG]] emissions, at the tailpipe.
So they are considered 'green' because they have no emissions in the place where they are used.
However, battery electric vehicles can be considered [[Zero emission engines]] only locally, because they generally produce GHG in the power plants where electricity is generated.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/attach/2015/11/Cleaner-Cars-from-Cradle-to-Grave-exec-summary.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 
The two factors driving these GHG emissions of Battery Electric Vehicles are:
* the Carbon intensity of the electricity used to recharge the Electric Vehicle (commonly expressed in grams of CO2 per kWh)
* the consumption of the specific vehicle (in kilometers/kWh)
The Carbon Intensity of electricity can largely vary, depending on the electricity mix of the geographic region where electricity is consumed (a Country with high shares of renewables in his electricity mix will have a low C.I.).
In the European Union, in 2013, the Carbon Intensity had a strong geographic variability, but in almost all the Member States Electric vehicles were "greener" than conventional ones. On average, Electric car saved 50%-60% of CO2 emissions compared to diesel and gasoline fuelled engines. 
Moreover, the de-carbonisation process is constantly reducing the GHG emissions due to the use of Electric Vehicles. In the European Union, on average, between 2009 and 2013 there was a reduction of the electricity Carbon Intensity of 17%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Lonza L|title=Electricity carbon intensity in European Member States: Impacts on GHG emissions of electric vehicles|journal=Transportation Research part D, 2017|doi=10.1016/j.trd.2017.07.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Life-cycle assessment]] perspective, considering the GHG necessary to build the battery and its end-of-life, the GHG savings are 10-13% lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moro A|last2=Helmers E|title=A new hybrid method for reducing the gap between WTW and LCA in the carbon footprint assessment of electric vehicles|journal=Int J Life Cycle Assess (2017) 22: 4|doi=10.1007/s11367-015-0954-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Special-purpose vehicle]]s come in a wide range of types, ranging from relatively common ones such as [[golf cart]]s, things like [[electric golf trolley]]s, [[milk float]]s, [[all-terrain vehicle]]s, [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, and a wide range of other devices. Certain manufacturers specialize in electric-powered "in plant" work machines.

===Electric motorcycles, scooters and rickshaws===

China has experienced an explosive growth of sales of non-assisted e-bikes including scooter type, with annual sales jumping from 56,000 units in 1998 to over 21&amp;nbsp;million in 2008,&lt;ref name=Chi-Taiw&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.duke.edu/~cy42/EV.pdf|title=Launching strategy for electric vehicles: Lessons from China and Taiwan|author=Chi-Jen Yang|year=2010|pages=831–834|issue=77|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change |deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331153729/http://www.duke.edu/~cy42/EV.pdf|archivedate=31 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reaching an estimated 120&amp;nbsp;million e-bikes on the road in early 2010. China is the world's leading manufacturer of e-bikes, with 22.2 million units produced in 2009. Some of the biggest manufacturers of E-bikes in the world are [[BYD Company|BYD]], Geoby.

===Personal transporters===
An increasing variety of [[personal transporter]]s are being manufactured, including the one-wheeled [[self-balancing unicycle]]s, [[self-balancing scooter]]s, [[electric kick scooter]]s, and [[electric skateboard]]s.

===Electric boats===
{{main|Electric boat}}

===Motor controllers===
{{Main|Motor controller}}
The motor controller receives a signal from [[potentiometers]] linked to the accelerator pedal, and it uses this signal to determine how much electric power is needed&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork"&gt;{{cite web |title=How Exactly Do Electric Cars Work? |url=https://www.greencarfuture.com/electric/2018/11/11/how-exactly-do-electric-cars-work.html|website=Green Car Future |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This [[DC power]] is supplied by the battery pack, and the controller regulates the power to the motor, supplying either variable pulse width DC or variable frequency variable amplitude AC, depending on the motor type. The controller also handles [[regenerative braking]], whereby electrical power is gathered as the vehicle slows down and this power recharges the battery&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;. In addition to power and motor management, the controller performs various safety checks such as anomaly detection, functional safety tests and failure diagnostics&lt;ref name="HitachiReview"&gt;{{cite web |title=Components and Systems for Electric Vehicles (HEVs/EVs) |url=http://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2018/r2018_01/10b02/index.html|website=Hitachi Review |accessdate=22 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.


===Battery Pack===
{{main|Battery (electricity)}}

Most electric vehicles today use an [[electric battery]], consisting of [[electrochemical cell]]s with external connections in order to provide power to the vehicle.&lt;ref name=battRef2000&gt;
{{cite book |title=Battery Reference Book |edition=third|last=Crompton|first=T. R. |date=2000-03-20 |publisher=Newnes |page=Glossary 3 |isbn=0080499953 |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=QmVR7qiB5AUC&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;ots=ckHhIPVdcC&amp;dq=battery%20one%20or%20more%20cells&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2016-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Battery technology for EVs has developed from early [[lead-acid batteries]] used in the late 19th Century to the 2010s, to [[lithium-ion batteries]] which are found in most EVs today&lt;ref name="HitachiReview" /&gt;. The overall battery is referred to as a [[battery pack]], which is a group of multiple battery modules and cells. The battery pack powering modern EVs can have as little as 96 battery cells to as many as 2,976 cells&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

===Motors===
{{Main|Traction motor}}
Electric cars have traditionally used series wound DC motors, a form of [[brushed DC electric motor]]. Separately excited and permanent magnet are just two of the types of DC motors available. More recent electric vehicles have made use of a variety of [[AC motor]] types, as these are simpler to build and have no brushes that can wear out. These are usually [[induction motor]]s or [[brushless AC electric motor]]s which use permanent magnets. There are several variations of the permanent magnet motor which offer simpler drive schemes and/or lower cost including the [[brushless DC electric motor]].

Once electric power is supplied to the motor (from the controller), the magnetic field interaction inside the motor will turn the [[drive shaft]] and ultimately the vehicle's wheels&lt;ref name="GreenCarFutureHowEVsWork" /&gt;.

A '''broadcast range''' (also '''listening range''' or '''listening area''' for [[radio]], or '''viewing range''' or '''viewing area''' for [[television]]) is the service area that a [[broadcasting|broadcast station]] or other [[transmission (radio)|transmission]] covers via [[radio wave]]s (or possibly [[infrared]] [[light]], which is closely related).  It is generally the area in which a station's [[signal strength]] is sufficient for most [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]s to decode it. However, this also depends on [[electromagnetic interference|interference]] from other stations.

==Legal definitions==
The "primary service area" is the area served by a station's strongest signal.  The "city-grade contour" is 70 dBµ ([[decibel]]s relative to one microvolt per meter of signal strength) or 3.16mV/m (millivolts per meter) for FM stations in the [[United States]], according to [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) regulations.  This is also significant in [[broadcast law]], in that a station must cover its [[city of license]] within this area, except for [[non-commercial educational]] and [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] stations.

The legally protected range of a station extends beyond this range, out to the point where signal strength is expected to be 1mV/m for most stations in [[North America]], though for [[List_of_North_American_broadcast_station_classes#AM|class B1]] stations it is 0.7mV/m, and as low as 0.5mV/m for full class B stations (the maximum allowed in densely [[population|populate]]d areas of both [[Canada]] and the U.S.).

==Practical application==
In reality, [[radio propagation]] changes along with the [[weather]] and [[tropospheric ducting]], and occasionally along with other upper-[[atmospheric]] phenomena like [[sunspot]]s and even [[meteor shower]]s.  Thus, while a [[broadcasting authority]] might fix the range to an area with exact [[Boundary (topology)|boundaries]] (defined as a series of [[Euclidean vector|vector]]s), this is rarely if ever true.  When a broadcast reaches well outside of its intended range due to [[anomalous propagation|unusual conditions]], [[DXing]] is possible.

The local terrain can also play a major role in limiting broadcast range.  [[Mountain range]]s block [[FM broadcast]]s, [[AM broadcast]]s, and TV broadcasts, and other signals in the [[VHF]] and especially [[UHF]] ranges, respectively.  This [[terrain shielding]] occurs when the line of sight is blocked by something through which the [[radio wave]]s cannot pass, particularly stone.  At times this may be [[wikt:Moot|moot]] due to weather, such as when the tall [[cumulonimbus]] clouds of a [[squall line]] of [[thunderstorm]]s reflect the signal over the top, like an extremely tall [[radio tower]].  Conversely, heavy rain may [[attenuate]] the range of even local stations.  [[ATSC]] [[digital television]] is affected by wind and trees (even if not surrounding the transmitter or receiver locations), apparently related to its use of [[8VSB]] [[modulation]] instead of [[COFDM]].

[[AM broadcasting]] stations have different issues, due to using the [[mediumwave]] band.  Broadcast range in these stations is determined by [[ground conductivity]], and the proper use and [[Preventive maintenance|maintenance]] of [[grounding radial]]s which act as a [[ground plane]] for the [[mast radiator]]s used.  [[Skywaves]] reflect off the [[ionosphere]] at a much greater distance above [[Earth's surface]] at night.  This in turn causes mediumwave, most [[shortwave]], and even [[longwave]] stations to travel much further at night, which is the side of the Earth where the [[solar wind]] pulls the ionosphere (and [[magnetosphere]]) away from the [[planet]], instead of pushing toward it as on the day side.  Because of this, many AM stations must cut power or go off-air at night, except for the very earliest stations still [[grandfathered]] on [[clear-channel station|clear channel]]s.  [[Border blaster]] stations in northern [[Mexico]] also used this effect, along with very high-[[electrical power|power]] [[transmitter]]s, to extend their nighttime broadcast ranges well over the [[US/Mexico border]] and across most of the United States.

Various [[broadcast relay station]]s can help to extend a station's area by retransmitting them on the same or another [[channel (communications)|channel]].  What is usually called a [[repeater]] in [[amateur radio]] is called a [[broadcast translator]] (different channel) or booster (same channel) in [[American broadcasting]], or the much broader category or [[rebroadcaster]]s in [[Canadian broadcasting]] (which includes more than just the [[low-power broadcasting]] used in the U.S.)  Boosters are used only within the broadcast range of the parent station, and serve the same function locally as regional and national [[single-frequency network]]s do in [[Europe]]. [[Distributed transmission]] has also undergone tests in the U.S., but to preserve stations' [[market share]] in their home [[media market]]s, these will be limited to the broadcast area of a single large station.  [[Satellite radio]], which is designed for use without a dish, also uses ground repeaters in large cities due to the many obstructions their high-rise buildings cause to the many current and potential customers that are concentrated there.

==Edge-of-range issues==
Those at the edge of a station's broadcast range will typically notice [[White noise|static]] in an [[analog signal|analog]] broadcast, while [[error correction]] will keep a [[Digital signal (electronics)|digital signal]] clear until it hits the [[cliff effect]] and suddenly disappears completely.  [[FM broadcasting|FM]] stations may flip back and forth (sometimes [[picket-fencing|annoyingly rapidly]] when moving) due to the [[capture effect]], while [[amplitude modulation|AM]] stations (including TV video) may overlay or fade with each other.

[[FM stereo]] will tend to get static more quickly than the [[monaural|monophonic]] sound due to its use of [[subcarrier]]s, so stations may choose to extend the usable part of their range by disabling the [[stereo generator]].  Listeners can also choose to disable stereo decoding on the receiver, though loss of the stereo [[pilot tone]] causes this to happen automatically.  Because this tends to turn on and off when at the threshold of reception, and the threshold is often set too low by the [[manufacturer]]'s [[product design]], manually disabling this when at the edge of the broadcast range prevents the annoying noisy-stereo/quiet-mono switching.

The same is true of [[analog TV]] stereo and [[second audio program]]s, and even for color TV, all of which use subcarriers.  [[Radio reading service]]s and other subcarrier services will also tend to suffer from dropouts sooner than the main station.

Technologies are available that allow for switching to a different signal carrying the same radio program when leaving the broadcast range of a station.  [[Radio Data System]] allows for switching to a different FM or station with the same [[identifier]], or even to (but not necessarily from) an AM station.  Satellite radio also is designed to switch seamlessly between repeaters and/or satellite when moving outside the range of one or the other.  [[HD Radio]] switches back to the analog signal as a [[HD Radio|fallback]] when the edge of the digital range is encountered, but the success of this from the listener's perspective depends on how well the station's [[broadcast engineer]] has synchronized the two.

==Digital versus analog==
Digital transmissions require less power to be received clearly than analog ones.  The exact figure for various modes depends on how robust the signal is made to begin with, such as modulation, [[guard interval]], and [[forward error correction]].  In each of these three factors, the [[caveat emptor|caveat]] is that a higher [[data signaling rate]] means a [[tradeoff]] with reduced broadcast range.  The [[hierarchical modulation]] used on [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] is a unique case, which reduces the range of the full-[[screen resolution|definition]] signal, in exchange for an increase in the usable range of the lower-definition part of the video.

Digital stations in North America usually are operated by the same groups as the analog side, and thus operate their own independent facilities.  Because of this, the FCC requires U.S. TV stations to replicate their analog coverage with their digital signal as well.  However, ATSC digital TV only requires about one-fifth the amount of power to reach the same area on the same channel as analog does.  For HD Radio, the figure is only one percent of the station's analog [[watt]]age, in part because it is an [[in-band on-channel]] method, which uses [[sideband]]s that must prevent interference to [[adjacent channel]]s, especially for older or cheaper receivers which have insufficient [[sensitivity (radio receiver)|sensitivity]] and/or [[selectivity (electronic)|selectivity]].

'''Closed-loop communication''' is a [[communication]] technique used to avoid misunderstandings. When the sender gives a message, the receiver repeats this back. The sender then confirms the message; thereby common is using the word “''yes''”. When the receiver incorrectly repeats the message back, the sender will say “negative” (or something similar) and then repeat the correct message. If the sender (person giving the message) does not get a reply back, she must repeat it until the receiver starts closing the loop. To get the attention of the receiver, the sender can use the receiver's name or functional position, touch his or her shoulder, etc.

'''''Cléopâtre captive''''' is a five-act [[tragedy]] by [[Étienne Jodelle]], presented on 9 February 1553, first before the King [[Henri II of France]] in the Hôtel de Reims, then at the [[Collège de Boncourt]]. The [[play (theatre)|play]] is part of the posthumous collection ''Les Œuvres et meslanges poetiques d'Estienne Jodelle Sieur du Lymodin'' (1574). [[Remy Belleau]] played the role of [[Cleopatra]], [[Jean Bastier de La Péruse]], that of [[Augustus|Octavian]]. It was the first "{{Interlanguage link multi|tragédie humaniste|fr}}", and Jodelle composed it in parallel with the first "[[humanism|humanist]] [[comedy]]", ''{{Interlanguage link multi|L'Eugène|fr}}''.

The performance was a success, and was followed by a celebration in the antique manner in [[Arcueil]], bringing together all participants and friends for a party known as the {{Interlanguage link multi|Pompe du bouc|fr}}.

== Summary ==
* '''Act 1''' : [[Mark Antony|Antony]]'s shadow announces to [[Cleopatra]] that she must die.
* '''Act 2''' : [[Augustus|Octavian]] fears that Cleopatra will commit suicide.
* '''Act 3''' : Cleopatra seeks to commiserate Octavian, offering him riches. Seleucus the servant reveals that she hides part.
* '''Act 4''' : Cleopatra decides to die.
* '''Act 5''' : Proculus narrates to Octavian the death of the Queen.

Jodelle was the first to use [[French alexandrine|alexandrine]]s in a tragedy (acts I and IV), but he also resorted to [[decasyllable]]s (acts II, III, V). In the choirs, he resorted to various meters: some verse have only three syllables.

The subject is taken from [[Plutarch]] (''Life of [[Mark Antony|Antony]]''). The action is reduced: the play tells the decision to die taken by Cleopatra and its implementation.

'''Commensurability''' is a concept in the [[philosophy of science]] whereby [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]] are commensurable if scientists can discuss them using a shared [[nomenclature]] that allows direct comparison of theories to determine which theory is [[scientific realism|more valid or useful]].  On the other hand, theories are '''incommensurable''' if they are embedded in starkly contrasting [[Paradigm|conceptual frameworks]] whose languages do not overlap sufficiently to permit scientists to directly compare the theories or to cite [[empirical evidence]] favoring one theory over the other.  Discussed by [[Ludwik Fleck]] in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/fleck/ Ludwik Fleck (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]; Fleck's term for incommensurability was "''niewspółmierność''".&lt;/ref&gt; and popularized by [[Thomas Kuhn]] in the 1960s, the problem of incommensurability results in scientists talking past each other, as it were, while comparison of theories is muddled by confusions about terms, contexts and consequences.

== Introduction of the term ==

In 1962, [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] both independently introduced the idea of incommensurability to the philosophy of science. In both cases the [[concept]] came from [[mathematics]] and in its original sense is defined as the absence of a common unit of measurement that would allow a direct and exact measurement of two [[variable (research)|variables]], such as the prediction of the [[diagonal]] of a [[square (geometry)|square]] from the relationship of its [[Edge (geometry)|sides]].

The term commensurability was coined because of a series of problems that both authors found when trying to interpret successive scientific [[theories]]. Without doubt its implementation is better understood thanks to the critiques that both Kuhn and Feyerabend have made in response to certain [[thesis|theses]] proposed by followers of the [[received view of theories]]. These include the famous ''thesis on the accumulation of scientific knowledge'', which states that the body of [[scientific knowledge]] has been increasing with the passage of time. Both Kuhn and Feyerabend reject this thesis, in favor of a [[scientific modelling|model]] that sees both [[Paradigm shift|revolutions]] and periods of [[Normal science|normalcy]] in the [[history of science]].

Another equally important thesis proposes the existence of a [[standard language|neutral language]] of comparison which can be used to formulate the [[empiricism|empirical consequences]] of two competing theories. This would allow one to choose the theory with the greatest empirically verified contents or explanatory powers &amp;ndash; or the greatest content that is not falsified if the formulation is [[Karl Popper|Popperian]].

The idea at the root of this second thesis does not just relate to the existence of said language but also implies at least two further postulates.{{original research inline|date=March 2015}} Firstly, this choice between theories presupposes that they can be intertranslated, for example between theory A and its successor B – and in the case of Popper that B can be deduced from A. Secondly, it is assumed that the choice is always carried out under the same standards of [[rationality]].

In both cases the concept of incommensurability makes the viability of the thesis impossible. In the first, by showing that certain empirical consequences are lost between successive theories. In the second case, by confirming that it is possible to make a rational choice between theories even when they can not be translated into a neutral language. However, although the reasons for the introduction of these counter arguments, and the criticism from which they arise, are the same, the sense in which the coauthors use them are in no way identical. For this reason the idea of incommensurability will be discussed for each coauthor separately.

== Perspectives ==

=== Feyerabend's perspectives ===
Feyerabend locates incommensurability within a principle from the field of [[semantics]] which has the underlying idea that the change in significance in the basic terms of a theory changes the totality of the terms of the new theory, so that there are no empirically common meanings between T and T'.

Feyerabend is credited with coining the modern philosophical sense of "incommensurability,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Bas Van Fraassen|Van Fraassen]], Bas. ''The Empirical Stance''. Yale UP: 2002. p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oberheim and Hoyningen-Huene. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/incommensurability/#FeyRouInc "The Incommensurability of Scientific Theories"] in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. "...he had developed his notion of the incommensurability of scientific theories more than ten years prior to the appearance of Kuhn's Structure of Scientific Revolutions (1962)"&lt;/ref&gt; which lays the foundation for much of his philosophy of science. He first presented his notion of incommensurability in 1952 to [[Karl Popper]]'s [[London School of Economics]] seminar and to a gathering of illustrious Wittgensteinians ([[Elizabeth Anscombe]], [[Peter Geach]], [[H. L. A. Hart]] and [[Georg Henrik von Wright]]) in [[G. E. M. Anscombe|Anscombe's]] Oxford flat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feyerabend/|title = Paul Feyerabend |accessdate=4 February 2012|author = Preston, John|date = 1 June 2009|publisher = [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feyerabend argued that frameworks of thought, and thus [[scientific paradigm]]s, can be incommensurable for three reasons. Briefly put, Feyerabend's notion of incommensurability is as follows:
# The interpretation of observations is implicitly influenced by theoretical assumptions. It is therefore impossible to describe or evaluate observations independently of theory.
# Paradigms often have different assumptions about which intellectual and operational scientific methods result in valid scientific knowledge.
# Paradigms can be based on different assumptions regarding the structure of their domain, which makes it impossible to compare them in a meaningful way. The adoption of a new theory includes and is dependent upon the adoption of new terms. Thus, scientists are using different terms when talking about different theories. Those who hold different, competing theories to be true will be talking over one another, in the sense that they cannot a priori arrive at agreement given two different discourses with two different theoretical language and dictates.

According to Feyerabend, the idea of incommensurability cannot be captured in [[formal logic]], because it is a phenomenon outside of logic's domain.

==== Theories ====
In 1989, Feyerabend presented an idea informed by Popper's [[critical rationalism]] whereby "investigation starts with a problem. The problem is the result of a conflict between an expectation and an observation, which, in its turn, is formed by the expectation." (Feyerabend, 1989; pp.&amp;nbsp;96). [[Scientific method]]ology then resolves problems by inventing theories that should be relevant and falsifiable, at least to a greater degree than any other alternative solution. Once an alternative theory is presented the critical phase commences regarding T' which must answer the following questions: (a) why has theory T been successful up until now and (b) why has it failed. If the new theory T' answers both questions then T is discarded.

That is, a new theory T', in order to be an adequate successor to the refuted theory T, must have a collection of additional predictions regarding T (Class A), as well as a collection of successful predictions that coincide to a certain degree with the old theory (Class S). These Class S predictions constitute those parts of the new theory containing new truths and they therefore exclude a series of consequences of T, the failures in the old theory, which are part of the untrue (false) contents of the new theory (Class F).

Given this model it is possible to construct [[Relational theory|relational statements]] between certain terms from T and from T', which will be the basis for the comparison between the theories. This will allow a choice between the two in the light of their empirical contents. But, if we come across a theory T' in which Class S is empty then the theories are incommensurable with each other.

However, Feyerabend clarifies this by stating that, incommensurability between T and T' will depend on the interpretation given to the theories. If this is instrumental, every theory that refers to the same language of [[observation]] will be commensurable. In the same way, if a [[Philosophical realism|realist]] perspective is sought then it will favour a unified position which employs the most highly abstracted terms of whatever theory is being considered in order to describe both theories, giving a significance to the observational statements as a function of these terms, or, at least to replace the habitual use they are given.

It can be noted that the instrumentalist interpretation recognizes the existence of certain statements whose truth is not only dependent on the observational statements but also on the evaluation criteria they are subjected to, which are anchored in the theories. For example, to afirm the relational character of [[longitude]], this asseveration can not be decided solely using observational terms. Its truth value, in part, depends on the theory that establishes the sense in which the terms are used. In this case they relate to [[quantum mechanics]] (QM) as opposed to [[classical mechanics]] (CM). In this sense, the instrumentalist position only deals with the empirical consequences and leaves to one side the relationship that the concepts have with each other.

In this same way Feyerabend comments that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/13238504|title=Philosophical papers|last=Feyerabend|first=Paul|date=1985|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=0521316421|edition=1st|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=13238504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It is certain, of course, that the relativist scheme has very often given us numbers that are practically identical to the numbers obtained from CM, but this does not mean that the concepts are very similar...[For] even if ...yielding strictly identical predictions can be used as an argument to show that the concepts must match, at least in this case, different magnitudes based on different concepts can give identical values for their respective scales while being different magnitudes...[So] it is not possible to make a comparison of the contents, nor is it possible to make a judgement regarding its verisimilitude.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]}}

==== Realist objections ====

In relation to realist objections, Feyerabend returns to an [[argument]] elaborated by [[Carnap]] and comments that the use of such abstract concepts leads to an impossible position, as "...theoretical terms receive their interpretation by being connected with an observational language and those terms are empty without that connection." (Feyerabend, pp.&amp;nbsp;373). As before it follows that they can not be used to confer significance to the observational language as this observational language is its only source of significance, with which it is not possible to make a translation but only a restatement of the term.

Therefore, Feyerabend considers that both the instrumentalist and the realist interpretations are flawed, as they try to defend the idea that incommensurability is a legitimately unsolvable idea with which to revoke the theses of the accumulation of knowledge and [[panrationalism]] in science. 
 
This leads to the following consideration: if each new theory has its own observational basis, within the meaning of the theoretical framework, how can we hope that the observations that are produced could eventually refute it. Furthermore, how can we actually recognize that the new position explains what it is supposed to explain or if it is deviating off into other areas and therefore how can the theories be definitively compared.

Feyerabend's answer to the first consideration lies in noting that the initial terms of a theory depend on the postulates of the theory and their associated grammatical rules, in addition, the predictions derived from the theory also depend on the underlying conditions of the system. Feyerabend doesn't explore the point further, but it can be assumed that if the prediction does not agree with the observation and if we have a high degree of confidence in the description that we have made from the initial [[material conditional|conditions]] than we can be sure that the error must be present in our theory and in its underlying terms. 
 
In dealing with the second consideration Feyerabend asks "why should it be necessary to have a [[terminology]] that allows us to say that two theories refer to the same experiment. This supposes a unificationist or possibly a realist aspiration, whose objective appears to be the truth, however, it is assumed that the theory can be compared under a criterion of empirical adequacy. Such an approach would build on the relationship established between the observational statement that describes the outcome of an experiment formulated for each theory independently, which is compared with the predictions that each theory posits. In this way the selection is made when a theory is an empirically better fit. If the objection to the possible deviation of the new theory is not answered it is irrelevant as often history has shown that in fact differing points of view change or modify their fields of application, for example the physics of [[Aristotle]] and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]."

==== Theory selection ====
{{See also|Models of scientific inquiry#Choice of a theory}}
The above implies that the process of choosing between theories does not obey a universal rationality. Feyerabend has the following view regarding whether the absence of a universal rationality constitutes an irrational position:

{{quote|No, because each individual event is rational in the sense that some of its features can be explained by reasons that are or were accepted at the time in which they occurred, or that were invented in the course of their development. Yes, because even these local reasons, which change over time, are not sufficient to explain all the important features of a particular event.|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend uses this reasoning to try to shed light on one of Popper's arguments, which says that we are always able to change any statement, even those reference systems that guide our critical thinking. However, the two thinkers reach different conclusions, Popper assumes that it is always possible to make a criticism once the new criteria have been accepted, so the selection can be seen as the result of a rationality "''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''" to the selection. While, Feyerabend's position is that this solution is merely a verbal ornament whenever the standards are influenced by Popper's first world, the physical world, and they are not just developed in the third world. That is, the standards are influenced by the expectations of their originators, the stances they imply and the ways of interpreting the world they favour, but this is strictly analogous to the same process of the scientific revolution, that leads us to believe that the thesis of incommensurability can also be applied to standards, as is shown by the following asseveration:

{{quote|Even the most puritanical rationalist will be forced to stop arguing and use propaganda, for example, not because some of their arguments have become invalid, but because the psychological conditions have disappeared that allowed effective argument and therefore influence over the others|[[Paul Feyerabend]]|source={{citation needed|date=April 2016}}}}

Feyerabend states that the Popperian criticism is either related to certain clearly defined procedures, or is totally abstract and leaves others with the task of fleshing it out later with specific contents, making Popper's rationality a "mere verbal ornament." This does not imply that Feyerabend is an [[irrationalist]] but that he considers that the process of scientific change can not be explained in its totality in the light of some rationality, precisely because of incommensurability.

=== Kuhn's perspectives ===
The second coauthor of the thesis of incommensurability is [[Thomas Kuhn]], who introduced it in his 1962 book, ''[[The structure of scientific revolutions]]'', in which he describes it as a universal property that defines the relationship between successive [[paradigm]]s. Under this meaning incommensurability goes beyond the field of semantics and covers everything relating to its practical application, from the study of problems to the associated methods and rules for their resolution. However, the meaning of the term was continually refined throughout Kuhn's work, he first placed it within the field of semantics and applied a narrow definition, but later he redefined it in a [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] sense, wherein changes are found in the relationships between similarities and differences that the subjects of a defining matrix draw over the world.

In The Structure of Scientific Revolutions Kuhn wrote that "the historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them".&lt;ref name=SSR/&gt;{{rp|111}} According to Kuhn, the proponents of different scientific paradigms cannot fully appreciate or understand the other's point of view because they are, as a way of speaking, living in different worlds. Kuhn gave three reasons for this inability:
# Proponents of competing paradigms have different ideas about the importance of solving various scientific problems, and about the standards that a solution should satisfy.
# The vocabulary and problem-solving methods that the paradigms use can be different: the proponents of competing paradigms utilize a different conceptual network.
# The proponents of different paradigms see the world in a different way because of their scientific training and prior experience in research.

In a postscript (1969) to ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', Kuhn added that he thought that incommensurability was, at least in part, a consequence of the role of [[similarity sets]] in normal science. Competing paradigms group concepts in different ways, with different similarity relations. According to Kuhn, this causes fundamental problems in communication between proponents of different paradigms. It is difficult to change such categories in one's mind, because the groups have been learned by means of exemplars instead of definitions. This problem cannot be resolved by using a neutral language for communication, according to Kuhn, since the difference occurs prior to the application of language.

Kuhn's thinking on incommensurability was probably in some part influenced by his reading of [[Michael Polanyi]] who held that there can be a logical gap between belief systems and who also said that scientists from different schools, "think differently, speak a different language, live in a different world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1008553295|title=Personal knowledge : towards a post-critical philosophy|last=Polanyi|first=Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=9780203442159|location=London|pages=151|oclc=1008553295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Phases ====

Given his changing definition of incommensurability Pérez Ransanz has identified three phases in Kuhn's work, or at least in how it deals with this concept. As we have seen above the first phase was seen in ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' (SSR) and it is characterized by an overall vision that is applied to paradigms. This perspective was replaced in the 1970s by a localist and semanticist vision in which incommensurability is now defined as the relationship between two theories that are articulated in two languages that are not completely interchangeable, as Kuhn states in the following extract:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/756577696|title=The structure of scientific revolutions|last=Kuhn|first=Thomas S.|publisher=|others=Hacking, Ian,|year=|isbn=9780226458113|edition= Fourth|location=Chicago|pages=|oclc=756577696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The phrase "without common measure" is converted into "without common language". To state that two theories are incommensurable means that there is no neutral language, or other type of language, into which both theories, conceived as sets of statements, can be translated without remainder or loss... [Although] the majority of the terms shared by the two theories function in the same way in both...|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

The above only prohibits one type of comparison, that which is carried out between the statements of these two theories in a one-to-one relationship. An idea that underlies this formulation is that translation implies [[symmetry]] and [[transitive relation|transitivity]] so that if theory T is translatable with theory T', then T' can be translated to T, and furthermore if there is a third theory T'' and this can be translated to T', then theories T and T' cannot be incommensurable, as long as the transitive relationship and the symmetrical relationship assures that their statements can be compared one to another.

It should be noted that Kuhn did not deny that two incommensurable theories may have a common reference environment and in this sense he did not state that it was impossible to compare them, his thesis solely refers to the ability to translate the statements belonging to two theories in a one-to-one relationship, as is shown in the following passage:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

{{quote|The terms that retain their meanings following a change in theory provide a suitable base for the discussion of the differences and for the comparisons that are relevant in the selection of theories. [Continued in a footnote] It may be noted that these terms are not independent of the theory, but they are simply used in the same way in the two theories in question. It follows that the comparison is a process that compares the two theories, it is not a process that can evaluate the theories separately.|[[Thomas Kuhn]]}}

This is relevant because it allow us to elucidate that Kuhn's sense of [[rationality]] is linked to the ability to comprehend, and not to the same capacity for translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43602287|title=Kuhn y el cambio científico|last=Pérez Ransanz|first=Ana Rosa|date=1999|publisher=Fondo de Cultura Económica|year=|isbn=9681641892|edition=1st|location=México|pages=|language=es|oclc=43602287}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third stage of Kuhn's work the formulation of the thesis of incommensurability became refined in [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomic]] terms and is explained as a function of the change in the relations of similarity and difference between two theories. Kuhn declared that this change relates to the concepts of Class A not only because there is a change in the way of referring to the concepts but also because their underlying structure becomes altered, that is, the meaning changes – its intention – but also its reference. In this way Kuhn states that not all of the semantic changes are changes that lead to incommensurability, they are only those that, by being made in the basic categories, operate in a [[Holism|holistic manner]] meaning that all the relationships between these terms becomes altered. This uses taxonomic terms to define incommensurability as the impossibility to prove the taxonomic structures of two theories, an impossibility that is expressed as a necessarily incomplete translation of the terms.

==== Taxonomic characterization ====

[[Taxonomy (biology)|Taxonomic]] characterization allowed Kuhn to postulate his no-overlap [[principle]], since, if the taxonomic categories are divisions in a logical sense then this implies that the relations established between these concepts and the rest are necessarily hierarchical. It is for exactly this type of relationship that the changes in categories are holistic, as the modification of a category necessarily implies the modification of the surrounding categories, which explains why once the change takes place the taxonomies can not be comparable – they are isomorphic. 
  
This characterization was already present in Kuhn's writing along with remnants of semantic characterization, which he developed in full towards the end of the 1980s in his taxonomic characterization. An advantage of this characterization is the belief that the criteria that allow the identification of a concept with its references are many and varied, so that a coincidence of criteria is not necessary for successful communication except for those categories that are implicated. Kuhn saw the relations between concepts as existing in a multidimensional space, the categories consist of partitions in this space and they must coincide between the communicators, although this is not the case for the criteria that establish a connection between this space and the associated reference.

==== Reluctance ====

An important clarification that should be made, and which constantly appears in Kuhn's writing, is his reluctance to equate translation and interpretation, a comparison that Kuhn attributes to the analytical tradition of [[philosophy]]. Translation is an almost mechanical activity which produces a Quinean translation manual that relates sequences of words in such a way that their truth values are conserved. However, the process of interpretation implies the development of translation hypotheses, which have to be successful when they allow external preferences to be understood in a coherent and meaningful way. Kuhn then rejected the idea of a universal translatability but not the principle of universal intelligibility, a distinction that is very important in understanding Kuhn's rejection of his critics, such as [[Karl Popper|Popper]] and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Davidson]].

However, without a doubt the previous idea invites us to question how is it that we are able to interpret in the first place. Kuhn's solution consists in affirming that this is like learning a new language. How is it that we are able to learn a new language when we are confronted with a holistic change such as is implied by the notion of incommensurability? Kuhn's work suggests four aspects to this question:

* Firstly, in order to carry out such an [[assimilation (psychology)|assimilation]] it is necessary that the complementary [[vocabulary]] is easily understood.
* Secondly, definitions must fulfill a minimal role, it is the paradigmatic examples that introduce the use of the new concepts, in such a way that an ostensive or stipulative component is essential.
* Thirdly, [[Class (philosophy)|class concepts]] cannot be learned in isolation, but in relation to a series of contrast sets.
* Fourthly, the process of learning involves the generation of expectations, which are the basis of the projectability of the class terms, in such a way that in their turn they form the basis of, among other things, inductive inferences. And lastly, as the criteria for relating the class and its reference vary, this forms the way of learning the subject matter.

=== Conclusion ===

It can be concluded that Kuhn's idea of incommensurability, despite its various reformulations, manages to seriously problematize both the idea of accumulation of a neutral language as well as of the very idea of a neutral language, without falling into [[irrationalism]] nor stating that the common reference level is irrelevant. An idea that differentiates him from Feyerabend who states in books such as ''Problems of Empiricism'' and ''[[Against Method]]'' that if the new theory deviates into new areas, this is not a problem of the theory, as often the conceptual progress leads to the disappearance and not to the refutation or resolution of the old questions.

==Meta-incommensurability==
A more general notion of incommensurability has been applied to the sciences at the meta-level in two significant ways.

Eric Oberheim and [[Paul Hoyningen-Huene]] argue that [[Scientific realism|realist]] and [[Anti-realism#Anti-realism in science|anti-realist]] philosophies of science are also incommensurable, thus scientific theories themselves may be meta-incommensurable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=OBERHEIM|first=Eric|last2=HOYNINGEN-HUENE|first2=Paul|date=1997|title=INCOMMENSURABILITY, REALISM AND META-INCOMMENSURABILITY|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/23917953|journal=Theoria: An International Journal for Theory, History and Foundations of Science|volume=12|issue=3(30)|pages=447–465}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Nicholas Best describes a different type of incommensurability between philosophical theories of [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Best|first=Nicholas W.|date=September 2015|title=Meta-Incommensurability between Theories of Meaning: Chemical Evidence|url=https://doi.org/10.1162/POSC_a_00176|journal=Perspectives on Science|language=en|volume=23|issue=3|pages=361–378|doi=10.1162/posc_a_00176|issn=1063-6145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that if the meaning of a first-order scientific theory depends on its second-order theory of meaning, then two first order theories will be meta-incommensurable if they depend on substantially different theories of meaning. Whereas Kuhn and Feyerabend’s concepts of incommensurability do not imply complete incomparability of scientific concepts, this incommensurability of meaning does.

=== Bits ===
[[Computer architecture]]s are often described as ''n''-[[bit]] architectures. Today ''n'' is often 8, 16, 32, or 64, but other sizes have been used. This is actually a strong simplification. A computer architecture often has a few more or less "natural" datasizes in the [[instruction set]], but the hardware implementation of these may be very different. Many architectures have instructions operating on half and/or twice the size of respective processors' major internal datapaths. Examples of this are the [[8080]], [[Z80]], [[MC68000]] as well as many others. On this type of implementations, a twice as wide operation typically also takes around twice as many clock cycles (which is not the case on high performance implementations). On the 68000, for instance, this means 8 instead of 4 clock ticks, and this particular chip may be described as a [[32-bit]] architecture with a [[16-bit]] implementation. The external databus width is often not useful to determine the width of the architecture; the [[NS320xx|NS32008, NS32016 and NS32032]] were basically the same 32-bit chip with different external data buses. The NS32764 had a [[64-bit computing|64-bit]] bus, but used 32-bit registers.

The width of addresses may or may not be different from the width of data.
Early 32-bit microprocessors often had a 24-bit address, as did the [[System/360]] processors.

=== Operands ===
{{main| instruction set#Number of operands}}

The number of operands is one of the factors that may give an indication about the performance of the instruction set.
A three-operand architecture will allow
 A := B + C
to be computed in one instruction.

A two-operand architecture will allow
 A := A + B
to be computed in one instruction, so two instructions will need to be executed to simulate a single three-operand instruction
 A := B
 A := A + C

=== Endianness ===
An architecture may use "big" or "little" endianness, or both, or be configurable to use either. Little endian processors order [[byte]]s in memory with the least significant byte of a multi-byte value in the lowest-numbered memory location. Big endian architectures instead order them with the most significant byte at the lowest-numbered address. The x86 architecture as well as several [[8-bit]] architectures are little endian. Most [[RISC]] architectures (SPARC, Power, PowerPC, MIPS) were originally big endian (ARM was little endian), but many (including ARM) are now configurable.

Endianness ''only'' applies to processors that allow individual addressing of units of data (such as [[bytes]]) that are ''smaller'' than the basic addressable machine word.

== Instruction sets ==
Usually the number of registers is a power of two, e.g. 8, 16, 32. In some cases a hardwired-to-zero pseudo-register is included, as "part" of [[register file]]s of architectures, mostly to simplify indexing modes. This table only counts the integer "registers" usable by general instructions at any moment. Architectures always include special-purpose registers such as the program pointer (PC). Those are not counted unless mentioned. Note that some architectures, such as SPARC, have [[register window]]; for those architectures, the count below indicates how many registers are available within a register window. Also, non-architected registers for [[register renaming#Architectural vs physical registers|register renaming]] are not counted.

Note, a common type of architecture, "load-store", is a synonym for "Register Register" below, meaning no instructions access memory except special – load to register(s) – and store from register(s) – with the possible exceptions of atomic memory operations for locking.

The table below compares basic information about instruction sets to be implemented in the CPU architectures:

'''Computer security compromised by hardware failure''' is a branch of [[computer security]] applied to hardware.
The objective of computer security includes protection of information and property from theft, corruption, or [[natural disaster]], while allowing the information and property to remain accessible and productive to its intended users.&lt;ref name="ComSec1"&gt;[[Computer security]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such secret information could be retrieved by different ways. This article focus on the retrieval of data thanks to misused hardware or hardware failure. Hardware could be misused or exploited to get secret data. This article collects main types of attack that can be lead in a data thief.

Computer security can be comprised by devices, such as keyboards, monitors or printers (thanks to electromagnetic or acoustic emanation for example) or by components of the computer, such as the memory, the network card or the processor (thanks to time or temperature analysis for example).

== Devices ==

=== Monitor ===
The monitor is the main device used to access data on a computer.  It has been shown that monitors radiate or reflect data on their environment, potentially giving attackers access to information displayed on the monitor.

==== Electromagnetic emanations ====
Video display units radiate:
* narrowband harmonics of the digital clock signals ;
* broadband harmonics of the various 'random' digital signals such as the video signal.&lt;ref name="Eck1"&gt;[[#Eck1|Eck, 1985, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Known as compromising emanations or [[TEMPEST]] radiation, a code word for a U.S. government programme aimed at attacking the problem, the electromagnetic broadcast of data has been a significant concern in sensitive computer applications. Eavesdroppers can reconstruct video screen content from radio frequency emanations.&lt;ref name="Kuhn1"&gt;[[#Kuhn1|Kuhn,1998, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Each (radiated) harmonic of the video signal shows a remarkable resemblance to a broadcast TV signal. It is therefore possible to reconstruct the picture displayed on the video display unit from the radiated emission by means of a normal television receiver.&lt;ref name="Eck1"/&gt; If no preventive measures are taken, eavesdropping on a video display unit is possible at distances up to several hundreds of meters, using only a normal black-and-white TV receiver, a directional antenna and an antenna amplifier. It is even possible to pick up information from some types of video display units at a distance of over 1 kilometer. If more sophisticated receiving and decoding equipment is used, the maximum distance can be much greater.&lt;ref name="Eck2"&gt;[[#Eck1|Eck, 1985, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Compromising reflections ====
What is displayed by the monitor is reflected on the environment. The time-varying diffuse reflections of the light emitted by a CRT monitor can be exploited to recover the original monitor image.&lt;ref name="[Back1]"&gt;[[#Back1|Backes, 2010, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an eavesdropping technique for spying at a distance on data that is displayed on an arbitrary computer screen, including the currently prevalent LCD monitors.

The technique exploits reflections of the screen’s optical emanations in various objects that one commonly finds in close proximity to the screen and uses those reflections to recover the original screen content. Such objects include eyeglasses, tea pots, spoons, plastic bottles, and even the eye of the user. This attack can be successfully mounted to spy on even small fonts using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment (less than 1500 dollars) from a distance of up to 10 meters. Relying on more expensive equipment allowed to conduct this attack from over 30 meters away, demonstrating that similar attacks are feasible from the other side of the street or from a close-by building.&lt;ref name="[Back3]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many objects that may be found at a usual workplace can be exploited to retrieve information on a computer’s display by an outsider.&lt;ref name="[Back4]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly good results were obtained from reflections in a user’s eyeglasses or a tea pot located on the desk next to the screen. Reflections that stem from the eye of the user also provide good results. However, eyes are harder to spy on at a distance because they are fast-moving objects and require high exposure times. Using more expensive equipment with lower exposure times helps to remedy this problem.&lt;ref name="[Back5]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.11]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The reflections gathered from curved surfaces on close-by objects indeed pose a substantial threat to the confidentiality of data displayed on the screen. Fully invalidating this threat without at the same time hiding the screen from the legitimate user seems difficult, without using curtains on the windows or similar forms of strong optical shielding. Most users, however, will not be aware of this risk and may not be willing to close the curtains on a nice day.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The reflection of an object, a computer display, in a curved mirror creates a virtual image that is located behind the reflecting surface. For a flat mirror this virtual image has the same size and is located behind the mirror at the same distance as the original object. For curved mirrors, however, the situation is more complex.&lt;ref name="[Back6]"&gt;[[#Back2|Backes, 2008, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Keyboard ===

==== Electromagnetic emanations ====
Computer keyboards are often used to transmit confidential data such as passwords. Since they contain electronic components, keyboards emit electromagnetic waves. These emanations could reveal sensitive information such as keystrokes.&lt;ref name="Vuag1"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Electromagnetic emanations have turned out to constitute a security threat to computer equipment.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt; The figure below presents how a keystroke is retrieved and what material is necessary.

[[File:Keyboard stroke retrieval.png|thumb|center|969px|alt=|Diagram presenting all material necessary to detect keystrokes]]

The approach is to acquire the raw signal directly from the antenna and to process the entire captured electromagnetic spectrum. Thanks to this method, four different kinds of compromising electromagnetic emanations have been detected, generated by '''wired and wireless''' keyboards. These emissions lead to a full or a partial recovery of the keystrokes. The best practical attack fully recovered 95% of the keystrokes of a PS/2 keyboard at a distance up to 20 meters, even through walls.&lt;ref name="Vuag1"/&gt; Because each keyboard has a specific fingerprint based on the clock frequency inconsistencies, it can determine the source keyboard of a compromising emanation, even if multiple keyboards from the same model are used at the same time.&lt;ref name="Vuag2"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The four different kinds way of compromising electromagnetic emanations are described below.

===== The Falling Edge Transition Technique =====
When a key is pressed, released or held down, the keyboard sends a packet of information known as a scan code to the computer.&lt;ref name="Vuag3"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol used to transmit these scan codes is a bidirectional serial communication, based on four wires: Vcc (5 volts), ground, data and clock.&lt;ref name="Vuag3"/&gt; Clock and data signals are identically generated. Hence, the compromising emanation detected is the combination of both signals. However, the edges of the data and the clock lines are not superposed. Thus, they can be easily separated to obtain independent signals.&lt;ref name="Vuag4"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.6]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===== The Generalized Transition Technique =====
The Falling Edge Transition attack is limited to a partial recovery of the keystrokes. This is a significant limitation.&lt;ref name="Vuag5"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.7]]&lt;/ref&gt; The GTT is a falling edge transition attack improved, which recover almost all keystrokes. Indeed, between two traces, there is exactly one data rising edge. If attackers are able to detect this transition, they can fully recover the keystrokes.&lt;ref name="Vuag5"/&gt;

===== The Modulation Technique =====
Harmonics compromising electromagnetic emissions come from unintentional emanations such as radiations emitted by the clock, non-linear elements, crosstalk, ground pollution, etc. Determining theoretically the reasons of these compromising radiations is a very complex task.&lt;ref name="Vuag6"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.8]]&lt;/ref&gt; These harmonics correspond to a carrier of approximately 4&amp;nbsp;MHz which is very likely the internal clock of the micro-controller inside the keyboard. These harmonics are correlated with both clock and data signals, which describe modulated signals (in amplitude and frequency) and the full state of both clock and data signals. This means that the scan code can be completely recovered from these harmonics.&lt;ref name="Vuag6"/&gt;

===== The Matrix Scan Technique =====
Keyboard manufacturers arrange the keys in a matrix. The keyboard controller, often an 8-bit processor, parses columns one-by-one and recovers the state of 8 keys at once. This matrix scan process can be described as 192 keys (some keys may not be used, for instance modern keyboards use 104/105 keys) arranged in 24 columns and 8 rows.&lt;ref name="Vuag7"&gt;[[#Vuag1|Vuagnoux, 2009, p.9]]&lt;/ref&gt; These columns are continuously pulsed one-by-one for at least 3μs. Thus, these leads may act as an antenna and generate electromagnetic emanations. If an attacker is able to capture these emanations, he can easily recover the column of the pressed key. Even if this signal does not fully describe the pressed key, it still gives partial information on the transmitted scan code, i.e. the column number.&lt;ref name="Vuag7"/&gt;

Note that the matrix scan routine loops continuously. When no key is pressed, we still have a signal composed of multiple equidistant peaks. These emanations may be used to remotely detect the presence of powered computers. Concerning wireless keyboards, the wireless data burst transmission can be used as an electromagnetic trigger to detect exactly when a key is pressed, while the matrix scan emanations are used to determine the column it belongs to.&lt;ref name="Vuag7"/&gt;

===== Summary =====
Some techniques can only target some keyboards. This table sums up which technique could be used to find keystroke for different kind of keyboard.

==== Acoustic emanations ====
Attacks against emanations caused by human typing have attracted interest in recent years. In particular, works showed that keyboard acoustic emanations do leak information that can be exploited to reconstruct the typed text.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"&gt;[[#Ber1|Berger, 2006, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

PC keyboards, notebook keyboards are vulnerable to attacks based on differentiating the sound emanated by different keys.&lt;ref name="[Aso1]"&gt;[[#Aso1|Asonov, 2004, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; This attack takes as input an audio signal containing a recording of a single word typed by a single person on a keyboard, and a dictionary of words. It is assumed that the typed word is present in the dictionary. The aim of the attack is to reconstruct the original word from the signal.&lt;ref name="[Ber2]"&gt;[[#Ber1|Berger, 2006, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; This attack, taking as input a 10-minute sound recording of a user typing English text using a keyboard, and then recovering up to 96% of typed characters.&lt;ref name="[Zhu1]"&gt;[[#Zhu1|Zhuang, 2005, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; This attack is inexpensive because the other hardware required is a parabolic microphone and non-invasive because it does not require physical intrusion into the system. The attack employs a neural network to recognize the key being pressed.&lt;ref name="[Aso1]"/&gt; It combines signal processing and efficient data structures and algorithms, to successfully reconstruct single words of 7-13 characters from a recording of the clicks made when typing them on a keyboard.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt; The sound of clicks can differ slightly from key to key, because the keys are positioned at different positions on the keyboard plate, although the clicks of different keys sound similar to the human ear.&lt;ref name="[Aso1]"/&gt;

On average, there were only 0.5 incorrect recognitions per 20 clicks, which shows the exposure of keyboard to the eavesdropping using this attack.&lt;ref name="[Aso2]"&gt;[[#Aso1|Asonov, 2004, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The attack is very efficient, taking under 20 seconds per word on a standard PC. A 90% or better success rate of finding the correct word for words of 10 or more characters, and a success rate of 73% over all the words tested.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt; In practice, a human attacker can typically determine if text is random. An attacker can also identify occasions when the user types user names and passwords.&lt;ref name="[Zhu2]"&gt;[[#Zhu1|Zhuang, 2005, p.4]]&lt;/ref&gt; Short audio signals containing a single word, with seven or more characters long was considered. This means that the signal is only a few seconds long. Such short words are often chosen as a password.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt; The dominant factors affecting the attack's success are the word length, and more importantly, the number of repeated characters within the word.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt;

This is a procedure that makes it possible to efficiently uncover a word out of audio recordings of keyboard click sounds.&lt;ref name="[Ber3]"&gt;[[#Ber1|Berger, 2006, p.8]]&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, extracting information out of an other type of emanations was demonstrated: acoustic emanations from mechanical devices such as dot-matrix printers.&lt;ref name="[Ber1]"/&gt;

==== Video Eavesdropping on Keyboard ====
While extracting private information by watching somebody typing on a keyboard might seem to be an easy task, it becomes extremely challenging if it has to be automated. However, an automated tool is needed in the case of long-lasting surveillance procedures or long user activity, as a human being is able to reconstruct only a few characters per minute. The paper [[#Balz|"ClearShot: Eavesdropping on Keyboard Input from Video"]] presents a novel approach to automatically recovering the text being typed on a keyboard, based solely on a video of the user typing.&lt;ref name="Balz1"&gt;[[#Balz1|Balzarotti, 2008, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Automatically recognizing the keys being pressed by a user is a hard problem that requires sophisticated motion analysis. Experiments show that, for a human, reconstructing a few sentences requires lengthy hours of slow-motion analysis of the video.&lt;ref name="Balz2"&gt;[[#Balz1|Balzarotti, 2008, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt; The attacker might install a surveillance device in the room of the victim, might take control of an existing camera by exploiting a vulnerability in the camera’s control software, or might simply point a mobile phone with an integrated camera at the laptop’s keyboard when the victim is working in a public space.&lt;ref name="Balz2"/&gt;

Balzarotti's analysis is divided into two main phases (figure below).
The '''first phase''' analyzes the video recorded by the camera using computer vision techniques. For each frame of the video, the computer vision analysis computes the set of keys that were likely pressed, the set of keys that were certainly not pressed, and the position of space characters. Because the results of this phase of the analysis are noisy, '''a second phase''', called the text analysis, is required. The goal of this phase is to remove errors using both language and context-sensitive techniques. The result of this phase is the reconstructed text, where each word is represented by a list of possible candidates, ranked by likelihood.&lt;ref name="Balz2"/&gt;

[[File:ClearShot diagram.png|thumb|center|1048px|alt=|Diagram presenting steps to go through when detecting keystroke with video input]]

=== Printer ===

==== Acoustic emanations ====
With acoustic emanations, an attack that recovers what a dot-matrix printer processing English text is printing is possible. It is based on a record of the sound the printer makes, if the microphone is close enough to it. This attack recovers up to 72% of printed words, and up to 95% if knowledge about the text are done, with a microphone at a distance of 10&amp;nbsp;cm from the printer.&lt;ref name="[Back10]"&gt;[[#Back1|Backes, 2010, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

After an upfront training phase ("a" in the picture below), the attack ("b" in the picture below) is fully automated and uses a combination of machine learning, audio processing, and speech recognition techniques, including spectrum features, Hidden Markov Models and linear classification.&lt;ref name="[Back1]"/&gt; The fundamental reason why the reconstruction of the printed text works is that, the emitted sound becomes louder if more needles strike the paper at a given time.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt; There is a correlation between the number of needles and the intensity of the acoustic emanation.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt;

A training phase was conducted where words from a dictionary are printed and characteristic sound features of these words are extracted and stored in a database. The trained characteristic features was used to recognize the printed English text.&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt; But, this task is not trivial. Major challenges include :
# Identifying and extracting sound features that suitably capture the acoustic emanation of dot-matrix printers;
# Compensating for the blurred and overlapping features that are induced by the substantial decay time of the emanations;
# Identifying and eliminating wrongly recognized words to increase the overall percentage of correctly identified words (recognition rate).&lt;ref name="[Back2]"/&gt;

[[File:Printer AccousticEmanation.png|thumb|center|988px|alt=|Diagram presenting phases when retrieving data from a printer]]

== Computer components ==

=== Network Interface Card ===

==== Timing attack ====
Timing attacks enable an attacker to extract secrets maintained in a security system by observing the time it takes the system to respond to various queries.&lt;ref name="[Brum1p1]"&gt;[[#Brum1|Brumley, 2003, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Secure Shell|SSH]] is designed to provide a secure channel between two hosts. Despite the encryption and authentication mechanisms it uses, SSH has weaknesses. In interactive mode, every individual keystroke that a user types is sent to the remote machine in a separate IP packet immediately after the key is pressed, which leaks the inter-keystroke timing information of users’ typing. Below, the picture represents the command ''su'' processed through a SSH connection.
[[File:Ssh timingattack.png|500px|thumb|center||alt=|Network messages sent between the host and the client for the command 'su' – numbers are size of network packet in byte]]

A very simple statistical techniques suffice to reveal sensitive information such as the length of users’ passwords or even root passwords. By using advanced statistical techniques on timing information collected from the network, the eavesdropper can learn significant information about what users type in SSH sessions.&lt;ref name="[Song1p1]"&gt;[[#Song1|Song, 2001, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Because the time it takes the operating system to send out the packet after the keypress is in general negligible comparing to the interkeystroke timing, this also enables an eavesdropper to learn the precise interkeystroke timings of users’ typing from the arrival times of packets.&lt;ref name="[Song1p2]"&gt;[[#Song1|Song, 2001, p.2]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memory ===

==== Physical chemistry ====
Data remanence problems not only affect obvious areas such as RAM and non-volatile memory cells but can also occur in other areas of the device through hot-carrier effects (which change the characteristics of the semiconductors in the device) and various other effects which are examined alongside the more obvious memory-cell remanence problems.&lt;ref name="Gut1"&gt;[[#Gut1|Gutmann, 2001, p. 1]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is possible to analyse and recover data from these cells and from semiconductor devices in general long after it should (in theory) have vanished.&lt;ref name="Gut2"&gt;[[#Gut1|Gutmann, 2001, p. 4]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Electromigration, which means to physically move the atom to new locations (to physically alter the device itself) is another type of attack.&lt;ref name="Gut1" /&gt; It involves the relocation of metal atoms due to high current densities, a phenomenon in which atoms are carried along by an "electron wind" in the opposite direction to the conventional current, producing voids at the negative electrode and hillocks and whiskers at the positive electrode. Void formation leads to a local increase in current density and Joule heating (the interaction of electrons and metal ions to produce thermal energy), producing further electromigration effects. When the external stress is removed, the disturbed system tends to relax back to its original equilibrium state, resulting in a backflow which heals some of the electromigration damage. In the long term though, this can cause device failure, but in less extreme cases it simply serves to alter a device’s operating characteristics in noticeable ways.

For example, the excavations of voids leads to increased wiring resistance and the growth of whiskers leads to contact formation and current leakage.&lt;ref name="Gut10"&gt;[[#Gut1|Gutmann, 2001, p.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a conductor which exhibits whisker growth due to electromigration is shown in the figure below:

[[File:Whisker growth.jpg|thumb|center|969px|alt=|Whisker growth due to electromigration]]

One example which exhibits void formation (in this case severe enough to have led to complete failure) is shown in this figure:

[[File:Void formation.jpg|thumb|center|969px|alt=|Void formation due to electromigration]]

==== Temperature ====
Contrary to popular assumption, DRAMs used in most modern computers retain their contents for several seconds after power is lost, even at room temperature and even if removed from a motherboard.&lt;ref name="Hald1p1"&gt;[[#Hald1|Halderman, 2008, p1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many products do cryptographic and other security-related computations using secret keys or other variables that the equipment’s operator must not be able to read out or alter. The usual solution is for the secret data to be kept in volatile memory inside a tamper-sensing enclosure. Security processors typically store secret key material in static RAM, from which power is removed if the device is tampered with. At temperatures below −20&amp;nbsp;°C, the contents of SRAM can be ‘frozen’. It is interesting to know the period of time for which a static RAM device will retain data once the power has been removed. Low temperatures can increase the data retention time of SRAM to many seconds or even minutes.&lt;ref name="Sko1p3"&gt;[[#Sko1|Skorobogatov, 2002, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Read/Write exploits thanks to FireWire ====
Maximillian Dornseif presented a technique in [[#Dorn1|these slides]], which let him take the control of an Apple computer thanks to an iPod. The attacks needed a first generic phase where the iPod software was modified so that it behaves as master on the FireWire bus. Then the iPod had full read/write access on the Apple Computer when the iPod was plugged into a FireWire port.&lt;ref name="Dorn1"&gt;[[#Dorn1|Dornseif, 2004]]&lt;/ref&gt; FireWire is used by : audio devices, printers, scanners, cameras, gps, etc. Generally, a device connected by FireWire has full access (read/write). Indeed, OHCI Standard (FireWire standard) reads :
{{cquote|Physical requests, including physical read, physical write and lock requests to some CSR registers (section 5.5), are handled directly by the Host Controller without assistance by system software.
|4=OHCI Standard}}

So, any device connected by FireWire can read and write data on the computer memory. For example, a device can :
* Grab the screen contents ;
* Just search the memory for strings such as login, passwords ;
* Scan for possible key material ;
* Search cryptographic keys stored in RAM ;
* Parse the whole physical memory to understand logical memory layout.
or
* Mess up the memory ;
* Change screen content ;
* Change UID/GID of a certain process ;
* Inject code into a process ;
* Inject an additional process.

=== Processor ===

==== Cache attack ====
To increase the computational power, processors are generally equipped with a [[CPU cache|cache memory]] which decreases the memory access latency. Below, the figure shows the hierarchy between the processor and the memory. First the processor looks for data in the cache L1, then L2, then in the memory.
[[File:Mem cache.jpg|500px|thumb|center||alt=|Processor cache hierarchy]]

When the data is not where the processor is looking for, it is called a cache-miss. Below, pictures show how the processor fetch data when there are two cache levels.
{|
| [[File:Processor cacheL1.png|300px|thumb|Data A is in the L1-Cache]]
| [[File:Processor cacheL2.png|300px|thumb|Data A is in the L2-Cache]]
| [[File:Processor cacheM.png|300px|thumb|Data A is in the memory]]
|}

Unfortunately caches contain only a small portion of the application data and can introduce additional latency to the memory transaction in the case of a miss. This involves also additional power consumption which is due to the activation of memory devices down in the memory hierarchy. The miss penalty has been already used to attack symmetric encryption algorithms, like DES.&lt;ref name="Bert1p1"&gt;[[#Bert1|Bertoni, 2005, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; The basic idea proposed in this paper is to force a cache miss while the processor is executing the AES encryption algorithm on a known plain text.&lt;ref name="Bert1p3"&gt;[[#Bert1|Bertoni, 2005, p.3]]&lt;/ref&gt; The attacks allow an unprivileged process to attack other process running in parallel on the same processor, despite partitioning methods such as memory protection, sandboxing and virtualization.&lt;ref name="sha1p1"&gt;[[#Sha1|Shamir, 2005, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Timing attack ====
By carefully measuring the amount of time required to perform private key operations, attackers may be able to find fixed [[Diffie–Hellman key exchange|Diffie-Hellman exponents]], factor [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] keys, and break other cryptosystems. Against a vulnerable system, the attack is computationally inexpensive and often requires only known ciphertext.&lt;ref name="[Koch1p1]"&gt;[[#Koch1|Kocher, 1996, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt;
The attack can be treated as a signal detection problem. The signal consists of the timing variation due to the target exponent bit, and noise results from measurement inaccuracies and timing variations due to unknown exponent bits. The properties of the signal and noise determine the number of timing measurements required to for the attack. Timing attacks can potentially be used against other cryptosystems, including symmetric functions.&lt;ref name="[Koch1p9]"&gt;[[#Koch1|Kocher, 1996, p.9]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Privilege escalation ====
{{See also|Hardware backdoor}}
A simple and generic processor backdoor can be used by attackers as a means to privilege escalation to get to privileges equivalent to those of any given running operating system.&lt;ref name="Dufl21"&gt;[[#Dufl2|Duflot, 2008, p.1]]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a non-privileged process of one of the non-privileged invited domain running on top of a virtual machine monitor can get to privileges equivalent to those of the virtual machine monitor.&lt;ref name="Dufl21"/&gt;

Loïc Duflot studied Intel processors in the paper "[[#Dufl2|CPU bugs, CPU backdoors and consequences on security]]" ; he explains that the processor defines four different privilege rings numbered from 0 (most privileged) to 3 (least privileged). Kernel code is usually running in ring 0, whereas user-space code is generally running in ring 3. The use of some security-critical assembly language instructions is restricted to ring 0 code. In order to escalate privilege through the backdoor, the attacker must :&lt;ref name="Dufl22"&gt;[[#Dufl2|Duflot, 2008, p.5]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# activate the backdoor by placing the CPU in the desired state ;
# inject code and run it in ring 0 ;
# get back to ring 3 in order to return the system to a stable state. Indeed, when code is running in ring 0, system calls do not work : Leaving the system in ring 0 and running a random system call (exit() typically) is likely to crash the system.
The backdoors Loïc Duflot presents are simple as they only modify the behavior of three assembly language instructions and have very simple and specific activation conditions, so that they are very unlikely to be accidentally activated. [[#Waks1|Recent inventions]] have begun to target these types of processor-based escalation attacks.

'''Connectionism''' is an approach in the fields of [[cognitive science]], that hopes to explain [[mind|mental]] phenomena using [[artificial neural networks]] (ANN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2018/entries/connectionism/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=James|last=Garson|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=27 November 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Artificial_neural_network.svg|thumb|Connectionist (ANN) model with a hidden layer]]

==Basic principles==
The central connectionist principle is that mental phenomena can be described by interconnected networks of simple and often uniform units. The form of the connections and the units can vary from model to model. For example, units in the network could represent [[neurons]] and the connections could represent [[synapses]], as in the [[human brain]].

===Spreading activation===
{{Main|Spreading activation}}
In most connectionist models, networks change over time.  A closely related and very common aspect of connectionist models is ''activation''. At any time, a unit in the network has an activation, which is a numerical value intended to represent some aspect of the unit.  For example, if the units in the model are neurons, the activation could represent the [[probability]] that the neuron would generate an [[action potential]] spike. Activation typically spreads to all the other units connected to it.  Spreading activation is always a feature of neural network models, and it is very common in connectionist models used by [[cognitive psychology|cognitive psychologists]].

===Neural networks===
{{Main|Artificial neural networks}}
Neural networks are by far the most commonly used connectionist model today. Though there are a large variety of neural network models, they almost always follow two basic principles regarding the mind:

# Any mental state can be described as an (N)-dimensional [[Vector (mathematics)|vector]] of numeric activation values over neural units in a network.
# Memory is created by modifying the strength of the connections between neural units. The connection strengths, or "weights", are generally represented as an N×N [[Matrix (mathematics)|matrix]].

Most of the variety among neural network models comes from:
* ''Interpretation of units'': Units can be interpreted as neurons or groups of neurons.
* ''Definition of activation'': Activation can be defined in a variety of ways. For example, in a [[Boltzmann machine]], the activation is interpreted as the [[probability]] of generating an action potential spike, and is determined via a [[logistic function]] on the sum of the inputs to a unit.
* ''Learning algorithm'': Different networks modify their connections differently. In general, any mathematically defined change in connection weights over time is referred to as the "learning algorithm".

Connectionists are in agreement that [[recurrent neural networks]] (directed networks wherein connections of the network can form a directed cycle) are a better model of the brain than [[feedforward neural networks]] (directed networks with no cycles, called [[Directed acyclic graph|DAG]]). Many recurrent connectionist models also incorporate [[dynamical systems theory]]. Many researchers, such as the connectionist [[Paul Smolensky]], have argued that connectionist models will evolve toward fully [[Continuous function|continuous]], high-dimensional, [[non-linear]], [[dynamic systems]] approaches.

===Biological realism===
Connectionist work in general does not need to be biologically realistic and therefore suffers from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317958765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Learning===
The weights in a neural network are adjusted according to some [[learning rule]] or algorithm, such as [[Hebbian theory|Hebbian learning]]. Thus, connectionists have created many sophisticated learning procedures for neural networks. Learning always involves modifying the connection weights. In general, these involve mathematical formulas to determine the change in weights when given sets of data consisting of activation vectors for some subset of the neural units. Several studies have been focused on designing teaching-learning methods based on connectionism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Novo|first=María-Luisa|last2=Alsina|first2=Ángel|last3=Marbán|first3=José-María|last4=Berciano|first4=Ainhoa|date=2017|title=Connective Intelligence for Childhood Mathematics Education|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-03|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=29–39|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-03|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By formalizing learning in such a way, connectionists have many tools. A very common strategy in connectionist learning methods is to incorporate [[gradient descent]] over an error surface in a space defined by the weight matrix. All gradient descent learning in connectionist models involves changing each weight by the [[partial derivative]] of the error surface with respect to the weight. [[Backpropagation]] (BP), first made popular in the 1980s, is probably the most commonly known connectionist gradient descent algorithm today.

==History==

Connectionism can be traced to ideas more than a century old, which were little more than speculation until the mid-to-late 20th century.

===Parallel distributed processing===

The prevailing connectionist approach today was originally known as '''parallel distributed processing''' (PDP). It was an [[artificial neural network]] approach that stressed the parallel nature of neural processing, and the distributed nature of neural representations.  It provided a general mathematical framework for researchers to operate in. The framework involved eight major aspects:

* A set of ''processing units'', represented by a [[set (computer science)|set]] of integers.
* An ''activation'' for each unit, represented by a vector of time-dependent [[Function (mathematics)|functions]].
* An ''output function'' for each unit, represented by a vector of functions on the activations.
* A ''pattern of connectivity'' among units, represented by a matrix of real numbers indicating connection strength.
* A ''propagation rule'' spreading the activations via the connections, represented by a function on the output of the units.
* An ''activation rule'' for combining inputs to a unit to determine its new activation, represented by a function on the current activation and propagation.
* A ''[[learning rule]]'' for modifying connections based on experience, represented by a change in the weights based on any number of variables.
* An ''environment'' that provides the system with experience, represented by sets of activation vectors for some [[subset]] of the units.

A lot of the research that led to the development of PDP was done in the 1970s, but PDP became popular in the 1980s with the release of the books ''Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition - Volume 1 (foundations)'' and ''Volume 2 (Psychological and Biological Models)'', by [[James L. McClelland]], [[David E. Rumelhart]] and the PDP Research Group. The books are now considered seminal connectionist works, and it is now common to fully equate PDP and connectionism, although the term "connectionism" is not used in the books.

===Earlier work===
PDP's direct roots were the [[perceptron]] theories of researchers such as [[Frank Rosenblatt]] from the 1950s and 1960s. But perceptron models were made very unpopular by the book ''Perceptrons'' by [[Marvin Minsky]] and [[Seymour Papert]], published in 1969. It demonstrated the limits on the sorts of functions that single-layered (no hidden layer) perceptrons can calculate, showing that even simple functions like the [[exclusive disjunction]] (XOR) could not be handled properly. The PDP books overcame this limitation by showing that multi-level, non-linear neural networks were far more robust and could be used for a vast array of functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/0893-6080(89)90020-8| title = Multilayer feedforward networks are universal approximators| journal = Neural Networks| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 359| year = 1989| last1 = Hornik | first1 = K. | last2 = Stinchcombe | first2 = M. | last3 = White | first3 = H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many earlier researchers advocated connectionist style models, for example in the 1940s and 1950s, [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]] ([[Artificial neuron|MP neuron]]), [[Donald Olding Hebb]], and [[Karl Lashley]]. McCulloch and Pitts showed how neural systems could implement [[first-order logic]]: Their classic paper "A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity" (1943) is important in this development here. They were influenced by the important work of [[Nicolas Rashevsky]] in the 1930s.  Hebb contributed greatly to speculations about neural functioning, and proposed a learning principle, [[Hebbian learning]], that is still used today. Lashley argued for distributed representations as a result of his failure to find anything like a localized [[Engram (neuropsychology)|engram]] in years of [[lesion]] experiments.

===Connectionism apart from PDP===
Though PDP is the dominant form of connectionism, other theoretical work should also be classified as connectionist.

Many connectionist principles can be traced to early work in [[psychology]], such as that of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Anderson  |first1= James A.|last2=Rosenfeld |first2= Edward |date= 1989|title= Neurocomputing: Foundations of Research|url= |location= |publisher= A Bradford Book |page= 1|chapter = Chapter 1: (1890) William James ''Psychology (Brief Course)'' |isbn=978-0262510486 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological theories based on knowledge about the human brain were fashionable in the late 19th century.  As early as 1869, the neurologist [[John Hughlings Jackson]] argued for multi-level, distributed systems. Following from this lead, [[Herbert Spencer]]'s ''Principles of Psychology'', 3rd edition (1872), and [[Sigmund Freud]]'s ''Project for a Scientific Psychology'' (composed 1895) propounded connectionist or proto-connectionist theories. These tended to be speculative theories. But by the early 20th century, [[Edward Thorndike]] was experimenting on learning that posited a connectionist type network.

In the 1950s, [[Friedrich Hayek]] proposed that spontaneous order in the brain arose out of decentralized networks of simple units{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}. Hayek's work was rarely cited in the PDP literature until recently{{Citation needed|date=March 2015}}.

Another form of connectionist model was the [[Stratificational linguistics|relational network]] framework developed by the [[linguist]] [[Sydney Lamb]] in the 1960s. Relational networks have been only used by linguists, and were never unified with the PDP approach. As a result, they are now used by very few researchers.

There are also hybrid connectionist models, mostly mixing symbolic representations with neural network models.
The hybrid approach has been advocated by some researchers (such as [[Ron Sun]]).

==Connectionism vs. computationalism debate==
As connectionism became increasingly popular in the late 1980s, some researchers (including [[Jerry Fodor]], [[Steven Pinker]] and others) reacted against it.  They argued that connectionism, as then developing, threatened to obliterate what they saw as the progress being made in the fields of cognitive science and psychology by the classical approach of [[computationalism]]. Computationalism is a specific form of cognitivism that argues that mental activity is [[Computing|computational]], that is, that the mind operates by performing purely formal operations on symbols, like a [[Turing machine]].  Some researchers argued that the trend in connectionism represented a reversion toward [[associationism]] and the abandonment of the idea of a [[language of thought]], something they saw as mistaken. In contrast, those very tendencies made connectionism attractive for other researchers.

Connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds, but the debate in the late 1980s and early 1990s led to opposition between the two approaches.  Throughout the debate, some researchers have argued that connectionism and computationalism are fully compatible, though full consensus on this issue has not been reached.  Differences between the two approaches include the following:

* Computationalists posit symbolic models that are structurally similar to underlying brain structure, whereas connectionists engage in "low-level" modeling, trying to ensure that their models resemble neurological structures.
* Computationalists in general focus on the structure of explicit symbols ([[mental models]]) and [[syntactical]] rules for their internal manipulation, whereas connectionists focus on learning from environmental stimuli and storing this information in a form of connections between neurons.
* Computationalists believe that internal mental activity consists of manipulation of explicit symbols, whereas connectionists believe that the manipulation of explicit symbols provides a poor model of mental activity.
* Computationalists often posit [[domain specificity|domain specific]] symbolic sub-systems designed to support learning in specific areas of cognition (e.g., language, intentionality, number), whereas connectionists posit one or a small set of very general learning-mechanisms.

Despite these differences, some theorists have proposed that the connectionist architecture is simply the manner in which organic brains happen to implement the symbol-manipulation system. This is logically possible, as it is well known that connectionist models can implement symbol-manipulation systems of the kind used in computationalist models,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} as indeed they must be able if they are to explain the human ability to perform symbol-manipulation tasks. But the debate rests on whether this symbol manipulation forms the foundation of cognition in general, so this is not a potential vindication of computationalism. Nonetheless, computational descriptions may be helpful high-level descriptions of cognition of logic, for example.

The debate largely centred on logical arguments about whether connectionist networks could produce the syntactic structure observed in this sort of reasoning. This was later achieved,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} although using processes unlikely to be possible in the brain,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} thus the debate persisted. {{As of | 2016}}, progress in neurophysiology and general advances in the understanding of neural networks have led to the successful modelling of a great many of these early problems, and the debate about fundamental cognition has, thus, largely been decided among neuroscientists in favour of connectionism.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}} However, these fairly recent developments have yet to reach consensus acceptance among those working in other fields, such as psychology or philosophy of mind.

Part of the appeal of computational descriptions is that they are relatively easy to interpret, and thus may be seen as contributing to our understanding of particular mental processes, whereas connectionist models are in general more opaque, to the extent that they may be describable only in very general terms (such as specifying the learning algorithm, the number of units, etc.), or in unhelpfully low-level terms. In this sense connectionist models may instantiate, and thereby provide evidence for, a broad theory of cognition (i.e., connectionism), without representing a helpful theory of the particular process that is being modelled. In this sense the debate might be considered as to some extent reflecting a mere difference in the level of analysis in which particular theories are framed.

The recent{{when|date=February 2016}} popularity of [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] in [[philosophy of mind]] have added a new perspective on the debate; some authors{{which|date=February 2016}} now argue that any split between connectionism and computationalism is more conclusively characterized as a split between computationalism and [[Cognitive Model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]].

In 2014, [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] and others from [[DeepMind]] published a series of papers describing a novel Deep Neural Network structure called the [[Neural Turing Machine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|title=Neural Turing Machines|arxiv=1410.5401}}&lt;/ref&gt; able to read symbols on a tape and store symbols in memory. Relational Networks, another Deep Network module published by DeepMind are able to create object-like representations and manipulate them to answer complex questions. Relational Networks and Neural Turing Machines are further evidence that connectionism and computationalism need not be at odds.

{{Music Education|major}}
'''Dalcroze eurhythmics''', also known as the '''Dalcroze method''' or simply '''eurhythmics''', is one of several developmental approaches including the [[Kodály method]], [[Orff Schulwerk]] and [[Suzuki Method]] used to [[music education|teach music]] to students. Eurhythmics was developed in the early 20th century by [[Swiss]] musician and educator [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]]. Dalcroze eurhythmics teaches concepts of rhythm, structure, and musical expression using movement, and is the concept for which Dalcroze is best known. It focuses on allowing the student to gain physical awareness and experience of music through training that takes place through all of the senses, particularly kinesthetic.

Eurhythmics often introduces a musical concept through movement before the students learn about its visual representation. This sequence translates to heightened body awareness and an association of rhythm with a physical experience for the student, reinforcing concepts kinesthetically. Eurhythmics has wide-ranging applications and benefits and can be taught to a variety of age groups. Eurhythmics classes for all ages share a common goal – to provide the music student with a solid rhythmic foundation through movement in order to enhance musical expression and understanding. The origin of the word "Eurhythmics" is "[[eurythmy]]" + "-ics".

==Émile Jaques-Dalcroze and the origins of eurhythmics==

Jaques-Dalcroze was appointed Professor of Harmony at the Conservatoire of Geneva in 1892, early in his career. As he taught his classes, he noticed that his students deeply needed an approach to learning music that included a kinesthetic component. He believed that in order to enhance and maximize musical expression, students needed to be trained early on to listen and appreciate music using both their minds and bodies. This coordination of mind and physical instincts formed the basis of his method.

Ready to develop and employ an improved, integrated style of music education at the Conservatoire, Dalcroze discovered some obstacles. He found that students with innate rhythmic abilities were rare, just as those with "perfect," or absolute pitch are. In response to his observations, he asserted that in order to develop rhythmic ability in his students, he must first, and as early as possible in their development, train them in exercises that utilized the entire body. Only when the student's muscles and motor skills were developed could they be properly equipped to interpret and understand musical ideas. As he mentioned in the foreword of his "Rhythm, Music, and Education," he sought the "connection between instincts for pitch and movement…time and energy, dynamics, and space, music and character, music and temperament, [and] finally the art of music and the art of dancing.”

Because of the nature of his goals in expanding music education, his ideas are readily applicable to young students. An objective of his was to "musicalize" young children in order to prepare them for musical expression in future instrumental studies. He believed exposure to music, an expanded understanding of how to listen, and the training of gross and fine motor skills would yield faster progress later on in students’ musical studies. Related to this was his goal to sow the seeds of musical appreciation for future generations.

As stated concisely by Claire-Lise Dutoit in her "Music Movement Therapy," successful eurhythmics lessons have the following three attributes in common:

“The vital enjoyment of rhythmic movement and the confidence that it gives; the ability to hear, understand and express music in movement; [and] the call made on the pupil to improvise and develop freely his own ideas.”

==Influences on the development of eurhythmics==

Before taking a post teaching theory, [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]] spent a year as a conductor in Algiers, where he was exposed to a rhythmic complexity that helped influence him to pay special attention to rhythmic aspects of music.

Jaques-Dalcroze also had an important friendship with [[Édouard Claparède]], the renowned psychologist. In particular, their collaboration resulted in eurhythmics often employing games of change and quick reaction in order to focus attention and increase learning.

==Current applications==

'''General Education'''

Eurhythmics classes are often offered as an addition to general education programs, whether in preschools, grade schools, or secondary schools. In this setting, the objectives of eurhythmics classes are to introduce students with a variety of musical backgrounds to musical concepts through movement without a specific performance-related goal.

For younger students, eurhythmics activities often imitate play. Games include musical storytelling, which associates different types of music with corresponding movements of the characters in a story. The youngest of students, who are typically experiencing their first exposure to musical knowledge in a eurhythmics class, learn to correlate types of notes with familiar movement; for example the quarter note is represented as a "walking note." As they progress, their musical vocabulary is expanded and reinforced through movement.

'''Performance-Based Applications'''

While eurhythmics classes can be taught to general populations of students, they are also effective when geared toward music schools, either preparing students to begin instrumental studies or serving as a supplement to students who have already begun musical performance.

==Aspects of a rhythmic curriculum==

'''Vocabulary'''

Eurhythmics classes for students in elementary school through college and beyond can benefit from a rhythmic curriculum that explores rhythmic vocabulary. This vocabulary can be introduced and utilized in a number of different ways, but the primary objective of this component is to familiarize students with rhythmic possibilities and expand their horizons. Activities such as rhythmic dictation, composition, and the performance of rhythmic canons and polyrhythms can accommodate a wide range of meters and vocabulary. In particular, vocabulary can be organized according to number of subdivisions of the pulse.

'''Movement'''

A key component of a rhythmic education, movement provides another way of reinforcing rhythmic concepts - kinesthetic learning serves as a supplement to visual and aural learning. While the study of traditional classroom music theory reinforces concepts visually and encourages students to develop aural skills, the study of eurhythmics solidifies these concepts through movement. In younger students, the movement aspect of a rhythmic curriculum also develops musculature and gross motor skills. Ideally, most activities that are explored in eurhythmics classes should include some sort of kinesthetic reinforcement.

'''Meter and Syncopation'''

Another element of a rhythmic curriculum is the exploration of meter and syncopation. In particular, the study of meter should incorporate an organization of pulses and subdivisions. This organization can be expressed in a "meter chart," which can include both equal-beat and unequal-beat meters.

The study of syncopation, a broad term that can involve a variety of rhythms that fall unexpectedly or somehow displace the pulse, is also essential in a rhythmic education. Eurhythmics classes can incorporate various activities to explore syncopation, including complex rhythmic dictations, the performance of syncopated rhythms, the exploration of syncopated rhythms in canon, and a general discussion of syncopated vocabulary.

==Sample activities==

Ages 3–6:
* Warm-up activities: The students isolate and shake each body part, each one accompanied by different music. 
* Notes: Students learn about musical notation through associated movements. For example, quarter notes would be taught as “walking notes”. After familiarity with associated movements, note names are then introduced.
* Storytelling: The teacher invents a story or uses a familiar storyline to incorporate rhythmic concepts
* Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills
* Games with sticks: The students jump across a series of sticks on the floor, learning to coordinate body parts and their associated rhythm.
* Drum activities: The students participate with small drums, getting to reproduce rhythm in an instrumental context

Ages 7+ (activities can be adapted to different age groups) 
* Swings: The teacher plays music improvised in a preset metrical pattern. The students use prescribed body motions to determine the pattern.
* Rhythmic dictation: The teacher plays a number of measures of music repeatedly, the rhythm of which the students dictate.
* Rhythms: Students clap or step a predetermined rhythmic pattern. The teacher can experiment with augmentation and diminution.
* Small group activities: Students work together in small groups to accomplish rhythmic tasks, encouraging cooperation. 
* Ball games: Students pass a ball around in different ways, exploring naturally occurring rhythm and developing motor skills.
* Tempos: Students work to discover different tempos that can be applied to classical repertoire, familiar songs, or everyday movements. The teacher can also lead in experimenting with tempo relationships and adjustment.
* Polyrhythms: The teacher establishes two rhythms to be performed at once, one in the hands and one in the feet.
* Cross rhythms:  Students produce one even rhythm in the hands against another even rhythm in the feet. The teacher prompts them to switch which rhythm is produced in each body part.
* “Cosmic Whole Note”: Students listen to a slow pulse (an example would be 6 beats per minute), subdivide the space between sounds, and predict when the next pulse sounds by clapping.
* Canon: Students listen to rhythmic vocabulary performed by the teacher and step this vocabulary in canon. This activity can be executed in a variety of meters. 
* “Microbeats”: Students learn syllables to represent 1-9 subdivisions of a beat. Associated activities could include performing microbeats in prescribed patterns, at varying tempi, in canon, or as sight-reading.

==Effectiveness of Dalcroze eurhythmics==
A group of 72 pre-school children were tested on their rhythmic ability; half of the children had free-play (35–40 min.) twice a week for a 10-week period while the other half had rhythmic movement classes for the same amount of time. The group that had classes (experimental group) did significantly better than the group that just had free-play (control group). The experiment group scored four or more points better in every area tested than the control group in the final test. This shows that eurhythmic classes can benefit a child’s sense of rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Zachopoulou, Evridiki, Vassiliki Drri, Dimitris Chatzopoulou, Theordoros Elinoudis.

Generally, a direct repeat occurs when a sequence is repeated with the same pattern downstream.&lt;ref name=Ussery2008 /&gt;  There is no inversion and no reverse complement associated with a direct repeat. It may or may not have intervening nucleotides. The nucleotide sequence written in bold characters signifies the repeated sequence.

==Types==
There are several types of repeated sequences :
*Interspersed (or dispersed) DNA repeats (interspersed repetitive sequences) are copies of [[transposable elements]] interspersed throughout the genome. 
*Flanking (or terminal) repeats (terminal repeat sequences) are sequences that are repeated on both ends of a sequence, for example, the [[long terminal repeat]]s (LTRs) on [[retroviruses]]. Direct terminal repeats are in the same direction and inverted terminal repeats are opposite to each other in direction. 
*[[Tandem repeats]] (tandem repeat sequences) are repeated copies which lie adjacent to each other. These can also be direct or [[inverted repeats]]. The [[ribosomal RNA]] and [[transfer RNA]] genes belong to the class of middle repetitive DNA.

This event decimated amphibian populations and spurred on the evolution of reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

[[Climate change]] is a natural event that has occurred throughout history. However, with the recent increased emission of [[CO2|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] in the Earth's atmosphere, [[abrupt climate change]] has occurred. It has been hypothesized that [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] [[greenhouse gas]] forcing has significantly influenced global climate since about 8000 [[before present]] (Van Hoof 2006).

Animals have had specific responses to climate change. [[Species]] respond to climate changes by migration, adaptation, or if neither of those occur, death. These migrations can sometimes follow an animal's preferred temperature, elevation, soil, etc., as said terrain moves due to climate change. Adaptation can be either genetic or [[phenological]], and death can occur in a local population only ([[Local extinction|extirpation]]) or as an entire species, otherwise known as [[extinction]].

Climate changes is projected to affect individual organisms, populations, species distributions and ecosystem composition and function both directly (ex. Increased temperatures and changes in precipitation) and indirectly (through climate changing the intensity and frequency of disturbances such as [[wildfire]]s and severe storms)(IPCC 2002).

Every organism has a unique set of preferences or requirements, a [[Ecological niche|niche]] and [[biodiversity]] has been tied to the diversity of animals' niches.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/6/4/544.full.pdf+html | author=Sahney, S.,  Benton, M.J. and Ferry, P.A. | year=2010 | title=Links between global taxonomic diversity, ecological diversity and the expansion of vertebrates on land | journal=Biology Letters | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.1024 | volume = 6 | pages = 544–547 |format=PDF | issue=4 | pmid=20106856 | pmc=2936204}}&lt;/ref&gt; These can include or be affected by temperature, aridity, resource availability, habitat requirements, enemies, soil characteristics, competitors, and pollinators. Since the factors that compose a niche can be so complex and interconnected, the niches of many animals are bound to be affected by climate change (Parmesan Yohe 2003).

One study done by Camille Parmesan and [[Gary Yohe]] from University of Texas, Austin shows the global fingerprint of climate change on natural systems. The results of their global analysis of 334 species were recorded to demonstrate the correlation of patterns consistent with global climate change of the 20th century. Using the IPCC's ([[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]) ‘levels of confidence’, this study proved significant nonrandom behavioral changes due to global climate change with very high confidence (&gt;95).  Furthermore, an accuracy of 74-91% change in species has displayed predicted change for species in response to climate change.

==Direct impact==

===Habitat fragmentation===
During the [[Carboniferous Rainforest Collapse]], the vast and lush rainforests of Euramerica were destroyed, fragmenting into small 'islands' in a much less diverse landscape. This event decimated amphibian populations and spurred on the evolution of reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFalconLang 2010RainforestCollapse"/&gt;

===Increased temperatures===
“Average Temperature changes do not in themselves provide simple predictions about ecological consequences. Average temperatures have changed more in high latitudes than in the tropics, but tropic species are likely more sensitive to temperature changes than temperate ones (IPCC 2008).”
[[Q10 (temperature coefficient)|Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]] is the rate of change of a biological or chemical system as a consequence of increasing the temperature by 10&amp;nbsp;°C.

===Phenology===
[[Phenology]] is the study of life cycles of animals or plants due to seasonal or other variable climate changes. These responses by animals due to climate change may or may not be genetic{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Researchers are exploring ways to breed livestock like chickens, turkeys, and pigs to better withstand the heat.&lt;ref name="Robertson"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalgeographic.com/climate-change/how-to-live-with-it/heat.html|title=Crop Changes National Geographic|last=Robertson|first=Ricky|work=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|accessdate=3 March 2016| location="Madison"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration==

===Range shifts===
Range shifts are a natural response to climate change. Species with sufficient levels of mobility may respond quickly to environmental change, with species capable of undertaking long migratory movements likely to shift ranges first (Lundy ''et al.,'' 2010). Migration is not limited to animal populations - plants can migrate via [[Biological dispersal|passive seed dispersal]], establishing new individuals where conditions allow.

“The range of plants and animals are moving in response to recent changes in climate (Loarie 2009).” As Temperature increases, ecosystems are particularly threatened when their [[Ecological niche|niche]] has, essentially no where else to move to. This hindrance is particularly prevalent in mountain ranges for example. The speed at which climate is changing is derived from ratio of temporal and spatial gradients of mean annual near-surface temperature.

“Mountainous [[biomes]] require the slowest velocities to keep pace with climate change. In contrast, flatter biomes, such as flooded grasslands, mangroves and deserts require much greater velocities. Overall, there is a strong correlation between topographic slope and velocity from temperature change (Loarie 2009).”

Temperatures are expected to rise more than average in higher latitudes and at higher elevations. Animals living at lower elevations could migrate to higher elevations in response to climate change as temperatures rises. Whereas animals in higher elevations will eventually ‘run out of mountain’. “Results confirmed that protected large-scale elevation gradients retain diversity by allowing species to migrate in response to climate and vegetation change. The long-recognized importance of protecting landscapes has never been greater"(Moritz 2008).

Over the past 40 years, species have been extending their ranges toward the poles and populations have been migrating, developing, or reproducing earlier in the spring than previously (Huntley 2007).

==Adaptation==
The 2007, IPCC's report stated that “adaptation will be necessary to address impacts resulting from the warming which is already unavoidable due to past emissions.” (IPCC 2007)

===Changes in phenology===
As mentioned earlier, phenology is the changing of an animal’s behavior due to climatic circumstances. It may or may not be genetic. The genetic changes in animal populations have involved adaptation to the timing of seasonal events or to season length. For example, the Canadian red squirrels are reproducing earlier in the spring, thereby capitalizing on earlier spruce cone production (Huntley 2007).

Because of the increasing evidence that humans have had a significant impact on global climate over the previous centuries, many scientists wonder how species—and the ecosystems they live in—will adapt to these changes, or if they even can.

Usually the first and most easily detectable response is a change in the species’ phenotype, or its physical features. But there is a debate among scientists over whether or not these changes reflect an adaptive genetic evolution or simply [[phenotypic plasticity]].

A recently published study by Franks ''et al.'' sought to demonstrate that a shift in the annual flowering time of the Bassica Rapa plant in response to a multi-annual drought is southern California is in fact an adaptive evolutionary response. Based on the study, they concluded that post-drought genotypes appeared to be better adapted to shorter growing seasons than the pre-drought [[genotypes]], and that this was a result of adaptive evolution.

Huntley  counters the findings of Franks ''et al.'' (Huntley 2007) with a study by Wu, ''et al.'' (Wu L 1975) which provided evidence that not only different species but also different populations of the same species exhibited markedly different potentials for the selection of heavy metal tolerant genotypes.  This lead Bradshaw and McNeilly to conclude that different populations of the same species can adapt their phenology to survive in the short term and at local sites, but genetic variation across an entire species in response to rapid climate change is not possible (Bradshaw 1991).

Huntley concludes that while some evolution is likely to occur in some species in relation to global climate change, it is unlikely to be sufficient to [[Mitigation of global warming|mitigate the effects]] of said changes, especially if they occur as rapidly as has happened in the past.

In refuting the findings of Franks, ''et al.'', Huntley concludes:
“Although the demonstration of an evolutionary basis for a phenotypic response may be interesting, it is insufficient to overturn the conclusions of Bradshaw and McNeilly (Bradshaw 1991). Evolutionary adaptation is unlikely to be of major importance in the response of species to the climatic changes expected this century. Furthermore, even its limited potential is likely to be severely reduced as a consequence of habitat and population fragmentation, and of the rapidity and magnitude of the expected climatic changes, that together are likely to lead to rapid genetic impoverishment of many populations. A more likely outcome is that, rather as in the grasslands developed on heavy metal contaminated soils, a small number of species that happen to have the necessary genetic variance will come to dominate many plant communities, with potentially far-reaching consequences for biodiversity, ecosystem function and the [[ecosystem services]] upon which mankind depends (Huntley 2007).”

There are many ways that an animal can alter its behavior. The timing of their Reproduction, Mating, and migration, or the changes in abundance-

===Evolutionary===
Adaptive shifts in the timing of seasonal events should precede adaptive shifts of thermal optima or increased heat tolerance over evolutionary time, and that is the pattern that is emerging (Bradshaw 1991).

It has been hypothesized that as temperature increases, body size would decrease. Smaller body size would dissipate heat more efficiently, so in an increased temperature environment one would expect an animal to be smaller. The opposite also holds true, when temperature decreases, studies have shown with great correlation that body size increases. This was shown.&lt;ref&gt;(Smith 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Climate change has been associated with changes in plant as well as animal size.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Climate+change+causing+reduction+in+sizes+of+animals+and+plants%3a...-a0269950318  Climate change causing reduction in sizes of animals and plants] 2011, The Daily Star&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors contributing to adaptation===
'''Short generational times''' as for many microbial disease organisms, small insects, common fisheries species and annual plants are thought to be highly more adaptive.

'''Wide dispersal areas''' allow animals to migrate and move to an environment better suitable in an effort to handle climate change.

'''Broad climatic tolerance''' is essentially the ability an animal has to withstand a large range of conditions. For example, the [[kangaroo]] has a very broad climatic tolerance.

'''Generalists''' are non-habitat species in that they are not restricted to a very specific location, environment, food source, etc. The American Coyote is an example of a generalist.

'''Opportunistic species''' feed and adapt to many changes.

===Factors hindering adaptation===
'''Long generation times''' limit the rate at which a species can become more varied.

'''Poorly dispersed animals''' are unable to migrate and essentially escape and survive the climate change.

'''Narrow climatic tolerance''' in animals inhibits animals to adapt because their basic survival needs cannot range in location, temperature or resources.

'''Population confined to one geographic location''' does not have a simple option of migration- such as animals that live in cold regions at the tops of low-lying mountains. These animals are in habitats that will run out as climate change increases and [[global warming]] becomes more impacted.

==Extinction or extirpation==
{{Main|Extinction risk from global warming}}

According to Stuart L. Pimm and his coauthors, human actions have raised species [[extinction]] or [[Local extinction|extirpation]] rates to three orders of magnitude above their [[Background extinction rate|natural, background rates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pimm | first1 = S.

A further 2150 species will be at risk of extinction" (Pimm 2009).

Given that species have limits to where they can exist, if conditions are unfavorable, mortality will be high and a species will be absent or rare in those areas. The corresponding graph representing this statement can be seen. The graph represents an experiment conducted using sand shrimp and their relative mortality rates based on salinity and temperature in a controlled environment. If climate change prompted the particular animal’s environment to become more or less salty, or too hot or too cold, and the organism was unable to move or to adapt, it would instead become extinct.

In Australia, the Grey-headed Robin is restricted to rainforests of the Wet Tropics region; and another population in the New Guinea highlands.
Although in some places it can be locally common, this bird's range is very restricted; it is found only in the north east of Queensland, and there only in the higher altitude rainforest. This is a projection of its range as climate change continues. This animal could be considered in danger of extinction.

A similar but more dramatic prediction is cast for the Lemuroid Ringtail Possum. As one can see, with a high enough temperature (climate) shift, this animal will become extinct.

Global warming as caused by humans is confirmed by the IPCC fourth Assessment to be “very likely”. This being the case, a tipping point may be reached for many species, leading ultimately to extinction (Pimm 2009).

Sometimes a species may react in one of the other two ways, by moving or by adapting, and yet find that its efforts do not save it from extinction. While not yet extinct, the Pied Flycatcher, a small insectivorous bird that migrates to Western Europe from Africa each spring, has declined to 10% of its former population. This has occurred at the same time as a main food source for the young flycatchers, caterpillars, have begun to peak much earlier. Although the birds have also begun to arrive earlier, they have not yet caught up to the peaking of the caterpillars. This individual species may or may not go extinct, but it goes to demonstrate that a species can sometimes begin to move or adapt and yet find itself dying nevertheless (Pimm 2009).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2459">In [[pragmatics]], '''exophora''' is reference to something extralinguistic, i.e. '''not in the same text''', and contrasts with [[endophora]].  Exophora can be [[deixis|deictic]], in which special words or grammatical markings are used to make reference to something in the context of the utterance or speaker.  For example, [[pronoun]]s are often exophoric, with words such as "this", "that", "here", "there", as in ''that chair over there is John's'' said while indicating the direction of the chair referred to.  Given "Did the gardener water those plants?", it is quite possible that "those" refers back to the preceding text, to some earlier mention of those particular plants in the discussion.  But it is also possible that it refers to the environment in which the dialogue is taking place&amp;mdash;to the "context of situation", as it is called&amp;mdash;where the plants in question are present and can be pointed to if necessary.  The interpretation would be "those plants there, in front of us".  This kind of reference is called exophora, since it takes us outside the text altogether.  Exophoric reference is not [[cohesion (linguistics)|cohesive]], since it does not bind the two elements together into a text.

==Homophora==
A type of exophora, homophora relates to a generic phrase that obtains a specific meaning through knowledge of its context; a specific example of homophora can variably be a "homophor" or a "homophoric reference".

For example, the meaning of the phrase ''"the Queen"'' may be determined by the country in which it is spoken. Because there are many Queens throughout the world, the location of the speaker provides the extra information that allows an individual Queen to be identified.

The precise origin of the term is not fully clear, but it is probably intended to suggest a [[referring expression]] that always has the same (Greek ''hómos'') referent (within a given cultural context, of course). "Homophoric" seems to have been first used in the influential book by M.A.K. Halliday and R. Hasan, ''Cohesion in English'' (Longman, 1976, pp. 71 and 73).

'''Frank Lloyd Wright''' (born '''Frank Lincoln Wright''', June 8, 1867 – April 9, 1959) was an American [[architect]], interior designer, writer, and educator, who designed more than 1,000 structures, 532 of which were completed. Wright believed in designing structures that were in harmony with humanity and its environment, a philosophy he called [[organic architecture]]. This philosophy was best exemplified by [[Fallingwater]] (1935), which has been called "the best all-time work of American architecture".&lt;ref name="Brewster" /&gt; His creative period spanned more than 70 years.

Wright was the pioneer of what came to be called the [[Prairie School]] movement of architecture, and he also developed the concept of the [[Usonia]]n home in [[Broadacre City]], his unique vision for urban planning in the United States.  In addition to his houses, Wright designed original and innovative offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, museums, and  other structures. He often designed interior elements for these buildings, as well, including furniture and [[stained glass]]. Wright wrote 20 books and many articles and was a popular lecturer in the United States and Europe. Wright was recognized in 1991 by the [[American Institute of Architects]] as "the greatest American architect of all time".&lt;ref name="Brewster" /&gt;

His colorful personal life often made headlines, notably for leaving his first wife, Catherine Lee "Kitty" Tobin for [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]], the murders at his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin estate]] in 1914, his tempestuous marriage with second wife Miriam Noel, and his relationship with [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]], who became his third wife in 1928.

==Early years==
===Ancestry===
Frank Lloyd Wright was born Frank Lincoln Wright in the farming town of [[Richland Center, Wisconsin]], United States, in 1867. His father, William Cary Wright (1825–1904),&lt;ref&gt;Huxtable, Ada Louise, ''Frank Lloyd Wright: A Life'', London: Penguin, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; was an orator, music teacher, occasional lawyer, and itinerant minister.  Wright's mother, Anna Lloyd Jones (1838/39 – 1923), met William Cary Wright while working as a county school teacher when William was the superintendent of schools for [[Richland County, Wisconsin|Richland County]].

Originally from [[Massachusetts]], William Wright had been a [[Baptist]] minister, but he later joined his wife's family in the [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] faith. Anna was a member of the well-known Lloyd Jones family who had emigrated from [[Wales]] to Spring Green, Wisconsin. One of Anna's brothers was [[Jenkin Lloyd Jones]], an important figure in the spread of the Unitarian faith in the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]]. Both of Wright's parents were strong-willed individuals with artistic interests that they passed on to him.

===Childhood===
According to Wright's autobiography, his mother declared when she was expecting that her first child would grow up to build beautiful buildings. She decorated his nursery with engravings of English cathedrals torn from a periodical to encourage the infant's ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Secrest|first=Meryle|title=Frank Lloyd Wright: A Biography|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=1998|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1870, the family moved to [[Weymouth, Massachusetts]], where William ministered to a small congregation.

In 1876, Anna visited the [[Centennial Exhibition]] in [[Philadelphia]], where she saw an exhibit of educational blocks created by [[Friedrich Fröbel|Friedrich Wilhelm August Fröbel]]. The blocks, known as [[Froebel Gifts]], were the foundation of his innovative [[kindergarten]] curriculum. Anna, a trained teacher, was excited by the program and bought a set with which young Wright spent much time playing. The blocks in the set were geometrically shaped and could be assembled in various combinations to form three-dimensional compositions. In his autobiography, Wright described the influence of these exercises on his approach to design: "For several years, I sat at the little kindergarten table-top… and played… with the cube, the sphere and the triangle—these smooth wooden maple blocks… All are in my fingers to this day… "&lt;ref&gt;Alofsin, Anthony (1993). Frank Lloyd Wright--the Lost Years, 1910–1922: A Study of Influence. University of Chicago Press. p. 359. {{ISBN|0-226-01366-9}}; Hersey, George (2000). Architecture and Geometry in the Age of the Baroque. University of Chicago Press. p. 205. {{ISBN|0-226-32783-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Wright's buildings are notable for their geometrical clarity.

The Wright family struggled financially in Weymouth and returned to Spring Green, where the supportive Lloyd Jones clan could help William find employment. They settled in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], where William taught music lessons and served as the secretary to the newly formed Unitarian society. Although William was a distant parent, he shared his love of music, especially the works of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]], with his children.

Soon after Wright turned 14, his parents separated. Anna had been unhappy for some time with William's inability to provide for his family and asked him to leave. The divorce was finalized in 1885 after William sued Anna for lack of physical affection. William left Wisconsin after the divorce, and Wright claimed he never saw his father again.&lt;ref&gt;''An Autobiography,'' by Frank Lloyd Wright, Duell, Sloan and Pearce, New York City, 1943, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; At this time he changed his middle name from Lincoln to Lloyd in honor of his mother's family, the Lloyd Joneses.

===Education (1885–1887)===
Wright attended Madison High School; it is unknown if he graduated.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p.72&lt;/ref&gt; In 1886 he was admitted to the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] as a special student. While there, Wright joined [[Phi Delta Theta]] [[fraternities and sororities|fraternity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phideltatheta.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=161|title=Phi Delta Theta Fraternity – Become the Greatest Version of Yourself|website=Phideltatheta.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; took classes part-time for two semesters, and worked with Allan D. Conover, a professor of civil engineering.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; Wright left the school without taking a degree, although he was granted an honorary doctorate of fine arts from the university in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[https://secfac.wisc.edu/awards-lectures/honorary-degrees/recipients/#1950-1969 Honorary Degree Recipients, 1856-2017]. University of Wisconsin-Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
===Silsbee and other early work experience (1887–1888)===
In 1887, Wright arrived in Chicago in search of employment. As a result of the devastating [[Great Chicago Fire of 1871]] and a population boom, new development was plentiful. Wright later recalled that while his first impressions of Chicago were that of grimy neighborhoods, crowded streets, and disappointing architecture, he was determined to find work. Within days, and after interviews with several prominent firms, he was hired as a [[Drafter|draftsman]] with the architectural firm of [[Joseph Lyman Silsbee]].&lt;ref name=Wright /&gt; Wright previously collaborated with Silsbee—accredited as the draftsman and the construction supervisor—on the 1886 [[Unity Chapel]] for Wright's family in Spring Green.&lt;ref name=FLWF /&gt; While with the firm, he also worked on two other family projects: All Souls Church in Chicago for his uncle, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, and the [[Hillside Home School I]] in Spring Green for two of his aunts.&lt;ref name=OGorman /&gt; Other draftsmen who worked for Silsbee in 1887 included future architects Cecil Corwin, [[George W. Maher]], and [[George Grant Elmslie|George G. Elmslie]]. Wright soon befriended Corwin, with whom he lived until he found a permanent home.

Feeling that he was underpaid for the quality of his work for Silsbee (at $8 a week), the young draftsman quit and found work as a [[Architectural designer|designer]] at the firm of Beers, Clay, and Dutton. However, Wright soon realized that he was not ready to handle building design by himself; he left his new job to return to Joseph Silsbee—this time with a raise in salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Silsbee adhered mainly to [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] and [[Revivalism (architecture)|Revivalist]] architecture, Wright found his work to be more "gracefully picturesque" than the other "brutalities" of the period.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright aspired for more progressive work.

===Adler &amp; Sullivan (1888–1893)===

Wright learned that the Chicago firm of [[Dankmar Adler|Adler]] &amp; [[Louis Sullivan|Sullivan]] was "looking for someone to make the finished  drawings for the interior of the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Building]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright demonstrated that he was a competent impressionist of Louis Sullivan's ornamental designs and two short interviews later, was an official [[Apprenticeship|apprentice]] in the firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright did not get along well with Sullivan's other draftsmen; he wrote that several violent altercations occurred between them during the first years of his apprenticeship. For that matter, Sullivan showed very little respect for his employees, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=89–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, "Sullivan took [Wright] under his wing and gave him great design responsibility." As an act of respect, Wright would later refer to Sullivan as ''Lieber Meister'' (German for "Dear Master").&lt;ref name=Tafel /&gt; He also formed a bond with office foreman Paul Mueller. Wright later engaged Mueller to build several of his public and commercial buildings between 1903 and 1923.&lt;ref name=Saint /&gt;

[[File:Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio (west side zoom).JPG|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's home]] in [[Oak Park, Illinois]] (1889)]]

On June 1, 1889, Wright married his first wife, Catherine Lee "Kitty" Tobin (1871–1959). The two had met around a year earlier during activities at All Souls Church. Sullivan did his part to facilitate the financial success of the young couple by granting Wright a five-year employment contract. Wright made one more request: "Mr. Sullivan, if you want me to work for you as long as five years, couldn't you lend me enough money to build a little house?"&lt;ref name="Wright 2005, p. 97"&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; With Sullivan's $5,000 loan, Wright purchased a lot at the corner of Chicago and Forest Avenues in the suburb of [[Oak Park, Illinois|Oak Park]]. The existing [[Gothic Revival]] house was given to his mother, while a compact [[shingle style]] house was built alongside for Wright and Catherine.&lt;ref name=Weil /&gt;

By 1890, Wright had an office next to Sullivan's that he shared with friend and draftsman [[George Elmslie]], who had been hired by Sullivan at Wright's request.&lt;ref name=Saint/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gebhard /&gt; Wright had risen to head draftsman and handled all residential design work in the office. As a general rule, the firm of Adler &amp; Sullivan did not design or build houses, but would oblige when asked by the clients of their important commercial projects. Wright was occupied by the firm's major commissions during office hours, so house designs were relegated to evening and weekend overtime hours at his home studio. He later claimed total responsibility for the design of these houses, but a careful inspection of their architectural style (and accounts from historian Robert Twombly) suggests that Sullivan dictated the overall form and motifs of the residential works; Wright's design duties were often reduced to detailing the projects from Sullivan's sketches.&lt;ref name=Gebhard/&gt; During this time, Wright worked on [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow|Sullivan's bungalow]] (1890) and the James A. Charnley bungalow (1890) in [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], the Berry-MacHarg House, [[James A. Charnley House]] (both 1891), and the Louis Sullivan House (1892), all in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind /&gt;

[[File:Oak Park Il Walter Gale House4.jpg|thumb|The [[Walter Gale House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1893). While a [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] in style, it features window bands and a cantilevered porch roof which hint at Wright's developing aesthetics]]

Despite Sullivan's loan and overtime salary, Wright was constantly short on funds. Wright admitted that his poor finances were likely due to his expensive tastes in wardrobe and vehicles, and the extra luxuries he designed into his house. To supplement his income and repay his debts, Wright accepted independent commissions for at least nine houses. These "bootlegged" houses, as he later called them, were conservatively designed in variations of the fashionable [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] and [[Colonial Revival architecture|Colonial Revival]] styles. Nevertheless, unlike the prevailing architecture of the period, each house emphasized simple geometric massing and contained features such as bands of horizontal windows, occasional [[cantilever]]s, and open floor plans, which would become hallmarks of his later work. Eight of these early houses remain today, including the [[Thomas H. Gale House|Thomas Gale]], [[Robert P. Parker House|Robert Parker]], George Blossom, and [[Walter Gale House|Walter Gale]] houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=38–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the residential projects for Adler &amp; Sullivan, he designed his bootleg houses on his own time. Sullivan knew nothing of the independent works until 1893, when he recognized that one of the houses was unmistakably a Frank Lloyd Wright design. This particular house, built for Allison Harlan, was only blocks away from Sullivan's townhouse in the Chicago community of [[Kenwood, Chicago|Kenwood]]. Aside from the location, the geometric purity of the composition and balcony [[tracery]] in the same style as the Charnley House likely gave away Wright's involvement. Since Wright's five-year contract forbade any outside work, the incident led to his departure from Sullivan's firm.&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt; Several stories recount the break in the relationship between Sullivan and Wright; even Wright later told two different versions of the occurrence. In ''An Autobiography'', Wright claimed that he was unaware that his side ventures were a breach of his contract. When Sullivan learned of them, he was angered and offended; he prohibited any further outside commissions and refused to issue Wright the [[deed]] to his Oak Park house until after he completed his five years. Wright could not bear the new hostility from his master and thought the situation was unjust. He "threw down [his] pencil and walked out of the Adler &amp; Sullivan office never to return." Dankmar Adler, who was more sympathetic to Wright's actions, later sent him the deed.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=101}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Wright told his [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] apprentices (as recorded by Edgar Tafel) that Sullivan fired him on the spot upon learning of the Harlan House. Tafel also recounted that Wright had Cecil Corwin sign several of the bootleg jobs, indicating that Wright was aware of their illegal nature.&lt;ref name=Lind/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tafel|1985|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the correct series of events, Wright and Sullivan did not meet or speak for 12 years.

===Transition and experimentation (1893–1900)===
After leaving Louis Sullivan's firm, Wright established his own practice on the top floor of the Sullivan-designed [[Schiller Building]] on [[Randolph Street (Chicago)|Randolph Street]] in Chicago. Wright chose to locate his office in the building because the tower location reminded him of the office of Adler &amp; Sullivan. Although Cecil Corwin followed Wright and set up his architecture practice in the same office, the two worked independently and did not consider themselves partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896, Wright moved out of the Schiller Building and into the nearby and newly completed [[Steinway Hall (Chicago)|Steinway Hall]] building. The loft space was shared with Robert C. Spencer, Jr., [[Myron Hunt]], and [[Dwight H. Perkins (architect)|Dwight H. Perkins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; These young architects, inspired by the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]] and the philosophies of Louis Sullivan, formed what  became known as the Prairie School.&lt;ref name=Brooks /&gt; They were joined by Perkins' apprentice, [[Marion Mahony Griffin|Marion Mahony]], who in 1895 transferred to Wright's team of drafters and took over production of his [[Architectural drawing#Presentation drawings|presentation drawings]] and watercolor [[Architectural rendering|renderings]]. Mahony, the third woman to be licensed as an architect in Illinois and one of the first licensed female architects in the U.S., also designed furniture, leaded glass windows, and light fixtures, among other features, for Wright's houses. Between 1894 and the early 1910s, several other leading Prairie School architects and many of Wright's future employees launched their careers in the offices of Steinway Hall.&lt;ref name=Cassidy /&gt;&lt;ref name=MIT /&gt;

[[File:William H. Winslow House Front Facade.jpg|thumb|[[William H. Winslow House]] in [[River Forest, Illinois]] (1893)]]

Wright's projects during this period followed two basic models. His first independent commission, the [[Winslow House (River Forest, Illinois)|Winslow House]], combined Sullivanesque ornamentation with the emphasis on simple geometry and horizontal lines. The Francis Apartments (1895, demolished 1971), [[Heller House]] (1896), [[Rollin Furbeck House]] (1897) and Husser House (1899, demolished 1926) were designed in the same mode. For his more conservative clients, Wright designed more traditional dwellings. These included the [[Dutch Colonial Revival architecture|Dutch Colonial Revival]] style Bagley House (1894), [[Tudor Revival architecture|Tudor Revival]] style [[Nathan G. Moore House|Moore House I]] (1895), and [[Queen Anne Style architecture (United States)|Queen Anne]] style [[Charles E. Roberts]] House (1896).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|pp=56–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Wright could not afford to turn down clients over disagreements in taste, even his most conservative designs retained simplified massing and occasional Sullivan-inspired details.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nathan G. Moore house (1895), Oak Park, IL, rear.JPG|thumb|[[Nathan G. Moore House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1895)]]

Soon after the completion of the Winslow House in 1894, Edward Waller, a friend and former client, invited Wright to meet Chicago architect and planner [[Daniel Burnham]]. Burnham had been impressed by the Winslow House and other examples of Wright's work; he offered to finance a four-year education at the [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts|École des Beaux-Arts]] and two years in Rome. To top it off, Wright would have a position in Burnham's firm upon his return. In spite of guaranteed success and support of his family, Wright declined the offer. Burnham, who had directed the classical design of the [[World's Columbian Exposition]], was a major proponent of the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux Arts movement]], thought that Wright was making a foolish mistake. Yet for Wright, the classical education of the École lacked creativity and was altogether at odds with his vision of modern American architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|2005|pp=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldberger /&gt;

[[File:Frank LLoyd Wright Studio Chicago Frontage.jpg|thumb|[[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|Wright's studio]] viewed from [[Chicago Avenue]] (1898)]]

Wright relocated his practice to his home in 1898  to bring his work and family lives closer. This move made further sense as the majority of the architect's projects at that time were in Oak Park or neighboring River Forest. The birth of three more children prompted Wright to sacrifice his original home studio space for additional bedrooms and necessitated his design and construction of an expansive [[Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio|studio addition]] to the north of the main house. The space, which included a hanging [[balcony]] within the two-story drafting room, was one of Wright's first experiments with innovative structure. The studio was a poster for Wright's developing aesthetics, and would become the laboratory from which the next 10 years of architectural creations would emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright Preservation Trust 2001, pp. 6–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prairie houses (1900–1914)===
By 1901, Wright had completed about 50 projects, including many houses in Oak Park. As his son John Lloyd Wright wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt; "[[William Eugene Drummond]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Walter Burley Griffin]], [[Albert Chase McArthur]], Marion Mahony, [[Isabel Roberts]], and [[George Willis (architect)|George Willis]] were the draftsmen. Five men, two women. They wore flowing ties, and smocks suitable to the realm. The men wore their hair like Papa, all except Albert, he didn't have enough hair. They worshiped Papa! Papa liked them! I know that each one of them was then making valuable contributions to the pioneering of the modern American architecture for which my father gets the full glory, headaches, and recognition today!"&lt;ref&gt;''My Father: Frank Lloyd Wright,'' by John Lloyd Wright; 1992; page 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Arthur Heurtley House (1902), Oak Park, IL.JPG|thumb|[[Arthur Heurtley House]], Oak Park, Illinois (1902)]]
[[File:Darwin D. Martin House.jpg|thumb|[[Darwin D. Martin House]], [[Buffalo, New York]] (1904)]]
[[File:Taliesin600.jpg|thumb|Hillside Home School, [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]], Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902)]]

Between 1900 and 1901, Frank Lloyd Wright completed four houses which have since been identified as the onset of the "[[Prairie style]]". Two, the [[Warren Hickox House|Hickox]] and [[B. Harley Bradley House|Bradley Houses]], were the last transitional step between Wright's early designs and the Prairie creations.&lt;ref name=Clayton /&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Frank Thomas House|Thomas House]] and [[Willits House]] received recognition as the first mature examples of the new style.&lt;ref name=Sommer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Gorman|2004|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Wright gave his new ideas for the American house widespread awareness through two publications in the ''[[Ladies' Home Journal]]''. The articles were in response to an invitation from the president of [[Curtis Publishing Company]], [[Edward Bok]], as part of a project to improve modern house design. "A Home in a Prairie Town" and "A Small House with Lots of Room in it" appeared respectively in the February and July 1901 issues of the journal. Although neither of the affordable house plans was ever constructed, Wright received increased requests for similar designs in following years.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; Wright came to Buffalo and designed homes for three of the company's executives, including the [[Darwin D. Martin House]] in 1904.

Other Wright houses considered to be masterpieces of the Prairie Style are the Frederick [[Robie House]] in Chicago and the Avery and Queene [[Coonley House]] in [[Riverside, Illinois]]. The Robie House, with its soaring, [[cantilever]]ed roof lines, supported by a 110-foot-long (34-m) channel of steel, is the most dramatic. Its living and dining areas form virtually one uninterrupted space. With this and other buildings, included in the publication of the [[Wasmuth Portfolio]] (1910), Wright's work became known to European architects and had a profound influence on them after World War I. It is sometimes called the "cornerstone of modernism".

Wright's residential designs of this era were known as "prairie houses" because the designs complemented the land around Chicago.  Prairie-style houses often have a combination of these features: One or two-stories with one-story projections, an open floor plan, low-pitched roofs with broad, overhanging eaves, strong horizontal lines, ribbons of windows (often casements), a prominent central chimney, built-in stylized cabinetry, and a wide use of natural materials—especially stone and wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquehome.org/Architectural-Style/prairie.htm|title=Prairie School Architecture|website=www.antiquehome.org|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Textile concrete block system===
In the early 1920s, Wright designed a "[[Textile block house|textile]]" concrete block system reinforced by an internal system of bars. Wright first used his textile block system on the [[Millard House]] in Pasadena , California, in 1923. The Ennis house is now used in films, television, and print media to represent the future.&lt;ref name="loc" /&gt; Typically Wrightian is the joining of the structure to its site by a series of terraces that reach out into and reorder the landscape, making it an integral part of the architect's vision.&lt;ref name="loc"/&gt; With the [[Ennis House]] and the [[Samuel Freeman House]] (both 1923), Wright had further opportunities to test the limits of the textile block system, including limited use in the [[Arizona Biltmore Hotel]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, Arlene, ''Wright Sites'', Princeton Architectural Press, 1995, p. 16,&lt;/ref&gt; Wright's son, Lloyd Wright, supervised construction for the Storer, Freeman and Ennis Houses. Architectural historian [[Thomas Hines (architectural historian)|Thomas Hines]] has suggested that Lloyd's contribution to these projects is often overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hines|first1=Thomas S.|title=Architecture of the sun : Los Angeles modernism, 1900-1970|date=2010|publisher=Rizzoli|location=New York|isbn=9780847833207}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Notable public works (1900–1925)===
In 1900, Wright designed the house of [[Cornell]]'s chapter of [[Alpha Delta Phi]] literary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cornellsun.com/2009/01/29/cornell-architecture-myths-busted/|title=Cornell Architecture Myths: Busted|first=Ann|last=Lui|website=The Cornell Daily Sun|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright designed the [[Larkin Administration Building]] (completed in 1904, demolished in 1950.) Other early notable public buildings include the Hillside Home School, built for his aunts in Spring Green, Wisconsin (1902) and the [[Unity Temple]], home of the Unitarian Universalist congregation in Oak Park. As a lifelong [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] and member of Unity Temple, Wright offered his services to the congregation after their church burned down, working on the building from 1905 to 1909. Wright later said that Unity Temple was the edifice in which he ceased to be an architect of structure, and became an architect of space.  [[File:Frank Lloyd Wright LC-USZ62-36384.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|Wright in 1926]]Wright also designed the Geneva Inn ([[Lake Geneva, Wisconsin]], 1911), the [[Midway Gardens]] (Chicago, Illinois, 1913), the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] ([[Alberta]], Canada, 1914), and the [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (Tokyo, 1922).

==Midlife problems==

===Family abandonment{{anchor | Europe and personal troubles}}===
[[File:Taliesin-aerial-600.jpg|thumb|Aerial photo of Taliesin, Spring Green, Wisconsin]]
Local gossips noticed Wright's flirtations, and he developed a reputation in Oak Park as a man-about-town. His family had grown to six children, but Wright was not parental and he relied on his wife Catherine to care for them. In 1903, Wright designed a house for Edwin Cheney, a neighbor in Oak Park, and immediately took a liking to Cheney's wife, Mamah. [[Mamah Borthwick|Mamah Borthwick Cheney]] was a modern woman with interests outside the home. She was an early feminist, and Wright viewed her as his intellectual equal. The two fell in love, and they became the talk of the town, as they often could be seen taking rides in Wright's automobile through Oak Park. Wright's wife, Kitty, sure that this attachment would fade as the others had, refused to grant him a divorce. Mamah had to live in Europe for two years to obtain a divorce from Edwin on the grounds of desertion.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1909, even before the Robie House was completed, Wright and Mamah Cheney met up in Europe, leaving their spouses and children behind. Wright had begun to reject the upper-middle-class Prairie Style [[single-family house]] model, intending to work on more democratic architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Storrer |first1=William Allin |title=The architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright : a complete catalog |date=2007 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=0226776204 |page=xvii |edition=Updated 3rd }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also frustrated by not getting larger commissions for commercial or public buildings.

What drew Wright to Europe was the chance to publish a portfolio of his work with Berlin publisher [[Ernst Wasmuth Verlag|Ernst Wasmuth]].&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 202&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting two volumes, titled ''Studies and Executed Buildings of Frank Lloyd Wright'', were published in 1911 in two editions, creating the first major exposure of Wright's work in Europe. The work contained more than 100 [[lithograph]]s of Wright's designs, and was commonly known as the ''[[Wasmuth Portfolio]]''.

Wright remained in Europe for almost a year and set up home first in [[Florence, Italy]]—where he lived with his eldest son Lloyd—and later in [[Fiesole, Italy]], where he lived with Mamah. During this time, Edwin Cheney granted Mamah a divorce, though Kitty still refused to grant one to her husband. After Wright returned to the United States in October 1910, he persuaded his mother to buy land for him in Spring Green, Wisconsin. The land, bought on April 10, 1911, was adjacent to land held by his mother's family, the Lloyd-Joneses. Wright began to build himself a new home, which he called {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]]}}, by May 1911. The recurring theme of {{lang|cy|Taliesin}} also came from his mother's side: {{lang|cy|[[Taliesin]]}} in [[Welsh mythology]] was a poet, magician, and priest. The family motto, "''{{lang|cy|Y Gwir yn Erbyn y Byd}}''" ("The Truth Against the World"), was taken from the Welsh poet {{lang|cy|[[Iolo Morganwg]]}}, who also had a son named Taliesin. The motto is still used today as the cry of the druids and chief bard of the {{lang|cy|[[Eisteddfod]]}} in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228212826/http://www.unitychapel.org/home_country.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 28, 2005 |title=Home Country |publisher=Unitychapel.org |date=July 1, 2005 |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Catastrophe at Taliesin studio===
On August 15, 1914, while Wright was working in Chicago, Julian Carlton, a male servant from [[Barbados]], who had been hired several months earlier, set fire to the living quarters of Taliesin and murdered seven people with an [[axe]] as the fire burned.&lt;ref name="bbccarlton" /&gt; The dead included Mamah; her two children, John and Martha Cheney; a gardener (David Lindblom); a draftsman (Emil Brodelle); a workman (Thomas Brunker); and another workman's son (Ernest Weston). Two people survived the mayhem, one of whom, William Weston, helped to put out the fire that almost completely consumed the residential wing of the house. Carlton swallowed [[hydrochloric acid]] immediately following the attack in an attempt to [[suicide|kill himself]].&lt;ref name="bbccarlton" /&gt; He was nearly [[Lynching|lynched]] on the spot, but was taken to the [[Dodgeville, Wisconsin|Dodgeville]] jail.&lt;ref name="bbccarlton" /&gt; Carlton died from [[starvation]] seven weeks after the attack, despite medical attention.&lt;ref name="bbccarlton" /&gt;

===Divorce and further troubles===
In 1922, Kitty Wright finally granted Wright a divorce. Under the terms of the divorce, Wright was required to wait one year before he could marry his then-mistress, Maude "Miriam" Noel. In 1923, Wright's mother, Anna (Lloyd Jones) Wright, died. Wright wed Miriam Noel in November 1923, but her addiction to [[morphine]] led to the failure of the marriage in less than one year. In 1924, after the separation, but while still married, Wright met [[Olgivanna Lloyd Wright|Olga (Olgivanna) Lazovich Hinzenburg]] at a Petrograd Ballet performance in Chicago. They moved in together at Taliesin in 1925, and soon Olgivanna was pregnant with their daughter, Iovanna, born on December 2, 1925.

On April 20, 1925, another fire destroyed the bungalow at Taliesin. Crossed wires from a newly installed telephone system were deemed to be responsible for the blaze, which destroyed a collection of Japanese prints that Wright estimated to be worth $250,000 to $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 315–317.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright rebuilt the living quarters, naming the home "Taliesin III".

In 1926, Olga's ex-husband, Vlademar Hinzenburg, sought custody of his daughter, Svetlana. In October 1926, Wright and Olgivanna were accused of violating the [[Mann Act]] and arrested in [[Tonka Bay, Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;Minnesota Historical Society, Collections Up Close, "[http://discussions.mnhs.org/collections/2011/01/frank-lloyd-wright-arrested-in-minnesota/ Frank Lloyd Wright Arrested in Minnesota]"&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were later dropped.

Wright and Miriam Noel's divorce was finalized in 1927, and once again, Wright was required to wait for one year before remarrying. Wright and Olgivanna married in 1928.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

==Later career==
===Taliesin Fellowship===
In 1932, Wright and his wife Olgivanna put out a call for students to come to Taliesin to study and work under Wright while they learned architecture and spiritual development. (Olgivanna Wright had been a student of [[G. I. Gurdjieff]]). Twenty-three came to live and work that year, as did many more in the years that followed. 
Considerable controversy existed over the living conditions and education of the fellows; recent books have given conflicting and often unflattering pictures of their treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Friedland, Roger, and Harold Zellman. ''The Fellowship: The Untold Story of Frank Lloyd Wright &amp; the Taliesin Fellowship''. New York: Harper Perennial, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marty, Myron A, and Shirley L. Marty. ''Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin Fellowship''. Kirksville, Mo: Truman State University Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; The Fellowship has evolved into what is now the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, an accredited school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://taliesin.edu/|title=Taliesin – Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture|website=taliesin.edu|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright was reputedly a difficult person to work with. One apprentice wrote: "He is devoid of consideration and has a blind spot regarding others' qualities. Yet I believe, that a year in his studio would be worth any sacrifice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/architecture/architect-of-desire-frank-lloyd-wrights-private-life-was-even-more-unforgettable-than-his-buildings-1637537.html|author=Marcus Field |title=Architect of desire: Frank Lloyd Wright's private life was even more unforgettable than his buildings |date=March 8, 2009 |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=December 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usonian Houses===
[[File:Weltzheimer Johnson House 2010.jpg|thumb|[[Weltzheimer/Johnson House|Charles Weltzheimer Residence]], Oberlin, Ohio (1948)]]
{{Main|Usonia}}

Wright is responsible for a series of concepts of suburban development united under the term [[Broadacre City]]. He proposed the idea in his book ''The Disappearing City'' in 1932, and unveiled a {{convert|12|ft2|m2|adj=on}} model of this community of the future, showing it in several venues in the following years. Concurrent with the development of Broadacre City, also referred to as Usonia, Wright conceived a new type of dwelling that came to be known as the [[Usonia]]n House. Although an early version of the form can be seen in the [[Malcolm Willey House]] (1934) in Minneapolis, the Usonian ideal emerged most completely in the [[Herbert and Katherine Jacobs First House]] (1937) in Madison, Wisconsin. Designed on a gridded concrete slab that integrated the house's radiant heating system, the house featured new approaches to construction, including sandwich walls that consisted of layers of wood siding, plywood cores and building paper, a significant change from typically framed walls.&lt;ref&gt;Twombly, p.242&lt;/ref&gt; Usonian houses commonly featured flat roofs and were usually constructed without basements or attics, all features that Wright had been promoting since the early 20th century.

Usonian houses were Wright's response to the transformation of domestic life that occurred in the early 20th century when servants had become less prominent or completely absent from most American households. By developing homes with progressively more open plans, Wright allotted the woman of the house a 'workspace', as he often called the kitchen, where she could keep track of and be available for the children and/or guests in the dining room.&lt;ref&gt;Twombly, p.257&lt;/ref&gt; As in the Prairie Houses, Usonian living areas had a fireplace as a point of focus. Bedrooms, typically isolated and relatively small, encouraged the family to gather in the main living areas. The conception of spaces instead of rooms was a development of the Prairie ideal. The built-in furnishings related to the Arts and Crafts movement's principles which influenced Wright's early work. Spatially and in terms of their construction, the Usonian houses represented a new model for independent living, and allowed dozens of clients to live in a Wright-designed house at relatively low cost. His Usonian homes set a new style for suburban design that influenced countless postwar developers.&lt;ref&gt;Twombly, p.244&lt;/ref&gt; Many features of modern American homes date back to Wright: open plans, slab-on-grade foundations, and simplified construction techniques that allowed more mechanization and efficiency in building.

===Significant later works===
[[File:Guggenheim museum exterior.jpg|thumb|[[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]], New York City (1959)]]

[[File:Wrightfallingwater.jpg|thumb|[[Fallingwater]], [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]] (1937)]] ''Fallingwater'', one of Wright's most famous private residences (completed 1937), was built for Mr. and Mrs. [[Edgar J. Kaufmann|Edgar J. Kaufmann, Sr.]], at [[Mill Run, Pennsylvania]]. Constructed over a 30-foot waterfall, it was designed according to Wright's desire to place the occupants close to the natural surroundings. The house was intended to be more of a family getaway, rather than a live-in home.&lt;ref name="Twombly1979" /&gt; The construction is a series of cantilevered balconies and terraces, using [[limestone]] for all verticals and concrete for the horizontals. The house cost $155,000, including the architect's fee of $8,000. It was one of Wright's most expensive pieces.&lt;ref name="Twombly1979" /&gt; Kaufmann's own engineers argued that the design was not sound. They were overruled by Wright, but the contractor secretly added extra steel to the horizontal concrete elements. In 1994, Robert Silman and Associates examined the building and developed a plan to restore the structure. In the late 1990s, steel supports were added under the lowest cantilever until a detailed structural analysis could be done. In March 2002, [[post-tensioned concrete|post-tensioning]] of the lowest terrace was completed.

Taliesin West, Wright's winter home and studio complex in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], was a laboratory for Wright from 1937 to his death in 1959. Now the home of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation and archives, it continues today as the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture.
Wright turned 80 shortly after World War II ended, yet remained busy. The [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum]] in New York City occupied Wright for 16&amp;nbsp;years (1943–1959)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guggenheim.org/new-york/about/frank-lloyd-wright-building|title=The Frank Lloyd Wright Building|date=November 10, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is probably his most recognized masterpiece. The building rises as a warm beige spiral from its site on [[Fifth Avenue]]; its interior is similar to the inside of a [[seashell]]. Its unique central geometry was meant to allow visitors to easily experience Guggenheim's collection of nonobjective geometric paintings by taking an elevator to the top level and then viewing artworks by walking down the slowly descending, central spiral ramp, the floor of which is embedded with circular shapes and triangular light fixtures to complement the geometric nature of the structure. However, when the museum was completed, a number of details of Wright's design were ignored, such as his desire for the interior to be painted off-white.

[[File:Price tower.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Price Tower]] in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]] (1956)]]
The only realized skyscraper designed by Wright is the [[Price Tower]], a 19-story tower in [[Bartlesville, Oklahoma]]. It is also one of the two existing vertically oriented Wright structures (the other is the [[S.C. Johnson Wax Research Tower]] in [[Racine, Wisconsin]]). The Price Tower was commissioned by Harold C. Price of the H. C. Price Company, a local [[oil pipeline]] and chemical firm. On March 29, 2007, Price Tower was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] by the [[United States Department of the Interior]], one of only 20 such properties in Oklahoma.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/listings/20070413.HTM National Park Service] — ''National Historic Landmarks Designated'', April 13, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monona Terrace]], originally designed in 1937 as municipal offices for Madison, Wisconsin, was completed in 1997 on the original site, using a variation of Wright's final design for the exterior, with the interior design altered by its new purpose as a convention center. The "as-built" design was carried out by Wright's apprentice Tony Puttnam. Monona Terrace was accompanied by controversy throughout the 60 years between the original design and the completion of the structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|title=Monona Terrace Convention Center, history web page|publisher=|accessdate=May 31, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303215652/http://www.mononaterrace.com/educatorspage/images/brief-history.pdf|archivedate=March 3, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Florida Southern College]], located in [[Lakeland, Florida]], constructed 12 (out of 18 planned) Frank Lloyd Wright buildings between 1941 and 1958 as part of the [[Child of the Sun]] project. It is the world's largest single-site collection of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bdcnetwork.com/74-years-later-frank-lloyd-wright-structure-built-florida-southern-college| title=74 years later, Frank Lloyd Wright structure built at Florida Southern College| date=October 31, 2013| publisher=Building Design &amp; Construction Magazine| access-date=July 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal style and concepts==
===Design elements===
[[File:Johnsonwax02.jpg|thumb|An open office area in Wright's Johnson Wax headquarters complex, Racine, Wisconsin (1939)]]
His Prairie houses use themed, coordinated design elements (often based on plant forms) that are repeated in windows, carpets, and other fittings. He made innovative use of new building materials such as [[precast concrete]] blocks, glass bricks, and zinc [[came]]s (instead of the traditional lead) for his leadlight windows, and he famously used [[Pyrex]] glass tubing as a major element in the [[Johnson Wax Headquarters]]. Wright was also one of the first architects to design and install custom-made electric light fittings, including some of the first electric floor lamps, and his very early use of the then-novel spherical glass lampshade (a design previously not possible due to the physical restrictions of gas lighting). In 1897, Wright received a patent for "Prism Glass Tiles" that were used in storefronts to direct light toward the interior.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailyartdaily.com/prismatic-tiles-frank-lloyd-wright-glass/&lt;/ref&gt; Wright fully embraced glass in his designs and found that it fit well into his philosophy of organic architecture. According to Wright's organic theory, all components of the building should appear unified, as though they belong together. Nothing should be attached to it without considering the effect on the whole. To unify the house to its site, Wright often used large expanses of glass to blur the boundary between the indoors and outdoors.&lt;ref name="TMCnet"&gt;{{cite web|author=Lync Voice UC Industry News|title=The Textile Block System [Concrete International]|url=http://www.lyncvoiceuc.com/news/2012/04/14/6258593.htm|publisher=TMCnet|accessdate=February 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glass allowed for interaction and viewing of the outdoors while still protecting from the elements. In 1928, Wright wrote an essay on glass in which he compared it to the mirrors of nature: lakes, rivers and ponds.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright. "In the Cause of Architecture, VI: The Meaning of Materials—Glass". ''The Architectural Record'', 64(July 1928), 10-16.&lt;/ref&gt; One of Wright's earliest uses of glass in his works was to string panes of glass along whole walls in an attempt to create light screens to join together solid walls. By using this large amount of glass, Wright sought to achieve a balance between the lightness and airiness of the glass and the solid, hard walls. Arguably, Wright's best-known art glass is that of the Prairie style. The simple geometric shapes that yield to very ornate and intricate windows represent some of the most integral ornamentation of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Carla|title=Frank Lloyd Wright's glass designs|date=1995|publisher=Pomegranate Artbooks|location=San Francisco|isbn=9780876544686|pages=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright also designed some of his own clothing. His fashion sense was unique and he usually wore expensive suits, flowing neckties, and capes. He had a fascination with automobiles, purchasing his first car in 1909, a Stoddard-Dayton roadster, and owned many exotic vehicles over the years. During the cash-strapped Depression, Wright drove cheaper vehicles. Some of his last cars in the 1950s included four Volkswagens and a Chevrolet Nomad wagon along with flashier articles such as a Jaguar Mark VII. He owned some 50 cars between 1909 and his death, of which 10 are known to survive.

===Influences and collaborations===
[[File:RobieHouseWindows ChicagoIL.jpg|thumb|Wright-designed window in [[Robie House]], Chicago (1906)]]
Wright strongly believed in individualism and did not affiliate with the [[American Institute of Architects]] during his career, going so far as to call the organization "a harbor of refuge for the incompetent," and "a form of refined gangsterism." When an associate referred to him as "an old amateur" Wright confirmed, "I am the oldest."&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography in Sound: Frank Lloyd Wright|url=https://archive.org/details/Biography_in_Sound|work=Old Time Radio|accessdate=September 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright rarely credited any influences on his designs, but most architects, historians and scholars agree he had five major influences:
# [[Louis Sullivan]], whom he considered to be his ''Lieber Meister'' (dear master)
# Nature, particularly shapes/forms and colors/patterns of plant life
# Music (his favorite composer was [[Ludwig van Beethoven]])
# Japanese art, prints and buildings
# [[Froebel Gifts]] &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Jeanne S.|date=1989-03-01|title=The Froebel-Wright Kindergarten Connection: A New Perspective|url=http://jsah.ucpress.edu/content/48/1/24|journal=Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=24–37|doi=10.2307/990404|issn=0037-9808}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also routinely claimed the work of architects and architectural designers who were his employees as his own designs, and also claimed that the rest of the Prairie School architects were merely his followers, imitators, and subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;"The Magic of America", Marion Mahony Griffin&lt;/ref&gt; As with any architect, though, Wright worked in a collaborative process and drew his ideas from the work of others. In his earlier days, Wright worked with some of the top architects of the [[Chicago School (architecture)|Chicago School]], including Sullivan. In his Prairie School days, Wright's office was populated by many talented architects, including [[William Eugene Drummond]], [[John Van Bergen]], [[Isabel Roberts]], Francis [[Barry Byrne]], [[Albert Chase McArthur|Albert McArthur]], [[Marion Mahony Griffin]], and [[Walter Burley Griffin]].

The Czech-born architect [[Antonin Raymond]], recognized as the father of modern architecture in Japan, worked for Wright at Taliesin and led the construction of the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo. He subsequently stayed in Japan and opened his own practice. [[Rudolph Schindler (architect)|Rudolf Schindler]] also worked for Wright on the Imperial Hotel. His own work is often credited as influencing Wright's Usonian houses. Schindler's friend [[Richard Neutra]] also worked briefly for Wright and became an internationally successful architect.

Later, in the [[Taliesin (studio)|Taliesin]] days, Wright employed many architects and artists who later become notable, such as [[Aaron Green (architect)|Aaron Green]], [[John Lautner]], [[E. Fay Jones]], [[Henry Klumb]], and [[Paolo Soleri]].

===Community planning===
Frank Lloyd Wright was interested in site and community planning throughout his career. His commissions and theories on urban design began as early as 1900 and continued until his death. He had 41 commissions on the scale of community planning or urban design.&lt;ref&gt;''Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs'', Charles E. and Berdeana Aguar, McGraw-Hill, 2002, p.344&lt;/ref&gt;

His thoughts on suburban design started in 1900 with a proposed subdivision layout for [[Charles E. Roberts]] entitled the "Quadruple Block Plan." This design strayed from traditional suburban lot layouts and set houses on small square blocks of four equal-sized lots surrounded on all sides by roads instead of straight rows of houses on parallel streets. The houses, which used the same design as published in "A Home in a Prairie Town" from the ''Ladies' Home Journal'', were set toward the center of the block to maximize the yard space and included private space in the center. This also allowed for far more interesting views from each house. Although this plan was never realized, Wright published the design in the ''Wasmuth Portfolio'' in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrightscapes: Frank Lloyd Wright's Landscape Designs|first1=Charles E.|last1=Aguar|first2=Berdeana|last2=Aguar|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=2002|pages=51–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more ambitious designs of entire communities were exemplified by his entry into the City Club of Chicago Land Development Competition in 1913. The contest was for the development of a suburban quarter section. This design expanded on the Quadruple Block Plan and included several social levels. The design shows the placement of the upscale homes in the most desirable areas and the [[blue collar]] homes and apartments separated by parks and common spaces. The design also included all the amenities of a small city: schools, museums, markets, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=544}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view of decentralization was later reinforced by theoretical [[Broadacre City]] design. The philosophy behind his community planning was decentralization. The new development must be away from the cities. In this decentralized America, all services and facilities could coexist "factories side by side with farm and home."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Undoing the City: Frank Lloyd Wright's Planned Communities|journal=American Quarterly|volume=24|issue=4|date=October 1972|page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*1949 – Parkwyn neighborhood, a [[plat]] in Kalamazoo, Michigan, developed by Wright containing mostly Usonian homes on circular lots with common spaces in between (since replatted)

===Japanese art===
Though most famous as an architect, Wright was an active dealer in Japanese art, primarily ''[[ukiyo-e]]'' [[woodblock printing in Japan|woodblock prints]]. He frequently served as both architect and art dealer to the same clients; he designed a home, then provided the art to fill it.&lt;ref name=cotter&gt;{{cite news |last=Cotter |first=Holland |title=Seeking Japan's Prints, Out of Love and Need |newspaper=New York Times |date=April 6, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/art-review-seeking-japan-s-prints-out-of-love-and-need.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Wright made more from selling art than from his work as an architect. Wright was also an avid collector of Japanese prints and used them as teaching aids with his apprentices in what were called "print parties".&lt;ref&gt;Julia Meech. ''Frank Lloyd Wright and the Art of Japan: The Architect's Other Passion''. New York: Abrams, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright first traveled to Japan in 1905, where he bought hundreds of prints. The following year, he helped organize the world's first retrospective exhibition of works by [[Hiroshige]], held at the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt; For many years, he was a major presence in the Japanese art world, selling a great number of works to prominent collectors such as John Spaulding of Boston,&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt; and to prominent museums such as the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.&lt;ref name=reif/&gt; He penned a book on Japanese art in 1912.&lt;ref name=reif/&gt;

In 1920, however, rival art dealers began to spread rumors that Wright was selling retouched prints; this, combined with Wright's tendency to live beyond his means, and other factors, led to great financial troubles for the architect. Though he provided his clients with genuine prints as replacements for those he was accused of retouching, this marked the end of the high point of his career as an art dealer.&lt;ref name=reif/&gt; He was forced to sell off much of his art collection in 1927 to pay off outstanding debts; the Bank of Wisconsin claimed his Taliesin home the following year, and sold thousands of his prints, for only one dollar a piece, to collector [[Edward Burr Van Vleck]].&lt;ref name=cotter/&gt;

Wright continued to collect and deal in prints until his death in 1959, using prints as collateral for loans, often relying upon his art business to remain financially solvent.&lt;ref name=reif&gt;{{cite news |last=Reif |first=Rita |title=Frank Lloyd Wright's Love of Japanese Prints Helped Pay the Bills |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 18, 2001 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/18/arts/art-architecture-the-master-builder-whose-other-love-helped-pay-the-bills.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of his dealings in Japanese art went largely unknown, or underestimated, among art historians for decades until, in 1980, Julia Meech, then associate curator of Japanese art at the Metropolitan Museum, began researching the history of the museum's collection of Japanese prints. She discovered "a three-inch-deep 'clump of 400 cards' from 1918, each listing a print bought from the same seller—'F. L. Wright'" and a number of letters exchanged between Wright and the museum's first curator of Far Eastern Art, Sigisbert C. Bosch Reitz, in 1918-22.&lt;ref name=reif/&gt; These discoveries, and subsequent research, led to a renewed understanding of Wright's career as an art dealer.

==Legacy==
===Death===
On April 4, 1959, Wright was hospitalized for abdominal pains and was operated on April 6. He seemed to be recovering, but he  died quietly on April 9.&lt;ref&gt;Huxtable, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; After his death, Wright's legacy was plagued with turmoil for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0608.html |title=Frank Lloyd Wright Dies; Famed Architect Was 89|publisher=nytimes.com&lt;! |date=April 10, 1959 |accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His third wife Olgivanna's dying wish had been that Wright, she, and her daughter by her first marriage all be cremated and interred together in a memorial garden being built at Taliesin West. According to his own wishes, Wright's body had lain in the Lloyd-Jones cemetery, next to the Unity Chapel, near Taliesin in Wisconsin. Although Olgivanna had taken no legal steps to move Wright's remains and against the wishes of other family members, as well as the Wisconsin legislature, in 1985, Wright's remains were removed from his grave by members of the Taliesin Fellowship, cremated, and sent to Scottsdale, where they were later interred in the memorial garden. The original grave site in Wisconsin, now empty, is still marked with Wright's name.&lt;ref&gt;Secrest, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

===Archives===
After Wright’s death, most of his archives were stored at the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation in Taliesin (in Wisconsin), and Taliesin West (in Arizona). These collections included more than 23,000 architectural drawings, some 44,000 photographs, 600 manuscripts, and more than 300,000 pieces of office and personal correspondence. It also contained about 40 large-scale architectural models, most of which were constructed for MoMA's retrospective of Wright in 1940.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Robin Pogrebin (September 3, 2012), [https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/04/arts/design/frank-lloyd-wright-collection-moves-to-moma-and-columbia.html A Vast Frank Lloyd Wright Archive Is Moving to New York] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, to guarantee a high level of conservation and access, as well as to transfer the considerable financial burden of maintaining the archive,&lt;ref&gt;Robin Pogrebin (March 9, 2014), [https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/10/arts/design/models-preserve-wrights-dreams.html Models Preserve Wright's Dreams] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation partnered with the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and the [[Avery Architectural and Fine Arts Library]] to move the archive's content to New York. Wright's furniture and art collection remains with the foundation, which will also have a role in monitoring the archive. These three parties established an advisory group to oversee exhibitions, symposiums, events, and publications.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

Photographs and other archival materials are held by the [[Ryerson &amp; Burnham|Ryerson and Burnham Libraries]] at the Art Institute of Chicago. The architect's personal [https://web.archive.org/web/20100122050418/http://www.franklloydwright.org/fllwf_web_091104/Archives.html archives] are located at Taliesin West in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Frank Lloyd Wright archives include photographs of his drawings, indexed correspondence beginning in the 1880s and continuing through Wright's life, and other ephemera. The Getty Research Center, Los Angeles, also has copies of Wright's correspondence and photographs of his drawings in their "[http://www.getty.edu/research/conducting_research/special_collections/wright.html Frank Lloyd Wright Special Collection]". Wright's correspondence is indexed in ''An Index to the Taliesin Correspondence'', ed. by Professor [[Anthony Alofsin]], which is available at larger libraries.

===Destroyed Wright buildings===
Wright designed over 400 built structures&lt;ref&gt;''The Architecture of Frank Lloyd Wright: A Complete Catalog,'' by William Allin Storrer, University of Chicago Press, 1992 (third edition)&lt;/ref&gt; of which about 300 survive {{as of|2005|lc=y}}. Four have been lost to forces of nature: the waterfront house for W. L. Fuller in [[Pass Christian, Mississippi]], destroyed by [[Hurricane Camille]] in August 1969; the [[Louis Sullivan Bungalow]] of [[Ocean Springs, Mississippi]], M destroyed by [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005; and the [[Arinobu Fukuhara House]] (1918) in [[Hakone, Kanagawa|Hakone, Japan]], destroyed in the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]]. In January 2006, the [[Wilbur Wynant House]] in [[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], Indiana was destroyed by fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationaltrust.org/magazine/archives/arc_news_2006/011706.htm |title=Preservation Online: Today's News Archives: Fire Guts Rare FLW House in Indiana |publisher=Nationaltrust.org |accessdate=October 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080220045039/http://www.nationaltrust.org/Magazine/archives/arc_news_2006/011706.htm|archivedate=February 20, 2008 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Wright buildings intentionally demolished: [[Midway Gardens]] (built 1913, demolished 1929), the [[Larkin Administration Building]] (built 1903, demolished 1950), the Francis Apartments and Francisco Terrace Apartments (Chicago, built 1895, demolished 1971 and 1974, respectively), the Geneva Inn (Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, built 1911, demolished 1970), and the [[Banff National Park Pavilion]] (built 1914, demolished 1934). The [[Imperial Hotel, Tokyo|Imperial Hotel]] (built 1923) survived the [[1923 Great Kantō earthquake]], but was demolished in 1968 due to urban developmental pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Berstein, Fred A.

===Recognition===
[[File:FrankLloydWright1966USstamp.jpg|thumb|left|1966 U.S. postage stamp honoring Frank Lloyd Wright]]

Later in his life (and after his death in 1959), Wright was accorded much honorary recognition for his lifetime achievements. He received a Gold Medal award from The [[Royal Institute of British Architects]]  in 1941. The [[American Institute of Architects]] awarded him the [[AIA Gold Medal]] in 1949. That medal was a symbolic "burying the hatchet" between Wright and the AIA. In a radio interview, he commented, "Well, the AIA I never joined, and they know why. When they gave me the gold medal in Houston, I told them frankly why. Feeling that the architecture profession is all that's the matter with architecture, why should I join them?"&lt;ref name="archive" /&gt; He was awarded the [[Franklin Institute]]'s [[Frank P. Brown Medal]] in 1953. He received honorary degrees from several universities (including his ''alma mater'', the University of Wisconsin), and several nations named him as an honorary board member to their national academies of art and/or architecture. In 2000, Fallingwater was named "The Building of the 20th century" in an unscientific "Top-Ten" poll taken by members attending the AIA annual convention in Philadelphia. On that list, Wright was listed along with many of the USA's other greatest architects including [[Eero Saarinen]], [[I.M. Pei]], [[Louis Kahn]], [[Philip Johnson]], and [[Ludwig Mies van der Rohe]]; he was the only architect who had more than one building on the list. The other three buildings were the Guggenheim Museum, the Frederick C. Robie House, and the Johnson Wax Building.

In 1992, the [[Madison Opera]] in Madison, Wisconsin, commissioned and premiered the opera ''[[Shining Brow]]'', by composer [[Daron Hagen]] and [[libretto|librettist]] [[Paul Muldoon]] based on events early in Wright's life. The work has since received numerous revivals, including a June 2013 revival at Fallingwater, in Bull Run, Pennsylvania, by Opera Theater of Pittsburgh. In 2000, ''[[Work Song: Three Views of Frank Lloyd Wright]]'', a play based on the relationship between the personal and working aspects of Wright's life, debuted at the [[Milwaukee Repertory Theater]].

In 1966, the [[United States Postal Service]] honored Wright with a [[Prominent Americans series]] 2¢ postage stamp. Several of Wright's buildings have been proposed by the United States to be [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage sites]].

"[[So Long, Frank Lloyd Wright]]" is a song written by [[Paul Simon]]. [[Art Garfunkel]] has stated that the origin of the song came from his request that Simon write a song about the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright. Simon himself stated that he knew nothing about Wright, but proceeded to write the song anyway.&lt;ref name=fire&gt;{{cite book|title=Fire and Rain: The Beatles, Simon and Garfunkel, James Taylor, CSNY, and the Bittersweet Story of 1970|author=Browne, D |pages= 45–46, 164–65|publisher= Da Capo Press|year= 2011|isbn= 978-0-306-81850-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, Arizona made plans to construct a new capitol building. Believing that the submitted plans for the new capitol were tombs to the past, Frank Lloyd Wright offered ''Oasis'' as an alternative to the people of Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oasis - Frank Lloyd Wright's Design for the Capitol|url=http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/landingpage/collection/oasis|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120926031805/http://azmemory.azlibrary.gov/cdm/landingpage/collection/oasis|dead-url=yes|archive-date=September 26, 2012|website=Arizona Library|publisher=Arizona Capitol Museum|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2004, one of the spires included in his design was erected in Scottsdale.

===Family===
Frank Lloyd Wright was married three times, fathering four sons and three daughters. He also adopted Svetlana Milanoff, the daughter of his third wife, Olgivanna Lloyd Wright.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ascedia.com|url=http://www.taliesinpreservation.org/frank/faq.htm#Wives_children|title=Taliesin Preservation, Inc. – Frank Lloyd Wright – FAQs|publisher=Taliesinpreservation.org|accessdate=October 16, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080610011735/http://www.taliesinpreservation.org/frank/faq.htm#Wives_children|archivedate=June 10, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[John Lloyd Wright]] (1892-1972), invented [[Lincoln Logs]] in 1918, and practiced architecture extensively in the San Diego area. John's daughter, [[Elizabeth Wright Ingraham]] (1922-2013), was an architect in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]. She was the mother of Christine, an interior designer in Connecticut, and Catherine, an architecture professor at the [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref name="Reflecting Pools"&gt;

* Frances Wright Caroe (1898-1959) was an arts administrator.
* Robert Llwellyn Wright (1903-1986) was an attorney for whom Wright designed a house in Bethesda, Maryland.

His children with Olgivanna were:

* Svetlana Peters (1917-1946, adopted daughter of Olgivanna) was a musician who died in an automobile accident with her son Daniel. After Svetlana's death her other son, Brandoch Peters (1942- ), was raised by Frank and Olgivanna. Svetlana's widower, [[William Wesley Peters]], was later briefly married to [[Svetlana Alliluyeva]], the youngest child and only daughter of [[Joseph Stalin]]. Peters served as chairman of the Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation from 1985 to 1991.
* Iovanna Lloyd Wright (1925-2015) was an artist and musician.

'''Gay sexual practices''' are [[Human sexual activity|sexual activities]] involving [[men who have sex with men]] (MSM), regardless of their [[sexual orientation]] or [[sexual identity]]. The authors of the 1948 [[Kinsey Reports]] state that 37% of their male subjects had had at least one homosexual experience.&lt;ref&gt;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male, p. 656&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence shows that sex between men is significantly underreported in surveys due to [[social desirability bias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Turner CF, Ku L, Rogers SM, Lindberg LD, Pleck JH, Sonenstein FL |title=Adolescent sexual behavior, drug use, and violence: increased reporting with computer survey technology |journal=Science  |volume=280 |issue=5365 |pages=867–73 |date=May 1998 |pmid=9572724 |doi=10.1126/science.280.5365.867}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nber.org"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Size of the LGBT Population and the Magnitude of Anti-Gay Sentiment are Substantially Underestimated |journal=Management Science |volume=63 |issue=10 |pages=3168–3186 |year=2013 |first1=Katherine B. |last1=Coffman |first2=Lucas C. |last2=Coffman |first3=Keith M.

Historically, [[anal sex]] has been popularly associated with male [[homosexuality]] and MSM. Many MSM, however, do not engage in anal sex, and may engage in [[oral sex]], [[Non-penetrative sex#Frottage|frottage]] or [[frot]], or [[mutual masturbation]] instead.&lt;ref name="Wellings"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kaye Wellings|author2=Kirstin Mitchell|author3= Martine Collumbien|title=Sexual Health: A Public Health Perspective|isbn = 0335244815|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw-Hill International]]|year=2012|page=91|accessdate=August 29, 2013|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZKveuj7dLd4C&amp;pg=PA91}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Not all"&gt;{{cite web|title=Not all gay men have anal sex |publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=June 13, 2008|accessdate=August 19, 2015|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/not-all-gay-men-have-anal-sex}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstone"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 =  Goldstone| first1 =Stephen E. | last2 = Welton| first2 = Mark L.| year = 2004 | title = Sexually Transmitted Diseases of the Colon, Rectum, and Anus| journal = Clin Colon Rectal Surg | volume = 17 | issue = 4 | pages = 235–239| doi = 10.1055/s-2004-836944| pmc=2780055 | pmid=20011265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Johnson and Johnson"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gay Perspective: Things Our Homosexuality Tells Us about the Nature of God &amp; the Universe|isbn = 978-1-59021-015-4 |publisher=[[Lethe Press]]|year=2008|page=139|accessdate=February 12, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=LPyhsuVbUlAC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author =Edwin Clark Johnson, [[Toby Johnson]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSM may also engage in different forms of oral sex, such as [[fellatio]], [[Tea bag (sexual act)|tea bagging]], and [[anilingus]]. Wellings et al. reported that "the equation of 'homosexual' with 'anal' sex among men is common among lay and health professionals alike," whereas an [[online survey]] of 18,000 MSM in Europe "showed that oral sex was most commonly practised, followed by mutual masturbation, with anal intercourse in third place."&lt;ref name="Wellings"/&gt; A 2011 survey by ''[[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]'' found similar results for U.S. gay and bisexual men. Kissing a partner on the mouth (74.5%), oral sex (72.7%), and partnered masturbation (68.4%) were the three most common behaviors, with 63.2% of the sample self-reporting five to nine different sexual behaviors during their last encounter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2011.02438.x | volume=8 | title=Sexual Behaviors and Situational Characteristics of Most Recent Male‐Partnered Sexual Event among Gay and Bisexually Identified Men in the United States | year=2011 | journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine | pages=3040–3050 | author=Rosenberger Joshua G}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among men who have anal sex with other men, the insertive partner may be referred to as the ''[[Top (sex)|top]]'', the one being penetrated may be referred to as the ''[[Bottom (sex)|bottom]]'', and those who enjoy either role may be referred to as ''[[versatile (sex)|versatile]]''.&lt;ref name="Underwood"/&gt; Pleasure, pain, or both may accompany anal sex. While the [[nerve]] endings in the [[Human anus|anus]] can provide pleasurable feelings, an [[orgasm]] may be achieved through receptive anal penetration by indirect stimulation of the [[prostate]].&lt;ref name="Prostate/Hot spot"&gt;{{cite web|title= The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=Apr 1, 2011|accessdate=April 21, 2010|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/male-hot-spot-massaging-prostate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book |first=Martha |last= Rosenthal| title = Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society | publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]|year = 2012|pages=133–135|accessdate = September 17, 2012| isbn = 0618755713|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn = 0-8018-9396-8|publisher=JHU Press|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=November 6, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108|author1=Komisaruk, Barry R. |author2=Whipple, Beverly |author3=Nasserzadeh, Sara |author4=Beyer-Flores, Carlos }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the [[National Survey of Sexual Health and Behavior]] (NSSHB) indicated that men who self-report taking a receptive position during anal sex in their last encounter were at least as likely to have reached orgasm as men who adopted an insertive role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-gender-orgasm-gap/|author=[[Mona Chalabi]]|publisher=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|date=20 August 2015|title=The Gender Orgasm Gap}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study sampling single people in the U.S. indicated that orgasm rates are similar among men across sexual orientations.&lt;ref name="onlinelibrary.wiley.com"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Variation in Orgasm Occurrence by Sexual Orientation in a Sample of U.S. Singles|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jsm.12669/abstract|year=2014|doi=10.1111/jsm.12669|journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine|volume=11|issue=11|pages=2645–2652|author=Garcia Justin R}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to pain or being uncomfortable during anal sex,&lt;ref name="Anal Pain"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pain from anal sex, and how to prevent it|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=June 26, 2009|accessdate=April 7, 2011|url=http://goaskalice.columbia.edu/pain-anal-sex-and-how-prevent-it}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heidelbaugh"&gt;{{cite book|title =Clinical men's health: evidence in practice|publisher=[[Elsevier Health Sciences]]|year=2007|page=273|accessdate=October 14, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4N_6nOH5BAEC&amp;pg=PA273| author =Joel J.

With regard to [[non-penetrative sex]], there is also variety. Frot is a form of male-male sexual activity that usually involves direct [[Human penis|penis]]-to-penis contact.&lt;ref name="Perez"&gt;{{cite book | author =Joe Perez|title=Rising Up|isbn=1411691733|publisher=[[Lulu (company)|Lulu.com]]|year=2006|pages=190–192|accessdate=March 24, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/?id=caJ7gPv0DrAC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=The New Sex Police|publisher=''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]''|date=2005-04-12|accessdate=February 12, 2011|pages=39–40, 42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mGMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a form of frottage. Frot can be enjoyable because it mutually and simultaneously stimulates the genitals of both partners as it tends to produce pleasurable friction against the [[Frenulum of prepuce of penis|frenulum]] nerve bundle on the underside of each man's penile shaft, just below the [[External urethral orifice (male)|urinary opening]] (meatus) of the penis [[glans penis|head]] (glans penis). [[Intercrural sex]] is another form of non-penetrative sex that can be practiced between MSM. [[Docking (sex)|Docking]] (the insertion of one man's penis into another man's foreskin) is also practiced.

Various [[sex position]]s may be performed. In one study of U.K. and U.S. respondents, those respondents who identified as gay reported that [[doggy style]], [[Missionary position|missionary]], [[69 (sex position)|69]], oral, and anal (in that order) were their favorite sex positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dred.com/uk/preferred-positions.html | title = Preferred Positions: A Look at Sexual Favourites Across Europe and the U.S. | website = DrEd.com | access-date = March 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSM may also engage in [[BDSM]] or use [[sex toys]]. A nationally representative survey carried out in Australia from 2001 to 2002 found that, in the 12 months prior to the survey, 4.4% of gay men and 14.2% of bisexual men participated in BDSM-related sexual activities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Richters J. |author2=De Visser R.

The mission of the institute "is to understand biological processes which alter the genetic makeup of different organisms, as a basis for potential gene therapy and genome engineering techniques."[https://web.archive.org/web/19981203120148/http://www.girinst.org/] The institute specializes in applying computer tools to analysis of [[DNA]] and [[protein]] sequence information. GIRI develops and maintains Repbase Update, a [[database]] of prototypic [[sequences]] representing [[repetitive DNA]] from different [[eukaryotic]] species, and Repbase Reports, an electronic journal established in 2001 [http://www.girinst.org/repbase/index.html]. Repetitive DNA is primarily derived from [[transposable elements]] (TEs), which include DNA [[transposons]] belonging to around 20 superfamilies and [[retrotransposons]] that can also be sub-classified into subfamilies . The majority of known superfamilies of DNA [[transposons]] were discovered or co-discovered at GIRI, including [[Helitron (biology)]], ''Academ, Dada, Ginger, Kolobok, Novosib, Sola, Transib, Zator, PIF/Harbinger'' and ''Polinton/Maverick''. An ancient element from the ''Transib'' superfamily was identified as the evolutionary precursor of the [[Recombination activating gene]]. GIRI has hosted three international conferences devoted to the genomic impact of eukaryotic transposable elements [http://www.girinst.org/conference/index.html].

A '''genetic marker''' is a gene or [[DNA sequence]] with a known location on a [[chromosome]] that can be used to identify  individuals or [[species]]. It can be described as a variation (which may arise due to mutation or alteration in the genomic loci) that can be observed. A genetic marker may be a short DNA sequence, such as a sequence surrounding a single base-pair change ([[single nucleotide polymorphism]], SNP), or a long one, like [[minisatellite]]s.

==Background==
For many years, [[gene mapping]] was limited to identifying organisms by traditional phenotype markers. This included genes that encoded easily observable characteristics such as blood types or seed shapes. The insufficient number of these types of characteristics in several organisms limited the mapping efforts that could be done. This prompted the development of gene markers which could identify genetic characteristics that are not readily observable in organisms (such as protein variation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Benjamin A. Pierce|title=Genetics: A Conceptual Approach|date=2013-12-27|publisher=Macmillan Learning|isbn=978-1-4641-0946-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
[[File:SFP discovery principle.jpg|thumb|SFP discovery principle for gene probing]]

Some commonly used types of genetic markers are:
* RFLP (or [[Restriction fragment length polymorphism]])
* SSLP (or [[Simple sequence length polymorphism]])
* AFLP (or [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]])
* RAPD (or [[RAPD|Random amplification of polymorphic DNA]])
* VNTR (or [[Variable number tandem repeat]])
* SSR  [[Microsatellite (genetics)|Microsatellite]] polymorphism, (or [[Microsatellite (genetics)|Simple sequence repeat]])
* SNP (or [[Single nucleotide polymorphism]])
* STR (or [[Short tandem repeat]])
* SFP (or [[Single feature polymorphism]])
* DArT (or [[Diversity Arrays Technology]])
* RAD markers (or [[Restriction site associated DNA markers]])

Molecular genetic markers can be divided into two classes a) biochemical markers which detect variation at the gene product level such as changes in proteins and amino acids and b) molecular markers which detect variation at the DNA level such as nucleotide changes: deletion, duplication, inversion and/or insertion. Markers can exhibit two modes of inheritance, i.e. dominant/recessive or co-dominant. If the genetic pattern of homozygotes can be distinguished from that of heterozygotes, then a marker is said to be co-dominant. Generally co-dominant markers are more informative than the dominant markers.&lt;ref name="Boopathi2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=N Manikanda Boopathi|title=Genetic Mapping and Marker Assisted Selection: Basics, Practice and Benefits|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YdOX0R8uUxgC&amp;pg=PA60|date=2012-12-12|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-81-322-0958-4|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Genetic markers can be used to study the relationship between an [[inherited disease]] and its [[Genetics|genetic]] cause (for example, a particular [[mutation]] of a [[gene]] that results in a defective [[protein]]). It is known that pieces of DNA that lie near each other on a chromosome tend to be inherited together. This property enables the use of a marker, which can then be used to determine the precise inheritance pattern of the gene that has not yet been exactly localized.

{{Anchor|uniparental marker}}
Genetic markers are employed in [[genealogical DNA test]]ing for [[genetic genealogy]] to determine [[genetic distance]] between individuals or populations. Uniparental markers (on [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] or [[Y chromosome|Y chromosomal]] DNA) are studied for assessing maternal or paternal [[lineage (genetic)|lineages]]. [[Autosome|Autosomal]] markers are used for all ancestry.

Genetic markers have to be easily identifiable, associated with a specific [[locus (genetics)|locus]], and highly [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphic]], because [[homozygotes]] do not provide any information. Detection of the marker can be direct by RNA sequencing, or indirect using [[allozyme]]s.

Some of the methods used to study the [[genome]] or [[phylogenetics]] are RFLP, [[Amplified fragment length polymorphism]] (AFLP), RAPD, SSR. They can be used to create genetic maps of whatever organism is being studied.

There was a debate over what the transmissible agent of [[CTVT]] ([[canine transmissible venereal tumor]]) was. Many researchers hypothesized that virus like particles were responsible for transforming the cell, while others thought that the cell itself was able to infect other canines as an [[allograft]]. With the aid of genetic markers, researchers were able to provide conclusive evidence that the cancerous tumor cell evolved into a transmissible parasite. Furthermore, molecular genetic markers were used to resolve the issue of natural transmission, the breed of origin ([[phylogenetics]]), and the age of the canine tumor.&lt;ref&gt;Murgia C, [[Jonathan K. Pritchard|Pritchard JK]], Kim SY, Fassati A, Weiss RA. Clonal origin and evolution of a transmissible cancer. Cell. 2006 Aug 11;126(3):477-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic markers have also been used to measure the genomic response to selection in livestock. Natural and artificial selection leads to a change in the genetic makeup of the cell. The presence of different alleles due to a distorted segregation at the genetic markers is indicative of the difference between selected and non-selected livestock.&lt;ref name="pmid12454081"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = Gomez-Raya L, Olsen HG, Lingaas F, Klungland H, Våge DI, Olsaker I, Talle SB, Aasland M, Lien S |title = The use of genetic markers to measure genomic response to selection in livestock |journal = Genetics |volume = 162 |issue = 3 |pages = 1381–8 |date = November 2002 |pmid = 12454081 |pmc = 1462338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3660">'''Grammar systems theory''' is a field of [[theoretical computer science]] that studies [[system]]s of finite collections of [[formal grammar]]s generating a [[formal language]]. Each grammar works on a string, a so-called ''sequential form'' that represents an environment. Grammar systems can thus be used as a formalization of decentralized or distributed systems of [[Intelligent agent|agents]] in [[artificial intelligence]].&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"&gt;

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; be a simple [[reactive agent]] moving on the table and trying not to fall down from the table with two reactions, ''t'' for turning and ''&amp;fnof;'' for moving forward. The set of possible behaviors of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; can then be described as [[formal language]]

: &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L_A}=\{(f^mt^nf^r)^+:1\leq m\leq k; 1\leq n\leq \ell;1\leq r\leq k\},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''&amp;fnof;'' can be done maximally ''k'' times and ''t'' can be done maximally ''ℓ'' times considering the dimensions of the table.&lt;ref name="kelemenjirku1996"&gt;

[[Image:Grammar system diagram.svg|thumb|450px|right|System of grammars sequentially rewriting shared string &lt;math&gt;w&lt;/math&gt;]] Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{G_A}&lt;/math&gt; be a formal grammar which generates language &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{L_A}&lt;/math&gt;. The behavior of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; is then described by this grammar. Suppose the &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{A}&lt;/math&gt; has a [[subsumption architecture]]; each component of this architecture can be then represented as a formal grammar too and the final behavior of the agent is then described by this ''system of grammars''.

The schema on the right describes such a system of grammars which shares a common string representing an environment. The shared sequential form is sequentially rewritten by each grammar, which can represent either a component or generally an agent.

If grammars communicate together and work on a shared sequential form, it is called a ''Cooperating Distributed (DC)'' grammar system. Shared sequential form is a similar concept to the blackboard approach in [[AI]],&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt; which is inspired by an idea of experts solving some problem together while they share their proposals and ideas on a shared blackboard.

Each grammar in a grammar system can also work on its own string and communicate with other grammars in a system by sending their sequential forms on request. Such a grammar system is then called a ''Parallel Communicating (PC)'' grammar system.&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

PC and DC are inspired by distributed AI.  If there is no communication between grammars, the system is close to the decentralized approaches in AI. These kinds of grammar systems are sometimes called ''colonies'' or ''Eco-Grammar'' systems, depending (besides others) on whether the environment is changing on its own (Eco-Grammar system) or not (colonies).&lt;ref name="gramsysdis"/&gt;

'''Gross examination''' or "grossing" is the process by which [[pathology]] specimens are inspected with the bare eye to obtain [[diagnosis|diagnostic]] information, while being processed for further [[histopathology|microscopic]] ''examination.''

Gross examination of [[surgical pathology|surgical specimens]] is typically performed by a [[pathology|pathologist]], or by a [[pathologists' assistant]] working within a pathology practice. Individuals trained in these fields are often able to gather diagnostically critical information in this stage of processing, including the stage and margin status of surgically removed tumors.

The initial step in any examination of a clinical specimen is confirmation of the identity of the [[patient]] and the [[anatomy|anatomical]] site from which the specimen was obtained. Sufficient clinical data should be communicated by the clinical team to the pathology team in order to guide the appropriate diagnostic examination and interpretation of the specimen - if such information is not provided, it must be obtained by the examiner prior to processing the specimen.

There are usually two end products of the gross examination of a surgical specimen. The first is the gross description, a document which serves as the written record of the examiner's findings, and is included in the final pathology report. The second product is a set of [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] blocks, typically postage stamp-sized portions of tissue sealed in plastic cassettes, which will be processed into slides for microscopic examination. Since only a minority of the tissue from a large specimen can reasonably be subject to microscopic examination, the success of the final [[histopathology|histological]] diagnosis is highly dependent on the skill of the professional performing the gross examination. The gross examiner may sample portions of the specimen for other types of ancillary tests as diagnostically indicated; these include [[microbiological culture]], [[flow cytometry]], [[cytogenetics]], or [[electron microscopy]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2179">The so-called '''Hamburg School of Art History''' (''Hamburger Schule der Kunstgeschichte'') was a school of art historians primarily teaching at the [[University of Hamburg]], who were closely connected with the ''Kulturwissenschaftliche Bibliothek Warburg'' (KBW) at the [[Warburg Haus, Hamburg]]. Its main members were scholars such as [[Aby Warburg]], [[Erwin Panofsky]], [[Fritz Saxl]] and [[Ernst Cassirer]], who had been schooled to see images as cultural documents and inculcated in the investigation of pictorial types.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Sears, "American Iconography: Assessing FSA Photographs, 1945", ''Visual Resources: An International Journal of Documentation'', Volume 30, Issue 3, 2014, pp. 239-254.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Hamburg School of Art History is celebrated for the theoretical interpretations of subject matter known as [[iconography]] and [[iconology]].

'''Integrative communication theory''' is a theory of cross-cultural adaptation proposed by [[Young Yun Kim]]. The first widely published version of Kim's theory is found in the last three chapters of a textbook authored by William Gudykunst with Young Yun Kim as second author.  See [[acculturation]] and [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]].  

==Background of integrative communication theory==
'''Young Yun Kim's''' assimilation Theory of Cross-Cultural Adaptation maintains that human transformation takes only one path, assimilative.  Kim argues that all human beings experience conformity as they move into a new and culturally unfamiliar environment and that they do so by "unlearning" who they were originally. The concept, cross-cultural adaptation, refers to a process in and through which an individual achieves an increasing level of psychological and functional fitness with respect to the receiving environment. Kim's theory postulates a zero-sum process whereby assimilation or "adaptation" occurs only to the extent that the newcomer lose the characteristics of their original cultural identity, such as language, customs, beliefs and values.  

Kim's theory however is self-contradictory for on one hand Kim argues that the newcomer "evolves" toward becoming exactly like the host majority by internalizing the majority's ways of thinking, feeling and behaving while unlearning their own.  But on the other hand Kim argues that out of this transformation emerges an ''intercultural identity,'' that somehow exists beyond all the contingencies of culture and language itself.  Kim claims that individuals that enter a new culture for varying lengths of time, and to include migrant workers, diplomats, and expatriates alike &lt;ref name="kim1988"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (1988).

It is important to note that this book is a trade paperback that has been out-of-print since 1988, that it is not an academic work and it is very difficult to find through interlibrary loan or anywhere&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kim2001"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (2001).

Adapting to a New Culture. In Gudykunst, W (Ed.), Theorizing about intercultural communication. [[Thousand Oaks, California]]: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Investigative efforts===
Kim's research into cross-cultural adaptation began in the 1970s through a survey of Korean immigrants in the Chicago area.  It subsequently expanded to study other immigrant and refugee groups in the United States to include American Indians, Japanese and Mexican Americans, and Southeast Asian refugees.  In addition to studying groups of immigrants, Young Yun Kim researched groups of students studying abroad in the United States, as well as international students in Japan, Korean expatriates in the United States and American expatriates in South Korea. The first outline of her theory was found in an article titled, "Toward an Interactive Theory of Communication - Acculturation",&lt;ref name="kim1979"&gt;Kim, Young Yun (1979). Toward an interactive theory of communication-acculturation. In B. Ruben (Ed.), Communication Yearbook 3, 435-453.&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a complete rendition of the theory in ''Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation:  An Integrative Theory'',&lt;ref name="kim1988"/&gt; which was further refined and updated with ''Becoming Intercultural:  An Integrative Theory of Communication and Cross-Cultural Adaptation''.&lt;ref name="kim2001"/&gt;

Kim states that there are five key "missing links" in [[cross-cultural]] adaptation literature, which her theory attempts to cover:{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

# Lack of attention to macro-level factors, such as the cultural and institutional patterns of the host environment
# Need to integrate the traditionally separate areas of investigation of long-term and short-term adaptation
# Cross cultural adaptation must be viewed in the context of new learning and psychological growth to provide a more balanced and complete interpretation of the experiences of individuals in an unfamiliar environment
# Efforts must be made to sort and consolidate the factors constituting and/or explaining the cross-cultural adaptation process of individuals
# Divergent ideological premises of assimilationalism and pluralism need to be recognized and incorporated into a pragmatic conception of cross-cultural adaptation as a condition of the host environment as well as of the individual adapting to that environment.

===Organizing principles===
*Adaptation as a Natural and Universal Phenomenon
**The theory of integrative communication rests on the human instinct to struggle for equilibrium when met with adversarial environmental conditions as experienced in a new culture.  This experience is not limited to any one region, cultural group, or nation, but is a universal concept of the basic human tendencies that accompany the struggle on each individual when they are faced with a new and challenging environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
*Adaptation as an All-Encompassing Phenomenon
**Before efforts at racial and cultural integration in the United States, the main thrust was assimilation.  The stress was on the ideology of the "model minority" which states that the only standard for "appropriate," "effective," and "competent" thinking (cognition), feeling (affect), and behavior (functional fit) was a presumed majority mainstream culture.  The immigrant newcomer was compelled to internalize mainstream ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving or be marginalized.  Beginning even before World War II and certainly after, efforts at racial and ethnic integration grew dramatically and the model minority ideology became untenable (Kramer, 2003 &lt;ref&gt;Kramer, E. (Ed.) (2003). ''The Emerging Monoculture: Assimilation and the "Model Minority"''. Westport, CT: Praeger&lt;/ref&gt;).  But even into the twenty-first century we see remnants of it.  An example is Young Yun Kim's cross-cultural adaptation theory.  Borrowing extensively from Gordon and Park's work, especially Milton Gordon's 1954 book ''Assimilation in American Life'' where he outlines seven stages in the assimilative process, Kim presents a reiteration of the 1950s era notion in her theory of cross-cultural adaptation as a multi-staged process.  The theory focuses on the unitary nature of psychological and social processes and the reciprocal functional personal environment interdependence.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  This view takes into account micro-psychological and macro-social factors into a theoretical fusion "vertical integration" of theory.  While cross-cultural adaptation theory itself is a fusion of previous ideas, it is not about racial or ethnic integration but instead assimilation.  And as such it is unlike the works of Bateson, Ruesch and Bateson, Watzlawick Beavin, and Jackson, and Buss and Kenrick&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; Kim's approach is unilinear.  The sojourner must conform to the majority group culture in order to be "communicatively competent."  Gudykunst and Kim (2003)&lt;ref&gt;Gudykunst, W. &amp; Kim, Y. Y. (2003). Communicating with strangers: An approach to intercultural communication, 4th ed. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; equate integration, adaptation and assimilation writing, "cross-cultural adaptation process involves a continuous interplay of deculturation and acculturation that brings about change in strangers in the direction of assimilation, the highest degree of adaptation theoretically conceivable" (p.&amp;nbsp;360).  In biological science adaptation means the random mutation of new forms of life, not convergence on a single form or monoculture (Kramer, 2003).  The term adaptation is used by Gudykunst and Kim to mean simple conformity to the coercive power (pp.&amp;nbsp;360,371) of what they call a single form of "mainstream culture" with its "objective" "external" reality (p.&amp;nbsp;378) -- "what is real, what is true, what is right, what is beautiful, and what is good" (p.&amp;nbsp;376).  As they define reality, the newcomer's perspective is false, a delusion or "self-deception" (p.&amp;nbsp;380) and any attempt to maintain one's original false values, beliefs, ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitute the mental illness of "maladaptation" (p.&amp;nbsp;372).  According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the way of "upward-forward" (p.&amp;nbsp;382) evolution toward functional fitness and psychological health is for the newcomer to willfully "unlearn" and "deculturize" (p.&amp;nbsp;380) herself.  They propose psychotherapy as well as the abandonment of all ethnic relations and associations with ethnic ties as well as avoidance of "ethnic media" use (pp.&amp;nbsp;365–368) to help immigrants (p.&amp;nbsp;382) achieve "integrative" conformity.  This is not ecological integration but simple disintegration of the newcomer until their identity is erased.  According to Gudykunst and Kim (2003) the more the newcomer is disintegrated the better, even if it leads to extreme distress for the immigrant.  As Gudykunst and Kim (2003) put it, "Even extreme mental illness [caused by "conformity pressure" p.&amp;nbsp;371] can be viewed as a process of a potentially positive disintegration that will be reintegrated with new material at a higher level" (p.&amp;nbsp;381).  No matter how unjust or cruel, Gudykunst and Kim (2003) argue that the host way of thinking, feeling, and behaving constitutes the "higher level" of psychic evolution and any resistance to pressure to conform, to disintegration on the part of a minority person indicates that the immigrant is communicatively incompetent, immature (p.&amp;nbsp;381), mentally ill (pp.&amp;nbsp;365, 372-373, 376), weak (p.&amp;nbsp;369), irrationally aggressive or hostile (pp.&amp;nbsp;371, 376), lacking in self-control (p.&amp;nbsp;369), cynical (p.&amp;nbsp;380), pessimistic (p.&amp;nbsp;369), closed-minded (p.&amp;nbsp;369), simple minded (pp.&amp;nbsp;382–383) and "ethnocentric" (pp.&amp;nbsp;376, 382).  Evolutionary progress for the individual requires the individual to "abandon identification with the cultural patterns that have constituted who one is and what one is" (p.&amp;nbsp;377).  These patterns are not just behavioral but "appropriate" ways of thinking as defined by the majority mainstream reality.

Grace (Ed.), ''Comparative Cultures and Civilizations (Vol. 3)''. Cresskill, NJ: Hampton.&lt;/ref&gt;) maintains clear conceptual separation between assimilation, adaptation, and integration. Only assimilation involves conformity to a pre-existing form. Kramer's (2000a, 2000b, 2000c, 2003, 2009, 2011) theory of Cultural Fusion, which is based on systems theory and hermeneutics, argues that first it is impossible for a person to unlearn themselves and second that "growth" is, by definition, not a zero sum process that requires the disillusion of one form for another to come into being but rather a process of learning new languages and cultural repertoires (ways of thinking, cooking, playing, working worshipping, and so forth).  One need not unlearn a language in order to learn a new one.  Nor does one have to unlearn who one is in order to learn new ways of dancing, cooking, talking and so forth.  Cognitive complexity involves the ability to code switch between repertoires, not a zero growth, zero-sum process as Gudykunst and Kim claim (2003, p 383).  Learning is growth, not unlearning.
*Adaptation as a Communication-Based Phenomenon
**A person begins to adapt only as they communicate with others in their new environment.  Integration relies on that interaction with the host society and the degree to which an individual adapts depends on the amount and nature of communication with members of the host society.
*Theory as a System of Description and Explanation
**The present theory is designed to identify the patterns that are commonly present within a clearly defined set of individual cases and to translate these patterns into a set of generalized and interrelated statements.  The fact that humans will adapt in a new environment was not questioned, but rather how and why individuals adapt.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
*Theorizing at the Interface of Deduction and Induction
**Kim's research has switched between deductive and inductive processes – between the conceptual realm of logical development of ideas from a set of basic assumptions about human adaptation and empirical substantiation of the ideas based on proofs available in social science literature.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  In her research, Kim introduced anecdotal stories and testimonials of immigrants and sojourners available in non-technical sources such as reports, biographies, letters, diaries, dialogues, commentaries, and other materials in magazines, newspapers, fiction and nonfiction books, radio programs, and televisions programs.   These individual accounts are not scientific data, but rather serve as a vital source of insights into the "lived experiences" of cross cultural adaptation.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
*Focal Concepts and Boundary Conditions
**Kim employs two central terms in Integrative Communication Theory, [[adaptation]] and [[wiktionary:stranger|stranger]], in order to help define the theory.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;  Stranger incorporates in it all individuals who enter and resettle in a new cultural or sub-cultural environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

==Process of cross-cultural adaptation==
All human beings are born into an unfamiliar environment and are brought up to become part of a culture.  This process is known as [[enculturation]], and refers to the organization, integration, and maintenance of a home environment throughout the formative years along with the internal change that occurs with increasing interaction of the individual in its cultural environment. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Entering a new culture===
The transition into a new culture can be shocking, and internal conflicts often arise.  The individual must learn to adapt and grow into the new environment, as they are often faced with situations that challenge their cultural norms and worldview.  This is the process known as [[acculturation]] as described by Shibutani and Kwan in 1965.  According to Kim, as new learning occurs, deculturation or unlearning of some of the old cultural elements has to occur, at least in the sense that new responses are adopted in situations that previously would have evoked old ones.  The individual is forced to develop new habits, which may come in conflict with the old ones. Kim states that the ultimate theoretical directionality of adaptive change is toward [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], a state of the maximum possible convergence of strangers' internal and external conditions to those of the natives.  Assimilation is an ongoing process and is not usually fully attained, regardless of the amount of time spent in the new culture.

Integrative communication theory suggests that these varying levels of integration within a culture directly impact the individual's experience in the new culture, which other research suggests.  According to '''Don C. Locke''', one major difference among members of various cultural groups within America is the degree to which they have immersed themselves into the culture of the United States.  He states that members of culturally diverse groups can be placed into several categories.  Bicultural individuals are able to function as competently in the dominant culture as their own while holding on to manifestations of their own culture.  Traditional individuals hold on to a majority of cultural traits from the culture of origin and reject many traits of the dominant culture.  A third type of individual will acculturate and give up most cultural traits of the culture of origin and traits of the dominant culture.  Finally, a marginal individual does not fit into the culture of origin nor into the dominant culture.&lt;ref name="locke"&gt;Locke, D (1998). Increasing Multicultural Understanding. Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The stress-adaptation-growth dynamic===
Kim has developed an integrative communication theory of cross-cultural adaptation which conceives adaptation as a [[dialectic]] process of the "stress-adaptation-growth" dynamic that gradually leads to greater functional fitness and psychological health with regards to the host environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; This portion of Kim's theory focuses on the [[Stress (biological)|stress]] that inevitably accompanies a cross-cultural move, as the individual strives to retain aspects of their old culture while also attempting to integrate into the new one.  The internal conflict that arises results in a state of disequilibrium of emotional "lows" of uncertainty confusion, and anxiety.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}
People handle this change in various ways, to include avoidance, denial, and withdrawal, as well as regression into pre-existing habits in order to eliminate discomfort in the new environment. Others develop new habits and begin the process of [[adaptation]], allowing them to become better suited to their environment.  Once this occurs, a period of growth often accompanies.  The stress adaptation growth dynamic, therefore, is not a linear process but a back and forth endeavor that will entail periods of regression and subsequent progression. Assimilation can be defined as the process by which a person takes material into their mind from the environment, which may mean changing the evidence of their senses to make it fit, whereas accommodation is the difference made to one's mind or concepts by the process of assimilation.&lt;ref name="atherton"&gt;Atherton J.S. (2005) Learning and Teaching:  Piaget's developmental theory.  Retrieved May 2, 2008, from http://www.learningandteaching.info/learning/piaget.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The structure of cross-cultural adaptation==

===Personal communication: host communication competence===
Communication is a prerequisite for successful adaptation of individuals into a new environment.  This relies on [[Code|decoding]], or the capacity of strangers to receive and process information, as well as [[encoding]], or the designing and executing mental plans in initiating or responding to messages.
There are three commonly recognized categories:
#Cognitive: Includes such internal capabilities as the knowledge of the host culture and language, history, institutions, worldviews, beliefs, norms, and rules of interpersonal conduct.
#Affective: Affective competence facilitates cross-cultural adaptation by providing a motivational capacity to deal with various challenges of living in the host environment, the openness to new learning, and the willingness to participate in emotional and physical aspects of the host environment.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;
#Operational: Operational competence relates to the other aspects of host communication competence and facilitates strangers' outwardly expressing their cognitive and affective experiences.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Host social communication===
Participation in the interpersonal and [[mass communication]] activities of the host society is crucial. '''Host interpersonal communication''' helps strangers to secure vital information and insight into the mind-sets and behaviors of the local people, thereby providing strangers a reference point for their own behaviors,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} while '''host mass communication''' relies on integrating the individual into the host society via media, radio, television, etc...and serves as an important source of cultural and language learning without relying heavily on individual participation and exposure.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Ethnic social communication===
In the initial phase of integration, ethnic communities serve to allow strangers to receive some of the comforts of their previous culture, and serve to facilitate adaptation.  After the initial phase, ethnic social communication allows individuals to maintain connectedness to their original culture. {{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Environment===
Some cultures make it easier to assimilate than others, and the host environment has a direct impact on the nature of an individual's integration.  Some societies display more openness and warmth to outsiders than others.  The degree to which a given host environment exerts receptivity and conformity pressure on a stranger is closely influenced by the overall ethnic group strength, which is a measure of a given stranger's ethnic group's capacity to influence the surrounding host environment at large.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt;

===Predisposition===
An individual can better prepare themselves to enter a new environment, both physically and emotionally, which will have a positive effect on their ability to transition.  This takes into account the mental, emotional, and motivational readiness to deal with the new environment, including understanding of the new language and culture.&lt;ref name="kim2005"/&gt; Having an open mind helps to alleviate some of the [[culture shock]] that is associated with assimilation into the new environment.

[[File:Crops are harvested in fields at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, or ICARDA, site in Terbol, Bekaa Valley. (J.jpg|thumb|right|Crops are harvested in fields at the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, or ICARDA, site in Terbol, Bekaa Valley.]]
The '''International Center for Agriculture Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA)''', a member of the [[CGIAR]], supported by the CGIAR Fund, is a non-profit agricultural research institute that aims to improve the livelihoods of the resource-poor across the world's dry areas.
   
ICARDA has been temporarily headquartered in [[Beirut|Beirut, Lebanon]], since leaving [[Aleppo|Aleppo, Syria]] in 2012. Support is provided by research centers and offices in Jordan, Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, Turkey, Afghanistan, India, Iran, Oman, Pakistan, Sudan, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates, and Yemen.

Established in 1977, ICARDA's origins lie in a 1973 study that highlighted the [[food security]] challenges faced by countries across the dry regions of the Near East and North Africa. ICARDA research activities include the development of new crop varieties, [[water harvesting]], [[conservation agriculture]], the diversification of production systems, [[integrated crop production|integrated crop]]/rangeland/livestock production systems, and the [[empowerment of rural women]].

==Research Programs==
[[File:A seed bank in the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, or ICARDA, site in Bekaa Valley holds around 40,000 seed samples — compared to 150,000 in Syria.jpg|thumb|left|A seed bank in the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas, or ICARDA, site in Bekaa Valley holds around 40,000 seed samples — compared to 150,000 in Syria]]

===Biodiversity and Integrated Gene Management===
The Biodiversity and Integrated Gene Management Program works to conserve agricultural biodiversity in dry areas and to use these resources to improve food security, nutrition, and livelihoods through breeding. It covers [[durum]] and [[Common wheat|bread wheat]], [[barley]], [[chickpea]], [[lentil]], [[Vicia faba|faba bean]], [[Lathyrus sativus|grasspea]], and forage and pasture crops. ICARDA scientists work on [[Conservation biology|biodiversity conservation]] as well as crop improvement. Activities take both conventional and biotechnological approaches, and include integrated disease and pest management, and seed production and delivery systems to enhance the adoption of new varieties.

===Integrated Water and Land Management===
The Water and Land Management program aims to improve the management of scarce water resources, and to combat desertification and [[land degradation]]. ICARDA scientists develop technical, institutional, and policy options for improved water productivity in both rainfed and irrigated production systems; for sustainable, equitable, and economic use of all water sources; and for improved land management and drought mitigation. Research focuses on appropriate, effective technologies, such as [[Deficit irrigation|supplemental irrigation]] and [[rainwater harvesting]].

===Diversification and Sustainable Intensification of Production Systems===
The Diversification and Sustainable Intensification of Production Systems Program focuses on improving livelihoods, and reducing risk by intensifying and diversifying traditional production systems. Research covers agronomy, integrated crop-livestock-rangeland systems, market linkages, supporting diversification into higher value crops, and creating new income opportunities through value adding to crop and livestock products.

===Social, Economic, and Policy Research===
The Social, Economic, and Policy Research Program aims to better understand rural poverty, livelihood strategies, and gender and youth issues to improve the targeting of research and development investments and accelerate technology adoption. Activities include poverty mapping, value-chain and market analysis, and policy and institutional options in agriculture. Adoption and impact studies help identify barriers to the adoption of new technologies, provide lessons for the design of research and development programs, and provide quantitative evidence of the returns to research investments.

==Decentralization==
ICARDA's decentralization builds on the Center's existing organization. Staff have been relocated to Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Ethiopia, Egypt, Tunisia, and Turkey, and the Center has established temporary headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon.

===Integrated Research Platforms===
As part of its decentralization, ICARDA has established integrated research platforms that address research priorities in each region, but serve dry areas globally through collaboration and partnerships with national programs, advanced research institutions, and other partners in the development and dissemination of international public goods.

The Center has developed four major Platforms, including the headquarters:

'''Headquarters (West Asia):''' ICARDA has established temporary headquarters in Beirut, Lebanon, and expanded facilities and activities in Lebanon, Turkey and Jordan. Syria and Jordan also host a CRP Dryland Systems Action Site.

'''North Africa, with a Platform in Morocco:''' Building on the existing partnership with INRA (Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique), and focused on the intensification and diversification of rainfed cereal-based production systems. Morocco also hosts a CRP Dryland Systems Action Site.

'''Sub-Saharan Africa, with a Platform in Ethiopia:''' Building on the partnership with [[International Livestock Research Institute|ILRI]] in the CRP on Livestock and Fish and on-going collaboration with the [[Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research]] (EIAR). Ethiopia also hosts a CRP Dryland Systems Action Site.

'''South Asia, with a Platform in India:''' Building on the existing partnership with ICAR ([[Indian Council of Agricultural Research]]), and focused especially on food legumes systems. India also hosts two CRP Dryland Systems Action Sites.

===Thematic research locations===

Under ICARDA's decentralization strategy, the Center is operating four additional research locations with specific themes:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24303">The '''International Chemistry Olympiad''' ('''IChO''') is an annual academic competition for high school students. It is one of the [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

The first IChO was held in [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1968. The event has been held every year since then, with the exception of 1971. The delegations that attended the first events were mostly countries of the former [[Eastern bloc]] and it was not until 1980, the 12th annual International Chemistry Olympiad, that the event was held outside of the bloc in [[Austria]].  Up to 4 students for each national team compete around July in both a theoretical and an experimental sections, with about half of the participants being awarded medals.

==Structure and rules==   
[[File:IChO medal.jpg|thumb|An International Chemistry Olympiad medal for 29th IChO, held at [[Montreal]], [[Canada]].]]

Each delegation consists of up to four students and two mentors (one of them is designated as the head of the delegation or "head mentor"). A delegation may also include a handful of guests and scientific observers. Students must be under the age of 20 and must not be enrolled as regular students in any post-secondary education institution. The International Information Center of the International Chemistry Olympiad is based in [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]].

Countries who wish to participate in the IChO must send observers to two consecutive olympiads before their students can participate in the event. A total of 68 countries took part in the 38th IChO in 2006: 67 as participants and 1 as an observer. In 2017 more than 80 countries are expected to send students.

The competition consists of two examinations, a theoretical examination and a practical examination. Both have durations of up to 5 hours, and are held on separate days with the practical examination usually being before the theoretical examination. The theoretical examination has a value of 60 points and the practical examination has a value of 40 points. Each examination is evaluated independently from the other and the sum of the results of the examinations determines a participant's overall result. A scientific jury, which is installed by the host country, suggests the tasks. The international jury, which consists of the 2 mentors from each of the participating countries, discusses the competition tasks and translates them into the language of their students' preference.

Students receive the examinations translated into their languages of preference. It is the duty of the mentors to translate the examinations from English before they are given to the participants. After the examinations are held and evaluated by a committee appointed by the host country and before awards are presented, mentors discuss the evaluation of the exams with judges of the committee to assure fairness in their evaluation. Because the mentors review the examinations before they are given to participants, any communication between the mentors and the students is strictly forbidden prior to the completion of both exams, and the students are required to surrender any mobile phones and laptop computers to the organizer.

The syllabus of the competition contains subjects from several areas of [[chemistry]], including [[organic chemistry]], [[inorganic chemistry]], [[physical chemistry]], [[analytical chemistry]], [[biochemistry]], and [[spectroscopy]]. Though some of these subjects are included in most secondary school chemistry programs, for the most part, they are evaluated at a much deeper level and many may require a level of knowledge and understanding comparable to that of post-secondary education. In addition, the host country of each IChO issues a set of preparatory problems well in advance of the competition every year. These preparatory problems cover specific topics in considerable more depth than typical post-secondary education. Preparation for the International Chemistry Olympiad demands a high level of understanding and interest in chemistry and an outstanding ability to relate chemical subjects with one another as well as with the practical world.

[[File:Medali Emas Kelvin.jpg|thumb|A gold medal from the 40th IChO]]
All participants are ranked based on their individual scores and no official team scores are given. Gold medals are awarded to approximately the top 10% of students, silver medals are awarded to approximately the next 20% of students, and bronze medals are awarded approximately to the next 30% of students. The exact number of medals is decided on the blind review of the results. Honorable mentions are awarded to the next top 10% of the participants that do not win a medal. One special award is given to the student that achieves the highest score overall.  Two separate special awards are given to the students who get the best score in the theoretical and practical examinations.

These events are also outstanding opportunities for the students to meet people from all around the world who share similar interests, to visit different places, and to get in touch with different cultures. As the aims of the competition establish, ''the IChO competitions help to enhance friendly relations among young people from different countries; they encourage cooperation and international understanding''.

==Preparation==
While each country is free to choose its team by whatever means it seems appropriate, the selection process usually involves holding regional and national olympiad competitions. Many countries hold "training camps" for its top students, where mentors from the country give the students accelerated college-level courses in chemistry with an emphasis on the topics covered in that year's preparatory problems as well as practical training. It is agreed that such training programs must not exceed a total duration of two weeks but there are allegations every year that some countries exceed this limit by months or even years. Another concern is that some countries tend to bring the same students to the competition year after year, which helps them win better medals. Although some believe that this is against the spirit of the olympiad, many nations find it hard to justify leaving their best students at home.

==History==
The idea of the International Chemistry Olympiad was developed in the former Czechoslovakia in 1968. It was designed with the aim to increase the number of international contacts and the exchange of information between nations. Invitations were sent by the Czechoslovak national committee to all [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, except Romania (due to political issues between Romania and USSR). However, in May 1968, relations between Czechoslovakia and the Soviet Union became so delicate that only Poland and Hungary participated in the first international competition.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icho39.chem.msu.ru/html/english/IChO/History.htm |title=39th INTERNATIONAL CHEMISTRY OLYMPIAD |publisher=Icho39.chem.msu.ru |date= |accessdate=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first International Chemistry Olympiad took place in Prague between 18 and 21 June 1968. Each of the three participating countries sent a team of six students, and four theoretical tasks were to be solved. Guidelines for the next competitions were already suggested. The second chemistry Olympiad took place in 1969 in Poland, and Bulgaria also participated, with USSR and GDR only sending observers. Each team consisted of five pupils, and an experimental competition was added. The decision was made to invite more socialist countries to future competitions and to limit the number of pupils to four. The third Olympiad in 1970 was organized in Hungary with the GDR, Romania and the Soviet Union as new countries. In this competition, more than three prizes were distributed for the first time.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

There was no Olympiad held in 1971, as at the end of the competition in 1970, an organizer and host for the next event could not be agreed on. This was solved for the next three years by diplomatically agreeing on the Soviet Union to host 1972, Bulgaria in 1973, and Romania in 1974, starting the tradition to decide the host years in advance.. 1972 was the first time where preparation tasks for the International Chemistry Olympiad were created. Also, at a jury session, it was suggested that invitations should be sent to Vietnam, Mongolia, and Cuba. Unfortunately though, these invitations were not sent, leaving seven to compete in 1973.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

In 1974, Romania invited Sweden and Yugoslavia to the Olympiad in Bucharest and Germany and Austria sent observers. The Federal Republic of Germany was the first NATO-country with an observer present and this was only able to occur because the Brandt government had contracts in the East. Thus, in 1975, West Germany, Austria, and Belgium also participated in the International Chemistry Olympiad.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

The first Olympiad in a non-socialist country took place 1980 in Linz in Austria, although the Soviet Union did not participate. Since then the number of the participating countries has increased steadily. In 1980, only 13 nations took part but this number increased to 21 by the 1984 Olympiad in Frankfurt/Main. With [[revolutions of 1989|the fall of the Iron Curtain]] and the break-up of the Soviet Union into independent states in the early 1990s, the number of participants increased again. In addition, the increasing interest of Asian and Latin American countries became apparent with the numbers of participants. Altogether 47 delegations participated in 1998.  Presently, 75 countries participate in the International Chemistry Olympiad.&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29008">The name '''Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris''' (followed by a number), the abbreviation '''JPL DE'''(number), or just '''DE'''(number) designates one of a series of [[Computer simulation|models]] of the [[Solar system|Solar System]] produced at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]] in [[Pasadena, California]], primarily for purposes of spacecraft navigation and astronomy. The models consist of computer representations of [[Position (vector)|positions]], [[Velocity|velocities]] and [[acceleration]]s of major Solar System bodies, tabulated at equally spaced intervals of time, covering a specified span of years. [[center of mass|Barycentric]] [[Cartesian coordinate system|rectangular coordinates]] of the [[Sun]], eight major [[planet]]s and [[Pluto]], and geocentric coordinates of the [[Moon]] are tabulated.

DE405, created in May 1997, include both [[nutation]]s and [[libration]]s, and is considered the fundamental planetary and lunar ephemerides of The [[Astronomical Almanac]].  It is very large at 62.4 Megabytes, so smaller, more targeted versions have been created based on DE405.

== History ==
There have been many versions of the '''JPL DE''', from the 1960s through the present,&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{cite web |url=http://naca.larc.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19680002127&amp;qs=Ns%3DPublication-Date%7c0%26N%3D4294828771 |title=JPL Development Ephemeris Number 28 |author=Lieske |date=1967 |work=JPL Technical Report 32-1206}}; {{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19700021709_1970021709.pdf |title=JPL Development Ephemeris Number 69 |author=O'Handley |display-authors=etal |date=1969 |work=JPL Technical Report 32-1465}}; {{Cite journal|title=JPL Development Ephemeris number 96 |author=Standish |display-authors=etal |date=1976|bibcode = 1976jden.book.....S}}; see also Newhall, Standish and Williams (1983).&lt;/ref&gt; in support of both robotic and manned&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19740075866_1974075866.pdf |title=Estimated DE19 Lunar Ephemeris Errors for the Apollo 15 Mission |author=York |date=1971 |work=NASA MSC Internal Note 71-FM-291}}&lt;/ref&gt; spacecraft missions. Available documentation is sketchy, but we know '''DE69''' was announced in 1969 to be the third release of the JPL Ephemeris Tapes, and was a special purpose, short-duration ephemeris. The then-current JPL Export Ephemeris was '''DE19'''. These early releases were distributed on [[magnetic tape]].

In the days before personal computers, computers were large and expensive, and numerical integrations such as these were run by large organizations with ample resources. The JPL ephemerides prior to '''DE405''' were integrated on a [[Univac]] mainframe in [[Double-precision floating-point format|double precision]]. For instance, '''DE102''', which was created in 1977, took six million steps and ran for nine days on a [[UNIVAC 1100/2200 series|Univac 1100/81]].&lt;ref name="nsw1983" /&gt; '''DE405''' was integrated on a [[DEC Alpha]] in [[Quadruple-precision floating-point format|quadruple precision]].&lt;ref&gt;See Standish and Williams in the '''Sources'''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, much work was done in the astronomical community to update the astronomical almanacs from the [[Newcomb's Tables of the Sun|theoretical work of the 1890s]] to modern, relativistic theory. From 1975 through 1982, six ephemerides were produced at JPL using the modern techniques of least-squares adjustment of numerically-integrated output to high precision data: '''DE96''' in Nov. 1975, '''DE102''' in Sep. 1977, '''DE111''' in May 1980, '''DE118''' in Sep. 1981, and '''DE200''' in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1990A&amp;A...233..252S |last=Standish |first=E. M., Jr. |title=The observational basis for JPL's DE 200, the planetary ephemerides of the Astronomical Almanac |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=233 |issue=1 |date=July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''DE102''' was the first numerically integrated so-called Long Ephemeris, covering much of history for which useful astronomical observations were available: 1141 BC to AD 3001. '''DE200''', a version of '''DE118''' migrated to the [[Epoch (astronomy)|J2000.0 reference frame]], was adopted as the [[fundamental ephemeris]] for the new almanacs starting in 1984. DE402 introduced coordinates referred to the [[International Celestial Reference Frame]] (ICRF).

The JPL ephemerides have been the basis of the [[Astronomical Almanac]] since 1981's  DE200.  The current (2016) Almanac is derived from '''DE430'''.&lt;ref name="USNO" /&gt;

== Construction ==
Each [[ephemeris]] was produced by [[numerical integration]] of the [[equations of motion]], starting from a set of initial conditions.  Due to the precision of modern observational data, the [[Analytical mechanics|analytical]] method of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|general perturbations]] could no longer be applied to a high enough accuracy to adequately reproduce the observations. The method of [[Perturbation (astronomy)|special perturbations]] was applied, using numerical integration to [[Equation solving|solve]] the [[N-body problem|''n''-body problem]], in effect putting the entire Solar System into motion in the computer's memory, accounting for all relevant physical laws. The initial conditions were both constants such as [[planetary mass]]es, from outside sources, and parameters such as initial positions and velocities, adjusted to produce output which was a "best fit" to a large set of [[observation]]s. A [[Least squares|least-squares]] technique was used to perform the fitting.&lt;ref name="nsw1983" /&gt; As of DE421, perturbations from 343 asteroids, representing about 90% of the mass of the [[Asteroid belt|main asteroid belt]], have been included in the dynamical model.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-196/196C.pdf|title=The Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides, DE430 and DE431|last=Folkner|first=William|date=February 15, 2014|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physics modeled included the mutual [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian]] gravitational accelerations and their [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism|relativistic corrections]] (a modified form of the [[Einstein–Infeld–Hoffmann equations|Einstein-Infeld-Hoffmann equation]]), the [[Tidal acceleration|accelerations caused by the tidal distortion]] of the Earth, the accelerations caused by the [[figure of the Earth]] and Moon, and a model of the lunar [[libration]]s.&lt;ref name="nsw1983"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Newhall |first=X. X. |last2=Standish |first2=E. M. |last3=Williams |first3=J. G. |date=1983 |title=DE 102 - A numerically integrated ephemeris of the moon and planets spanning forty-four centuries |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=125 |issue=1 |pages=150 |bibcode=1983A&amp;A...125..150N }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The observational data in the fits has been an evolving set, including: ranges (distances) to planets measured by radio signals from spacecraft,&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|url=http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/Monograph/series1/Descanso1_all.pdf |title=Radiometric Tracking Techniques for Deep-Space Navigation |author=Thornton and Border |date=2000 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218224943/http://descanso.jpl.nasa.gov/Monograph/series1/Descanso1_all.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-18 |df= }} for a good summary of spacecraft radio-navigation.&lt;/ref&gt; direct [[Radar astronomy|radar-ranging]] of planets, two-dimensional position fixes (on the plane of the sky) by [[VLBI]] of spacecraft, [[Transit circle|transit]] and [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] telescopic observations of planets and small bodies, and [[Lunar laser ranging|laser-ranging]] of [[retroreflector]]s on the Moon, among others. '''DE102''', for instance, was fit to 48,479 observations.

The time argument of the integrated ephemerides is a [[Coordinate time|relativistic coordinate time]] scale called [[Ephemeris time#JPL ephemeris time argument Teph|T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;]],&lt;ref&gt;See sources cited at [[Ephemeris time#JPL ephemeris time argument T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt;|JPL ephemeris time argument Teph]].&lt;/ref&gt; necessary in precise work to account for the small [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] effects of [[time dilation]] and [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]]. In later ephemerides, T&lt;sub&gt;eph&lt;/sub&gt; is essentially equivalent to the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]] definition of [[Barycentric Coordinate Time|TCB]].

== Distribution ==
Positions and velocities of the Sun, Earth, Moon, and planets, along with the orientation of the Moon, are stored as [[Chebyshev polynomials|Chebyshev polynomial coefficients]] fit in 32-day-long segments.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  The ephemerides are now available via World Wide Web and FTP&lt;ref&gt;See the [ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ JPL FTP site] with ephemerides (data files), source code (for access and basic processing of the data to recover positions and velocities), and documentation.&lt;/ref&gt; as data files containing the Chebyshev coefficients, along with source code to recover (calculate) positions and velocities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;See JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides Export Information [ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/README.txt README.txt version of 12 Oct 2007]. Also available is an older version [http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html README.txt version of December 6, 2005] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115000000/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |date=January 15, 2012 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Files vary in the time periods they cover, ranging from a few hundred years to several thousand, and bodies they include. Data may be based on each planet's true center or its [[barycenter]].

The use of Chebyshev polynomials enables highly precise calculations for a given point in time.  '''DE405''' recovery (calculation) for the [[inner planet]]s is about 0.001 [[Minute of arc|arcseconds]] (equivalent to about 1&amp;nbsp;km at the distance of [[Mars]]); for the [[outer planet]]s it is generally about 0.1 arcseconds.  The 'reduced accuracy' '''DE406''' ephemeris gives an interpolating precision (relative to the full ephemeris values) no worse than 25&amp;nbsp;metres for any planet and no worse than 1&amp;nbsp;metre for the moon.

Note that these precision numbers are for the interpolated values relative original tabulated coordinates. The overall precision and accuracy of interpolated values for describing the actual motions of the planets will be a function of both the precision of the ephemeris tabulated coordinates and the precision of the interpolation.

== Applications ==
*JPL uses the ephemerides for navigation of spacecraft throughout the Solar System. Typically, a new ephemeris is computed including the latest available observations of the target planet(s), either for planning of the mission(s), or for final contact of the spacecraft with the target. See below, [[#Recent ephemerides in the series|Recent ephemerides in the series]].
*The [[Astronomical Almanac]] for 1984 through 2002 were based on JPL ephemeris '''DE200''', and from 2003 to 2014 the Astronomical Almanac was based on JPL ephemeris '''DE405'''.&lt;ref name="USNO"&gt;See US Naval Observatory (Naval Oceanography Portal), [http://aa.usno.navy.mil/publications/docs/asa_history.php "History of the Astronomical Almanac"] (accessed September 2017); see also Standish (1998) for details of DE405.&lt;/ref&gt; The current Almanac is derived from '''DE430'''.
*The JPL ephemerides are widely used for planetary science; some examples are included in the [[#Notes and references|Notes and References]].
*Software is available to use the JPL ephemerides for the production of apparent ephemerides for any location and time; these are widely used by professional and amateur astronomers for reducing planetary observations and producing very precise observing guides.&lt;ref&gt;See the NASA [http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/index.html SPICE] system.&lt;/ref&gt;
*DE430 and DE431 can be used with the popular planetarium software [[Stellarium (software)|Stellarium]]

'''DE102''' was created in 1981, includes nutations but not librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 1950. Covers JED 1206160.5 (-1410 APR 16) to JED 2817872.5 (3002 DEC 22).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''DE200''' was created in 1981; includes nutations but not librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 2000. Covers JED 2305424.5 (1599 DEC 09) to JED 2513360.5 (2169 MAR 31). This ephemeris was used for the [[Astronomical Almanac]] from 1984 to 2003.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''DE202''' was created in 1987; includes nutations and librations. Referred to the dynamical equator and equinox of 2000. Covers JED 2414992.5 (1899 DEC 04) to JED 2469808.5 (2050 JAN 02).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''DE402''' was released in 1995, and was quickly superseded by DE403.

'''DE403'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de403iom/de403iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides, DE403/LE403 |author=Standish |display-authors=etal |date=1995 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 314.10-127 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811081430/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de403iom/de403iom.pdf |archivedate=August 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was created 1993, released in 1995. F JPL ephemeris was expressed in the coordinates of the [[IERS|International Earth Rotation Service]] (IERS) reference frame, essentially the ICRF. The data crunched by JPL to derive the ephemeris began to move away from limited-accuracy telescopic observations and more toward higher-accuracy [[radar astronomy|radar-ranging]] of the planets, radio-ranging of spacecraft, and [[VLBI|very-long-baseline-interferometric]] (VLBI) observations of spacecraft, especially for the four inner planets. Telescopic observations remained important for the outer planets because of their distance, hence the inability to bounce radar off of them, and the difficulty of parking a spacecraft near them. The [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbations]] of 300 asteroids were included, vs DE118/DE200 which included only the five asteroids determined to cause the largest perturbations. Better values of the planets' masses had been found since DE118/DE200, further refining the perturbations. [[Lunar Laser Ranging experiment|Lunar Laser Ranging]] accuracy was improved, giving better positions of the Moon. DE403 covered the time span Apr 1599 to Jun 2199.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |title=JPL PLANETARY AND LUNAR EPHEMERIDES : Export Information |author=Folkner |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115000000/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |archivedate=2012-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While both DE403 and DE404 were integrated over the same timespan, the interpolation of DE404 was somewhat reduced in accuracy and [[nutation]] of the Earth and [[libration]] of the Moon were not included.

'''DE405'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf|title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides, DE405/LE405|author=Standish|date=1998|work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum 312.F-98-048|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120220062549/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/de405iom/de405iom.pdf|archivedate=February 20, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 1998. It added several years' extra data from telescopic, radar, spacecraft, and VLBI observations (of the [[Galileo (spacecraft)|Galileo]] spacecraft at Jupiter, in particular). The method of modeling the asteroids' perturbations was improved, although the same number of asteroids were modeled. The ephemeris was more accurately oriented onto the ICRF. DE405 covered 1600 to 2200 to full precision. This ephemeris was utilized in the Astronomical Almanac from 2003 until 2014.

'''DE406''' was released with DE405 in 1998. A Long Ephemeris, this was the condensed version of DE405, covering 3000 BC to AD 3000 with the same limitations as DE404. This is the same integration as DE405, with the accuracy of the interpolating polynomials has been lessened to reduce file size for the longer time span covered by the file.

'''DE407'''&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web |url=http://202.127.29.4/cddisa/data_base/IERS/Annual_Reports/Annual_Report_2004.pdf |title=IERS Annual Report 2004}} which mentions DE407 only very briefly.&lt;/ref&gt; was apparently unreleased. Details in readily-available sources are sketchy.

'''DE408'''&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/a_old_versions/de408.cmt |title=de408.cmt}} at NASA's Navigation and Ancillary Information Facility website and {{cite journal |bibcode=2007Icar..187..365P |title=Long-period forcing of Mercury's libration in longitude |last=Peale |first=S.

'''DE409'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de409.iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary Ephemeris DE409 |author=Standish |date=2003 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 312.N-03-007}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2003 for the [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] spacecraft arrival at Mars and the [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] arrival at Saturn. Further spacecraft ranging and VLBI (to the [[Mars Global Surveyor]], [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft) and telescopic data were included in the fit. The orbits of the [[Pioneer 11|Pioneer]] and [[Voyager program|Voyager]] spacecraft were reprocessed to give data points for Saturn. These resulted in improvements over DE405, especially to the predicted positions of Mars and Saturn. DE409 covered the years 1901 to 2019.

'''DE410'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://128.149.23.134/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de410.iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary Ephemeris DE410 |author=Standish |date=2003 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 312.N-03-009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also released in 2003 covered 1901 - 2019, with improvements from DE409 in the masses for Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn and the Earth-Moon system based on recent research. Though the masses had not yet been adopted by the [[International Astronomical Union|IAU]]. The ephemerides were created to support the arrivals of the [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] and [[Cassini–Huygens|Cassini]] spacecraft.

'''DE411'''&lt;ref name="Standish"&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web |url=http://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/a_old_versions/de413_memo.pdf |title=The Ephemeris of Pluto: DE413 |author=Standish |date=2004 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343-04-008}} which compares DE413 output with DE411.&lt;/ref&gt;  was widely cited in the astronomical community, but not publicly released by JPL

'''DE412'''&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web |url=http://iopscience.iop.org/2041-8205/720/2/L201/fulltext/apjl_720_2_201.text.html |title=Measuring the Mass of Solar System Planets Using Pulsar Timing |work=The Astrophysical Journal Letters |date=2010 |author=Champion|display-authors=etal}} which references DE412.&lt;/ref&gt; was widely cited in the astronomical community, but not publicly released by JPL

'''DE413'''&lt;ref name="Standish" /&gt; was released in 2004 with updated ephemeris of [[Pluto]] in support of the [[occultation]] of a star by its satellite [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] on 11 Jul 2005. DE413 was fit to new [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] telescopic observations of Pluto in order to give improved positions of the planet and its moon.

'''DE414'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de414.iom.pdf |title=JPL Planetary Ephemeris DE414 |author=Standish |date=2006 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-06-002}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 2005 and released in 2006. The [[numerical integration]] software was updated to use [[Quadruple-precision floating-point format|quadruple-precision]] for the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|Newtonian]] part of the [[equations of motion]]. Ranging data to the [[Mars Global Surveyor]] and [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Mars Odyssey]] spacecraft were extended to 2005, and further CCD observations of the five outer planets were included in the fit. Some data was accidentally left out of the fit, namely [[Magellan (spacecraft)|Magellan]] Venus data for 1992-94 and Galileo Jupiter data for 1996-97. Some ranging data to the [[NEAR|NEAR Shoemaker]] spacecraft orbiting the asteroid [[433 Eros|Eros]] was used to derive the Earth/Moon mass ratio. DE414 covered the years 1599 to 2201.

'''DE418'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/spk/planets/a_old_versions/de418_announcement.pdf |title=Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE418 |author=Folkner |display-authors=etal |date=2007 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-07-005}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2007 for planning the [[New Horizons]] mission to Pluto. New observations of Pluto, which took advantage of the new [[Astrometry|astrometric]] accuracy of the [[Hipparcos]] star catalog, were included in the fit. Mars spacecraft ranging and VLBI observations were updated through 2007. Asteroid masses were estimated differently. Lunar laser ranging data for the Moon was added for the first time since DE403, significantly improving the lunar orbit and librations. Estimated position data from the Cassini spacecraft was included in the fit, improving the orbit of Saturn, but rigorous analysis of the data was deferred to a later date. DE418 covered the years 1899 to 2051, and JPL recommended not using it outside of that range due to minor inconsistencies which remained in the planets' masses due to time constraints.

'''DE421'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de421.iom.v1.pdf |title=The Planetary and Lunar Ephemeris DE421 |author=Folkner |display-authors=etal |date=2008 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-08-003}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2008. It included additional ranging and VLBI measurements of Mars spacecraft, new ranging and VLBI of the [[Venus Express]] spacecraft, the latest estimates of planetary masses, additional lunar laser ranging, and two more months of CCD measurements of Pluto.  When initially released in 2008, the DE421 ephemeris covered the years 1900 to 2050.  An additional data release in 2013 extended the coverage to the year 2200.

'''DE422'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |title=JPL Planetary and Lunar Ephemerides : Export Information |author=Folkner |date=2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120115211922/http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/README.html |archivedate=January 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was created in 2009 for the [[MESSENGER]] mission to Mercury. A Long Ephemeris, it was intended to replace DE406, covering 3000 BC to AD 3000.

'''DE423'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ioms/de423.iom.pdf |title=Planetary Ephemeris DE423 fit to Messenger encounters with Mercury |author=Folkner |date=2010 |work=JPL Interoffice Memorandum IOM 343.R-10-001}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released in 2010. Position estimates of the MESSENGER spacecraft and additional range and VLBI data from the Venus Express spacecraft were fit. DE423 covered the years 1799 to 2200.

'''DE424'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=ftp://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/eph/planets/ascii/de424/README.txt |title=

'''Küpfmüller's uncertainty principle''' by [[Karl Küpfmüller]] states that the relation of the rise time of a bandlimited signal to its bandwidth is a constant.

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f\Delta t \ge k&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; either &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Proof==
A bandlimited signal &lt;math&gt;u(t)&lt;/math&gt; with [[fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}(f)&lt;/math&gt; in frequency space is given by the multiplication of any signal &lt;math&gt;\underline{\hat{u}}(f)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\hat{u}(f) = {{\underline{\hat{u}}(f)}}{{\Big|}_{\Delta f}}&lt;/math&gt; with a [[rectangular function]] of width &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{g}(f) = \operatorname{rect} \left(\frac{f}{\Delta f} \right) =\chi_{[-\Delta f/2,\Delta f/2]}(f)
      := \begin{cases}1 &amp; |f|\le\Delta f/2 \\ 0 &amp; \text{else} \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

as (applying the [[convolution theorem]])

:&lt;math&gt;\hat{g}(f) \cdot \hat{u}(f) = (g * u)(t)  &lt;/math&gt;

Since the fourier transform of a rectangular function is a [[sinc function]] and vice versa, follows

:&lt;math&gt; g(t) = \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi}}  \int \limits_{-\frac{\Delta f}{2}}^{\frac{\Delta f}{2}} 1 \cdot e^{j 2 \pi f t} df = \frac1{\sqrt{2\pi}} \cdot \Delta f \cdot \operatorname{si} \left( \frac{2 \pi t \cdot \Delta f}{2} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

Now the first root of &lt;math&gt; g(t) &lt;/math&gt; is at &lt;math&gt; \pm \frac{1}{\Delta f} &lt;/math&gt;, which is the rise time &lt;math&gt; \Delta t &lt;/math&gt; of the [[Pulse (signal processing)|pulse]] &lt;math&gt; g(t) &lt;/math&gt;, now follows

:&lt;math&gt; \Delta t =  \frac{1}{\Delta f} &lt;/math&gt;

Equality is given as long as &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt; is finite.

Regarding that a real signal has both positive and negative frequencies of the same frequency band, &lt;math&gt;\Delta f&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;2 \cdot \Delta f&lt;/math&gt;,
which leads to &lt;math&gt;k = \frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;k = 1&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6977">'''Levels of edit''' (or '''levels of editing''') describes a cumulative or categorical scheme for revising text. Beginning as a tool that helped standardize communication between writers and editors at a government laboratory, published information about levels of edit was later made available to the general public. Subsequently, others developed a variety of levels of edit, which are now accessible through print and web-based resources.

== History ==
Van Buren and Buehler of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) developed five levels of edit defined by nine editorial categories.
# Coordination: Consider version and circulation, Consider the review cycles
# Policy: Consider the organizational structure
# Integrity: Are sources noted? 
# Screening: Consider spelling. Are visuals/art presented with clarity?
# Copy clarification: Are images legible? Are images trimmed?
# Format: What are the layout conventions?  What are the typographical conventions?
# Mechanical style: Check spelling and usage.
# Language: Make edits for clarity and concision.
# Substantive
In 1976, JPL first published Van Buren and Buehler's work as The Levels of Edit.&lt;ref name=buren1980&gt;Van Buren, R., and M .F. Buehler. 1980. ''The Levels of Edit'', Jet Propulsion Laboratory. Pasadena: California Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt; JPL published a second edition in 1980, and the [[US Government Printing Office|United States Government Printing Office]] (GPO) sold copies of the book to the general public. After the GPO’s supply of the second edition was depleted, the [[Society for Technical Communication]] (STC) made available a facsimile reprint of the second edition.

Drawing on Van Buren and Buehler’s work, in 1985 the writing and editing group at the [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] established four levels of edit for technical reports. A team at the laboratory revised the work following a 1994 survey that indicated the original four levels no longer met authors’ needs. The Los Alamos revision presented three “author-based” levels of edit (proofreading edit, grammar edit, and full edit) whose goals were to “simplify the editing process, focus editing on improving technical clarity, and ensure that value was added in editing.”&lt;ref name=prono1998&gt;Prono, J., DeLanoy, M., Deupree, R., Skiby, J., and B. Thompson. 1998. “Developing New Levels of Edit,” Los Alamos, NM: Los Alamos National Laboratory.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, Rude reduced the levels to just two types: 1) comprehensive editing and 2) copyediting.&lt;ref name=rude2006&gt;Rude, C. D. 2006. ''Technical Editing'' (4th ed.), New York: Pearson Longman.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several chapters in New Perspectives on Technical Editing, edited by Avon J. Murphy,&lt;ref name=murphy2010&gt;Murphy, A.J. (Ed.) 2010. ''New Perspectives on Technical Editing'', Amityville, New York: Baywood Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; include discussions of the different types of edits.

Other researchers built schemes based on editing rules, tasks, and analyses. For example, Tarutz defined a hierarchy of levels&lt;ref name=tarutz1992&gt;Tarutz, J. 1992. ''Technical Editing: The Practical Guide for Editors and Writers''. Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley.&lt;/ref&gt; that Corbin and Oestreich referred to in their presentation at the 2011 STC Summit&lt;ref name=corbin2011&gt;Corbin, M. and L. Oestreich. 2011. “Editing: Reviewing Levels and Choosing Types.” Presented at the 58th annual conference of the Society for Technical Communication, Technical Communication Summit, Sacramento, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; as “informal,” as follows.

# Turning pages (a superficial look of the text)
# Skimming (correcting obvious errors of spelling, grammar, and punctuation)
# Skimming and comparing (seeking internal consistency, including cross-references)
# Reading (improving writing style, such as wording and usage)
# Analyzing (identifying and fixing organizational flaws, missing information, redundancy, and technical inconsistency)
# Testing and using (fixing technical errors and resolving usability problems)


To bring a quality assurance perspective to technical editing, Corbin and others mapped types of edit to types of testing, for example, “system testing to comprehensive editing” and “function testing to copyediting” (p.&amp;nbsp;290).&lt;ref name=corbin2002&gt;Corbin, M., Moell, P., and M. Boyd. 2002. “Technical Editing As Quality Assurance: Adding Value to Content.” ''Technical Communication'', 49 (3): 286-300.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other variations ==
As web-based on-demand proofreading and editing services have become increasingly available, the number of edit levels and editing schemes has increased in variety. For example, three cumulative levels is a common scheme, typically 1) light, 2) medium, and 3) heavy editing, although another three-level scheme appears frequently across websites: 1) proofreading and 2) light and 3) heavy editing. Four levels usually differs from a three-level scheme only by the inclusion of a mid-range level, such as 1) basic proofreading and 2) light, 3) medium, and 4) heavy editing.&lt;ref name=dr2010&gt;dr. edit®. 2010-2011. Online: [http://www.dr-edit.com www.dr-edit.com]. Irvine, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; No matter the scheme, a level of edit defined as heavy often results in a complete rewrite. And one web-based service offers six levels of edit according to a partially cumulative scheme:
# Basic proofreading
# Complete editing without comments
# Complete editing with comments
# Manuscript critique
# Formatting and layout
# Verification of citation sources.&lt;ref name=lombardino2008&gt;David Lombardino &amp; Associates. 2008-2011. Online: [http://www.the-draft-editor.com www.the-draft-editor.com].&lt;/ref&gt;
Based on the function of the edit and the working unit to which it applies, eight levels of edit are also presented, as follows.

The '''Living Human Project''' ('''LHP''') is a project that begun in 2002 to develop a distributed repository of anatomo-functional data and simulation algorithms for the human [[musculoskeletal]] apparatus used to create the [[physiome]] of the human musculoskeletal system. In 2006 the BEL was merged with Biomed Town, a Internet community for those who have a professional interest in biomedical research.

==Living Human Digital Library==
The LHDL project was ended in January 2009, and soon after the LHDL consortium released a biomedical data management and sharing service called ''Physiome Space''. Physiome Space lets individual researchers as well as for large consortia to share with their peers large collections of biomedical data, including medical imaging and computer simulations.

{{Linguistics}}

In some theories of syntax and grammar, in particular in the Chomskyan schools of [[government and binding theory]] and the [[minimalist program]], the '''Logical Form''' (abbreviated '''LF''' and conventionally spelled with capital initial letters) of a linguistic expression is a [[mental representation]] of it, derived solely from [[surface structure]]. In the words of [[Noam Chomsky]], LF captures "those aspects of semantic representation that are strictly determined by grammar, abstracted from other cognitive systems".{{sfn|Collinge|1990}} It functions as the interface between grammar and conceptual-intentional properties of language, analogous to how the '''[[phonetic form]]''' (abbreviated '''PF''') is the interface between grammar and the audio-perceptual properties of utterances.

Logical Form is the level of representation that affects the semantic interpretation of a sentence. LF is sometimes referred to as a [[Covert (linguistics)|covert]] level of representation, because the output of this level is not actually pronounced by the speaker.{{sfn|Ouhalla|1999}}

Many theories of syntax do not acknowledge the concept of Logical Form (e.g. [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Dependency grammar|Dependency Grammars]], [[Tree-Adjoining Grammar]], etc.), at least not in the way it is understood in Government and Binding Theory and the Minimalist Program. The postulation of such a level of representation remains a subject of debate.

== Syntax interfacing with semantics ==
The notion of Logical Form was originally invented for the purpose of determining [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]] scope. As the theory around the Minimalist program developed, all output conditions, such as theta-criterion, the case filter, Subjacency and [[binding theory]], are examined at the level of LF. The study of LF is more broad than the study of [[syntax]].{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003|pages=607, 633}}

=== The notion of scope ===

The definition of scope was introduced early in the development of Logical Form scholarship. The scope of an operator is the domain within which it has the ability to affect the interpretation of other expressions. In other words, an operator has scope of operation, or affecting the interpretation of other phrases, only within its own domain. Three uncontroversial examples of scope affecting some aspect of the interpretation are: quantifier-quantifier, quantifier-[[pronoun]], quantifier-[[negative polarity item]].

In instances where a negation has an indefinite article in its scope, the reader's interpretation is affected. The reader is not able to infer the existence of a relevant entity. If negation (or a negation phrase) is within the subject quantifier scope, [[negation]] is not affected by the quantifier.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}
If the Quantified Expresstion1 (QE1) is in the domain of QE2, but not vice versa, QE1 must take a narrow scope; if both are in the domain of the other, the structure is potentially ambiguous. If neither QE is in the domain of the other, they must be interpreted independently.{{sfn|Ioup|1975}} These assumptions explain the cases where the direct object of the main clause is not within the domain of the embedded subject. For example, ''that every boy left upset a teacher'', it cannot be interpreted as ''for every boy, there is a possibly different teacher who was upset by the fact that the boy left''. The only available interpretation is that ''one single teacher was upset''.{{sfn|Szabolcsi|2003}}

[[File:LF-everyone loves someone 2.png|thumb|Everyone loves the same someone]][[File:LF-everyone loves someone.png|thumb|Everyone has someone that they love, not necessarily the same person]]

=== Ambiguity motivation ===

In syntax, LF exists to give a structural account of certain kinds of [[semantics|semantic]] ambiguities.

==== Example ====

: ''Everyone loves someone.''

This sentence is semantically ambiguous. Specifically, it contains a [[Free variables and bound variables|scope]] ambiguity. This ambiguity cannot be resolved at surface structure, since ''someone'', being within the [[verb phrase]], must be lower in the structure than ''everyone''. This case exemplifies the general fact that natural language is ''insufficiently specified'' for strict logical meaning. Robert May argued for the postulation of LF partly in order to account for such ambiguities (among other motivations). At LF, the sentence above would have two possible structural representations, one for each possible scope-reading, in order to account for the ambiguity by structural differentiation. In this way it is similar in purpose to, but not the same as, [[logical form]] in [[logic]].{{sfn|Hanna|2006|pages=50–51}}

== Quantification ==

=== Key historical developments===
There has been discussion about quantification since the 1970s. In 1974, Montague argued that a grammar for a small fragment of English contains the logicosyntactic and semantic devices to handle practically any scope phenomenon.{{sfn|Montague|1974}} The tool that he mainly relied on is categorical syntax with functional application; in terms of recent formulations, it can be considered Minimalist syntax with [[Merge (linguistics)|Merge]] only. However, this approach does not make predictions for some examples with inverse scope (wide scope in [[object (grammar)|object]] position).

For example, '''''everyone loves someone'''''.

When there is no scope interaction in the relevant portion of the sentence, making either choice shows no difference in semantics.

A short time later, May suggested a different idea.{{sfn|May|1977}} In contrast to Montague, May did not propose any syntax that generates the surface string. He proposed a rule called Quantifier Raising (QR), which explains that movement operations of [[wh-movement]] continue to operate on the level of LF, and each phrase continues to possess the quantifier in its domain. May suggested that QR applies to all quantifier phrases with no exception.

The study of Quantification carried on in the 1980s. In contrast to May and Montague, it was suggested that independently motivated phrase structure, such as the relative clause, imposes a limitation on scope options.{{sfn|Reinhart|1983}}

This clause boundedness somewhat restricts the QR. May also noticed a subject-object asymmetry with respect to the interaction of wh-words and quantifier phrases.{{sfn|May|1985}} A modified version of his past work that QR determines quantifier scope but does not disambiguate it was brought up. To regulate the interaction, The Scope Principle that if two operators govern each other, they can be interpreted in either scopal order was also brought up. However, this solution has eventually been abandoned.

As [[Minimalism]] showed up in 1990s, more studies have been related to Minimalist syntax.{{sfn|Chomsky|1993}} A strategy to remedy the situation is to eliminate QR and the expected scope would be by-products of entirely independent grammatical processes.{{sfn|Hornstein|1995}} The other strategy is to modify QR and show it can be fitted into a Minimalist structure.{{sfn|Beghelli|1993}}{{sfn|Beghelli|Stowell|1997}}

===Quantificational noun phrases===
Danny Fox discusses syntactic positions of QNPs as a way of introducing and illustrating the basic semantic and syntactic relations found in LF.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} By looking at the meaning of QNPs in relation to the property they are given, or their predicate, we can derive the meaning of the whole sentence.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
a. ''A girl is tall.''

b. ''Many girls are tall.''

c. ''Every girl is tall.''

d. ''No girl is tall.''{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}
To understand the Logical Form of these examples, it is important to identify what the basic [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] is and which segments make up the QNPs. In these examples, the predicate is tall and the QNPs are a girl, many girls, every girl and no girl. The logical meaning of these sentences indicates that the [[Property (philosophy)|property]] of being tall is attributed to some form of the QNP referring to girl. Along with the QNP and the predicate, there is also an inference of truth value. Either the truth value is True for a person who is tall, otherwise the truth value is False.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

Each of the examples above will have different conditions that make the statement true according to the quantifier that precedes girl.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 
'''Truth Value conditions:'''

Example a. ''A girl'' has a truth value of '''true if and only if''' ([[iff]]) at least one girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example b. ''Many girls'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' there are many girls who are tall.  &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier is satisfied with more than 1 instance of a girl being tall.

Example c. ''Every girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' every girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that every instance of a person being female, she must be tall.

Example d. ''No girl'' has a truth value of '''true iff''' no girl is tall. &lt;br /&gt;This quantifier requires for all girls, that for all instances of a person being female, she must not be tall.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}
|}

In a syntactic tree, the structure is represented as such: "the [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]] of a QNP is always the sister of the QNP."{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}}

== WH-movement ==
In linguistics, wh-phrases are operators binding variables at LF, like other quantifier noun phrases. Scope interpretations can be constrained by syntactic constraints as shown in LF when regarding the scope of wh-phrases and quantifiers. When [[wh-movement]] is from the subject position it is unambiguous, but when wh-movement is from the object position it is ambiguous.{{sfn|May|1985}}

=== Examples ===
{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
1) What did everyone buy for Max?

:''[S’ what&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [S everyone&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [S e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]''

:(Two possible interpretations: what did everyone

:'''collectively buy''', versus '''individually buy''')

2) Who bought everything for Max?

:''[S’ who&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [S everything&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [S e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]''

:(Only one possible interpretation.)

|}

This example demonstrates the effect of the Path Containment Condition (PCC). An A'-path is a line of dominating nodes that go from the trace to a c-commanding A'-binder. If two of the A'paths intersect then one must be contained in the other. If the paths are overlapping without having one being contained in the other, then it is ill-formed. (2)'s paths are overlapping, violating PCC, therefore in order to obtain a grammatical LF structure, everything needs to join the VP. The LF structure then becomes:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
|
: LF REPRESENTATION:
:[s’ who&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [s e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [vp everything&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [vp bought e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for max]
  |}

== Cross-linguistic examples==

=== Hungarian ===

&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:The tree to show the Hungarian data in support of Beghelli and Stowell.png|thumb|right|The tree structure has been abbreviated. It is to show the linear relation between three QP: ''Öt orvos'', ''minden betegnek'', and ''kevés új tablettát'']] --&gt;

: five doctor few patient-Dat every new pill-Acc wrote up
: ''"There are five doctors x such that for some patient y,x prescribed a new pill to y. "''
|}

In the sentence, ''"Five doctors prescribed few new pills to every patient."'', the scope in Hungarian is largely disambiguated by the linear order of quantifiers on the surface. Two facts that should be kept in mind are (1) the linear order is not obtained by putting quantifiers together in the desired order, which contradicts the predictions made by Montague or May's theory; (2) the linear order is not determined by case or grammatical functions, which supports the prediction of Hornstein's theory. {{sfn|Szabolcsi|2002}}

The significance of A-chains has been emphasized in the Chinese language. Scope in Chinese is disambiguated by case positions in some examples. {{sfn|Aoun|Li|1993}} In this example, the active sentence only has subject wide scope, but the passive sentence is ambiguous. The active sentence only has one interpretation: 
if there are two women who read every book, which is in the subject wide scope. According to Aoun and Li, Chinese does not have VP-internal subjects, thus, ''liangge nuren'' cannot be reconstructed in LF. So the sentence has no ambiguous interpretation. However, the passive sentence has two interpretations, 1. everyone finds the same two clues; 2. everyone finds two clues, while two clues can be different ones. That is because ''liangge xiansuo'' is in VP-internal complement position, then in LF, it can be reconstructed. So the passive sentence has two different interpretations.

: ''A boy climbed every tree.''
: i. A single boy climbed all the trees.
: ii.For every tree there is a boy, who may be different for each tree, that climbed tree X.
|}

This phrase is ambiguous in that it can be interpreted as the noun 'boy' referring to a particular individual or to a different individual for each instance of 'tree' under the quantifier 'every'.{{sfn|Hendrick|2003}} The interpretation that a single boy climbed all the trees takes a wide scope, while the other interpretation that for every tree there is a boy, who maybe be different for each tree takes a narrow scope.

The '''Maxims of Islamic Law''' were established after representatives of all schools of thought regarding Muslim Jurisprudence came together to reach a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Abd-Allah, Umar Faruq. "Islam and the cultural imperative." CrossCurrents (2006): 357-375. [http://www.nawawi.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Article3.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}
Maxims refer to a body of abstract rules that were produced after a detailed study of the fiqh. They’re theoretical guidelines corresponding to different areas of [[fiqh]], which may be dealing with anything from evidence to [[matrimonial law]].&lt;ref&gt;Kamali, Mohammad Hashim. Principles of Islamic jurisprudence. The Islamic Text Society, 1991., https://d1.islamhouse.com/data/en/ih_books/single2/en_Principles_of_Islamic_Jurisprudence.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fiqh]] is Islamic jurisprudence,through the human interpretation of [[Islamic law]].

==The five Normative Maxims of Islamic law are==
* Al-umuru bi-maqasidiha: Acts are judged by the intention behind them
* Ad-dararu yuzal: Harm must be eliminated 
* Al-yaqinu la yazulu bish-shakk: Certainty is not overruled by doubt
* Al-'addatu muhakkamatun: Custom is the basis of judgement
* Al-mashaqqatu tujlab at-taysir: Hardship begets facility&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Godlas|first1=Alan|title=The five Universal Maxims of Islamic Law|url=http://islam.uga.edu/law_maxims.html|website=Islamic Studies- University of Georgia|accessdate=16 November 2016|ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8849">A '''mixotroph''' is an organism that can use a mix of different [[Primary nutritional groups|sources of energy and carbon]], instead of having a single trophic mode on the continuum from complete [[autotrophy]] at one end to [[heterotrophy]] at the other.

Possible combinations are   [[phototroph|photo-]] and [[chemotroph]]y, [[lithotroph|litho-]] and [[organotroph]]y, [[autotroph|auto-]] and [[heterotroph]]y or other combinations of these. Mixotrophs can be either [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] or [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]].&lt;ref name='Eiler'&gt;{{cite journal |author= Eiler A |title= Evidence for the Ubiquity of Mixotrophic Bacteria in the Upper Ocean: Implications and Consequences |journal=Appl Environ Microbiol |volume=72 |issue=12 |pages= 7431–7|date=December 2006|pmid=17028233 |doi=10.1128/AEM.01559-06|pmc=1694265}}&lt;/ref&gt; They can take advantage of different environmental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Katechakis A, Stibor H |title= The mixotroph ''Ochromonas tuberculata'' may invade and suppress specialist phago- and phototroph plankton communities depending on nutrient conditions |journal= Oecologia|volume= 148 |issue= 4|pages=692–701 |date=July 2006|pmid=16568278 |doi= 10.1007/s00442-006-0413-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a trophic mode is obligate, then it is always necessary for sustaining growth and maintenance; if facultative, it can be used as a supplemental source.&lt;ref name='Eiler'/&gt; Some organisms have incomplete [[Calvin cycle]]s, so they are incapable of fixing carbon dioxide and must use organic carbon sources.

==Types of mixotrophy==

Organisms may employ mixotrophy '''obligately''' or '''facultatively'''.
* Obligate mixotrophy: in order to support growth and maintenance, an organism must utilize both heterotrophic and autotrophic means.
* Obligate autotrophy with facultative heterotrophy: Autotrophy alone is sufficient for growth and maintenance, but heterotrophy may be used as a supplementary strategy when autotrophic energy is not enough, for example, when light intensity is low.
* Facultative autotrophy with obligate heterotrophy: Heterotrophy is sufficient for growth and maintenance, but autotrophy may be used to supplement, for example, when prey availability is very low.
* Facultative mixotrophy: Maintenance and growth may be obtained by heterotrophic or autotrophic means alone, and mixotrophy is used only when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schoonhoven|first1=Erwin|title=Ecophysiology of Mixotrophs|journal=Thesis|date=January 19, 2000|url=http://www.bio.vu.nl/thb/education/Scho2000.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to characterize the sub-domains within mixotrophy, several very similar categorization schemes have been suggested.

Consider the example of a marine protist with heterotrophic and photosynthetic capabilities:
In the breakdown put forward by Jones,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=H.J.L. |date=1997|title=A classification of mixotrophic protists based on their behaviour |journal= Freshwater Biology  |volume=37 |pages=35–43 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2427.1997.00138.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are four mixotrophic groups based on relative roles of phagotrophy and phototrophy.
* A: Heterotrophy (phagotrophy) is the norm, and phototrophy is only used when prey concentrations are limiting.
* B: Phototrophy is the dominant strategy, and phagotrophy is employed as a supplement when light is limiting.
* C: Phototrophy results in substances for both growth and ingestion, phagotrophy is employed when light is limiting.
* D: Phototrophy is most common nutrition type, phagotrophy only used during prolonged dark periods, when light is extremely limiting.

An alternative scheme by Stoeker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stoecker |first=D.K. |date=1998|title=Conceptual models of mixotrophy in planktonic protists and some ecological and evolutionary implications |journal=European Journal of Protistology |volume=34 |pages=281–290 |doi=10.1016/s0932-4739(98)80055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; also takes into account the role of nutrients and growth factors, and includes mixotrophs that have a photosynthetic symbiont or who retain chloroplasts from their prey. This scheme characterizes mixotrophs by their efficiency.
* Type 1: "Ideal mixotrophs" who utilize prey and sunlight equally well
* Type 2: Supplement phototrophic activity with food consumption
* Type 3: Primarily heterotrophic, use phototrophic activity during times of very low prey abundance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tarangkoon|first1=Woraporn|title=Mixtrophic Protists among Marine Ciliates and Dinoflagellates: Distribution, Physiology and Ecology|journal=Thesis|date=29 April 2010|url=http://www.bi.ku.dk/bibliotek/phd/Woraporn%20Tarangkoon.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

* ''[[Paracoccus|Paracoccus pantotrophus]]'' is a bacterium that can live chemoorganoheterotrophically, whereby a large variety of organic compounds can be metabolized. Also a facultative [[lithotroph|chemolithoautotrophic]] metabolism is possible, as seen in colorless sulfur bacteria (some ''Thiobacillus''), whereby sulfur compounds such as [[hydrogen sulfide]], elemental [[sulfur]], or [[thiosulfate]] are oxidized to sulfate. The sulfur compounds serve as [[electron donors]] and are consumed to produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].  The carbon source for these organisms can be carbon dioxide (autotrophy) or organic carbon (heterotrophy).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Libes| first= Susan M.| title= Introduction to marine biogeochemistry| year= 2009| edition=2| publisher= Academic Press| page= 192| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KVZJUw4nORgC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotrophs+inorganic&amp;lr=&amp;cd=53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-7637-5345-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Dworkin| first= Martin | title= The Prokaryotes: Ecophysiology and biochemistry| year= 2006| edition= 3rd| volume= 2| publisher= Springer| page= 988| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=uleTr2jKzJMC&amp;pg=PA988&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotroph+chemoorganoheterotroph&amp;cd=4#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph%20chemoorganoheterotroph&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-0-387-25492-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lengeler | first1= Joseph W.| last2= Drews| first2= Gerhart| last3= Schlegel| first3= Hans Günter | title= Biology of the Prokaryotes| year= 1999| publisher= Georg Thieme Verlag| page= 238| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=MiwpFtTdmjQC&amp;pg=PA238&amp;dq=chemolithoheterotroph+sulfur+bacteria&amp;cd=6#v=onepage&amp;q=chemolithoheterotroph%20sulfur%20bacteria&amp;f=false| isbn= 978-3-13-108411-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Organoheterotrophy can occur under [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] or under [[Aerobic organism|anaerobic]] conditions; lithoautotrophy takes place aerobically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bartosik D, Sochacka M, Baj J |title= Identification and Characterization of Transposable Elements of ''Paracoccus pantotrophus'' |journal= J Bacteriol |volume=185 |issue=13 |pages= 3753–63|date=July 2003|pmid=12813068 |doi= 10.1128/JB.185.13.3753-3763.2003|pmc=161580}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Friedrich| first=Cornelius G.|title=Microbial Sulfur Metabolism|year=2007|chapter=Redox Control of Chemotrophic Sulfur Oxidation of ''Paracoccus pantotrophus''|pages=139–150|publisher=Springer|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x412771504738714/|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.springerlink.com/content/x412771504738714/fulltext.pdf?page=1 PDF]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst plants, mixotrophy classically applies to [[Carnivorous plant|carnivorous]], [[Parasitic plant#Classification|hemi-parasitic]] and [[Myco-heterotrophy|myco-heterotrophic]] species. However, this characterisation as mixotrophic could be extended to a higher number of clades as research demonstrates that organic forms of nitrogen and phosphorus — such as DNA, proteins, amino-acids or carbohydrates — are also part of the nutrient supplies of a number of plant species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1071/FP13061 | issn = 1445-4408 | volume = 40 | issue = 5 | pages = 425 | last = Schmidt | first = Susanne |author2=John A.

{{About|biological molecular motors|man-made molecular motors|Synthetic molecular motor}}
'''Molecular motors''' are biological [[molecular machine]]s that are the essential agents of movement in living organisms. In general terms, a [[Engine|motor]] is a device that consumes energy in one form and converts it into motion or [[mechanical work]]; for example, many [[protein]]-based molecular motors harness the chemical [[Gibbs free energy|free energy]] released by the [[hydrolysis]] of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] in order to perform mechanical work.&lt;ref name="review"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bustamante C, Chemla YR, Forde NR, Izhaky D |title=Mechanical processes in biochemistry |journal=Annu. Rev. Biochem. |volume=73 |issue= |pages=705–48 |year=2004 |pmid=15189157 |doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.72.121801.161542}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of energetic efficiency, this type of motor can be superior to currently available man-made motors. One important difference between molecular motors and macroscopic motors is that molecular motors operate in the [[Thermal bath (thermodynamics)|thermal bath]], an environment in which the [[Thermal fluctuations|fluctuations]] due to [[Fluctuation dissipation theorem|thermal noise]] are significant.

** [[Myosin]]s are responsible for muscle contraction, intracellular cargo transport, and producing cellular tension. 
** [[Kinesin]] moves cargo inside cells away from the nucleus along [[microtubule]]s.
** [[Dynein]] produces the [[axoneme|axonemal]] beating of [[cilia]] and [[flagella]] and also transports cargo along microtubules towards the cell nucleus.
* Polymerisation motors
** [[Actin]] polymerization generates forces and can be used for propulsion. [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is used.

The catalysis of the chemical reaction and the movement of protons are coupled to each other via the mechanical rotation of parts of the complex. This is involved in ATP synthesis in the [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] as well as in [[V-ATPase|pumping of protons across the vacuolar membrane]].&lt;ref name="ATPase"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tsunoda SP, Aggeler R, Yoshida M, Capaldi RA |title=Rotation of the c subunit oligomer in fully functional F1Fo ATP synthase |journal=Proc.

** The bacterial [[flagellum]] responsible for the swimming and tumbling of ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' and other bacteria acts as a rigid propeller that is powered by a rotary motor.

A-DNA is 23% shorter than B-DNA, and the DNA shrink/expand cycle is coupled to a protein-DNA grip/release cycle to generate the forward motion that propels DNA into the capsid.

**Urease
**Aldolase
**Hexokinase
**Phosphoglucose isomerase
**Phosphofructokinase
*[[Synthetic molecular motors]] have been created by chemists that yield rotation, possibly generating torque.

== Theoretical considerations ==
Because the motor events are [[stochastic]], molecular motors are often modeled with the [[Fokker–Planck equation]] or with [[Monte Carlo method]]s. These theoretical models are especially useful when treating the molecular motor as a [[Brownian motor]].

== Experimental observation ==
In experimental [[biophysics]], the activity of molecular motors is observed with many different experimental approaches, among them:

* Fluorescent methods: fluorescence resonance energy transfer ([[Fluorescence resonance energy transfer|FRET]]), fluorescence correlation spectroscopy ([[Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy|FCS]]), total internal reflection fluorescence ([[Total internal reflection fluorescence microscope|TIRF]]).
* [[Magnetic tweezers]] can also be useful for analysis of motors that operate on long pieces of DNA.
* [[Neutron spin echo]] spectroscopy can be used to observe motion on nanosecond timescales.
* [[Optical tweezers]] (not to be confused with [[molecular tweezers]] in context) are well-suited for studying molecular motors because of their low spring constants.
* Scattering techniques: single particle tracking based on [[dark field microscopy]] or [[interferometric scattering microscopy]] (iSCAT)
* Single-molecule [[electrophysiology]] can be used to measure the dynamics of individual ion channels.

Many more techniques are also used. As new technologies and methods are developed, it is expected that knowledge of naturally occurring molecular motors will be helpful in constructing synthetic nanoscale motors.

== Non-biological ==
{{Main|Synthetic molecular motor}}
Recently, [[chemists]] and those involved in [[nanotechnology]] have begun to explore the possibility of creating molecular motors ''de novo.'' These [[synthetic molecular motors]] currently suffer many limitations that confine their use to the research laboratory. However, many of these limitations may be overcome as our understanding of chemistry and physics at the nanoscale increases. One step toward understanding nanoscale dynamics was made with the study of catalyst diffusion in the Grubb's catalyst system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dey|first=Krishna Kanti|last2=Pong|first2=Frances Ying|last3=Breffke|first3=Jens|last4=Pavlick|first4=Ryan|last5=Hatzakis|first5=Emmanuel|last6=Pacheco|first6=Carlos|last7=Sen|first7=Ayusman|date=2016|editor4-last=|title=Dynamic Coupling at the Angstrçm Scale|url=|journal=Angew. Chem.|volume=128|pages=1125–1129|doi=10.1002/ange.201509237}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other systems like the [[nanocar]]s, while not technically motors, are also illustrative of recent efforts towards synthetic nanoscale motors. 

Other non-reacting molecules can also behave as motors. This has been demonstrated by using dye molecules that move directionally in gradients of polymer solution through favorable hydrophobic interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guha|first=Rajarshi|last2=Mohajerani|first2=Farzad|last3=Collins|first3=Matthew|last4=Ghosh|first4=Subhadip|last5=Sen|first5=Ayusman|last6=Velegol|first6=Darrell|date=2017-10-24|title=Chemotaxis of Molecular Dyes in Polymer Gradients in Solution|url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jacs.7b08783|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=139|issue=44|pages=15588–15591|doi=10.1021/jacs.7b08783|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4618">The  '''OPC Foundation''' (OPC formally known as Object Linking and Embedding for Process Control) is an [[consortium|industry consortium]] that creates and maintains standards for open connectivity of [[industrial automation]] devices and systems, such as [[industrial control system]]s and [[process control]] generally. The OPC [[standardization|standard]]s specify the communication of industrial process data, [[alarm]]s and events, historical data and [[Batch processing|batch process]] data between [[sensor]]s, [[Measuring instrument|instrument]]s, [[Controller (computing)|controllers]],  software systems, and [[notification device]]s.

The OPC Foundation started in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the purpose of creating a basic [[OLE for process control|OLE for Process Control]] specification.  [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] is a technology developed by [[Microsoft Corporation]] for the [[Microsoft Windows|MS Windows]] operating system.  The task force released the OPC standard in August 1996.  The OPC Foundation was chartered to continue development of interoperability specifications and includes manufacturers and users of devices instruments, controllers, software and enterprise systems. 

The OPC Foundation cooperates with other organizations, such as [[MTConnect]], who share similar missions.

== OPC standards and specification groups ==
; [[OPC Data Access]] : This group of standards provides specifications for communicating real-time data from data acquisition devices such as [[Programmable logic controller|PLCs]] to display and interface devices like [[Human-Machine Interface]]s (HMI).  The specifications focus on the continuous communication of data

; OPC Alarms and Events : Standards for communicating alarm and event data on demand, as opposed to the continuous communications in the OPC Data Access group  

; OPC Batch : Standards to address the needs of [[Batch processing|batch processes]]

; OPC Data eXchange : This group of standards addresses [[inter-server|server to server]] communications across industrial networks.  The standards also address remote configuration, diagnostics, monitoring and management communications

; [[OPC Historical Data Access]] : Standards for communicating stored data

; OPC Security : Standards for controlling client access to OPC compliant devices and systems

; OPC XML-DA : Builds on the OPC Data Access specifications to communicate data in XML.  Incorporates [[SOAP]] and [[Web services]]

; OPC Complex Data : Standards for specifying the communication of complex data types such as binary data and XML documents

; OPC Commands : Standards for communicating control commands to devices and systems

; [[OPC Unified Architecture]] : An entirely new set of standards that incorporates all of the functionality of the above standards (and more), but does so using cross platform web services and other modern technology.

; OPC Certification :  The OPC Foundation has a well established Certification Process.  The OPC Foundation calls this the OPC Enhanced Certification Program.
The OPC Foundation enhanced the range for certification of OPC product to meet the increasing demand for reliable functionality and insured interoperability. The self-certification using the ComplianceTestTool (CTT) and the participation at an Interoperability Workshop (IOP) are now enhanced with a Certification in an independent test facility. According to the test specification here not only the OPC Data Access (DA2/3) interface is tested but also the overall behavior of the product in a real world environment is verified.

'''''Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, and the Economic World''''' ({{ISBN|978-0201483406}}) is a 1994 book by [[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]. (The book was also published as ''Out of control: the rise of neo-biological civilization''.)  Major themes in ''Out of Control'' are [[cybernetics]], [[emergence]], [[self-organization]], [[complex systems]], [[negentropy]] and [[chaos theory]] and it can be seen as a work of [[techno-utopianism]].

==Summary==
The central theme of the book is that several fields of contemporary science and philosophy point in the same direction: intelligence is not organized in a centralized structure but much more like a bee-hive of small simple components. Kelly applies this view to bureaucratic organizations, intelligent computers as well as to the human brain.

==Reception==
''Out of Control'' has been translated into five languages, including Spanish, German, Italian, Japanese and Chinese. Additionally, the United Kingdom editions have been adapted into British English.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | people = Kevin Kelly( author) | title = "Kevin Kelly -- Out of Control."  | medium = Webpage  | publisher =   | location =   |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The book was not widely reviewed when first released in 1994, but got visibly reviewed and extensively cited during the next several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| last = Turner| first = Fred
| title = From counterculture to cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the rise of digital utopianism
| location = Chicago| date = 2006| page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews often discussed Kelly’s hive-mind analogy as a [[metaphor]] for the [[New Economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Chicago Press| last = Turner| first = Fred | title = From counterculture to cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the rise of digital utopianism
| location = Chicago| date = 2006| page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewers have called this book  a "mind-expanding exploration" (''Publishers Weekly'') and "the best of an important new genre" (''Forbes ASAP'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite | people = Amazon webpage| title = "Out of Control: The New Biology of Machines, Social Systems, &amp; the Economic World [Paperback]."| medium = Webpage  | publisher = Amazon.com, Inc.| location =   |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Positivistic animism''' [[hypothesis]] states that some [[animism|animistic]] [[memes]] belonging to determined [[culture]] and [[natural environment]] can be confirmed by [[positivism]]. These memes are therefore called positivistic animistic memes and can easily evolve towards [[Evolutionary Stable Strategy]] within the structure of simple and new [[memeplexes]], if dissociated from the original [[memeplex]].

The distinction between positivistic animistic memes and non positivistic [[animistic]] memes can only be done through scientific experimentation.

The main hypothesis for this theory is that there is the possibility that local animistic cultures carry memes that have positivistic properties.

Following this hypothesis, the following premises for the postulated theory are:

In a determined culture, local animism has memes that replicate knowledge gathered through trial and error over millennia – i.e. positivistic memes – these memes are by definition scientifically acquired and provable for that determined environment.

Modern science can study animistic practices and replicable components (memes) of a determined culture – it is possible to extricate animistic memes, and distinguish which ones are possible to prove scientifically, thus are positivistic memes for that specific local environment and which memes are purely derived from mysticism or have been carried in from different environments.

As conclusion, by extricate animistic memes from local memeplexes and disseminate the positivistic animistic memes associated to different and simple memeplexes, it is possible to act as an evolutionary force over the memes and memeplex.

If the theory is right, the dissemination of Positivistic Animism Memes will be done at minimum cost and effort and will facilitate the assimilation of memeplexes that are exterior to the culture as there is cultural ownership and identity over some memes that are part of the new memeplex. This theory provides a way of replacing obsolete memeplexes that hinder de development of society in the new globalised world. However, and because it requires the thorough and systematic study of culture and its memeplexes, will always store the information that these obsolete memeplexes contain.

Possible applications of positivistic animism:

If proven true, this theory can have applications in a wide range of natural and social sciences, and can be an interface between a scientific elite and illiterate populations. This theory can also prevent the loss of ancient positivistic knowledge and preserve live cultures in face of globalization.

For example, the application of this theory can foster a strong cultural sense that is likely to be both environmental sensitive and sustainably reproduced.

As most indigenous cultures nowadays are under enormous pressure of [[globalization]], the Positivistic Animist Theory can give a way to preserve positivistic cultural elements alive in cultures. The study and recording of all components of culture, positivistic or not, is nevertheless of the utmost importance, as the positivistic properties are specific for a time and a place.

This theory is still in its phase of inception and has not being proved. The first step to test this theory is the identification of local animistic memes in a determined culture, and test if these memes are positivistic or not. The memes found positivistic can be then disseminated through communication channels and its acceptance in local culture should be tracked.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4704">The '''reading span task''' ('''RST''') is a common [[memory span]] task widely cited in, and adapted for, investigations of [[working memory]], [[cognitive processing]], and [[reading comprehension]] that was first published by [[Meredyth Daneman]] and [[Patricia Carpenter]] in 1980.&lt;ref name=daneman&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Carpenter, P. A. (1980). Individual differences in working memory and reading. [[Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior]], 19(4), 450-466.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Task==

===Original===

The original RST required participants to read series of unconnected sentences aloud and to remember the final word of each sentence of a series (grouped according to the total number of sentences). With each sentence presented on a card, participants were cued to recall the memorized end-of-sentence words in their original order by a blank card at the end of a series. The number of sentences of a series was incrementally increased until a participant's reading span, or the maximum number of final words correctly recalled, was found.

The reading span task was the first instance of the family of "complex span" tasks (as opposed to "simple span" tasks). It is a complex verbal test because it draws upon both storage and processing (i.e., reading) elements of working memory, while simple verbal tests (e.g., word span) require the storage element alone.&lt;ref&gt;Lobley, K.J., Baddeley, A.D., &amp; Gathercole, S.E. (2005). Phonological similarity effects in verbal complex span. ''The Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology'', ''58A'', 1462–1478.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Variants===

Besides the "listening span" variant also developed by Daneman and Carpenter,&lt;ref name=daneman /&gt; several variants have been developed in recent years based upon the RST.&lt;ref&gt;Desmette, D., Hupet, M., Schelstraete, M.A., &amp; Van der Linden, M.

===Problems===

In an attempt to formulate a standardized version of the RST, numerous problems with the original and variants of it have been critically examined.

==Findings==

Daneman and Carpenter found that reading span was much more strongly related to reading comprehension than word span. Later research corroborated the finding that reading span is more closely related to language comprehension than word span.&lt;ref&gt;Daneman, M., &amp; Merikle, P. M. (1996). Working memory and language comprehension: a meta-analysis. Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review, 3, 422-433.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiological basis===

In a twin study of middle-aged men, a heritability rating of .51 was found for reading span, where genetic influences came from a common latent phenotype, viewed as most likely reflecting an executive function component.&lt;ref&gt;Kremen, W., Jacobsen, K., Xian, H., Eisen, S., Eaves, L., Tsuang, M., et al. (2007). Genetics of verbal working memory processes: A twin study of middle-aged men. ''Neuropsychology'', ''21''(5), 569-580. {{doi|10.1037/0894-4105.21.5.569}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Broadly speaking, a '''risk assessment''' is the combined effort of 1. identifying and analyzing potential (future) events that may negatively impact individuals, assets, and/or the environment (i.e., risk analysis); and 2. making judgments "on the tolerability of the risk on the basis of a risk analysis" while considering influencing factors (i.e., risk evaluation).&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT21 |chapter=Chapter 1: Introduction |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–28 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zqjLCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA2 |chapter=Chapter 1: Risk Assessments: Their Significance and the Role of the Safety Professional |title=Risk Assessment: A Practical Guide to Assessing Operational Risks |author=Manuele, F.A. |editor=Popov, G.; Lyon, B.K.; Hollcraft, B.  |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=1–22 |year=2016 |isbn=9781118911044}}&lt;/ref&gt; Put in simpler terms, a risk assessment analyzes what can go wrong, how likely it is to happen, what the potential consequences are, and how tolerable the identified risk is.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As part of this process, the resulting determination of risk may be expressed in a [[Quantitative property|quantitative]] or [[Qualitative data|qualitative]] fashion. The risk assessment plays an inherent part of an overall [[risk management]] strategy, which attempts to, after a risk assessment, "introduce control measures to eliminate or reduce" any potential risk-related consequences.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt;

== Need ==
===Individual risk assessment===
Risk assessment is necessary in individual cases, including patient and physician interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sbu.se/contentassets/e7039ddba84c4eca9b474d6b15c9c9ac/vop_eng_18_180521_lr.pdf|title=Getting Real About Both Benefits and Risks|last=Levi|first=Ragnar|date=June 1, 2018|website=Swedish Agency of Health Technology Assessment and Assessment of Social Services|pages=8–9|language=en|via=[https://www.sbu.se/en/publications/medical-science-and-practice/new-issue-sbu-newsletter-medical-science-and-practice/ Science &amp; Practice, English Special 2018]|issn=1104-1250|access-date=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual judgements or assessments of risk may be affected by psychological, ideological, religious or otherwise subjective factors, which impact rationality of the process.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A [[systematic review]] of patients and doctors from 2017 found that overstatement of benefits and understatement of risks occurred more often than the alternative.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffmann|first=Tammy C.|last2=Del Mar|first2=Chris|year=2015|title=Patients' expectations of the benefits and harms of treatments, screening, and tests: a systematic review|journal=JAMA Internal Medicine|volume=175|issue=2|pages=274–286|doi=10.1001/jamainternmed.2014.6016|issn=2168-6114|pmid=25531451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a tendency for individuals to be less rational when risks and exposures concern themselves as opposed to others.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is also a tendency to underestimate risks that are voluntary or where the individual sees themselves as being in control, such as smoking.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A 2017 systematic review from the [[Cochrane (organisation)|Cochrane collaboration]] suggests “well-documented decision aids” are helpful in reducing effects of such tendencies or biases.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stacey|first=Dawn|last2=Légaré|first2=France|last3=Lewis|first3=Krystina|last4=Barry|first4=Michael J.|last5=Bennett|first5=Carol L.|last6=Eden|first6=Karen B.|last7=Holmes-Rovner|first7=Margaret|last8=Llewellyn-Thomas|first8=Hilary|last9=Lyddiatt|first9=Anne|date=12 April 2017|title=Decision aids for people facing health treatment or screening decisions|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=4|pages=CD001431|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001431.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28402085}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways statistics are expressed and communicated, both through words and numerically also impact the interpretation of benefit and harm. For example, a fatality rate may be interpreted as less benign than the corresponding survival rate.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Systems risk assessment===
Risk assessment can also be made on a much larger "systems" scale, for example assessing the risks of a nuclear power plant (an interactively complex mechanical, electronic, nuclear, and human system) or a hurricane (a complex meteorological and geographical system). Systems may be defined as linear and nonlinear (or complex), where linear systems are predictable and relatively easy to understand given a change in input, and non-linear systems unpredictable when inputs are changed.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13-6"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9EHeLmbUVh8C&amp;pg=PT166 |chapter=Chapter 6: Accident Models |title=Risk Assessment: Theory, Methods, and Applications |author=Rausand, M. |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |pages=137–76 |year=2013 |isbn=9780470637647}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, risk assessments of non-linear/complex systems tend to be more challenging.

In the engineering of complex systems, sophisticated risk assessments are often made within [[safety engineering]] and [[reliability engineering]] when it concerns threats to life, [[Natural environment|environment]], or machine functioning. The agriculture, nuclear, aerospace, oil, railroad, and military industries have a long history of dealing with risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16"&gt;{{cite book |title=Critical Infrastructures: Risk and Vulnerability Assessment in Transportation of Dangerous Goods: Transportation by Road and Rail |author=Vamanu, B.I.; Gheorghe, A.V.; Kaina, P.F. |publisher=Springer |page=11 |year=2016 |isbn=9783319309316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, medical, hospital, [[social services|social service]],&lt;ref name="LaceyAnApp11"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lacey |first=Peter |title=An Application of Fault Tree Analysis to the Identification and Management of Risks in Government Funded Human Service Delivery |journal=Proceedings of the 2nd International Conference on Public Policy and Social Sciences |year=2011 |ssrn=2171117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and food industries control risks and perform risk assessments on a continual basis. Methods for assessment of risk may differ between industries and whether it pertains to general financial decisions or environmental, ecological, or public health risk assessment.&lt;ref name="VamanuCritical16" /&gt;

== Concept ==
Rapid technological change, increasing scale of industrial complexes, increased system integration, market competition, and other factors have been shown to increase societal risk in the past few decades.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; As such, risk assessments become increasingly critical in mitigating accidents, improving safety, and improving outcomes. Risk assessment consists of an objective evaluation of [[risk]] in which assumptions and uncertainties are clearly considered and presented. This involves identification of risk (what can happen and why), the potential consequences, the [[Outcome (probability)|probability of occurrence]], the tolerability or acceptability of the risk, and ways to mitigate or reduce probability of the risk.&lt;ref name="PopovRisk16" /&gt; Optimally, it also involves documentation of the risk assessment and its findings, implementation of mitigation methods, and review of the assessment (or risk management plan), coupled with updates when necessary.&lt;ref name="RausandRisk13" /&gt; Sometimes risks can be deemed acceptable, meaning the risk "is understood and tolerated ... usually because the cost or difficulty of implementing an effective countermeasure for the associated vulnerability exceeds the expectation of loss."&lt;ref name="ShireyInternet07"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4949 |title=Internet Security Glossary, Version 2 |author=Shirey, R. |work=Network Working Group |publisher=The IETF Trust |page=9 |date=August 2007 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the difficulty in managing risk is that both the quantities by which risk assessment is concerned—potential loss and probability of occurrence—can be very difficult to measure. The chance of error in measuring these two concepts is high. Risk with a large potential loss and a low probability of occurrence is often treated differently from one with a low potential loss and a high likelihood of occurrence. In theory, both are of near equal priority, but in practice it can be very difficult to manage when faced with the scarcity of resources—especially time—in which to conduct the risk management process.

===Mathematical conceptualization===
[[Image:RiskAssessment.jpg|thumb|320px|Risk assessment from a financial point of view.]]
To see the risk management process expressed mathematically, one can define total risk as the sum over individual risks, &lt;math&gt;R_i&lt;/math&gt;, which can be computed as the product of potential losses, &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, and their probabilities, &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt;R_i=L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{total}=\sum_i L_i p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
Even though for some risks &lt;math&gt;R_i, R_j&lt;/math&gt;, we might have &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, if the probability &lt;math&gt;p(L_j)&lt;/math&gt; is small compared to &lt;math&gt;p(L_i)&lt;/math&gt;, its estimation might be based only on a smaller number of prior events, and hence, more uncertain. On the other hand, since &lt;math&gt;R_i = R_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;L_j&lt;/math&gt; must be larger than &lt;math&gt;L_i&lt;/math&gt;, so decisions based on this uncertainty would be more consequential, and hence, warrant a different approach.

Financial decisions, such as insurance, express loss in terms of dollar amounts.  When risk assessment is used for public health or environmental decisions, loss can be quantified in a common metric such as a country's currency or some numerical measure of a location's quality of life.  For public health and environmental decisions, loss is simply a verbal description of the outcome, such as increased cancer incidence or incidence of birth defects. In that case, the "risk" is expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;R_i= p(L_i)\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
If the risk estimate takes into account information on the number of individuals exposed, it is termed a "population risk" and is in units of expected increased cases per a time period. If the risk estimate does not take into account the number of individuals exposed, it is termed an "individual risk" and is in units of incidence rate per a time period.  Population risks are of more use for cost/benefit analysis; individual risks are of more use for evaluating whether risks to individuals are "acceptable".

====Quantitative risk assessment====
{{Further|Quantitative Risk Assessment software}}
In quantitative risk assessment an [[annualized loss expectancy]] (ALE) may be used to justify the cost of implementing countermeasures to protect an asset. This may be calculated by multiplying the [[single loss expectancy]] (SLE), which is the loss of value based on a single security incident, with the [[annualized rate of occurrence]] (ARO), which is an estimate of how often a threat would be successful in exploiting a vulnerability.

The usefulness of quantitative risk assessment has been questioned, however. [[Barry Commoner]], [[Brian Wynne]] and other critics have expressed concerns that risk assessment tends to be overly quantitative and reductive. For example, they argue that risk assessments ignore qualitative differences among risks. Some charge that assessments may drop out important non-quantifiable or inaccessible information, such as variations among the classes of people exposed to hazards, or social amplification.&lt;ref name="Kasperson"&gt;{{cite journal |author= Kasperson, R.E., Renn, O., Slovic, P., Brown, H.S., Emel, J., Goble, R., Kasperson, J.X., Ratick, S.| year=1988 | title = The social amplification of risk: A conceptual framework|journal= Risk Analysis|volume=8|issue=2|pages=177–187|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.1988.tb01168.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Commoner and O'Brien claim that quantitative approaches divert attention from precautionary or preventative measures.&lt;ref&gt;Commoner, Barry. O'Brien, Mary. Shrader-Frechette and Westra 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Others, like [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] consider risk managers little more than "blind users" of statistical tools and methods.&lt;ref&gt;The fourth quadrant: a map of the limits of statistics [9.15.08] Nassim Nicholas Taleb An Edge Original Essay&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessment of risk ==
The process of risk assessment may be somewhat informal at the individual social level, managing economic and household risks,&lt;ref name="HolzmannSocial01"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Social Risk Management: A New Conceptual Framework for Social Protection, and Beyond |journal=International Tax and Public Finance |author=Holzmann, R.; Jørgensen, S. |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=529–56 |year=2001 |doi=10.1023/A:1011247814590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NakašThree17"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://knowledgehub.cef-see.org/?p=1399 |title=Three Lessons About Risk Management from Everyday Life |author=Nakaš, N. |work=Knowledge Hub |publisher=Center of Excellence in Finance |date=21 November 2017 |accessdate=19 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a sophisticate process at the strategic corporal level. However, in both cases, ability to anticipate future events and create effective strategies for mitigating them when deemed unacceptable is vital.

At the individual level, a simple process of identifying objectives and risks, weighing their importance and creating plans, may be all that's necessary. At the strategic organisational level, more elaborate policies are necessary, specifying acceptable levels of risk, procedures to be followed within the organisation, priorities, and allocation of resources.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;{{rp|10}} At the systematic level, management involved with the project produce project level risk assessments with the assistance of the available expertise as part of the planning process, and set up systems to ensure that required actions to manage the assessed risk are in place. At the dynamic level, the personnel directly involved may be required to deal with unforeseen problems in real time. The tactical decisions made at this level should be reviewed after the operation to provide feedback on the effectiveness of both the planned procedures and decisions made in response to the contingency.

The first step in risk assessment is to establish the context. This restricts the range of hazards to be considered.

This is followed by ''identification of visible and implied hazards'' that may threaten the project, and ''determining the qualitative nature of the potential adverse consequences'' of each hazard. Without a potential adverse consequence, there is no hazard.

It is also necessary to identify the potential parties or assets which may be affected by the threat, and the potential consequences to them if the hazard is activated.

If the consequences are dependent on dose, i.e. the amount of exposure, the relationship between dose and severity of consequence must be established, and the risk depends on the probable dose, which may depend on concentration or amplitude and duration or frequency of exposure. This is the general case for many health hazards where the mechanism of injury is toxicity or repetitive injury, particularly where the effect is cumulative.

For other hazards, the consequences may either occur or not, and the severity may be extremely variable even when the triggering conditions are the same. This is typical of many biological hazards as well as a large range of safety hazards. Exposure to a pathogen may or may not result in actual infection, and the consequences of infection may also be variable. Similarly a fall from the same place may result in minor injury or death, depending on unpredictable details. In these cases estimates must be made of reasonably likely consequences and associated probability of occurrence.

In cases where statistical records are available they may be used to evaluate risk, but in many cases there are no data or insufficient data available to be useful. Mathematical or experimental models may provide useful input.

=== Dose dependent risk ===
[[Image:Risk Based Sampling Nomogram (3yr).png|right|200px|thumb|Food risk assessment [[nomogram]]]]

#''Dose-Response Analysis'', is determining the relationship between dose and the type of adverse response and/or probability or the incidence of effect (dose-response assessment). The complexity of this step in many contexts derives mainly from the need to extrapolate results from experimental animals (e.g. [[mouse]], [[rat]]) to humans, and/or from high to lower doses, including from high acute occupational levels to low chronic environmental levels. In addition, the differences between individuals due to [[genetics]] or other factors mean that the hazard may be higher for particular groups, called susceptible populations. An alternative to dose-response estimation is to determine a concentration unlikely to yield observable effects, that is, a [[no effect concentration]]. In developing such a dose, to account for the largely unknown effects of animal to human extrapolations, increased variability in humans, or missing data, a prudent approach is often adopted by including safety or uncertainty factors in the estimate of the "safe" dose, typically a factor of 10 for each unknown step.
#''Exposure Quantification'', aims to determine the amount of a contaminant (dose) that individuals and populations will receive, either as a contact level (e.g., concentration in ambient air) or as intake (e.g., daily dose ingested from drinking water). This is done by examining the results of the discipline of [[exposure assessment]]. As different location, lifestyles and other factors likely influence the amount of contaminant that is received, a range or distribution of possible values is generated in this step. Particular care is taken to determine the exposure of the susceptible population(s).

The results of these steps are combined to produce an estimate of risk. Because of the different susceptibilities and exposures, this risk will vary within a population. An uncertainty analysis is usually included in a health risk assessment.

== Dynamic risk assessment ==
During an emergency response, the situation and hazards are often inherently less predictable than for planned activities (non-linear). In general, if the situation and hazards are predictable (linear), standard operating procedures should deal with them adequately. In some emergencies this may also hold true, with the prepared and trained responses being adequate to manage the situation. In these situations, the operator can manage risk without outside assistance, or with the assistance of a backup team who are prepared and available to step in at short notice.

Other emergencies occur where there is no previously planned protocol, or when an outsider group is brought in to handle the situation, and they are not specifically prepared for the scenario that exists but must deal with it without undue delay. Examples include police, fire department, disaster response and other public service rescue teams. In these cases ongoing risk assessment by the involved personnel can advise appropriate action to reduce risk.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt; HM Fire Services Inspectorate has defined dynamic risk assessment (DRA) as:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The continuous assessment of risk in the rapidly changing circumstances of an operational incident, in order to implement the control measures necessary to ensure an acceptable level of safety.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lock|first1=Gareth|editor1-last=Phillips|editor1-first=Mark|title=Public Safety Diving-Dynamic Risk Assessment|journal=PS Diver Magazine|date=June 2017|issue=116|page=9|url=http://psdiver.com/images/PSDiver_Issue_116_-_SECURE.pdf|accessdate=20 June 2017|publisher=PSDiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dynamic risk assessment is the final stage of an integrated safety management system which can provide appropriate response during changing circumstances. It relies on experience, training and continuing education, including effective debriefing to analyse not only what went wrong, but also what went right, and why, and to share this with other members of the team and the personnel responsible for the planning level risk assessment.&lt;ref name="Lock 2017" /&gt;

==Fields of application==
Application of risk assessment procedures is common in a wide range of fields, and these may have specific legal obligations, codes of practice and standardised procedures. Some of these are listed here.

=== General health ===
There are many resources that provide health risk information.

The [[National Library of Medicine]] provides risk assessment and regulation information tools for a varied audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment and Regulation Information from the NLM|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro/riskinformation.html|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:
* TOXNET (databases on hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Databases on toxicology, hazardous chemicals, environmental health, and toxic releases|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov|work=TOXNET|publisher=[[National Library of Medicine|NLM]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the Household Products Database (potential health effects of chemicals in over 10,000 common household products),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Household Products Database|url=http://hpd.nlm.nih.gov/|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[TOXMAP]] (maps of the [[Superfund|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Superfund]] and [[Toxics Release Inventory]] data).
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] provides basic information about environmental health risk assessments for the public for a wide variety of possible environmental exposures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Risk Assessment Portal|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]|accessdate=9 June 2013|date=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Environmental Protection Agency began actively using risk assessment methods to protect drinking water in the United States after passage of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974. The law required the National Academy of Sciences to conduct a study on drinking water issues, and in its report the NAS described some methodologies for doing risk assessments for chemicals that were suspected carcinogens, recommendations that top EPA officials have described as perhaps the study’s most important part.&lt;ref&gt;EPA Alumni Association: Senior EPA officials discuss early implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1974, [http://www.epaalumni.org/history/video/interview.cfm?id=13 Video], [http://www.epaalumni.org/userdata/pdf/6014106B36AE81EB.pdf#page=11 Transcript] (see pages 11,14).&lt;/ref&gt;

Considering the increase in junk food and its toxicity, FDA required in 1973 that cancer-causing compounds must not be present in meat at concentrations that would cause a cancer risk greater than 1 in a million over a lifetime. The US Environmental Protection Agency provides extensive information about ecological and environmental risk assessments for the public via its risk assessment portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/risk/|title=Risk Assessment|last=EPA, ORD, NCEA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stockholm Convention]] on [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) supports a qualitative risk framework for public health protection from chemicals that display environmental and biological persistence, [[bioaccumulation]], toxicity (PBT) and long range transport; most global chemicals that meet this criteria have been previously assessed quantitatively by national and international health agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szabo DT, Loccisano AE |title= POPs and Human Health Risk Assessment|journal=Dioxins and Persistent Organic Pollutants |volume=3rd |issue=Edition |pages=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=March 30, 2012| doi= 10.1002/9781118184141.ch19 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781118184141.ch19/summary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Small sub-populations ====
When risks apply mainly to small sub-populations, there is uncertainty at which point intervention is necessary. For example, there may be a risk that is very low for everyone, other than 0.1% of the population. It is necessary to determine whether this 0.1% is represented by:
* all infants younger than ''X'' days or
* recreational users of a particular product.

If the risk is higher for a particular sub-population because of abnormal exposure rather than susceptibility, strategies to further reduce the exposure of that subgroup are considered.  If an identifiable sub-population is more susceptible due to inherent genetic or other factors, public policy choices must be made. The choices are:
* to set policies for protecting the general population that are protective of such groups, e.g. for children when data exists, the Clean Air Act for populations such as asthmatics or
* not to set policies, because the group is too small, or the costs too high.

==== Acceptable risk criteria ====
The idea of not increasing lifetime risk by more than one in a million has become commonplace in public health discourse and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/water_sanitation_health/dwq/iwachap10.pdf|title=Acceptable Risk|first1=Paul R.|last1=Hunter|first2=Lorna|last2=Fewtrell|publisher=''[[World Health Organization]]''|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a heuristic measure. It provides a numerical basis for establishing a negligible increase in risk.

Environmental decision making allows some discretion for deeming individual risks potentially "acceptable" if less than one in ten thousand chance of increased lifetime risk.  Low risk criteria such as these provide some protection for a case where individuals may be exposed to multiple chemicals e.g. pollutants, food additives or other chemicals.

In practice, a true zero-risk is possible only with the suppression of the risk-causing activity.

Stringent requirements of 1 in a million may not be technologically feasible or may be so prohibitively expensive as to render the risk-causing activity unsustainable, resulting in the optimal degree of intervention being a balance between risks vs. benefit. For example, emissions from hospital incinerators result in a certain number of deaths per year. However, this risk must be balanced against the alternatives.  There are public health risks, as well as economic costs, associated with all options. The risk associated with no [[incineration]] is potential spread of infectious diseases, or even no hospitals. Further investigation identifies options such as separating noninfectious from infectious wastes, or air pollution controls on a medical incinerator.

Intelligent thought about a reasonably full set of options is essential.  Thus, it is not unusual for there to be an iterative process between analysis, consideration of options, and follow up analysis.

===Auditing===
For audits performed by an outside audit firm, risk assessment is a crucial stage before accepting an audit engagement. According to ISA315 ''Understanding the Entity and its Environment and Assessing the Risks of Material Misstatement'', "the auditor should perform risk assessment procedures to obtain an understanding of the entity and its environment, including its internal control". Evidence relating to the auditor’s risk assessment of a material misstatement in the client’s financial statements. Then, the auditor obtains initial evidence regarding the classes of transactions at the client and the operating effectiveness of the client’s internal controls. Audit risk is defined as the risk that the auditor will issue a clean unmodified opinion regarding the financial statements, when in fact the financial statements are materially misstated, and therefore do not qualify for a clean unmodified opinion. As a formula, audit risk is the product of two other risks: Risk of Material Misstatement and Detection risk. This formula can be further broken down as follows:  [[inherent risk]] × [[control risk]] × [[detection risk]].

=== Public health ===
In the context of [[public health]], risk assessment is the process of characterizing the nature and likelihood of a harmful effect to individuals or populations from certain human activities. Health risk assessment can be mostly qualitative or can include statistical estimates of probabilities for specific populations. In most countries the use of specific chemicals or the operations of specific facilities (e.g. power plants, manufacturing plants) is not allowed unless it can be shown that they do not increase the risk of death or illness above a specific threshold. For example, the American [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates food safety through risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;Merrill, Richard A. "Food Safety Regulation: Reforming the Delaney Clause" in ''Annual Review of Public Health'', 1997, 18:313-40. This source includes a useful historical survey of prior food safety regulation.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project management===
In [[project management]], risk assessment is an integral part of the risk management plan, studying the probability, the impact, and the effect of every known risk on the project, as well as the corrective action to take should an incident implied by a risk occur.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmhut.com/managing-project-risks Managing Project Risks] - Retrieved May 20th, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Of special consideration in this area are the relevant codes of practice that are enforced in the specific jurisdiction. Understanding the regime of regulations that risk management must abide by is integral to formulating safe and compliant risk assessment practices.

=== Information security ===
{{Main|IT risk management#Risk assessment}}

[[IT risk|Information technology risk]] assessment can be performed by a qualitative or quantitative approach, following different methodologies. One important difference{{clarify|reason=difference from what?|date=June 2017}} in risk assessments in information security is modifying the threat model to account for the fact that any adversarial system connected to the Internet has access to threaten any other connected system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Global adversarial capability modeling|url = http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/icp.jsp?arnumber=7120797|journal = 2015 APWG Symposium on Electronic Crime Research (eCrime)|date = 2015-05-01|pages = 1–21|doi = 10.1109/ECRIME.2015.7120797|first = J.|last = Spring|first2 = S.|last2 = Kern|first3 = A.|last3 = Summers}}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk assessments may therefore need to be modified to account for the threats from all adversaries, instead of just those with reasonable access as is done in other fields.

Another notable difference is the strategic nature of IT risk assessments.  Unlike tactical vulnerability assessments and penetration testing which aim to identify and close specific gaps in security, IT risk assessments are functional at the executive level to examine the broader picture of IT risk management.{{clarify|reason=what does this actually mean|date=June 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arnold|first1=Rob|title=3 Types of Security Assessments|url=https://threatsketch.com/3-types-cyber-security-assessments/|website=Threat Sketch|publisher=Threat Sketch|accessdate=17 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Megaprojects ===
[[Megaprojects]] (sometimes also called "major programs") are extremely large-scale investment projects, typically costing more than US$1 billion per project. They include bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, airports, seaports, power plants, dams, wastewater projects, coastal flood protection, oil and natural gas extraction projects, public buildings, information technology systems, aerospace projects, and defence systems. Megaprojects have been shown to be particularly risky in terms of finance, safety, and social and environmental impacts.

=== Software evolution ===
Studies have shown that early parts of the system development cycle such as requirements and design specifications are especially prone to error. This effect is particularly notorious in projects involving multiple [[Project stakeholder|stakeholders]] with different points of view. Evolutionary software processes offer an iterative approach to [[Requirements engineering|requirement engineering]] to alleviate the problems of uncertainty, ambiguity and inconsistency inherent in software developments.{{clarify|reason=What does this have to do with risk assessment?|date=June 2017}}

=== Shipping industry ===
In July 2010, shipping companies agreed to use standardized procedures in order to assess risk in key shipboard operation. These procedures were implemented as part of the amended [[International Safety Management Code|ISM Code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISM CODE – Amendments from 1st July 2010 Risk Assessment |url=http://www1.veristar.com/veristar/dps_info.nsf/veristar/Dps_info.nsf/AllByDateInternal/353FC02A22D59873C1257734003EC51C?opendocument}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Underwater diving ===
{{see also|List of diving hazards and precautions}}
Formal risk assessment is a required component of most [[Professional diving|professional dive planning]], but the format and methodology may vary. Consequences of an incident due to an identified hazard are generally chosen from a small number of standardised categories, and probability is estimated based on statistical data on the rare occasions when it is available, and on a best guess estimate based on personal experience and company policy in most cases. A simple matrix is often used to transform these inputs into a level of risk, generally expressed as unacceptable, marginal or acceptable. If unacceptable, measures must be taken to reduce the risk to an acceptable level, and the final outcome of the risk assessment must be accepted by the affected parties before a dive commences. Higher levels of risk may be acceptable in special circumstances, such as military or search and rescue operations when there is a chance of recovering a survivor. [[Diving supervisor]]s are trained in the procedures of [[hazard identification and risk assessment]], and it is part of their planning and operational responsibility. Both health and safety hazards must be considered. Several stages may be identified. There is risk assessment done as part of the diving project planning, on site risk assessment which takes into account the specific conditions of the day, and [[dynamic risk assessment]] which is ongoing during the operation by the members of the dive team, particularly the supervisor and the working diver.&lt;ref name="SA Diving Regulations 2009"&gt;{{cite web |title=Diving Regulations 2009 |work=Occupational Health and Safety Act 85 of 1993 – Regulations and Notices – Government Notice R41 |url=http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |publisher=Government Printer |location=Pretoria |via=Southern African Legal Information Institute |accessdate=3 November 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161104080007/http://www.saflii.org/za/legis/consol_reg/ohasa85o1993rangnr41716/ |archivedate=4 November 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMCA D022 2016"&gt;{{cite book|last=Staff|first=|title=Guidance for diving supervisors IMCA D 022|edition=Revision 1|date=August 2016|publisher=International Marine Contractors Association|location=London, UK|pages=15{{hyphen}}5|chapter=15 - General safety requirements}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[recreational scuba diving]], the extent of risk assessment expected of the diver is relatively basic, and is included in the [[Buddy check|pre-dive checks]]. Several mnemonics have been developed by [[diver certification agencies]] to remind the diver to pay some attention to risk, but the training is rudimentary. Diving service providers are expected to provide a higher level of care for their customers, and [[diving instructor]]s and [[divemaster]]s are expected to assess risk on behalf of their customers and warn them of site-specific hazards and the competence considered appropriate for the planned dive. Technical divers are expected to make a more thorough assessment of risk, but as they will be making an informed choice for a recreational activity, the level of acceptable risk may be considerably higher than that permitted for occupational divers under the direction of an employer.&lt;ref name="Diving at Work Regulations 1997" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/2776/made |title=The Diving at Work Regulations 1997 |last=Staff |year=1977 |work=Statutory Instruments 1997 No. 2776 Health and Safety |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) |location=Kew, Richmond, Surrey |accessdate=6 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurr 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gurr|first=Kevin |editor-last=Mount |editor-first=Tom|editor2-last=Dituri |editor2-first=Joseph|title=Exploration and Mixed Gas Diving Encyclopedia|edition=1st|date=August 2008|publisher=International Association of Nitrox Divers|location=Miami Shores, Florida|isbn=978-0-915539-10-9|pages=165–180|chapter=13: Operational Safety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outdoor and wilderness adventure===
In outdoor activities including commercial outdoor education, wilderness expeditioning and [[Outdoor_recreation | outdoor recreation]], risk assessment refers to analysis of the probability and magnitude of unfavorable outcomes such as injury, illness, or property damage due to environmental and related causes, compared to the human development or other benefits of outdoor activity. This is of particular importance as school programs and others weigh the benefits of youth and adult participation in various outdoor learning activities against the inherent and other hazards present in those activities.  Schools, corporate entities seeking team-building experiences, parents/guardians, and others considering outdoor experiences expect or require&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nwais.org/uploaded/accreditation_resources/2018_Membership_AccredRubric.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; organizations to assess the hazards and risks of different outdoor activities—such as sailing, mountaineering, or camping—and select activities with acceptable risk profiles.

Outdoor education, wilderness adventure, and other outdoor-related organizations should, and are in some jurisdictions required, to conduct risk assessments prior to offering programs for commercial purposes&lt;ref&gt;http://www.supportadventure.co.nz/adventure-activities-regulations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/2016/0019/latest/DLM6725703.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/aala/&lt;/ref&gt;.

Such organizations are given guidance on how to provide their risk assessments&lt;ref&gt;https://worksafe.govt.nz/topic-and-industry/adventure-activities&lt;/ref&gt; and external consultancy services provide these assessments as well&lt;ref&gt;http://www.outdoorsafetyinstitute.com/pages/reviews/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.viristar.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nols.edu/en/about/risk-services/&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Environment ===
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) aims at assessing the effects of stressors, often chemicals, on the local environment. A risk is an integrated assessment of likelihood and severity of an undesired event. In ERA, the undesired event often depends on the chemical of interest and on the risk assessment scenario.&lt;ref name="Goussen et al 2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goussen|first=Benoit|last2=Price|first2=Oliver R.|last3=Rendal|first3=Cecilie|last4=Ashauer|first4=Roman|date=2016-10-26|title=Integrated presentation of ecological risk from multiple stressors|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep36004|journal=Scientific Reports|language=en|volume=6|doi=10.1038/srep36004|issn=2045-2322|pmc=5080554|pmid=27782171}}&lt;/ref&gt; This undesired event is usually a detrimental effect on organisms, populations or ecosystems. Current ERAs usually compare an exposure to a no-effect level, such as the [[Predicted environmental concentration|Predicted Environmental Concentration]]/[[Predicted no-effect concentration|Predicted No-Effect Concentration]] (PEC/PNEC) ratio in Europe. Although this type of ratio is useful and often used in regulation purposes, it is only an indication of an exceeded apparent threshold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jager|first=Tjalling|last2=Heugens|first2=Evelyn H.

=== Biodiversity ===
Biodiversity Risk Assessments evaluate risks to [[biological diversity]], specially the risk of [[species]] [[extinction]] or the risk of [[ecosystem collapse]]. The units of assessments are the biological (species, [[subspecies]] or [[population]]s) or ecological entities ([[habitat]]s, [[ecosystem]]s, etc), and the risk are often related to human actions and interventions (threats and pressures). Regional and national protocols have been proposed by multiple academic or governmental institutions and working groups,&lt;ref name="NicholsonRegan2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nicholson|first1=Emily|last2=Regan|first2=Tracey J.|last3=Auld|first3=Tony D.|last4=Burns|first4=Emma L.|last5=Chisholm|first5=Laurie A.|last6=English|first6=Valerie|last7=Harris|first7=Stephen|last8=Harrison|first8=Peter|last9=Kingsford|first9=Richard T.|last10=Leishman|first10=Michelle R.|last11=Metcalfe|first11=Daniel J.|last12=Pisanu|first12=Phil|last13=Watson|first13=Christopher J.|last14=White|first14=Matthew|last15=White|first15=Matt D.|last16=Williams|first16=Richard J.|last17=Wilson|first17=Bruce|last18=Keith|first18=David A.|title=Towards consistency, rigour and compatibility of risk assessments for ecosystems and ecological communities|journal=Austral Ecology|volume=40|issue=4|year=2015|pages=347–363|issn=14429985|doi=10.1111/aec.12148}}&lt;/ref&gt; but global standards such as the [[Red List of Threatened Species]] and the [[IUCN Red List of Ecosystems]] have been widely adopted, and are recognized or proposed as official indicators of progress toward international policy targets and goals, such as the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|Aichi targets]] and the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="KeithRodríguez2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keith|first1=David A.|last2=Rodríguez|first2=Jon Paul|last3=Brooks|first3=Thomas M.|last4=Burgman|first4=Mark A.|last5=Barrow|first5=Edmund G.|last6=Bland|first6=Lucie|last7=Comer|first7=Patrick J.|last8=Franklin|first8=Janet|last9=Link|first9=Jason|last10=McCarthy|first10=Michael A.|last11=Miller|first11=Rebecca M.|last12=Murray|first12=Nicholas J.|last13=Nel|first13=Jeanne|last14=Nicholson|first14=Emily|last15=Oliveira-Miranda|first15=María A.|last16=Regan|first16=Tracey J.|last17=Rodríguez-Clark|first17=Kathryn M.|last18=Rouget|first18=Mathieu|last19=Spalding|first19=Mark D.|title=The IUCN Red List of Ecosystems: Motivations, Challenges, and Applications|journal=Conservation Letters|volume=8|issue=3|year=2015|pages=214–226|issn=1755263X|doi=10.1111/conl.12167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BrooksButchart2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Thomas M.|last2=Butchart|first2=Stuart H.M.|last3=Cox|first3=Neil A.|last4=Heath|first4=Melanie|last5=Hilton-Taylor|first5=Craig|last6=Hoffmann|first6=Michael|last7=Kingston|first7=Naomi|last8=Rodríguez|first8=Jon Paul|last9=Stuart|first9=Simon N.|last10=Smart|first10=Jane|title=Harnessing biodiversity and conservation knowledge products to track the Aichi Targets and Sustainable Development Goals|journal=Biodiversity|volume=16|issue=2-3|year=2015|pages=157–174|issn=1488-8386|doi=10.1080/14888386.2015.1075903}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rotary feeders''', also known as '''rotary airlocks''' or '''rotary valves''', are commonly used in industrial and agricultural applications as a component in a bulk or specialty material handling system. Rotary feeders are primarily used for discharge of bulk solid material from [[Chute (gravity)|hopper]]s/bins, receivers, and cyclones into a pressure or vacuum-driven pneumatic conveying system. Components of a rotary feeder include a rotor shaft, housing, head plates, and [[packing seal]]s and [[Bearing (mechanical)|bearing]]s.
Rotors have large vanes cast or welded on and are typically driven by small [[internal combustion engine]]s or [[electric motor]]s.

==Use==
Rotary airlock feeders have wide application in industry wherever dry free-flowing powders, granules, crystals, or pellets are used. Typical materials include: cement, ore, sugar, minerals, grains, plastics, dust, [[fly ash]], flour, [[gypsum]], [[Lime (material)|lime]], coffee, cereals, pharmaceuticals, etc.

Industries requiring this type include cement, asphalt, chemical, mining, plastics, food, etc.

Rotary feeders are ideal for pollution control applications in wood, grain, food, textile, paper, tobacco, rubber, and paint industries, the Standard Series works beneath dust collectors and cyclone separators even with high temperatures and different pressure differentials.
 
Rotary valves are available with square or round inlet and outlet flanges. Housing can be fabricated out of sheet material or cast.  Common materials are [[cast iron]], [[carbon steel]], 304 SS, 316 SS, and other materials.
Rotary airlock feeders are often available in standard and heavy duty models, the difference being the head plate and bearing configuration.  Heavy duty models use an outboard bearing in which the bearings are moved out away from the head plate.
Housing inlet and discharge configurations are termed drop-thru or side entry.
Different wear protections are available such as hard chrome or ceramic plating on the inner housing surfaces.
Grease and air purge fittings are often provided to prevent contaminants from entering the packing seals.

==Uses==

*'''Rotary airlock'''
The basic use of the rotary airlock feeder is as an airlock transition point, sealing pressurized systems against loss of air or gas while maintaining a flow of material between components with different pressure and suitable for air lock applications ranging from gravity discharge of filters, rotary valves, cyclone dust collectors, and rotary airlock storage devices to precision feeders for dilute phase and continuous dense phase pneumatic convey systems.

*'''Rotary valve'''
Rotary airlock feeders/ rotary airlock valves are used in pneumatic conveying systems, dust control equipment, and as volumetric feed-controls.

*'''Volumetric feeder'''
Rotary airlock valves are also widely used as volumetric feeders for metering materials at precise flow rates from bins, hoppers, or silos onto conveying or processing systems.

==Types==

===Angle of Repose rotary Feeders===
ARF is a variable speed rotary feeder for bulk materials that works in harmony with the natural flow of the material being fed.  The ARF, using a rotating member and articulable gate, controls the volume of material flow based on the material's inherent angle of repose.  The speed of rotation and the positioning of the articulable gate provides a consistent feed of your material.  Drum rotation allows the material to be gently fed without retarding material flow, while minimizing surge loading, product degradation, dust generation and maintaining uniformity of material flow.

===Rotary airlock feeders===
Drop through rotary airlock feeders are designed for rugged applications that require an outboard bearing style unit where contamination and /or an abrasive product cannot be handled with an inboard bearing style.
The outboard bearing feeders is engineered for use in high pressure pneumatic conveying systems, with high temperatures where more of an effective seal is required due to high or excessive wear that is experienced with a simple [[dust collector]].

===Blow-thru rotary airlock feeder===
The blow-thru rotary airlock feeder is ideal for pneumatic conveying applications in food, grain, chemical, milling, baking, plastics and pharmaceutical industries. The blow-thru airlocks feature a low profile with large capacity. High pressure differentials integral mounting feet, and retrofit competitive units. The blow-thru valves are available with 10-vane open-end rotor; outboard bearings and replaceable shaft seals.

===Rotary airlock feeder degassing===
Rotary airlock feeders are very often installed to dose material in a pneumatic conveying line. As a consequence, a lot of gas coming from the conveying line is brought upstream by the rotation of the valve and the leakages in between the rotor and the stator. In order to have a functional system and a good flow of material, a small hopper equipped with a filter is very often connected to the feeder. The air can then be vented and the product admitted to the valve&lt;ref&gt;http://www.powderprocess.net/Equipments%20html/Airlock_Rotary_Valve.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Easy clean rotary feeder ===
&lt;!--[[Image:Rotary Feeder Easy Clean Zellenradschleuse Schnell Demontierbar 02.jpg|thumb|Easy Clean Rotary Feeder]]--&gt;

The easy-clean series rotary feeders can be fast and simply disassembled, thoroughly quick cleaned, sanitized and inspected or maintenance in a minimum amount of time without the use of tools or removal from service, thereby reducing downtime and increasing system production. Reassembly without tools is accomplished in minutes. Internal clearances are automatically re-established every time.

The [[Clean-in-place]] rotary feeder is a special purpose valve designed for where cross-contamination is a major concern and lengthy shut-downs for clean-out are cost-prohibitive, suited for Dairy, Pharmaceutical industries, Food, Baking, Chemical, Plastics, Paint, and Powder Coating plants.

It is ideal for batch mixing systems such as those handling different colored resins which demand regular cleaning between cycles.

=== Filter valve ===
The filter valve is a low-cost solution designed for light duty dust collector applications.

=== Knife rotary feeder ===

This type of feeder  is used for discharge of secondary fuel as for example: plastics or wood. The knife is cutting the oversize material and is preventing the rotor from blockage.

In the domain of [[systems engineering]], '''Specialty Engineering''' is defined as and includes the engineering disciplines that are not typical of the main engineering effort.  More common engineering efforts in systems engineering such as [[Electronic hardware|hardware]], [[software]], and human factors engineering may be used as major elements in a majority of systems engineering efforts and therefore are not viewed as "special".  

Examples of specialty engineering include [[electromagnetic interference]], safety, and physical security.&lt;ref&gt;Eisner, Howard. (2002). "Essentials of Project and Systems Engineering Management". Wiley. p.217.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less common engineering domains such as electromagnetic interference, [[electrical grounding]], safety, security, electrical power filtering/uninterruptible supply, manufacturability, and environmental engineering may be included in systems engineering efforts where they have been identified to address special system implementations. These less common but just as important engineering efforts are then viewed as "specialty engineering".

However, if the specific system has a standard implementation of environmental or security for example, the situation is reversed and the human factors engineering or hardware/software engineering may be the "specialty engineering" domain. 

The key take away is; the context of the system engineering project and unique needs of the project are fundamental when thinking of what are the specialty engineering efforts.  

The benefit of citing "specialty engineering" in planning is the notice to all team levels that special management and science factors may need to be accounted for and may influence the project.

Specialty engineering may be cited by commercial entities and others to specify their unique abilities.

'''Students of Sustainability (SoS)''' is an annual conference of the Australian student environment and social justice movement and predates the [[Australian Student Environment Network]] (ASEN). The first Students of Sustainability conference was held at ANU in 1991 when it was called Students, Science and Sustainability. The name changed in 1995 to Students and Sustainability and then again in 2003 to Students of Sustainability. In each case the name changes were to make the conference open to a wider range of participants.   Students of Sustainability always runs in July co-currently with [[NAIDOC_Week|NAIDOC week]], Aboriginal and Islander politics and affairs play a major part in the SOS program.

==History==
The conference began in Canberra in 1991 under the name 'Students, Science and Sustainability'. This first conference (April 24–26, 1991) attracted more than 300 students from every Australian State and Territory to discuss matters of sustainability with respect to students and science. This first conference was organised by a small group of ANU undergraduates, including John Reynolds, Padma Raman, Tristan Armstrong, Naomi Flutter and Joely-Kym Sobott, among others. One of the many high profile speakers was the late Australian historian Manning Clark AC. 
Since then, interest and enthusiasm for the conference has grown, and the number of participants has steadily increased. As SoS moves around the country, it spreads its unique, life-affirming, change-making energy to the University and community that hosts it.

==Description==
From the website [http://www.studentsofsustainability.org www.studentsofsustainability.org] which is run by the hosting crew each year:

'''Aims of SoS'''
•  to inspire ecologically sustainable practices as an alternative - to current societal values 
•  to empower individuals and groups to bring about positive social and political change through open forums, skill sharing opportunities 
•  to create national and international networks of environmentally-minded people 
•  to integrate environmentalism with other progressive movements such as human rights and cultural awareness movements 
•  and to create a conference that is accessible to as many people as possible.

'''Organise''' - The SoS organising committee advocates supportive, respectful and constructive involvement in all aspects of the conference. All participants share their knowledge and learn from each other, bringing their own opinions, voices and ideas. This diversity of voices, ideas and opinions makes SoS what it is.

'''''The Making of the Pentateuch''''' ("The Making of the Pentateuch: A Methodological Study", JSOT Press, Sheffield, 1987) by [[R. N. Whybray]], Professor of Hebrew and Old Testament Studies at the University of Hull (UK), was a major contribution to the field of Old Testament studies, and specifically to theories on the origins and composition of the Pentateuch. Its originality lay in its detailed critique of the [[documentary hypothesis]], and it remains a standard text on many reading lists.

== Background ==
For almost a century prior to Whybray's book, a scholarly consensus had developed regarding the question of Pentateuchal origins{{snd}} the composition and dates of the first five books of the [[Old Testament]]. In the closing decades of the 19th century [[Julius Wellhausen]] published ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'', in which he had set out the definitive version of the historical development of the [[Hebrew bible]]. According to this hypothesis, the [[Pentateuch]]{{snd}} [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]], [[Book of Numbers|Numbers]] and [[Deuteronomy]]{{snd}} was originally four separate documents, retelling the same episodes and stories, but with differing emphases designed to further the theological and political agendas of their authors. Their combination by a [[Redactor]] (editor) into a single narrative spread over five books had resulted in many inconsistencies and repetitious stories, which could be analysed through the methodology of [[source criticism]] to reconstruct the original documents.

Wellhausen had concentrated exclusively on the written text of the Pentateuch, but in the next generation [[Hermann Gunkel]] developed [[form criticism]], a methodology which he claimed could identify the various genres which had contributed to the text and thus reconstruct its [[tradition history]]. Gunkel and his followers, notably [[Martin Noth]], used this new methodology to discover the oral [[saga]]s which formed the basis of the written texts of the Pentateuch.

By the middle of the 20th century, Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis, the tradition history of Gunkel and Noth, and the [[Biblical archaeology]] of [[William F. Albright]], who claimed to have found physical proof of the 2nd millennium BC origins of Genesis, Exodus, and the other books of the Pentateuch, had merged to form a dominant paradigm, or consensual view, of the origins of the Pentateuch{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}. It was this paradigm that was challenged by Whybray's "The Making of the Pentateuch".

== Summary ==

''The Making of the Pentateuch'' (in fact only Genesis–Numbers, as Whybray excludes Deuteronomy) is in three parts. Part 1 examines the methodology and assumptions of source criticism and the [[Documentary Hypothesis]]; Part 2 examines the methodology of form criticism and tradition history as developed by Noth and others; and Part 3 sets out Whybray's own suggestions for the process by which the Pentateuch came to be composed.&lt;ref name="j1518470"&gt;J. A. Emerton [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1518470 ''Vetus Testamentum''], Vol. 39, Fasc. 1 (Jan., 1989), pp. 110–116&lt;/ref&gt;

Whybray's attack on the documentary hypothesis addressed the basic methodology of source criticism, which relies on the existence of inconsistencies, repetitions and stylistic features such as alternative names for God to identify distinctive sources within the biblical text. The assumptions behind this methodology, Whybray says, are illogical and self-contradictory. If the authors of the original documents did not tolerate contradiction and repetition, why did the editors of the final work do so? And if the writers who created the final document did not mind such features, why should we suppose that the earlier sources did not contain contradiction and repetition? "Thus the hypothesis can only be maintained on the assumption that, while consistency was the hallmark of the various documents, inconsistency was the hallmark of the redactors" (p.&amp;nbsp;19). Similarly, the repetition and stylistic variation which the documentary hypothesis explains as the remains of distinct sources, may be understood quite differently. For example, since other religious texts use a variety of names for God, why should the change of divine name in Genesis from [[YHWH|Yahweh]] to [[Elohim]] signal a change of source? There could be a theological reason why one name is preferred to another, or the writer may just want a change. Repetition is often done for stylistic reasons, or for emphasis, or for rhetorical effect or in poetic parallelism. The task of form and tradition critics, according to Whybray, is even more difficult than that of source critics. Where the latter are dealing with partially extant texts, the former are dealing with hypothetical reconstructions for which we have no tangible evidence: "Much of Noth's detailed reconstruction of the Pentateuchal traditions was obtained by piling one speculation upon another." (p.&amp;nbsp;20)

His critique of scholars such as [[Rolf Rendtorff]] and [[Erhard Blum]] (a student of Rendtorff), who worked after Noth but in the same form and tradition-critical school was even more trenchant. These scholars contributed to what is known as the [[Supplementary hypothesis]].

According to Whybray:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Rendtorff has merely replaced the comparatively simple Documentary Hypothesis which postulated only a small number of written sources and redactors with a bewildering multiplicity of sources and redactors" (p.&amp;nbsp;21), while Blum's approach was, if anything, more complex and more dogmatic{{snd}} not to mention less demonstrable{{snd}} than Rendtorff's.&lt;ref name="biblicalstudies.org.uk"&gt;Gordon Wenham, [http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html#10 ''Pentateuchal Studies Today''], [[Themelios]] 22.1 (October 1996): 3–13.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Whybray's own, alternative hypothesis, is based not on the documentary model but on a fragmentary model. He suggests that the Pentateuch was the product of a single author (not the four authors and multiple editors of the documentary hypothesis) working at some time in the 6th century BC "[with] a mass of material, most of which may have been of quite recent origin and had not necessarily formed part of any ancient Israelite tradition" (p.&amp;nbsp;242). Whybray saw this author as a national historian, aware of contemporary Greek history and writing in conscious imitation of Greek models, with the aim of extending the existing [[Deuteronomic history]] backwards in time to create a national history of the Israelites from the creation of the world.&lt;ref name="j1518470"/&gt;

== Assessment ==

''The Making of the Pentateuch'' has been described as "the most compelling critique of the hypothesis" ever made, and its arguments are frequently cited by evangelical Christians who wish to state the case for Mosaic authorship (although Whybray explicitly rejects this notion and states that he regards the Pentateuch as fiction).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/bibs/DJACcurrres/Whybray.html "Making Waves Gently: The Contribution of Norman Whybray to British Old Testament Study"], University of Sheffield&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gordon Wenham]], for example, writing in 1996, "Whybray's work on the Pentateuch could be viewed as the logical conclusion of the direction in which most pentateuchal criticism has been moving in the last three decades. ... His book is a powerful and valid critique of the methods that have been taken for granted in Pentateuchal criticism for nearly two centuries."&lt;ref name="biblicalstudies.org.uk"/&gt;

Egyptologist and Bible scholar [[James K. Hoffmeier]] has affirmed that although Whybray offers the most comprehensive critique of the documentary hypothesis within recent critical scholarship, he concludes that Whybray's view doesn't actually advance pentateuchal studies but instead revives a late 18th, early 19th century theory held by Alexander Geddes and J.S. Vater.&lt;ref&gt;James Karl Hoffmeier.
