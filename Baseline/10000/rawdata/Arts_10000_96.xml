An '''acting workshop''' is  a meeting of actors or others of one specific trade to learn how to hone their skills and to [[social network|network]] with other actors, [[acting coach]]es, and casting directors.  Many actors will critique, mentor, and coach their peers and offer tips on how to improve their preparation for roles, [[audition]]s, and enhance their performing abilities. Acting workshops are often staffed by professionals, which can include acting coaches, directors, or actors. Casting directors sometimes also act as coaches. It is usually recommended that serious actors attend acting workshops to help increase their skill.

==Specialist types==
There are other types of workshops for similar kinds of performance trades. Voice actors learn how to enhance their skill of voicing a character, writers learn to how to give characters personality, and comedians can learn how to increase their comedic skill.  
==Examples==
Specialist independent workshops exist to provide the facilities required for training and providing skills courses. A good example of this is [[Dewar Studios]] in Great Titchfield Street in Central London.

==Plot==
Set in 1963, the film revolves around Melody Ellison, an African-American girl living in Detroit, Michigan with her mother Frances and her grandfather Frank. Early on she and her family faced racial inequality in their hometown, whether being bullied at school with a white student named Donald along with his friends for her ethnicity, or be wrongfully accused of [[shoplifting]] at a clothing store where Melody's mother works.

A turning point for Melody was when a fellow student expressed her intention of moving to another school out of fear for being discriminated, and when news about the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing]] was aired on television, making her question the [[Pledge of Allegiance (United States)|Pledge of Allegiance]] and consider moving to a school at her neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Petski"/&gt; Fearing that a similar bombing would happen at the chapel where Melody's family attend mass in, Melody tries to convince her mother not to perform at a fundraising concert for the Birmingham victims; Frances reassures her, and sees hope in her daughter. Melody puts her creative skill at clothing design to good use, upcycling an old garment into a shawl for her mother to wear at her piano performance.

At church she meets her teacher Miss Abbot, who brought the other students along as part of a field trip. Donald walks out as he refuses to take Melody along; Melody's best friend Tricia volunteers to accompany her instead. The concert takes place as planned, and Melody and the rest of the churchgoers then perform ''[[Lift Every Voice and Sing]]''. The film ends with Melody and her mother being given an applause for their performance. A short tribute to the four young victims of the Birmingham bombing appears in a post-credits sequence.

[[File:Berthe Hoola van Nooten53.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;''[[Annona reticulata]]'' - Custard-apple]]
'''Berthe Hoola van Nooten''' (née Bartha Hendrica Philippina van Dolder; 12 October 1817 in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]] – 12 April 1892 in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]]), was a Dutch botanical artist, noted for her botanical plates illustrating ''"Fleurs, Fruits et Feuillages Choisis de l'Ile de Java"'' in 1863-64.

==Life==
Berthe was the daughter of Johannes Wilhelmus van Dolder, a vicar, and his wife Philippina Maria Batenburg. On 11 July 1838 in [[Wageningen]], she married Dirk Hoola van Nooten, a judge in [[Paramaribo]]. Interested in [[botany]], she regularly sent specimens of cultivated plants to botanical gardens in the Netherlands, collected on trips through [[Suriname]] with her husband. She and her husband later moved to New Orleans where they established a female seminary connected to the Protestant Episcopal Church. Personal tragedy struck with her husband's death from yellow fever in 1847, leaving her with a young family of five. She was judged competent by the church and allowed to continue the seminary.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church of Louisiana (1848)&lt;/ref&gt; After a stay in Europe the New Orleans female seminary was re-established in Plaquemine, parish of Iberville, Louisiana, in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Times Picayune, published as The Daily Picayune; Date: 05-07-1850; Page: 8&lt;/ref&gt; She then moved to Galveston. In January 1854 ''The Galveston News'' reported that Mrs. van Nooten's Young Ladies Institute, for which she purchased a 'large and handsome residence,' was operational. In October and November 1855 however the same paper published repeated court orders for B. H. van Nooten, who had argued she was not a resident of Texas, to appear for the Justice of the Peace to answer to creditors. Next we hear of her on the island of Java, to which she travelled with her brother, who was a highly successful merchant in the business of sugar, machines and life insurance. Having arrived in Java she applied for a Government subsidy for setting up a Protestant female seminary to countenance the influence of Roman Catholic seminaries. Probably being refused such support and aware of the vogue in Europe for lavish illustrations of exotic ''flora'', she set about producing 40 plates depicting interesting plant species from Java in which pursuit she followed the precedents set by [[Maria Sibylla Merian]] and [[Elizabeth Blackwell]].

Her attempts to publish the work were unsuccessful until she acquired the patronage of [[Sophie of Württemberg|Sophia Mathilde]], wife of [[King William III of the Netherlands]]. The exceptionally well executed [[chromolithographs]] were done by Pieter De [[Pannemaeker]], the Belgian lithographer operating from [[Ledeberg]] in [[Ghent]]. ''"Van Nooten was clearly a more than competent artist, for the splendid tropical plants, with their lush foliage, vividly coloured flowers and exotic fruit, have been depicted with great skill. She managed to accentuate the splendour of each species by adopting a style that combined great precision and clarity with a touch of neo-Baroque exuberance, reveling in the rich forms and colours of the tropics. The reader's eye is immediately captured by the dark leaves, shown furled or crumpled or partly nibbled away by insects, the delicately rendered details of the follicles and seeds, and the heavy clusters of flowers that cascade down the page. The excellent reproduction of the artist's drawings in the form of chromolithographs lends a tactile quality to these striking images."'' — Lucia Tongiorgi Tomasi, ''An Oak Spring Flora.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomasi|first=Lucia Tongiorgi|title=An Oak Spring Flora: Flower Illustration from the Fifteenth Century to the Present Time: A Selection of the Rare Books, Manuscripts, and Works of Art in the Collection of Rachel Lambert Mellon|location=Upperville, Va.; New Haven, Conn.|publisher=Oak Spring Garden Library; distributed by [[Yale University Press]]|year=1997|isbn=0-300-07139-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the book was published in a number of editions, Hoola van Nooten died in poverty in [[Batavia, Dutch East Indies|Batavia]] at the age of 74. The Hoola van Nooten family name is today respected in the Netherlands, and is listed in the [[:nl:Nederlands Patriciaat|Nederlands Patriciaat]], a register of Dutch families who have played a significant role in Dutch society over the past 150 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/issues/98/story09.html|title=National Library Acquires Rare Botanical Work by Dutch Female Artist - GATEWAYS - National Library of Australia|website=www.nla.gov.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bhowani Junction''''' is a 1956 [[film adaptation]] of the 1954 novel ''[[Bhowani Junction]]'' by [[John Masters]] made by [[MGM]]. The film was directed by [[George Cukor]] and produced by [[Pandro S. Berman]] from a screenplay by [[Sonya Levien]] and [[Ivan Moffat]].

The film starred [[Ava Gardner]] as Victoria Jones, an [[Anglo-Indian]] who has been serving in the [[Indian Army]], and [[Stewart Granger]] as Colonel Rodney Savage, a (British) Indian Army officer.  It also featured [[Bill Travers]], [[Abraham Sofaer]], [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]], [[Lionel Jeffries]] and (uncredited)&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0049007|title=Bhowani Junction}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neelo]] (who went on to become one of the leading ladies of the Pakistan film industry).

The film was shot in England at [[MGM-British Studios]], [[Borehamwood]], [[Hertfordshire]], on the [[Longmoor Military Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ronald, D. W.|author2=Carter, R. J.|title=The Longmoor Military Railway|publisher=David &amp; Charles|location=Newton Abbot|year=1974|isbn=0-7153-6357-3|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on location in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].

==Plot==
India, 1947: In the final days of British rule, Victoria Jones, the daughter of an Indian mother and an English [[railroad engineer|train engineer]], is serving in the British Army. She returns on leave after four years to her home in Bhowani, where supporters of [[Mahatma Gandhi]] are non-violently protesting against British rule and communists, led by a revolutionary known as Davay, foment riot and sabotage.

She becomes reacquainted with a childhood sweetheart also of [[Anglo-Indian]] heritage, rail traffic superintendent Patrick Taylor, and with Colonel Rodney Savage, whose Indian battalion has been sent to Bhowani to maintain law and order as British rule ends. The protesters disrupt rail service and Savage places Victoria on duty during the crisis. He disperses the protesters but Victoria does not approve of his methods. She begins seriously contemplating her identity and speculates that she might marry a man from India, although clearly Taylor is still in love with her and Savage infatuated.

Walking home alone one night, Victoria is attacked and nearly raped by Captain McDaniel, one of Savage's officers, killing him with a steel bar. Finding her, a [[Sikh]] co-worker of Taylor's, Ranjit Kasel, takes her to his home and offers her sanctuary, introducing her to his mother, the Sardarni, and to a guest in their home, Ghan Shyam, who offers to hide McDaniel's body after the Sardarni worries that her son Ranjit will be accused of murdering the officer.

Davay's raids continue. He blows up a train, causing numerous deaths and injuries. Victoria, influenced by her love for India, decides to marry Ranjit, but during the ceremony fearing the complete loss of her identity, suddenly flees. When an army sentry is found murdered because he saw McDaniel and Victoria together just before she killed the officer, Victoria realizes that the man in Ranjit's home, Ghan Shyam, is actually Davay and that the Sardarni, once a notorious Indian resistance leader, has been harboring him.

Davay kidnaps Victoria, using her to escape the city aboard her father's train. Savage and Taylor intercept the train before it reaches a tunnel, rescuing Victoria but finding Davay has gone into the tunnel with dynamite. Taylor recklessly advances to defuse the dynamite but is shot by Davay, who is immediately killed by Savage. Savage, cradling Taylor as he dies, watches the passage of the train. On board is Gandhi, whom Davay meant to assassinate, thereby inciting further hostilities and riots.

Savage's duty in India ends and he is summoned back to England, but his love for Victoria has become overwhelming. When she refuses to marry him and live in England, he proposes to marry but remain in India, and she accepts. Savage's superior offers to expedite his early release from military service as reward for his accomplishments.

==Differences from novel==
The film, like the original novel, portrays the Anglo-Indian protagonist, Victoria Jones, as tugged in different directions by three suitors, Col. Rodney Savage, Ranjit Kasel and Patrick Taylor, each representing a different ethnic community: British, Indian (Sikh) and Anglo-Indian, respectively.  The film-makers, however, changed the novel's ending and Victoria's fate.  Whereas in the novel Victoria finally seeks her future with her fellow Anglo-Indian Patrick, a railway worker, the film-makers instead matched her at the end with the more obviously dashing British officer Rodney Savage, while consigning Patrick to a heroic death.&lt;ref name=Jacobson&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Andrew|title=Bhowani Junction –a brief but memorable encounter with Hollywood|url=http://area148.com/cms/bhowani-junction-a-brief-but-memorable-encounter-with-hollywood/|accessdate=7 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006151540/http://area148.com/cms/bhowani-junction-a-brief-but-memorable-encounter-with-hollywood/|archivedate=6 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(In the writer's own depiction, in the (unfilmed) sequel "[[To the Coral Strand]]", Rodney Savage does stay on in India after the end of British rule - but he does not marry Victoria, but rather goes through many upheavals and finally finds love with an Indian woman.)

==Production==
The novel was the fourth by John Masters about India.&lt;ref&gt;By, L. N. (1954, Mar 28). Talk with john masters. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113010573&lt;/ref&gt; MGM outbid two other studios to buy the film rights, paying more than $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;By THOMAS M PRYOR Special to The New York Times. (1954, Apr 12). METRO BIDS HIGH FOR INDIA NOVEL. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113115288&lt;/ref&gt; Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger were announced as leads almost immediately; Gardner had been on suspension at the studio for refusing to appear in ''[[Love Me or Leave Me (film)|Love Me or Leave Me]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Special to The New York Times. (1954, Aug 14). AVA GARDNER SET FOR FILM ON INDIA. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/112983416&lt;/ref&gt;

George Cukor was assigned to direct. He travelled to India in October 1954 to research the movie. "I feel that for the first time India has been presented in this book as it really is, instead of the usual hokey-pokey atmosphere in which it is painted by most authors who write about it," he said.&lt;ref&gt;GeorgeCukor HereToGet the feel of india. (1954, Oct 03). The Times of India (1861-Current) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/608296868&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian government refused to cooperate with the production of the film.&lt;ref&gt;By A.H. WEILER. (1954, Oct 24). BY WAY OF REPORT. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113049044&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional  location Bhowani [[Junction (rail)|Junction]] was in [[India]], most probably [[Jhansi]].  MGM had wanted to shoot the film in location in India; but, as the government of India insisted on script approval and imposed high taxes,  MGM  decided to film in [[Pakistan]] where the government was more welcoming.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;By, J. P. (1955, May 15). First 'invasion' of pakistan by film troupe met with welcome reception. New York Times (1923-Current File) Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/113436640&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the change in location to Pakistan, the script was altered to show Rodney Savage in command of the 1/13 Frontier Force Battalion ([[55th Coke's Rifles (Frontier Force)|Coke's Rifles]]), which at that time of filming was part of the 7th (Golden Arrow) Division of the [[Pakistan Army]], rather than in command of a [[Gurkha]] Battalion, the  1/13 Gorkha Rifles, as in the book.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt; Pakistan army and police enthusiastically assisted in making of the film.  Several Pakistan army units of the 7 Golden Arrow Division including the 5th Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 10 Frontier Force Regiment), 5th Probyn’s Horse, 1st Battalion of 13th Frontier Force Rifles (now 7 Frontier Force Regiment), participated in the making of the film. Colonel Savage in the film is shown wearing the Golden Arrow formation sign of the Pakistan 7 Division.&lt;ref name="Jacobson"/&gt;

Also in the movie is the 4th Battalion (Wilde's) 13th Frontier Force Rifles, the band at the Lahore Railway Station with a deer as its mascot, while the troops taking part in the train accident were from the 4/13th. The battalion has a copy of the book and autographed photographs from both Ava Gardner and Stewart Granger.

The future Pakistani film star [[Neelo]] appeared in a small role as a reporter in a crowd scene. Neelo was introduced to Cukor by A. H. Rana, the film's production manager and casting assistant in Pakistan, who worked with the film's casting director, Harvey Woods. This was her first role in a movie.

==Reception==
The film earned $2,075,000 in North America and $2.8 million elsewhere, making a profit of $1,238,000.&lt;ref name="Mannix"/&gt;

It recorded admissions of 1,554,970 in France.&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-ava-gardner-c24969968|title=Ava Gardner Box Office|last=Soyer|first=Renaud|first2=Didier|last2=Noisy|date=28 March 2014|work=Box Office Story|language=French|accessdate=7 June 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140919020036/http://www.boxofficestory.com/box-office-ava-gardner-c24969968|archivedate=19 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''brush pot''' ({{zh|c=笔筒|p=bǐtǒng}}) is a container for holding the brushes used by scribes for [[Chinese calligraphy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=149 |chapter=Brush pots |title=Chinese Ivories: From the Shang to the Qing |author=Oriental Ceramic Society |publisher=British Museum |year=1984 |isbn=9780903421225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These are typically carved from bamboo or jade with ornate motifs symbolising concepts such as [[longevity]].  Antique examples are now valued highly.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/2svW9tmQHWL8jCMLPDvKyX9/18th-century-chinese-brush-pot|title=BBC One – Antiques Roadshow – 18th Century Chinese brush pot|work=BBC|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The brushes would be rinsed and stored in the pot with their handle down so that the bundles of hair would keep their shape and point.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=History of Design: Decorative Arts and Material Culture |page=313 |isbn=0300196148 |author=Pat Kirkham, Susan Weber |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
=== In China ===
Bamboo curved brush pots were likely to be first produced in China, given that the use of bamboo to create articles originated there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=杭间, 郭秋惠|title=中国传统工艺 Cultural China series|date=2006|publisher=中信出版社|isbn=9787508509631|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=9PxZ5JWoTRsC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=china+first+brush+pot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In Korea ===
After [[Neo-Confucianism]] was welcomed as the formal doctrine in Korea at the beginning of the [[Joseon]] era, the new intellectually aware and literate ''[[yangban]]'' replaced aristocrats and Buddhist monks. These yangban consisted of civil servants and military officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/yangban|title=yangban – Korean society|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new elite ruling class spent a significant part of their time in writing calligraphy alongside reading. To satisfy this new demand, production of brush pots started in Korea.&lt;ref name="PO"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/asia/p/porcelain_brush_pot.aspx|title=British Museum – Porcelain brush pot|publisher=[[British Museum]]|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
Made in wood, stone, porcelain and bamboo, brush pots were mostly cylindrical and were often decorated with traditional symbols inscribed on their body. During the Joseon era the royal family exclusively used the [[dragon]] motif for their brush pots. Later on the dragon decoration became a common theme.&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt; In China, [[Ivory]] for its plain but [[jade]]-like texture is considered an excellent material for brush pots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/25Arts14877.html|title=Ivory Brush Pot with Dragons|work=cultural-china.com|accessdate=11 November 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907210553/http://arts.cultural-china.com/en/25Arts14877.html|archivedate=7 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ivory is used in Chinese brush pots because of its resemblance to bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stephen Davies|title=Philosophical Perspectives on Art|date=2010|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=Oxford|isbn=9780199202430|page=95|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=EToiAr9GvbAC&amp;pg=PA95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Value ==
High quality period Chinese brush pots can fetch high prices. In 2012, a Chinese brush pot made of bamboo was donated to a [[Bristol]]-based charity shop. When the shop sold the brush pot to raise funds for St Peter's Hospice, it was sold for £360,000 even though the rim had been mended with glue and the bamboo frame had a substantial crack.&lt;ref name = "telegraph"/&gt; Examination of the brush pot discovered that it was made between 1662 and 1722 by [[Gu Jue]], a well known old master of the time.&lt;ref name = "telegraph"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/9293365/Chinese-art-collectors-scramble-to-buy-battered-pot-from-Bristol-charity-shop.html|title=Chinese art collectors scramble to buy battered pot from Bristol charity shop|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=27 May 2012| accessdate=25 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Skinner Asian Arts Auction, an 18th-century {{convert|6|in|adj=on}} bamboo Chinese brush pot was sold for $539,500. The pot was inscribed with detailed figures of immortals and animals set in mountainous landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antiquesandthearts.com/brush-pot-is-hot-at-539500-at-skinner-asian-arts-auction/|title=Brush Pot Is Hot At 539,500 At Skinner Asian Arts Auction|work=antiquesandthearts.com|accessdate=11 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
Brush pots were used by Chinese and Korean scholars between the 18th and 19th century. Calligraphy brushes were generally kept in the brush pots but intermittently, they were also used to stock paper rolls (rolled-up papers) hence they are sometime also called paper holders.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PO"/&gt;

Measuring more than two metres tall and more than five metres wide, the canvas was painted by Leighton from 1853 to 1855 in Rome as his first major work.&lt;ref name=NG&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/frederic-lord-leighton-cimabues-celebrated-madonna | title=Cimabue's Celebrated Madonna | publisher=nationalgallery.org.uk | date= | accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1988 it has been displayed in the [[National Gallery, London]], on long-term loan from the [[Royal Collection]], where it has been previously hung prominently, high above the main vestibule, directly beyond the entrance to the gallery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Virtual Tour|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/visiting/virtualtour/#/stairs/?ath=-1.4214213562537779&amp;atv=-9.510941552685685&amp;fov=82.94949308652133|publisher=nationalgallery.org.uk|accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leighton House]] has an [[oil sketch]] for the painting, and several preparatory drawings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/arts/yourpaintings/paintings/colour-sketch-for-cimabues-celebrated-madonna-is-carried-180258 Public Catalogue Foundation/BBC "Your Paintings" website]; [http://www.artfund.org/what-we-do/art-weve-helped-buy/artwork/11844/cimabues-celebrated-madonna-is-carried-in-processsion-through-the-streets-of-florence-lord-frederic-leighton webpage], [[The Art Fund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The picture shows a scene from the 16th century [[art historian]] [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s description of the 13th century procession of an [[altarpiece]] of the [[Madonna and Child]] through the streets of [[Florence, Italy|Florence]].&lt;ref name=NG/&gt; The Madonna is being carried from the studio of the [[Florentine School|Florentine artist]] [[Cimabue]] to the church of [[Santa Maria Novella]]. Cimabue himself is depicted immediately in front of the Madonna wearing a [[laurel wreath]] upon his head. He is followed by a group including several leading Florentine artistic figures of the day, including his pupil [[Giotto]], the poet [[Dante Alighieri]] (leaning on the wall at right), the architect [[Arnolfo di Cambio]],{{efn|"Arnolfo di Lapo" was the name given by Vasari for Arnolfo di Cambio, and was named as "di Lapo" in the original exhibition catalog.}} the painters [[Gaddo Gaddi]], [[Andrea Tafi (artist)|Andrea Tafi]], [[Buonamico Buffalmacco]] and [[Simone Memmi]]; the sculptor [[Nicola Pisano]],{{sfn|Monkhouse|1899|p=94}} and on horseback at the right edge of the image, the [[King of Naples]], [[Charles of Anjou]].&lt;ref name=NG/&gt;

The Madonna depicted, seen at a very narrow angle in the centre of the painting, is actually not by Cimabue, but instead it is the ''[[Rucellai Madonna]]'' by [[Sienese School|Sienese artist]] [[Duccio di Buoninsegna]]. This error is the result of the misattribution of this altarpiece by Vasari which lasted into Leighton's time, an error which was not corrected until 1889 by [[Franz Wickhoff]].{{sfn|Clark|2009|p=81}} Both the ''Rucellai Madonna'' and a similar work that is correctly attributed to Cimabue, the ''[[Santa Trinita Maestà]]'', are displayed at the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in Florence.

==Reception==
The painting was an immediate success for Leighton when he presented it at the 1855 summer exhibition of the [[Royal Academy of Arts]] in London where it received near-universal acclaim.{{sfn|Barker|1999|p=181}} [[Queen Victoria]] purchased it on the first day of the exhibition for 600 guineas. The National Gallery notes Victoria's diary entry about the painting: "There was a very big picture by a man called Leighton. It is a beautiful painting, quite reminding one of a [[Paul Veronese]], so bright and full of light. [[Albert, Prince Consort|Albert]] was enchanted with it—so much so that he made me buy it."&lt;ref name=NG/&gt; The English artist [[Dante Gabriel Rossetti]] wrote that the work proved Leighton's "great power of rich arrangement."{{sfn|Barrington|1906|p=191}} His brother, the art critic and writer [[William Rossetti]], was not as enchanted: "His picture has largeness, but not greatness; style, but not intensity; design rather than thought; arrangement rather than conception: it is individual, not specially original."{{sfn|Rossetti|1867|p=254}}

'''Coptic art''' is a term used either for the art of Egypt produced in the early Christian era or for the art produced by the [[Copts|Coptic Christians]] themselves.  Coptic art is best-known for its wall-paintings, textiles, [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and metalwork, much of which survives in monasteries and churches. The artwork is often functional, as little distinction was drawn between artistry and craftsmanship, and includes tunics and tombstones as well as portraits of saints.
The [[Coptic Museum]] in [[Coptic Cairo]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20040603205525/http://www.copticmuseum.gov.eg/English/internal/brief_history.asp Coptic museum]. copticmuseum.gov.eg&lt;/ref&gt; houses some of the world's most important examples of Coptic art.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214033413/http://www.lastminute.com/site/find/World/Middle-East/Egypt/Cairo/WOW-Attraction-106088.html Coptic Museum]. lastminute.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Coptic art displays a mix of native Egyptian and Hellenistic influences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eternalegypt.org/EternalEgyptWebsiteWeb/HomeServlet?ee_website_action_key=action.display.module&amp;story_id=&amp;module_id=305&amp;language_id=1&amp;text=textGreek Influence on Coptic Art]. eternalegypt.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subjects and symbols were taken from both Greek and Egyptian mythology, sometimes altered to fit Christian beliefs.  Persia and Syria also influenced Coptic art, though to a lesser extent, leaving images such as the peacock and the griffin.

==Icon painting==
Coptic [[icon]]s have their origin in the Hellenistic art of Egyptian Late Antiquity, as exemplified by the [[Fayum mummy portraits]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeessays.cc/db/6/ame86.shtml Greek And Roman Art].

Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt; The faces of El Fayum are examples of the Coptic art in the 2nd century AD showing the Greek and Roman influence on the Coptic art but with some distinctive features related to Egyptian art.

The Arabic conquest of Egypt allowed the Coptic art to influence the Islamic art and architecture with many features that are now integral in the Islamic art.

Beginning in the 4th century, churches painted their walls and made icons to reflect an authentic expression of their faith.

The figures of saints display eyes and ears larger in proportion to the rest of the face and a smaller mouth, as well as enlarged heads, signifying a spiritual relationship with God and devotion to prayer. Martyrs' faces were peaceful.

Many Coptic icon painters did not sign their names, but the prominent among them include St. [[Luke the Evangelist|Luke]] (traditionally believed to be the first icon painter) and two [[Coptic Pope]]s, [[Pope Macarius I of Alexandria|Pope Macarius I]] and [[Pope Gabriel III of Alexandria|Pope Gabriel III]]&lt;ref&gt;Wahba, Zakaria (January 1993) [http://www.coptic.net/articles/CopticIcons.txt ICONS – 'Their history and Spiritual Significance']. Coptic.net. Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting mid-18th century icon painting enjoyed a revival in Egypt and once again was popular. One of the most famous artists was [[Yuhanna al-Armani]] whose works were noted for using more developed techniques and novel construction (e.g. using a set of icons to tell a single story).&lt;ref&gt;Magdi Guirguis, ''An Armenian Artist in Ottoman Cairo: Yuhanna al-Armani and His Coptic Icons'' (Cairo,: The American University in Cairo Press, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
The influence of Coptic art and architecture on [[Islamic architecture]] and incorporation of some Coptic features in Islamic building started as early as the 7th century AD &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiscali.co.uk/reference/encyclopaedia/hutchinson/m0018814.html Islamic art]. Tiscali. Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[Church of Alexandria]] was the first Church of Africa the influence of Coptic art spread to Sudan and Ethiopia. Some forms of the [[Coptic cross]] are known as the [[Ethiopian cross]] and many Churches in Ethiopia show the influence of the Coptic art.

[[Menas flask]]s are very cheap [[terracotta]] bottles bought by pilgrims to [[Abu Mina]], the shrine of [[Saint Menas]], in the 4th and 5th centuries.  The clay was impressed before firing with blocks with images of the saint. They have been found nearly all over the Christian world, and many scholars trace influence from their fairly crude images in the emerging [[iconography]] of Western [[medieval art]], among other Coptic influences.

== Textiles ==
A remarkable number of Coptic [[textile]]s survive today, due to the Coptic custom of burying them with the dead, and to the aridity of Egyptian graves.  The textiles are commonly linen or wool and use the colors red, blue, yellow, green, purple, black and brown.  The dyes were derived from madder, indigo, woad, saffron, the murex shell, and the kermes insect.  The first looms used were horizontal low-warp; vertical high-warp looms were introduced later.  The basic garment was the [[tunic]], which would become the dalmatic.  Some tunics were woven in one piece.  They were decorated by clavi, a stylistic import from Rome.

Some fine examples of the Coptic textile are shown in museums all over the world and a large collection is in the [[Coptic Museum]] in [[Coptic Cairo]] &lt;ref&gt;Bernier, Oliver (1989-01-01) [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=950DE5D61239F932A35752C0A96F948260 Coptic Artistry And Tradition In Old Cairo]. New York Times. Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;
Tens of thousands of coloured fragments found their way into the museums of the world, especially after 1889 when the French archaeologist [[Albert Gayet]] published a catalogue of Coptic art and, in the [[Bulaq Museum]], staged the first exhibition of Coptic monuments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/796/hr1.htm A tapestry of Coptic history]. ''Alahram Weekley''. Weekly.ahram.org.eg, Issue No. 796 (2006-05-31). Retrieved on 2013-08-23.&lt;/ref&gt;  The early Coptic textiles still produced pictures and decoration incorporating Egyptian and Greek motifs.  Shrouds, for example, might incorporate classical elements were painted in the form of an Egyptian sarcophagus and include representations of Egyptian gods to protect the dead.  Later coptic textiles showed the influence of Byzantium and later, Islamic art.

== Modern Coptic art ==
{{cn span|Modern Coptic art is also known as the Neo-Coptic school. In recent centuries icons have been the main means of expression, keeping most traditional aspects.  Coptic icons are more concerned religious truth and beauty than with realism, the depiction of depth, or perspective.  As in the Byzantine and related traditions, the figures are depicted frontally, looking straight at the viewer. Today, Coptic icons are found not only in churches, but also in homes and praying altars.  They may also be purchased from Coptic gift shops throughout [[Egypt]] and the Coptic diaspora.|date=August 2017}}

{{cn span|During the papacy of [[Pope Cyril VI]], the emergence of Coptic painters like [[Isaac Fanous|Isaac Fanous Youssef]], along with the revival of Coptic art, brought about the creation of the Contemporary or Neo-Coptic school of iconography.|date=August 2017}}

{{cn span|In 1952, architect and coptic Christian [[Ramses Wissa Wassef]] founded the [[Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Center]] in Giza, Egypt.  He asked 14 children, mostly copts, to develop a new artform by reviving the ancient coptic weaving method.  The coptic weaver [[Maryam Hermina]] (born 1932) taught the children the technique.  The Art Centre has a significant museum of the 20th century tapestries.|date=August 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6312">'''Demaratus''' ({{lang-el|Δημάρατος}}), frequently called '''Demaratus of Corinth''', was the father of [[Lucius Tarquinius Priscus]], the fifth [[King of Rome]], and the grandfather or great-grandfather of [[Lucius Tarquinius Superbus]], the seventh and last Roman king.

==Life==
Demaratus was a nobleman of the [[Dorians|Dorian]] House of the [[Bacchiadae]] at [[Ancient Corinth|Corinth]].  Facing charges of sedition, in 655 BC he fled to [[Italy]], according to tradition settling in the [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] city of [[Tarquinii]], where he married an Etruscan noblewoman.  They had two sons, Lucius and [[Arruns Tarquinius (son of Demaratus)|Arruns]].

According to tradition, Demaratus introduced [[Greek culture]] to mainland Italy, and brought potters from Corinth; Greek potters worked at Tarquinii and its port, [[Gravisca]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}  [[Tacitus]] reported that Demaratus brought literacy to the Etruscans.  According to [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], Demaratus' son or grandson was the first foreigner to visit [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]], and make a dedication there.

==Descendants==
Through his sons, Demaratus was the ancestor of the Roman [[Tarquinia (gens)|gens Tarquinia]], and a forebear of several other notable Roman families.  By blood or marriage, his descendants included the last three kings of Rome, as well as the first two [[Roman consul]]s.

Demaratus had two sons, Lucius and Arruns Tarquinius.  Arruns died shortly before his father, who accordingly bequeathed all of his wealth to his remaining son, Lucius, unaware that Arruns' wife was pregnant with Demaratus' grandson.  Thus, in spite of his grandfather's wealth, the child, who was named [[Arruns Tarquinius (Egerius)|Arruns]] after his father, was born into poverty.  For this reason, he came to be called ''Egerius'', meaning "the needy one."

Like his father, Lucius Tarquinius married an Etruscan noblewoman, but as the son of a foreigner he was unable to attain high station at Tarquinii.  At the urging of his wife, [[Tanaquil]], Tarquin migrated to Rome, where even a foreigner might hope to gain rank and influence.  There he won the favour of the king, [[Ancus Marcius]], and when the king died, Tarquin was chosen to succeed him.  After subduing the [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latin]] town of [[Collatia]], the king placed his nephew, Arruns, in charge of the Roman garrison there.

Tarquin's daughter married [[Servius Tullius]], who succeeded him as the sixth king of Rome.  After a long and prosperous reign, Tullius was deposed by his own son-in-law, Lucius Tarquinius Superbus, the son or grandson of the elder Tarquin.  An Etruscan legend told of how Servius, aided by the heroes Aulus and [[Caelius Vibenna]], had defeated and killed a group of enemies, including a certain Gnaeus Tarquinius of Rome, perhaps the son of Tarquin the Elder and father of Tarquin the Proud.

Many of the leading figures on both sides in the establishment of the Roman Republic were descendants of Demaratus.  In addition to the king, the king's wife was a descendant of Demaratus as her mother was the daughter of the elder Tarquin; and their three sons played prominent roles in the unfolding of events.  It was the rape of [[Lucretia]] by [[Sextus Tarquinius]] that inspired the Roman nobles to rebel against the king; [[Arruns Tarquinius (son of Tarquin the Proud)|Arruns Tarquinius]] and the Roman consul [[Lucius Junius Brutus]] slew one another in the first great battle of the Roman Republic; and [[Titus Tarquinius]] narrowly avoided death at the [[Battle of Lake Regillus]].  The Latin army that marched against the Romans on that occasion was commanded by [[Octavius Mamilius]], the dictator of [[Tusculum]], and a son-in-law of Tarquin's.

Meanwhile, the first two consuls were each descendants of Demaratus; Brutus' mother was the king's sister, while his colleague was [[Lucius Tarquinius Collatinus]], the son of Egerius, and husband of Lucretia.  Before his death at the hands of Titus Tarquinius, Brutus compelled his colleague to resign and go into exile, arguing that none of the Tarquinian gens should hold power at Rome.

Three important Roman gentes claimed descent from Demaratus; the [[Junia (gens)|Junii]], through the first consul; the [[Mamilia (gens)|Mamilii]], who came to Rome from Tusculum in the fifth century BC; and the [[Tullia (gens)|Tullii]], through Servius Tullius.

[[File:Cross of the Scriptures detail - Crawford plate 146.png|thumb|Scene from the east face of the Cross of the Scriptures, [[Clonmacnoise]]. The figures probably represent Saint [[Ciarán of Clonmacnoise|Ciarán]] and Diarmait mac Cerbaill founding Clonmacnoise: "Then Ciarán planted the first stake, and Diarmait son of Cerball was along with him. Said Ciarán to Diarmait when setting the stake, 'Let, O warrior, thy hand be over my hand, and thou shalt be in sovranty over the men of Ireland.'"&lt;ref&gt;Stokes, ''Book of Lismore'', p. 276. Needs ref for identification.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Diarmait mac Cerbaill''' (died ''[[circa|c]]''. 565) was [[King of Tara]] or [[High King of Ireland]]. According to traditions, he was the last High King to follow the [[paganism|pagan]] rituals of inauguration, the ''ban-feis'' or marriage to goddess of the land.

While many later stories were attached to Diarmait, he was a historical ruler and his descendants were of great significance in Medieval Ireland.  He is not to be confused with the later [[Diarmait mac Cerbaill (King of Osraige)]], son of king [[Cerball mac Dúnlainge]].

==Sources==
It is believed that the earliest of the [[Irish annals]] which came to make up the lost ''[[Chronicle of Ireland]]'' were kept as a contemporary record from no later than the middle of the 7th century, and may be rather older as it has been argued that many late 6th century entries have the appearance of contemporary recording. There is general agreement that the annals are largely based, in their earliest contemporary records, on a chronicle kept at the monastery on [[Iona]], and that the recording moved to somewhere in the midlands of Ireland only around 740. Although it is thus possible that the records of Diarmait's times in the annals are nearly contemporary, the later history of the annals is complex and much debated, so that it is uncertain to what extent surviving late annals such as the ''[[Annals of Ulster]]'' and ''[[Annals of Tigernach]]'' faithfully reproduce the earlier records.

Diarmait mac Cerbaill was the last to hold the sacral kingship of Tara.  He has also some title to be ranked as the first Christian high-king of Ireland.  Two of his sons bore the specifically Christian name of Colmán, deriving from the Latin [[Columbanus]].  This ambivalent character, together with the fact that he was the direct ancestor of the two most powerful dynasties of the [[Southern Uí Néill]], made him an obvious figure for saga and legend.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descendants of Niall==
Diarmait was the son of Fergus Cerrbél, son of [[Conall Cremthainne]], son of [[Niall of the Nine Hostages]]. Yet of Niall's own historicity there is little reason to doubt.  His descendants quarrrelled incessantly among themselves after the manner of most Irish dynastic families and had no cause to invent a common ancestry, since by unanimous testimony the high-kingship of Tara prior to Niall's days had not been the preserve of any one tribe or family.  By the end of the fifth century, however, it was well on the way to becoming so.  Niall's sons and grandsons proclaimed their intention of monopolising it to the exclusion of their western cousins by discarding the tribal appellation of Connachta and adopting the dynastic name [[Uí Néill]], ''nepotes Néill''.  As a great-grandson of Niall, Diarmait and his descendants were counted among the Uí Néill, the name meaning "descendants of Niall".&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two great Southern Uí Néill dynasties of the midlands were the Síl nÁedo Sláine (the Seed of Áedo of Slane), kings of Brega in the east, and the [[Clann Cholmáin|Clann Cholmáin Máir]] (the Children of Colmán the Great) in Mide with their centre in the heart of modern Westmeath.  The former are more prominent in the seventh century, but after the death of Cináed mac Írgalaig in 728 all the high-kings of the Southern Uí Néill come from the Clann Cholmáin except for a brief period between 944 and 956 when the king of Knowth, Congalach Cnogba, restored the high-kingship to the Brega line.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is remarkable that the Síl nÁedo Sláine and Clann Cholmáin derive their origin, not directly from Niall Noígiallach, but from his great-grandson Diarmait mac Cerbaill.  The annals date Diarmait's reign as high-king from about 544 to 565.  The petty Uí Néill kings of Cenél nArdgail traced their ancestry to an uncle of Diarmait's, but never won the high kingship.  Besides Colmáin Már and Áed Sláine, Diarmait had a third son Colmáin Bec, whose descendants, the dynasty of Caílle Follamain, ruled an area corresponding to the baronies of Fore, between Mide and Brega.&lt;ref name=Byrne_90&gt;Byrne, ''Irish Kings'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarmait's immediate origins are obscure and may arouse some suspicion.  In spite of his patronymic (latinised by Adomnán as ''filius Cerbulis'') the genealogical tradition says that his father's name was Fergus, nicknamed ''Cerrbél'' or 'crooked mouth'.  His grandfather Conall son of Niall was nicknamed Cremthainne (possibly denoting fosterage among the Uí Chremthainn of Airgialla), to distinguish him from his brother Conall Gulban, ancestor of the Cenél Conaill.  The habit of giving the same name to different sons remained common among the prolific Irish princes until the sixteenth century.&lt;ref name=Byrne_90/&gt;

==Reign==
The [[Annals of Tigernach]] record that Diarmait celebrated the Feast of Tara, his inauguration as King, in 558 or 560. The previous King of Tara, according to the earliest lists, was Óengarb, an [[epithet]] meaning "extremely rough", presumed to refer to Diarmait's kinsman [[Tuathal Maelgarb]]. What followed the inauguration was "a surprisingly unpropitious reign for so famous a king".&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diarmait was defeated at the [[Battle of Cúl Dreimhne|battle of Cúl Dreimne]] (near [[Ben Bulben]] in modern [[County Sligo]]) in 560 or 561. This was the "Battle of the Books", supposedly the result of Diarmait's judgement in a dispute between Columba and [[Finnian of Moville]]. Columba, it is said, had secretly copied a [[Cathach of St. Columba|book]] belonging to Finnian, and the matter of ownership of the copy had come to be settled by Diarmait, who adjudged in Finnian's favour, reportedly saying "[t]o every cow its calf and to every book its copy." Columba sought support from his kinsmen among the [[Cenél Conaill]] and the [[Cenél nEógain]] of the northern Uí Néill who went to war with Diarmait. This is a late tradition, and annalistic accounts claim that the battle was fought over Diarmait's killing of Diarmait of Curnán, son of [[Áed mac Echach]] (d.575), the [[King of Connacht]] who was under Columba's protection.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 95. A recent work on the battle is Brian Lacey, "The battle of Cúl Dreimne – a reassessment" in the ''Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland'', volume 133 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this defeat, Diarmait lost the battle of Cúil Uinsen to Áed mac Brénainn, king of Tethbae in [[Leinster]]. Diarmait played no part in the great Uí Néill victory over the [[Cruthin]] at Móin Daire Lothair in 563. He was killed in 565, probably at Ráith Bec in Mag Line (Moylinny, near [[Larne]]) in [[Ulster]] by [[Áed Dub mac Suibni]], king of the Cruthin.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the later Irish historians, Diarmait was followed as King of Tara by Domnall Ilchegalch and Forguss, sons of Muirchertach mac Ercae, of the Cenél nEógain. More contemporary sources suggest that the Kingship of Tara all but disappeared in the years following Diarmait's death, and that it was not until the time of [[Domnall mac Áedo]], or perhaps of [[Fiachnae mac Báetáin]], that there was a High King of Ireland again.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 104&amp;ndash;105 &amp; 276&amp;ndash;277.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saints and Druids==
[[Adomnán of Iona]], writing less than 150 years after Diarmait's death, describes him as "ordained by God's will as king of all Ireland." Given that the annals say that Diarmait celebrated the Feast of Tara, the pagan inauguration ceremony, Adomnán's words represent his view of kingship rather than the reality of Diarmait's life.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnán, I, 36 and editor's note 157; Byrne, p. 97.&lt;/ref&gt; Most traditions portray Diarmait as in conflict with saints and holy men, notably Columba. A later poet has Diarmait say "Woe to him that contends with the clergy of the churches".&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 95&amp;ndash;96. The poem is in the [[Book of Leinster]] and is available [http://www.ucc.ie/celt/published/G800011C/text025.html here] at CELT. No translation is presently available.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[{Swim Two Birds]]--&gt;

A poem, ''Mairg thochras fri cléirchib cell'' ("Woe to him who contends with the clergy of the churches") in the Book of Leinster, is ascribed to Diarmait.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prophetic Death of Diarmait==
Supernatural features in Diarmait's reign are not limited to prose and verse works or to lives of saints. Even the [[Irish annals]] include a reference to [[druid]] fences being created at the battle of Cúl Dreimne. The main subject for later writers and poets however, was not Diarmait's life but his death.

Diarmait is told by [[Bec mac Dé]] that [[Áed Dub mac Suibni|Áed Dub]] , Diarmait's foster-son, will be his killer. Accordingly, Diarmait banishes Áed Dub.&lt;ref&gt;Adomnán, I, 36, places Áed's exile after the killing of Diarmait.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saint Ruadán]] gives the prophecy that Diarmait will be killed by the roof-beam of his hall at Tara. Diarmait has the beam cast into the sea. Diarmait then asks his druids to find the manner of his death, and they foretell that he will die a [[threefold death]], by slaughter, drowning and burning, and that the signs of his death will be a shirt grown from a single seed of flax, a mantle made of wool from a single sheep, ale brewed from one seed of corn, and bacon from a sow which has never farrowed.  On a circuit of Ireland, Diarmait comes to the hall of Banbán at Ráith Bec, and there the fate of which he was warned comes to pass. The roof beam of Tara has been recovered from the sea by Banbán and set in his hall, the shirt and mantle and ale and bacon are duly produced for Diarmait. Diarmait goes to leave Banbán's hall, but Áed Dub, waiting at the door, strikes him down and sets fire to the hall. Diarmait crawls into an ale vat to escape the flames and is duly killed by the falling roof beam. Thus, all the prophecies are fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 97&amp;ndash;99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like tales are told of Muirchertach mac Ercae and Adomnán records that Columba prophesied a similar death, by wounding, falling and drowning, for Áed Dub.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, pp. 99&amp;ndash;100; Adomnán, I, 36; Ó Cróinín, pp. 64&amp;ndash;65.&lt;/ref&gt;

This collaborative project between Banks and Lloyd was restarted in 2005 and although the groundwork of the project was completed to date it remains unreleased.   Lloyd spoke at length about his work with Banks at the 2014 Huddersfield Literature Festival&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litfest.org.uk/sites/default/files/docs/HUDDFESTIVAL_2014_WEB.pdf |format=PDF |title=Huddersfield Literature Festival 2014 Brochure |publisher=Litfest.org |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and about his work with Moore at the 2010 Magus Conference&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nectar.northampton.ac.uk/3798/1/Wiseman-Trowse20113798.pdf |format=PDF |title=Studies in Comics : Alan Moore Themed Issue 2:1 |publisher=Nectar.northampton.ac.uk |accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Northampton]].

==Company Carpi==
Company Carpi is the name of the dance theatre company established by Bettina Carpi and Gary Lloyd.  The company aim is to produce works which "combines music &amp; dance with other art forms to present imaginative live performance pieces which address societal topics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.https://www.companycarpi.com/about}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Company Carpi's first fully funded (by Arts Council England and other sources) production was ''The Mirror Of Love'' based on the prose-poem by [[Alan Moore]] which was first performed in 2017.  The company followed this in 2018 with ''Knots'' based on the book by revolutionary psychiatrist R.D. Laing.
==Works in progress==
Lloyd is currently working with Bettina Carpi on a dance theatre adaptation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mary-talbot.co.uk/dancetheatre-adaptation-of-dotter-of-her-fathers-eyes/|title=Dance/theatre adaptation of Dotter of her Father's Eyes|work=Mary Talbot's Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Mary M. Talbot|Mary Talbot]] and [[Bryan Talbot]]'s [[Costa Award]]-winning graphic novel '[[Dotter of her Father's Eyes]]'.  Lloyd, Carpi, the Talbots, and dancer Christopher Owen presented work in progress at the Huddersfield Literature Festival 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litfest.org.uk/?q=diary#Storytelling%20&amp;%20Adaptation|title=Huddersfield Literature Festival 2015|publisher=Litfest.org|accessdate=2 June 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150510155318/http://www.litfest.org.uk/?q=diary#Storytelling%20&amp;%20Adaptation |archivedate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The eventual form of the production will be opera with dance.

Lloyd is also currently in the preparatory stages of composing his first orchestral symphony.

'''''Harlequin with a Guitar''''' is an early 20th century painting by Spanish [[Cubism|cubist]] [[Juan Gris]]. Done in oil on panel, the work is in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/490068| title=metmuseum.org|website=www.metmuseum.org|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Harlequin with his checkered costume was a favorite theme of cubists and Gris himself portrayed him in approximately forty works between 1917 and 1925.

{{nihongo|'''''Jigoku'''''|地獄||"Hell"}}, also titled '''''The Sinners of Hell''''', is a [[1960 in film|1960]] Shintoho [[J-Horror|Japanese horror film]], directed by [[Nobuo Nakagawa]] and starring [[Utako Mitsuya]] and [[Shigeru Amachi]]. The 1960 film was advertised as adult entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994). ''Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films''. McFarland and Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;
''Jigoku'' is notable for separating itself from other [[J-horror|Japanese horror]] films of the era such as ''[[Kwaidan (film)|Kwaidan]]'' or ''[[Onibaba (film)|Onibaba]]'' due to its graphic imagery of torment in Hell.&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994). ''Japanese Fantasy, Science Fiction and Horror Films''. McFarland and Co., Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; It has gained a [[cult film]] status. Shintoho declared bankruptcy in 1961, its last production being ''Jigoku''.{{sfn|Galbraith IV|1994|p=317}}

''Jigoku'' was re-made in 1969 by Toho Films (as ''[[Portrait of Hell]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;, again in 1979 by Toei Films (as simply ''Jigoku''), and later re-made once again in 1999 by Toei under the title of ''[[Jigoku: Japanese Hell]]'', directed by [[Teruo Ishii]].&lt;ref&gt;Galbraith,Stuart (1994).

==Plot==
A young Tokyo theology student, Shirō (Shigeru Amachi), is set to marry his girlfriend, Yukiko (Utako Mitsuya), the daughter of his professor, Mr. Yajima. After announcing the engagement, Shirō's dark and unsettling colleague, Tamura (Yôichi Numata), drives Shirō home, suggesting that Shirō had been sleeping with Yukiko for some time. Taking a side street at Shirō's request, Tamura hits and kills drunken yakuza gang leader, Kyōichi. Though Shirō wants to stop, Tamura keeps driving, stating that it does not concern him and that ultimately, the murder is Shirō's fault for asking him to drive down the street. Unbeknown to either of them, Kyōichi's mother (Kiyoko Tsuji) witnessed everything and resolves to find and kill them.

Though Tamura feels no guilt for the murder, Shirō does and attempts to go to the police. After telling Yukiko of what happened, Shirō insists that they take a taxi cab to the police station, despite Yukiko's pleas to walk instead. While in the cab, Shirō hallucinates that Tamura is driving the cab, and it crashes, killing Yukiko. After her funeral, Shirō seeks solace in the arms of strip bar worker and Kyōichi's grieving girlfriend Yoko (Akiko Ono), who discovers Shirō's culpability for the hit-and-run after sleeping with him and, with Kyōichi's mother, plots revenge.

Shirō receives a telegram that his mother, Ito, who lives in a country-side retirement community run by his father, Gōzō, is dying and rushes to see her. There, he meets the other residents including a disgraced painter, Ensai, who is painting a portrait of Hell, a former reporter, Akagawa, a corrupt detective, Hariya, and the community doctor, Dr. Kasuma. He meets Sachiko (also played by Mitsuya), a nurse and Ensai's daughter, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Yukiko, and is taking care of his mother. During his stay, Shirō and Sachiko become close while each of the residents' sordid activities is revealed: While Shirō's mother lies dying, his father carries on an open affair and also cheats the community of its money by cutting corners; the painter is wanted for a crime in another city; the detective threatens to turn the painter in unless he gives him Sachiko to marry; and the doctor knows his diagnoses are wrong, but feels that seeking a second opinion is too cumbersome. Both Mr. and Mrs. Yajima, both despondent after Yukiko's death, arrive by train to pay their respects to Shirō's mother. Ito dies, and Ensai blames Gōzō; decades ago, he and Ito were lovers before Gōzō came between them and married her leaving her unhappy. Inexplicably, Tamura appears and reveals that each of the residents has some complicity in a murder: Mr. Yajima killed his comrade during the war, stealing his water for himself; both the detective and reporter framed or slandered innocent men who then both committed suicide; and the doctor knew his diagnosis of Ito's condition was wrong, but chose not to tell anyone.

Yoko tracks Shirō down and meets with him on a rope bridge in the area. There she reveals her identity and attempts to shoot him while Kyōichi's mother watches from the trees, but she trips and falls to her death. Tamura appears, and the two struggle over the gun, and Tamura also falls into the gorge. Shirō stumbles back in time for the community's tenth anniversary party, where Gōzō has knowingly allowed cheap, rancid fish to be served to the residents. As the party descends into debauchery, Mr. and Mrs. Yajima both decide to leap in front of the train, killing themselves, and Gōzō's mistress falls to her death following an altercation. The residents die from consuming the tainted fish, and Kyōichi's mother sneaks into the party, poisoning the remaining residents' wine, killing them. Tamura, near death, stumbles into the party and shoots Sachiko, while Kyōichi's mother strangles Shirō to death and then commits suicide.

In Limbo, Shirō encounters Yukiko, who reveals that she was pregnant with his child, a baby girl named "Harumi", but has sent her floating away on the river of the underworld and begs Shirō to save her. Shirō enters Hell and is sentenced to punishment in the Eight Realms of Hell by Lord [[Yama (Buddhism and Chinese mythology)|Enma]] for his sins. While running through Hell to find his daughter, he encounters each of his acquaintances, who suffer, in gruesome fashion, a variety of punishments for their sins, such as being boiled and burned alive, dismembered and flayed, or cut apart and beaten by ogres, only to be revived to suffer anew. Meanwhile, Tamura taunts Shirō, saying there is no escape from Hell, before being butchered for giving his soul over to evil. In a realm filled with glass shards jutting from the ground, Shirō finds Sachiko, but their reunion is interrupted by Shirō's mother, who shamefully reveals that Sachiko is his sister: Shirō is actually Ensai's son, and Sachiko is actually her daughter, also a product of her later affair with Ensai. Shirō is disgusted with his family, and continues searching for his daughter, determined to live and save her. While caught in a vortex of damned souls, he finds his baby daughter helplessly rotating on the Buddhist wheel of life. Lord Enma gives Shirō one chance to save his daughter, otherwise she too will suffer for all eternity in Hell. As Yukiko, Sachiko, and his mother call to him, Shirō leaps onto the wheel, but cannot reach his daughter.

The moment is frozen in time, revealed to be nine o'clock: the exact time that everyone at the party has finally died, including Ensai, who has hanged himself after completing his portrait of Hell and set it on fire. In a final scene, both Sachiko and Yukiko stand smiling in peaceful light, calling to Shirō as sister and lover, respectively, with lotus petals falling around them, symbolizing mental and moral purity.

==Production==
{{expand section|date=October 2015}}
[[Nobuo Nakagawa]] asked [[Ichirō Miyagawa]] to write the script, which was originally supposed to be called ''Heaven and Hell'', under order of [[Film producer|producer]] [[Mitsugu Okura]].&lt;ref name="Criterion Collection"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Ichirō Miyagawa|Miyagawa, Ichirō]] (Writer) |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitsugu Okura read the [[Screenplay|script]] and angrily said to Miyagawa that "Heaven is nowhere to be seen in this script!", to which Miyagawa jokingly replied that he would write about Heaven in the sequel.&lt;ref name="Criterion Collection"/&gt; Actor [[Yoichi Numata]] played Tamura in the film, and expressed that he had tried to analyze the role, but couldn't find the best way to play it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Yoichi Numata|Numata, Yoichi]] (Actor) |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was not expected to be well received, as [[Shintoho]] [[Film studio|studio]] was considered to be a maker of low-budget, gory films. ''Jigoku'' was made in a hurry, and was the last Shintoho production. For the scenes which take place in [[hell]], the cast and crew used Shintoho's largest soundstage and put dirt over it.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Mamoru Morita|Morita, Mamoru]] (Cinematographer) |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent documentary, a crew member said that normally it would be just the crew helping to build the sets, but because it was Shintoho's last production, all the [[Extra (actor)|extra]]s were helping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=2007-03-13 |title=Jigoku, DVD Extra: ''Building the Inferno |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Criterion Collection]] |time=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mamoru Morita]] said that Nobuo Nakagawa tried in many ways to make ''Jigoku'' different from other [[Horror Film|horror]] films from the time.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 1979, the acclaimed [[Nikkatsu]] Roman Porno director [[Tatsumi Kumashiro]] remade ''Jigoku'' for [[Toei Company|Toei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sharp|first=Jasper|title=Behind the Pink Curtain: The Complete History of Japanese Sex Cinema|page= 137|year=2008|publisher=FAB Press|location=Guildford|isbn=978-1-903254-54-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
===Later reception===
Later reviews of the film have been more positive, with many critics now recognizing it as a cornerstone for Nakagawa’s career.
[[Dennis Schwartz]] from ''[[Ozus' World Movie Reviews]]'' awarded the film a grade "A", calling it "[a] disquieting morality tale based upon the Buddhist concept of an afterlife". Schwartz praised the film's performances, and visuals which he felt 'acted as a lurid study of sin without salvation'.&lt;ref name="schwartz06"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schwartz |first1=Dennis |title=jigoku |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~ozus/jigoku.htm |website=Sover.net |publisher=Dennis Schwartz |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an [[Film essay|essay]] for the Criterion Collection, Chuck Stephens wrote, "Overflowing with brackish ponds of bubbling pus, brain-rattling disjunctions of sound and image, and at times almost dauntingly incomprehensible plot twists and eye-assaulting bouts of brutish montage, ''Jigoku'' is more than merely a boundary-pummeling classic of the horror genre—it’s as lurid a study of sin without salvation as the silver screen has ever seen."&lt;ref name="stephens06"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stephens |first1=Chuck |title=The Criterion Collection - The Current - Jigoku: Hell on Earth |url=https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/448-jigoku-hell-on-earth |website=Criterion.com |publisher=Chuck Stephens |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brett Gallman from ''Oh, the Horror!'' praised the film, calling it "a masterpiece in visual and abstract horror". Gallman praised the film's performances, eerie score, Nakagawa’s direction, and "vivid color palette".&lt;ref name="gallman10"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gallman |first1=Brett |title=Horror Reviews - Jigoku (1960) |url=http://www.oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=713 |website=Oh the Horror.com |publisher=Brett Gallman |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HorrorNews.net'' stated in their review of the film that, "Although this film contains effects that are outdated by modern standards, it is a very powerful story that is based upon the Buddhist belief that sins are atoned for in the afterlife."&lt;ref name="hnreview10"&gt;{{cite web |title=Film Review: Jigoku (1960) |url=http://horrornews.net/11385/film-review-jigoku-1960/ |website=HorrorNews.net |publisher=Scarlett OTerror |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has developed a [[cult film|cult following]] over the years and is now considered a cult classic.&lt;ref name="schwartz06" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cultfilm"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.criterion.com/explore/1-cult-movies|title=Cult Movies|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:J.B.Buckstone.jpg|thumb|John Baldwin Buckstone]]
'''John Baldwin Buckstone''' (14 September 1802 – 31 October 1879) was an English actor, playwright and comedian who wrote 150 plays, the first of which was produced in 1826.

He starred as a comic actor during much of his career for various periods at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] and the [[Haymarket Theatre]], managing the Haymarket from 1853 to 1877.

==Biography==
Buckstone was born in [[Hoxton]], London, the son of John Buckstone, a retired shopkeeper, and his wife Elizabeth (née Baldwin).&lt;ref&gt;[http://interactive.ancestry.co.uk/2056/32515_1831109331_0013-01511/852351?backurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ancestry.co.uk%2f%2fcgi-bin%2fsse.dll%3frank%3d1%26new%3d1%26MSAV%3d1%26gss%3dangs-c%26gsfn%3dJohn%2bBaldwin%2b%26gsln%3dBuckstone%26msbdy%3d1802%26msbpn__ftp%3dHoxton%252c%2bMiddlesex%252c%2bEngland%26msbpn%3d85853%26msbpn_PInfo%3d8-%257c0%257c0%257c3257%257c3251%257c0%257c0%257c0%257c5275%257c85853%257c0%257c%26msddy%3d1879%26msgdy%3d1857%26msydy%3d1857%26gskw%3dActor%26cpxt%3d1%26uidh%3drc8%26msbdm%3d9%26_83004003-n_xcl%3df%26cp%3d11%26mssng0%3dIsabella%26mssns0%3dCopeland%26pcat%3d34%26h%3d852351%26recoff%3d21%2b22%26db%3dSurreyMarriage%26indiv%3d1%26ml_rpos%3d19&amp;ssrc=&amp;backlabel=ReturnRecord London and Surrey, England, Marriage Bonds and Allegations, 1597–1921 for Elizabeth Baldwin], [[Ancestry.com]] (pay to view)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ODNB&gt;Roy, Donald. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/3876 "Buckstone, John Baldwin (1802–1879)"], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 3 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Walworth Grammar School and was briefly apprenticed on a naval ship at age 10 but returned to school. He studied law and was articled to a [[solicitor]] but turned to acting by age 19.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 1 November 1879, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early career===
Buckstone first joined a travelling troupe in 1821 as Gabriel in ''The Children in the Wood''.&lt;ref name=NYTimes&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1879/11/01/archives/death-of-jb-buckstone-a-veteran-actor-playwright-and-manager-the.html ''New York Times'' obituary], p. 2, 1 November 1879&lt;/ref&gt; and toured for three years, mostly in the southeast of England. He found a mentor in [[Edmund Kean]].  He made his first London appearance, on 30 January 1823, at the [[Surrey Theatre]], as Ramsay in ''[[The Fortunes of Nigel]]''.  In 1824 he joined that theatre and played Peter Smink in ''The Armistice'' with great success.  He also began to write plays.&lt;ref name=Waddy&gt;Waddy, Frederick. [https://archive.org/details/cartoonportraits00wadduoft ''Cartoon Portraits and Biographical Sketches of Men of the Day''], Tinsley brothers: London (1873)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buckstone.jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Buckstone]]
His successes led to his engagement in 1827 at the [[Adelphi Theatre]], where he remained as the leading low comedian until 1833. Buckstone's acting was described as "a union of shrewdness and drollery, with their interaction upon each other ... was irresistibly comic."&lt;ref&gt;Marston, Westland.  ''Our Recent Actors'' (Boston, 1888), vol. II, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Buckstone wrote most of his plays in the first half of his career, and many of these were produced at the Adelphi. As his acting career reached the height of its success, his playwriting output declined.&lt;ref name=utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3205899 "General Utility: Victorian Author-Actors from Knowles to Pinero",] ''Educational Theatre Journal'', Vol. 24, No. 3, October 1972, pp. 289–301, The Johns Hopkins University Press&lt;/ref&gt; At the Adelphi, he appeared as Bobby Trot in his first really successful play, the melodrama ''Luke the Labourer'' (1827), which he had written in 1826.&lt;ref name=utility/&gt; Other well known plays were ''Wreck Ashore'' (1830) and ''Forgery'' (1832)&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; Perhaps the most successful of these early plays was his 1833 play, ''The Bravo'', based on [[James Fenimore Cooper]]'s [[The Bravo|novel of the same name]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

===Peak years===
He first appeared at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] during the summer season in 1833, also writing plays for this theatre, including ''Ellen Wartham'' (1833).  Another hit for the Haymarket was the drama ''Thirty Years of a Woman's Life''.  At that theatre, his acting was praised in ''The Housekeeper'' by [[Douglas Jerrold]] (1833), ''Pyramus and Thisbe'', and in his own plays, ''Uncle John'', ''Rural Felicity'' and ''Agnes de Vere'' (all in 1834). He stayed at the Haymarket until 1838, producing ''The Dream at Sea'' among other plays.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

In 1839–40 he returned to the Adelphi to write and star in a number of plays, including his extraordinarily successful play ''[[Jack Sheppard]]'', based on the [[Jack Sheppard (novel)|novel of the same name]] published that year by [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]. After his return from a visit to the United States in 1840, where he met with little success, Buckstone played in his own play, ''Married Life'', at the Haymarket. He then appeared at several London theatres, among them the [[Lyceum Theatre (London)|Lyceum]], where he was Box at the first representation of ''[[Box and Cox (farce)|Box and Cox]]'', by [[John Maddison Morton]], in 1847.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalengineers.ca/BoxandCox02.html ''Box and Cox'']&lt;/ref&gt;  There he also created the role of Bob, in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''Old Heads and Young Hearts'', and played several other memorable roles, including, Slowboy in ''Cricket on the Hearth'', Dan in ''[[John Bull]]'', MacDunnum of Dunnum in ''A School for Scheming'', Scrub in ''[[The Beaux' Stratagem]]'' and Golightly in ''Lend Me Five Shillings'', and several [[Shakespeare]] roles. For the Adelphi, he wrote ''The Green Bushes'' and ''The Flowers of the Forest'', both in 1847.  He also dramatised ''[[The Last Days of Pompeii]]''.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes/&gt;

He returned to the Haymarket in 1848, writing and playing in ''An Alarming Sacrifice'', ''Leap Year'' and ''A Serious Family''. During this period, he memorably played Moses in Stirling Coyne's adaptation of ''[[The Vicar of Wakefield]]'', Appleface in Jerrold's ''Catspaw'', Shadowly Softhead in [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Baron Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s ''Not as Bad as We Seem'' and in many Shakespeare productions with Mr. and Mrs. [[Charles Kean]].&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:W.S. Gilbert's burlesque comedy, Engaged.jpg|''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' at the Haymarket in 1877|thumb|right|250px]]
He became lessee of the Haymarket from 1853 to 1877. For this theatre, he continued to write plays and [[farce]]s, though markedly fewer than before. As manager of the Haymarket, he surrounded himself with an admirable and effective ensemble company, including [[Edward Askew Sothern]], [[Henry Compton (actor)|Henry Compton]], Mr. and Mrs. [[Charles James Mathews]] and [[William Hunter Kendal|the Kendals]]. He produced the plays of [[James Planché]], [[Thomas William Robertson]], [[Tom Taylor]], [[John Oxenford]], [[H. J. Byron]] and [[W. S. Gilbert]], as well as his own, and in most of these he acted.  Buckstone's management made the Haymarket into the premier comedy theatre of the age.  Buckstone's own gifts in comedy contributed much to the theatre's remarkable success. According to ''The Times'', "Few men... have possessed to a greater extent the power of communicating the spirit of mirth to an audience. ... He was helped, too, in his vocation by remarkable physical attributes" and a peculiar, hilarious voice.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

In the 1850s, Buckstone produced ''An Unequal Match'' and Taylor's ''The Overland Route'', ''A Hero of Romance'' by Westland Marston, and ''Home'' by Robertson.  In 1862, Buckstone produced a 496-night run of ''[[Our American Cousin]]'', with Sothern in his most famous role as [[Lord Dundreary]]. Robertson's ''[[David Garrick (play)|David Garrick]]'' was a hit in 1864, also with Sothern in the title role. W. S. Gilbert premiered seven of his plays at the Haymarket during this time including his blank verse "fairy comedies" starring the Kendals, such as ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' (1871)  and ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873).  Buckstone also produced Gilbert's dramas, ''[[Charity (play)|Charity]]'' (1874) and ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876), as well as his 1877 farce ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]''. In 1873 Buckstone introduced the innovation of matinées starting at 2.00 pm.  By the mid-1870s, however, Buckstone's company was disbanding, and in 1877, ill and bankrupt after sustaining heavy losses, he gave up management of the theatre.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;

===Personal life, death and ghost===
Buckstone was first married in 1828 to Anne Maria Honeyman,&lt;ref&gt;Parish Register (marriages) of St John the Evangelist, Lambeth, 1828, p. 168, No.502; London Metropolitan Archives&lt;/ref&gt; with whom he had at least five children&lt;ref&gt;Parish Registers (births) of: St John the Evangelist, Lambeth; St Mary, Lambeth; Holy Trinity, Brompton; Caterham Church (Bishop's Transcripts); London Metropolitan Archives&lt;/ref&gt; before she died in 1844.&lt;ref&gt;Register of Deaths Index, 1844 Q3, vol. 3, p. 89, General Register Office, London&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, Buckstone was closely associated with the actress [[Fanny Fitzwilliam|Fanny Copeland Fitzwilliam]], who was widowed in 1852 and whom he was engaged to marry in 1854. She died of cholera a month before the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Joseph. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/9657/?back=,3876 "Fitzwilliam, Fanny Elizabeth (1801–1854)"], rev. J. Gilliland, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press (2004), accessed 3 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In 1857 Buckstone married Fanny's cousin Isabella Copeland, the great-niece of the theatre manager [[Robert Copeland (theatre manager)|Robert Copeland]], and they had 12 children between 1857 and 1876.&lt;ref&gt;General Register Office, London, for the years from 1857 to 1876&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, [[Lucy Isabella Buckstone]] and their sons [[J. C. Buckstone|John Copeland Buckstone]] and Rowland Buckstone also took to the stage.&lt;ref&gt;Parker, John. [https://books.google.com/books?id=_MMzAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA71 "Buckstone, J. C."], ''Who's Who in the Theatre'', 1916, p. 71. Retrieved 29 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of ill health, Buckstone died at his home in Lower [[Sydenham]] in 1879 at the age of 77.

According to director Nigel Everett and stagehands at the Haymarket Theatre, Buckstone's ghost has often been seen at the theatre, particularly during comedies and "when he appreciates things" playing there.&lt;ref name=ghost&gt;Adams, Stephen. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/theatre-news/6087811/Patrick-Stewart-saw-ghost-performing-Waiting-for-Godot.html "Patrick Stewart saw ghost performing Waiting for Godot",] ''The Daily Telegraph'', 25 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2009, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that the actor [[Patrick Stewart]] saw the ghost standing in the wings during a performance of ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'' at the Haymarket.&lt;ref name=ghost/&gt;

[[File:Paul Cézanne 146.jpg|400px|thumb|[[Paul Cézanne]], ''L'Estaque, Melting Snow'', c. 1871, 28.75 cm × 36.25 cm. Private collection.]]

'''''L'Estaque, Melting Snow''''' is a c. 1871 oil-on-canvas painting by French [[Post-Impressionism|Post-Impressionist]] artist [[Paul Cézanne]]. It shows a view from the outskirts of [[L'Estaque]], a small village near [[Marseille]], with a steep hillside covered in a  drift of melting snow underneath a foreboding dark grey sky.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, 111&lt;/ref&gt; Filled with intense emotion, the painting has been described as similar to the work of [[Vincent van Gogh]] the following decade, and a painting more formally similar to early 20th-century than contemporaneous art.&lt;ref name="S54"&gt;Schapiro, 54&lt;/ref&gt; ''L'Estaque, Melting Snow'' was painted in a single session.&lt;ref name="A63"/&gt; It is one of only two snow-laden winter subjects Cézanne painted.&lt;ref name="A63"/&gt;

Cézanne moved to [[Provence]] in 1870 to evade military service during the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. He soon moved to L'Estaque, where he painted a number of landscapes.&lt;ref&gt;Athanassoglou-Kallmyer, 216&lt;/ref&gt; Critics differ in their interpretation of this painting, some see it as wholly personal, other as a response to the war with Prussia. Supporting the latter view, [[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]] saw the painting as making a statement on social and political transformation and wrote of the political context in which it was created, "what is our response to those red-roofed houses which are held, as if in a vice, between a leaden sky and a sliding block of snow?"&lt;ref&gt;Tymieniecka, 148&lt;/ref&gt;

The colors are oppressively dark, while the thickly painted, quick brushwork adds to the urgent violence of the scene. With the exception of the red rooftops and the greens of the trees in the foreground, the colors and the tones are monotonous and gloomy. The whites, greys and blacks are used mostly for emotional impact.&lt;ref name="S54"/&gt; Though ''L'Estaque, Melting Snow'' evidences Cézanne's new-found facility in depicting the deep space of a landscape, it is marked by an emotional intensity closer in spirit to the turbulence of his early figure works than to the structural complexity of the later landscape paintings.&lt;ref name="A63"&gt;Adriani, 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The diagonal of the hill cuts across the painting from left to right, dividing avalanche on one side and gloom on the other. The hill sweeps down until it rests just above the red roof of a barely visible house at its foot—an effect that art critic [[Meyer Schapiro]] described as giving "a rushing force to the image."&lt;ref name="S54" /&gt; The dark brown trees on the slope's ledge have twisted trunks and rest on unsteady ground, while the trees in the mid-ground are painted in black and form a descending arch which moves inwards towards the center of the canvas before merging with the ominous overhanging clouds. Given the angle of the hill and the depth from which the houses are viewed, it is difficult to imagine where the observer is supposed to be positioned. 

Writer Ronald Berman drew comparison between Cézanne's treatment of this landscape and the way [[Ernest Hemingway]] imbues the Irati River in [[Navarre]] with emotional scope in his 1926 novel on the [[lost generation]], ''[[The Sun Also Rises]]''. In both, the landscape is subjective and the viewpoint of the observer is paramount—the landscape is representational and perceived differently by each character. According to Berman, "The foreground is the observer's space". In the Cézanne, nature becomes an extension of the observer's mental landscape, and in Hemingway it is a representation of each viewer's need for inclusion within the natural order.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Ronald. "Translating Modernism: Fitzgerald and Hemingway". University of Alabama Press, 2011. 59. {{ISBN|978-0-8173-5665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''L.A.

==Background==
In June 1953, [[Ike Jones]] became the first African American to graduate from the UCLA Film School.&lt;ref name='Jet-16Oct1952'&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-first=John H. |editor1-last=Johnson |date=October 16, 1952 |title=Football Player To Pioneer In Hollywood Films |journal=Jet |volume=2 |issue=25 |page=54 |publisher=Johnson Publishing Company, Inc. |location=Chicago, Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the next 15 years, the numbers of African-American filmmakers remained small.  One of those was [[Vantile Whitfield]], who founded the Performing Arts Society of Los Angeles in 1964 and received a master's degree at UCLA in 1967.&lt;ref name='Post-Obit'&gt;{{cite news |title=Arts Administrator, Playwright Vantile Whitfield Dies |author= |first=Yvonne |last=Shinhoster Lamb |authorlink= |authorlink2= |author2= |author3= |author4= |author5= |author6= |author7= |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A29685-2005Jan22 |format= |agency= |newspaper=Washington Post |publisher= |location=Washington, DC |isbn= |issn= |oclc= |pmid= |pmd= |bibcode= |doi= |id= |date=2005-01-23 |page= |pages= |at= |accessdate=2011-11-13 |language= |trans-title=|quote=He graduated with a bachelor's degree in theater and design from Howard University in 1957 and a master's degree in film production from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1967.

Among this new crop of artists were [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]], an engineering student who had attended [[Los Angeles City College]], and [[Haile Gerima]], an Ethiopian filmmaker who had recently moved from Chicago. Unlike their predecessors, they eschewed Hollywood conventions and were influenced by films from Latin America, [[Italian neorealism]], European art films, and the emerging [[cinema of Africa]].  They were among the first of what became known as the "Los Angeles School of Black Filmmakers."&lt;ref name='Washington-Post'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Images'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue05/features/black.htm |title=Black Independent Cinema and the Influence of Neo-Realism |first=Chris |last=Norton |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work=Images: A Journal of Film and Popular Culture |publisher= |location= |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate=2011-10-02 |quote=Most notable of these filmmakers were Charles Burnett, Billy Woodberry, Haile Gerima and Julie Dash.

In the wake of the [[Watts Riots]] and other forms of [[Rebellion|social unrest]], such as a 1969 shoot-out on the UCLA campus involving [[Ron Karenga]]'s US Organization, Burnett and several other students of color helped push the university to start an [[Ethnographic film|ethnographic]] studies program.&lt;ref name='LAWeekly-6Oct2011'/&gt; Elyseo J.

[[Teshome Gabriel]], a film scholar and historian, began teaching at UCLA in 1974 and became both a colleague and mentor to many filmmakers associated with the movement.&lt;ref name='Gabriel-Obit'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/news/obituary/738-teshome-gabriel_obit/ |title=Cinema &amp; Media Studies professor was an internationally recognized expert on Third World Cinema |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=2010-06-10 |month= |year= |work= |publisher=UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television |location=Los Angeles, California |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|format= |arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate= |quote=As a faculty member and student at TFT in the 1970s and early 1980s, Gabriel was both a colleague of and a mentor to the African-American and African student filmmakers whose work came to define the Los Angeles School of Black Filmmakers, also known as the "L.A. Rebellion." The group included such soon-to-be-celebrated artists as Charles Burnett, Larry Clark, Julie Dash, Haile Gerima, Ben Caldwell, Billy Woodberry, Alile Sharon Larkin, Jacqueline Frazier, Jamaa Fanaka and Barbara McCullough. The UCLA Film &amp; Television Archive is currently preparing a major film exhibition scheduled for 2011 which will explore this key artistic movement.|ref= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification of movement==
Film scholar [[Clyde Taylor]] coined the term "L.A. Rebellion" to describe the filmmakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cinema.ucla.edu/blogs/archival-spaces/2011/10/28/what%E2%80%99s-name-la-rebellion|title=What's in a Name? L.A.

In the spring of 1997, Doc Films, a student-run film society based at the [[University of Chicago]], hosted one of the first retrospectives of L.A. Rebellion films. [[Jacqueline Stewart]], an associate professor at the university, helped coordinate the program.  This series included works by [[Charles Burnett (director)|Charles Burnett]], [[Haile Gerima]] and [[Julie Dash]].&lt;ref name='Doc-LAR'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blackfilm.uchicago.edu/campus_resources/doc_films.shtml |title=Doc Films |first= |last= |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |month= |year= |work= |publisher=University of Chicago |location=Chicago, Illinois |page= |pages= |at= |language= |trans-title=|arxiv= |asin= |bibcode= |doi= |doibroken= |isbn= |issn= |jfm= |jstor= |lccn= |mr= |oclc= |ol= |osti= |pmc = |embargo= |pmid= |rfc= |ssrn= |zbl= |id= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |deadurl= |accessdate= |quote= |ref= |postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Fall 2011, UCLA Film and Television Archive programmed a major retrospective of these films entitled, "L.A. Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema." The series was funded by the Getty Foundation as a part of ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980''.&lt;ref name="UCLA-LAR" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LAWeekly-6Oct2011" /&gt; Preceding the program, the UCLA curatorial team conducted oral histories, identifying nearly fifty filmmakers, many of whom had remained invisible for decades. Papers and films by the filmmakers were collected and numerous films were preserved before screening. A catalog was also published, "L.A. Rebellion: Creating a New Black Cinema (Los Angeles, 2011), which accompanied the touring program through more than fifteen cities in North America and Europe.

* ''[[Such Men Are Dangerous]]'' (1930), released just over two months after [[Kenneth Hawks]]'s death in a two-plane crash over the [[Pacific Ocean]], while directing re-takes of aerial scenes for the film; Hawks, the younger brother of fellow director [[Howard Hawks]], was killed along with pilot Walter Ross Cook, cameraman [[George Eastman]], assistant director Ben Frankel, assistant director Max Gold, Tom Harris, Harry Johannes, Otho Jordan, pilot Halleck Rouse, and cinematographer [[Conrad Wells]] (also known as Abraham Fried).

* ''[[Titanic (1943 film)|Titanic]]'' (1943), released a year after [[Herbert Selpin]]'s supposed [[suicide]]. The film was completed by [[Werner Klingler]] who was not credited.

Within days, Frissell and his crew re-joined the SS ''Viking'' (already used in the film) for its annual seal hunt to shoot more footage; however, the ship quickly became trapped in ice about {{convert|8|mi|km|spell=in}} off the [[Horse Islands (Newfoundland and Labrador)|Horse Islands]]. On March 15, 1931, while trying to film an iceberg, Frissell, cinematographer Alexander Gustavus Penrod, and 25&lt;ref name="Andrew McIntosh"/&gt; other film crew members were killed when a cache of [[dynamite]] loaded on the vessel, being used for Frissell's film to add to the sensationalism of giant explosions of [[iceberg]]s, spontaneously blew up, destroying the back of the ship, blowing the stern off the vessel, and causing the ''Viking'' to catch fire and sink.&lt;ref name="Rist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rhodes95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Film and Video - Early Days"/&gt; The film that had been screened at the Nickel Theatre was subsequently polished and prepared for release by associate producer Roy W. Gates, who directed a prologue featuring Newfoundland explorer Sir [[Wilfred Grenfell]], who had known and worked with Frissell, lionizing the producer and the men who had died with him. A French-language version of the film, ''Ceux du "Viking"'', shot simultaneously with Melford's English-language version by French director René Ginet and also produced by Frissell and featuring his nature footage, was released in February 1932, 11 months after Frissell's death.

* ''[[A Dash Through the Clouds]]'' (1912), released just twenty-three days after aviator and actor [[Philip Orin Parmelee]]'s death in a plane crash; he was piloting an airplane at an air show in [[Yakima, Washington]], on June 1, 1912, at altitudes variously described from 400 to 2,000 feet, when air turbulence flipped over his airplane and caused it to crash, killing him instantly.&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Aviator Parmelee Plunges to Death.

* ''A Woman's Way'' (1913), ''In the Haunts of Fear'' (1913), and ''The Blight'' (1913), all released after [[Joseph Graybill]]'s death at the age of 26—strangely, different records state conflicting information as to the cause of Graybill's death; the [[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDB) lists it as acute [[spinal meningitis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0337033/|title=Joseph Graybill|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first death notice in the ''[[New York Times]]'' contradicts the death certificate as to the day of death—it lists the cause of death on August 2, not the 3, as a [[nervous breakdown]]&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 2, 1913, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt;—but an obituary on August 4 lists the cause as [[gastritis]].&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'', August 4, 1913, page 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Contradicting all of these, a 1913 ''Motion Picture Story'' magazine article states that he had a ''"nervous disorder of the optic nerve and died"''. Finally, Graybill's death certificate states that the cause of death was acute pachymeningitis and a contributory factor was [[alcohol poisoning]]; both the certificate and the first death notice note he entered [[Bellevue Hospital]] on July 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.health.state.ny.us/vital_records/|title=Birth, Death, Marriage &amp; Divorce Records|work=state.ny.us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Across the Border'' (1914), released over a month after Grace McHugh's death during filming; while on location on the [[Arkansas River]] in [[Colorado]], re-shooting a scene of McHugh fording the river on horseback, her horse lost its footing, and the actress was thrown into the swift current. Cinematographer Owen Carter stopped filming and plunged into the river to save her; together they succeeded in reaching a sandbar, which unfortunately proved to be quicksand, and they both drowned. Shooting of the picture was otherwise complete, and the film was released with the majority of Grace McHugh's work intact.
* ''The Great Romance'' (1919), ''Shadows of Suspicion'' (1919), and ''A Man of Honor'' (1919), all released after [[Harold Lockwood]]'s death in the [[1918 flu pandemic]]; because he died before filming on ''Shadows of Suspicion'' was completed, changes were made to the script, and the film was completed using a double shot from behind to stand in for Lockwood.
* ''The Lone Star Ranger'' (1919), ''Wolves of the Night'' (1919), ''The Last of the Duanes'' (1919), and ''The Spite Bride'' (1919), all released after [[Lamar Johnstone]]'s sudden death at age 34 from [[heart disease]].

===1920s===
* ''[[The Skywayman]]'' (1920), released just over a month after daredevil stunt flier and actor [[Ormer Locklear]]'s death on the last day of filming; while shooting the finale by night, Locklear had to dive the plane, carrying himself and co-pilot Milton 'Skeets' Elliott, towards some oil derricks and appear to crash it. He forewarned the lighting crew to douse their lights when he got near the derricks, so that he could see to pull out of the dive; the lights remained full on, blinding him, and he crashed. The finished film showed this crash, and its aftermath, in gruesome detail.
* ''[[Everybody's Sweetheart (1920 film)|Everybody's Sweetheart]]'' (1920), released less than a month after [[Olive Thomas]]'s death, at the age of 25; on the night of September 5, 1920, Thomas and her husband, [[Jack Pickford]], went out for a night of entertainment and partying at the famous bistros in the [[Montparnasse]] Quarter of Paris. Returning to their room in the [[Hotel Ritz Paris|Hotel Ritz]] around 3:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., Pickford either fell asleep or was outside the room for a final round of drugs. An intoxicated and tired Thomas accidentally ingested a large dose of a [[Mercury(II) chloride|mercury bichloride]] liquid solution, which had been prescribed for her husband's chronic [[syphilis]]. Being liquid it was supposed to be applied topically, not ingested.&lt;ref name="public.asu.edu_top"&gt;Long, Bruce. Editor.

Issue 33, September 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; She had either thought the flask contained drinking water or sleeping pills; accounts vary. The label was in [[French language|French]], which may have added to the confusion. She screamed, "Oh, my God!", and Pickford ran to pick her up in his arms; however, it was too late, as she had already ingested a lethal dose.&lt;ref name="silentsgolden_top"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.silentsaregolden.com/articles/lpolivethomasdeath.html|title=''The Mysterious Death of Olive Thomas''|author= Lussier, Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was taken to the [[American Hospital of Paris|American Hospital]] in the Paris suburb of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], where she succumbed to the poison a few days later.
* ''[[Coincidence (1921 film)|Coincidence]]'' (1921), released a year after [[Robert Harron]]'s suicide; he fatally shot himself in the left lung with a revolver due to disappointment that director and mentor [[D.W. Griffith]] had passed him over for the starring role in ''[[Way Down East]]''.
* ''[[Foolish Wives]]'' (1922), released almost a year after Rudolph Christians's death from pneumonia; the [[Cinema of Germany|German actor]], father of [[Cinema of Austria|Austrian stage and screen actress]] [[Mady Christians]], was playing the central part of the cuckolded American envoy in [[Erich von Stroheim]]'s film. As Christians died in the middle of production, von Stroheim was forced to bring in actor [[Robert Edeson]] (back to camera) to finish Christians's scenes.
* ''[[Wildness of Youth]]'' (1922), released nearly two months after child star [[Bobby Connelly]]'s death from [[bronchitis]], brought on by a years-long battle with [[endocarditis]] and worsened by a heavy work schedule; Connelly was 13 years old.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C05E3DA1539EF3ABC4F53DFB1668389639EDE New York Times "BOBBY" CONNELLY DEAD.; Child Screen Star Dies of Bronchitis at His Home...(Friday July 7, 1922)]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* ''[[The Warrens of Virginia (1924 film)|The Warrens of Virginia]]'' (1924), almost a year after actress [[Martha Mansfield]]'s death at the age of 24; on November 30, 1923, while working on the film on location in [[San Antonio, Texas]], Mansfield was severely [[burn]]ed when a [[match]], tossed by a cast member, ignited her [[American Civil War|Civil War]] costume of [[Hoop skirt|hoopskirts]] and flimsy ruffles. Mansfield was playing the role of Agatha Warren and had just finished her scenes and retired to a car when her clothing burst into flames. Her neck and face were saved when leading man Wilfred Lytell threw his heavy [[overcoat]] over her. The [[chauffeur]] of Mansfield's car was burned badly on his hands while trying to remove the burning clothing from the actress. The fire was put out, but she sustained substantial burns to her body. She was rushed to a Physicians and Surgeons Hospital in San Antonio, where she died in less than twenty-four hours; however, most of Mansfield's scenes had already been shot, so production on the film continued.
* ''[[Greed (film)|Greed]]'' (1924), released nearly a year after [[Frank Hayes (actor)|Frank Hayes]]'s death from [[pneumonia]].
* ''[[The Son of the Sheik]]'' (1926), was publicly released a month following [[Rudolph Valentino]]'s death from [[peritonitis]], although the premiere was a month prior to Valentino's death.
* ''King of the Pack'' (1926), released nearly four months after [[Animals in film and television#Dogs|canine actor]] Peter the Great's death while protecting his master; an argument had broken out between owner Edward Faust and a friend of Faust's, culminating with Faust running back to his car while the friend came out of his house with a rifle—in the process, Peter leapt up to protect his master, and was shot in the neck, lingering for three more days before dying.
* ''Two Masters'' (1928), released nearly a month after [[Rex Cherryman]]'s death from [[Sepsis|septic poisoning]], which he contracted while sailing to France to read for a play in Paris; he died in [[Le Havre, France]] at age 31.

* ''[[The Hottentot]]'' (1929), ''[[The Argyle Case]]'' (1929), and ''The Drake Case'' (1929), all released after [[Gladys Brockwell]]'s death in an [[automobile accident]]; the car, driven by her friend Thomas Brennan, went over an {{convert|75|ft|m|adj=on}} embankment on the Ventura Highway near Calabasas, and Brockwell, the passenger, ended up crushed beneath it. Brennan later said that a bit of dust had blown into his eye before the accident, temporarily blinding him. Seriously injured, Brockwell died a few days later in a [[Hollywood]] hospital from [[peritonitis]]; Brennan eventually recovered from his own injuries.

* ''Wake Up and Dream'' (1934), released just over a month after [[Russ Columbo]]'s death in a shooting accident; the singer was shot under peculiar circumstances by his longtime friend, [[photographer]] [[Lansing Brown]], while Columbo was visiting him at home. Brown had a collection of firearms and the two men were examining various pieces. Quoting Brown's description of the accident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=2vUtAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R9UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6031,2312618&amp;dq=russ+columbo&amp;hl=en|title=Russ Columbo Dies By Accidental Shot|date=3 September 1934|publisher=The Miami News|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"I was absent-mindedly fooling around with one of the guns.

* ''[[Jew Suss (1934 film)|Jew Suss]]'' (1934), released six months after [[Gerald du Maurier]]'s death from [[colon cancer]].
* ''[[Steamboat Round the Bend]]'' (1935) and ''[[In Old Kentucky (1935 film)|In Old Kentucky]]'' (1935), both released months after [[Will Rogers]]'s death in an airplane crash; while being flown through Alaska by famed aviator [[Wiley Post]], they became uncertain of their position in bad weather and landed in a lagoon to ask directions. On takeoff, the engine failed at low altitude, and the aircraft, uncontrollably nose-heavy at low speed, plunged into the lagoon, shearing off the right wing and ending inverted in the shallow water of the lagoon; both men died instantly.
* ''[[The Prisoner of Shark Island]]'' (1936), released fifteen days after [[O.P. Heggie]]'s death from [[pneumonia]].

* ''[[Rikas tyttö]]'' (1939), released less than two months after [[Cinema of Finland|Finnish actress]] [[Sirkka Sari]]'s death; Sari played the lead role in the film. At a party with the rest of the cast and crew, while shooting at the [[:fi:Aulanko|Aulanko]] Hotel, Sari and one of the men there (she was engaged, but the man was ''not'' her fiancée) went up to the roof of the hotel; on the flat roof, there was a several-feet high [[chimney]], with a ladder leading up to the top. Sari mistook this chimney for a scenery [[balcony]], climbed up, and fell into a heating [[boiler]], where she died instantly. Because of Sari's death, the end of the film needed to be changed a bit; the crew shot further away, and so another woman had to replace Sari on these final shots. It was only Sari's third film; she was 19 years old.

===1940s===
* ''[[To Be or Not to Be (1942 film)|To Be or Not to Be]]'' (1942), released one month after [[Carole Lombard]]'s death in a plane crash.
* ''[[Above Suspicion (1943 film)|Above Suspicion]]'' (1943), released one month after [[Conrad Veidt]]'s death from a [[heart attack]].
* ''[[The Masked Marvel]]'' (1943), released two months after [[David Bacon (actor)|David Bacon]]'s mysterious death; he was seen driving a car erratically in [[Santa Monica, California]] before running off the road and into the curb. Several witnesses saw him climb out of the car and stagger briefly before collapsing. As they approached, he asked them to help him, but he died before he could say anything more. A small knife wound was found in his back &amp;ndash; the blade had punctured his lung and caused his death. When he died, Bacon was wearing only a swimsuit, and a wallet and camera were found in his car. The film from the camera was developed and found to contain only one image, that of Bacon, nude and smiling on a beach.
* ''[[Captain America (serial)|Captain America]]'' (1944), whose later segments arrived at theatres following [[Dick Purcell]]'s death from a heart attack, just a few weeks after shooting had wrapped.

* ''[[Lost City of the Jungle]]'' (1946), following [[Lionel Atwill]]'s death, from [[pneumonia]] caused by poor health due to [[lung cancer]], while filming this serial; Atwill was playing the mastermind villain, Sir Eric Hazarias, a chief foreign spy. [[Universal Studios|Universal]] could not afford to throw out the footage already filmed, so they were forced to adapt the serial: Firstly, another villain (Malborn, played by [[John Mylong]], who was originally just a servant of Sir Eric) was introduced as the boss of Atwill's character to take over most of the villain requirements of the film; secondly, a double of Atwill was used to complete his remaining scenes. The double was filmed from behind and remained silent. The villain's henchmen were filmed repeating their orders back to the silent double and stock footage of Atwill was edited in to show a response.
* ''[[The Walls Came Tumbling Down (film)|The Walls Came Tumbling Down]]'' (1946) and ''[[The Imperfect Lady (1947 film)|The Imperfect Lady]]'' (1947), both released after [[Miles Mander]]'s death from a heart attack.
* ''[[Magic Town]]'' (1947), released over ten months after [[Donald Meek]]'s death from [[leukaemia]].
* ''[[The Naked City]]'' (1948), released over two months after producer and narrator [[Mark Hellinger]]'s death from a sudden heart attack; after Hellinger's death, executives at Universal Studios were ready to scrap the film, as they had no idea how to market it, and feared it would be a box office failure. Hellinger's widow, however, reminded the studio that Hellinger's contract for the film included a ''"guarantee of release"'' clause from Universal; having no choice, Universal released the film into theaters, and were subsequently surprised when it became a hit, garnering two Oscars for the studio.
* ''[[Noose (film)|Noose]]'' (1948) and ''[[Brass Monkey (film)|Brass Monkey]]'' (1948), both released after [[Carole Landis]]'s suicide; Landis was reportedly crushed when her lover, actor [[Rex Harrison]], refused to divorce his wife, [[Lilli Palmer]], for her. Unable to cope any longer, she committed suicide at her [[Pacific Palisades, California|Pacific Palisades]] home by taking an overdose of [[Secobarbital|Seconal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert |title=The Hollywood Book of Death: The Bizarre, Often Sordid, Passings of More Than 125 American Movie and TV Idols|publisher=Contemporary Books|year=2002|edition=3|page=315|isbn=0-8092-2227-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gans|first=Eric Lawrence|title=Carole Landis: A Most Beautiful Girl|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4m7nPlavJi8C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;ct=result#PPA199,M1|accessdate=13 June 2009|year=2008|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-013-5|pages=197–199 |chapter=The Good Die Young (1948)}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had spent her final night alive with Harrison; the next afternoon, he and the maid discovered her on the bathroom floor.

* ''[[Red River (1948 film)|Red River]]'' (1948) and ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]'' (1949), both released after [[Harry Carey (actor)|Harry Carey]]'s death from a combination of [[lung cancer]], [[emphysema]], and [[coronary thrombosis]] in 1947; both films had been delayed due to lengthy post-production problems, including the addition of several animated sequences to the latter, a Disney film.

===1950s===

* ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1951), released over a year after the death of [[Dink Trout]], who voiced the King of Hearts, and two months after the death of [[Larry Grey]], who voiced Bill the Lizard and a card painter.
* ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952), eight months after [[Robert Walker (actor, born 1918)|Robert Walker]]'s death, from an allergic reaction to [[sodium amytal]] given to him by his psychiatrist. Because Walker died in the middle of production, parts of the film were heavily rewritten; several scenes use a double shot from behind, and others recycle footage of Walker from ''[[Strangers on a Train (film)|Strangers on a Train]]''. The final scene, where a recording of John delivers an anti-Communist speech, is lit with a halo around the tape-recorder.
* ''[[All the Brothers Were Valiant]]'' (1953), released three months after [[Lewis Stone]]'s death from a heart attack.

He died having filmed two minutes of footage.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; This footage, not shot for ''Plan 9'', but for two separate, unfinished [[Ed Wood]] projects, was combined and then inter-cut with new footage featuring a double, [[Tom Mason]], who looked nothing like Lugosi, in order to put a credit for Lugosi on the picture.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;
* ''[[Solomon and Sheba]]'' (1959), following [[Tyrone Power]]'s death of a sudden heart attack; having completed 75 per cent of the required shooting, Power's death forced the production to recast the role with [[Yul Brynner]] and reshoot most of Power's scenes. Footage of Power, however, was retained for long shots, such as in the sword fighting sequence toward the end of the film, and reels featuring the rest of Power's performance are rumored to be kept locked away in vaults to this day.

* ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'' (1968), released seven months after [[Al Mulock]]'s suicide; Mulock, a noted [[Cinema of Canada|Canadian]] [[character actor]], played the gunslinger Knuckles in the opening sequence. This sequence, the last filmed in Spain on the production, was scheduled for four days; Mulock committed suicide after the third day's shooting, for reasons that are still unclear, by jumping from his hotel room window, several floors up, in full costume. Production manager Claudio Mancini and screenwriter Mickey Knox, who were sitting in a room in the hotel, witnessed Mulock's body pass by their window. Knox recalled in an interview that while Mancini put Mulock, still in his costume, in his car to drive him to the hospital, [[Cinema of Italy|director]] [[Sergio Leone]] said to Mancini, "Get the costume! We need the costume!" As Mulock had already shot most of his close-ups and a few medium and wide shots, only a double, of similar height and build, was needed to complete the sequence; looking similar enough to pass, screenwriter Knox was drafted into taking Mulock's place for those shots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fistful-of-leone.com/articles/knox.html |title=Articles |publisher=Fistful-of-Leone |date= |accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mulock's absence is obvious in the last few minutes of the sequence; while the other two gunslingers, played by [[Woody Strode]] and [[Jack Elam]], get close-up reaction shots to [[Charles Bronson]]'s character, Knuckles gets none before he is shot to death.

[[File:Самодельный магнитофон 1970ых.jpg|thumb|right|Tape recorder "Tembr" (1964) without casing (From museum of political history of Russia)]]
'''''Magnitizdat''''' ({{lang-rus|магнитизда́т|p=məɡnʲɪtʲɪzˈdat}}, from the Russian words for "tape recorder" магнитофо́н {{IPA|[məɡnʲɪtɐˈfon]}}, and "publishing" изда́тельство {{IPA|[ɪˈzdatʲɪlʲstvə]}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Garey|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the process of re-copying and self-distributing live [[Magnetic tape sound recording|audio tape]] recordings in the [[Soviet Union]] that were not available commercially. It is similar to [[bootleg recording]]s, except it was often sanctioned by the performers (who did not expect to make money from these recordings anyway) for the purpose of circumventing [[Censorship in the Soviet Union|Soviet political censorship]] and making their work as well known as possible.

The process of ''magnitizdat'' was less risky than publishing literature via [[samizdat]], since any person in the USSR was permitted to own a private [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|reel-to-reel]] tape recorder, while paper duplication equipment was under control of the state.

''Magnitizdat'' was the main method by which the songs of [[Bard (Soviet Union)|Russian bards]] such as [[Bulat Okudzhava]], [[Vladimir Vysotsky]] and [[Alexander Galich (writer)|Alexander Galich]] or [[punk bands]] like [[Grazhdanskaya Oborona]] made their way around the Soviet Union and abroad. Magnitizdat was also used to distribute lectures with anti-Soviet content.

[[File:MotionGraphicsAnimation.webm|thumb|Animation in and about motion graphics. In Spanish, with English subtitles]]

'''Motion graphics''' are pieces of digital [[footage]] or [[animation]] which create the [[illusion]] of [[Motion (physics)|motion]] or rotation, and are usually combined with [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] for use in [[multimedia]] projects. Motion graphics are usually displayed via [[electronic media]] technology, but may also be displayed via manual powered technology (e.g. [[thaumatrope]], [[phenakistoscope]], [[stroboscope]], [[zoetrope]], [[praxinoscope]],  [[flip book]]). The term distinguishes still graphics from those with a transforming appearance over time, without over-specifying the form.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Betancourt, The Origins of Motion Graphics, Cinegraphic, January 6, 2012 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20130306203217744]&lt;/ref&gt; While any form of experimental or abstract animation can be called motion graphics, the term typically more explicitly refers to the commercial application of animation and effects to video, film, TV, and interactive applications.

==Scope of the term==
'''Motion graphics''' extend beyond the most commonly used methods of frame-by-frame footage and animation. Motion graphics can be distinguished from typical animation in that they are not strictly character driven or story based and often represent animated abstract shapes and forms such as logos or logo elements.

==History of the term==
[[File:Alebrijes wikilearning.webm|thumb|Motion graphic clip about [[alebrije]]s created by the [[Museo de Arte Popular]] in Mexico City. Note: Click the CC button for English subtitles.]]
Since there is no universally accepted definition of motion graphics, the official beginning of the art form is disputed. There have been presentations that could be classified as motion graphics as early as the 1800s. [[Michael Betancourt]] wrote the first in depth historical survey of the field, arguing for its foundations in [[visual music]] and the historical abstract films of the 1920s by [[Walther Ruttmann]], [[Hans Richter (artist)|Hans Richter]], [[Viking Eggeling]] and [[Oskar Fischinger]].&lt;ref&gt;Justin Cone, The History of Motion Graphics, Motionographer.com, February 12, 2013 [http://motionographer.com/2013/02/12/the-history-of-motion-graphics/]&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of motion graphics is closely related to the history of [[Computer Graphics]] as the new developments of computer generated graphics led to a wider use of motion design not based on optical film animation. The term motion graphics originated with digital [[video editing]] in computing, perhaps to keep pace with newer technology. Graphics for television were originally referred to as Broadcast Design.

One of the first uses of the term "motion graphics" was by animator [[John Whitney (animator)|John Whitney]], who in 1960 founded a company called Motion Graphics Inc.&lt;ref name="cmu.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ph/nyit/masson/history.htm|title="The Computer Graphics Book Of Knowledge"|author=|date=|website=www.cs.cmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Saul Bass]] is a major pioneer in the development of feature film title sequences.  His work included title sequences for popular films such as ''[[The Man with the Golden Arm]]'' (1955), ''[[Vertigo (film)|Vertigo]]'' (1958), ''Anatomy of a Murder'' (1959), ''North by Northwest'' (1959), ''Psycho'' (1960), and ''Advise &amp;amp; Consent'' (1962).  His designs were simple, but effectively communicated the mood of the film.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Betancourt, Saul Bass – Animating Modernist Design, Cinegraphic, August 28, 2011 [http://www.cinegraphic.net/article.php?story=20110826144209282]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Computer-generated motion graphics==
Before computers were widely available, motion graphics were costly and time-consuming, limiting their use to high-budget [[filmmaking]] and [[television production]]. Computers began to be used as early as the late 1960s as super computers were capable of rendering crude graphics. John Whitney and [[Charles Csuri]] can be considered early pioneers of computer aided animation.&lt;ref&gt;http://excelsior.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~carlson/history/ID797.html&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOwyRnZ1oxoC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=cranston/csuri+productions&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JOjDVJHoAarnsAT9rILwCA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cranston/csuri+productions&amp;f=false|title=Moving Innovation: A History of Computer Animation|first=Tom|last=Sito|date=8 June 2018|publisher=MIT Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1980s to mid-1990s, expensive proprietary graphics systems such as those from British-based [[Quantel]] were quite commonplace in many [[television station]]s. Quantel workstations such as the Hal, Henry, Harry, Mirage and Paintbox were the broadcast graphics standard of the time. Many other real time graphics systems were used such as Ampex ADO, Abekas and K-Scope for live [[Digital video effect]]s. Early proprietary 3D computer systems were also developed specifically for broadcast design such as the Bosch FGS-4000 which was used in the music video for Dire Straits [[Money for Nothing (song)]]. The advent of more powerful desktop computers running Photoshop in the mid-90s drastically lowered the costs for producing digital graphics.  With the reduced cost of producing motion graphics on a computer, the discipline has seen more widespread use. With the availability of desktop programs such as Adobe [[After Effects]], [[Combustion (software)|Discreet Combustion]], and [[Apple Motion]], motion graphics have become increasingly accessible.  Modern [[character generator]]s (CG) from [[Aston Broadcast Systems]] and [[Chyron Corporation]]'s incorporate motion graphics.

The term "motion graphics" was popularized by Trish and Chris Meyer's book about the use of Adobe [[After Effects]], titled ''Creating Motion Graphics''.  This was the beginning of desktop applications which specialized in video production, but were not editing or 3D programs.  These new programs collected together [[special effects]], [[compositing]], and color correction toolsets, and primarily came between edit and 3D in the production process. This "in-between" notion of motion graphics and the resulting style of animation is why sometimes it is referred to as [[2.5D]].

Motion graphics continue to evolve as an art form with the incorporation of sweeping camera paths and 3D elements. Maxon's [[CINEMA 4D]], plugins such as [[CINEMA 4D|MoGraph]] and Adobe [[After Effects]]. Despite their relative complexity, [[Autodesk]]'s [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and [[3D Studio Max]] are widely used for the animation and design of motion graphics, as is [[Maya (software)|Maya]] and 3D Studio which uses a [[node-based]] [[particle system]] generator similar to [[Cinema 4D]]'s Thinking Particles plugin. There are also some other packages in Open Source panorama, which are gaining more features and adepts in order to use in a motion graphics workflow, while [[Blender (software)|Blender]] integrates several of the functions of its commercial counterparts.

Many motion graphics animators learn several [[3D graphics]] packages for use according to each program's strengths. Although many trends in motion graphics tend to be based on a specific software's capabilities, the software is only a tool the [[broadcast designer]] uses while bringing the vision to life.

Leaning heavily from techniques such as the [[collage]] or the [[pastiche]], motion graphics has begun to integrate many traditional animation techniques as well, including [[stop-motion animation]], [[cel animation]] or a combination of both.

==Particle system==
One of the most popular motion graphics tools is a [[particle system]]: a motion graphics technology that is used for generating multiple animated elements. This type of animation is commonly referred to as procedural animation. A particle system is available as a plug-in, as a stand-alone application, or is included as an integrated part of a motion graphics package. Particles are points in 3-D or 2-D space that can be represented by a wide variety of station and animated objects such as a ball of light, a video clip, or a selection of text, to name a few. The particles are generated by a particle emitter and can be emitted in small numbers or in the thousands, depending on the project. Among other things, a particle emitter can be in the form of a single point, a line, a grid, a plane or an object such as a box or sphere, although it can also make use a custom object to serve an emitter, such as a logo, which for example, can be exploded, melted, or transformed into blowing sand. A popular particle system for motion graphics is Particular by [[Trapcode]].

Other examples of individual particles include a blurred sphere that can be used in large numbers to create smoke or fog and a video clip of a person who can be duplicated to create a crowd scene. Particles can be emitted as a single item, although it is typically used in large numbers, such as when creating smoke or rain. They are controlled by directional forces, simulated wind and gravity, objects designed to attract or repel them. Other controllable attributes can include such things as changes in color, size, or transparency. Depending on the system, one can also combine multiple simultaneous emitters, such as when simulating an explosion that combines fire, smoke and flying debris. In an advanced 3-D system the particle can be used to control an animated articulated character, a recognizable example being the warriors in the battle sequences of the film Lord of the Rings.

==Animation==
Elements of a motion graphics project can be animated by various means, depending on the capabilities of the software. These elements may be in the form of art, text, photos, and video clips, to name a few. The most popular form of animation is [[keyframing]], in which properties of an object can be specified at certain points in time by setting a series of keyframes so that the properties of the object can be automatically altered (or [[Tweening|tweened]]) in the frames between keyframes. Another method involves a behavior system such as is found in [[Apple Motion]] that controls these changes by simulating natural forces without requiring the more rigid but precise keyframing method. Yet another method involves the use of formulas or scripts, such as the expressions function in [[Adobe After Effects]] or the creation of [[ActionScript]]s within [[Adobe Flash]]. Computers are capable of calculating and randomizing changes in imagery to create the illusion of motion and transformation. [[Computer animation]]s can use less information space ([[computer memory]]) by automatically [[tweening]], a process of [[Rendering (computer graphics)|render]]ing the key changes of an image at a specified or calculated time. These key poses or frames are commonly referred to as keyframes or low CP. [[Adobe Flash]] uses computer animation tweening as well as '''frame-by-frame''' animation and video.
[[Stop motion]] graphics is the oldest type of motion graphics which has given birth to cinemas&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animate2explain.com/explainer-videos/motion-graphics-videos/&lt;/ref&gt;, it provides unique effect to the videos.

== Motion design and digital compositing software packages ==
{{Main article|Motion graphic design}}
Since motion design is created using images and video sequences, a complementary tool is a 3d software package. [[Maya (software)|Maya]] has new MASH module specially design for motion graphics with lots of nodes for complex but interactive animations and seamlessly exports camera, objects to Adobe After Effects.  [[Cinema 4D]] is widely used for its intuitive interface, layered export to Adobe After Effects, and the additional MoGraph module, but there are other software packages as well. Such packages can generate images or video sequences with an [[alpha channel]], which stores all the transparency information.

Motion design applications include [[Adobe After Effects]], [[Eyeon Fusion]], [[Nuke (software)|Nuke]], [[Autodesk Combustion]], [[Apple Motion]], [[Max/MSP]], various [[VJ (video performance artist)|VJ]] Programs, Smith Micro Software [[Anime Studio]], [[Adobe Flash]], Natron and [[Synfig|Synfig Studio]]. 3D programs used in motion graphics include Maxon [[Cinema 4D]], Autodesk [[3ds Max]] and [[Maya (software)|Maya]], NewTek [[Lightwave]], e-on [[Vue Infinite]] and [[Blender (software)|Blender]]. Motion graphics plug-ins include [[Magic bullet (software)|Magic Bullet]], [[Red Giant Software]] and [[The Foundry Visionmongers]].

'''NanoArt''' is a novel [[art]] discipline related to [[science]] and [[technology]]. It depicts natural or synthetic structures with features sized at the [[nanometer]] scale, which are observed by [[electron microscopy|electron]] or [[scanning probe microscopy]] techniques in scientific laboratories. The recorded two or three dimensional images and movies are processed for artistic appeal and presented to the general audience.

One of the aims of NanoArt is to familiarize people with [[nanoscale]] objects and advances in their synthesis and manipulation. NanoArt has been presented at traditional art exhibitions around the world. Besides, online competitions have been launched in the 2000s such as the “NANO” 2003 show at [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and “Nanomandala”, the 2004 and 2005 installations in New York and Rome by [[Victoria Vesna]] and [[James Gimzewski]],&lt;ref name="r5"&gt;{{cite web|title= At the intersection of art and science: NANO|work= Los Angeles County Museum of Art|url=http://www.nisenet.org/catalog/exhibits/nano_-_los_angeles_county_museum_art_exhbition|author1=Vesna, V.  |author2=Gimzewski, J.  |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the regular "Science as Art" section launched at the 2006 Materials Research Society Meeting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrs.org/science-as-art/ Science as Art]. mrs.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomczyk2014"&gt;{{cite book| last=Tomczyk | first=Michael | title=NanoInnovation: What Every Manager Needs to Know|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xtGRBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA115|date= 2014|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-3-527-32672-3|pages=115–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A characteristic example of nanoart is ''[[A Boy and His Atom]]'', a one-minute [[stop-motion animation|stop-motion animated]] film created in 2012 by [[IBM Research]] from 242 images sized by 45×25&amp;nbsp;nm, which were recorded with a [[scanning tunneling microscope]]. The movie tells the story of a boy and a wayward atom who meet and become friends. The film was accepted into the Tribeca Online Film Festival and shown at the New York Tech Meet-up and the World Science Festival.

Earlier in 2007 a book ''[[Teeny Ted from Turnip Town]]'' was created at the [[Simon Fraser University]] in Canada using a [[gallium]]-ion beam with a diameter of ~7 nanometers. The book contains 30 [[silicon]]-based pages sized by 0.07×0.10&amp;nbsp;mm; it was published in 100 copies and has an [[ISBN]] number.

In 2015, [[Jonty Hurwitz]] pioneered a new technique for creating nanosculpture using [[multiphoton lithography]] and [[photogrammetry]]. His work ''Trust'' was prepared in collaboration with [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] and set a [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] as the "Smallest Sculpture of a Human Form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/adma.201502382 |author1=Yetisen, A.

'''Nepalese Painting''' marks the beginning with the religious paintings of Hindu and Buddhist culture. Those traditional paintings can be found in the form of either wall paintings, cloth paintings or manuscripts. They used conservative technique, style, and iconography in their works for centuries.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Kathryn Selig|title=Nepalese Painting|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nepp/hd_nepp.htm|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Nepalese paintings believed to have embraced western influences after 1850 with a work of Bhajuman [Chitrakar], a traditional artist who became acquainted with western Realism after visiting Europe. Bhajuman, also known as Bhajumacha Chitrakar, was a court painter of [[Jung Bahadur Rana]], who visited Europe in 1850 after becoming Prime Minister of Nepal. As a member of the new Prime Minister's entourage, Bhajuman also visited Paris and London. Soon after the return, western Realism supposedly influenced Bhajuman's paintings, marking the start of modern trend. An unsigned painting - supposedly to have painted by Bhajuman - depicts a Thapa General in a full military regalia.&lt;ref&gt;Tej Bahadur Chitrakar icon of transition by Madan Chitrakar 2004&lt;/ref&gt; This painting remained a pivotal example of considerable departure from an established traditional school of Nepali painting to western school of art practice. However, the recent discovery of the illustrations by [[Raj Man Singh Chitrakar]] (1797-1865) for his patron a British Resident [[Brian Houghton Hodgson]], sheds light on the western Realism entering Nepal way before the influences brought in by Bhajuman Chitrakar.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhm.ac.uk/nature-online/art-nature-imaging/collections/art-themes/india/more/owl_more_info.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==7th to 19th century paintings of Nepal==

[[Madhubani - Mithila Painting|Mithila Painting]] is practiced in the [[Mithila (region)|Mithila region]] of [[Nepal]] and [[India]]. This tradition dates back to the 7th century AD. Mithila painting is done with twigs, fingers, natural dyes and pigments. Artists make pictures of natural objects like sun, moon, and deities from mythological epics, royal courts, and weddings.&lt;ref name="madhu"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mathew|first1=Soumya|title=Madhubani art: Why painting is integral to women’s existence|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/lifestyle/art-and-culture/madhubani-art-why-painting-is-integral-to-womens-existence-4707034/|accessdate=19 November 2017|publisher=Indianexpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have discovered much Buddhist art in caves of [[Mustang]] area which dates back to 12 century or earlier. &lt;ref name="NG"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mehta|first1=Aalok|title=Photo in the News: "Stunning" Buddha Art Found in Nepal Cliff|url=https://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/05/070507-buddha-pictures.html|accessdate=19 November 2017|publisher=Nationalgeographic.com|date=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Style, technique, materials and subject of painting differed with the ethnic origin of the artists. Artists from the Newar community made most of the paintings that illuminated Buddhist manuscripts and book covers as well as devotional paintings on cloth. Newari artists were renowned throughout Asia for the high quality of their workmanship.&lt;ref name="Met"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brown|first1=Kathryn Selig|title=Nepalese Painting|url=https://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/nepp/hd_nepp.htm|publisher=[[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]]|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newari painting style 'Beri' was famous in Tibet. Beri was adopted as Tibet’s universal painting style in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="RUBI"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=David|title=THE NEPALESE LEGACY IN TIBETAN PAINTING|url=http://rubinmuseum.org/events/exhibitions/the-nepalese-legacy-in-tibetan-painting|website=rubinmuseum.org|accessdate=19 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nepalese Painting 1900-1950==
The remarkable entry of the western school of art practice is noticed in Nepali painting only after the return of two young artists [[Tej Bahadur Chitrakar]] 1898-1971 and Chandra Man Singh Maskey in late 1920s. They both joined Government School of Art in Calcutta to learn to paint by observing life and nature-concept of tonal effects, colors and the most important - the application and the use of modern paint mediums like oil, water, charcoal, pastel etc.&lt;ref&gt;Tej Bahadur Chitrakar icon of transition by Mkadan Chitrakar 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Very few works of Chandra Man Singh Maskey are accessible to the public. However with the publication of the book Tej Bahadur Chitrakar - icon of transition written by his heir Madan Chitrakar in 2004 and a grand post-humous retrospective of Tej Bahadur Chitrakar "Images of a Lifetime--: A Historical Perspective" organised by Siddhartha Art Gallery in 2005&lt;ref&gt;''Images of a Lifetime--: A Historical Perspective'', 20 November-5 December 2005, Siddhartha Art Gallery, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; have emphasised on his contribution for the development of Nepali painting. Tej Bahadur Chitrakar played an important role practising in both traditional Nepali art as well as western ways of painting. Simultaneously he is also fondly remembered as a dedicated teacher who shared his knowledge to many aspiring artists of his time. Under the tutelage of Tej Bahadur, Dil Bahadur Chitrakar versed himself in various paint mediums especially pastel techniques whilst Amar Chitrakar became an expert in water color and oil and became one of the beloved Nepali artists.

==Nepalese Painting 1950-1990==
The arrival of [[Lain Singh Bangdel]] (1919–2002) in 1961 marks as an introduction to Modern Art in Nepal. He brought with him, the exposure to Modern art movements from Paris to a country which was slowly opening to the world only after 1950s. With the patronage of King Mahendra, Lain Singh Bangdel introduced abstract art to the Nepali audience. In 1972 he was appointed as an academician of Royal Nepal Academy by King Birendra.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lain Singh Bangdel]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Juddha Kala Pathshala was the only institute&lt;ref&gt;http://artnepal.net/lalitkala&lt;/ref&gt; where art was taught formally during those days. Many of the young enthusiasts opted India to study art under various scholarship programs. After the return of young artists such as Uttam Nepali, Manuj Babu Mishra, Shashi Bikram Shah, Batsa Gopal Baidhya, Krishna Manandhar, Rama Nanda Joshi, [[Thakur Prasad Mainali]], Deepak Shimkhada, [[Sushma Shimkhada]], Pramila Giri, Indra Pradhan, Karna Narsingh Rana, K.K. Karmacharya, Shashi Kala Tiwari, Nepali art flourished into a collective modern phase. Artists like Kiran Manandhar, Karna Maskey, Ragini Upadhyay, Uma Shankar Shah, Pramesh Adhikari, Yuwak Tuladhar,  Birendra Pratap Singh, Surendra Bhattarai, Sharad Ranjit succeeded as a young and vibrant generation during 1980s. K.K.Karmacharya had more worked to stretch out as new technique, collage and assemblage cf popular in Europe, in Nepal. Durga Baral practising in isolation in his home town Pokhara&lt;ref&gt;http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=1891&lt;/ref&gt; came as a surprise with his first solo exhibition in 1983 "Chowk ra Tamsuk". Though a self practised artist, his mastery in skill and execution surpassed many of his contemporaries. Karna Maskey passed away on September 14, 2016

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14125">'''New adult''' ('''NA''') '''fiction''', also rendered as '''new-adult fiction''', is a developing genre of fiction with protagonists in the 18–30 age bracket.&lt;ref&gt;Beckett, Sandra L. (2008). Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives. pp. 111, 119–126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[St. Martin's Press]] first coined the term in 2009, when they held a special call for "...fiction similar to YA that can be published and marketed as adult—a sort of an 'older YA' or 'new adult'".&lt;ref name="GC1"&gt;{{cite web|title=St. Martin's New Adult Contest|url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/st-martins-new-adult-contest|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; New adult fiction tends to focus on issues such as leaving home, developing sexuality, and negotiating education and career choices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Would you read novels aimed at 'new adults'?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/sep/10/new-adult-fiction|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=19 May 2013|location=London|first=Briony|last=Chappell|date=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre has gained popularity rapidly over the last few years, particularly through books by self-published bestselling authors like Jennifer L. Armentrout, Cora Carmack, [[Colleen Hoover]], and Jamie McGuire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=19 May 2013|first1=Deirdre|last1=Donahue|date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Karl Alexander Interview Part 3|url=http://www.fearnet.com/news/interview/karl-alexander-interview-part-3|publisher=FearNet|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre was originally faced criticism, as some viewed it as a marketing scheme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' Fiction Is Now an Official Literary Genre Because Marketers Want Us to Buy Things|url=http://jezebel.com/5960942/new-adult-fiction-is-now-an-official-literary-genre-because-marketers-want-you-to-buy-things|publisher=Jezebel|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others claimed the readership was not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, others claimed that the term was necessary; a publicist for [[HarperCollins]] described it as "a convenient label because it allows parents and bookstores and interested readers to know what is inside".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond Wizards and Vampires, to Sex|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=1&amp;|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=19 May 2013|first=Leslie|last=Kaufman|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of books in the new adult genre include Sarah J. Maas' ''A Court of Thorns and Roses'' and ''Throne of Glass'', Jennifer L. Armentrout's ''Wait For You'', Jamie McGuire's ''Beautiful Disaster'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='New Adult' books growing up|url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/article/20130420/THINGSTODO07/304200030/-New-Adult-books-growing-up|publisher=Lansing State Journal|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colleen Hoover's ''Slammed'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut Fiction on Bestseller Lists|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587#.UZhSmKLFVqw|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cora Carmack's ''Losing It'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are your teens ready for New Adult fiction?|url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/17501716-423/are-your-teens-ready-for-new-adult-fiction.html|publisher=Sun Times|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kendall Ryan (novelist)|Kendall Ryan]]'s ''The Impact of You''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2013/06/09/kendall-ryan-the-impact-of-you-new-adult/|title=Sexy-romance author Kendall Ryan gives New Adult a try|date=2013-06-09|website=Happy Ever After|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marketing==
This category is intended to be marketed to [[Adolescence|post-adolescents]] and [[Young adult (psychology)|young-adults]] ages 18 to 30. This age group is considered to be the lucrative "cross-over" category of young-adult titles that appeal to both the young-adult market and to an adult audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beckett, Sandra L. |title=Crossover Fiction: Global and Historical Perspectives|pages= 111, 119–126|date= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers of young-adult fiction now favor this category as it encompasses a far broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sjaejones.com/blog/2009/postadolescent-or-new-adult-fiction/ |title=Postadolescent or 'New Adult' Fiction |author= JJ |date=10 November 2009 |work= Publishing, Reviews |accessdate=15 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief features that distinguish the new-adult fiction category from [[young adult fiction]] are the perspective of the young protagonist and the scope of the protagonist's life experience. Perspective is gained as childhood innocence fades and life experience is gained, which brings insight. It is this insight which is lacking in traditional young-adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/09/books/survey-shows-publishing-expanded-since-2008.html |title=Publishing Gives Hints of Revival, Data Show |first=Julie |last=Bosman |date= August 9, 2011 |accessdate=15 September 2012 |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other main differences are characters' ages and the settings. YA does not usually include characters over age 18 or in college, but these characters are featured in new adult books. New adult can best be described as the age category after young adult.

==Themes and issues==
New adult literature touches upon many themes and issues to reach the readership that falls in between the categories of young adult and adult fiction.

Many themes covered in young adult fiction such as identity, sexuality, depression, suicide, drug abuse, alcohol abuse, familial struggles, bullying&lt;ref&gt;[[young adult fiction]]&lt;/ref&gt; are also covered in new adult fiction, but the various issues that are dealt with in the category hold it separate. Some common examples of issues include first jobs, starting college, wedding engagements and marriage, starting new families, friendships post-high school, military enlistment, financial independence, living away from home for the first time, empowerment, loss of innocence, and fear of failure.

This category focuses heavily on life after an individual has become of legal age, and how one deals with the new beginnings of adulthood. Commonly, these themes and issues have been seen taking place post-high school in popular new adult fiction titles, but there are exceptions.

==Genre==
Like the fiction categories of young adult and adult, new adult fiction can combine with all genres and subgenres. [[Science fiction]], [[urban fiction]], [[Horror fiction|horror]], [[Paranormal fiction|paranormal]], [[dystopia]], etc. are some examples.

==Controversies==

===Publishing industry===
Many agents and large publishing houses have yet to recognize the category due to various issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishingcrawl.com/2013/01/30/new-adult-passing-trend-or-legitimate-genre/|title=New Adult- Passing Trend or Legitimate Genre?|date=30 January 2013|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some view the category as a marketing scheme, while others claim the readership is not there to publish the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/industry-news/publishing-and-marketing/article/55164-new-adult-needless-marketing-speak-or-valued-subgenre.html|title=New Adult: Needless Marketing-Speak Or Valued Subgenre?|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, authors have turned to self-publishing as a means to get their books out into the market.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/books/2013/04/15/new-adult-genre-is-the-hottest-category-in-book-publishing/2022707/ | work=USA Today | first1=Deirdre | last1=Donahue | title=New Adult fiction is the hot new category in books | date=15 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these authors has led to many independent publishing houses and agents opening up to the category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.org/2012/11/29/with-new-digital-imprints-random-house-taps-self-published-authors/|title=With new digital imprints, Random House taps self-published authors|first=Laura|last=Owen|date=29 November 2012|website=paidcontent.org|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publishers are now publishing these books with many of the bestsellers having deals with large publishers.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;

===Sex===
In 2012, new adult fiction saw a rise in the romance subgenre of contemporary when self-published titles such as ''Slammed'' by [[Colleen Hoover]], ''Easy'' by Tamarra Webber, and ''[[Beautiful Disaster (novel)|Beautiful Disaster]]'' by [[Jamie McGuire (author)|Jamie McGuire]] got picked up by major publishing houses. Some believe&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/22/books/young-adult-authors-add-steaminess-to-their-tales.html?_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Leslie | last=Kaufman | title=Young-Adult Authors Are Creating a Steamy New Genre | date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; this jump in response to the category came from the release of the popular erotic novel ''[[Fifty Shades of Grey]]'', which featured a heroine in college.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Since new adult fiction tackles issues such as sex and sexuality and many of the categories' successful titles deal with those same issues the category itself and the single issue of sex have been stated as synonymous,&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; and even been called over-sexualized versions of young adult fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/emerging-adult-book-genre-puts-smut-fiction-bestseller/story?id=18550587|title=Emerging 'New Adult' Book Genre Puts Smut on Top|first=A. B. C.|last=News|date=23 February 2013|website=ABC News|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both readers and authors of the category combat the claim by stating that the category deals with the exploration of a character's life,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dearauthor.com/features/letters-of-opinion/new-adult-its-not-about-the-sex-but-dont-be-afraid-of-the-sex-either/|title=New Adult: It’s not about the sex (but don’t be afraid of the sex either)|date=25 December 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that sex is not ubiquitous in new adult titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ebscohost.com/novelist/novelist-special/what-is-new-adult-fiction-anyway|title=What is New Adult Fiction, Anyway? - NoveList - EBSCOhost|website=www.ebscohost.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2009 to present==
Following the end of the St. Martin's Press contest, the new adult category has become increasingly popular through self-publishing.  Major New York publishers are taking self-published authors of these titles and acquiring them for mass market sales.  Some authors include:

'''''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy''''' (or ''The Ecstasy of Saint Francis'') is a painting by the Italian Baroque master [[Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio]]. It is held in the [[Wadsworth Atheneum|Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060515062933/http://www.wadsworthatheneum.org/view/european-paint-sculpture.php?art_work_index=9 Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy - Notes at Wadsworth Atheneum website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was the first of Caravaggio's religious canvasses, and is thought to date from 1595, when he had recently entered the household of [[Cardinal Francesco Maria Del Monte]]. It was presumably painted at the behest of Del Monte, and is thought to be one of the first paintings done by the artist as "Del Monte's painter", as he is believed to have described himself over the next few years while living in [[Palazzo Madama]]. It shows [[Saint Francis of Assisi]] (the Cardinal's name-saint) at the moment of receiving the signs of the [[Stigmata]], the wounds left in Christ's body by the Crucifixion. The story is told by one of Francis' companions, [[Brother Leo]]. In 1224 Francis retired to the wilderness with a small number of his followers  to contemplate God. On the mountainside at night Brother Leo saw a six-winged [[seraph]] (one of the higher Orders of angels) come down to Francis in answer to the saint's prayer that he might know both Christ's suffering and His love:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;All of a sudden there was a dazzling light. It was as though the heavens were exploding and splashing forth all their glory in millions of waterfalls of colours and stars. And in the centre of that bright whirlpool was a core of blinding light that flashed down from the depths of the sky with terrifying speed until suddenly it stopped, motionless and sacred, above a pointed rock in front of Francis. It was a fiery figure with wings, nailed to a cross of fire. Two flaming wings rose straight upward, two others opened out horizontally, and two more covered the figure. And the wounds in the hands and feet and heart were blazing rays of blood. The sparkling features of the Being wore an expression of supernatural beauty and grief. It was the face of Jesus, and Jesus spoke. Then suddenly streams of fire and blood shot from His wounds and pierced the hands and feet of Francis with nails and his heart with the stab of a lance. As Francis uttered a mighty shout of joy and pain, the fiery image impressed itself into his body, as into a mirrored reflection of itself, with all its love, its beauty, and its grief. And it vanished within him. Another cry pierced the air. Then, with nails and wounds through his body, and with his soul and spirit aflame, Francis sank down, unconscious, in his blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/stfrancis/stf_stigmata_of_st_francis_articles.htm St. Francis Receives the Stigmata - Brother Leo's account] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20061020184834/http://www.franciscanfriarstor.com/stfrancis/stf_stigmata_of_st_francis_articles.htm |date=2006-10-20 }}

[[Image:Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio - St. Francis in Ecstasy (detail) - WGA04080.jpg|thumb|200px|left|''Saint Francis of Assisi in Ecstasy'' (detail).]]Caravaggio's painting is less dramatic than the account given by Leo - the six-winged seraph is replaced by a two-winged [[angel]], and there is none of the violent confrontation described by Leo - no streams of fire, no pools of blood, no shouts or fiery images of Christ. Just the gentle-seeming angel, bulking far larger than the unconscious saint, and Francis' companions in the middle distance, almost invisible in the darkness.

The subject had been a popular one ever since the 13th century: [[Giotto]] treated it about 1290, and [[Giovanni Bellini]] painted a famous version about 1480-85. Caravaggio's version is much more intimate and marks a sharp change of key: the saint, who has the features of Del Monte, seems to sink back peacefully into the arms of a boy (who bears a marked resemblance to the boy in ''[[Boy Peeling a Fruit]]'' and to the winged Cupid on the far left of ''[[The Musicians (Caravaggio)|The Musicians]]'', and even more to the boy being cheated in ''[[Cardsharps]]'') wearing a sheet and some stage-prop wings. There is very little to indicate the subject beyond the saint's Franciscan robe - no sign of the Stigmata, or blood, except the wound in his heart, nor of the fearsome seraph. Yet the atmosphere remains genuinely spiritual, the two figures lit by an unearthly effulgence in the dark night-time landscape where strange glimmerings flicker on the horizon. The scene is at once real and unreal. Del Monte kept it till the end of his life, and several copies went into circulation and were greatly valued.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3051">The '''Society of Gilders''' (SoG) is an international [[non-profit organization]] dedicated to the practice and preservation of the art of using [[gold]] and [[metal leaf]]. SoG offers technical help for gilders, restorers, conservators, craftsmen, and all those interested in the [[gilding]] arts. Classes and conferences held by SoG bring gilders together from around the globe to learn, discuss and share.

Membership is open to any interested individual, institution or corporation.

==Mission==
The Society of Gilders is a non-profit [[educational organization]] devoted to the art and craft of gilding. The society's mission is to preserve traditional gilding skills and techniques, and to promote the highest standards in the practice of gilding.

==History==
A landmark event in the world of gilding took place at the [[Newark Museum]] in [[New Jersey]] during the winter of 1986. While attending a week-long gilding course hosted by the museum’s Arts Workshop, gilders met and exchanged gilding recipes, anecdotes, techniques and ethical concerns. The participants expressed a unanimous desire to extend this collaboration into an organization patterned after the ancient craftsmen’s guilds. Originally called the Guild of Gilders, the group changed their name to the Society of Gilders, welcoming fellow gilders and anyone interested in the art of gilding to join their ranks.

Today the Society of Gilders continues to grow, and the Regional Education Program continues to teach the art of gilding in many disciplines. Conferences have been held in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]], [[South Carolina]] (2000), [[Washington DC]] (2001, 2003, 2006 and 2008), and [[New Orleans]], [[Louisiana]] (2007 to 2013).

==Museum of Gilding Arts==
The Society opened the Museum of Gilding Arts in [[Pontiac, Illinois]] in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Museum of the Gilding Arts to Open this Saturday in Pontiac, IL|url=http://www.rcreader.com/news-releases/the-museum-of-the-gilding-arts-to-open-this-saturday-in-pontiac-il/|publisher=River Cities Reader|accessdate=9 December 2015|date=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Displays include the history of gold beating, its use as a decorative element and a display of works of art by the Society's members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of the Gilding Arts|url=http://il-pontiactourism.civicplus.com/2190/Museum-of-the-Gilding-Arts|publisher=Visit Pontiac Illinois|accessdate=9 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a recreation of the M.

'''''Special Illumination: The Sufi Use Of Humour''''' is a book by the writer [[Idries Shah]] published [[Octagon Press]] in 1977. Later editions were published in 1983, 1989 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com page on Special Illumination: The Sufi Use Of Humour&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''Special Illumination'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Content==

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|left|100px|Idries Shah]]
''Special Illumination'' was the phrase used by Jalaludin [[Rumi]] to stress the importance of humour in relation to mystical experience; 'If you want special illumination look upon the human face: See clearly within laughter the Essence of Ultimate Truth.'

Presenting commentaries, stories and jokes, Shah writes; ‘Rumi directly contradicts such numerous sour-faced religionists as, in all persuasions, find that humour disturbs the indoctrination which is all that they usually have to offer.’

==Reception==

In the essay ''The Sufis and Idries Shah'', the [[Nobel Prize]]–winning novelist [[Doris Lessing]] writes that the book is about the Sufi use of humour, not an academic treatise, and takes the reader "through a sequence of tales, explaining possible meanings." She tells us that "Shah warns not to fall in love with the great classics of the past. 'People study Rumi and turn themselves into perfect replicas of 14th century people.' For classics to be of use, we need a Sufi to choose the parts that are still relevant, and put them into our context — to 'unlock' them."&lt;ref name="TimeBites"&gt;{{cite book

==Early life==
Brooks was born in the rural Midwestern town of [[Sterling, Illinois]], and spent a large part of his life living there.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.terrybrooks.net/bio.html |title=Terry Brooks' official biography |accessdate=2008-05-19 |last=Speakman |first=Shawn |authorlink= |year=2008 |publisher= }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is an alumnus of [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]], earning his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in English literature in 1966.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; He later obtained a law degree ([[Juris Doctor|J.D.]]) from [[Washington and Lee University]]. He was a practicing [[Lawyer|attorney]] before becoming a full-time author.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Terry Brooks by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|Brooks at a book signing at the 2017 [[Phoenix Comicon]]]]
Brooks had been a writer since high school, writing mainly in the genres of [[science fiction]], western, fiction, and [[Non-fiction writing|non-fiction]].&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; One day, in his early college life, he was given a copy of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', which inspired him to write in one genre.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; While Tolkien inspired the genre, Brooks stated during his TEDxRainier talk "Why I Write about Elves",&lt;ref name="Why I Write about Elves"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brooks|first1=Terry|title=Why I Write about Elves|url=http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|website=tedxtalks.ted.com|accessdate=December 14, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141019000949/http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/Why-I-Write-about-Elves-Terry-B|archivedate=October 19, 2014|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at the Charlotte Literary Festival that he credits the inspiration of his style of writing to [[William Faulkner]]'s works.&lt;ref name="Why I Write about Elves"/&gt; With this inspiration, he then made his debut in 1977 with ''[[The Sword of Shannara]]''.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt;

After finishing two sequels to ''The Sword of Shannara'', Brooks moved on to the series which would become known as the ''[[Magic Kingdom of Landover|Landover]]'' novels.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; Brooks then wrote a four-book series titled ''[[The Heritage of Shannara]]''.&lt;ref name="Terry Brooks' Bio"/&gt; For the next fourteen years, he wrote more ''Landover'' books, then went on to write ''The Word and Void'' trilogy.  Continuing the ''[[Shannara]]'' series, Brooks wrote the prequel to ''The Sword of Shannara'', titled ''[[First King of Shannara]]''.  He then wrote two series, ''[[The Voyage of the Jerle Shannara]]'' and ''[[High Druid of Shannara]]'' and recently finished a third, ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', a trilogy bridging his ''Word and Void'' and ''Shannara'' series.  The sixth book in the ''Landover'' series, ''[[A Princess of Landover]]'', was released in August 2009. 
Returning to Shannara, a duology, ''[[Legends of Shannara]]'', taking place after the events of ''[[Genesis of Shannara]]'', was written next. The first book, entitled ''[[Bearers of the Black Staff]]'', was released in August 2010 and the second, ''[[The Measure of the Magic]]'', was released in August 2011.
He next completed a trilogy entitled ''[[The Dark Legacy of Shannara]]''. The three books are; ''[[Wards of Faerie]]'' (Feb 2013), ''[[Bloodfire Quest]]'' (June 2013), and ''Witch Wraith'' (Dec 2013). He followed this with the trilogy ''Defenders of Shannara'', which include ''The High Druid's Blade'' (July 2014), ''The Darkling Child'' (June 2015), and ''The Sorcerer's Daughter'' (May 24, 2016).
According to his website, he is currently working on the final and concluding tetralogy of the Shannara series known as [[The Fall of Shannara]]. The first book in the tetralogy is [[The Black Elfstone]] and was released on June 13, 2017.

A television series based on the Shannara works, entitled ''[[The Shannara Chronicles]]'' began showing on MTV in January 2016. The show starts with the second book of the original series, ''Elfstones'', as there are strong female roles which did not appear in the first book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|title=Terry Brooks: MTV is Doing The Shannara Chronicles Right|author=|date=|website=pastemagazine.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828103526/https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/terry-brooks-mtv-is-doing-the-shannara-chronicles.html|archivedate=August 28, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second season aired in 2017 on SPIKE &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|title=MTV Renews The Shannara Chronicles For Second Season|author=|date=|website=mtv.com|accessdate=May 9, 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171106054106/http://www.mtv.com/news/2870369/shannara-chronicles-renewed/|archivedate=November 6, 2017|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, 2018, it was announced that the series had been cancelled after two seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Petski |first1=Denise |title=‘The Shannara Chronicles’ Canceled After Two Seasons |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117033103/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-canceled-after-two-seasons-spike-mtv-paramount-network-1202244383/ |archivedate=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Producers later announced that the series is being shopped to other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Andreeva |first1=Nellie |title=‘The Shannara Chronicles’ Shopped To Other Networks For Season 3 |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |website=Deadline |accessdate=January 17, 2018 |date=January 17, 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180117064831/http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-shannara-chronicles-shopped-other-networks-season-3-1202244442/ |archivedate=January 17, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Novels versus short stories==
After writing "[[Indomitable (short story)|Indomitable]]", a short story constituting an epilogue to ''[[The Wishsong of Shannara]]'', Terry Brooks declared:
{{quote|I find it much harder to write short stories than long fiction. I feel cramped by the lack of space and the dictates of the form. There is considerable difference in long and short fiction disciplines, and I am not good with the latter. I hope not to have to do many more of them, but you never know.

"'''Thanatopsis'''" is a poem by the American poet [[William Cullen Bryant]].  Meaning 'a consideration of death', the word is derived from the Greek 'thanatos' (death) and 'opsis' (view, sight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=Thanatopsis|title=Thanatopsis - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=Etymonline.com|accessdate=30 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Brooklyn Museum - William Cullen Bryant - Wyatt Eaton - overall.jpg|thumb|A painting of William Cullen Bryant from 1878]]
[[William Cullen Bryant]] was born in 1794 in [[Cummington, Massachusetts]]. Bryant grew up in a Puritan home with his father, Peter Bryant, a prominent doctor. William Cullen Bryant's early education came from his father.{{sfn|Trent|1920|p=258}} In his early life Bryant would spend a great deal of time in the woods surrounding his family's New England home, and read of the extensive personal library his father had.{{sfn|Haralson|2014|p=57}} Bryant's first published poem was "The Embargo; or, Sketches of the Times", a satirical work concerning [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Embargo Act of 1807]]. It was released in a Boston newspaper in 1808. In 1810 Bryant was forced to leave [[Williams College]] for lack of money. Instead of a formal education, he started [[Jurisprudence|studying law]], and began learning an eclectic mix of poetry, such as the works of as [[Isaac Watts]] and [[Henry Kirke White]], and verses like [[William Cowper]]'s "[[The Task (poem)|The Task]]" and [[Edmund Spenser]]'s "[[The Faerie Queene]]".{{sfn|Trent|1920|p=259}}

When and where Bryant wrote "Thanatopsis" is unclear, and Bryant himself could not remember when he wrote the verse.{{sfn|Phelps|1924|p=7}} According to [[Parke Godwin (journalist)|Parke Godwin]], Bryant's friend, Bryant wrote the poem when he was seventeen years old in mid-1811, just after he had left Williams College.{{sfn|Bigelow|1890|p=40}} In ''History of American Literature'', two dates are stated for the authoring of "Thanatopsis", 1811 and 1816.{{sfn|Phelps|1924|p=6}} Bryant's inspiration for "Thanatopsis" came after reading [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[Lyrical Ballads]]'',{{sfn|Trent|1917|p=262}} as well as [[Robert Blair (poet)|Robert Blair]]'s "[[The Grave (poem)|The Grave]]", [[Beilby Porteus]]'s "[[Death (poem)|Death]]" and Kirke White's "[[Time (poem)|Time]]".{{sfn|Trent|1917|p=263}} After Bryant had left Cummington to begin his law studies, his father discovered a manuscript in Bryant's desk drawer,{{sfn|Trent|1920|p=261}} that contained "Thanatopsis" and a fragment of a poem, which would be published under the title "The Fragment"&lt;ref&gt;"The Fragment" in North American Review, September 1817[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25121331] &lt;/ref&gt;, and later titled "An Inscription upon the Entrance to a Wood".{{sfn|Bigelow|1890|p=40}} He sent the two poems without his son's knowledge to the editors at the ''[[North American Review]]'', where they were published in September 1817.&lt;ref&gt;"Thanatopsis" in North American Review, September 1817[https://www.jstor.org/stable/25121330] &lt;/ref&gt;  {{sfn|Phelps|1924|p=7}}  The editors added an introduction to Thanatopsis in a completely different style.  The part written by the author begins with "Yet a few days,".  The author republished the poem in 1821 in a collection of works called ''Poems''.  He replaced the introductory section, made a few minor changes to the text and added more material after the original end of the poem, which was "and make their bed with thee!".  Below is the revised version of 1821 which was retained in all later publications of the poem:

==Thanatopsis==
&lt;poem&gt;
{{pad|1em}}To him who in the love of Nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings, with a mild
And healing sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,
And breathless darkness, and the narrow house,
Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;—
Go forth, under the open sky, and list
To Nature’s teachings, while from all around
Earth and her waters, and the depths of air—
Comes a still voice—
{{pad|9em}}Yet a few days, and thee
The all-beholding sun shall see no more
In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again,
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix for ever with the elements,
To be a brother to the insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.
{{pad|1em}}Yet not to thine eternal resting-place
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings,
The powerful of the earth—the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun,—the vales
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods—rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadows green; and, poured round all,
Old Ocean’s gray and melancholy waste,—
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death,
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom.—Take the wings
Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save his own dashings—yet the dead are there:
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep—the dead reign there alone.
So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw
In silence from the living, and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one as before will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,
The youth in life’s green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
The speechless babe, and the gray-headed man—
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,
By those, who in their turn shall follow them.
{{pad|1em}}So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, which moves
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
&lt;/poem&gt;

==Critical reception==
Due to the unusual quality of the verse and Bryant's age, [[Richard Henry Dana, Sr.]], then associate editor at the ''North American Review'', initially doubted its authenticity, saying to another editor, "No one, on this side of the Atlantic, is capable of writing such verses."

"Thanatopsis" remains a milestone in American literary history. ''Poems'' was considered by many to be the first major book of American poetry. Nevertheless, over five years, it earned Bryant only $14.92.&lt;ref&gt;Gioia, Dana. "Longfellow in the Aftermath of Modernism". ''The Columbia History of American Poetry'', edited by Jay Parini. Columbia University Press, 1993: 74–75. {{ISBN|0-231-07836-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poet and literary critic [[Thomas Holley Chivers]], who often accused other writers of stealing poems, said that the only thing Bryant "ever wrote that may be called ''Poetry'' is 'Thanatopsis,' which he stole ''line for line'' from the Spanish."&lt;ref&gt;Parks, Edd Winfield. ''Ante-Bellum Southern Literary Critics''. Athens, GA: University of Georgia Press, 1962: 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (novel)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' by [[Thomas Harris]], [[Clarice Starling]] reveals to [[Hannibal Lecter]] one detail of her father's last days in a hospital: an elderly neighbour reading to him the last lines of "Thanatopsis." In [[Sinclair Lewis]]' novel [[Main Street (novel)|Main Street]], the women's study club of Gopher Prairie is the Thanatopsis club.

The experimental band [[Thanatopsis (band)|Thanatopsis]] was named after this poem. The band's first album, ''Thanatopsis'', was also named after this poem. The electronic artist [[Daedelus]] named the last song on the album ''[[Exquisite Corpse (album)|Exquisite Corpse]]'' after the poem.

The Avant Garde film-maker [[Ed Emshwiller]]'s 1962 short film Thanatopsis was inspired by the poem. In the ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'' episode "Terminal", a portion of the poem is set to folk music and sung by writer/producer [[Dave Willis]].

In the 1942 film ''[[Grand Central Murder]]'', the private railway car where the showgirl is murdered is named Thanatopsis.

In [[T. Coraghessan Boyle|T.C. Boyle]]'s 1990 novel ''[[East Is East (novel)|East Is East]]'', the writer's colony on the fictitious Georgia sea island of Tupelo (near Darien) is called Thanatopsis House.  Each of the artists in the colony have their own private studio cabin to work in during the day.  Each studio cabin is named after a famous suicide (example: [[Hart Crane]]).

In [[August Wilson]]'s 2003 play ''[[Gem of the Ocean]]'', Solly offers the final nine lines of the poem ("So live . . . pleasant dreams") as a toast to send off Citizen Barlow to the city of bones. Eli joins Solly in the recitation, offering his own interpretation of the lines: "You die by how you live."

The [[Acacia Fraternity]] adopted the last stanza as their [[:File:Acacia_Fraternity_Code.jpg|code.]]

American progressive rock band [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]]' 2000 studio album ''[[Somewhere to Elsewhere]]'' features a song called ''The Coming Dawn (Thanatopsis)''. The lyrics are a reflection on a life at its end.

The [[Algonquin Round Table]] of the 1920s had its own poker club: the tongue-in-cheek-named Thanatopsis Literary and Inside Straight Club.

Cindy Williams reads from Thanatopsis in Andy Kaufman's ABC TV Special aired in 1979.

[[File:Frans Hals 013.jpg|thumb|''The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627'']]
'''''The Banquet of the Officers of the St George Militia Company in 1627''''' refers to a [[schutterstuk]] painted by [[Frans Hals]] for the St. George (or St. Joris) civic guard of [[Haarlem]], and today is considered one of the main attractions of the [[Frans Hals Museum]] there.

In this group, each man wears a sash belonging to the color of the "rot", in this painting all three are represented with their flag-bearers wearing the colours Orange, white or blue. These officers were selected by the council of Haarlem to serve for three years, and this group had just finished their tenure and celebrated their end of service with a portrait. The man with the orange sash holding a glass of wine sitting at the table on the left and looking at Captain [[Michiel de Wael]] with an empty glass, is Colonel [[Aart Jansz Druyvesteyn]], who heads the table.

The men featured are from left to right Lieutenant [[Cornelis Boudewijns]] (standing above Colonel Aernout Druyvesteyn), Captain [[Nicolaes Verbeek]], Flag bearer [[Boudewijn van Offenberg]], Lieutenant [[Jacob Pietersz Olycan]], Captain Michiel de Wael, and above him, standing, is Flag bearer [[Dirck Dicx]] looking down at Jacob Olycan. Just behind him in the background is the servant [[Arent Jacobsz Koets]], and below him, seated, is Lieutenant [[Frederik Coning]]. Behind the servant in the far right, is the flag bearer [[Jacob Cornelisz Schout]] who towers above the dwarf in the lower right, Captain [[Nicolaes le Febure]].

==St. Jorisdoelen==
[[File:Grote Houtstraat 142 Haarlem RM 19243.jpg|thumb|View of one of the halls of the St. Jorisdoelen]]
The painting previously hung with others in the old "St. Jorisdoelen" complex, known today as the [[Proveniershuis]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentenregister.cultureelerfgoed.nl/php/main.php?cAction=search&amp;cOffset=1&amp;cLimit=25&amp;oOrder=ASC&amp;cSubmit=1&amp;sCompMonNr=19243 report] on [[Rijksmonument]] number 19243&lt;/ref&gt;  The paintings by Hals and others hung in the main hall of the complex in the [[Grote Houtstraat]]. Today a [[hofje]] with the main hall used as a restaurant, the main buildings were used for years as an inn, where the schutterstukken were tourist attractions. Today all of the schutterstukken that once hung here have been transferred to the Frans Hals Museum.

'''''The Distaff Gospels (Les Evangiles des Quenouilles)''''' is an [[Old French]] fifteenth-century collection of popular beliefs held by [[Late Middle Ages|late medieval]] women, first published in 1480. It was edited by Fouquart de Cambray, Duval Antoine and Jean d'Arras and published at Bruges by [[Colard Mansion|Colart Mansion]]. The narrative takes place within the context of a gathering of women who meet with their [[Spindle (textiles)|spindle]]s and [[distaff]]s to spin. They discuss [[folk wisdom]] related to their domestic lives, including controlling errant husbands, predicting the gender of future offspring and curing common ailments.

'''''The Gate of Calais''''' or '''''O, the Roast Beef of Old England''''' is a 1748 painting by [[William Hogarth]], reproduced as a print from an [[engraving]] the next year. Hogarth produced the painting directly after his return from France, where he had been arrested as a spy while sketching in [[Calais]]. The scene depicts a side of beef being transported from the harbour to an English tavern in the port, while a group of undernourished, ragged French soldiers and a fat [[friar]] look on hungrily. Hogarth painted himself in the left corner with a "soldier's hand upon my shoulder."&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"&gt;[[#JBN1833|J. B. Nichols, 1833]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;hl=en p.63]-[https://books.google.com/books?id=2xIEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA64&amp;hl=en p.64] ''"I meant to display to my own countryman the striking difference of food, priests, soldiers, &amp;c. of two nations"'' ... ''"The melancholy and miserable Highlander, browzing on his scanty fare, consisting of a bit of bread and an onion, is intended for one of the many that fled this country after the rebellion in 1745."''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

In July 1748, Hogarth took a trip to Paris, taking advantage of the armistice which preceded the signing of the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]] in October that year. He travelled with some artist friends, including [[Thomas Hudson (painter)|Thomas Hudson]], [[Joseph Van Aken|Joseph]] and Alexander Van Aken, [[Francis Hayman]], and [[Henry Cheere]]. [[George Vertue]] reports that the group split up on the return journey, with Hogarth and Hayman making their way to Calais to catch the boat to England and the others continuing their tour to [[Flanders]] and [[the Netherlands]].

While waiting in Calais, Hogarth decided to sketch the gate of the port and drawbridge which were still adorned with the English arms&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; (Calais had been an English enclave until 1558 and still retained many English architectural features). His sketching of the fortifications aroused suspicion, and he was arrested and taken before the Governor. Most accounts relate that Hogarth showed his other sketches to his captors; and when it became clear that he was merely an artist, he was discharged into the parole of his landlord to await the changing of the wind and the boat to England.&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; [[Horace Walpole]] elaborates the account, reporting that Hogarth was forced to demonstrate his abilities by producing sketches and [[caricature]]s as demanded by the French, "particularly a scene of the shore, with an immense piece of beef landing for the Lion d'Argent, the English inn at Calais, and several hungry friars following it." At any rate, Hogarth was discharged and returned to England by the next boat.

==Painting==
According to Hogarth's autobiographical notes, he started on the painting as soon as he arrived home from Calais.&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; The painting was completed in short order, followed by an engraving early the next year.

The painting takes a viewpoint under an archway in the main outer wall of Calais. The scene within centres around a [[sirloin]] of beef destined for the English tavern, the ''Lion d'Argent'', carried by a chef who stands out in his bright white apron and cap. The French soldiers, dressed in rags and forced to eat their watery [[wikt:soupe-maigre|soupe maigre]], gather round licking their lips. Two soldiers in [[Clog (shoe)|sabots]] can be seen carrying a cauldron of the grey unappetising soup. The [[Franciscan]] friar who greedily rubs his finger in the fat of the beef joint, is thought to be based on Hogarth's friend John Pine.&lt;ref name=Hogarth&gt;{{cite web|title=The 'Tapestry Hangings of the House of Lords'|url=http://www.rmg.co.uk/researchers/collections/by-type/archive-and-library/item-of-the-month/previous/the-%27tapestry-hangings-of-the-house-of-lords%27|publisher=The National Maritime Museum|accessdate=8 December 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821013006/http://www.rmg.co.uk/researchers/collections/by-type/archive-and-library/item-of-the-month/previous/the-'tapestry-hangings-of-the-house-of-lords'|archivedate=21 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground, a [[Gàidhealtachd|Highlander]], an exile from the [[Jacobite rising of 1745]],&lt;ref name="JBBN63-64"/&gt; sits slumped against the wall, his strength sapped by the poor French fare – a raw onion and a crust of bread. Hogarth is seen sketching to the left in the background, but the tip of the [[halberd]] and hand of the soldier who will arrest him are just appearing round the corner behind him.

There are strong references to the celebration of [[Eucharist]] in the picture. Through the gates, under the sign of a [[dove]] (that of an inn) a [[Roman Catholic]] [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] is being celebrated. In the foreground, but still aligned with those in the background under the cross of the gate, the principal characters worship the beef. The man carrying it bows under the weight appearing to offer it up to the friar on partially bended knee. Above the scene in front of the gate, the dove of peace is replaced by a [[carrion]] bird, the [[crow]]. In the foreground fishwives superstitiously [[Jenny Haniver|worship the face of a ray]], and the Jacobite also clasps his hand together in prayer.

Hogarth's antipathy to the French had been apparent in his art since ''Noon'' in his ''[[Four Times of the Day]]'' series, painted in 1736. ''[[The March to Finchley]]'', which he painted in 1749/50, provides a companion theme to ''The Gate of Calais'': it depicts a fictional gathering of robust English guardsman who are to march north to defend London against the invasion of [[Charles Edward Stuart|Bonnie Prince Charlie]]'s Jacobites in 1745. Further anti-French sentiment is apparent in his two ''Invasion'' engravings, published in 1756, and in ''Beer Street'', where Rev. [[James Townley]]'s accompanying verses stress the superiority of the English. ''The Gate of Calais''{{'}} secondary title, ''O, the Roast Beef of Old England'', is a reference to the popular patriotic ballad '[[The Roast Beef of Old England]]' from [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The Grub-Street Opera]]'' (1731), which told of how the food "ennobled our brains and enriched our blood" and laughed at "all-vapouring France"".

The painting was bought by the [[James Caulfeild, 1st Earl of Charlemont|1st Earl of Charlemont]] sometime after the 1761 Society of Artists' Exhibition at which it was displayed, by which time England had been [[Seven Years' War|at war]] with France again for 5 years. Ian Pears believes that by showing ''The Gates of Calais'' at the exhibition (one of only three comic histories that he displayed),&lt;!--the others?--&gt; Hogarth was challenging the patriotic spirit of the British by asking them to pay as much for a work by an Englishman as they would for a work by a continental painter. The painting was acquired by the [[Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster|1st Duke of Westminster]] at an auction at [[Christie's]] in 1891; he donated it to the [[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]] in 1895, and it was transferred to the [[Tate Gallery]] in 1951.

==Print==
[[File:William Hogarth - O the Roast Beef of Old England.png|thumb|right|The engraving of the print. The hand on Hogarth's shoulder can now be clearly seen, as can the Scotsman and his fare]]
The print, produced from an engraving that was completed in part by Charles Mosley, was published on 6 March 1749. Entitled "O The Roast Beef of Old England", it was priced at 5 shillings and advertised as:

{{quote|A print design'd and engrav'd by MR HOGARTH, representing a PRODIGY which lately appear'd before the Gate of CALAIS.&lt;br /&gt;O the Roast-beef of Old England, &amp;c.&lt;br /&gt; To be had at the Golden Head in Leicester-Square, and at the Print Shops.}}

The main difference between the painting and the engraving is the crow on top of the gate, which is absent in the engraving. The crow was a late addition to the painting to disguise an accidental tear, apparently caused by the canvas falling on a nail shortly after it was completed, although no evidence of damage was found when the painting was restored in 1966.

'''''The Hiding Place''''' is a 1971 book on the life of [[Corrie ten Boom]], written by ten Boom together with [[John and Elizabeth Sherrill]].

The idea of a book on ten Boom's life began as John and Elizabeth Sherrill were doing research for the book ''[[God's Smuggler]]'', about ten Boom's fellow Dutchman, [[Andrew van der Bijl]].  Corrie ten Boom was already in her mid-seventies when the Sherrills first heard about her. She was one of Brother Andrew's favorite traveling companions and many of his recollections were about her. In the preface to the book, the Sherrills recount:

:''...his [Brother Andrew's] fascinating stories about her in Vietnam, where she had earned that most honorable title "Double-old Grandmother" - and in a dozen other Communist countries - came to mind so often that we finally had to hold up her hands to stop his flow of reminiscence. "We could never fit her into the book," we said. "She sounds like a book in herself." It's the sort of thing you say. Not meaning anything.''

It was later made into a [[The Hiding Place (film)|film of the same name]], along with a comic book adaptation.

The title refers to both the physical hiding place where the ten Boom family hid [[Jew]]s from the [[Nazi]]s, and also to the Scriptural message found in Psalm 119:114 which states, "Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word... "&lt;ref&gt;"[http://lib.store.yahoo.net/lib/monkeynote/pmHidingPlaceSample.pdf Literature notes on the Hiding Place]". ''PinkMonkey''. 2006. Accessed on May 31 of 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The book begins with the ten Boom family celebrating the 100th anniversary of the family [[watch]] and watch repair business, now run by the family's elderly father, [[Casper ten Boom]]. The business took up the ground floor of the family home (known as the Béjé). Casper lived with his unmarried daughters Corrie (the narrator and a watchmaker herself) and [[Betsie ten Boom|Betsie]], who took care of the house. It seemed as if everyone in the Dutch town of [[Haarlem]] had shown up to the party, including Corrie's sister Nollie, her brother Willem, and her nephews Peter and Kik. Willem, a minister in the [[Dutch Reformed Church]], brought a Jewish man, who had just escaped from Germany, as a guest. The man's beard had been burned off by some thugs, a grim reminder of what was happening just to the east of the Netherlands.

In the next few chapters, Corrie talks about her childhood, her infirm but glad-hearted mother, and the three aunts who once lived in the Béjé. She talks about the only man she ever loved, a young man named Karel, who ultimately married a woman from a rich family.

Eventually, both Nollie and Willem married. After the deaths of Corrie's mother and aunts, Corrie, Betsie, and their father settled down into a pleasant, domestic life. Then, in 1940, the [[Nazi]]s invaded the Netherlands.

The family had strong morals based on Christian beliefs, and they felt obligated to help their [[Jewish]] friends in every way possible. The Béjé soon became the center for a major anti-Nazi operation. Corrie, who had grown to think of herself as a middle-aged spinster, found herself involved in [[black market]] operations, using stolen [[ration card]]s, and eventually hiding Jews in her own home.

Corrie suffered a moral crisis over the lying, theft, [[forgery]], and [[bribery]] that was necessary to keep the Jews her family was hiding alive. Moreover, it was unlikely that her family would get away with helping Jews for long, as they had nowhere to hide them. The [[Dutch resistance|Dutch underground]] arranged for a secret room to be built in the Béjé, so the Jews would have a place to hide in the event of an inevitable raid.

It was a constant struggle for Corrie to keep the Jews safe; she sacrificed her own safety and part of her own personal room to give constant safety to the Jews. Rolf, a police officer friend, trained her to be able to think clearly anytime in case the Nazis invaded her home and started to question her.

When a man asked Corrie to help his wife, who had been arrested, Corrie agreed, but with misgivings. As it turned out, the man was a spy, and the watch shop was raided. The entire ten Boom family was arrested, along with the shop employees, though the Jews managed to hide themselves in the secret room.

Casper was in his mid-eighties by this time, and a Nazi official offered to let him go, provided he made no more trouble. Casper did not agree to this, and was shipped to prison. It was later learned he had died ten days later.

Meanwhile, Corrie was sent to [[Scheveningen]], a Dutch prison which was used by the Nazis for political prisoners, nicknamed 'Oranjehotel'--a hotel for people loyal to the [[House of Orange]].  She later learned that her sister was being held in another cell, and that, aside from her father, all other family members and friends had been released. A coded letter from Nollie revealed that the hidden Jews were safe. While at Scheveningen, Corrie befriended a depressed Nazi officer, who arranged a brief meeting with her family, under the pretense of reading Casper's will. Corrie was horrified to see how ill Willem was, as he had contracted [[jaundice]] in prison. He would eventually die from his illness in 1946. Corrie also learned that her nephew, Kik, had been captured while working with the Dutch underground. He had been killed, though the family did not learn of this until 1953.

After four months at Scheveningen, Corrie and Betsie were transferred to [[Vught#World War II|Vught]], a concentration camp for political prisoners in Netherlands. Corrie was assigned to a factory that made radios for aircraft. The work was not hard, and the prisoner-foreman, Mr. Moorman, was kind. Betsie, whose health was starting to fail, was sent to work sewing prison uniforms.

When a counter-offensive against the Nazis seemed imminent, the prisoners were shipped by train to Germany, where they were imprisoned at [[Ravensbrück concentration camp|Ravensbrück]], a notorious women's concentration camp. The conditions there were hellish; both Corrie and Betsie were forced to perform back-breaking manual labor. It was there that Betsie's health failed. Throughout the ordeal, Corrie was amazed at her sister's faith. In every camp, the sisters used a hidden [[Bible]] to teach their fellow prisoners about Jesus. In Ravensbrück, where there was only hatred and misery, Corrie found it hard to look to Heaven. Betsie, however, showed a universal love for everyone—not only for the prisoners, but also for the Nazis. Instead of feeling anger, she pitied the Germans, sorrowful that they were so blinded by hatred. She yearned to show them the love of Christ, but died before the war was over. Corrie was later released because of a clerical error, but she was forced to stay in a hospital barracks while recovering from [[edema]]. Corrie arrived back in the Netherlands by January 1945.

'''"The Professor of Practical Jokes"''' is a literary fairy tale published in 1898 by British [[suffragist]] and author [[Evelyn Sharp (suffragist)|Evelyn Sharp]] (1829–1955). The story tells of a good yet boring king who is tricked into marrying one of his courtiers daughters, who brings excitement into his dull kingdom. The story is one of many published in Sharp's collection, [[All the Way to Fairyland|All The Way To Fairyland: Fairy Stories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30400/30400-h/30400-h.htm#chap06 |title=The Project Gutenberg E-text of All the Way to Fairyland, by Evelyn Sharp |publisher=Gutenberg.org |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The story begins by introducing a King named Grumbelo. His kingdom is well governed and he is well loved, but his people find him dull and are quite bored. One day some of his [[courtiers]], one of whom is the Professor of Practical Jokes, approach him and suggest he find himself a wife in order to bring excitement to the kingdom. Grumbelo reluctantly agrees and sets his criteria: his wife must be the most beautiful, the most silent, and the most foolish princess in the world. With these specifications in mind, the king's courtiers begin gathering as many beautiful princesses as possible and present them to Grumbelo, who rejects each and every one of them because they aren't silent enough. After their failure, the courtiers once again approach Grumbelo and inform him of a princess who meets all of his criteria; however, she does not desire to marry ''him'' and has fled the kingdom. Intrigued by the notion that someone would not want to marry him, he decides to set out and find her. After extensive searching, the king comes upon a little house in the forest, guarded by a dragon. By conversing with the dragon he discovers that Lady Whimsical lives in the house. She shows no romantic interest in the king, but agrees to let him visit her for a period of time each day. The king is persistent in seeing her daily, but eventually grows tired of her silence, causing him to lose patience and run away . He realizes that he would like a wife who speaks, and guided by the Wise Woman of the Wood, he decides to return and admit his foolishness to Lady Whimsical. She happily welcomes him and admits a secret of her own: she hid herself on purpose because she heard he was looking for a princess and she wanted him to find her! There was never a princess for him to find, only her: the daughter of the Professor of Practical Jokes. Grumbelo and Lady Whimsical then return to the kingdom and marry, and the kingdom is happy as can be.

== About the Author ==
Primarily a journalist, Evelyn Sharp also wrote fantasy, novels, an account of dance, studies of children, a biography, an autobiography and a comic libretto.  In the composition of her literature for children, Sharp "followed her own advice, which is mentioned in ''The Books Children Like'' (1922), that writing should make children “feel on a level with the author”'.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Beverly Lyon. "Sharp, Evelyn." The Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature. : Oxford University Press, 2006. Oxford Reference. 2006. Date Accessed 10 Feb. 2013 &lt;http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780195146561.001.0001/acref-9780195146561-e-2948&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Oxford Encyclopedia of Children's Literature "Evelyn Sharp's collections ''[[Wymps and Other Fairy Tales]]'' (1897) and ''[[All the Way to Fairyland]]'' (1897), are contrasting works that take pleasure in turning things upside-down. Sharp enjoyed writing "anti-fairies", whom she called 'wymps', which emphasized common themes of people playing practical jokes and causing chaos".&lt;ref&gt;Manlove, C. N., and Inc ebrary.

'''The Starr Foundation''' was established in 1955 by [[Cornelius Vander Starr]], an insurance entrepreneur who founded C.V. Starr &amp; Co. and other companies later combined by his successor, Maurice R. Greenberg into what became the [[American International Group]].  Mr. Starr, a pioneer of globalization, set up his first insurance venture in Shanghai in 1919. Upon his death in 1968 his estate was passed on to the [[private foundation|foundation]]. Today, it gives between [[United States dollar|US$]]100 and 200 million each year to charities and causes globally.

Although the foundation is one of the largest in the country in terms of assets, with some $3.3 billion in 2006, it maintains a low profile.&lt;ref&gt;"http://starrfoundation.org"&lt;/ref&gt; It specializes in Asian arts and cultural philanthropy, but also makes grants in other areas, including education, medicine and healthcare, and public policy.

The foundation is no longer affiliated with AIG.

'''The Vera Project''', or '''VERA''', is an [[all-ages]], [[non-profit]] [[youth]] arts organization in [[Seattle]], Washington.

==Overview==
Based on the Vera club in [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], Netherlands.  The name Vera comes from the phrase Veri Et Recti Amici, which is Latin meaning "true and sincere friends".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=vera groningen - about|url=http://www.vera-groningen.nl/about#en|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seattle's VERA Project was founded in 2001 by James Keblas, Shannon Stewart&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Luck|first=Katherine|title=The Vera Project|url=http://www.myjournalmagazine.com/aug-2012/item/227-the-vera-project|work=Journal, Your Community Magazine|publisher=Metropolitan Graphics, Inc.|accessdate=16 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (both studied at the [[University of Groningen]] in 1999), and Kate Becker (founder of the [[Old Redmond Firehouse]]), along with the help of many other community organizers and the City of Seattle.

A good description of the project is a quote from its own website:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the Vera Project's web site|url=http://theveraproject.org/about/|accessdate=22 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:''Vera is an all-ages volunteer fueled music and arts venue. By engaging participants at all levels of music production and community organizing, Vera strives to fulfill its mission to foster a participatory creative culture through popular music concerts, arts programs, experiential learning and volunteer opportunities for all ages, especially young people. Vera’s programs are always all ages, with a focus on young people ages 14 to 24. Most Vera programs are at the Seattle Center venue, and include:''
:
:* Popular music concerts
:* Audio engineering training
:* Youth-driven governance
:* Visual art exhibits
:* Live and studio recording
:* Leadership training
:* Silkscreen printing/classes
:* Event production training
:* Internships
:* 
:''These activities are initiated and driven collaboratively by Vera’s volunteers, staff, Board of Directors and youth-led Membership.''

==Events==
The Vera Project's first event was hosted on January 27, 2001 at the [[International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers|IBEW]] Local 46&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brodeur|first=Nicole|title=Vera helps keep teens in tune|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20060409&amp;slug=brodeur09m1|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=April 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and featured local artists [[The Murder City Devils]], [[Botch (band)|Botch]] and [[The Blood Brothers (band)|The Blood Brothers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mark|first=Baumgarten|title=Mayor's Arts Awards: The Vera Project|url=http://cityartsonline.com/mayors-arts-awards-vera-project|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=City Arts (Seattle)|date=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Almost 1,000 people attended including local press and city officials. The Vera Project went on to host several more shows at IBEW Local 46 and then moved on to the [[Theatre Off Jackson]] when their lease expired at the IBEW Local 46. The Vera Project hosted shows at the Theatre Off Jackson until they found a longer-lasting home at 1916 4th Ave in 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scanlon|first=Tom|title=Unemployed?

The Vera Project hosted shows at various venues in Seattle until their current location, the corner of Warren Ave N. and Republican at the Seattle Center, was finished in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scanlon|first=Tom|title=Vera Project: movin' on up|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/entertainment/2003575876_vera20.html|accessdate=16 May 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The new Vera is open for business and hosting about two shows a week, along with a variety of other arts and media-related programming.

The Vera Project has hosted many successful local and national music acts including [[Band of Horses]], [[Chairlift (band)|Chairlift]], [[Dan Deacon]], [[The Evens]], [[Fruit Bats (band)|Fruit Bats]], [[Harvey Danger]], [[Lightning Bolt (band)|Lightning Bolt]], [[Minus the Bear]], [[Murs (rapper)|Murs]], [[No Age]], [[Shellac (band)|Shellac]], [[The Shins]], [[TV on the Radio]], [[Weezer]], [[Why? (American band)|WHY?]], [[Quasi]], [[Health (band)|Health]], [[Surfer Blood]], [[The Gossip]], [[Fleet Foxes]], [[Macklemore]] and [[Titus Andronicus (band)|Titus Andronicus]]. The [[Bellevue, Washington | Bellevue]], [[Seattle]] and [[West Seattle, Seattle | West Seattle]] versions of the [[School of Rock (company) | School of Rock]] perform shows frequently at this venue.

The '''toadstone''', also known as '''bufonite''', is a [[mythical]] stone or [[Gemstone|gem]] that was thought to be found in the head of a [[toad]]. It was supposed to be an [[antidote]] to [[poison]] and in this it is not unlike '''batrachite''', supposedly formed in the heads of frogs. Toadstones were actually the button-like [[fossilized]] teeth of ''[[Lepidotes]]'', an extinct genus of [[ray-finned fish]] from the [[Jurassic]] and [[Cretaceous]] periods. They appeared to be "stones that are perfect in form" and were set by European jewellers into magical rings and amulets from Medieval times until the 18th century.&lt;ref name='Independent UK Fossils1'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Fossils: myths, mystery and magic | date=2007-02-12 | publisher=Independent UK | url =https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/fossils-myths-mystery-and-magic-436005.html | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-13 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
From ancient times people associated the fossils with jewels that were set inside the heads of toads. The toad has poison glands in its skin, so it was naturally assumed that they carried their own antidote and that this took the form of a magical stone. They were first recorded by [[Pliny the Elder]] in the first century.

According to Paul Taylor of the London [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]:

{{quote|Like [[Shark tooth#History of discovery|tonguestones]], toadstones were considered to be antidotes for poison and were also used in the treatment of [[epilepsy]]". As early as the 14th century, people began to adorn jewelry with toadstones for their [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] abilities. In their folklore, a toadstone was required to be removed from an old toad while the creature was still alive, and as instructed by the 17th century [[naturalist]] [[Edward Topsell]], could be done by setting the toad on a piece of red cloth.}}

[[File:Lepidotes elvensis skull.jpg|thumb|[[Fossile|Fossilized]] ''[[Lepidotes]]'', showing detail of the skull, from which toadstones originated]]
[[File:Various toadstones.jpg|thumb|right|Toadstones from Jurassic sediments in Oxfordshire UK]]

The true toadstone was taken by contemporary jewellers to be no bigger than the nail of a hand and they varied in colour from a whitish brown through green to black, depending on where they were buried.&lt;ref name="17thC Lapidary"&gt;Thomas Nicols (1652). Lapidary, or, the History of Pretious Stones. Part ii, chapter xxxvi, pp.158-159.&lt;/ref&gt; They were supposedly most effective against poison when worn against the skin, on which occasion they were thought to heat up, sweat and change colour.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Widdowes alias Woodhouse (1631). [https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/5158807 Naturall Philosophy: Or Description of the World, and of the Severall Creatures therein contained]. Second Edition, corrected and enlarged.&lt;/ref&gt; If a person was bitten by a venomous creature a toadstone would be touched against the affected part to effect a cure.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Lupton (1576). A Thousand Notable Things, Of Sundry Sortes.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively  Johannes de Cuba, in his book ''Hortus sanitatis'', claimed that toadstone would help with kidney disease and earthly happiness.&lt;ref name=Campbell33&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell |first=Marian |date=2009 |title=Medieval Jewellery in Europe 1100-1500|publisher=V&amp;A Publishing |page=33 |isbn=9781851775828 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Loose toadstones were discovered among other gemstones in the Elizabethan [[Cheapside Hoard]] and there are surviving toadstone rings in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[British Museum]].

==Allusions in literature==

The toadstone is [[Allusion|alluded]] to by Duke Senior in [[Shakespeare's]] ''[[As You Like It]]'' (1599), in  Act 2, Scene 1, lines 12 through 14:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sweet are the uses of adversity; &lt;br /&gt;
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous, &lt;br /&gt;
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[James Branch Cabell]]'s [[short story]] "Balthazar's Daughter" (collected in ''The Certain Hour'') and its subsequent play adaptation ''The Jewel Merchants'', [[Alessandro de Medici]]  attempts to seduce Graciosa by listing various precious jewels in his possession, including "jewels cut from the brain of a toad".

Taking its name from medieval [[troubadour]]s, the '''Troubadour Style''', '''''style troubadour''''' in French, was a somewhat derisive term for French [[historical painting]] of the early 19th century with idealised depictions of the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Renaissance]].  It can be seen as an aspect of [[Romanticism]] and a reaction against [[Neoclassicism]], which was coming to an end at the end of the [[French Consulate|Consulate]], and became particularly associated with [[Josephine Bonaparte]] and [[Caroline Ferdinande Louise, duchesse de Berry]].  In architecture the style was an exuberant French equivalent to the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] of the Germanic and Anglophone countries.  The style related to contemporary developments [[19th-century French literature#Romanticism|in French literature]], and music, but the term is usually restricted to painting and architecture.

==History==
[[File:Richard Parkes Bonington - Henri III - WGA02429.jpg|thumb|left|300px|[[Richard Parkes Bonington]], ''[[Henri III of France]]'']]
The rediscovery of medieval civilization was one of the intellectual curiosities of the beginning of the 19th century, with much input from the [[Ancien Régime]] and its institutions, rites (the coronation ceremony dated back to the 16th century) and the medieval churches in which family ceremonies occurred.

Even while exhuming the remains of the kings and putting on the market a multitude of objects, works of art and elements of medieval architecture, the revolutionaries brought them back to life, it could be said.  The [[Musée des monuments français]] (Museum of French Monuments), established in the former convent that would become [[Paris]]'s [[École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts]], presented all this glorious debris of the Middle Ages as subjects of admiration for the public and as models of inspiration for students of the departments of engraving, painting and sculpture, but not those of architecture since teaching of this subject had been dissociated from the "beaux-arts" and placed in the École centrale des travaux publics under the direction of J.N.L Durand, a harsh promoter of the neoclassical architecture that characterized the styles of the [[French Convention|Convention]] and [[French Consulate|Consulate]].  Later, from the [[Bourbon Restoration]] and under the impulse of [[Quatremère de Quincy]] and [[Prosper Mérimée|Mérimée]], a new tradition of teaching architecture put it back under the fine arts umbrella, in the margins of the declining official school, beginning with private workshops that behaved as diocesan architects working for historic monuments that would give rise to the [[Société Centrale des Architectes]] and make Troubador-style architecture possible.

The resurgence of Christian feeling and in Christianity in the arts, with the publication in 1800 of ''Le Génie du Christianisme'' ('the Genius of Christianity'), played a major role in favour of edifying painting, sculpture and literature, often inspired by religion.

Artists and writers rejected the neo-antique rationalism of the [[French Revolution]] and turned towards a perceived glorious Christian past.  The progress of the history and archaeology in the course of the 18th century began to bear fruit, at first, in painting.  Paradoxically these painters of the past were unaware of the primitives of French painting, finding it too academic and not sufficiently filled with anecdote.
[[File:Chateau de Beauregard 475 Herouville Saint Clair Calvados.jpg|thumb|Chateau de Beauregard, [[Calvados (department)|Calvados]], 1864]]

Napoleon himself did not disdain this artistic current: he took as his emblem the golden beehive on the grave of the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingian]] king [[Childeric I]], rediscovered in the 17th century, and saw himself as the heir of the French monarchy.  He also gave official recognition to the Middle Ages in the forms of his coronation, and tried to profit from other trappings of the medieval French kings, perhaps even their miraculous curative powers (''[[Bonaparte visiting the plague-victims of Jaffa]]'' by [[Antoine-Jean Gros]] was read as a modern re-envisgaing of the [[Thaumaturgy|thaumaturgical]] kings).

==Literature==
Public interest in the Middle Ages in literature first manifested itself in France and above all England.  In France, this came with the adaptation and publication from 1778 of ancient chivalric romances by the [[Louis-Élisabeth de La Vergne de Tressan|Comte de Tressan]] (1707–1783) in his ''Bibliothèque des romans'', and in England with the first fantastical romances, like ''[[The Castle of Otranto]]''.  These English romances inspired late 18th century French writers to follow suit, such as [[Marquis de Sade|Donation de Sade]] with his ''[[Histoire secrete d'Isabelle de Baviere, reine de France]]''.  The ''Le Troubadour, poésies occitaniques'' (1803) by [[Fabre d'Olivet]] popularized the term, and may have led to the naming of the style in art.  The [[Waverley Novels]] of [[Walter Scott]] were hugely popular across Europe, and a major influence on both painting and French novelists such as [[Alexandre Dumas]] and [[Victor Hugo]].

==Painting==
[[Image:Revoil Pharamond eleve sur le pavois.jpg|thumb|left|350px|''Pharamond lifted on a shield by the Franks'', by [[Pierre-Henri Révoil]] and [[Michel Philibert Genod]], 1845]]
In painting, the troubadour style was represented by [[history painting]] portraying edifying historical episodes, often borrowing its smoothness, its minute and illusionistic description of detail, its rendering of fabrics, the intimate character of its familiar scenes and its other technical means from [[Dutch Golden Age painting]].  The paintings were typically rather small [[cabinet painting]]s, often showing quiet intimate anecdotal moments rather than moments of high drama, though these were both depicted. As well as figures from political history, famous artists and authors of the past were often shown, especially [[Raphael]] and [[Dante]].  Ingres' ''Death of Leonardo da Vinci'' in the arms of King [[Francois I of France]] is one of several works bringing rulers and artists together.  A number of paintings by [[Ingres]] are in the style, and lesser artists such as [[Pierre-Henri Révoil]] (1776–1842) and [[Fleury-François Richard]] (1777–1852) specialized in the style.  The Belgian [[Henri Leys]] painted in a more sombre version of the style much influenced by [[Northern Renaissance]] painting. [[Richard Parkes Bonington]] is better remembered for his landscapes, but also painted in the style, as did [[Eugène Delacroix]]. The peak period was brought to an end by the [[French Revolution of 1848|Revolution of 1848]], and later the arrival of [[Realism (art movement)|Realism]], although the style arguably merged into late 19th century [[academic painting]].  The transition can be seen in the work of [[Paul Delaroche]].
[[Image:Fleury-François Richard - Valentine of Milan Mourning her Husband, the Duke of Orléans.JPG|thumb|''[[Valentina Visconti|Valentine of Milan]] weeping for the death of her husband [[Louis I de Valois, Duke of Orléans|Louis of Orléans]]'' by [[François Fleury-Richard]] (c. 1802) [[Hermitage Museum]], [[Saint-Petersburg]]]]

Arguably the first troubadour painting was presented at the [[Salon (Paris)|Salon]] of 1802, under the [[French Consulate]].  It was a work by [[François Fleury-Richard|Fleury-Richard]], ''Valentine of Milan weeping for the death of her husband'', a subject which had come to the artist during a visit to the "[[Musée national des Monuments Français#History|musée des monuments français]]", a museum of French medieval monuments.  A tomb from this museum was included in the painting as that of the wife.  Thanks to its moving subject matter, the painting was an enormous success – seeing it, [[Jacques-Louis David|David]] cried "This resembles nothing anyone else has done, it's a new effect of colour; the figure is charming and full of expression, and this green curtain thrown across this window renders the illusion complete"&lt;!---Original - "Ca ne ressemble à personne, c’est aussi nouveau d’effet que de couleur ; la figure est charmante et pleine d’expression, et ce rideau vert jeté devant cette fenêtre fait une illusion complète"---&gt;.  Compositions lit from the back of the scene, with the foreground in semi-darkness, became rather a trademark of the early years of the style.

Fragonard's painting of  ''[[Francis I of France|François Premier]] reçu chevalier par Bayard'' (''[[Francis I of France|Francis I]] knighted by [[Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard|Bayard]]'', Salon of 1819) has to be read not as a rediscovery of a medieval past, but as a memory of a recent monarchic tradition.{{cn|date=June 2017}}

==Architecture==
A fashion for medieval architecture may be seen throughout 19th century Europe, originating in England, and a blooming of the [[Neogothic]] style, but in France this remains limited to certain 'feudal' buildings in the parks surrounding châteaux.

After the Troubadour style disappeared in painting, it seems to have continued (or re-emerged) in architecture, the decorative arts, literature and theatre.

===Troubador buildings===
* [[Château de Maulmont]] at [[Saint-Priest-de-Bramefant]], architect [[Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine]], formerly a hunting lodge on the royal domain of [[Randan, Puy-de-Dôme|Randan]] which was one of [[Louis-Philippe of France]]'s residences.
* Gallerie Saint-Louis, [[Palais de justice de Paris]], built in 1835 by [[Gisors (architect)|Gisors]] (1796–1866), in place of a gothic gallery he had demolished.
* [[Château de Pierrefonds]], [[Eugène Viollet-le-Duc]] architect.
* [[Château d'Aulteribe]], at [[Semantizon]], rebuilt by [[Henriette Onslow]], daughter of the musician [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]].
* [[Château du Barry (Lévignac)|Château du Barry]], at [[Lévignac]], a Neo-Gothic wing, by the brothers [[Auguste Virebent]]  and [[Pascal Virebent]] (1745–1831), architects in Toulouse.
* [[Château de la Rochepot]], reconstruction by [[Marie Pauline Cécile Dupond-White]] (1841–1898), widow Sadi-Carnot.
* [[Château de Clavières|Château de Clavières-Ayrens]], at [[Ayrens]], built by [[Ernest de La Salle de Rochemaure]]

==Decorative arts==
*  [[Horloge au troubadour]], in the [[Empire style|Empire-troubadour style]], 1810, by [[Masure (watchmaker)|Masure]] à [[Étampes]]
*  [[Service à chocolat Du Gesclin]], [[Sèvres porcelain|Manufacture de Sèvres]], cartoon by [[Alexandre-Évariste Fragonard]] (1780–1850)

==Bibliography==
{{commons category}}
*''Aux sources de l'ethnologie française, l'[[Académie celtique]]'', 1995, Nicole Belmont. This work traces the birth of the fashion for premodern architecture and literature, from the middle of the 18th century of the fad for the monuments of the architecture and literature (Middle Ages, High Middle Ages and Early Middle Ages) and the beginnings of new inventorising and research work on the topic among the [[Congregation of St. Maur|Benedictines of Saint-Maur]].

'''Tympan''' means skin, and is used in a variety of technical meanings.

*Astrolabes
In an [[astrolabe]], a tympan is a [[metal]] [[plate (metal)|plate]] on which the [[coordinates]] of the [[celestial sphere]] ([[azimuth]] and [[altitude]]) are engraved in a [[stereographic projection]]. A tympan is specific to a particular [[latitude]], so most astrolabes come with a set of interchangeable tympans suitable for use at different latitudes, usually those of particular cities of importance ([[Cairo]], [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], [[Jerusalem]]...).

*Printing
&lt;!--What about a picture?--&gt;
In hand-operated [[letterpress]] printing, the '''bruzer tympan''' is the taut cloth or paper mounted in a frame which is placed over the sheet of paper immediately prior to lowering the [[platen]] to make the impression.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tympan&lt;/ref&gt;

Bruzer's Tympan refers to a sheet of oiled manilla paper which was securely fastened to the face of the platen of a letterpress printing machine. Underneath the tympan would be a packing which would vary in grade of firmness relevant to the type or image to be printed.
Pre-cut tympan papers were relatively expensive and, as such, were reused depending on their condition and the nature of the work.
The under packing consisted of loose fibre paper/board (sometimes known as saffron) which absorbed the impact of the letterpress principle thus avoiding damage to the hand-set or pre-cast typography or engravings.

'''Uberfic''' (short for '''uber fanfic''', '''uberXena''') or simply '''uber''', '''über''', or '''ueber''' (from {{lang-de|über-}}, for 'over-' or 'supra-') is a genre of [[Alternate universe (fan fiction)|alternate universe]] [[fan fiction]] in which characters or events are portrayed somewhat closely to original [[Canon (fiction)|canon]] but usually in a different time period, place, or reality, many times featuring the [[ancestors]], [[Kinship|descendants]], or [[reincarnation]]s of canon characters, known as uber-characters. The uber-characters' names are never{{Cn|date=August 2015}} [[canon (fiction)|canon]].  The term originated in ''[[Xena: Warrior Princess]]'' fandom, coined in 1997 by Kym Taborn, the webmaster of the fansite Whoosh.org.&lt;ref&gt;*[http://www.whoosh.org Whoosh.org - The International Association of Xena Studies (IAXS)]&lt;/ref&gt;  This sort of story was used by the series itself, beginning with the second season episode "[[The Xena Scrolls]]".&lt;ref name="lunacy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena |title=Definitions |accessdate=2007-02-04 |author=Lunacy |date=2006-02-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070127090906/http://www.lunacyreviews.com/terms.shtm#Uber-Xena &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A common trend in Xena fanfics was to write Uber stories in which the characters' analogues discover that they are soulmates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genders.org/g34/g34_hamming.html Whatever Turns You On: Becoming-Lesbian and the Production of Desire in the Xenaverse]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''We, the Normal'''''   is a 1987 video by American [[video art]]ist [[George Kuchar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Everleth|first1=Mike|title=George Kuchar, R.I.P.|url=http://www.undergroundfilmjournal.com/george-kuchar-r-i-p/|work=Underground Film Journal|date=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''We, the Normal''  records Kuchar's trip to [[Boulder, Colorado]].&lt;ref name=world&gt;{{cite book|last1=Reinke|first1=Steve|authorlink1=Excrements of Time: A Brief Introduction to The World of George Kuchar, with Descriptive Notes to the Works|title=The World of George Kuchar|date=2006|publisher=VDB|location=Chicago|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the video, Kuchar addresses humanity, [[nature]], society.&lt;ref name=normal&gt;{{cite video | people=Kuchar, George (Director) | date=1987 | url=http://www.vdb.org/titles/we-normal | title=We, the Normal | medium=Video | location=Chicago | publisher=Video Data Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The video begins with a conversation about the heater's being turned off between George and his friend, Don, who is trying to take a nap. The video proceeds, as Kuchar lazes around the house, musing about his films and the "perfect [[hors d'oeuvre]]." George cuts between shots of what he is seeing, and shots of his face displaying his thoughts and discomfort with comedic effect.&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

At a [[Party#Dinner party|Dinner party]], George introduces his friend, Lorna, with apprehension. Kuchar claims that most people do not like Lorna.&lt;ref name=world/&gt; Later George confronts Jim, calling him Tim, who will be leading George and Don on a [[Hiking|hike]] the next day. They are to leave in the late morning, and it will be quite cold up there.&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

On the hike, George inserts his musings on humanity and [[nature]], as well as a slew of photographs. Throughout the hike, Kuchar records shots of the mountains up which they are hiking. As the three head further up into the mountains, George expresses a growing discomfort.&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

After the hike, George goes to Lorna's home. They talk about Lorna's daughter and her boyfriend, whom George refers to as a "little twerp."&lt;ref name=normal/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1639">The '''Yuan Center of Art''' ({{zh|北京元艺术中心}}) is a multifunctional arts center and gallery located in the [[Haidian District|Haidian]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]]. The center houses four large exhibition halls for visual art, an experimental theatre, conference and symposia spaces, and a restaurant. The design concept of the building integrates the elements of architectural [[minimalism]] with a traditional Chinese construction pattern called “jiugongge”.  A recent show, entitled ''After Culture: An Exhibition of Contemporary Chinese Painting'', featured the work of several major Chinese artists, including [[Ma Kelu]], [[Shang Yang]], [[Ma Lu]], [[Ding Fang]], and [[Peng Si]]. It was curated by [[Peng Feng]], the prominent art critic and Professor of [[Aesthetics]] at [[Peking University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchhouseforasianart.org/scholars.html Western and Chinese Scholars], Research House for Asian Art, Peking University&lt;/ref&gt; who also serves on the Yuan Center's directorial board.

A leading exhibitor of contemporary [[Chinese art]], the Yuan Center is located near the center of Beijing, unlike the [[798 Art Zone]] in outlying [[Dashanzi]].
