      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3345">'''48 Portraits''' is a group of works by the German painter [[Gerhard Richter]]. In the years {{nobr|1971{{ndash}}1972}} Richter created a series of portraits of personalities who influenced modernity in a [[Photorealism|photorealistic]] manner. Oriented towards a central imaginary observer, they give the impression of a modern painted [[frieze]] of portrait heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.kunstforum.de/artikel/face-as-interface/|title=Face as Interface – www.kunstforum.de|work=www.kunstforum.de|access-date=2018-09-14|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richter participated in the 1972 edition of the [[Venice Biennale]] with this work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.macba.cat/en/48-portraits-1513|title=48 Portraits|website=www.macba.cat|language=en|access-date=2018-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are exhibited in the [[Museum Ludwig]] in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.museum-ludwig.de/de/ausstellungen/rueckblick/2017/gerhard-richter-neue-bilder.html|title=Gerhard Richter.

'''''A Complete Collection of genteel and ingenious Conversation, according to the most polite mode and method now used at Court, and in the best Companies of England,''''' commonly known as '''''A Complete Collection of Genteel and Ingenious Conversation,''''' or more simply as '''''Polite Conversation''''' is a book by [[Jonathan Swift]] offering an [[Irony|ironic]] and [[Satire|satirical]] commentary on the perceived banality of conversation among the upper classes in early-18th century Great Britain written in the form of a reference guide for those lacking in conversational skill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/219/0417.html §17. "Genteel Conversation, Directions to Servants, Argument against abolishing Christianity," and other Pamphlets. IV. Swift. Vol. 9. From Steele and Addison to Pope and Swift. The Cambridge History of English and American Literature: An Encyclopedia...]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was completed in 1731, but may have been conceived of as early as 1704.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiqbook.com/boox/dailey/1399.shtml The Wines Of France. - André L Simon]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Swift's last works, it was written in between bouts of vertigo and was not presented for publication until 1738.&lt;ref&gt;A Modest Proposal and Other Satires, Introduction, pp. 23-24, George R. Levine, Prometheus Books, 1995, {{ISBN|0-87975-919-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aleksey Danilovich Kivshenko''' (Russian: Алексей Данилович Кившенко; 22 March 1851, [[Venyov]] - 2 October 1895, [[Heidelberg]]) was a Russian painter, primarily of historical scenes. Among the best-known were those depicting the [[History of the Russo-Turkish wars|Russo-Turkish Wars]]. He also created hunting and [[Genre art|genre]] scenes and was associated with the [[Peredvizhniki]].

==Biography==
He was born on a small [[stud farm]]. His father was interested in art and music, so he encouraged his son's early attempts at drawing. His first studies began when he was nine; at the [[Imperial Society for the Encouragement of the Arts]] with [[Ivan Kramskoi]].&lt;ref name="P"&gt;[http://www.artsait.ru/art/k/kivshenko/main.htm Brief biography] @ Russian Painting.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1867 to 1877, he was a student at the [[Imperial Academy of Arts]], under the direction of [[Kārlis Hūns]].&lt;ref name="R"&gt;[http://www.rusartnet.com/biographies/russian-artists/19th-century/late-19th-century/battle-painter/alexei-kivshenko Biographical notes] @ RusArtNet.&lt;/ref&gt; He also audited classes at the [[Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology|State Institute of Technology]] and the Medico-Surgical Academy, but these were not to his liking. While there, he helped support himself by working as a scribe for the [[Admiralty Board (Russian Empire)|Admiralty Board]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wyrnal.livejournal.com/80504.html Brief biography] @ LiveJournal.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880, after receiving a foreign fellowship, he began to travel extensively, visiting Paris, [[Düsseldorf]] and Munich, where he worked with [[Gabriel von Max]] and [[Wilhelm von Diez]].&lt;ref name="R" /&gt;  When he returned in 1884, the paintings he had produced earned him the title of "Academician". Later that year, he was commissioned by Tsar [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]] to create scenes from the recent [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–78)|Russo-Turkish War]], so he went to [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1801–1917)|Transcaucasia]] to make sketches. He also taught drawing at the [[Saint Petersburg Art and Industry Academy]] until 1889.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt;

In 1891, he accompanied [[Nikodim Kondakov]] on an archaeological expedition to Palestine and Syria, returning with numerous sketches of everyday life in the region, as well as the ancient buildings.&lt;ref name="P" /&gt; Many of these were used as book decorations. In 1893, he became a full member of the Academy and taught a class in battle painting.&lt;ref name="R" /&gt; He died of undisclosed causes during a visit to Germany.

[[File:Annunciation - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|''The Annunciation'', [[Oil painting|Oil]] [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred from wood to canvas]], c. 1434. [[National Gallery of Art]], [[Washington, DC]], 93 x 37 cm]]

'''''The Annunciation''''' is an oil painting by the [[Early Netherlandish painting|Early Netherlandish]] master [[Jan van Eyck]], from around 1434-1436.  The panel is housed in the [[National Gallery of Art]], in Washington D.C.  It was originally on [[panel painting|panel]] but has been [[transfer of panel paintings|transferred]] to canvas.  It is thought that it was the left (inner) wing of a [[triptych]]; there has been no sighting of the other wings since before 1817. The annunciation is a highly complex work, whose [[iconography]] is still debated by art historians.

The picture depicts the [[Annunciation]] by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] to the [[Virgin Mary]] that she will bear the son of God ([[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 1:26-38).  The inscription shows his words: &lt;small&gt;''AVE GRÃ. PLENA''&lt;/small&gt; or "Hail, full of grace...".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 28 "et ingressus angelus ad eam dixit  '''ave gratia plena''' Dominus tecum benedicta tu in mulieribus ..." - [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?book_id=49&amp;chapter=1&amp;version=4 Latin Vulgate];  28"And the angel came in unto her, and said, Hail, thou that art highly favoured, the Lord is with thee: blessed art thou among women." [[Authorised Version]]. [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Lucas%201%20;&amp;version=9; King James (Authorised) Version]&lt;/ref&gt;   She modestly draws back and responds, &lt;small&gt;''ECCE ANCILLA DÑI''&lt;/small&gt; or "Behold the [[handmaiden]] of the Lord".&lt;ref&gt;Contracted from 38"dixit autem Maria '''ecce ancilla Domini''' fiat mihi secundum verbum tuum et discessit ab illa angelus" Latin [[Vulgate]]; 38"And Mary said, Behold the handmaid of the Lord; be it unto me according to thy word. And the angel departed from her." King James/Authorised Version.&lt;/ref&gt;   The words appear upside down because they are directed to God and are therefore inscribed with a God's-eye view. The [[Seven gifts of the Holy Spirit]] descend to her on [[Seven rays|seven rays of light]] from the upper window to the left, with the dove symbolizing the [[Holy Spirit]] following the same path; "This is the moment God's plan for salvation is set in motion. Through Christ's human incarnation the old era of the Law is transformed into a new era of [[Divine Grace|Grace]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html|title=Jan van Eyck, Netherlandish, c. 1390 - 1441, The Annunciation, c. 1434/1436|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=National Gallery of Art|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Temple==
The setting develops this theme.  Mary was believed in the Middle Ages to have been a very studious girl who was engaged by the [[Temple of Jerusalem]] with other selected maidens to spin new curtains for the [[Holy of Holies]].&lt;ref&gt;Schiller p.34 The source was the [[apocrypha]]l [[Protoevangelium of James]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The book she is reading here is too large to be a lady's [[Book of Hours]]; as in other paintings she is engaged in serious study in a part of the Temple (one medieval authority specified  that she was reading the Book of Isaiah when Gabriel arrived).&lt;ref&gt;Schiller pp.34-5, 41-2.&lt;/ref&gt; The van Eycks were almost the first to use this setting in panel painting, but it appears earlier in [[illuminated manuscript]]s, and in an altarpiece of 1397 from the same monastery for which this painting was probably ordered.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.81, who does not mention the altarpiece of 1397 by [[Melchior Broederlam]] (from the Chartreuse de Champmol, now Dijon Museum) - Schiller p.49 &amp; (fig 111), also discussed in Purtle 1999,p.4, and in the Losh External link below (fig 4)[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Image:BroedelamAnnunciation.jpg]&lt;/ref&gt;

The architecture moves from older, round [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] forms above, to (slightly) pointed Gothic arches below, with the higher levels largely in darkness, and the floor level well-lit.&lt;ref&gt;Many recent writers have stressed that the architecture of the buildings is not as anomalous, and therefore symbolic, as it might appear, and as Panovsky thought it. See Harbison pp. 151-57, &amp; 212, also Purtle 1999, p.3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;  The gloom of the [[Old Covenant]] is about to be succeeded by the light of the [[New Covenant]].  The flat timber roof is in poor repair, with planks out of place.&lt;ref&gt;Purtle, 1999, p 2 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of Romanesque architecture to identify Jewish rather than Christian settings is a regular feature of the paintings of van Eyck and his followers, and other paintings show both styles in the same building in a symbolic way.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, pp. 49-50. Purtle 1999, p. 4 and notes 9-14. Also see Gallery, and [http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf ''The Iconography of the Temple in Northern Renaissance Art'' by Yona Pinson] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090326170616/http://www.tau.ac.il/arts/projects/PUB/assaph-art/assaph2/articles_assaph2/09Pinson.pdf |date=2009-03-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[File:Jan van Eyck 081.jpg|thumb|left|Floor tiles: [[David]] slaying [[Goliath]] in front, [[Samson]] pulling down the [[Philistine]]s' Temple behind]]

The decoration of the Temple is naturally all derived from the [[Old Testament]], but the subjects shown are those believed in the Middle Ages to prefigure the coming of Christ the [[Messiah]].  In the floor tiles [[David]]'s slaying of [[Goliath]] (centre front), foretells Christ's triumph over the devil.  Behind this, [[Samson]] pulls down the Temple of the [[Philistine]]s, prefiguring both the Crucifixion and the [[Last Judgement]], according to medieval authorities.  To the left, [[Delilah]] is cutting Samson's hair (Betrayal of Christ), and behind he slays the Philistines (Christ's triumph over sin).   The death of [[Absalom]] and possibly that of [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] are identified by some art historians, although only tiny sections are visible.  [[Erwin Panofsky]], who developed much of this analysis, proposed a scheme for the significance of the [[astrological symbol]]s in the round border tiles, and other versions have been suggested.&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp. 80-1&lt;/ref&gt;

The rear wall has a single stained glass window, where Jehovah stands, above triple plain-glazed windows below, which perhaps suggest the Christian trinity.  On either side of the single window are dim wall-paintings of the ''Finding of Moses'' by [[Pharaoh]]'s daughter (left, pre-figuring the Annunciation itself), and Moses receiving the [[Ten Commandments]] (right, paralleling the [[New Covenant]] Christ would bring).  Below them are roundels with [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]], for which various symbolic functions have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.80, Purtle, 1999, pp 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  The lilies are a traditional attribute of Mary, standing for purity.  The empty stool may be an "[[hetoimasia|empty throne]]", a symbol for Christ going back to early [[Byzantine art]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand pp 79 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt;

==The figures==
[[File:Annunciation - Virgin and Angel - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|thumb|right|330px|Detail - Mary and Gabriel]]

It has been suggested that Mary has been given the features of [[Infanta Isabel, Duchess of Burgundy|Isabella of Portugal]], wife of [[Philip the Good]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], who may well have commissioned the painting from van Eyck, his (part-time) court painter.&lt;ref&gt;Hand 1986, p.82. Carra Ferguson O'Meara (1981) originated the suggestion&lt;/ref&gt;  Mary wears a robe in her usual blue, which is trimmed in [[ermine]], reserved for royalty, which would suit this theory, although the Middle Ages placed great emphasis on Mary's [[Davidic line|royal descent]] in any case.  As is usual, especially in the North, Mary's features are less attractive than those of Gabriel; being a sexless angel there was considered to be no possibility of his beauty causing inappropriate thoughts in the onlooker.  Neither figure has a [[halo (religious iconography)|halo]]; these were being dispensed with in Early Netherlandish art in the interests of realism - eventually the Italians would follow.  Mary's posture is ambiguous; it is not clear if she is standing, kneeling or sitting.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.76&lt;/ref&gt;

===Size===
Many writers, including Hand, call the figures over-large compared to the architecture.  This is certainly a feature of some of van Eyck's depictions of Mary in a Church setting, with a particular theological meaning.  In ''[[Madonna in the Church]]'' in the [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]] where this theme is most developed: the figure of Mary is some sixty feet high, filling much of the height of a tall Gothic church.&lt;ref&gt;Harbison, 1991, pp. 169-187&lt;/ref&gt; It is not so clear that any effect of this type is intended here; there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building.  If, for example, the setting were a first floor room, or one giving on to a courtyard, the windows might be lower than is normal in a medieval church.  The size of the plain glass roundels does not seem disproportionate with the figures.

===Sacramental themes===
[[File:Louvre Le sacerdoce de la Vierge.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' (The Priesthood of the Virgin), 1425-50, Louvre, unknown French artist]]
Another of van Eyck's themes, and that of other Early Netherlandish painters, is indicated by the large [[cope]] over a [[dalmatic]] worn by [[Gabriel]].  This would, in a human, mark him as a celebrant or attendant at a [[Solemn Mass|High Mass]].  Mary is facing a table with a book upon it about the right size to be a [[Gospel Book]] or [[Missal]], and has her hands raised in a gesture known as the ''expansis manibus''.  This is certainly to convey the alarm and uncertainty with which she usually greets the surprising apparition of Gabriel and his news, but is also a gesture used by a priest at certain points of a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81 and notes&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has been connected with the ''Golden Mass'' ("Missa Aurea"), a [[liturgical drama]], or dramatised Mass, popular in the Netherlands at the time, which included a staging of the Annunciation as the [[Gospel]] reading.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81, and Lane, pp 47-50; both citing: Carol J Purtle, 1982. Also Purtle 1999 note 19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jacobus, 1999, pp 1-4 describes the Golden Mass in the context of Giotto's Arena Chapel frescoes&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, this is part of a common theme in Early Netherlandish art where Mary, as intermediary between the faithful and God, is compared to, or seen as, a priest celebrating Mass.  Her personal sacrifice of her son  is compared to the ritual sacrifice enacted by the priest in the Mass.  In a surviving extreme example in the [[Louvre]] she is shown clearly wearing vestments and celebrating mass at an [[altar]]; more often, as here, the comparison is made more subtly.&lt;ref&gt;Lane, 1984, pp 41-77. The Louvre ''Le sacerdoce de la Vierge'' is fig 47&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other panels of the triptych==
No more has been heard of the rest of the triptych since the mentions below in the Provenance.  It would presumably have been an altarpiece, for a side-altar or small chapel.  The subjects of the other missing panels remain uncertain; a ''[[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]'' or ''[[Adoration of the Magi]]'' are considered most likely for the central panel, at least twice as wide as this one, with a ''Visitation of Mary'' or ''Presentation of Jesus'' on the right-hand wing matching this one.  The outer sides of the wings would probably have been painted in some fashion, but if there was a full scene, or even a figure in [[grisaille]] on the back of this, it is unlikely it would have been discarded when the painting was transferred to canvas in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.81&lt;/ref&gt;  No doubt the themes of this wing would originally have related to those in the other wings in ways we cannot now guess.

==Painting technique==
[[File:Jan van Eyck 078.jpg|thumb|230px|The rear wall: Moses found in the bullrushes on the wall, [[stained glass]] of [[Jehovah]], with [[Seraphim]] above. The wall-painting is not in the underdrawing]]
A cleaning in 1998, and examination by modern technical methods such as infrared reflectograms, has revealed much about van Eyck's technique here, which is consistent with other works of his such as the [[Arnolfini Portrait]].  His [[underdrawing]] has been revealed, and so have many changes made in the course of painting the work.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Eyck's superb oil painting technique is evident throughout.  [[Gold leaf]] is only used for the seven rays coming in from the left; paint is used for all the gold on Gabriel, often worked [[wet-on-wet]] to achieve the textural effects of his [[brocade]]d clothes.  In a shadowy area behind the stool van Eyck worked a glaze with his fingers.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;  The play of light over the many different textures in the painting is brilliantly rendered, and the illusionistic detail, especially in Gabriel's rich costume, is exceptional.

Apart from several small changes in the position of hands and faces, the under-drawing shows that the small pilasters on the left wall were originally planned to be repeated on the rear wall, and to be much taller, reaching nearly to the roof, on both.  The paint on the rear wall is thicker than on the left wall, so he may have painted the pilasters before changing his mind.  In the underdrawing the ceiling planks are all in place, and there was also a light source to the right, for which the shadows are drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 2 &amp; 3&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative scenes on the tiles replace a simpler decorative plan in the underdrawing, and the stool has become much larger. The vase of lilies was not only absent in the underdrawing, but was not reserved, that is to say that a space was not left for it in the paint for the Virgin's robe or the floor.  This suggests it was only added late in the course of painting.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford pp 4 &amp; 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Examination of other major van Eyck works reveals similar developments from the underdrawing, and in the course of painting, in these works.  It seems van Eyck, perhaps acting with clerical advisers, although he appears to have been a considerable reader himself, liked to add further complexity to his compositions in the course of work on them.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

==Condition and date==
The painting was transferred from panel to canvas in the 19th century. It received a major cleaning in 1998, when varnish and some overpaint was removed, and a technical study undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Gifford, p1&lt;/ref&gt;  Writing before this, the NGA catalogue described the painting as extensively restored.  Craquelure (fine cracking to the surface) had been painted over, especially in the background.  Repainted areas included parts of Gabriel's face and hair, and the Virgin's robe, which appeared to have also lost a layer of glaze.&lt;ref&gt;Hand, p76&lt;/ref&gt;

The range of dates given for the painting was previously from 1428-29 (Panofsky and others) to 1436-37, but the discovery in 1959 of a date of 1437 on an altarpiece in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]], [[Dresden]] has considerably changed all van Eyck dating, and "makes it all but impossible to continue dating the ''Annunciation'' before 1432" (Hand).  The painting appears stylistically to come between the [[Ghent Altarpiece]] and late works such as the Berlin ''Virgin in a church''.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82&lt;/ref&gt;

Two authorities have considered the painting to belong to Jan's brother [[Hubert van Eyck]], who died in 1426.  It is thought that the recent cleaning or technical investigation has tended to confirm the majority view that it is an autograph work by Jan.&lt;ref&gt;Hand p.82, Gifford p.1 on the recent work on the painting&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Annunciation - Lily and the floor - Jan van Eyck - 1434 - NG Wash DC.jpg|Detail with the lily, the stool and the floor.|250px|thumb]]

==Provenance==
The [[provenance]] of the painting, as far as it is known, is:&lt;ref&gt;unless otherwise stated, Hand, 1986, p.76 &amp; notes&lt;/ref&gt;
*1791 - A visitor to the [[Chartreuse de Champmol]], a [[Carthusian]] monastery in [[Dijon]], now in France, but in the 15th century the capital of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]], recorded seeing in the [[Prior]]'s room paintings, originally in the ducal chapel of the monastery: "... paintings on wood of the type of the earliest Flemish painters, which come from the chapels of the Dukes; they are about four feet high. The first, about a foot wide, is an Annunciation..."  The monastery was very largely destroyed in the French Revolution, but had been the burial place of the Dukes of Burgundy, and contained many important works.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Well of Moses'' by [[Claus Sluter]] remains ''in situ'', a Crucifixion by [[Jean Malouel]] of ca. 1398 is in the [[Louvre]]. The Broederlam altarpiece also came from the monastery.&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting mentioned is thought likely to be the Washington painting, although the measurements (in the French ''pied'', or ''foot'', of the period) do not match very exactly.   
*1817 - Bought at an auction sale in Paris by the major dealer C.J. Nieuwenhuys of Brussels, who sold it to [[William II, King of the Netherlands]]. In Brussels until 1841, then in The Hague. In a book of 1843 Nieuwenhuys says of the picture that it was "from a set with two others by the same master, painted for [[Philip the Good]] and destined to adorn a religious foundation in Dijon". A modern scholar has also claimed that the Virgin has the features of Philip's Duchess [[Isabella of Portugal]].   
*1850 - Lot 1 in an auction in The Hague, bought by Czar [[Nicholas I of Russia]] for the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]].  Probably between 1864 and 1870 the Hermitage transferred it to canvas, as is often done with [[panel painting]]s when the wood develops problems. 
*1929 - Franz Matthiesen, a young German art dealer, was asked by the Soviet Government to compile a list of the hundred paintings in Russian collections which should never be sold under any circumstances. He was most surprised to be shown several of these paintings not long after in Paris by [[Calouste Gulbenkian]], who had traded them with the Russians for oil.  Gulbenkian wanted him to act as his agent on further purchases, but Matthiesen instead [[Soviet sale of Hermitage paintings|formed a consortium]] with [[Colnaghi]]'s of London and [[Knoedler]] &amp; Co of New York, which in 1930 and 1931 bought paintings and other works from the Russians, of which [[List of original Hermitage paintings in the National Gallery of Art|twenty-one paintings]] were bought by [[Andrew Mellon]], who had been offered first refusal. All are now in the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, where they form some of the most important paintings in the collection (two works by Raphael, also including works by Botticelli, Titian, Veronese, Velázquez, Rembrandt).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, 1964, pp 24-6&lt;/ref&gt;    
*1930 - Bought by Andrew Mellon via the consortium described above. In 1931 it was deeded to the [[Mellon Trust]], which gifted it in 1937 to the National Gallery of Art, whose construction began in that year.&lt;ref name="NGA"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Annunciation - Provenance |url=https://www.nga.gov/collection/art-object-page.46.html#provenance |website=National Gallery of Art |accessdate=24 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trust fund"&gt;{{cite web |title=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1797">{{About|the royal medieval hall|the town known in Latin as Aula Regia|Zbraslav}}

An '''''aula regia''''' ([[Latin|lat.]] for "royal hall"), also referred to as a ''[[palas]] hall'', is a name given to the great hall in an imperial or royal palace (German ''[[Königspfalz|Pfalz]]''). In the [[Middle Ages]] the term was also used as a synonym for the ''Pfalz'' itself.

An example of a surviving, former [[Visigothic]] ''aula regia'' is the church of [[Santa María del Naranco]] near [[Oviedo]], built around 850 as an ''aula regia'' for [[Ramiro I of Asturias|Ramiros I]].&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner/Fleming/Honour, ''Lexikon der Weltarchitektur'', Reinbek 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; There was also an ''aula regia'' in the [[Palace of Aachen]]ː it later became a part of the medieval [[Aachen Rathaus|Town Hall of Aachen]]. The royal hall of the ''[[Kaiserpfalz]]'' at Ingelheim has been digitally reconstructed. The architectural prototype for all of them was the [[Aula Palatina|Basilica of Constantine]] in [[Trier]].

The reception room in the [[Domus Flavia]], the palace of [[Domitian]] on the [[Palatine Hill]] in [[Rome]], is also called the ''Aula Regia''.

It is located near the Black Sea. The museum offers contemporary art and traditional handcrafts.  The basic aim of the foundation is, as quoted by founder Professor Hüsamettin Koçan, to "disseminate art and culture by bringing together contemporary and traditional art, to collect, document, classify, preserve and promote works of contemporary and traditional art, to use this base in realizing creation, and to hand local and national cultural values down to future generations" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.baksi.org/about-baksi/what-kind-of-museum.aspx?lvl1=1|title=Baksı Müzesi|website=en.baksi.org|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
The museum was the idea of the painter and academic Professor [[Hüsamettin Koçan]], who decided to build a museum in his hometown in the [[Black Sea]] region of Bayburt.&lt;ref name=hur&gt;{{cite news|last=Sanat|first=Milliyet|title=Black Sea museum combines Turkish crafts, contemporary art|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=traditional-and-the-contemporary-combines-2010-07-14|accessdate=2014-03-09|newspaper=Huriyet Daily News|date=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The museum was opened in July, 2010, after taking approximately 20 years of preparation. Professor Hüsamettin Koçan said, “I didn’t do this for my own village, I did it for the people who live in my village and everywhere.”

A '''boom operator''' is an assistant of the [[production sound mixer]]. The principal responsibility of the boom [[Operator (profession)|operator]] is [[microphone]] placement, usually using a boom pole (or "fishpole") with a microphone attached to the end (called a boom mic), their aim being to hold the microphone as close to the actors or action as possible without allowing the microphone or boom pole to enter the camera's frame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.media-match.com/usa/jobtypes/boom-operator-jobs-402683.php media-match.com, Boom Operator, What do Boom Operators do?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention of the boom mic==

The first noted use of a boom mic was on the set of ''[[Beggars of Life]]'' (1928) when director [[William A. Wellman]] wanted a [[tracking shot]] of two actors walking down a street, and the [[Production sound mixer|sound man]] refused, telling the director that the actors had to be static and the microphone had to be hidden in a flowery vase. Wellman said "that's crazy" and instructed the sound man to put the microphone on a broom-handle and walk along the actors just outside of the frame.&lt;ref&gt;''Wild Bill: Hollywood Maverick'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[David O. Selznick]], "I was also present on the stage when a microphone was moved for the first time by Wellman, believe it or not. Sound was relatively new and at that time the sound engineer insisted that the microphone be steady. Wellman, who had quite a temper in those days, got very angry, took the microphone himself, hung it on a boom, gave orders to record—and moved it."&lt;ref&gt;''The Parade's Gone By...'' (1992) p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

Another instance of a prototype boom mic was on ''[[The Wild Party (1929 film)|The Wild Party]]'' (1929). To allow [[Clara Bow]] to move freely on the set, director [[Dorothy Arzner]] had technicians rig a microphone onto a fishing rod.&lt;ref name=geller&gt;{{cite web|author=Geller, Theresa L.|title=Dorothy Arzner|work=Great Directors|publisher=Senses of Cinema|url=http://www.sensesofcinema.com/2003/great-directors/arzner|accessdate=2007-04-20|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210225806/http://www.sensesofcinema.com/contents/directors/03/arzner.html|archivedate=2007-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/dorothy-arzner-hidden-star-maker-of-hollywood-s-golden-age |  title = Dorothy Arzner, Hidden Star Maker of Hollywood's Golden Age |accessdate = July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent was filed a year later for a very similar sound-recording device by Edmund H Hansen, a sound engineer at the [[Fox Film Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seger |first1=Linda S. |title=When Women Call the Shots: The Developing Power and Influence of Women in Television and Film|date=2003|isbn=0595268382|page=15}}&lt;!--|accessdate=July 17, 2015--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Often in television studios, the boom operator will use a "fisher boom", which is a more intricate and specialized piece of equipment on which the operator stands, allowing precise control of the microphone at a greater distance from the actors. They will also attach [[wireless microphone]]s to persons whose voice requires recording. Boom poles are usually manufactured from several lengths of aluminum or carbon fibre tubing, allowing the boom to be extended and collapsed as the situation requires.

Some poles have a microphone cable routed through the inside of the pole, which may be a regular cable protruding at the bottom end, or a coiled cable that can extend with the pole, connecting to a socket at the base into which the operator plugs the microphone cable. The ideal boom pole is lightweight and strong, supporting the weight of the microphone on the end while adding as little weight as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://getinmedia.com/careers/boom-operator getinmedia.com, Boom operator]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently, a wind-attenuating cover, called a "[[Microphone#Blimps|blimp]]" or "mic-blimp", is used to enclose the microphone. A blimp covered with sound-absorbing fuzzy fabric is usually nicknamed a windmuff or a "dead cat". In film crew jargon, the gruesome-sounding phrase ''dead cat on a stick'' is simply a boom microphone fitted with a fuzzy wind-screen.

The boom operator and production sound mixer may often be combined into a job performed by one person, usually when the crew number is to be kept minimal, such as for documentaries or news collecting, or in low-budget productions. The one-man unit is often known simply as a "sound recordist" or "sound man", and would perform all on set sound duties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://work.chron.com/boom-operator-job-26102.html work.chron.com, boom operator]&lt;/ref&gt;

The boom operator must decide where to place the microphone based on a combination of factors, including the location and projection of any dialogue, the frame position of the camera, the source of lighting (and hence shadows) and any unwanted noise sources. Often the boom operator will need to be as familiar with the script as are the actors, as they may be required to tilt or move the microphone according to who is speaking.

In productions with a bigger budget, more than one boom operator may be used, with each operator focusing on a different actor.

Having the boom mic or its shadow appear on the screen in a completed picture is considered a sign of poor film-making. Notable examples include the mic's shadow appearing above two crewmen flying a plane in ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' and the mic itself dipping into the frame numerous times in [[Rudy Ray Moore]]'s film ''[[Dolemite]]''. The [[TV Tropes]] wiki has a list on its "Visible Boom Mic" trope page demonstrating more examples.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VisibleBoomMic&lt;/ref&gt; Pastiches of bad film-making may also use boom mic visibility to spoof their material.

'''Botanical illustration''' is the art of depicting the form, color, and details of plant species, frequently in [[watercolor]] paintings.  They must be scientifically accurate but often also have an artistic component and may be printed with a botanical description in books, magazines, and other media or sold as a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Sydney Living Museums|title=The art in the illustration|date=2016-07-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGxHTUgcYv0|accessdate=2016-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of [[plant morphology]] and access to specimens and references.

==History==
Early [[herbals]] and [[pharmacopoeia]] of many cultures have included the depiction of plants. This was intended to assist identification of a species, usually with some medicinal purpose. The earliest surviving illustrated botanical work is the Codex vindobonensis. It is a copy of [[Dioscorides]]'s ''[[De Materia Medica]]'', and was made in the year 512 for Juliana Anicia, daughter of the former Western Roman Emperor Olybrius.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/shirley-sherwood-gallery.htm# |title=Kew Gardens website |access-date=2011-03-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102005902/http://www.kew.org/visit-kew-gardens/garden-attractions-A-Z/shirley-sherwood-gallery.htm# |archive-date=2011-01-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem of accurately describing plants between regions and languages, before the introduction of [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], were potentially hazardous to medicinal preparations. The low quality of printing of early works sometimes presents difficulties in identifying the species depicted.   

When systems of [[botanical nomenclature]] began to be published, the need for a drawing or painting became optional.  However, it was at this time that the  profession of [[botanical illustrator]] began to emerge. The eighteenth century saw many advances in the printing processes, and the [[illustration]]s became more accurate in colour and detail. The increasing interest of amateur botanists, gardeners, and natural historians provided a market for botanical publications; the illustrations increased the appeal and accessibility of these to the general reader.
The field guides, [[Flora]]s, catalogues and magazines produced since this time have continued to include illustrations.  The development of photographic plates has not made illustration obsolete, despite the improvements in reproducing photographs in printed materials.  A botanical illustrator is able to create a compromise of accuracy, an idealized image from several specimens, and the inclusion of the face and reverse of the features such as leaves. Additionally, details of sections can be given at a magnified scale and included around the margins around the image.

[[File:ViennaDioscoridesPlant.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Blackberry]]. ''[[Vienna Dioscurides]]'', early sixth century]]

Botanical illustration is a feature of many notable books on plants, a list of these would include: 
*[[Vienna Dioscurides]]
*''[[Flora Graeca]]''
*''[[The Banksias]]''
*''[[Curtis's Botanical Magazine]]''
*''[[The Cactaceae]]''

Recently a renaissance has been occurring in botanical art and illustration. Organizations devoted to furthering the art form are found in the US ([[American Society of Botanical Artists]]), UK (Society of Botanical Artists), Australia (Botanical Art Society of Australia), and South Africa (Botanical Artists Association of South Africa), among others. The reasons for this resurgence are many. In addition to the need for clear scientific illustration, botanical depictions continue to be one of the most popular forms of "wall art". There is an increasing interest in the changes occurring in the natural world, and in the central role plants play in maintaining healthy ecosystems. A sense of urgency has developed in recording today's changing plant life for future generations. Working in media long understood provides confidence in the long-term conservation of the drawings, paintings, and etchings. 
Many artists are drawn to more traditional figurative work, and find plant depiction a perfect fit. Working with scientists, conservationists, horticulturists, and galleries locally and around the world, today's illustrators and artists are pushing the boundaries of what has traditionally been considered part of the genre.

'''Chambers of rhetoric''' ({{lang-nl|rederijkerskamers}}) were dramatic societies in the [[Low Countries]]. Their members were called Rederijkers (singular Rederijker), from the [[French language|French]] word 'rhétoricien', and during the 15th and 16th centuries were mainly interested in dramas and [[lyrics]]. These societies were closely connected with local civic leaders and their public plays were a form of early [[public relations]] for the city.&lt;ref name=Waite&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g9ntQF9q1rAC Reformers on stage: popular drama and religious propaganda in the low countries] by Gary Waite on [[Google books]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first chambers of rhetoric were founded in [[Flanders]] around the 15th century; they later flowered in [[Holland]], where they were an important part of the literary scene in the [[Dutch Golden Age]] and experimented with poetic form and structure. Most Dutch cities sponsored a chamber of rhetoric, and many cities had more than one, which competed with each other during prize contests. The building that currently houses the [[Frans Hals Museum]] was built with the proceeds of a lottery in which chambers of rhetoric participated from all over the country. The Haarlem society [[Trou moet Blycken]] still has many of the blazoens that it kept as host of that lottery.

At the start of the 16th century, Antwerp had three rederijker societies, the "[[Violieren]]", the "[[De Olijftak|Olijftak]]", and the "[[Goudbloem]]", while Brussels and Ghent each had four rederijker societies.&lt;ref name=Waite/&gt;

An important chamber of rhetoric in the Netherlands was "De [[Egelantier]]" in Amsterdam: [[Samuel Coster|Coster]], [[Gerbrand Adriaensz Bredero|Bredero]], [[Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft|Hooft]] and [[Roemer Visscher]] were all members of this society. During the [[Protestant Reformation]] the society sided with the reformers against the city government and enjoyed its most blooming period despite receiving very little funding from official sources.&lt;ref name=Waite/&gt;

Because many of the ''rederijkers'' were by definition amateurs, the literary quality of their work was often rather low, and in the 18th century, some chambers of rhetoric were spoken of with contempt.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} One work of literary historical importance that came from the Rederijkers is the play ''[[Elckerlijc]]'' (Everyman).

By the 17th century many chambers enjoyed the services of semi-professional actors, ''personagiën'', who did not pay membership fees and worked in exchange for free food and drink (provided after rehearsals and performances) and for exemption from other civic obligations.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Keersmaekers, ''Geschiedenis van de Antwerpse Rederijkerskamers in de jaren 1585–1635'' (Aalst, 1952), pp. 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social functions==
Apart from providing entertainment (recitations, plays, performances) during civic festivities, and maintaining literary contacts between cities, chambers of rhetoric had many of the typical social functions of a [[guild]] or [[confraternity]], such as attending members' funerals, holding collections for sick or impoverished members, and providing wedding presents for members getting married.&lt;ref&gt;A. A. Keersmaekers, ''Geschiedenis van de Antwerpse Rederijkerskamers in de jaren 1585–1635'' (Aalst, 1952), pp. 9–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Crash Override Network''' is a support group for victims of large scale online abuse, including [[revenge porn]] and [[doxing]].&lt;ref name="Free of charge"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/apr/13/online-abuse-how-women-are-fighting-back | title=Online abuse: how women are fighting back | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=13 April 2016 | accessdate=13 April 2016 | author=Alexander, Leigh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph" /&gt;&lt;ref name="destructoid" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cohen" /&gt;

== History ==
Crash Override was founded by game developers [[Zoë Quinn]] and Alex Lifschitz,&lt;ref name="wired" /&gt; and is staffed exclusively by victims of online abuse whose identities are kept anonymous outside the group.&lt;ref name="tnw" /&gt; Quinn and Lifschitz were subjected to online abuse during the [[Gamergate controversy]], having both received death threats and doxing attacks.&lt;ref name="csm" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="latimes20150204" /&gt;

Crash Override formed a partnership with [[Feminist Frequency]] in March 2016, which serves as its fiscal sponsor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://feministfrequency.com/2016/03/03/feminist-frequency-and-crash-override-partnership/|title=Feminist Frequency and Crash Override Partnership|last=Sarkeesian|first=Anita|date=3 March 2016|website=Feminist Frequency|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
The founders of Crash Override consider it a conversation starter, a repository for addressing problems that others in and out of the gaming community "have long hoped would simply go away."&lt;ref name=latimes20150204 /&gt; The organisation's services are divided into three categories: ongoing assistance for victims, crisis centre support, and community outreach.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name="monitor" /&gt; They provide post-crisis counseling services,&lt;ref name=destructoid /&gt; help seeking shelter,&lt;ref name=monitor /&gt; and access to experts in information security, [[White hat (computer security)|white hat hacking]], law enforcement, public relations and threat monitoring.&lt;ref name=pc /&gt;&lt;ref name=tnw /&gt; The network tailors a unique plan of action for each victim&lt;ref name=monitor /&gt; and works with law enforcement, the media, and social media.&lt;ref name=monitor /&gt; They promise to help victims regardless of previous affiliations and ideology, including Gamergate supporters.&lt;ref name=destructoid /&gt;

The group has been credited with defusing a [[swatting]] attack by advising the target to preemptively contact the police.&lt;ref name=wired /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/jan/13/gamergate-hits-new-low-with-attempts-to-send-swat-teams-to-critics | title=Gamergate hits new low with attempts to send SWAT teams to critics | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=13 January 2015 | accessdate=26 September 2016 | author=Hern, Alex}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quinn said the launch of Crash Override Network led to a renewed and heightened campaign of abuse, and the website underwent daily hack attempts.&lt;ref name=telegraph /&gt; In May 2015 the organisation became an official [[Twitter]] trusted safety resource.&lt;ref name=ars20150520 /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10346">[[File:Cross - Sant'Apollinare in Classe - Ravenna 2016.jpg|thumb|Detail of a mosaic, [[Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe]], Ravenna (549).]]
A '''''crux gemmata''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for: '''jewelled cross''') is a form of [[Christian cross|cross]] typical of [[Early Christian art and architecture|Early Christian]] and Early [[Medieval art]], where the cross, or at least its front side, is principally decorated with jewels. In an actual cross, rather than a painted image of one, the reverse side often has engraved images of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]] or other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;As on the Cross of Lothair. The Cross of Justin II has silver [[repoussé]] figures on the reverse.&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples in metalwork are the [[Cross of Justin II]] (6th century, in the [[Vatican Museums]]), the 'crumpled cross' in the [[Staffordshire Hoard]] (8th century), the [[Cross of Lothair]] (10th century, [[Aachen Cathedral Treasury]]), the Iberian [[Cross of the Angels]] and [[Victory Cross]], and the [[Cross of Cong]] (1120s?, [[National Museum of Ireland]]).

==History of use==
In the [[Late Antique]] and Early Medieval periods, many objects of great significance, such as [[reliquaries]], were studded with jewels in a style that in recent centuries has been restricted to crowns and other [[coronation regalia]] and small pieces of [[jewellery]]. In the case of the cross, such decorative embellishment was especially common, and the jewelled cross is a specific type that was represented in paint, [[mosaic]], carved [[ivory]] and other media. The cross very often has splayed ends to its arms, but the proportions of the vertical axis to the horizontal one depends entirely on the needs of the composition, and varies greatly. [[Pendilia]], or hanging jewels or ornaments, may hang from the arms, especially the letters [[alpha and omega]] shaped in gold. The motif is first seen in a [[sarcophagus]] fragment from the late 4th century; the splayed ends of the arms are present from the earliest examples.&lt;ref&gt;Hellemo, 100-101. Lateran sarcophagus number 106 is the earliest work.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aachen Germany Domschatz Cross-of-Lothair-01.jpg|thumb|The front side of the [[Cross of Lothair]] (ca. 1000 AD)]]
In depictions of the cross, such as that in the mosaic in [[Santa Pudenziana]], Rome (384–9), the jewelled cross stands on a hill or mound with a backdrop of a panoramic view representing [[Jerusalem]], with the cross itself representing the [[New Jerusalem]] or "heavenly city".&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 104 and 139–140&lt;/ref&gt; The jewelled cross also served as a symbol of the Christian version of the [[Tree of Life]], especially when the arms are shown putting out shoots from their corners. The Staffordshire Hoard 'crumpled cross' has vine leaves showing at the corners and represents Jesus the vine. It is sometimes shown on a mound representing [[paradise]], with four rivers flowing down it (the four rivers were understood as representing the [[Four Gospels]]);&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 104; see Hellemo 93, note for an example of the four rivers symbolism.&lt;/ref&gt; a stepped base represents the hill in actual crosses or more confined depictions. The link of the cross generally with the Tree of Life appears frequently in the hymns of [[Venantius Fortunatus]].&lt;ref&gt;Wernher, 37&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp (2016) has shown the interlace on the front of the Staffordshire Hoard cross corresponds with the river or tree of life described in Revelation 22. 1-2.

For much of the period, a large jewelled cross is recorded as decorating the presumed site of the Crucifixion, around which the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]] had been built. It was presented by the [[Eastern Emperor]] [[Theodosius II]] (reigned 408–450).&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, 10; Wernher, 36 has further details&lt;/ref&gt; The crux gemmata first appears after what was believed to be the finding of the [[True Cross]] by the [[Helena (Empress)|Empress Helena]], mother of [[Constantine I|Constantine]] in the early 4th century, when interest in the cross greatly increased. The paradox whereby the instrument of execution is rendered the vehicle of Christ's triumph in the [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]] remains to the present day a central theme in Christian devotion, and the jewelled cross was one of its first visual manifestations.&lt;ref&gt;Friesen, 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it is clear that the cross was associated with Christians from a very early period, and the [[sign of the cross]] was made by Christians, it is rarely seen in the earliest Christian art, such as that in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], where there are only about 20 crosses, though the [[anchor]], which appears more commonly, was a disguised cross symbol.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 103–104&lt;/ref&gt; There was resistance to representations of the cross with the body of Christ on it, a practice that did not begin until the 5th century, becoming more common in the 6th.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 106–108&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest representations of a Crucifixion scene rather oddly shows the three crosses of the gospel accounts, with the two thieves hanging in place on theirs, but with Christ standing at the foot of his. The fierce [[Christology|Christological]] disputes of the period saw the [[Monophysites]], who rejected the human nature of Christ, objecting to the depiction of his body on the cross, and this influenced the use of the empty cross, especially in Byzantine-controlled areas such as [[Ravenna]], where several of the Emperors had Monophysite sympathies. It was the [[Nestorianism|Nestorians]], another [[heresy|heretical]] force of the opposite persuasion, who helped to popularize images of Christ on the cross.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 108 and 145-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In so-called "mystical" images, such as the apse mosaic at the [[Basilica of Sant' Apollinare in Classe]], Ravenna (549), the jewelled cross stands specifically as a symbol for Christ.&lt;ref&gt;See Syndicus, 139–140 and Schiller, I, 148 for slightly different interpretations in detail&lt;/ref&gt; A poem by St [[Paulinus of Nola]] allows a reconstruction of a mosaic apse he had (as bishop) commissioned in the basilica of St [[Felix of Nola]] at [[Cimitile]] in the early 5th century.&lt;ref&gt;Much of the basilica survives, but not the decorations.&lt;/ref&gt; The whole [[Trinity]] was shown, represented by a [[Hand of God (art)|Hand of God]] for [[God the Father]] at the top, above a large crux gemmata with stars in a circular frame, so very similar to Sant' Apollinare in Classe, and below that a dove for the [[Holy Spirit]]. At the bottom of the [[semi-dome]] were twelve lambs, six on each side, with a haloed [[Lamb of God]] on a raised hillock in the centre, looking up. The bottom of the mosaic at Santa Pudenziana in Rome originally also had a bottom level with this.&lt;ref&gt;Syndicus, 138-9, with drawing reconstructing the Nola apse. For much more detail, see Hellemo, 90ff&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solidus Marcian RIC 0509.jpg|thumb|A gold [[Solidus (coin)|solidus]] of [[Marcian]], 450–457.]]

The crux gemmata is commonly seen on coins, often held by a figure of Victory, especially in the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;See Hellemo, 98-101 for the interplay between imperial imagery of victory and the earliest images of the cross&lt;/ref&gt; Another common Byzantine coin type shows a cross with a stepped base, which should be understood as a ''crux gemmata'' even though scale does not normally allow any indication of gems.

[[File:The Curmsun Disc - Reverse.png|thumb|Victory Cross at the reverse of the [[Curmsun Disc]], Wolin, 980s]]

Contrary to the assertion of [[Dan Brown]] in ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 4.&lt;/ref&gt; it is not especially typical for a cross to have thirteen gems, though when one does, it probably does symbolize [[Jesus Christ|Christ]] and His twelve [[Twelve Apostles|apostles]]. The apse mosaic in the [[Basilica of Saint Paul Outside the Walls]] (c. 1220) has an example with thirteen jewels, but examples from the first millennium generally have more. It is not usual to use the term "crux gemmata" for crosses from more recent periods, especially for small crosses that fall under the category of jewellery.

      <comment>since the lead was not citing a source and seems a bit confusing, I rewrote it with two sources about that "dervish" is commonly held in classical Islamic literature (such as performing miracles). I didn't know about dervishes leading Tariqa. further a dervish is not necessarily part of an order (just like the first source states). Further they are not always "poor". dervishes of cervish orders often had political positions and earned money by advising the Sultan.</comment>

==Etymology==
{{Sufism}}{{Sunni Islam}}
[[File:A Pakistani Punjabi Dervish.jpg|thumb|left|180px|A [[Pakistan]]i Dervish at [[Tulamba]] (May 2008).]]

The Persian word ''darvīsh'' ({{lang|fa|درویش}}) is of ancient origin and descends from a [[Proto-Iranian]] word that appears in [[Avestan]] as {{nobreak|''drigu-'',}} "needy, [[mendicant]]", via Middle Persian ''driyosh.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/darvis |title=Encyclopædia Iranica &amp;#124; Articles |publisher=Iranicaonline.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iranian word is probably a [[cognate]] with the [[Vedic Sanskrit]] word {{nobreak|''adhrigu-'',}} an [[epithet]] of uncertain meaning applied to several deities. The Vedic word is probably to be analysed as {{nobreak|''a-dhrigu-'',}} that is "not {{nobreak|''dhrigu-'',"}} perhaps "not poor", i.e., "rich." The existence of this Vedic cognate suggests that the institution of the holy mendicant was as prominent among the ancient [[Indo-Iranians|Indo-Iranian]] people as it has been historically in later Iran in the form of dervish brotherhoods, and also in India in the form of the various schools of [[sannyasi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_go2081/is_2_122/ai_n7042986/?tag=content;col1 | work=The Journal of the American Oriental Society | title=Adhrigu and drigu: on the semantics of an old Indo-Iranian word | first=George | last=Thompson | year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because the etymology of the word is not apparent from the point of view of the modern Persian language, there have been attempts to make the parts of the word interpretable in terms of contemporary words and with reference to Sufic mystical concepts. ''Der'', spelt as ''dar'' before 1964 ([[Dari language]]), means "door" in [[Persian language|Persian]]; ''dervish'' has been interpreted as "one who goes from door to door".&lt;ref name=islam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Angelus á S. Joseph: Gazophylacium linguae Persarum, triplici linguarum clavi, Italicae, Latinae  […] [https://books.google.com/books?id=-CIBwuRw0AEC&amp;pg=PA297], Amsterdam, 1684, Pg 6, 199&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian word also gives terms for "ascetic" in some languages, as in the [[Urdu]] phrase ''darveshaneh tabi'at'', "an unflappable or ascetic temperament". According to the [[Bundahishn]] ''dervish'' or ''darwesh'' means "visitor from many doors". The term is a composition of the word ''der'' or ''dar'' and the adjective ''wish'' or ''wesh'' ويش or وش ''vsh'' (much, more), and means "someone who goes from door to door and sings, gets money, and wakes the people". This word is outdated in Persian, but it exists in the Indo-Iranian language of [[Pashto]] as ''wesh zalmanyan'' or ''wish zalmayan'', meaning "awakened youth".&lt;ref&gt;Ferdinand Justi:Der Bundeshesh, zum ersten Male, herausgegeben, transcribiert, übersetzt und mit Clossar versehen, Leipzig,1868 [https://archive.org/stream/derbundeheshher00unkngoog#page/n9/mode/1up], Pg. 139, 262, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious practice==
[[File:Preziosi - Derviş cerşetor.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A dervish.]]
Many dervishes are mendicant ascetics who have taken a vow of poverty, unlike [[mullah]]s. The main reason they beg is to learn humility, but dervishes are prohibited to beg for their own good. They have to give the collected money to other poor people. Others work in common professions; Egyptian [[Qadiriyya]] – known in Turkey as Kadiri – are fishermen, for example.

Some classical writers indicate that the poverty of the dervish is not merely economic. [[Saadi (poet)|Saadi]], for instance, who himself travelled widely as a dervish, and wrote extensively about them, says in his ''[[Gulistan of Sa'di|Gulistan]]'':
{{Quotation|Of what avail is frock, or rosary,
Or clouted garment? Keep thyself but free&lt;br&gt;
From evil deeds, it will not need for thee&lt;br&gt;
To wear the cap of felt: a darwesh be&lt;br&gt;
In heart, and wear the cap of Tartary.&lt;ref&gt;chapter 2 story 16: [https://archive.org/stream/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog/gulistnorrosega00eastgoog_djvu.txt "The Gulistān; or, Rose-garden, of Shek̲h̲ Muslihu'd-dīn Sādī of Shīrāz, translated for the first time into prose and verse, with an introductory preface, and a life of the author, from the Ātish Kadah"] a story later adapted by La Fontaine for his tale 'Le songe d'un habitant du Mogol'&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Rumi]] writes in Book 1 of his [[Masnavi]]:&lt;ref&gt;''The Masnavi: Book One'', translated by Jawid Mojaddedi, Oxford World's Classics Series, Oxford University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-19-955231-3}}, p63.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|Water that's poured inside will sink the boat&lt;br&gt;
                     While water underneath keeps it afloat.&lt;br&gt;
Driving wealth from his heart to keep it pure&lt;br&gt;
King Solomon preferred the title 'Poor':&lt;br&gt;

==Whirling dervishes==
{{Main|Sufi whirling}}
[[File:Whriling dervishes, Rumi Fest 2007.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[Whirling dervishes]], Rumi Fest 2007]]
The whirling dance or [[Sufi whirling]] that is proverbially associated with dervishes is best known in the West by the practices (performances) of the [[Mevlevi]] order in Turkey, and is part of a formal ceremony known as the [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]. It is, however, also practiced by other orders. The Sama is only one of the many Sufi ceremonies performed to try to reach [[religious ecstasy]] (''majdhb'', ''fana''). The name ''Mevlevi'' comes from the [[Persian language|Persian]] poet [[Jalal ad-Din Muhammad Rumi|Rumi]], who was a dervish himself. This practice, though not intended as entertainment, has become a tourist attraction in Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Koentges|first=Chris|title=13 Things The Whirling Dervishes Can Teach You About Spinning Until You’re Dizzy Enough To Puke|url=http://veryethnic.wordpress.com/2012/06/29/13-things-the-whirling-dervishes-can-teach-you-about-spinning-until-youre-dizzy-enough-to-puke/|publisher=The Very Ethnic Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;B.

==Orders==
[[File:Turkey.Konya050.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Dervish mannequins (Mevlâna mausoleum, [[Konya, Turkey]])]]
There are various orders of dervishes, almost all of which trace their origins from various Muslim saints and teachers, especially [[Ali ibn Abi Talib|Imam Ali]]. Various orders and suborders have appeared and disappeared over the centuries. Dervishes spread into [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], [[Turkey]], the [[Balkans]], the [[Caucasus]], [[Iran]], [[Pakistan]], [[India]], [[Afghanistan]], and [[Tajikistan]].

Other dervish groups include the [[Bektashi]]s, who are connected to the [[Janissary|janissaries]], and the [[Senussi]], who are rather orthodox in their beliefs. Other fraternities and subgroups chant verses of the [[Qur'an]], play drums or [[Sema|whirl]] in groups, all according to their specific traditions. They practice [[meditation]], as is the case with most of the Sufi orders in [[South Asia]], many of whom owe allegiance to, or were influenced by, the [[Chishti]] order. Each [[fraternity]] uses its own garb and methods of acceptance and initiation, some of which may be rather severe.

==Somali Dervish movement==
{{main|Dervish movement (Somali)}}
The [[Dervish movement (Somali)|Dervish movement]] was an early 20th-century [[Somalis|Somali]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Islamic state]] that was established by [[Mohammed Abdullah Hassan]], a religious leader who gathered Somali soldiers from across the [[Horn of Africa]] and united them into a loyal army known as the ''Dervishes''. This Dervish army enabled Hassan to carve out a powerful state through conquest of lands claimed by the Somali [[Sultan]]s, the [[People of Ethiopia|Ethiopians]] and the [[Europe]]an powers. The Dervish movement acquired renown in the [[Islamic world|Islamic]] and [[West world|Western]] worlds due to its resistance against [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and [[Italy]]. The Dervish movement successfully repulsed British-led Somali and Ethiopian forces four times and forced them to retreat to the coastal region.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of African history - Page 1406&lt;/ref&gt; The polity also maintained relations with other authorities, receiving support from the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[German empire]]s. The [[Turkish people|Turks]] also named Hassan [[Emir]] of the Somali nation,&lt;ref&gt;I.M. Lewis, ''The modern history of Somaliland: from nation to state'', (Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson: 1965), p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[German people|Germans]] promised to officially recognize any territories the Dervishes were to acquire.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas P. Ofcansky, Historical dictionary of Ethiopia, (The Scarecrow Press, Inc.: 2004), p.405&lt;/ref&gt; The Dervish movement was finally [[Somaliland campaign (1920)|defeated by the British in 1920]].

==Other historical uses==

===Mahdists===
Various western historical writers have sometimes used the term ''dervish'' rather loosely, linking it to, among other things, the [[Muhammad Ahmad|Mahdist uprising]] in [[Sudan]] and other rebellions against [[colonialism|colonial]] powers. In such cases, the term "dervishes" may have been used as a generic (and often pejorative) term for the opposing Islamic entity and all members of its military, political and religious institutions, including persons who would not be considered "dervishes" in the strict sense.

For example, a contemporary British drawing of the fighting in Sudan was entitled "The defeat of the dervishes at Toski" (see [[History of Sudan (1884–1898)#British response]]).

In his source, as in ''[[Mother Hulda]]'', the kind girl was the stepdaughter, not the other daughter. The change was apparently to decrease the similarity to ''[[Cinderella]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Iona and Peter Opie]], ''The Classic Fairy Tales'', p 100 {{ISBN|0-19-211559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is [[Aarne-Thompson classification system|Aarne-Thompson]] tale 480, the kind and the unkind girls. Others of this type include ''[[Shita-kiri Suzume]]'', ''[[Mother Hulda|Frau Holle]]'', ''[[The Three Heads in the Well]]'', ''[[Father Frost (fairy tale)|Father Frost]]'', ''[[The Three Little Men in the Wood]]'', ''[[The Enchanted Wreath]]'', ''[[The Old Witch]]'', and ''[[The Two Caskets]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Heidi Anne Heiner, [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/diamondstoads/other.html "Tales Similar to Diamonds and Toads"]&lt;/ref&gt; Literary variants include ''[[The Three Fairies]]'' and ''[[Aurore and Aimée]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 543, {{ISBN|0-393-97636-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
A bad-tempered old widow had two daughters; her older daughter, Fanny was disagreeable and proud, but looked and behaved like her mother, and therefore was her favorite child; her [[Youngest son#Sibling pairs|younger daughter]], Rose was sweet, gentle, and beautiful, but resembled her late father. Jealous and bitter, the widow and her favourite daughter abused and mistreated the younger girl.

One day while drawing water from the well, an old woman asked the younger girl for a drink of water. The girl politely consented and after giving it, she found that the woman was a [[fairy]], who had taken the guise of a [[crone]] to test the character of mortals. As the girl was so kind and compassionate toward her, the fairy blessed her with having either a jewel, a precious metal, or a pretty flower fall from her mouth whenever she spoke.

Upon arriving home and explaining why she took so long to her mother, the widow was delighted at the sight of [[precious metal]]s, [[Gemstone|jewels]] and [[flower]]s falling from the girl's lips, and desired that her favored eldest daughter, Fanny, should have the gift as well. Fanny protested, but the widow forcibly sent her to the well with instruction to act kindly toward an old beggar woman. Fanny set off but the fairy appeared as a fine [[princess]], and requested that the girl draw her a drink from the well. The elder daughter spoke rudely to the fairy and insulted her. The fairy decreed that, as punishment for her despicable attitude, either a toad or a snake would fall from Fanny's mouth whenever she spoke.

When Fanny arrived home, she told her story to her mother and disgusting [[toad]]s and [[Viperidae|viper]]s fell from her mouth with each word. The widow, in a fury, drove her younger daughter out of the house. In the woods, she met a king's son, who fell in love with her and married her. In time, even the widow was sickened by her older daughter, and drove her out, and she died alone and miserable in the woods.

==Commentary==
The idea of having jewels fall from a virtuous person is a motif found in various other tales, as in the Italian ''[[Biancabella and the Snake]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Iona and Peter Opie, ''The Classic Fairy Tales'', p 98 {{ISBN|0-19-211559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Masaccio-TheExpulsionOfAdamAndEveFromEden-Restoration.jpg|thumb|330px|''The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden'', before and after restoration.]]
'''''The Expulsion from the Garden of Eden''''' ({{lang-it|'''Cacciata dei progenitori dall'Eden'''}}) is a [[fresco]] by the Italian Early Renaissance artist [[Masaccio]]. The fresco is a single scene from the cycle painted around 1425 by Masaccio, [[Masolino da Panicale|Masolino]] and others on the walls of the [[Brancacci Chapel]] in the church of [[Santa Maria del Carmine di Firenze|Santa Maria del Carmine]] in [[Florence]]. It depicts [[Fall of Man|the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden]], from the biblical [[Book of Genesis]] chapter 3, albeit with a few differences from the canonical account.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;

==Possible sources of inspiration==
Many possible sources of inspiration have been pointed out that Masaccio may have drawn from. For Adam, possible references include numerous sculptures of [[Marsyas]] (from [[Greek Mythology]]) and certain [[crucifixes|crucifix]] done by [[Donatello]].

For Eve, art analysts usually point to different versions of [[Venus Pudica]], such as ''Prudence'' by [[Giovanni Pisano]].

==Cover up and restoration==

Three centuries after the fresco was painted, [[Cosimo III de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo III de' Medici]], in line with contemporary ideas of [[decorum]], ordered that [[Fig leaf|fig leaves]] be added to conceal the [[genitals]] of the figures.  These were eventually removed in the 1980s when the painting was fully restored and cleaned.&lt;ref name="smarth"/&gt;
[[File:Cappella brancacci, cacciata.JPG|left|thumb|The scene in its context in the chapel.]]

==Influence on Michelangelo==
Masaccio provided a large inspiration to the more famous Renaissance painter [[Michelangelo]], due to the fact that [[Michelangelo]]'s teacher, [[Domenico Ghirlandaio]], looked almost exclusively to him for inspiration for his religious scenes. Ghirlandaio also imitated various designs done by Masaccio. This influence is most visible in Michelangelo's ''The Fall of Man and the Expulsion from the Garden of Eden'' on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Differences from Genesis==
The main points in this painting that deviate from the account as it appears in Genesis:

# Adam and Eve are shown in the nude. Although this increases the drama of the scene, it differs from Genesis 3:21 ([[KJV]]) which states, "Unto Adam also and to his wife did the {{LORD}} God make coats of skins, and clothed them."
# Only one [[Cherub]] angel is present. Genesis 3:24 states, "So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims&lt;!--SIC--&gt;, [...]" (''-im'' being the original Hebrew plural ending of Cherub, doubled with an English plural in this version).
# The arch depicted at the garden entrance does not appear in the Biblical account.

However, since artists often followed the studio tradition, painting from previous versions of a scene--and so learning from and absorbing other artists' expressive inventions into their own work--any responsible iconographic study would founder in the shallows of literal expectation if the painting were only judged by its adherence to these details and therefore seen to be successful only if it functioned as a simple illustration for the scene. 

Masaccio's evocation of Eve's howling, deeply felt pain in particular explores the meaning of the expulsion on a previously unexamined, more personal level.

In 2nd Temple Jewish texts, however, Adam is described as glorious (''Sirach'' 49, ''&amp;c.''), and in both some Rabbinic and Christian Patristic sources, there is a long tradition of reading the Hebrew word for "skin" as "light" (there is only one slight difference in the vowels between the two words), and taking the Genesis 3:21 words about God clothing the pair in the Pluperfect sense, such as Sebastian Brock has shown is done in the Syriac tradition. In Rabbinic sources there are several times when Adam is compared and contrasted with Moses, particularly in terms of Moses' luminosity after ascending the mountain, and at least one text where Moses claims that his glory is greater than Adam's, because he did not lose his glory (Deuteronomy Rabbah 11:3); Genesis Rabbah 20:12 notes that Rabbi Meir had a scroll that had "light" instead of skin. The same tradition is found in Ephrem the Syrian, who, in his ''Hymns on Paradise'' 6, talks about Christ clothing the faithful in the robe that Adam lost with the transgression. The Canon of St. Andrew of Crete has the cantor liken himself to Adam, and say "I have found myself stripped naked of God". The Venerable Bede, in his commentary ''On Genesis'', has similar comments: "having lost the glory of innocence by their transgression, they claimed for themselves the garment of an excuse". The "stripped of divinity/glory/innocence/honor motif is thus found in the Latin, Greek, and Syriac traditions of the Church. It seems quite possible that these artists were working within this very old tradition that stretches across traditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5514">'''Extra-illustration''' is the process whereby texts, normally in their published state, are customized by the incorporation of thematically linked prints, watercolors, and other visual materials.&lt;ref name=Ashmolean&gt;{{cite web|title=Extra-illustration (also known as ‘Grangerization’)|url=http://sutherland.ashmolean.museum/Grangerization.shtml|publisher=[[Ashmolean]]|accessdate=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Extra-illustration was a vibrant and widespread fashion in Britain and America during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. While there was no set canon of titles chosen for extra-illustration, certain themes and subjects occur repeatedly. From the 1770s to the 1830s, most of the books selected were patriotic in tone and antiquarian or historical in subject. Titles ranged from biography, county histories, and topography to travel, natural history, and Shakespeare. As the pastime became more popular, the genre became more diverse but the scope remained the same: places and people, chronicles of contemporary life, the lives of artistic and theatrical celebrities, and a variety of then-modern writers, notably Byron and Dickens.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
In Britain, extra-illustration is frequently called "Grangerising" or "Grangerisation," after [[James Granger]] whose seminal book ''Biographical History of England from Egbert the Great to the Revolution''—published in 1769 without illustrations—quickly prompted a fashion for portrait-print collecting and the incorporation prints and drawings into the printed text. However, the term "Grangerising" only came into use from the 1880s, more than a century after Granger's death.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt; And ironically for the process of book customization that carries his name, Granger never "grangerized" a book.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Jackson, ''Marginalia: Readers Writing in Books'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001): pp. 186-87.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Page from James Granger illustrated by A. M. Storer.jpg|thumb|Page from [[James Granger]]'s ''Biographical History'', extra-illustrated by [[Anthony Morris Storer]] with prints of Edward III dating to the 17th and 18th centuries. [[Eton College]] Library.]]

==Leading examples==
There are many examples of extra-illustration, especially Granger's ''Biographical History''.&lt;ref&gt;The history of the practice is given in [[Lucy Peltz]], ''Facing the Text: Extra-Illustration, Print Culture, and Society in Britain, 1769-1840''. San Marino, California: [[Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens]], 2017. Distributed in the UK by [[Manchester University Press]]. [http://www.manchesteruniversitypress.co.uk/9780873282611/]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first and certainly the most influential example was made by [[Richard Bull (MP)]] who corresponded regularly with James Granger about his print collection and its organisation according to Granger's typologies.&lt;ref&gt;Their letters are preserved at Eton and published entire in [[Lucy Peltz]], "Engraved Portrait Heads and the Rise of Extra-illustration: The Eton Correspondence of the Revd James Granger and Richard Bull, 1769–1774," ''Walpole Society'' 66 (2004), pp. 1–161, see http://www.walpolesociety.org.uk/publications/publications.php retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bull-Granger, as Richard Bull's extra-illustrated copy is often called, is now in the collection of the [[Huntington Library]] in California. A large collection of extra-illustrated books was formed during the same period by [[Anthony Morris Storer]] who bequeathed them to [[Eton College]] in 1799. In the [[British Museum]], a particularly impressive and early example is the copy of ''Some Account of London'' by [[Thomas Pennant]], extra-illustrated by [[John Charles Crowle]]. Crowle filled fourteen folio volumes, bound in gold-tooled red leather, with a collection of over 3347 prints and drawings of London topography and of portrayals of historical events and people connected with the history of London. It was bequeathed to the British Museum in 1811 where it is registered under number G,1.1.&lt;ref&gt;See https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=3316454&amp;partId=1&amp;images=true&amp;museumno=G,1.1&amp;page=1 Retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the largest project in the genre are the extra-illustrated books and related materials produced by Alexander Hendras Sutherland and his wife Charlotte, née Hussey, between c.1795 and 1839. The Sutherland collection is now shared between the [[Ashmolean Museum]] and the [[Bodleian Library]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sutherland.ashmolean.museum/intro.shtml Retrieved 03 January 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Feminist Art Program''' (FAP) was a college-level art program for women developed in 1970 by artist [[Judy Chicago]] and continued by artists Rita Yokoi, [[Miriam Schapiro]], and others. The FAP began at Fresno State College, as a way to address gender inequities in art education, and the art world in general. In 1971, [[Judy Chicago]] and [[Miriam Schapiro]] brought the FAP to the newly formed [[California Institute of the Arts]], leaving Rita Yokoi to run the Fresno FAP until her retirement in 1992. The FAP at [[California Institute of the Arts]] was active until 1976. The students in the Feminist Art Program read women writers, studied women artists, and made art about being a woman based on group consciousness raising sessions. Often, the program was separate from the rest of the art school to allow the women to develop in a greenhouse-like environment and away from discerning critiques.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While the separatist ideology has been critiqued as reinforcing gender, the FAP has made a lasting impression on feminist art which can be seen in retrospectives, group exhibitions, and creative re-workings of the original projects.

== Fresno Feminist Art Program ==
The original Feminist Art Program was developed by artist [[Judy Chicago]]. The first such program was launched in the fall of 1970 at Fresno State College, now [[California State University, Fresno]]. In the spring of 1971, It became a full 15-unit program. This was the first feminist art program in the United States. Fifteen students studied under Chicago at Fresno State College: Dori Atlantis, Susan Boud, Gail Escola, [[Vanalyne Green]], [[Suzanne Lacy]], Cay Lang, [[Karen LeCocq]], Jan Lester, Chris Rush, Judy Schaefer, Henrietta Sparkman, [[Faith Wilding]], Shawnee Wollenman, [[Nancy Youdelman]], and Cheryl Zurilgen.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"/&gt; Together, as the Feminist Art Program, these women rented and refurbished an off-campus studio at 1275 Maple Avenue in downtown [[Fresno, California|Fresno]]. Here they collaborated on art, held reading groups, and discussion groups about their life experiences which then influenced their art.

The Fresno Feminist Art Program served as a model for other feminist art efforts, such as [[Womanhouse]], a collaborative feminist art exhibition and the first project produced after the Feminist Art Program moved to the California Institute of the Arts in the fall of 1971. [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville|Sheila de Bretteville]] and [[Arlene Raven]] also taught in that program. Womanhouse, like the Fresno project, also developed into a feminist studio space and promoted the concept of collaborative women's art.&lt;ref name="Fresno1" /&gt;

After Chicago left for [[California Institute of the Arts|CalArts]], the class at Fresno State College was continued by Rita Yokoi from 1971 to 1973, and then by [[Joyce Aiken]] in 1973, until her retirement in 1992.{{#tag:ref|Aiken opened the all-women's [[co-op]] Gallery 25 with her students, developed the Fresno Art Museum's Council of 100 and the Distinguished Women Artist Series, which helped develop programming and exhibitions about women at the museum.&lt;ref name="Fresno1"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Dr. Laura Meyer |author2=Nancy Youdelman | year= | title=A Studio of Their Own: The Legacy of the Fresno Feminist Art Experiment | work=A Studio of their Own | publisher= | url=http://www.astudiooftheirown.org/legacy.html | accessdate=8 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}}

==Feminist Art Program (FAP) at CalArts==
Later, Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] reestablished the Feminist Art Program (FAP) at [[California Institute of the Arts]].

The Feminist Art Program (FAP) was created by Judy Chicago and [[Miriam Schapiro]] at the California Institute of the Arts in [[Valencia, California]], in 1971. Building on the "radical educational techniques" that she had first tried out in her classes for women in 1970{{ndash}}1971, when she worked at Fresno State, Chicago and Schapiro made the program, the first of its kind accessible to women only. Chicago in particular felt she had to "redo" her education as an art historian, since she had been taught by men exclusively and considered that this background forced a male perspective on her as an artist and disallowed her from developing her "own forms, artistic language, and subject matter".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harper|first=Paula|year=1985|title=The First Feminist Art Program: A View from the 1980s|journal=[[Signs (journal)|Signs]]|volume=10|issue=4|pages=762–81|jstor=3174313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist Studio Workshop==
The Feminist Studio Workshop was founded in Los Angeles in 1973 by Judy Chicago, [[Arlene Raven]], and [[Sheila Levrant de Bretteville]] as a two-year feminist art program. Women from the program were instrumental in finding and creating the [[Woman's Building]], the first independent center to showcase women's art and culture.

'''Generative art''' refers to [[art]] that in whole or in part has been created with the use of an autonomous system. An autonomous system in this context is generally one that is non-human and can independently determine features of an artwork that would otherwise require decisions made directly by the artist. In some cases the human creator may claim that the [[Generative systems|generative system]] represents their own artistic idea, and in others that the system takes on the role of the creator.

"Generative art" often refers to [[algorithmic art]] (algorithmically determined computer generated artwork), but artists can also make it using systems of [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[mechanics]] and [[robotics]], [[smart materials]], manual [[randomization]], [[mathematics]], [[data mapping]], [[symmetry]], [[Tessellation|tiling]], and more.

== History ==

The use of the word "generative" in the discussion of art has developed over time. The use of "[[Artificial DNA]]" defines a generative approach to art focused on the construction of a system able to generate unpredictable events, all with a recognizable common character. The use of [[autonomous robot|autonomous systems]], required by some contemporary definitions, focuses a generative approach where the controls are strongly reduced. This approach is also named "emergent". [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds have noted the use of the term "generative art" in the broad context of automated computer graphics in the 1960s, beginning with artwork exhibited by [[Georg Nees]] and [[Frieder Nake]] in 1965:&lt;ref name="Boden"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Boden, Margaret |author2=Edmonds, Ernest |author1link=Margaret Boden |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/233128802_What_is_generative_art |title=What is Generative Art? |journal=Digital Creativity |date=2009 |volume=20 |issue=1/2 |pages=21–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 {{quotation | The  terms  "generative art"  and  "computer  art"  have been  used  in  tandem,  and  more  or  less interchangeably, since the very earliest days.&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;}}

The first such exhibition showed the work of Nees in February 1965, which some claim was titled "Generative Computergrafik".&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; While Nees does not himself remember, this was the title of his doctoral thesis published a few years later.&lt;ref name=Nake12&gt;{{cite web |last=Nake |first=Frieder |title=Georg Nees: Generative Computergrafik |url=http://dada.compart-bremen.de/node/3280 |publisher=University of Bremen |accessdate=19 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The correct title of the first exhibition and catalog was "computer-grafik".&lt;ref&gt;Ness, Georg; Bense, Max: ''computer-grafik''; Edition Rot 19; Stuttgart, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; "Generative art" and related terms was in common use by several other early computer artists around this time, including [[Manfred Mohr]].&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; The term "Generative Art" with the meaning of dynamic artwork-systems able to generate multiple artwork-events was clearly used the first time for the "Generative Art" conference in Milan in 1998.

The term has also been used to describe geometric [[abstract art]] where simple elements are repeated, transformed, or varied to generate more complex forms. Thus defined, generative art was practised by the Argentinian artists Eduardo McEntyre and Miguel Ángel Vidal in the late 1960s. In 1972 the Romanian-born Paul Neagu created the Generative Art Group in Britain. It was populated exclusively by Neagu using aliases such as "Hunsy Belmood" and "Edward Larsocchi." In 1972 Neagu gave a lecture titled 'Generative Art Forms' at the [[Queen's University, Belfast]] Festival.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ed. ''The Oxford Companion to Twentieth-Century Art'', Oxford ; New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walker, J. A. ''Glossary of art, architecture, and design since 1945 (3rd ed.)'', London; Boston: Library Association Publishing; G.K. Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970 the [[School of the Art Institute of Chicago]] created a department called "Generative Systems." As described by [[Sonia Landy Sheridan]] the focus was on art practices using the then new technologies for the capture, inter-machine transfer, printing and transmission of images, as well as the exploration of the aspect of time in the transformation of image information.&lt;ref&gt;Sheridan, Sonia Landy. ''Generative Systems versus Copy Art: A Clarification of Terms and Ideas'', Leonardo, 16(2), 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Clauser &lt;ref&gt;Clauser, H. R. ''Towards a Dynamic, Generative Computer Art'', Leonardo, 21(2), 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; identified the aspect of systemic autonomy as a critical element in generative art:

 {{quotation | It should be evident from the above description of the evolution of generative art that process (or structuring) and change (or transformation) are among its most definitive features, and that these features and the very term 'generative' imply dynamic development and motion. ...

(the result) is not a creation by the artist but rather the product of the generative process - a self-precipitating structure. }}

In 1989 Celestino Soddu defined the Generative Design approach to Architecture and Town Design in his book ''Citta' Aleatorie''.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C.  Citta' Aleatorie, Masson Publisher 1989 "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/cittaaleatorie_book.htm]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989 Franke referred to "generative mathematics" as "the study of mathematical operations suitable for generating artistic images."&lt;ref&gt;Franke, H. W.''Mathematics As an Artistic-Generative Principle'', Leonardo, Supplemental Issue, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1990s [[Brian Eno]] popularized the terms [[generative music]] and generative systems, making a connection with earlier [[experimental music]] by [[Terry Riley]], [[Steve Reich]] and [[Philip Glass]].&lt;ref&gt;Eno, B. ''[http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/eno1.html  Generative Music]'', In Motion Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

From the end of the 20th century, communities of generative artists, designers, musicians and theoreticians began to meet, forming cross-disciplinary perspectives.  
The first meeting about generative Art was in 1998, at the inaugural International Generative Art conference at Politecnico di Milano University, Italy.&lt;ref&gt;Soddu, C. and Colabella, E. ed.s "[http://www.artscience-ebookshop.com/ga98_book.htm Generative Art]", Dedalo&lt;/ref&gt; 
In Australia, the Iterate conference on generative systems in the electronic arts followed in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csse.monash.edu.au/~iterate/FI/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;  
On-line discussion has centred around the eu-gene mailing list,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120727083144/http://generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene |archivedate=2012-07-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which began late 1999, and has hosted much of the debate which has defined the field.&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;{{rp|1}}  These activities have more recently been joined by the [http://www.generatorx.no/generatorx-introduction/ Generator.x] conference in Berlin starting in 2005.
In 2012 the new journal GASATHJ, Generative Art Science and Technology Hard Journal was founded by Celestino Soddu and Enrica Colabella &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasathj.com  GASATHJ]&lt;/ref&gt; jointing several generative artists and scientists in the Editorial Board.

Some have argued that as a result of this engagement across disciplinary boundaries, the community has converged on a shared meaning of the term.  As Boden and Edmonds&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt; put it in 2011:

{{quotation | Today, the term "Generative Art" is still current within the relevant artistic community. Since 1998  a series  of  conferences  have been  held  in Milan with  that  title (Generativeart.com), and Brian Eno has been inﬂuential in promoting and using generative art methods (Eno, 1996). Both in music and in visual art, the use of the term has now converged on work that has been produced by the activation of a set of rules and where the artist lets a computer system take over at least some of the decision-making (although, of course, the artist determines the rules).}}

In the call of the Generative Art conferences in Milan (annually starting from 1998), the definition of Generative Art by Celestino Soddu:

{{quotation | Generative Art is the idea realized as genetic code of artificial events, as construction of dynamic complex systems able to generate endless variations. Each Generative Project is a concept-software that works producing unique and non-repeatable events, like music or 3D Objects, as possible and manifold expressions of the generating idea strongly recognizable as a vision belonging to an artist / designer / musician / architect /mathematician.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.generativeart.com Generative Art]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Discussion on the eu-gene mailing list was framed by the following definition by [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] from 1999:

{{quotation | Generative art is a term given to work which stems from concentrating on the processes involved in producing an artwork, usually (although not strictly) automated by the use of a machine or computer, or by using mathematic or pragmatic instructions to define the rules by which such artworks are executed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000901084825/http://www.generative.net/mailman/listinfo/eu-gene eu-gene mailing list welcome page]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A similar definition is provided by Philip Galanter:&lt;ref name="Galanter2003" /&gt;
{{quotation | Generative art refers to any art practice where the artist creates a process, such as a set of natural language rules, a computer program, a machine, or other procedural invention, which is then set into motion with some degree of autonomy contributing to or resulting in a completed work of art.}}

==Types==

===Music===
{{Main article|Generative music}}
[[Johann Philipp Kirnberger]]'s "[[Musikalisches Würfelspiel]]" (Musical Dice Game) 1757 is considered an early example of a generative system based on randomness. Dice were used to select musical sequences from a numbered pool of previously composed phrases. This system provided a balance of order and disorder. The structure was based on an element of order on one hand, and disorder on the other.&lt;ref name="Algorithmic"&gt;Nierhaus, Gerhard (2009). ''Algorithmic Composition: Paradigms of Automated Music Generation'', pp. 36 &amp; 38n7. {{ISBN|9783211755396}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fugues]] of [[J.S. Bach]] could be considered generative, in that there is a strict underlying process that is followed by the composer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=Tim|title=Fugue 9: E Major. Well-Tempered Clavier, book 1. The Fugue is Generative|url=http://bach.nau.edu/clavier/nature/fugues/Fugue09.html|publisher=NAU.edu|accessdate=28 November 2017|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[serialism]] follows strict procedures which, in some cases, can be set up to generate entire compositions with limited human intervention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Lerdahl|Lerdahl, Fred]]. 1988. "Cognitive Constraints on Compositional Systems". In ''Generative Processes in Music'', ed. John Sloboda. Oxford University Press. Reprinted in ''Contemporary Music Review'' 6, no. 2 (1992):97–121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lerdahl, Fred, and [[Ray Jackendoff]]. 1983. ''A Generative Theory of Tonal Music''. MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Composers such as [[John Cage]],&lt;ref name="Paul"&gt;[[Christiane Paul (curator)|Christiane Paul]] ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|13–15}} [[Farmers Manual]] and [[Brian Eno]]&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|133}} have used [[generative systems]] in their works.

===Visual art===
The artist [[Ellsworth Kelly]] created paintings by using chance operations to assign colors in a grid. He also created works on paper that he then cut into strips or squares and reassembled using chance operations to determine placement.&lt;ref&gt;Yve-Alain Bois, Jack Cowart, Alfred Pacquement ''Ellsworth Kelly: The Years in France, 1948-1954'', Washington DC, National Gallery of Art, Prestel, p. 23-26&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Calmoduline Monument.jpg|thumb|''Calmoduline Monument'', by [[Jean-Max Albert]], 1991]]

Artists such as [[Hans Haacke]] have explored processes of physical and social systems in artistic context.  
[[François Morellet]] has used both highly ordered and highly disordered systems in his artwork.  Some of his paintings feature regular systems of radial or parallel lines to create [[Moiré Patterns]]. In other works he has used chance operations to determine the coloration of grids.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm Tate Online Article] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325054818/http://www.tate.org.uk/tateetc/issue16/colourchart3.htm |date=2012-03-25 }} about [[François Morellet]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grace Glueck "Francois Morellet, Austere Abtractionism", New York Times, Feb. 22, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sol LeWitt]] created generative art in the form of systems expressed in [[natural language]] and systems of geometric [[permutation]]. [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]'s [[AARON]] system is a longstanding project combining software artificial intelligence with robotic painting devices to create physical artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurzweilcyberart.com/aaron/hi_cohenbio.html Biography of Harold Cohen] [[Harold Cohen (artist)|Harold Cohen]]&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[Steina and Woody Vasulka]] are video art pioneers who used analog video feedback to create generative art. Video feedback is now cited as an example of deterministic chaos, and the early explorations by the Vasulkas anticipated contemporary science by many years.
Software systems exploiting [[evolutionary computing]] to create visual form include those created by [[Scott Draves]] and [[Karl Sims]].
The digital artist [[Joseph Nechvatal]] has exploited models of viral contagion.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Wands ''Art of the Digital Age'', London: Thames &amp; Hudson, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; 
''Autopoiesis'' by [[Ken Rinaldo]] includes fifteen musical and [[robotic]] sculptures that interact with the public and modify their behaviors based on both the presence of the participants and each other.&lt;ref name="Paul"/&gt;{{rp|144–145}}
[[Jean-Pierre Hebert]] and [[Roman Verostko]] are founding members of the [[Algorists]], a group of artists who create their own algorithms to create art.
[[Michael Noll|A. Michael Noll]], of Bell Telephone Laboratories, Incorporated, programmed computer art using mathematical equations and programmed randomness, starting in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;A. Michael Noll, “The Digital Computer as a Creative Medium,” IEEE Spectrum, Vol. 4, No. 10, (October 1967), pp. 89-95; and “Computers and the Visual Arts,” Design and Planning 2: Computers in Design and Communication (Edited by Martin Krampen and Peter Seitz), Hastings House, Publishers, Inc.: New York (1967), pp. 65-79.&lt;/ref&gt;
The French artist [[Jean-Max Albert]], beside environmental sculptures like ''Iapetus'',&lt;ref&gt;Michel Ragon, Jean-Max Albert «Iapetus», L’art abstrait vol.5, Éditions Maeght, Paris, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; and ''O=C=O'',&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Max Albert O=C=O, Franco Torriani, Dalla Land arte alla bioarte, Hopefulmonster editore Torino, 2007, p. 64-70&lt;/ref&gt; developed a project dedicated to the vegetation itself, in terms of biological activity. The ''Calmoduline Monument'' project is based on the property of a protein, [[calmodulin]], to bond selectively to calcium. Exterior physical constraints (wind, rain, etc.) modify the electric potential of the cellular membranes of a plant and consequently the flux of calcium. However, the calcium controls the expression of the calmoduline gene.&lt;ref&gt;Intra-and Intercellular Communications in Plants, Millet &amp; Greppin Editors, INRA, Paris, 1980, p.117.&lt;/ref&gt; The plant can thus, when there is a stimulus, modify its « typical » growth pattern. So the basic principle of this monumental sculpture is that to the extent that they could be picked up and transported, these signals could be enlarged, translated into colors and shapes, and show the plant’s « decisions » suggesting a level of fundamental biological activity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books/about/L_espace_de_profil.html?id=PAlPAAAAYAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y ''Space in profile/ L'espace de profil,'']&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maurizio Bolognini]] works with generative machines to address conceptual and social concerns.&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Bolognini, ''De l'interaction à la démocratie. Vers un art génératif post-digital''  ([http://www.bolognini.org/lectures/amx.htm From interactivity to democracy.

[[Mark Napier (artist)|Mark Napier]] is a pioneer in data mapping, creating works based on the streams of zeros and ones in ethernet traffic, as part of the "Carnivore" project. [[Martin M. Wattenberg|Martin Wattenberg]] pushed this theme further, transforming "data sets" as diverse as musical scores (in "Shape of Song", 2001) and Wikipedia edits ([[History Flow]], 2003, with [[Fernanda Viegas]]) into dramatic visual compositions.
The Canadian artist [[San Base]] developed a "Dynamic Painting" algorithm in 2002. Using computer algorithms as "brush strokes," Base creates sophisticated imagery that evolves over time to produce a fluid, never-repeating artwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sanbasestudio.com/about.htm San Base: About]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software art===
{{Main article|Software Art}}
For some artists, graphic user interfaces and computer code have become an independent art form in themselves. [[Adrian Ward (artist)|Adrian Ward]] created Auto-Illustrator as a commentary on software and generative methods applied to art and design.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

===Architecture===
In 1987 [[Celestino Soddu]] created the artificial DNA of Italian Medieval towns able to generate endless [[3D computer graphics|3D]] models of cities identifiable as belonging to the idea.&lt;ref&gt;Celestino Soddu [http://www.soddu.it/progetti/med.htm Soddu: "Italian Medieval Town"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Literature===
{{further information|Oulipo|The Eureka|Electronic literature|Spam Lit|Informationist poetry|Language game|Prehistoric Digital Poetry}}

Writers such as [[Tristan Tzara]], [[Brion Gysin]], and [[William Burroughs]] used the [[cut-up technique]] to introduce randomization to literature as a generative system. [[Jackson Mac Low]] produced computer-assisted poetry and used algorithms to generate texts; [[Philip M. Parker#Automatically generated books|Philip M. Parker]] has written software to automatically generate entire books. [[Jason Nelson]] used generative methods with Speech-to-Text software to create a series of digital poems from movies, television and other audio sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Flores |first1=Leonardo |title=The Battery Life of Meaning: Speech to Text Poetry” |url=http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |website=I love E-Poetry |accessdate=9 February 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704155151/http://iloveepoetry.com/?p=324 |archivedate=4 July 2013 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live coding===
{{Main article|Live coding}}
Generative systems may be modified while they operate, for example by using interactive programming environments such as [[Max/MSP]], [[vvvv]], [[Fluxus (programming environment)|Fluxus]], [[Isadora (software)|Isadora]], [[Quartz Composer]] and [[openFrameworks]]. This is a standard approach to programming by artists, but may also be used to create live music and/or video by manipulating generative systems on stage, a performance practice that has become known as [[live coding]]. As with many examples of [[software art]], because live coding emphasises human authorship rather than autonomy, it may be considered in opposition to generative art.&lt;ref name=McLean11&gt;{{cite book |last=McLean |first=Alex |title=Artist-Programmers and Programming Languages for the Arts |year=2011 |publisher=Goldsmiths, University of London (PhD Thesis)|pages=16–17 |url=http://yaxu.org/writing/thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories==

===Philip Galanter===

In the most widely cited theory of generative art, in 2003 Philip Galanter&lt;ref name="Galanter2003"&gt;Philip Galanter [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/ga2003_what_is_genart.pdf ''What is Generative Art? Complexity theory as a context for art theory''], 2003 International Conference on Generative Art&lt;/ref&gt; describes generative art systems in the context of complexity theory. In particular the notion of [[Murray Gell-Mann]] and [[Seth Lloyd]]'s [[effective complexity]] is cited. In this view both highly ordered and highly disordered generative art can be viewed as simple. Highly ordered generative art minimizes [[entropy]] and allows maximal [[data compression]], and highly disordered generative art maximizes entropy and disallows significant data compression. Maximally complex generative art blends order and disorder in a manner similar to biological life, and indeed biologically inspired methods are most frequently used to create complex generative art. This view is at odds with the earlier [[information theory]] influenced views of [[Max Bense]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Max Bense|Bense, Max]] ''Aesthetica; Einfuehrung in die neue Aesthetik'', Agis-Verlag&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Abraham Moles]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Abraham Moles|Moles, Abraham]]. ''Information theory and esthetic perception'', University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; where complexity in art increases with disorder.

Galanter notes further that given the use of visual symmetry, pattern, and repetition by the most ancient known cultures generative art is as old as art itself. He also addresses the mistaken equivalence by some that rule-based art is synonymous with generative art. For example, some art is based on constraint rules that disallow the use of certain colors or shapes. Such art is not generative because constraint rules are not constructive, i.e. by themselves they don't assert what is to be done, only what cannot be done.&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/vague_terrain_2006.pdf ''Generative art and rules-based art.''], Vague Terrain (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Margaret Boden and Ernest Edmonds===

In their 2009 article, [[Margaret Boden]] and Ernest Edmonds agree that generative art need not be restricted to that done using computers, and that some rule-based art is not generative. They develop a technical vocabulary that includes Ele-art (electronic art), C-art ([[computer art]]), D-art (digital art), CA-art (computer assisted art), G-art (generative art), CG-art (computer based generative art), Evo-art (evolutionary based art), R-art (robotic art), I-art (interactive art), CI-art (computer based interactive art), and VR-art (virtual reality art).&lt;ref name="Boden" /&gt;
&lt;!--
In both accounts the term generative art does not describe an [[art movement]], [[ideology]], or theory of [[aesthetics]]. The term refers to how the art is made, and does not take into account why it was made or what the content of the artwork is.--&gt;&lt;!--this is WP:OR, an editor's opinion--&gt;

=== Questions ===

The discourse around generative art can be characterised by the theoretical questions which motivate its development. McCormack et al. propose the following questions, shown with paraphrased summaries, as the most important:&lt;ref name=McC&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCormack |first=Jon |author2=Oliver Bown |author3=Alan Dorin |author4=Jonathan McCabe |author5=Gordon Monro |author6=Mitchell Whitelaw |title=Ten Questions Concerning Generative Computer Art |journal=Leonardo |year=forthcoming |url=http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121129225520/http://diotima.infotech.monash.edu.au/~jonmc/sa/news/ten-questions-concerning-generative-computer-art/ |archivedate=2012-11-29 |date=2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Can a machine originate anything?  ''Related to [[machine intelligence]] - can a machine generate something new, meaningful, surprising and of value: a poem, an artwork, a useful idea, a solution to a long-standing problem?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is it like to be a computer that makes art?  ''If a computer could originate art, what would it be like from the computer's perspective?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# Can human aesthetics be formalised?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What new kinds of art does the computer enable?  ''Many generative artworks do not involve digital computers, but what does generative computer art bring that is new?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# In what sense is generative art representational, and what is it representing?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What is the role of randomness in generative art? ''For example, what does the use of randomness say about the place of intentionality in the making of art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can computational generative art tell us about creativity? ''How could generative art give rise to artefacts and ideas that are new, surprising and valuable?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What characterises good generative art? ''How can we form a more critical understanding of generative art?''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What can we learn about art from generative art? ''For example, can the art world be considered a complex generative system involving many processes outside the direct control of artists, who are agents of production within a stratified global art market.''&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;
# What future developments would force us to rethink our answers?&lt;ref name=McC/&gt;

Another question is of postmodernism—are generative art systems the ultimate expression of the postmodern condition, or do they point to a new synthesis based on a complexity-inspired world-view?&lt;ref&gt;Galanter, Philip. [http://philipgalanter.com/downloads/complexism_chapter.pdf ''Complexism and the role of evolutionary art''] in "The art of artificial evolution : a handbook on evolutionary art and music", Springer&lt;/ref&gt;

A category of [[fine art]], '''graphic art''' covers a broad range of visual artistic expression, typically two-dimensional, i.e. produced on a flat surface.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;"[http://www.britannica.com/art/graphic-art Graphic art]." ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Britannica.com. Retrieved 2016-02-21.&lt;/ref&gt; The term usually refers to the arts that rely more on line or tone than on colour, especially [[drawing]] and the various forms of [[engraving]];&lt;ref name="Oxford"&gt;"Graphic art." ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art''. 3rd ed.  Ed. Ian Chilvers. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004. p. 309.&lt;/ref&gt; it is sometimes understood to refer specifically to [[printmaking]] processes,&lt;ref name="Oxford"/&gt; such as [[line engraving]],  [[aquatint]], [[drypoint]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]], [[monotyping|monotype]], [[lithography]], and [[screen printing]] (silk-screen, serigraphy).&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, Ralph (1992). "Graphic arts, or graphics." ''The HarperCollins Dictionary of Art Terms and Techniques''. 2nd ed. Revised and edited by Steven Sheehan. New York: Harper Perennial. p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; Graphic art further includes [[calligraphy]], [[photography]], [[painting]], [[typography]], [[computer graphics]], and [[bindery]]. It also encompasses drawn plans and layouts for interior and architectural designs.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

==History==
Throughout history, technological inventions have shaped the development of graphic art. In 2500 BC, the Egyptians used graphic symbols to communicate their thoughts in a written form known as [[hieroglyphics]]. The Egyptians wrote and illustrated narratives on rolls of papyrus to share the stories and art with others.&lt;ref name="Meggs"&gt;{{cite web|first=Philip B.|last=Meggs|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1032864/graphic-design |title=Graphic design|work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Britannica.com |date=2014-03-05 |accessdate=2016-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Middle Ages, scribes [[scriptorium|manually copied]] each individual page of manuscripts to maintain their sacred teachings. The scribes would leave marked sections of the page available for artists to [[illuminated manuscript|insert drawings and decorations]]. Using art alongside the carefully lettered text enhanced the religious reading experience.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"&gt;McGuire-Lyle, Erin.  ''Careers in the Graphic Arts and Computer Graphics'' (Career Resource Library). June 2000. New York: Rosen Publishing Group, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johannes Gutenberg]] invented an improved movable type mechanical device known as the [[printing press]] in 1450, the first outside of Asia. His printing press facilitated the mass-production of text and graphic art and eventually, replaced manual transcriptions altogether.

Again during the Renaissance years, graphic art in the form of printing played a major role in the spread of classical learning in Europe. Within these manuscripts, book designers focused heavily on [[typeface]].

Due to the development of larger fonts during the [[Industrial Revolution]], [[posters]] became a popular form of graphic art used to communicate the latest information as well as to advertise the latest products and services.

The invention and popularity of [[film]] and [[television]] changed graphic art through the additional aspect of motion as advertising agencies attempted to use kinetics to their advantage.

The next major change in graphic arts came when the personal [[computer]] was invented in the twentieth century. Powerful computer software enables artists to manipulate images in a much faster and simpler way than the skills of board artists prior to the 1990s. With quick calculations, computers easily recolor, scale, rotate, and rearrange images if the programs are known.&lt;ref name="Meggs"/&gt;

The scientific investigations into legibility has influenced such things as the design of street signs. New York City is in the process of changing out all of its street signs bearing all capital letters for replacement with signs bearing only upper and lower case letters. They estimate that the increased legibility will facilitate way-finding and reduce crashes and injuries significantly.

[[File:Vacation Rentals In Hawaii Image.jpg|thumb|Example of graphic arts created with the free tool, Paint.net.]]
Graphic artists applying for positions in today's job market are expected to be familiar with computers and a variety of software programs in order to create the most appealing, up to date designs.

Graphic art software includes applications such as:
*[[Adobe Dreamweaver]] – a tool that facilitates the creation of webpages and dynamic internet content
*[[Adobe Illustrator]] – an application that allows artists to manipulate vector graphics
*[[Adobe InDesign]] – desktop publishing software used for layout and design manipulation
*[[Adobe Photoshop]] – a bitmap graphics software including powerful graphics editing tools that provide a large variety of editing functionality
*[[CorelDRAW]] – similar to Adobe Illustrator, it is another vector graphic manipulation tool
*[[PhotoImpact]] – a digital photograph editor
*[[QuarkXPress]] – similar to Adobe InDesign, it is another computer publishing software tool

===Free software===
*[[Paint.net]] – photograph editing capabilities with lots of plugins to expand use
*[[GIMP]] – similar to paint.net and Photoshop
*[[Inkscape]] – similar to Illustrator

Beside computers and software, graphic artists are also expected to be creative with processing camera work, registration, crop marks, and masking.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt;

== Careers ==
{{howto|date=October 2013}}
One of the most common career paths for a graphic artist today is web design. With the popularity of the [[World Wide Web]], the demand for web designers is immense. Graphic artists use their creativity with layouts, typography, and [[logos]] to market the products or services of the client’s business. In addition to creating graphical designs, graphic artists also need to understand hypertext, web programming, and web page maintenance in order to successfully create a web page.&lt;ref name="McGuire-Lytle"/&gt; The responsibility for effective communication also falls under the auspices of the graphic designer.

The '''Greek New Testament''' is the original form of the books that make up the [[New Testament]] as they appeared in [[Koine Greek]], the common dialect from 300 BC to 300 AD. There are several Greek-language versions of the New Testament that approximate the original form of the New Testament books in Greek. The first published edition of the Greek New Testament was produced by [[Erasmus]] in 1516. There are multiple Greek copies of the New Testament [[Byzantine text-type]]s, used by the Greek Orthodox Church. There exist multiple copies of the New Testament ''[[Textus Receptus]]'', the basis of the King James Bible of the New Testament. 

Modern translations of the Greek New Testament are mostly based on the ''[[Novum Testamentum Graece]]'', which is the [[Eberhard Nestle|Nestle]]-[[Kurt Aland|Aland]] versions of the Greek New Testament, currently in its 28th revision, abbreviated NA28. These versions of the Greek New Testament come primarily from the [[Alexandrian text-type]] manuscripts and fragments in place of the Byzantine or Textus Receptus Koine Greek text, in an effort begun by [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton Hort]] (1828–1892).

Greek text versions are used as the basis for most modern copyrighted English translations of the New Testament, with their chief foundations being:

* the New Testament text of the [[Codex Sinaiticus]], an Alexandrian text-type manuscript version of the Bible written in the 4th century in [[uncial]] letters on parchment, which lacks many passages found in the Byzantine text-type and Textus Receptus; and
* the New Testament of the [[Codex Vaticanus]] an Alexandrian text-type manuscript version of the Bible, which ends at Hebrews 9:14 and does not have many passages found in the Byzantine text-type and Textus Receptus.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3205">The '''Handicraft Guild''' was an organization central to [[Arts and Crafts movement]] active in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], United States, from 1904 to 1918. The Handicraft guild was founded, led, and staffed primarily by women, making it historically significant to women's art movements nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cartwright|first=R. L.|title=Handicraft Guild|url=http://www.mnopedia.org/group/handicraft-guild|work=[[MNopedia]]|publisher=Minnesota Historical Society|date=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to creating stone and metal art works, the Guild was an egalitarian school with the mission "[to] give authoritative instruction in design and its solution in terms of materials; also to furnish complete training for students desirous of becoming Craftsmen, Designers and Teachers."  Its pupils included [[Grant Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Handicraft Guild was revived after the turn of the 21st century and is a leading influence on the [[Arts in Minneapolis]].

The [[Handicraft Guild Building]] is located at 89 10th Street South, Minneapolis, Minnesota and still stands today thanks to the efforts of the [[Minneapolis Heritage Preservation Commission]].

'''''It's Like, You Know...''''' is an American [[sitcom]] television series broadcast by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. It starred [[Steven Eckholdt]], [[Chris Eigeman]], [[Evan Handler]], [[A. J. Langer]], and [[Jennifer Grey]], and depicted life in Los Angeles as viewed through the eyes of Eigeman's character, a diehard New Yorker named Arthur Garment. The series aired for two seasons, from March 24, 1999 until January 5, 2000.

==Synopsis==
The show sought to lampoon an upper class Los Angeles lifestyle, in part by presenting the Manhattan writer, Garment, as a fish out of water among Hollywood notables and the idle rich.  In the pilot his character arrives with unconcealed hostility, intent on treating his readers to a bitter satire on the absurdities and excesses of LA culture.  While staying with an old friend from college, Garment finds himself increasingly torn between button-down stern contempt for West Coast attitudes and a growing enchantment with the relaxed whimsy constantly swirling around him.

The show was also notable for featuring the actress Jennifer Grey playing herself, the source of a running joke related to her real-life [[rhinoplasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Huff, Richard |date=March 28, 1999 |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-03-28/entertainment/18101411_1_mehlman-nose-jennifer-grey

==Broadcast==
When ABC canceled the series, seven episodes remained unaired (six episodes from the planned second season, in addition to the original unaired pilot). These episodes have since aired abroad, including in [[Argentina]] on [[Fox Latin America]] and in Australia on [[The Comedy Channel]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Reception==
Ratings for the series were low, due in part to the sudden explosion of reality programming and ABC's decision to dedicate much of its primetime schedule to the then-popular ''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire (US game show)|Who Wants to Be a Millionaire]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12352">'''Myrlande Constant''' is a Haitian and [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]] artist who was born in 1968. Constant is married and the mother of four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indigoarts.com/artist/myrlande-constant|title=Myrlande Constant|last=|first=|date=October 26, 2015|website=Indigo Arts|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Constant was born in [[Port-au-Prince]] in [[Haiti]] where, as a teenager, she learned the art of beading while working with her mother in a Port-au-Prince factory making wedding dresses. Once she quit that job she moved on to be one of the most celebrated artists for making Vodou drapo.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"&gt;Donald J.Cosentino, and Edwidge Danticat, ''In Extremis: Death and Life in 21st-century Haitian Art,'' (Los Angeles, CA: Fowler Museum at UCLA, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p.183}} Constant has taken part in the revolution in the art of drapo-making over the last two decades. She has been making flags since the 1900s. Since the 1900s, there was an abrupt shift in drapo-making, which was primarily a male art form. There are several new designers who are women now, one of them being Myrlande Constant. Because of the impact that Constant has on other people, she influences art making in other individuals, in particular [[Marilyn Houlberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald J. Cosentino, "Bicentennial blues," ''African Arts'' 37, no. 3 (2004), 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Constant bears witness to her nation's calamities. For example, after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010, the artwork Myrlande made represented the collectivistic society through the things that were going on at the time.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.20}}

Her works are densely beaded flags (some as large as six by seven feet). Constant’s flags are much larger than traditional flags. In 2011, Constant participated in a series of exhibitions, workshops, and lectures at [[Brown University]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]] where she conducted a three-day flag-making workshop.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.183}}

== Principal expositions and works ==
Myrlande Constant had her first sale to Richard A Morse, who was the manager of the Oloffson Hotel in Port-au-Prince. Other subsequent sales of her outstanding Vodou flags were made through the connections of her husband, Charles, who convinced customers and visitors at the hotel to buy her work. Many of Constant’s inspiration of her artwork came from her father who is a Vodou priest and Christian. She states that she has no one to thank but the spirits and God before the spirits. She additionally states that the mystical feelings and aspirations come from her thoughts.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}} Everything she puts on a flag is there for a reason because the spirit keeps her working. Constant is also inspired by Milo Rigaud’s landmark book called ''Veve''. This book contains symbolic drawings of spirits made on Vodou temple floors. Constant uses that inspiration to remember her memories of Vodou ceremonies and knowledge of the spirits to create her own design in the flags.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}}

The main process of the making of her flags starts with pencil drawings on white cloth. Second, she sews the sequins and beads to the cloth. Lastly, she incorporates the colors that associate with the spirits. Typically, most of her works are as large as bedspreads depicting various significant events in Vodou and Haitian history through using needle, thread, cloth, and tiny adornments.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.185}}

Constant is particularly a well known Haitian and Vodou artist in many parts of the world. Specifically, her piece of the 2010 Haiti earthquake apocalypse was recognized as an immediate potential for becoming one of the 2011 Ghetto Biennale Exhibition in [[New York (state)|New York]]’s most extreme and powerful artistic visions.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.9}}

'''''Haiti madi 12 januye 2010''''' (Haiti Tuesday, January 12, 2010)

239 x 249 cm

Private collection

This piece of artwork is made with fabric, beads, and sequins. Myrlande Constant’s tableau depicts the ruins and aftermath of the 2010 earthquake. It was funded by the [[Fowler Museum at UCLA|Fowler Museum]] with funds provided by the Fay Bettye Green Fund to Commission New Work. This piece makes the viewer feel the need to study the miseries and disasters that happen in the human life. The chaoticness of the imagery resembles how chaotic the actual event was in 2010. The visual characteristics include a border of crossbones and skulls, and angels and God looking down on the situation resembling the prophet Ezekiel’s vision of dry bones: “The hand of the Lord was on me, and he brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord and set me in the middle of the valley, it was full of bones. [[Ezekiel]] 37:1).” Other aspects of this piece include homes, churches, and vodou temples all being reduced to rubble. Dogs and pigs gnaw on the unburied unprotected human remains. The Catholic Archbishop Serge Miot, who is a man of [[God]], lies dead under the fallen roof of his cathedral with a hand on a bible. Other individuals in the piece are shown as Vodouists who either carry a child in their arms, or wheelbarrow the dead and wounded to the appropriate destinations as a summoning mortal to the hand of their maker in the call of Gabriel. More individuals either pick up the ruins, or sink to the ground as if remaining upright on solid earth is not an option. Constant’s piece depicted a meaning that explained the suffering as ultimately, just as with life, letting death go on. Looking forward to Ash Wednesday being faithful, and having anticipation on Eastertide’s Resurrection were things that Constant reminded the victims of. The victims were shown “Remember that thou art dust, and to dust thou shalt return”. And so, too the Gede will rise up to their feet, shake off the dirt, adjust their glasses, straighten their hats, grab their canes and crutches, and dance.&lt;ref name="Donald J 2012"/&gt;{{rp|p.141}}

{{History of Northern Nigeria}}
The '''Nok culture''' is an early [[Iron Age]] population whose material remains are named after the [[Ham people|Ham]] village of [[Nok]] in [[Kaduna State]] of [[Nigeria]], where their famous [[terracotta]] sculptures were first discovered in 1928. The Nok Culture appeared in [[northern Nigeria]] around 1500 BC &lt;ref name="PB 2014"&gt;Breunig, Peter. 2014. Nok: African Sculpture in Archaeological Context: p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and vanished under unknown circumstances  around 500 AD, thus having lasted approximately 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="FB 1969"&gt;Fagg, Bernard. 1969. Recent work in west Africa: New light on the Nok culture. World Archaeology 1(1): 41–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iron use, in [[smelting]] and [[forging]] for tools, appears in Nok culture by at least 550 BC and possibly earlier. Data from historical linguistics suggest that iron smelting was independently discovered in the region prior to 1000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan E. Miller and N.J.

The function of Nok terracotta sculptures is still unknown. For the most part, the terracotta is preserved in the form of scattered fragments. That is why Nok art is well known today only for the heads, both male and female, whose hairstyles are particularly detailed and refined. The statues are in fragments because the discoveries are usually made from [[alluvium|alluvial mud]], in terrain made by the erosion of water. The terracotta statues found there are hidden, rolled, polished, and broken. Rarely are works of great size conserved intact making them highly valued on the international art market.

The terracotta figures are hollow, coil built, nearly life sized human heads and bodies that are depicted with highly stylized features, abundant [[jewellery|jewelry]], and varied postures.

Little is known of the original function of the pieces, but theories include ancestor portrayal, [[grave marker]]s, and [[amulet|charms]] to prevent crop failure, infertility, and illness. Also, based on the dome-shaped bases found on several figures, they could have been used as finials for the roofs of ancient structures.

Margaret Young-Sanchez, Associate Curator of Art of the Americas, Africa, and Oceania in [[The Cleveland Museum of Art]], explains that most Nok ceramics were shaped by hand from coarse-grained clay and subtractively sculpted in a manner that suggests an influence from wood carving. After some drying, the sculptures were covered with slip and burnished to produce a smooth, glossy surface. The figures are hollow, with several openings to facilitate thorough drying and firing. The firing process most likely resembled that used today in Nigeria, in which the pieces are covered with grass, twigs, and leaves and burned for several hours.

As a result of natural erosion and deposition, Nok terracottas were scattered at various depths throughout the Sahel grasslands, causing difficulty in the dating and classification of the mysterious artifacts. Luckily, two archaeological sites, [[Samun Dukiya]] and [[Taruga]], were found containing Nok art that had remained unmoved. [[Radiocarbon dating|Radiocarbon]] and [[Thermoluminescence dating|thermo-luminescence]] tests narrowed the sculptures’ age down to between 2,000 and 2,500 years ago, making them some of the oldest in Western Africa. Many further dates were retrieved in the course of new archaeological excavations, extending the beginnings of the Nok tradition even further back in time.&lt;ref name="BP 2014" /&gt;

Because of the similarities between the two sites, archaeologist [[Graham Connah]] believes that "Nok artwork represents a style that was adopted by a range of iron-using farming societies of varying cultures, rather than being the diagnostic feature of a particular human group as has often been claimed."

==Discovery==

The first Nok terracotta was discovered in 1928 by Colonel Dent Young, a co-owner of a mining partnership, near the village of [[Nok]] on the [[Jos Plateau]] in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;Chesi, G. &amp; Merzeder, G. (2006). The Nok Culture: Art in Nigeria 2500 Years Ago&lt;/ref&gt; The terracotta was accidentally unearthed at a level of 24 feet from an alluvial tin mine. Young presented the sculptures to the museum of the Department of Mines in [[Jos]].&lt;ref name="ST 1981"&gt;Shaw, Thurstan. 1981. The Nok sculptures of Nigeria. Scientific American 244(2): 154–166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fifteen years later, in 1943 near the village of [[Nok]], in the center of Nigeria, a new series of clay figurines were discovered by accident while mining [[tin]]. A clerk in charge of the mine had found a head and had taken it back to his home for use as a [[scarecrow]], a role that it filled (successfully) for a year in a [[yam (vegetable)|yam]] field. This scarecrow was eventually noticed by [[Bernard Fagg]] who at the time was an administrative officer who had studied archaeology at the University of Cambridge. Fagg noticed that the head on the scarecrow looked similar to the sculpture that Young had found. He traveled to [[Jos]] where Young showed Fagg other recently uncovered [[terracotta]] figures. Eventually it became clear that the tin mining in Nok and [[Jema'a]] areas were revealing and destroying archaeological material.&lt;ref name="ST 1981" /&gt;

Preliminary excavations at the beginning of January 1961 began near a remote valley named [[Taruga]] near the village of Takushara. The trial excavations took place during a period of eight days. The finds included objects of [[wrought iron]], a quantity of iron slag, fragments of [[tuyere]], pottery, figurine fragments, [[red ocher]], [[quartz]] hammer-stones, and small concentrations of [[charcoal]]. The most famous finds at the site were the pottery graters which were shallow, flat-bottomed dishes which were deeply scored inside with diced patterns to produce a sharp abrasive surface. These pottery graters were probably used for food preparation. In the preliminary excavation a [[proton magnetometer]] survey was used to try and locate furnaces. The survey revealed a total of 61 magnetic anomalies which were mostly located in a flat, central area which probably indicated the limits of actual occupation. Twenty of the anomalies revealed concentrations of [[slag]] and nine of them contained [[in situ]] structures of furnace walls and bases. The most common type of artefact found was domestic pottery which can be divided into two different types. One type are bowls or shallow basins without lips and the other are globular pots which have averted lips. Because of this preliminary excavation, the Nok Culture would start being regarded as belonging to the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="FB 1969" /&gt;

==Archaeology==
In 1989, German scientists were working in northeastern Nigeria's Chad Basin as part of a cooperative project between the [[University of Maiduguri]] located in [[Borno State]], Nigeria, and archaeologists of [[Goethe University Frankfurt]]. This project examined the beginnings of sedentary farming societies in the [[Chad Basin]]. Questions arose about whether there were other societies like those in the Chad Basin, and these questions led the team to investigate the Nok Culture. In the early steps of the Frankfurt Nok Project, researchers had difficulty finding sites to excavate. The team began collaborating with Umaru Yusuf Potiskum and they started finding distinct Nok culture sites, although most were looted.&lt;ref name="AMV"&gt;Breunig, Peter (editor). 2014. Nok: African sculpture in archaeological context. Africa Magna Verlag, Germany, October 15.&lt;/ref&gt; A few sites, however, were still intact, and artefacts found at these sites are described below.

===Stone tools===

The shapes of stone tools found at Nok sites change little throughout the entire span of the Nok Culture. What tends to strike researchers is a lack of cutting tools. Apart from stone axes, no tools with a cutting edge have been found. [[Projectile point]]s made of either iron or stone are also absent from Nok sites.

Grinding tools are very common at Nok sites. They are rarely preserved in one piece, but can still illustrate the different shapes and sizes of tools used throughout the Nok Culture. Grinding stones were made of [[quartzite]], [[Granite|granitic]], or [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] rock. At the site of Ungwar Kura, grinding stones seem to have been placed in a certain order, and at the site of Ido huge grinding slabs were arranged in an upright position with pots and stone beads next to them. This context is assumed to have been ritual in some way. Most of the grinders are merely hand-sized. Throughout Nok sites, there is an abundance of grinding slabs but there seems to be a low number of hand stones. It is possible that members of the Nok Culture used these grinders until they reached a certain state of wear, and then repurposed them as pestles.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

Ground stone axes were another tool commonly used by the Nok.  They were typically made from fine-grained volcanic rock (siliceous rock is also sometimes seen), and may have been used in food preparation. These ax blades tend to be smallish in size, the largest reaching 20 centimeters.  Stone balls are found at almost every Nok site and are approximately palm-sized. They were probably used as hammerstones or for roughening the surface of a grinding stone. Not all of them are ball shaped, however, and many have chipping marks all over or at least in one place. These stone balls likely would have served as mobile grinding stones.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

Stone rings have also been found at Nok Culture sites. They are normally found as fragments, but can be identified as rings because of their flat, oval or triangular cross-sections and their shapes. These stone rings are very rare and their purpose is unknown. Another rare find is stone beads, which are typically found as if strung on strings. Beads tend to be carefully made out of hard siliceous rock such as [[quartz]], [[chalcedony]], [[jasper]], or [[carnelian]]. There are three different bead shapes: cylindrical, which is the most common shape, as well as rod and ring-shaped.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

===Ceramics===
Potsherds (pottery shards) are the most abundant archaeological artefacts at Nok sites. Since 2009, excavated pottery has been undergoing systematic analysis with a central aim to try and establish a chronology. Certain attributes of the pottery such as decoration, shape and size appear with an increasing frequency and then disappear, being replaced with different pottery attributes. This change can sometimes allow one to divide the progression into different intervals based on the different attributes. In total approximately 90,000 potsherds have been collected, of which 15,000 have been considered diagnostic, meaning that they are decorated, sherds from the rim or the bottom of the vessel, or they have handles or holes in them. The results of the pottery analysis can be delineated into three distinct time periods: Early, Middle, and Late.

====Early Nok Period ceramics====
From approximately c. 1500–900 BC the pottery of the Early Nok Period are mostly small and not very well preserved. They seem to be richly decorated with various elaborate patterns directly below the vessels' rims and covering a large part of the ceramic body. The lines made on the pottery seem to be remarkably fine or curving lines. There tend to be many lines which are close together and some even have criss-crossing lines beneath the rim. Pottery frequently had everted and broad, thick rims.

====Middle Nok Period ceramics====
The Middle Nok Period is approximately from c. 900–300 BC and in this time period there is a dramatic increase of sites, terracotta fragments and iron objects. Instead of the early period's decoration, which tended to cover most of the pot, instead there is a decorative band which is bordered by deep horizontal lines. This band appears on the pots' upper half or directly under the rim of the bowls. Some bands have a sharp ends as well as impressed zigzag lines or an incised wave or arc. Unlike the Early Nok period the Middle Nok ceramics tend to have more variety in the rim with everted rims, open bowls, bowls with inverted rims and incised line ornaments on the rims' lips.

====Late Nok Period ceramics====
The Late Nok period is from approximately c. 300–1 BC and has only a few known sites. There is little pottery available for analysis but from the pottery that was found there is a decrease in the strictness of the ornamental band. While bands are still used, they are more complexly decorated with additional patterning. There also tends to be a returning pattern of body decoration. The variety of rim sizes and types seem to be increasing even more than in the Middle Nok period.

===Farming===

====Grains====
At almost all Nok sites there are charred plant remains consisting of firewood and plant material for cooking. Remains of [[pearl millet]], one of Africa's oldest grain crops, are commonly found. Pearl millet is highly productive and resistant to adverse growing conditions, including drought. [[Cowpea]]s, valued for their high protein content, are also found at some sites. So far, pearl millet and cowpeas are the only crops known to have been cultivated by the Nok people. It is unclear whether they ate or farmed tubers of any kind. The numerous grinding stones found at Nok sites suggest that the grains were ground into flour and made into a type of porridge.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

====Fruit====
Hard pits from wild fruits have been found at many Nok sites. At some sites, fruit and seeds of other wild plants such as grasses and [[legumes]] were discovered. Overall there is not a huge selection of plant remains, but this could simply mean they were not preserved.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

====Trees and farming====
The Nok people probably used an [[agroforestry]] system, combining cultivated crops with useful trees on the same plot of land. These plots are ecologically sustainable and inter-cropping of trees and several cultivated plant species were common from the savannas to the rain forest, with the origins of the practice going back to the first millennium BC, right at the time of the Nok culture. Most West African trees are not domesticated but are part of the wild vegetation which is left after farmers clear their fields of their crops. Because they are left to grow they multiply naturally without needing to be planted. Trees can produce food, medicine and animal feed.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

====Animals====
Because of the acidic soil, no animal bones from the Nok culture have been preserved, leaving no direct evidence of what species they might have domesticated (or hunted). The only evidence for animals during the Nok culture period is the depictions of animals as figurines or terracotta sculptures.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

== Looting and repatriation ==

Since the 1970s, Nok terracotta figures have been heavily looted. Even larger-scale [[looting]] commenced in the Nok cultural area in 1994, and by 1995 two main local traders emerged. Each of the main traders could employ approximately 1,000 diggers to unearth terracottas every day. Although the majority of the terracottas were fragmented, some were intact and sellable.&lt;ref name="BNDY"&gt;Brodie, Neil, and Donna Yates. 2012. Nok Terracottas. Trafficking Culture: Researching the Global Traffic in Looted Cultural Objects.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, hundreds of Nok Culture sites have been illegally dug in search of these terracotta sculptures. Valuable information about the Nok Culture is lost when these objects are taken from out of the ground and removed from their archaeological contexts.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

In 1979, Nigeria's National Commission of Museums and Monuments Decree established the [[National Commission for Museums and Monuments]] (NCMM), which is used to manage Nigeria's cultural heritage. NCMM Decree number 77 made it illegal for anyone other than authorized personnel to buy or sell antiquities within Nigeria or export an antiquity without a permit from the NCMM.&lt;ref name="BNDY" /&gt; Towards the end of the 1990s the federal government of Nigeria implemented the NCMM, which initiated a series of actions to work out strategies for combating the problems of looting and to map out a plan of action. The general consensus was that laws governing antiquities and penalties for offenders needed to be strictly enforced and that all archaeological sites should be monitored. The NCMM also recommended more aggressive public enlightenment campaigns as well as a series of sensitization programs across the nation. These programs are considered a success in terms of increased awareness by law enforcement agents, as well as the Nigerian customs authorities and [[Interpol]].&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt; However, not all of the recommendations were implemented, because the Nigerian government did not have the resources to face the enormity of some of the challenges. For example, the government did not have the resources to place monitors at all archaeological sites, and terracotta figures still slip through Nigeria's borders.

Today, the terracotta sculptures are very highly sought after on the international art market, and so artifacts continue to be dug up without documentation of the contexts in which they were buried. A lack of extensive archaeological study has also severely limited our understanding of the Nok cultures.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Arts of Africa, Oceania, and the Americas. 2000. Nok Terracotta (500 B.C.–200 A.D.). The Met’s Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anon. 2015. Research continues into 3000 year-old Nok culture of sub-Saharan Africa. Adventures in Archaeology. Archaeology News from Past Horizons, February 8.&lt;/ref&gt; A joint research project with Goethe University and the National Commission for Museums and Monuments conducted since 2005 showed that more than 90% of Nok Culture sites known in the research area have been illegally looted. Art historical studies carried out shows that over 1,000 Nok terracotta sculptures have been illegally excavated and smuggled into Europe, the USA, Japan, and elsewhere. In February 2013, [[Daily Trust]] reported that the Nigerian [[Ministry of Tourism, Culture, and National Orientation]] repossessed five Nok statuettes looted by a French thief in August 2010. The pieces had been seized by French customs agents and were repatriated following a Nigerian Government Directive.&lt;ref&gt;Mustapha Suleiman (February 3, 2013), [http://allafrica.com/stories/201302030190.html France Hands Over Stolen Nigerian Artifacts] ''[[Daily Trust]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; What further complicates the problem are the many workshops which fake Nok sculptures and then put them on the market as authentic.&lt;ref name="AMV" /&gt;

An '''office toy''' (also '''executive toy''' or '''desk toy''') is a [[novelty item]] typically placed on the desk of a [[corporate executive]] or other [[office worker]]. They have no work-related function, but are often intended to provide decoration or pleasure, [[relieve stress]] or inspire [[creativity]].&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;Hsiang Cheng 'Sam' Wang (2007) The Investigation of Office Toy. National Central Library&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; The [[Newton's cradle]] is a classic example of an office toy.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cosmos/&gt;

==Functions==
Different types of office toys provide different needs to their users. Although providing pleasure and being decorative could be the two major functions in office toys, there are still some differences between each types of office toys. For example, [[puzzle]]-type toys can also help inspire creativity. A [[fidget spinner]] is an office toy that is used to reduce stress or boredom.&lt;ref name=Fidget&gt;James Plafke (2016) [https://www.forbes.com/sites/jplafke/2016/12/23/fidget-spinners-are-the-must-have-office-toy-for-2017/#48a6919618a4 Fidget Spinners Are The Must-Have Office Toy For 2017] ''[[Forbes]], 23 December 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Design curator Donald Albrecht described executive toys as "aspirational" objects, "less tools for provoking creativity than foghorns of identity and status in a sea of corporate homogeneity."&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

[[File:Olifant, Aachener Domschatz.jpg|thumb|Olifant from the [[Aachen Cathedral]]'s [[Schatzkammer]]]]

'''Olifant''' (an alternate spelling of the word [[elephant]]) was the name applied in the [[Middle Ages]] to [[ivory]] [[Horn (instrument)|hunting horns]] made from elephants' [[tusk]]s. One of the most famous olifants belonged to the legendary Frankish knight [[Roland]], [[protagonist]] of ''[[The Song of Roland]]''.

In ''The Song of Roland'', Roland carries his olifant while serving on the rearguard of [[Charlemagne]]'s army. When they are attacked at the [[Battle of Roncevaux]], [[Oliver (paladin)|Oliver]] tells Roland to use it to call for aid, but he refuses. Roland finally relents, but the battle is already lost. He tries to destroy the olifant along with his sword [[Durendal]], lest they fall into enemy hands. In the end, Roland blows the horn, but the force required bursts his temple, resulting in death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Song of Roland'' ([[Oxford]] text, ''trans.'' Douglas David Roy Owen, 1972. George Allen and Unwin, {{ISBN|0-04-841003-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Karlamagnussaga]]'' elaborates (V. c.XIV) that Roland's olifant was a [[unicorn]]'s horn, hunted in [[India]].

Another famous olifant belonged to [[Gaston IV of Bearn|Gaston IV]], viscount of [[Béarn]], and is now preserved in the Spanish city of [[Saragosse]], which he helped conquer from the [[Banu Hud]].

==Salernitan oliphants==
The ''Horn'' or ''Oliphant of Ulph'', preserved in the treasury of [[York Minster]] is one of a group that were carved in [[Salerno]]&lt;ref&gt;Hanns Swarzenski, "Two Oliphants in the Museum", ''Bulletin of the Museum of Fine Arts'' '''60''' (1962):27-45) esp. pp 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt; in the first half of the eleventh century. In one of its bands of low-relief carving, addorsed paired [[griffon]]s have tails that terminate in monstrous eared heads.

The horn of Ulph is most likely the very Horn of Tenure given to York Minster by the Viking nobleman Ulph, who resided in Yorkshire before the reign of [[Edward the Confessor]]; thus the Horn of Ulph cannot be dated later than the first half of the eleventh century&lt;ref&gt;Swarzenski 1962:36.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A group of surviving ivory horns carved with bands of low relief have been attributed to the same Salerno workshops as the Oliphant of Ulph:&lt;ref&gt;Swarzenski (1962:34ff, 40).&lt;/ref&gt; the oliphant of the Chartreuse de Portes,&lt;ref&gt;Conserved in the [[Cabinet des Médailles]], [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|Bibliothèque nationale]], Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; an oliphant in the [[Boston Museum of Fine Arts]], the horn of [[Muri Abbey]] conserved in Vienna,&lt;ref&gt;Swartzenski (1962:34) supports T.D.Kendrick's assertion (Kendrick, "The Horn of Ulph", ''Antiquity'' '''11''' (1937:237ff) that the oliphant from Muri was carved in the same workshop as the Horn of Ulph.&lt;/ref&gt; and oliphants from the treasury of the [[Basilica of St. Sernin, Toulouse]], and [[La Seo Cathedral|Saragossa Cathedral]].&lt;ref&gt;Swartzenski 1962:40 and illus.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oppenheim Toy Portfolio''' was founded in 1989 as the only independent consumer review of children's media by [[child development]] experts Joanne Oppenheim and her daughter Stephanie Oppenheim.

In 1989 Joanne was already an expert on children's play and [[toy]]s with her books, Kids &amp; Play and Buy Me! Buy Me!. In addition to her 40 plus children's books, Joanne's by-line appeared in Working Mother Magazine, [[Parents (magazine)|Parents]], [[Parenting (magazine)|Parenting]], [[Child (magazine)|Child]], [[Family Circle]] and [[Ladies' Home Journal]]. She wrote other parenting books while on the publication staff at The [[Bank Street College of Education]], where she received her Masters in Children's Literature. Her books have won the Mott Literacy Award, the National Council for Social Studies Carter G. Woodson Book Award and she is the recipient of the Curious George Award for Literacy. (For a fuller bio visit joanneoppenheim.com.)

In 1989 Stephanie was practicing [[corporate law]] in [[New York City|NYC]]. Since she was five she wanted to be a [[lawyer]]—like her dad, grandfather, great uncle and brother. It was amusing that her mother played with toys for a living. Her friends starting calling for toy advice from Joanne...which mobile? which ride on? Quite honestly, Stephanie couldn't quite understand what the big deal was...you go to the store and buy a toy. When Stephanie had her first son, everything changed. She quickly discovered that there was no independent consumer information about children's media. After many lengthy conversations, Stephanie convinced Joanne to start the Oppenheim Toy Portfolio.

The original [[newsletter]] was a big hit and the mother/daughter team wrote their first book together for [[HarperCollins]] in 1994, The Best Toys, Books, Videos and Music for Kids. In 1998, they formed their own [[publishing company]] and published the first annual Oppenheim Toy Portfolio. They also published their Read It! Play It! Literacy Series. During this time, Joanne published several more books for and about children and welcomed seven grandchildren into the family. Stephanie had another child and received a Masters in [[Psychology]] from [[New York University|NYU]] with a specialization in [[parenting|parenthood]].

Their Oppenheim Toy Portfolio awards have become a [[wikt:benchmark|benchmark]] of excellence with consumers, toy makers and the media. They have appeared on OPRAH, [[CNN]], [[NBC Nightly News]], ABC World News Tonight, [[MSNBC]], Lifetime, and both are Contributors to NBC's TODAY Show.

An '''orphan film''' is a [[motion picture]] work that has been abandoned by its owner or [[copyright]] holder; also, any film that has suffered neglect.

==History==
The exact origin of the term orphan film is unclear.  By the 1990s, however, film archivists were commonly using this colloquialism to refer to motion pictures abandoned by their owners.  Before the end of the decade, the phrase emerged as the governing metaphor for film preservation, first in the United States, then internationally.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Lukow, "The Politics of Orphanage:  The Rise and Impact of the 'Orphan Film' Metaphor on Contemporary Preservation Practice", paper delivered at the University of South Carolina symposium, "Orphans of the Storm:  Saving Orphan Films in the Digital Age", September 23, 1999.  http://www.sc.edu/filmsymposium/archive/orphans2001/lukow.html .  As early as October 1950 ''Industrial Marketing'' magazine referred to 16mm industrial sales movies as orphan films.  Restoration expert Robert Gitt was quoted using the metaphor as early as 1992, to refer to silent-era films, newsreels, and kinescopes.  Robert Epstein, “Mining Hollywood's Old Movie Gold,”  ''Los Angeles Times'', July 16, 1992, p. F1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
Historians and archivists define the term in both a narrow and a broad sense.  A report from the [[Librarian of Congress]], ''Film Preservation 1993,'' offered a first definition.  As a category of so-called [[orphan works]], orphan films are those “that lack either clear copyright holders or commercial potential” to pay for their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;''Film Preservation 1993: A Study of the Current State of American Film Preservation: Report of the Librarian Of Congress'',  by Annette Melville and Scott Simmon, Washington, DC: NFPB/LOC, 1993.  https://www.loc.gov/film/study.html&lt;/ref&gt;   However, a much wider group of works fall under the orphan rubric when the term is expanded to refer to all manner of films that have been neglected.  The neglect might be physical (a deteriorated film print), commercial (an unreleased movie), cultural (censored footage), historical (a forgotten World War I-era production) or technical (footage from television commercials and series or music videos).

This broader conception is typically illustrated by a list of orphaned genres.  In ''Redefining Film Preservation: A National Plan'' (1994),&lt;ref&gt;''Redefining Film Preservation: A National Plan; Recommendations of the Librarian Of Congress in Consultation with the National Film Preservation Board'', coordinated by Annette Melville and Scott Simmon, Washington, DC: NFPB/LOC, 1994.  https://www.loc.gov/film/plan.html&lt;/ref&gt;  the Librarian of Congress enumerated newsreels, actuality footage, silent films, experimental works, home movies, independent fiction and documentary films, political commercials, amateur footage, along with advertising, educational and industrial films as culturally significant orphans.  To this the National Film Preservation Foundation adds animation, ethnic films, anthropological footage, and fragments.  (See [http://www.filmpreservation.org "What Are Orphan Films"].)

Within a decade the epithet was adopted by scholars and educators.  In ''The Film Experience:  An Introduction'' (2004), for example, Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White include a section on orphan films, defining them simply as "Any sort of films that have survived but have no commercial interests to pay the costs of their preservation."&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Corrigan and Patricia White, ''The Film Experience:  An Introduction'' (Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2004), 391–98. They add to the list of orphaned genres government-produced films, citing ''What You Should Know about Biological Warfare'' (1952)  This film is viewable as a digital file at https://archive.org/details/WhatYouS1952  as part of the Prelinger Collection of “ephemeral films.”  Collector-activist [[Rick Prelinger]] is one of the people most responsible for raising awareness of orphan films.&lt;/ref&gt;

Defined in this way, more films are orphans than not.  Many are more accurately described as “footage,” recordings shot on celluloid but not intended to be completed works or theatrical releases.  The millions of feet of [[home movies]] and newsreel [[outtakes]] alone outnumber the quantity of film stock used to make all of the [[feature films]] ever released by Hollywood studios.

==Movement==
The resurgent interest in these films is due to their rich value as cultural and historical artifacts.  Documentarians, filmmakers, historians, curators, collectors and scholars have joined forces with archivists because they deem orphans not only historical documents, but also evidence of alternative, suppressed, minority or forgotten histories.

Since 1999, hundreds of these devotees have gathered for the biennial [http://www.nyu.edu/orphanfilm] Orphan Film Symposium]. 
In their introduction to the anthology ''Mining the Home Movie'' (2008) Karen Ishizuka and Patricia Zimmermann assess the impact of these symposiums.

{{Quote|In 1999, film historian Dan Streible and several other interdisciplinary faculty members at the University of South Carolina initiated a symposium on orphan films that drew together archivists, film historians, artists, curators, and other to discuss and screen works within a rigorous scholarly context. Orphan Film Symposium I was entitled “Orphans of the Storm: Saving Orphan Films in the Digital Age” and was held in September 1999. Orphan Film Symposium II, “Documenting the 20th Century,” was held in March 2001; Orphan Film Symposium III, “Sound/Music/Voice: Listening to Orphan Films,” in September 2002; and Orphan Film Symposium IV, “On Location: Place and Region in Forgotten Films,” in March 2004. These four symposia have functioned to generate new research and curatorial activities and have lent increased visibility to the orphan film cause. They have also provided a significant academic and curatorial context for amateur film research.

The Orphan Film symposia, together with an important presence for orphan, amateur, and small-gauge films within the Association of Moving Image Archivists throughout the 1990s and afterward, suggest the coalescing of various international and regional movements to look more closely at these subaltern cinemas.|&lt;ref&gt;Karen L. Ishizuka and Patricia R. Zimmermann, eds. ''Mining the Home Movie: Excavations in Histories and Memories'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2008), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After the fifth Orphan Film Symposium ("Science, Industry &amp; Education") took place at the University of South Carolina (March 2006), [[New York University]] took up the project, incorporating it into the Department of Cinema Studies and its Moving Image Archiving and Preservation master's program at the [[Tisch School of the Arts]]. Orphans 6, 7, and 8 took place in New York City. The 2008 symposium focused on neglected films and videos by, about, against, and under "the state." The 2010 edition, "Moving Pictures Around the World," included speakers from 17 nations. In 2012, [[Museum of the Moving Image (New York City)|Museum of the Moving Image]] in Queens co-hosted the eighth symposium, "Made to Persuade". The ninth and tenth symposiums took place at major institutions outside of New York. [[EYE Film Institute Netherlands]] hosted Orphans 9 ("The Future of Obsolescence," 2014) in Amsterdam, attracting attendees from 30 nations. Orphans 10 ("Sound," 2016) convened at the Library of Congress [[Packard Campus for Audio-Visual Conservation]] in Culpeper, Virginia.
 
In 2001, members of these academic-archival professions began referring to an “orphan film movement.”  As archivist-scholar Caroline Frick has written, some of the most active participants identify themselves as “orphanistas,” passionate advocates for saving, studying, and screening neglected cinema.  In 2004, visual anthropologist Emily Cohen wrote that the movement's creative and intellectual ferment constituted an “Orphanista Manifesto.”&lt;ref&gt;Caroline Frick, ''Restoration Nation:  Motion Picture Archives and 'American' Film Heritage'', PhD diss. University of Texas at Austin, 2005, [http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/frickd15921/frickd15921.pdf UT Austin library PDF] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604204547/http://www.lib.utexas.edu/etd/d/2005/frickd15921/frickd15921.pdf |date=2011-06-04 }}, and in Frick's ''Saving Cinema: The Politics of Preservation,'' (Oxford University Press, forthcoming); Emily Cohen, “The Orphanista Manifesto: Orphan Films and the Politics of Reproduction,” ''American Anthropologist'' (December 2004), 719–31.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rick Prelinger Howard Besser.orphanfilms.theora.ogv|thumb|right|440px|[[Rick Prelinger]] ([[Prelinger Archives]]) and [[Howard Besser]] (NYU professor of cinema studies) answer the questions "What is an orphan film?" and "What is the Orphan Film Symposium?" (Recorded at the [[University of South Carolina]], March 2006) running time 2:55]]

More pragmatically, in the United States the group's rising influence affected discourse and policies about copyright reform, joining the broader media reform movement. Examples of this include the 2003 Supreme Court case ''[[Eldred v. Ashcroft]]'' and the 2006 Copyright Office [http://www.copyright.gov/orphan/ ''Report on Orphan Works'']. In September 2008, the [[U.S. Senate]] passed a bill (S.2913) "to provide a limitation on judicial remedies in copyright infringement cases involving orphan works," but the House of Representatives adjourned before addressing the measure.

Although U.S. copyright stakeholders confine their discussion to the narrower definition of an orphan (a work with no identifiable rightsholder or whose rights holder cannot be located), the broader conception—an orphan film as a neglected object—continues to be used internationally. Film archivists working quite separately in different nations have used the orphan metaphor for a decade. At the Cinemateca de Cuba, for example, the term "huérfanos" has been used to conceptualize the lost and abandoned works of Cuban film history, its "orfandad."  The Nederlands Filmmuseum preserves and programs its "Bits &amp; Pieces" series of unidentified film fragments, its "foundlings." The China Film Archive in Beijing uses a translatable orphan film metaphor as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Streible, "The Role of Orphan Films in the 21st Century Archive," ''[[Cinema Journal]]'' 46.3 (Spring 2007): 124–28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another indication of the international interest in orphan films was filmmaker Martin Scorsese's announcement of a World Cinema Foundation (WCF) at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. Press reports stated that the WCF would preserve "orphan" films. By 2008, however, the WCF's mission statement referred only to "neglected" films rather than orphans, as the foundation helps fund preservation of lesser known theatrical motion pictures, which remain under the legal ownership of some party. [http://www.worldcinemafoundation.org World Cinema Foundation] In 2013 the foundation proper was renamed the World Cinema Project, which is overseen by The Film Foundation Scorsese created in 1990.

In April 2008, the [[International Federation of Film Archives]] (FIAF) endorsed a [http://www.fiafnet.org/uk/members/Fair%20Use.cfm "Declaration on Fair Use and Access"] which stated "FIAF supports efforts to clarify the legal status of 'orphan' motion pictures and related promotional and historical materials for the purpose of preservation and public access."  Shortly thereafter, on June 4, 2008, the European Union announced the signing of a new "Memorandum of Understanding" on orphan works. The EU's Digital Libraries Initiative produced the statement.  Signatories included key institutions in moving image archiving and representatives of rightsholders: Association Des Cinematheques Europeennes - [[Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques]], the [[British Library]], European Film Companies Alliance, [[Federation Europeenne Des Realisateurs De L'audiovisuel]], Federation Internationale Des Associations De Producteurs De Films, and the International Federation Of Film Distributors. See [http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/newsroom/cf/itemdetail.cfm?item_id=4145 EU Press Release on Orphan Works.]. In 2010, the Association of European Film Archives and Cinematheques carried out a survey among its members to assess the dimension of orphan films. According to this survey, more than 210,000 films preserved in Europe's Film Archives are considered orphan.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ace-film.eu/?page_id=246&lt;/ref&gt;
In October 2012, the EU adopted the Orphan Works [[Directive 2012/28/EU]] which legally allows the (online) use of orphan works across Europe, provided that a search for the rights holder has been carried before. 
Currently, the [[European Union]] is addressing copyright, access, and preservation issues via FORWARD, a three-year project (2013-2016) to create a registry of orphan films. Officially termed  "Framework for a EU-wide Audiovisual Orphan Works Registry," the project aims to create simplified process for determining the rights status of moving image works.

== What ''type'' of thing is literature? ==
Literature can be described as all of the following:

* [[Communication]] &amp;ndash; activity of conveying information. Communication requires a sender, a message, and an intended recipient, although the receiver need not be present or aware of the sender's intent to communicate at the time of communication; thus communication can occur across vast distances in time and space.
** [[Written communication]] (writing) &amp;ndash; representation of language in a textual medium through the use of a set of signs or symbols (known as a writing system).&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Daniels, "The Study of Writing Systems", in ''The World's Writing Systems'', ed. Bright and Daniels, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;
* Subdivision of [[culture]] &amp;ndash; shared attitudes, values, goals, and practices that characterizes an institution, organization, or group.
** One of [[the arts]] &amp;ndash; imaginative, creative, or nonscientific branch of knowledge, especially as studied academically.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/the-arts the arts].

'''''Portrait of Francisco de Pisa''''' is a 1614 painting by [[El Greco]], now in the [[Kimbell Art Museum]] in Fort Worth, Texas. Most art historians identify it as doctor [[Francisco de Pisa]], a Spanish cleric, though a minority identify it as the Italian historian [[Giacomo Bosio]] due to the words shown in the open book. Francisco de Pisa was an enemy of [[Teresa of Ávila]], who he criticised because he felt that her works contained "much that contradicts truth and sound doctrine and all good use of mental prayer". The pose of the subject is similar to that in ''[[Portrait of Cardinal Tavera]]'', which is of a similar date.

'''''Portrait of a man with a beer jug''''' is a painting by the [[Dutch Golden Age painter]] [[Frans Hals]], painted in the early 1630s, now in a private collection.

==Painting ==
This painting was documented by [[Seymour Slive]] in 1974, who claimed that it was in the collection of [[Henry Reichhold]] in White Plains, New York.&lt;ref&gt;Frans Hals, by Seymour Slive, 1974 a catalog raisonné of Hals works by Seymour Slive: Volume Three, the catalogue, National gallery of Art: Kress Foundation, Studies in the History of European Art, London - Phaidon Press, 1974, catalog #74, pp. 44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The figure of a red deer on the front of the beer jug corresponds with the house name "Het Rode Hert" of the Haarlem beer brewer [[Cornelis Guldewagen]], whose portrait was painted by Hals in 1660. Though the genre of the work is similar to works painted by Hals in the early thirties, the rough brush strokes are more similar to his work in the sixties. Possibly, the man with the jug and Guldewagen himself are the same:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In an old genre painting of [[Haarlem]] from the 1650s, a man is transporting beer jugs with a horse-drawn sled. The jugs have a red deer on them, the symbol of Guldewagen's brewery:&lt;ref&gt;Research on catalog nr. 67 "Cornelis Guldewagen", by C.A. van Hees for ''Frans Hals'', Exhibition catalog, 1962 for the Frans Hals Museum, title : Exhibition on the Occasion of the Centenary of the Municipal Museum at Haarlem, 1862-1962, exhibition committee: H.P.

'''Pulchri Studio''' ([[Latin language|Latin]]:"For the study of beauty") is a Dutch art society, art institution and art studio based in [[The Hague]] ('s-Gravenhage), [[Netherlands]].&lt;ref name=Sillevis&gt;{{cite book|last=Sillevis|first=John|title=Dutch Drawings from the Age of Van Gogh: From the Collection of the Haags Gemeentemuseum|year=1993|publisher=Premier Book Marketing Ltd.|isbn=0-915577-24-0|pages=11|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=b4A-T6fEJsG5hAfPvsHCBQ&amp;sqi=2&amp;hl=cs&amp;id=Zh9QAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Pulchri+Studio+1847&amp;q=Latin#search_anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This institute began in 1847 at the home of painter [[Netherlandse kunstschilders|Lambertus Hardenberg]]. Since 1893 the club has its residence in the villa at ''Lange Voorhout 15'' in The Hague, which is currently a brownish aubergine color. There are accepted as members artistically working members (painters, sculptors and photographers) and art lovers. The members will be selected from a given by the general committee.

An artist membership allows the artist to exhibit his own works in the galleries of the Company. These so-called sales exhibitions have passed since the founding of the association until today integral part of this institution! Art lovers have to be invited by other members. The association leases its properties even to nonmembers, too.

==Origins==
[[File:Paul Gabriël - Molen bij een plas.jpg|thumb|Paul Gabriël: Windmill in a pond.]]
The unspoilt countryside around even the rich coastal town of [[The Hague]]&lt;ref&gt;At that time was The Hague was considered the most beautiful village in Europe.&lt;/ref&gt; with its rural environment and the unspoiled landscape and nature and the nearby fishing village of [[Scheveningen]] attracted many young artists.&lt;ref&gt;The small spots like Loosduinen, Voorburg and Wassenaar were quite popular because of their virginity.&lt;/ref&gt; The artists wanted to be far away from the state-run requirements of art ([[neo-classicism]]) and liked to decide their own way. The model was the successful artist colony of [[Barbizon]] south of Paris in the forest of [[Fontainebleau]]. The unaltered life of the people and the unspoilt polders and the [[North Sea]] coast played an important role. They wanted to be far away from the beginning in the Netherlands industrialisation in [[Amsterdam]] and [[Rotterdam]].

==History==
[[File:Diligentia - 's-Gravenhage - 20091090 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Diligentia.]]
[[File:Interieur, overzicht van de antichambrezaal met kunstexpositie - 's-Gravenhage - 20407039 - RCE.jpg|thumb|Exhibition with a view to the entrance.]]
Following the abolition of the [[patronage]] for artist they were searching for a new way. The city of 's-Gravenhage (The Hague) with its surroundings and the coastal landscape of the [[North Sea]] at [[Scheveningen]] became attractive for young painters. In 1847 with the establishment of the association Pulchri Studio such a new approach has been emerged. These artist's association is a typical Dutch development.&lt;ref&gt;In the Netherlands the concept of ''societät'' or ''cooperative'' was practised. They are known as the guild of Sin Lucas, which was for the Painters. At the end of the eighteenth century they discontonued.&lt;/ref&gt; It stands in the continuation of the tradition of the old academies of the 17th and 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;The old academy has nothing in common with the new one.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Since the rule of Napoleon these academies were completely under state control and the local teaching conception. And these new cooperatives meant the outbreak of these artists, linked to the freedom of genre and color palette. They wanted to determine the expressiveness of the colors by themselves.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pulchri Studio developed for the resident artists' colonies of The Hague, Laren and the estate Oosterbeek the center and was also the linking of creativity, the contact with each other and the world outside, too.&lt;/ref&gt; A special role has played gatherings, which were called ''art considerations'' (Kunstbeschouwingen). They offered the artists the opportunity to present their own works the other members and to exchange information with the other painters. This way of handling the works creators as an ''Apprentice'' with other artists as ''Master'' has been the guarantee of the success of the Hague School.&lt;ref&gt;The Hague School ultimately became synonymous with the famous [[Dutch Impressionism]]. The [[Amsterdam School|Amsterdam Impressionism]], as [[Allebé|School of Allebé]] references, was ultimately the continuation of this trend.&lt;/ref&gt; The location served as a studio and workshop. Right at the beginning this cooperative had no exhibition rooms. Alternatively the painters participated in the two or three-yearly ''Exhibition of Living Masters''.&lt;ref&gt;This exhibition had been a touring exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This exhibition at the Kingdom of the united Netherlands was very important. She was the only way for the still unknown painters to be become known at all in the home.&lt;/ref&gt; – In 1882, [[Vincent van Gogh]] participated in such an art appreciation along with Bosboom and Henkes. The location had the function of the social contact to the native population. It wasn't only a place of social encounter, but at the same time it offered to the artists the opportunity to communicate with collectors and dealers. – This was very important.

Among the founding members of ''Pulchri'' has been [[Netherlandse kunstschilder|Lambertus Hardenberg]], [[Willem Roelofs]], [[Jan Hendrik Weissenbruch]] and [[Bartholomeus Johannes van Hove]]. In 1847, Van Hove has been the first chairman of the artists association. Short time later King [[William II of the Netherlands|Willem II.]] took over the [[patron]]age.&lt;ref&gt;This attached particular importance to the location seat of the government and the king.&lt;/ref&gt; A short time later [[Johannes Bosboom]], [[Jozef Israels]], [[Hendrik Willem Mesdag]], [[Jan Weissenbruch]] and some lesser-known artists joined Pulchri. Subsequent significant members are also [[Jan Sluyters]], [[Paul Citroen]] and [[Jan Willem Sluiter|Willy Sluiter]].

Many painters, who are today attributed to the [[Hague School]], had position on the board and made this cooperative to a stronghold: Bosboom was chairman from 1852 to 1853, Israëls from 1875–1878 and Mesdag from 1898–1907. But even [[Jacob Maris]] and [[Willem Maris]], [[Anton Mauve]], [[Roelofs]] and [[Jan Weissenbruch]] were members of the executive committee. They were responsible for the ''drawing room'', the ''art considerations'' or the ''social meetings''.

The growing membership forced the organizers to expand and in 1901 it was moved to the building on the Lange Voorhout 15.

In 2004, a number of works from Pulchri were stolen, later recovered in 2007.&lt;ref name="Cirque de Pepin"&gt;{{cite web|last=Cirque de Pepin|title=H.M.S. is back|url=http://www.cirque.nl/info/news_archive.html|work=OKT 2007|publisher=Cirque.nl|accessdate=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The two rival cooperatives==
[[File:A town on the river Vecht by Theophile de Bock (1851-1904).jpg|thumb|Théophile de Bock (1895/1905): A town on the river Vecht – private collection.]]
During its turbulent history were attempts at secession or counter companies. None of them should never attain the importance of Pulchri Studion. But this is an indication that politics of these cooperative is not always met with broad approval. One of these countermovements is the [[Haagse Kunstkring]]. In 1891 this cooperative was created by the painter [[Théophile de Bock]] and the architect [[Paul du Rieu]].&lt;ref&gt;Haagse Kunstkring means loosely translated: ''[[The Hague Art Circle]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; It has remained until now and has been awarded to its centenary with the medal of the city of The Hague.

In The Hague in the year 1884 a smaller Artists Association – [[Arti et Industriae]] was established. Their aim is to promote Dutch art craft and has a pension fund, too. From the beginning it is more oriented towards the subject to industry and industrial progress. So it has a completely different orientation than the Hague School with her Pulchri Studio, which wanted to immortalize the untouched nature and the genuine life in the country, the podern and on the coast. – Thus it should never attain the significance and charisma as Pulchri Studio. Arti et Industriae had set oneself the goal of contact and coordination. They organizes exhibitions, too. However, their existence was secured by the proximity to the seat of government.

==Pulchri Studio and the Art Academy==
From the Hague School and the [[Royal Academy of Art, The Hague]] went a favorable effect on the development of the artists association ''Pulchri Studio''. This society took over the function for the promotion of the fine arts. In this environment were excellent teachers and students.&lt;ref&gt;In 1682, this Academy was initially founded as a school of art and it is the oldest [[art school]] of the Netherlands, too. Through a private initiative, it has been established.&lt;/ref&gt; The place of The Hague and its surroundings was and is important because of the seat of the government. At the Art Academy Blosboom, Willem Maris, Johan Hendrik Weissenbruch and Georg Breitner were also trained.

==Pulchri Studio and the Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij==
The cooperative of Pulchri Studio was open to new technics in painting in the fine art. This resulted in the panel painting to another movement within the Dutch Impressionism, the Hague School.

In [[Bruxelles|Brussels]] in the year 1855 the Society for [[watercolour]]-painting, the "Société Belge des watercolorist" was founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rkd.nl/en/ RKD Netherlands Institute for Art History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704121422/https://rkd.nl/en/ |date=4 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arba-esa.be/ Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles]&lt;/ref&gt; She was quite successful. This movement was an expression of social and country-specific implementation of the very successful work of [[The Royal Watercolour Society]] to London. Precisely because of the contacts with the environment of the "Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts de Bruxelles", the watercolours were attractive again as a version of the painting for artists. Indeed, this watercolour technique had reached their third heyday from the end of the 19th century to the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;An important influence came from [[August Macke]] and [[Paul Klee]]. During their tunisian travel in 1914 they had chosen this painting technique in [[watercolour]]s. The artists wanted to show the very bright luminous intensity over there.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kandisky from the expressionist community [[Blauer Reiter|Blue Rider]] from [[München|Munich]] also took care of the watercolour painting. As part of the art movement of [[avant-garde]] he led the watercolour painting to a new meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 1878 the ''[[Hollandsche Teekenmaatschappij]]'' (in English: Dutch Drawing Society) was founded. Its founding members belonged to the core of the ''Hague School'' – the movement of the ''Dutch Impressionism'' and thus the Pulchri Studio.
The society was so organized that it was independent, but closely linked to Pulchri Studio remained. Its honorary members included painters from Belgium, Germany and Italy.

In 1901, this society ceased to exist.

==Policy and Pulchri Studio==
The Society Pulchri wasn't as conservative as [[Arti et Amicitiae]] to [[Amsterdam]]. Yes, they even rejected the traditional painting styles.

In the royal capital of 's-Gravenhage (The Hague) his caused an uproar and a political issue, too. By the king [[William III of the Netherlands|Willem III]] Hermanus Koekkoek had received a medal in recognition of a work. From Pulchri came the objection that this painting would no longer correspond to the current state of the art.&lt;ref&gt;In this context, the chapter ''A world of light'', P. 7 – 32, ''Impressionism, an international art movement from 1860 to 1920'' referred by Norma Broude is very informative. Here it can be seen how much the conflict was between the '''shaking off''' the [[neoclassicism]] and [[romanticism]] and the '''retention''' of the tradition of craft and the old ways. – The [[landscape painting]] of [[Dutch Golden Age|"The 1. Golden Age of the Netherlands"]] is precisely that tradition, which was rejected by them.&lt;/ref&gt; – In public, the Hague School took the opposite position and stood against the official art policy of the Dutch king. This was notably represented by Artzt, de Bock, Bosboom, Israëls, Jacob and Willem Maris, Mauve, Mesdag and Neuhuys.

In addition they made known that neither one may send them a tender for an art competition nor they will take part in a competition any more.&lt;ref&gt;One relied on the strength of Puchri Studion and her reputation in the country and abroad.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Bley, Britta: Vom Staat zur Nation (in German) – From the state to the nation, page 124-125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the circles that represented the new, radical painting style of impressionism or were only open, it was believed to have triggered something. In those days the queen tried to calm things down by their commitment to Pulchi. There was a no significant change in the policy of the king. – The disappointment was very big and they had to choose their own way.&lt;ref&gt;The existence of Pulchri today and the very well known [[Museum Mesdag]] was the best proof.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Revival after the war ==
After the Second World War was ''Pulchri Studio'' in disrepute: In 1943, the executive committee had submitted the order from Berlin to join the Reich-Chamber of Culture (Reichskulturkammer). In the Kingdom of the Netherlands this act was regarded as an act of collaboration. – After 1945 the chairman at that time, Willy Sluiter, was dismissed. In 1996 Queen [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Beatrix]] just took the patronage of this artists association and helped her back to the traditional reputation and importance in the art scene of The Hague and the Netherlands.

'''''River Landscape with Ferry''''' (1649) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Salomon van Ruysdael]].
It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington D.C..
This painting was owned by [[Jacques Goudstikker]] and was restituted to his heirs in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rkd.nl/explore/images/17034 River Landscape with Ferry] in the [[RKD]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacques Goudstikker was a Jewish art dealer whose works were seized and taken to Germany after his death as part of war booty. The painting was restituted to the Netherlands after the war ([[Rijksdienst voor het Cultureel Erfgoed|RCE]]). It was lent by the RCE to various museums on long-term loans before being given to the [[Rijksmuseum]] in 1960, where it had featured in its Gallery of Honor for years. The painting was selected as one of 120 highlights in the booklet ''[[120 Paintings from the Rijksmuseum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/album120tableaux00rijkuoft#page/n52/mode/1up 2083A4] in the "Album: 120 (Tableaux du) / (Schilderijen uit het) / Paintings from the Rijksmuseum", Opening hours and table of titles of 120 black &amp; white illustrations of paintings in English, Dutch, and French, paperback tourist guide c. 1950-1990, Rijksmuseum Amsterdam&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 it was finally restored to the Goudstikker heirs and since 2007 it has been part of the collection of the National Gallery of Art. It was part of an exhibition ''Reclaimed: paintings from the collection of Jacques Goudstikker'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codart.nl/exhibitions/details/1723/ Article] on [[codart]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This scene is similar to other river landscape paintings Ruisdael made in this period and these often served as inspiration for later painters of landscape.

The '''Symphony No. 5''' was composed by [[Peter Maxwell Davies]] in 1994 on commission from the [[Philharmonia Orchestra]], who gave the world premiere under the composer’s direction at a [[The Proms|BBC Promenade concert]] on 9 August 1994, at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.

==Character and materials==
The form of the symphony (along with those of its predecessors) owes a great debt to the symphonies of [[Jean Sibelius|Sibelius]], in this case particularly the [[Symphony No. 7 (Sibelius)|Seventh]] ({{harvnb|Beecroft|1994|loc=2}}; {{harvnb|Pruslin|1996}}). However, its sense of space, “less architectural than that of the previous symphonies, is a significant new departure, allowing a more relaxed attitude toward musical objects: closer to the Mahlerian aesthetic than at any time since the 1960s” {{harv|Beecroft|1994|loc=5}}. Davies has also cited the often canonic modal counterpoint of Sibelius's [[Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)|Sixth Symphony]] as an influence, and Sibelius's tone poem ''[[En saga]]'' has also been mentioned as a possible source of inspiration {{harv|Warnaby|1995|loc=34}}.

==Instrumentation==
The symphony is scored for 2 flutes (second doubling alto flute), piccolo, 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, double bassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, percussion (marimba, glockenspiel, crotales, [[flexatone]], 2 bass drums [small and large], cymbals, suspended cymbal, tambourine), celesta, harp, and strings.

==Analysis==
On the model of Sibelius’s Seventh, the symphony suggests the traditional four-movement form, but is cast in a single movement. It nevertheless forms an "archipelago of 34 sections of various length" {{harv|Beecroft|1994|loc=2}}. The Symphony is based on material from Davies's 1993 youth-orchestra composition ''Chat Moss'', which in turn is derived from two [[plainchant]]s, the [[Easter]] [[Gradual]] "Haec dies" and the [[Good Friday]] [[Tract (liturgy)|Tract]] "Domine audivi" from [[Book of Habakkuk|Habakkuk]] 3:3 {{harv|Davies|1995}}. It begins with an expansive adagio introduction, followed by music of great energy, characterised by an alternation of stable and unstable episodes {{harv|Warnaby|1995|loc=33}}. The overall tonality of D{{Music|flat}}/C{{Music|Sharp}} with a G secondary pole is established at the outset in a woodwind trio, followed by undisguised modal melodies in the violins and flute. The succeeding faster music reaches a first climax in a Davies hallmark of ascending brass figures with powerful, sustained tritones in the horns that forecast a bigger climax to come, an affirmational brass theme at rehearsal Q2 which "seems to rise as if from the sea, magnifying the fragile flute melody heard at N2 into sudden immensity" {{harv|Beecroft|1994|loc=3}}.

'''The New Zealand Dance Company''' (incorporated as The New Zealand Dance Advancement Trust) is an [[Auckland]] based, nationally focused contemporary dance company.

Established in 2011, by co-founders Chief Executive/Artistic Director (and [[Arts Foundation of New Zealand|Arts Laureate]]) Shona McCullagh and the founding General Manager Frances Turner, the company sought to break the paradigm of dance companies operating on a project by project basis, presenting work by one choreographer, and moved instead to a sustainable model of presenting a variety of choreographic works.

== Productions ==

Language of Living was The New Zealand Dance Company's first production and is composed of five short works by [[New Zealand]] choreographers.

Dreamy McFloat was choreographed by Tupua Tigafua and has music by Richard M Moyle, [[Antonio Vivaldi]], and a poem excerpt from [[John Pule]], Little Sun. Tenerezza was choreographed by Michael Parmenter, with music by [[Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach|C.P.E Bach]]. Human Human God was choreographed by Sarah Foster-Sproull, with music by Eden Mullholland.

Language of Living opened in 2012 at the [[Aotea Centre]] in [[Auckland]]. In 2013 Language of Living toured the [[North Island]] of [[New Zealand]], The New Zealand Dance Company performed in [[Auckland]], [[Warkworth, New Zealand|Warkworth]], [[Whangarei]], [[Orewa]], [[Hawkes Bay]] and [[Wellington]]. In 2014 Language of Living toured in New Zealand, performing in [[Invercargill]], [[Christchurch]], [[Nelson, New Zealand|Nelson]], [[New Plymouth]] and [[Tauranga]].

Rotunda is The New Zealand Dance Company's second production, and its first full-length work.

Rotunda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whyte|first=Raewyn|title=Virtual Rotunda Unites Modern Dance and Brass Band Music|url=http://www.theatreview.org.nz/reviews/review.php?id=6236|publisher=Theatre Review|accessdate=31 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the first major work for the New Zealand Dance Company. It was choreographed by Shona McCullagh.

== Facilities ==
Since 2009, when the Tyler School of Art moved into its new home, a 250,000-square-foot building designed by award-winning architect Carlos Jiménez&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://carlosjimenezstudio.com/tyler-school-of-art/|title=Tyler School of Art (2005-2009)|website=Carlos Jiménez Studio|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Tyler's art students and faculty have had access to expansive, state-of-the-art facilities. Tyler's architecture students and faculty experienced a similar boost in size and quality of facilities when the program moved into a new, 50,000-square-foot Architecture Building in 2012—Temple's first building dedicated solely to architecture.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The two structures, which are connected by a glass-enclosed passageway, are located at Temple University's Main Campus in Philadelphia, giving the Tyler community access to the city's museums, galleries and other arts-related resources. Their location adjacent to Presser Hall (part of Temple University's [[Boyer college of music and dance|Boyer College of Music and Dance]]) and Temple Theaters (part of Temple's School of Theater, Film and Media Arts) has created an arts quadrant in the northeast corner of campus.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The central courtyard between Tyler's two primary buildings is one of the largest green spaces at Temple University's Main Campus. In 2018, the Nicholas Kripal Natural Dye Garden, a collaboration between students and faculty in Tyler's Fibers &amp; Materials Studies and Landscape Architecture programs, was installed in the courtyard, part of a plan to re-activate the courtyard and make it a space for interdisciplinary collaboration and recreation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://twitter.com/TylerSchool/status/1044285110596632577|title=Tyler School of Art on Twitter|work=Twitter|access-date=2018-10-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable Tyler facilities include:

* The Architecture Building, with four floors of studios and exposed air ducts, plumbing pipes and lights in order for students to observe the building's infrastructure.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/facilities|title=Explore Our Facilities {{!}} Tyler School of Art|website=tyler.temple.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 10,000-square foot ceramics facility—one of the largest in the nation—with four gas kilns, 13 electric kilns, a large glaze room and 3-D modeling and printing facilities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Fibers and material studies studios equipped with a computer lab for silk screening and digital printing, a Jacquard Loom, multi-harness floor looms and electronic looms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/programs/fibers-material-studies|title=Fibers &amp;amp; Material Studies|website=Tyler School of Art|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A glass facility with a hot shop with two 530-pound day tanks, four benches and four glory holes; and a cold shop with Merker and Czech lathes and four flameworking stations.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
* Landscape architecture and horticulture facilities at Temple University's large Ambler Campus in suburban Montgomery County, which include a 187-acre Ambler Arboretum and a 5,600 square foot greenhouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ambler.temple.edu/arboretum/gardens|title=Gardens {{!}} Ambler Campus|website=ambler.temple.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 5,600-square-foot metals/jewelry/CAD-CAM facility with 56 bench-top torches, three burn-out ovens, a computer lab, a crucible, a centrifuge, two 3-D printers and more.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Temple Contemporary and public programming ==
Temple Contemporary is Tyler's exhibitions and public programs unit, which has been led by Robert Blackson, Tyler's director of exhibitions and public programming, since 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/who-we-are|title=Who We Are|work=Tyler School of Art|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple Contemporary's galleries and offices are located in the Tyler building at Temple University's Main Campus, although much of its programming takes place in the surrounding Philadelphia community.

Temple Contemporary's mission is "to re-imagine the social function of art through questions of local relevance and international significance.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.templecontemporary.info/|title=Temple Contemporary|website=www.templecontemporary.info|language=en|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; To achieve that goal, Temple Contemporary relies on a "ground-up" programming model. The issues that Temple Contemporary tackles in its gallery exhibitions and other public programming are not determined by its director, but are prompted by a democratic process spearheaded by an advisory council made up of non-Temple-University-based local residents (ranging from high school students to community leaders), Temple University and Tyler faculty faculty members, Temple University and Tyler students and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pewcenterarts.org/post/inside-temple-contemporary-qa-rob-blackson|title=Inside Temple Contemporary: Q&amp;A with Rob Blackson|last=admin|date=2015-08-21|work=The Pew Center for Arts &amp; Heritage|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://tyler.temple.edu/meet-tyler-dean-susan-cahan|title=Meet Tyler dean Susan Cahan|work=Tyler School of Art|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thephiladelphiacitizen.org/rob-blackson-temple-contemporary-2/|title=Temple Contemporary's Rob Blackson Disrupts the Traditional Art Gallery|website=thephiladelphiacitizen.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple Contemporary's community-focused programming that has earned national attention includes "Funeral for a Home" (2014)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://funeralforahome.org/|title=Funeral for a Home|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/05/30/317407504/in-nod-to-history-a-crumbling-philly-row-house-gets-a-funeral|title=In Nod To History, A Crumbling Philly Row House Gets A Funeral|last=|first=|date=|work=NPR's "All Things Considered"|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, an extended commemoration of at-risk urban housing stock and the lives that soon-to-be-demolished homes contain; "reForm" (2014-2015)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://reform-project.org/|title=reForm|website=reForm|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/29/arts/design/art-show-captures-the-wrenching-effects-of-closing-a-school.html|title=Art Show Captures the Wrenching Effects of Closing a School|last=|first=|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a response to the closure of public schools and its impact on urban communities and their children by artist and Tyler faculty member [[Pepón Osorio]]; and "Symphony for a Broken Orchestra" (2017-2018)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://symphonyforabrokenorchestra.org/|title=Symphony for a Broken Orchestra|website=symphonyforabrokenorchestra.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/04/arts/music/philadelphia-david-lang-symphony-for-a-broken-orchestra.html|title=A Symphony Breathes Life Into 400 Broken School Instruments|last=|first=|date=|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;, a citywide effort to collect, display, repair and return broken instruments belonging to Philadelphia's public schools, highlighted by the composition of music for the broken instruments by composer David Lang and the music's performance by a diverse orchestra of local residents.

== History ==
Arts patron Stella Elkins Tyler (of the [[William Lukens Elkins|Elkins]]/[[Widener family]]) donated her estate in Elkins Park, Pennsylvania, to Temple University in the early 1930s. With an interest in progressive education and a deep appreciation of her mentor, the sculptor Boris Blai, Tyler offered her estate with the expressed wish that, through Boris Blai, it would become an environment for the advancement of the fine arts, scholarly study in the arts and individual creativity. As founding dean of what was then known as the Stella Elkins Tyler School of Fine Arts, Blai instilled the school with a commitment to progressive education emphasizing the student's mastery of technique within the framework of a liberal arts curriculum. Blai insisted upon individual attention to each student's needs as the basis of successful teaching. During his 25-year tenure as dean, Blai shaped the school into one of the finest visual arts centers in the country, and his founding ideals still remain paramount to Tyler's educational philosophy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1960, Charles Le Clair succeeded Blai. Under Le Clair, the Tyler campus was improved with construction of a residence hall and two studio/classroom buildings. In 1966, the school's name was changed to the Tyler School of Art, and Le Clair founded the Tyler Study Abroad program in Rome, Italy.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Tyler's programs at [[Temple University Rome]] remain among the most respected fine arts study abroad programs in Europe today. Temple University Rome has expanded to include a full range of liberal arts, architecture, business and law courses with an emphasis on those relating to Rome, Italy and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rome.temple.edu/history/|title=50 YEARS OF TEMPLE ROME – Temple University Rome Campus|website=rome.temple.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Tyler's curriculum continued to grow in response to new definitions of art-making and the role of art in society. New programs and modern facilities in design, ceramics, glass, metals and photography were added.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, Tyler established Art History and Art Education departments on Temple's Main Campus in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The pace of change and growth began to accelerate dramatically in the late 1990s. In 1998, Tyler welcomed Temple's Department of Architecture. In 2009, Tyler moved from Elkins Park into a new, 250,000-square-foot building at Temple's Main Campus.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Three years later, Architecture moved into a new 50,000-square-foot facility connected to the new Tyler building.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Temple's departments of Landscape Architecture &amp; Horticulture and Planning &amp; Community Development became part of Tyler in 2016, for the first time unifying all of the built-environment disciplines at Temple in one academic unit. In 2017, the Tyler School of Art welcomed Susan E. Cahan, who came from Yale University to become first permanent dean of an independent Tyler since the school moved into its new building in 2009.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Tyler's leaders:

* Boris Blai, dean (1935-1960)
* Charles Le Clair, dean (1960-1974)
*Donald M. Lantzy, acting dean (1974-1975)

* David Pease, interim dean (1977-1978) and dean (1978-1984)
*George Bayliiss, dean (1984-1989)
* Rochelle Toner, dean (1989-2002)
* Hester Stinnett, acting dean (2002-2005)
* Keith Anthony Morrison, dean (2005-2008)
