'''''A Teenage Opera''''' is a musical project from the 1960s and was the creation of record producer [[Mark Wirtz]].

== History ==
According to Wirtz, he had been working on an idea for a [[rock opera]] since January 1966, when he was experimenting in his London studio and produced a piece of music entitled "A Touch of Velvet&amp;nbsp;– A Sting of Brass", under the name of "Mood Mosaic". Following a string of successful hits, he was asked to join [[EMI]] as an in-house record producer and he accepted, starting in January 1967.&lt;ref name=kollektionist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kollektionist.net/MarkwirtzTOstory/ |title=The Story Behind "The Teenage Opera" |publisher=The Kollektionist |accessdate=29 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121002031/http://www.kollektionist.net/MarkwirtzTOstory |archivedate=21 November 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://markwirtz0.tripod.com/markpwirtz/id15.html |title=Mark Wirtz&amp;nbsp;– Bio |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He had already seen [[Pink Floyd]] start their career and he personally recommended them to be signed but thought the task of producing them would be better left to fellow producer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]]. Wirtz decided to work with another band he had enjoyed, [[The In Crowd (British band)|The In Crowd]],&lt;ref name=Pally&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fufkin.com/columns/pally/pally_07_01.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030907133011/http://www.fufkin.com/columns/pally/pally_07_01.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 September 2003 |title=Fufkin.com: Robert Pally:  The Mark Wirtz Interview |accessdate=29 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; who soon changed their name to Tomorrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevehowe.com/sh_bio1960.html |title=Biography&amp;nbsp;– Steve Howe Guitar Rondo |accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107223308/http://www.stevehowe.com/sh_bio1960.html |archivedate=7 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wirtz, he dreamed up the idea of Grocer Jack soon after being contracted to EMI and in February 1967 shared the idea with his engineer Geoff Emerick, who agreed to work on it. They decided to call it ''Excerpt from A Teenage Opera'', to imply there was more to come and the recording was produced as part of the Mood Mosaic project.&lt;ref name=kollektionist /&gt; The basic concept of ''A Teenage Opera'' was a series of sketches featuring different characters who lived in a fantasy village. These stories were to be told by a young man to a young girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cherryred.co.uk/rpm/artists/markwirtz.htm |title=RPM Records :  Mark Wirtz |accessdate=2008-01-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080104022218/http://www.cherryred.co.uk/rpm/artists/markwirtz.htm |archivedate=2008-01-04 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wirtz intended the final project to be animated and later compared it to the ''[[Yellow Submarine (1968 film)|Yellow Submarine]]'' by [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref name=Pally /&gt; Wirtz used members of ''Tomorrow'' to produce the first recording.&lt;ref name=LeonardsLair&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonardslair.co.uk/teenage.htm |title=Various Artists&amp;nbsp;– A Teenage Opera&amp;nbsp;– The Original Soundtrack Recording |accessdate=2008-01-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production ==
The first song written was the story of Grocer Jack, the local grocer who was taken for granted until he died.&lt;ref name=LeonardsLair /&gt; Wirtz took an unused backing track from an old recording of his, a song called "Love Will Always Find A Way" and [[Steve Howe (guitarist)|Steve Howe]] was asked to overdub the [[guitar]]. Wirtz had the character of Jack in his imagination but asked [[Keith West]] to write the lyrics for it. After West heard the music, he wrote the lyrics straightaway. Soon after, the single was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]]. The engineer, [[Geoff Emerick]], who was working with [[The Beatles]]' [[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]] album at the time, recorded the song in ''true stereo'', a rarity at the time, with all the latest technology that was available. The song itself featured the "Opera" trademark, the children's chorus, with singers from Corona Stage School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert |last=Webb |title=ROCK &amp; POP: STORY OF THE SONG `EXCERPT FROM A TEENAGE OPERA' Keith |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050107/ai_n9693578 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |date=7 January 2005 |accessdate=2008-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502213332/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20050107/ai_n9693578 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Single releases ===
[[Grocer Jack (Excerpt from A Teenage Opera)]] was released on 28 July 1967 and was an instant hit. It was played continuously throughout the summer, later known as the [[Summer of Love]] and was helped into its number 2 spot by being played on [[Pirate radio|pirate radio station]]s, particularly [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] and [[Radio Caroline]].&lt;ref name=kollektionist /&gt; It was also featured on the very first broadcast of [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] on 30 September 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://philbrodieband.com/muso-radio-one.htm |title=UK POP: BBC Radio 1's First Broadcast, BBC's First and Last TOTPS |accessdate=2008-01-18 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080127144101/http://philbrodieband.com/muso-radio-one.htm| archivedate= 27 January 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only kept off the number 1 spot by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]]'s [[The Last Waltz (song)|The Last Waltz]] and the enormous success of Grocer Jack got the media's attention. Rumours began circulating about the rest of the project; according to one source, the entire project had been completed by September and there was talk of a musical starring [[Cliff Richard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Lister |author2=Russell Newmark |title=Sixties 'Grocer Jack' rock opera gets off its back after 30-year wait |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960521/ai_n14039860 |publisher=[[The Independent]] |location=[[London]] |date=21 May 1996 |accessdate=2008-01-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502213327/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19960521/ai_n14039860 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another single was produced in October, "Sam," with West on vocals and Howe on guitar again. However, it did not get above 38 in the chart. Despite [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] [[disc jockey|DJ]] [[Tony Blackburn]] helping promote it and Wirtz creating a special edited airplay version, the song was a failure, as it simply did not have nearly as much publicity as Grocer Jack did and was played a lot less. The fact many of the pirate stations had been shut down did not help things either. Following this, West made the decision to leave the project. He found it difficult to work between two very different projects and it confused fans.&lt;ref name=kollektionist /&gt; Wirtz meanwhile completed ''(He's Our Dear Old) Weatherman'', which had started out as ''The Paranoiac Woodcutter''. It was the most complex recording so far, containing more than 100 different sounds. However, like "Sam", it received very little airplay, due to Radio 1's seeming inability to play it.{{clarify|date=September 2016}} Wirtz had already begun working on Tomorrow's album and recorded a remake of ''Hallucinations'' for single release. It was renamed to "Mr Rainbow". Wirtz produced this song, sung by Steve Flynn in August 1967. Wirtz took another track from the album, ''Shy Boy'' and it was re-recorded by [[Kippington Lodge]]. These two songs eventually ended up on the final album released in 1996.

''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'' asserted in April 2004 that "Sam" was a major influence on [[Pete Townshend]]'s ''[[Tommy (album)|Tommy]]''.

=== Other recordings ===
Wirtz composed a range of material around this time, releasing it under a series of pseudonyms. Much of the music produced in late 1967 became part of the project and was released on the 1996 album. There were two particular recordings that did not survive, "The Sad Story Of Simon And His Bugle" and "Two's Company, Three Thousand's A Crowd". The latter was a musical comedy, with the voices of [[Tim Rice]] and [[Samantha Jones (singer)|Samantha Jones]]. In January 1968 Wirtz married [[Ross Hannaman]] and subsequently recorded many songs co-written with her. The track "Barefoot and Tiptoe" was one of their collaborations and featured her voice, as well as the Band of the Irish Guards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://mog.com/music/Mark_Wirtz/biography| title= Mark Wirtz Biography| accessdate= 2008-05-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502194856/http://mog.com/music/Mark_Wirtz/biography| archivedate= 2008-05-02| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as by ''The Sweetshop'' but sales were poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://relayer35.com/Yescography/ATeenageOpera.htm |title=A Teenage Opera |accessdate=2008-05-01| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080502202825/http://relayer35.com/Yescography/ATeenageOpera.htm| archivedate= 2 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wirtz was forced to shelve the project and concentrated on ''Tomorrow'', whose album was released in February 1968. However, many songs were released over the years that were intended for the project, for example ''Dream Dream Dream'', performed by Wirtz but credited as Zion De Gallier. An album released in [[Germany]] in 1968 contained what was the basis for the ''Theme from a Teenage Opera''.

Grocer Jack was parodied in the mid 1970s on a [[flexi-disk]] ([[Private Eye recordings]]) released by the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The words were changed to "Grocer Heath, Grocer Heath, cover up those awful teeth", referring to the [[Prime Minister]], [[Edward Heath]].

== Tracks ==
In 1996 a CD was released by Wirtz with every track recorded over the years intended for use in ''A Teenage Opera''. Some of the songs (notably the two singles) were remixed in stereo.

The tracks are as follows:&lt;ref name=LeonardsLair /&gt;

== Career ==
Rorty received her B.A. from the [[University of Chicago]] in 1951, M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from [[Yale University]] in 1954 and 1961 respectively, and an M.A. from [[Princeton University]] in [[anthropology]] (where she has projected getting a second Ph.D.).&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage"&gt;{{cite web|title=Personal Homepage|url=http://amelierorty.blogspot.com/|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CV&gt;{{cite web|title=Curriculum Vitae|url=http://www.bu.edu/philo/files/2011/01/RortyCV.pdf|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began her academic career at [[Wheaton College (Massachusetts)|Wheaton College]] (Mass.) (1957–1961), then began teaching at Rutgers ([[Douglass College]]) in 1962 and taught there through to 1988, by which time she had achieved the rank of distinguished professor.&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage" /&gt; She was also professor in the history of ideas (and director of the program) at [[Brandeis University]] from 1995–2003, and from 2008–2013 was visiting professor at [[Boston University]]. {{as of|2013}} , she will be a visiting professor at [[Tufts University]].&lt;ref name="Leiter Tufts"&gt;{{cite web |last=Leiter |first=Brian |title=Amelie Rorty to be Visiting Professor at Tufts for 2013-15 |url=http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/amelie-rorty-to-be-visiting-professor-at-tufts-for-2013-15.html|work=Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a lecturer in the Department of Global Health and Social Medicine, [[Harvard School of Medicine]].&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BU Page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Faculty Page|url=http://www.bu.edu/philo/people/faculty/visiting-professors/amelie-oksenberg-rorty/|work=Boston University|accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harvard medical news"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rorty publishes on ambivalence, education, and other topics|url=http://ghsm.hms.harvard.edu/news/articles/rorty_publishes_on_ambivalence_education_and_other_topics/|accessdate=28 July 2013|newspaper=Department of Global Health and Public Medicine|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rorty is the recipient of numerous awards and fellowships over the course of her career: Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Studies (1968-1969), King's College, Cambridge (1971-1973), Institute for Advanced Study (1980-1981), John Simon Guggenheim (1990-1991), Woodrow Wilson Center (1994-1995), and the National Humanities Center (2007-2008).&lt;ref name="Blogspot homepage" /&gt;

===Work===
Rorty has primarily worked on problems in moral psychology and moral education. She is especially interested in the many distinctive –-and often conflicting—functions of morality as a social practice, as it sets prohibitions, projects ideals, defines duties, characterizes virtues. Exploring the dark side of some of the virtues—courage as bravado, integrity as moral narcissism, the ambivalence of love--, she has also analyzed the advantages of resistance to the obligations of morality: the benefits of self-deception, the lures of moral weakness, the wisdom of ambivalence, the hidden rationale of allegedly irrational emotions. She approaches many of these issues historically (through Aristotle, Spinoza, Hume and Freud) and anthropologically (projecting a study of exiles, immigrants, refugees. who perforce absorb a new set of ‘moral’ values.) She is presently finishing a book provisionally entitled ''On the Other Hand: The Ethics of Ambivalence''.

Rorty is the author of over 120 scholarly articles and the author or editor of more than a dozen scholarly books of original essays. A monograph, ''Mind in Action: Essays in Philosophy of Mind'', was published by Beacon Press in 1988 (paperback edition 1991). She also edited and contributed to ''Explaining Emotions'' (U. California Press, 1980), ''Essays on Aristotle’s Ethics'' (1980, U.California Press), and co-edited ''Essays on Aristotle’s De Anima'' (Oxford, 1992) with Martha Nussbaum. She initiated and served as general editor of ''Modern Studies in Philosophy'' (Doubleday-Anchor) and of ''Major Thinkers'' (University of California Press). Other notable books she edited include ''The Many Faces of Evil'' (Routledge, 2001), ''The Identities of Persons'' (1976, U. California Press) and ''The Many Faces of Philosophy'' (Oxford, 2000).

==Personal life==
Oksenberg Rorty, daughter of Polish Jews Klara and Israel Oksenberg, was born in Belgium  and emigrated with her parents to Virginia, where she was raised on a farm.&lt;ref name="My Life"&gt;{{cite web|title=My Life |url=http://www.mylife.com/l-amelie-rorty-e730609094322 |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="American Philosophy"&gt;{{cite web |title=American Philosophy excluding Pragmatism |url=http://www.gach.com/gach/L1941-02.HTM |publisher=John Gach Books |accessdate=28 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She enrolled at a young age at the University of Chicago, and went on to pursue a doctorate at Yale, where she married [[Richard Rorty]], a fellow graduate student.&lt;ref name="Critical Theory Archive"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Guide to the Richard Rorty Papers MS.C.017 |journal=UC Irvine, Critical Theory Archive, Online Archive of California |volume=MS.C.017 |url=http://www.oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/kt9p3038mq/dsc/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had a son, Jay, and divorced in 1972.&lt;ref name="Richard Rorty Obit"&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanford |first=John |title=Richard M.

The Nazi party used cartoons and caricatures as a main part of their [[propaganda]] regime and as an effective way to send out their message and spread their opinions across Germany. The use of caricatures was a popular method within the party when pursuing their campaign against America, in particular President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]].

==Nazi cartoons and caricatures==
Cartoons and caricatures were an important part of Nazi propaganda. ''[[Der Stürmer]]'' provided a great platform for the party to publish their cartoons. [[Philipp Rupprecht]] was the newspapers lead cartoonist, drawing over one thousand anti-Semitic cartoons during his career. Although his style is reported to have changed throughout his years of work, his caricatures always depicted Jews as the Nazi stereotype: short, fat, ugly, unshaven, drooling, sexually perverted, bent-nosed and with pig like eyes. This shows how caricatures worked to the advantage of the Nazi party, allowing them to portray what they wanted in a way which photographs couldn't. A photograph would show a Jew as a human, whereas caricatures meant the Nazi party could portray Jews as inhumane in cartoon form. The cartoons intended to spread the create widespread support for Nazi ideology, in this case, anti-Americanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://prezi.com/whqr5_rwn32o/nazi-cartoons/|title=Nazi Cartoons|website=prezi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of Propaganda between Germany and the USA==
There were several events subsequent to Hitler coming into power which created the relationship which led to the hostile propaganda between Germany and America.

===The Nazi Boycott of Jewish businesses in April 1933. ===
When word of the [[Nazi boycott of Jewish businesses]] reached America, the [[American Jewish Committee]] and [[American Jewish Congress]] called an emergency meeting. Here it was decided America would protest the boycott. On March 27, protest rallies occurred in New York; Chicago; Boston; Philadelphia; Baltimore; Cleveland and 70 other locations. The Nazi party denounced this as ‘slander' generated by Jews of German origin and announced a campaign of sharp countermeasures against the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/The_Anti-Nazi_Boycott.html|title=1933 Anti-Nazi Boycott|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1936 Summer Olympics===
As the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] were held in Berlin, Germany there was great controversy over whether or not America should participate. Although it was decided by the US Olympic Committee that America was to participate, this decision was deplored by several American diplomats including [[William E. Dodd]], the American ambassador to Berlin, and [[George Messersmith]], head of the US legation in Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10007087|title=The Movement to Boycott the Berlin Olympics of 1936|website=www.ushmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===German American Bund===
[[German American Bund]] was an organisation of ethnic Germans living in the United States, with a pro Nazi stance. The organisation showed strong admiration for [[Adolf Hitler]] and the Nazi party. They carried out active propaganda for their cause, publishing magazines and brochures, along with the organisation of demonstrations and camps such as the Hitler Youth Camps. Members of the group attended the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin where leader [[Fritz Julius Kuhn]] was photographed with Hitler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005684|title=German American Bund|website=www.ushmm.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group attempted to 'awaken German Americans to Nazism'. They tried non-violent methods such as the infiltration of existing German ethnic clubs and the sponsorship of meetings and rallies. However, violence was inevitable when the Bund tried to take control through intimidating methods. In 1935 when the Wisconsin Federation of German-American societies voted to ban displays of the [[swastika]] at cultural events, members of the Bund threatened anti-Nazi delegates; one of many examples of their attempts to counteract 'Anti-German' movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americainwwii.com/articles/americans-for-hitler/|title=Americans for Hitler - the Bund - America in WWII magazine|website=www.americainwwii.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nazi Propaganda Ideas surrounding Anti-Americanism==
Themes in Nazi Propaganda aimed at America revolved largely around the idea that the United States faced a 'lack of unity.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/johann.htm|title=The Land Without Heart|first=Randall|last=Bytwerk|website=research.calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; America was portrayed by the Nazi party as a regressed nation, one unable of appreciating European culture. Hitler declared America as a "mongrel nation", grown too rich too soon and governed by a capitalist elite with strong ties to the Jews and the Americans were a "mongrel people" incapable of higher culture or great creative achievements.&lt;ref&gt;Klaus P. Fischer (2011). Hitler and America. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt; When giving a speech in reaction to America's negative comments on the Anti Jewish campaigns&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Randall Bytwerk (1998). "Goebbels on the United States (1939)". German Propaganda Archive, http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/goeb28.htm, retrieved 20 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1938, Goebbels mocked the country, commenting on the way they borrowed from other countries, their unemployment rates, lynchings in the country and the economic and political scandals the country had seen. He used these examples to ridicule America as a country and insinuated that America had no right to criticise any other country considering the state that their own was in. In the speech, Goebbels said that 'it is not surprising that the New York press attacks Germany so strongly. Over two million Jews live in New York and public, especially economic life, there is entirely under their control.'&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Goebbels went on to state, in a sarcastic nature: 'Such a nation is certainly justified in sneering at ancient Europe, whose nations and peoples looked back on centuries, even millennia, of cultural achievements long before America was even discovered.' This is an example of the theme discussed earlier about the Nazi party viewing America as a nation whose people did not have the ability to appreciate European culture. The Nazi propagandists blamed President Roosevelt for a lot of America's problems. They thought America was based on political and economic scandal. It was believed that America was too racially diverse and this was what allowed it to be controlled by Jews and Communists. Nazi propagandists also sometimes depicted President Roosevelt as a gangster, and later on in their Anti-American campaign lost all respect for him suggesting in one cartoon that he deserved to be executed.

==Roosevelt and Jewish links==
During the early years of Hitler being in office, he saw Jews as 'an element alien to the German nation' and he saw them as the main cause for all of Germany's problems.&lt;ref name="Herf2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeffrey Herf|title=The Jewish Enemy: Nazi Propaganda During World War II and the Holocaust|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T3EZ50uDlSoC|date=1 July 2009|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-03859-2|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi caricatures often portrayed America to be under Jewish control as a result of Roosevelt's ruling. In several caricatures Roosevelt is depicted as a Jew, or to have Jewish ancestry. This is done through the use of classic anti-Semitic stereotypes such as a hooked nose, hunched back and the use of the [[Star of David]]. Caricatures of this nature tended to appear on the covers of Nazi magazines and newspapers, such as [[Kladderadatsch]]. One image appeared on this magazine with the caption 'President Roosevelt', showing him looking at his reflection in a mirror but seeing himself as a Jew. This supported the common Nazi propagandist theme that Roosevelt was under Jewish control. This was a popular topic for propaganda in the Nazi party and appeared in several other cartoons and caricatures on magazine covers. The theme can be seen in another cartoon on the cover of 'Lustige Blätter' which is captioned 'American candelabra. This again shows how the Nazi propagandists showed Roosevelt to be supportive of Jews.

==Roosevelt and Britain==
Another popular theme in Nazi propaganda against the United States was that of President Roosevelt exploiting Britain. One cartoon entitled 'This lion needs a haircut' shows Roosevelt cutting the hair of the British Lion. The pieces of hair he cuts off represent parts of the Empire such as [[Jamaica]] and [[Trinidad]]. This is used to show how America received British bases in return for the supplies they were giving England during the war. Another cartoon which depicts this theme is captioned "Take the bones to the kitchen. They'll make a good soup!" In this, Roosevelt has eaten the British lion, and is out to get everything he can out of the Empire, showing how the Nazis used America's alliance with Britain as propaganda against President Roosevelt. Both of these cartoons appeared in Lustige Blätter, a weekly German humor magazine. The magazine did not carry caricatures, even friendly ones, of Hitler or other Nazi leaders. There were many caricatures of Winston Churchill, Franklin Roosevelt, and Joseph Stalin.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bytwerk.com/gpa/lustige.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roosevelt and the Second World War==
The Nazi Party portrayed Roosevelt as seeing war as something which he could profit from. They used this as another anti American propaganda method. One cartoon on the cover of [[Kladderadatsch]] entitled "Roosevelt prays for peace" links this idea with the way the Nazi propagandists showed Roosevelt to be under the influence of the Jews. In this cartoon, Roosevelt is saying 'Grant, oh Jehovah, that war does not break out until we can sell weapons again!'. At the time of this cartoon, the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s]] were in place and this prevented the U.S from selling military equipment to Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.calvin.edu/german-propaganda-archive/franklin-roosevelt.htm|title=Nazi Caricatures of FDR|author=|date=|work=calvin.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazi party played on this suggesting that President Roosevelt did wanted war but only if he could profit from it. Another cartoon captioned 'They have their war! Warmonger #1 and his lure Eleanor'. The cartoon says 'Now the hobbling cripple and his ugly wife have what they wanted.' The first lady, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] is often criticised in Nazi caricatures and cartoon propaganda. The fact that the Nazi propagandists portray Roosevelt as wanting to go to war is also helpful to their propaganda campaign at home. The main task of Nazi propaganda, both at home and abroad was to reassure the general public, alarmed at the possibility that Hitler meant war.&lt;ref name="O'ConnorGriffiths2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Brendon O'Connor|author2=Martin Griffiths|title=Anti-Americanism: Historical perspectives|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KF0pySH-ozsC|year=2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-84645-025-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt is the perfect opportunity to deflect the want for war onto a different source and therefore reassure the German people that Hitler was not the reason for war.

==Roosevelt as a gangster==
Roosevelt was often depicted in Nazi propaganda caricatures as a Gangster. One cartoon entitled 'Al Capone's best pupil' shows Roosevelt thanking Capone for his assistance and to let him know if there is anything he can do for him. Here, the Nazi's play on the theme that America was politically corrupt. This cartoon appeared in Lustige Blätter, a weekly magazine, discussed earlier in this article. Another cartoon shows Roosevelt in an electric chair and states that 'the gangster president' is in the president chair where he belongs. This image was featured on the cover of [[Kladderadatsch]].

==Other Nazi propaganda caricatures==
There are several other themes which don't necessarily fit into a particular category that were used by Nazi propagandists against America and Roosevelt. One shows a train named Roosevelt blowing out a lot of steam and making a lot of noise. It reads 'Well, Stalin, if noise were power the machine wouldn't be bad!' This was used to represent the regular Nazi theme that America were all talk and were big mouths that did not follow through on what they said. Another cartoon shows Roosevelt's failure in his [[New Deal]]. He is using his crutches to collect new military bases in Iceland and the Azores. This shows how Roosevelt is trying to find new ways to support himself after his previous plan had failed. Both of these images appeared on the cover of German weekly magazine [[Fliegende Blätter]]. The magazine reached a maximum circulation of around 95,000 copies by 1895 so reached a lot of Germans which was important for the Nazi party to send out their message.

'''The David Plates''' are a set of nine silver plates, in three sizes, stamped between 613 and 630. The plates were created in [[Constantinople]], each depicting a scene from the life of the Hebrew king [[David]], and associated with the reign of Emperor [[Heraclius]] (610-641).&lt;ref&gt;Cormack, Robin. Byzantine Art. Oxford U. Press. 2000.  Print. p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following their discovery in [[Karavas]] (northern [[Cyprus]]) in 1902, the David Plates have been considered key additions to early Byzantine secular art. It is also noted that the David Plates were found amongst the Second Cyprus Treasure. Casual laborers from the village of Karavas found the David Plates as they were quarrying the ruins for construction stones.&lt;ref&gt;Leader, Ruth. The David Plates Revisited: Transforming the Secular in Early Byzantium. The Art Bulletin, Vol. 82, No 3 (Sept. 2000) pgs 407-427. https://www.jstor.org/stable/3051395&lt;/ref&gt; The finders, however, failed to report what they had discovered to the Cypriot authorities. When authorities learned of their taking they confiscated three of the David Plates alongside a pair of cross-monogram plates, and other jewelry held today in the [[Cyprus Museum|Museum of Antiquities]] in [[Nicosia]]. The rest of the discovery was smuggled from Cyprus and traded to a dealer located in [[Paris]]. Most of this hoard was bought by [[J. Pierpont Morgan]] and was later given to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City]] by his heirs in 1917, where they currently remain.

== Large, Center Plate ==

* David battles [[Goliath]]. Size and weight: 19 7/16 x 2 5/8 in., 203.9oz. (49.4 x 6.6&amp;nbsp;cm, 5780g)

== Medium plates ==

* Samuel anoints David in the presence of his father and brothers

* Saul Arms David
* Marriage of David and [[Michal]]

== Smaller plates ==

* David fights lion

* David approached by messenger while playing the harp
* David's Confrontation with [[Eliab]]

== Manufacture ==
The David Plates are of extremely high quality, pointing the source of production to the palace workshops in Constantinople that was known for the manufacture of specific luxury commodities. The plates have control stamps by the Byzantine emperor Heraclius to assure the quality of silver used to make them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Masterwork of Byzantine Art: The David Plates; The Story of David and Goliath|last=Norris|first=Michael|publisher=|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine silver plates were made in three sizes; one large plate, four medium plates and another four small plates.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Suzanne Spain. "Heraclius, Byzantine imperial ideology, and the David plates." Speculum 52.2 (1977): 234.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the form, the plates are similar, with rolled rims, concave surfaces, and a high foot ring.

== Commission ==
The stamps offer an intriguing aspect of relating the David Plates to Heraclius’ rule. It is often thought that the set could have been commissioned to celebrate the defeat of the [[Sasanian Empire]] (628-629) by Heraclius. He managed to end a long war with [[Persia]] and retook control over [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], and other Byzantine regions. Specifically, Heraclius regained the Byzantine territories that included [[Jerusalem]] (founded by King David) and the Sasanian city of [[Ctesiphon]]. The Sasanian War echoed David’s victory over Goliath as he also beheaded his enemy, giving him the acclaim of being the new David. The emperor’s image as the new David par excellence might have been praised to celebrate past achievement as well as promote confidence in the present and future. The last years on the control stamps, therefore, are seen as the most likely for the development of David Plates. It is thought that Heraclius ordered the commission of the David Plates for their intrinsic [[value (economics)|value]]. More aspects are still being studied to point out their true reality in Byzantine art history.

== Relationship with the life of King David ==
Various artists and intellects have established the possible relationship between the plates and the life of King David. The David Plates are associated with the period after the victory of King David over the Persians when Emperor Heraclius was often concerned with his role in history, authority, and image. Other proponents also claim that each plate is associated specifically with King David, from the time [[Samuel]] anointed him to the time he married Saul's daughter. The slight contradictions of the period relating to the plates can be understood since the plates are among the most ancient components of Byzantine art. The explanations that can be retrieved today are only significant regarding the accuracy of the dates established in the writings. The exact periods that the plates describe appear to be contradicting in different writings, but the general information that the writers seek to pass is rather similar. Between 1970 and 1978, there were five readings about the plates, each associated with some deficiencies in information and accuracy in time.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Marvin C. "A Byzantine gold medallion at Dumbarton Oaks." Dumbarton Oaks Papers 11 (1957): 247-261.&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are certain discrepancies in the information that the writers passed, all readings accept the fact that Heraclius had a significant role in the design of the plates. Furthermore, the David plates evoke the significant victories during the reign of Emperor Heraclius.

The '''''Dead Christ Held by Two Angels''''' is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist [[Marco Palmezzano]], finished in 1510. It is housed in the [[Musée du Louvre]] of Paris, France.

The centre of the scene is occupied by the dead figure of Christ, portrayed with great attention to anatomical details, but also with evident religious piety; the brightness of his body is further enhanced by the dark stone, resembling a black cave, depicted in the background. This contrast can also have the allegorical meaning of Jesus leaving sin and death behind his shoulders. Jesus assumes in this way the evangelic role of proclamation of the end of the dark era of humanity, as also remembered by the presence of the two angels.

The work is influenced by those of [[Giovanni Bellini]], which Palmezzano saw in his sojourn in [[Venice]] in 1489–1495.

{{Gospel Jesus}}
 
The '''Descent from the Cross''' ({{lang-el|Ἀποκαθήλωσις}}, ''Apokathelosis''), or '''Deposition of Christ''', is the scene, as depicted in art, from the Gospels' accounts of [[Joseph of Arimathea]] and [[Nicodemus]] taking Christ down from the cross after his [[Crucifixion of Jesus|crucifixion]] ({{bibleverse||John|19:38-42}}). In [[Byzantine art]] the topic became popular in the 9th century, and in the West from the 10th century. The Descent from the Cross is the 13th [[Station of the Cross]].

Other figures not mentioned in the [[Gospels]] who are often included in depictions of this subject include [[St. John the Evangelist]], who is sometimes depicted supporting a [[Swoon of the Virgin|fainting Mary]] (as in [[The Descent from the Cross (Rogier van der Weyden)|the work below by Rogier van der Weyden]]), and [[Mary Magdalene]]. The Gospels mention an undefined number of women as watching the crucifixion, including the [[Three Marys]], ([[Salome (disciple)|Mary Salome]] being mentioned in {{bibleverse||Mark|15:40}}), and also that the Virgin Mary and Mary Magdalene saw the burial ({{bibleverse||Mark|15:47}}). These and further women and unnamed male helpers are often shown.&lt;ref&gt;G. Schiller, ''Iconography of Christian Art'', Vol. II, 1972 (English trans from German), Lund Humphries, London, p.164, {{ISBN|0-85331-324-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of the image==
Even in early depictions the details and posing of the composition, and especially the position of Christ's body, are varied. The scene was usually included in medieval cycles of the Life or the [[Passion of Christ]], between the [[Crucifixion]] and the ''[[Entombment of Christ]]''. The ''[[Lamentation of Christ]]'', or ''[[Pietà]]'', showing the body of Christ held by Mary, may intervene between these two, and is common as an individual image, especially in [[sculpture]]. The ''Bearing of the body'', showing Christ's body being carried to his tomb, and the ''Anointing of Christ's body'', showing the body laid flat on the top of the tomb or a similarly-shaped "anointing-stone" are other scenes that may be shown. This last is especially important in Orthodox art, where it is shown on the [[Epitaphios (liturgical)|Epitaphios]].

With the Renaissance the subject became popular for [[altarpiece]]s, partly because of the challenges of the composition, and the suitability of its vertical shape.  The [[Mannerist]] version of [[Rosso Fiorentino]] is usually regarded as his most important work, and [[Pontormo]]'s altarpiece is perhaps his most ambitious work.  The subject was painted several times by both [[Rubens]] and [[Rembrandt]], who repeated one of his paintings (now in Munich) in a large print, his only one to be mainly [[engraving|engraved]], as well as making two other [[etching]]s of the subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15076">A '''dialect coach''' is an acting [[coaching|coach]] who helps an actor design the voice and speech of a character in the context of an on-camera (film, television or commercial), stage (theatre, musical theatre, opera, etc.), radio or animation [[voiceover]] production. The dialect coach often does original research on dialects and speech patterns, prepares training materials, provides instruction and works on lines with the actor. A dialect coach will give the actor feedback focusing on issues of credibility, consistency, and clarity. A dialect coach may also be employed to help comedians hone impressions of celebrities, to train non-actor public speakers in vocal character and delivery, or to help singers improve in diction and attain a balance between tone and articulation, especially when singing in a second language.

==Terminology==

The term ''dialect coach'' persists as the primary designation for an accent or language coach in the US and Canadian entertainment businesses. However, other designations may also be used. Some dialect coaches will refer to themselves as ''dialogue coaches'' (or, occasionally, by the historical designation, ''dialogue directors''), especially when working on a second language or when offering acting coaching on straight dialogue in the performer's own language or dialect.

In the [[opera]] world, coaches who help opera singers with articulation of lyrics (often in an unfamiliar language, such as Russian, German or Czech) are called ''diction coaches.'' In the United Kingdom, dialect coaches are generally called ''accent coaches'' and are not [[acting coach]]es.

The term ''[[vocal coach|voice coach]]'' is applied to those who work with breathing, voice and text in the theatre in the UK, though this usage is not common in the US film and television businesses where the term "voice coach" would generally be understood to refer to a singing coach (a.k.a., a ''[[vocal coach]]'').

Likewise, on US stage productions the term ''voice coach'' is also avoided to prevent confusion with either a vocal (singing) coach or someone who coaches actors in techniques for inducing a state of heightened relaxation prior to a rehearsal or performance, and who may offer guidance on breath support or vocal practices intended to promote effective placement of resonances in the upper body, the actor's availability of expression and appropriate projection.&lt;ref name="Fitzmaurice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rodenburg" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Linklater" /&gt;

==Activities==
In some cases, voice warm-up coaching integrates full-body work in [[yoga]], movement or balance. Many actors believe that such warm-ups and exercises reduce the likelihood of vocal damage, most especially during expression of high intensity emotion outdoors or in a large performing venue in the absence of electronic amplification (e.g., microphones and a PA system).&lt;ref name="claims" /&gt; A dialect coach may also be engaged to coach voice issues in this latter sense in conjunction with theatrical dialect coaching. Not every dialect coach has the training and knowledge to also do vocal coaching in a singing sense.

==Hiring and management==

===On-camera productions===
On a film or television production, dialect coaches are typically hired by the [[line producer]] during pre-production to begin preparing cast far in advance of the first day of [[principal photography]]. If engaged during principal photography, it is the [[unit production manager]], [[production manager]], [[production supervisor]], [[production coordinator]] or, in some cases, [[executive producer]] who is likely to interview prospective coaches in behalf of the production. If engaged only during post-production, the coach may even be hired directly by the post producer. In advance of being hired, coaches may be interviewed by the [[showrunner]] or a staff writer in the case of episodic television or by the [[film director]] in the case of a feature film. Dialect coaches may work with any members of the cast, but are brought in especially often to work with celebrity actors who have been cast in roles which require accents other than their own or even the performance of dialogue in languages unknown to the actors. Therefore, frequently, the actors themselves will ask Production to hire a particular coach. 

However the coach comes to be hired, the creatives will often consult with the dialect coach early in the process in order to acquaint the dialect coach with the overall creative vision and to start the actor as early as possible to allow time for the character's voice to become fully integrated by the actor prior to the actor's first shoot day. Once hired, the coach will typically prepare actors over a number of sessions either remotely, on set, at the Production Office or in the actor's own home. Coaches who work in serialized television are expected to be especially flexible as there may be no opportunity for a meeting between the episode director and coach, as shooting scripts may not be finalized until very close to the day of the shoot and as last-minute casting decisions and limitations on actor-availability may make it difficult to schedule advance coaching.

During production, the [[key second assistant director]] typically schedules coaching sessions. Many creatives will ask that the coach be present at read-throughs or story conferences, at production meetings (if serving as key coach) and during at least some first-team rehearsals. While a shot is set-up, the coach will be kept in close proximity to the actors to be coached. Often, the coach will be assigned a dressing room, or, on location, a room in the honeywagon, double-banger or triple-banger near the actors' trailers. On set, the dialect coach will be issued a wireless headset and given a chair (exclusive, if on set regularly) in video village in order to facilitate access to the director and to the script supervisor who may be asked by the coach to relay notes on pronunciation and clarity, particularly if the dialogue is in dialect or language unfamiliar to the post-production team. An on-set coach may also work with an actor between takes if needed, especially on last minute changes to the script. Later, the coach may be brought back for dubbing or to pick up new lines during the post-production process, sometimes via a feed from a remote studio when the actors are no-longer available in person.&lt;ref name="Blaise" /&gt;

===Stage productions===
On a stage production, dialect coaches are typically brought in by a director or artistic director with contractual terms negotiated by a producer or general manager. Coaches work closely with the production stage manager who coordinates meetings with the director and coaching sessions for the cast collectively or individually. The coach will often also be present to give notes to the actors at some rehearsals, partial runs and full runs. Coaching typically takes place throughout the rehearsal process, but especially before the actors begin memorizing their lines and again after the show is loaded into the performance space. Understudies may be coached alongside the principal performers or after the show goes into previews. Coaching may continue in a limited way during a run.

==Status and compensation==
In the film and television businesses, dialect coaches are very well paid. Coaches are customarily given on-screen credits for their work on films and for substantial contributions to serialized television. The wording of the credit may vary with the specific requirements of the production. On some shows, dialect coaches may be asked to contribute intellectual property to the production in the form of, for instance, dialogue polishing in English or other languages. They may serve as technical consultants in the areas of culture and written language. They often guide, or engage with, the cast's process of creating a character and consult on the overall vocal design for the production. Consequently, the deal memos for coaches may include compensation terms that are not typical for crew positions, leading to the adage that dialect coaches are neither [[above the line (filmmaking)|above-the-line]] nor [[below the line (filmmaking)|below-the-line]], but on-the-line.

In the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK and the US, dialect coaches remain among a very small minority of production staff who are not unionized; their deals may differ in substance from production to production in these jurisdictions. In Australia and New Zealand, dialect coaches who are employed on a film or theatre set are covered under the [[Media, Entertainment and Arts Alliance]]. On English-language Canadian film and television productions, dialect coaches are unionized under the [[Alliance of Canadian Cinema, Television and Radio Artists]]. Coaches are not unionized under the [[Union des artistes]] for French-language productions in Canada.

In the theater, coaches who help actors hone dialects or character voices typically seek compensation on a par with designers and may be credited as dialect coaches, dialect designers or voice and speech directors. Dialect coaches are not unionized for live performances in Canada, the Republic of Ireland, South Africa, the UK or the US. 

There is no membership branch of the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] that incorporates dialect coaching, nor is there a peer group of the [[Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] that accords active membership status to coaches.

==Cost-cutting for low-budget productions==
Due to budget constraints, producers of student films and stage plays, showcase theater and slimly financed independent films and web series may avoid hiring a dialect coach, and instead substitute the services of a low-paid or volunteer native speaker model in hopes that the actors will be able to learn mimetically, retain the accent and act in it without expert guidance or monitoring. In some such cases, cast members may themselves pay a coach, sometimes in consultation with the director, though employing crew is not normally regarded as a cast member’s responsibility. In other cases, actors may attempt to self-study the dialect using commercially available training materials or web-based voice archives&lt;ref name="IDEA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="VADA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCVoices" /&gt; which host native-speaker recordings of oral histories or interviews or other scripted speech.&lt;ref name="SAA" /&gt; The majority of such archives also provide native-speaker recordings of phonemically balanced narrative passages, especially ''Comma Gets a Cure,''&lt;ref name="Comma" /&gt; which is structured around the [[lexical sets]] of English and other phonological patterns of potential interest to the student of dialect.&lt;ref name="VSR" /&gt;

==Job prospects==
While there are many hundreds of voice and speech trainers connected with drama courses throughout the English-speaking world who may control a stock of ''stage dialects'' for general use, far fewer specialize in dialect coaching. A web search of dialect coaches with [[Internet Movie Database]] listings produces fewer than 100 living film and TV coaches worldwide, the majority showing few recent jobs, credited or uncredited. Most of these dialect coaches work on an ad hoc basis on individual productions. However, in some cases, a coach may become attached to a theatre company as a resident voice and speech director, especially if the coach has a second specialization (esp. [[Shakespeare]] or voice). As with many aspects of the entertainment business, entry into the field of dialect coaching is very competitive. Because dialect coaches are not always called for every day of a shoot, many coaches find a way to supplement income while maintaining their availability for coaching, often by acting, directing (including animation voice directing), teaching in related areas (public speaking, etc.) or taking on private students, especially for auditions.&lt;ref name="Kopf" /&gt; Outside of the entertainment businesses based in English-speaking countries, dialect coaching is less common, and opportunities rarer.

==Professional societies==
Dialect coaches, especially those who teach in theater education programs, may become active in such professional societies as the Australian Voice Association, the British Voice Association, the International Centre for Voice and the Voice and Speech Trainers Association.

[[File:Drafter at work.jpg|thumb|Upright|Traditional drafter at work]]
[[File:Man at drafting table.jpg|thumb|A drafter in Portugal in the 1970s, using a [[drafting machine]] ]]
A '''drafter''', '''draughtsman''' ([[British English]]) or '''draftsman''', '''drafting technician''' ([[American English]] and [[Canadian English]]) is a person who makes detailed [[Technical_drawing|technical drawings]] or plans for machinery, buildings, electronics, infrastructure, sections, etc. Drafters use computer software and manual sketches to convert the designs, plans, and layouts of engineers and architects into a set of technical drawings. Drafters operate as the supporting developers and sketch engineering designs and drawings from preliminary design concepts.

== Overview ==
In the past, drafters sat at drawing boards and used pencils, pens, compasses, protractors, triangles, and other drafting devices to prepare a drawing by hand. From the 1980s through 1990s, board drawings were going out of style as the newly developed computer-aided design (CAD) system was released and was able to produce technical drawings at a faster pace. 

Many modern drafters now use computer software such as [[AutoCAD]], [[Revit]], and [[SolidWorks]]  to flesh out the designs of engineers or architects into technical drawings and blueprints but board drafting still remains the base of the CAD system. Many of these drawings are utilized to create structures, tools or machines. In addition, the drawings also include design specifications like dimensions, materials and procedures.&lt;ref name="AC 2016"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scan2cad.com/cad/autocad-careers|title=AutoCAD Careers – Everything You Need To Know |date=December 19, 2016 |website=Scan2CAD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, drafters may also be casually referred to as CAD operators, engineering draftspersons, or engineering technicians.&lt;ref name="BLC07"&gt;[[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (2008) ''[http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos111.htm ''Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2008–09 Edition:  Drafters]'' dated: 18 December 2007.  accessed: 24 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

With CAD systems, drafters can create and store drawings electronically so that they can be viewed, printed, or programmed directly into automated manufacturing systems. CAD systems also permit drafters to quickly prepare variations of a design. Although drafters use CAD extensively, it is only a tool. Drafters still need knowledge of traditional drafting techniques, in addition to CAD skills. Despite the near global use of CAD systems, manual drafting and sketching are used in certain applications.&lt;ref name="BLC07" /&gt;

Drafters' drawings provide visual guidelines and show how to construct a product or structure. Drawings include technical details and specify dimensions, materials, and procedures. Drafters fill in technical details using drawings, rough sketches, specifications, and calculations made by engineers, surveyors, architects, or scientists. For example, drafters use their knowledge of standardized building techniques to draw in the details of a structure. Some use their understanding of engineering and manufacturing theory and standards to draw the parts of a machine; they determine design elements, such as the numbers and kinds of fasteners needed to assemble the machine. Drafters use technical handbooks, tables, calculators, and computers to complete their work.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;

== Specialities ==
Drafting work has many specialities such as:&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AC 2016"/&gt;

* '''Aeronautical drafters''' prepare engineering drawings detailing plans and specifications used in the manufacture of aircraft, missiles, and related parts.
* [[Architectural drafting|'''Architectural drafters''']] draw architectural and structural features of buildings and other structures. These designs are used in the construction or remodeling of homes, commercial buildings and power stations. These workers may specialize in a type of structure, such as residential or commercial, or in a kind of building material used, such as [[reinforced concrete]], [[masonry]], [[steel]], or [[timber]].
* '''Civil drafters''' prepare drawings and topographical and relief maps used in major construction or [[civil engineering]] projects such as buildings, highways, bridges, [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, flood-control projects, and water and sewage systems.
* '''[[Electrical drafters]]''' prepare [[Wiring diagram|wiring]] and layout diagrams used by workers who erect, install, and repair electrical equipment and wiring in communication centers, [[power plant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, electrical distribution systems, and buildings.
* '''Electronics drafters''' draw wiring diagrams, [[circuit board]] assembly diagrams, [[schematics]], and layout drawings used in the manufacture, installation, and repair of electronic devices and components.
* '''Mechanical drafters''' prepare drawings showing the detail and assembly of a wide variety of machinery and mechanical devices, indicating dimensions, [[fastening]] methods, manufacturing equipment, and mechanical installation infrastructure.
* '''Process piping '''or''' pipeline drafters '''prepare drawings used in the layout, construction, and operation of [[Oil field|oil]] and [[gas field]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, [[refineries]], [[chemical plant]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, and process [[piping]] systems.
* '''Photovoltaic drafters''' prepare drawings showing inverter Pad location drawings and slab construction drawings, also prepare specific [[PV system|photovoltaic system]] assembly details and some [[wiring diagram]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt;.

== Employment and work environment ==
Drafters work in architectural offices, manufacturing companies, engineering firms, CAD-specific work-groups, construction companies, engineering consultancy firms, the government, natural resource companies or are independently self-employed. Drafting technologists and technicians often work as part of a broader multidisciplinary engineering team in support of engineers, architects or industrial designers or they may work on their own. The position of a drafter is one of a skilled assistant to architects and engineers. Drafters usually work in offices, seated at adjustable drawing boards or drafting tables when doing manual drawings, although modern drafters work at computer terminals much of the time. They usually work in an office environment, but some may have to travel and spend time on manufacturing plants or construction sites. As drafters spend long periods in front of computers doing detailed technical work, they may be susceptible to [[eyestrain]], back discomfort, and hand and wrist problems. Most drafters work standard 40-hour weeks; only a small number work part-time.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt;

== Education and training ==
High school courses in English, mathematics, science, electronics, computer technology, [[Technical drawing|drafting]] and [[design]], visual arts, and [[computer graphics]] are useful for people considering a drafting career. Attributes required by drafters include technical writing skills, problem-solving skills, the ability to visualize three-dimensional objects from two-dimensional drawings as well as drawing the relationships between parts in machinery and various pieces of infrastructure. Other skills include an in-depth knowledge of the qualities of metals, plastics, wood and other materials used in the overall manufacturing processes and of construction methods and standards. Technical expertise, a strong understanding of construction and the manufacturing process, and a solid knowledge of drafting and design principles are also important assets in becoming a drafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalschool.ca/3-essential-skills-you-need-to-become-a-successful-cad-technician/ |title=3 Essential Skills You Need to Become a Successful CAD Technician}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the modern job marketplace, in addition to technical skills enabling CAD drafters to draw up plans, soft skills are also crucial as CADD drafter have to communicate with clients and articulating their drawing plans in an effective way with fellow team members in a real-world setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.digitalschool.ca/3-essential-skills-you-need-to-become-a-successful-cad-technician/ |title=3 Essential Skills You Need to Become a Successful CAD Technician}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Employers prefer applicants who have also completed training after high school at a trade or technical school. Prospective drafters will also need to have a strong background knowledge and experience with CADD software. Though licenses aren’t a prerequisite for becoming drafters, the American Design Drafting Association (ADDA) does offer certification and licensing. Licensing and certification highlights one's core competence and knowledge of a specific drafting specialty.Drafting and design certificates and diplomas are generally offered by career training schools, trade and technical schools and non-university higher education institutions like community colleges or industrial training institutes.&lt;ref name="AC 2016"/&gt; 

Apprenticeships combine paid on-the-job training and experience with in-class instruction. People interested in becoming drafters can get qualified as either drafting technologists or drafting technicians. Drafting technologists usually have a 2 to 3-year diploma in engineering design or drafting technology from a community college or technical school.&lt;ref name="BLC07"/&gt; Drafters starting out tend to move from company to company to gain experience and to move up. A more senior drafter often moves up into a management position where they become able to supervise entire projects as they gain more experience or they can start their own business and become self-employed. It is also possible for experienced drafters to enter related fields such as [[engineering]], [[architecture]], [[industrial design]], [[interior design]], [[exhibit design]], [[landscape design]], [[set design]], and [[animation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rileyguide.com/careers/mechanical-drafting-technicians.shtml | title=Mechanical Drafters | publisher=Riley Guide | accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://learn.org/articles/Aeronautical_Drafter_Jobs_Career_and_Salary_FAQs.html | title=Aeronautical Drafter: Career and Salary Facts | publisher=Learn.org | accessdate=29 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drug Master File''' or '''DMF''' is a document prepared by a [[pharmaceutical]] manufacturer and submitted solely at its discretion to the appropriate regulatory authority in the intended drug market. There is no regulatory requirement to file a DMF. However, the document provides the regulatory authority with confidential, detailed information about facilities, processes, or articles used in the manufacturing, processing, packaging, and storing of one or more human drugs. Typically, a drug master file is filed when two or more firms work in partnership on developing or manufacturing a drug product. The DMF filing allows a firm to protect its [[intellectual property]] from its partner while complying with regulatory requirements for disclosure of processing details.

== Description ==
Drug Master File (DMF) is a document containing complete information on an [[Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient]] (API) or finished drug [[dosage form]]. An Active Substance Master File (ASMF) is the currently recognised term in Europe, formerly known as European Drug Master File (EDMF) or a US-Drug Master file (US-DMF) in the United States.

The DMF contains factual and complete information on a drug product's chemistry, manufacture, stability, purity, impurity profile, packaging,
and the [[Good manufacturing practice|cGMP]] status of any human drug product.

A drug master file comprises two parts: the Applicant’s Part (USA: Open Part), which contains all the information that the licence-holder needs to assess the quality and submit a licence or amendment application; and the Restricted Part (USA: Closed Part), which contains confidential information about the manufacturing procedure only disclosed to the authorities.

== DMFs in the United States ==
In the United States, DMFs are submitted to the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA). The Main Objective of the DMF is to support regulatory requirements and to prove the quality, safety and efficacy of the medicinal product for obtaining an [[Investigational New Drug]] Application (IND), a [[New Drug Application]] (NDA),As an [[Abbreviated New Drug Application]] (ANDA), another DMF, or an Export Application.

In United States there are 5 types of Drug Master file:&lt;ref name="FDAguideDMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm122886.htm|title=Guideline for Drug Master Files|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:* Type I Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures and Personnel

:* Type II Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product

:* Type III Packaging Material

:* Type IV Excipient, Colorant, Flavor, Essence, or Material Used in Their Preparation

:* Type V FDA Accepted Reference Information

== DMFs in Europe ==
The content and the format for drug master file used in United States differs from that used in [[List of European countries|European Countries]] to obtain market authorization (MA). The Main Objective of the EDMF is to support regulatory requirements of a medicinal product to prove its quality, safety and efficacy. This helps to obtain a Marketing Authorisation grant.

'''DMF LISTS'''

IMPORTANT NOTE

The current list contains DMFs RECEIVED by March 31, 2012. However the submitted date is listed for each DMF.

The list of DMFs is current as of March 31, 2012, through DMF 25923. Changes to the DMF activity status, DMF type, holder name, and subject made since the last update of January 11, 2012 are included.

The list is available in Microsoft Excel and in ASCII (tab-delimited).

The current lists are posted (1Q2012) as well as the lists from the last quarter (4Q2011) to permit users to compare lists for updates and changes.
'''
TYPES OF DMFs'''

The types of DMFs are:

Type I Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel (no longer applicable)
Type II Drug Substance, Drug Substance Intermediate, and Material Used in Their Preparation, or Drug Product
Type III Packaging Material
Type IV Excipient, Colorant, Flavor, Essence, or Material Used in Their Preparation
Type V FDA Accepted Reference Information
STATUS OF DMFS

“A” = Active. This means that the DMF was found acceptable for filing, administratively, and is up-to-date.
“I” = Inactive
“N” = Not an assigned number
“P” = DMF Pending Filing Review
The status conveys no information about whether DMF has been reviewed for technical content.

'''INACTIVE STATUS OF DMFs'''

There are three reasons to list a DMF as inactive:
* The holder requested that the DMF be closed (or retired, closed, inactivated, or withdrawn) by submitting a closure request.
* The FDA closed the DMF because the holder did not respond to an overdue notification letter within 90 days by updating the DMF.
* The DMF was overdue for update. The FDA considers DMFs submitted before March 31 overdue for update when the company has submitted no annual reports since that date. The FDA considers only an annual report sufficient to prevent them sending an overdue notice letter (ONL).

The status ''Inactive'' in the list does not distinguish among the reasons listed above.

DMFs must be current at the time of review. According to FDA regulations regarding DMFs (21 CFR 314.420(c)):
:''“Any addition, change, or deletion of information in a drug master file (except the list required under paragraph (d) of this section) is required to be submitted in two copies and to describe by name, reference number, volume, and page number the information affected in the drug master file.”''
The Guideline for Drug Master Files (September 1989), recommends that DMF holders update their DMFs annually (see below under Annual reports).

To ensure DMFs are current, the FDA sends ''overdue notification letters'' (ONLs) to DMF holders for DMFs that are overdue for update (see above). If a DMF holder does not respond to this letter within 90 days by submitting an annual report, the FDA considers the DMF ''closed by the FDA,'' and ''retired''.

Note that the FDA has a backlog sending out ONLs. DMF holders can forestall the sending of an ONL by updating their DMFs, following the procedure below under ''Retaining the activity of a DMF.''

===Retiring DMFs===
A DMF can be retired only if it is closed. A retired DMF is unavailable for review.

===Retaining DMF activity===
A DMF holder that wants to retain the activity of a DMF listed as Inactive and not closed must submit an annual report (two copies). This is also the process used to respond to an ONL. The cover letter must specify that it is an ''annual report.''

===Reactivating a closed DMF===
A company can return a closed DMF to active status only by submitting a ''reactivation.'' The reactivation must contain a complete re-submission of the DMF, updated to meet current guidance.

===Guidance===
For drug master files, the version posted on the web is the current version. The address for submitting DMF documentation to the FDA in the Guidance is dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov.

FDA regulations require that all foreign language submissions to INDs and NDAs have complete, accurate translations. The same is true for DMFs. The FDA does not require a [[certified translation]].

===More information about DMFs===
DMF guidance recommendations, in general, still apply. However, the information below provides additional information or clarification in three categories:
* Category 1: Recommendations no longer applicable due to changes in regulations or guidances
* Category 2: Additional clarification of recommendations in the Guidance
* Category 3: New information for DMF filing aspects not in effect when the company wrote the Guidance

Mailing address for filing original DMFs and all subsequent DMF documents (Category 3):
:Food and Drug Administration
:Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
:Central Document Room
:5901-B Amendale Road
:Beltsville MD 20705-1266

Companies send two paper copies of all submissions to an existing paper DMF to the address above. The FDA does not accept submissions via e-mail or CDs. Companies may submitted two-sided copies of DMFs.

===DMF reviews (Category 3)===
When the FDA receives a DMF, they review it for administrative content. This may take 2–3 weeks. If the DMF is acceptable from an administrative point of view, the FDA issues an acknowledgement letter, which notifies the holder of the DMF number. If the FDA finds the DMF not acceptable from an administrative view, they notify the holder of the deficiencies they must correct.

The FDA reviews the DMF for technical information only after the following events occur:

# The DMF holder submits a Letter of Authorization (LOA) in two copies to the FDA. This LOA must contain the DMF number.
# The holder sends a copy of the LOA to the authorized party (customer).
# The customer submits an application to the FDA that contains a copy of the LOA.

===Pre-assignment of DMF Numbers (Category 3)===
The FDA grants requests for preassigned DMF numbers for electronic or paper DMFs. (See ''Requesting a Pre-Assigned Application number.'')

===Format and content of the application's ''Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls'' section (Category 1)===
Companies submit DMFs following the format recommended in the ''Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality.''

===Conversion to Common Technical Document===
Companies may convert an existing DMF in non-CTD format to CTD format. In such cases, the FDA advises DMF holders to submit an amendment that contains all applicable CTD-specified sections to the material in the DMF. Each section must be complete and current. For drug substances and excipients, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.S in Module 3. For drug products, companies must submit all sections of 3.2.P in Module 3. If the reformatting causes changes in the DMFs technical content—e.g., adds new information—the cover letter for the new submission must describe these changes. DMFs in CTD format must follow CTD Guidance, e.g., be paginated within each section. This supersedes DMF guidance.

For conversion of a paper DMF to electronic CTD format, see Electronic DMF.

DMFs that cover multiple items, e.g., Type III DMFs for components of container-closure systems or Type IV DMFs for flavors, can be submitted in CTD format. Technical information can be in Module 3, following the outline in the Drug Substance Section. Sections within 3.2.S. can be populated as appropriate. Each product, such as different flavors, must have a different name—e.g. ''3.2.S.[Flavor 1], 3.2.S.[Flavor 2].'' Information common to different products—e.g., analytical procedures—can be accessed by reference (or links in the case of an Electronic DMF) from the relevant section for that product, e.g., ''3.2.4.2 [Flavor 1].''

DMF holders who submit DMFs for sterile manufacturing can consult the ''Manual of Policies and Procedures 5040.1: Product Quality Microbiology Information in the Common Technical Document - Quality (CTD-Q).'' Companies don't have to file separate sections for the same product manufactured at separate facilities unless the manufacturing processes are different.

Module 1 must contain the following information
Section 1.2: Cover Letter and Statement of Commitment
Section 1.3: Administrative Information

1.3.1 Contact/sponsor/Applicant information
1.3.1.1 Change of address or corporate name
Can be used to supply addresses of DMF holder and manufacturing and testing facilities

1.3.1.2 Change in contact/agent
Can be used to supply the name and address of contact persons and/or agents, including Agent Appointment Letter.
1.4.1 - Letter of Authorization (LOA)
Submission by the owner of information, giving authorization for the information to be used by another. An Agent Appointment Letter is NOT an LOA and should not be called “Letter of Authorization” and should not be submitted in Section 1.4.1
1.4.2 - Statement of Right of Reference
Submission by recipient of a Letter of Authorization with a copy of the LOA and statement of right of reference. Submitted in a DMF only when another DMF is referenced.
1.4.3 - List of authorized persons to incorporate by reference
This list should be submitted in DMF annual reports.
Section 1.12.14 Environmental Analysis: See Environmental Assessment

The language in the following sentence in the DMF Guidance, Section VII.B.1, has confused some DMF holders:

:''“A DMF is required to contain a complete list of persons authorized to incorporate information in the DMF by reference [21 CFR 314.420(d)].”''
It does not mean to say that a company must list all individuals in the DMF holder’s company who are authorized to submit information to the DMF.

The language in the CFR is clearer:

:''“The drug master file is required to contain a complete list of each person currently authorized to incorporate by reference any information in the file, identifying by name, reference number, volume, and page number the information that each person is authorized to incorporate.”''

==Types of DMFs==
'''&lt;u&gt;Type I DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

The FDA no longer accepts Type I DMFs, per a final rule published on January 12, 2000 (65 FR 1776). See Type V DMFs below.

Holders of Type II, III, and IV DMFs must not place information regarding facilities, personnel, or general operating procedures in these DMFs. They should only submit DMF holder addresses, manufacturing sites, and contact personnel. See ''Administrative Information in a DMF.''

'''&lt;u&gt;Type II DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

For Type II DMFs filed in CTD-Q format, the FDA expects Module 2.

Drug Substance
Type II DMFs for drug substances may be submitted in the format for "Drug substance" in the "Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality".(Category 3) Drug Substance:
See the current Guideline for Submitting Supporting Documentation in Drug Applications for the Manufacture of Drug Substances.
It is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.S.4.3.
See also the DRAFT ICH Guidance “Q11 Development and Manufacture of Drug Substances
Drug Product:
Type II DMFs for drug products may be submitted in the format for "Drug product" in the "Guidance for Industry M4Q: The CTD - Quality".(Category 3) Drug Product.
See the Guideline For Submitting Supporting Documentation In Drug Applications For The Manufacture Of Drug Products.
It is not necessary to include a Methods Validation Package (3.2.R.3). Methods Validation information should be submitted in Section 3.2.P.5.3.

Examples of drugs that would be classified as Type II DMFs include Amifostine, Caffeine, Desonide Micro, Ibuprofen Softgels, Viatmin E Oil, and Zinc Gluconate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type2|title=DMF Type II Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Separate DMFs should be submitted for drug substances and drug products.

'''&lt;u&gt;Type III DMFs (Category 1)&lt;/u&gt;'''

The applicable Guidance for Type III DMFs is the “Guidance for Industry: Container Closure Systems for Packaging Human Drugs and Biologics: Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls Documentation” and Questions and Answers. (Category 3)

A Manual of Policies and Procedures covering reviewer responsibilities for review of Type III DMFs has been implemented. MAPP 5015.5 CMC Reviews of Type III DMFs for Packaging Materials This MAPP instructs reviewers to look for information regarding many packaging materials in the application (IND, NDA, ANDA) for the drug product that utilizes the packaging material before reviewing the DMF. Much of the information needed for review can be provided directly to the applicant for inclusion in the application, thereby avoiding the need to review the DMF.

Examples of products that would be classified as Type III DMFs include bottles, seals, dispensers, and vials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type3?lang=en|title=DMF Type III Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Type IV DMFs (Category 3)&lt;/u&gt;'''

Type IV DMFs should be used for products such as excipients, colorants, flavors, essences, or other materials used in product preparation. Examples of materials that would use a Type IV DMF include bases, waxes, and edible inks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type4?lang=en|title=DMF Type IV Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See relevant section in the Guideline for Drug Master Files. Toxicology studies may be submitted in the same DMF as the CMC information but they should be in a separate volume or volumes. It is preferable for holders to submit such information as a separate Type V DMF. See also the “Guidance for Industry: Nonclinical Studies for the Safety Evaluation of Pharmaceutical Excipients
Type V DMFs (Category 3)

The following types of DMFs may be filed as '''&lt;u&gt;Type V DMFs&lt;/u&gt;''' without requesting prior clearance from FDA.

Manufacturing Site, Facilities, Operating Procedures, and Personnel for sterile manufacturing plants. See Guidance for Industry for the Submission Documentation for Sterilization Process Validation in Applications for Human and Veterinary Drug Products.
Contract Facilities for the manufacture of biotech products. See Draft Guidance for Industry: Submitting Type V Drug Master Files to the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research
For other submissions as Type V DMFs the holder must request permission from FDA before filing a Type V DMF. (21 CFR 314.420(a)(5)). Prospective Type V DMF holders may send their request to dmfquestion@cder.fda.gov, explaining the necessity for filing the information in a Type V DMF.

Examples of sites and procedures that would require Type V DMFs include clinical studies, sterilization facilities, and toxicological information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.registrarcorp.com/fda-drugs/dmf-examples/type5?lang=en|title=DMF Type V Examples {{!}} Registrar Corp|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Administrative Information in a DMF''' (Category 3)

The only elements of the administrative information that should be in a DMF are:

The name and address of the holder
The name and address of manufacturing facility
For the contact person:
Name
Mailing Address
Telephone number
Fax number
E-mail address
Statement of Commitment
The name and address of the agent (if applicable)
For the contact person at the agent (if applicable):

Submission of Amendments, Annual Reports, and Letters of Authorization(Category 3)

To facilitate processing of documents that are submitted to an existing DMF, please list the Submission Type and the Category/Subcategory of the Amendment (Supporting Document) in bold type in the header on the transmittal letter. See list below. More than one Submission Type/Category/Subcategory can be used but all must be listed.

Example: If updated stability data is submitted at the same time as an Annual Report, the heading of the Cover Letter should state:

Annual Report
Original: Quality/Stability

FDA’s database is structured as follows:

Application:
Submission
Amendment (called "Supporting Document") in the database)
Amendments (Supporting Documents) are named by a Category and Subcategory

For the Application Type “Drug Master File” the Submission Types are

Original: Information containing changes to technical information are filed in the “Original” submission. For Categories and Subcategories, see list below. Note that a new DMF does not need a “Category” designation by the holder.
Annual Report: There are no Amendments (Supporting Documents) Categories and Subcategories
Letter of Authorization: There is only one Category with two Subcategories:
Letter of Authorization
Withdrawal of Authorization
Categories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in General Information
Category: Closure Request
Category: Reactivation (Used only when a DMF has been Closed.)
Category: Administrative

Subcategories under Administrative Category
change in the holder name
change in holder address
change in ownership of the DMF (either internal name change, or change in ownership)
change in the agent name or address.
change in the contact person at the holder or agent.
change in the subject of the DMF.
change in the type of DMF
Categories of Amendments (Supporting Documents) in Original Submission:

Category: Quality

Subcategories under Quality Category (with corresponding CTD Sections, where applicable).

Changes to a Subsection e.g. changes in Control of Materials (S.2.3) not specifically listed below should be reported as the next level up e.g. should be reported as Manufacture Information S.2.

New item: Additional item e.g. flavor added to a multi-item DMF
Controls Information (specifications) S.4 and P.5
Dissolution Data (Usually applies to drug product only) P.5
Facility Information (changes in manufacturing and or testing sites) S.2.1 and P.3.1

Packaging Information (Applies to packaging of the material that is the subject of the DMF e.g. plastic bags for packaging a bulk drug substance in a Type II DMF) S.6 and P.7
Stability Information S.7 and P.8
Response to Information Request
Response to Deficiency Letter

Category: Non-clinical
Non-clinical
Carcinogenicity Information
A response to an Overdue Notice Letter (ONL) to retain activity of a DMF MUST be identified as an Annual Report (with additional amendments as applicable) and contain the information listed below for an Annual Report. Responses to ONLs that are not labeled as Annual Reports or that state that an update will be submitted in the future are NOT sufficient to keep the DMF in active status.

FDA does not acknowledge, whether via e-mail or letter, any submission after the original DMF.

Submissions that cover multiple DMFs MUST have a copy submitted for each DMF.

When a company changes one part of a DMF, they should not resubmit the entire DMF. For DMFs in CTD format, the company should resumbit the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires that the company resumbit ''Section S.2.3.''

All submissions must be paginated within the submission. For DMFs in CTD format, the company only resubmits the entire changed “Document” (Section)—e.g., a change in the material used in the synthesis requires resubmitting ''Section S.2.3.''

Pages that replace an already-numbered page from a previous submission should also contain the page number in the current submission (e.g. a page replacing Page 10 in the original submission may be page 14 in the new submission). For DMFs in CTD format, only the pages within the changed “Document” (Section) are subject to re-numbering.`

No pages are ever physically replaced in a DMF.

===Electronic DMFs (Category 3)===
At this time, the FDA doesn't ''require'' that companies file DMFs electronically. They continue to accept paper DMFs. Beginning May 5, 2017 new DMFs and submissions to existing DMFs must be submitted using the eCTD standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/FormsSubmissionRequirements/ElectronicSubmissions/UCM511231.pdf |title=Forms|website=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; See Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD)'

All electronic submissions must have a pre-assigned number to populate in the US regional.xml. If a company converts a paper DMF to electronic format, they don't need to request a pre-assigned number.

See also Guidance for Industry: Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format—Human Pharmaceutical Product Applications and Related Submissions Using the eCTD Specifications. To make sure you have the most recent versions of the specifications referenced in this guidance please check Electronic Common Technical Document (eCTD). Companies are encouraged to submit their DMFs in electronic form, including updating current paper DMFs. Note that all applications to CDER, including DMFs that are submitted in electronic format MUST be in ECTD format, unless a waiver is granted. Waivers are not granted for DMFs.

All Letters of Authorization for electronic DMFs should specify that the DMF has been submitted in electronic format. A company may not submit an electronic resubmission to a paper DMF unless they resubmit the entire DMF in electronic format. Companies may convert an existing DMF in paper format to electronic format (ECTD only). See “Conversion to CTD” above.

The ECTD format provides the backbone for the submission, and a guide as to where to place information. Companies need not submit all modules, nor submit all sections within a module. However, the FDA requires Module 1 for all eCTD submissions, as it contains the administrative information that identifies the DMF. Electronic signatures are accepted for electronic DMFs.

===Letters of authorization (Category 2)===
The company must submit two copies of all letters of authorization (LOAs) to the DMF. The DMF holder must then send a copy of the LOA to the authorized party (company or individual authorized to incorporate the DMF by reference). Failure to submit the LOA to the DMF may delay review of the DMF. LOAs must specify the name of the specific item referenced, and the date of the submission of information about that item. The LOA must not be called a ''letter of access.'' An LOA is required, even if the DMF holder is the same company as the authorized party.

Companies must not submit LOAs with original paper DMFs, because the LOA must contain the DMF number. Therefore, DMF holders must wait to submit an LOA until they receive an acknowledgment letter with the DMF number. An LOA can be submitted with the original DMF if the DMF has received a pre-assigned number. It is not necessary to reissue LOAs if there have been no changes in the holder, authorized party, subject of the DMF or item referenced.

If the holder or authorized party changes names, whether this represents a change in ownership or not, they should submit new LOAs to the DMF and copies sent to the authorized party.

LOA Template
AGENTS (Category 2)

There is no regulatory requirement for an agent for any DMF, foreign or domestic. An agent for DMF purposes is not the same as an agent for the purposes of the Drug Listing and Registration System. (DRLS). Holders should not include the name of the agent for Registration purposes in the DMF. Also note that in the US, the process of “Registration” applies ONLY to “registering” an establishment with the FDA.

All “Agent Appointment Letters” for DMFs MUST be sent by the holder. FDA recommends that such letters include the phrase “appoint AGENT NAME as the agent for DMF” rather than “authorize AGENT NAME to act as the agent for DMF,” since the latter can be confused with a “Letter of Authorization.”
An “Agent Appointment Letter” may be included in an original DMF.

If possible, the word “Agent” should be used for the legal entity (whether a company or an individual) who is authorized to act on behalf of the DMF holder. The word “Representative” should be used for an individual who is employed by the Agent or Holder as the contact point for FDA.

If a company acting as an Agent changes its name, FDA recommends that the DMF holder issue a new Agent Appointment Letter.

A different agent can be appointed for different DMFs submitted by the same holder.

Agent Appointment Template
HOLDER NAMES (Category 2)

When the company that owns a DMF (DMF holder) changes its name, whether through sale of the company or simply a change in the company’s name, the DMF holder must notify FDA. See Section VII.E. in the Guideline for DMFs for further recommendations on the procedure for transferring ownership. A change in the name of a company for registration purposes under DRLS will not change the DMF holder name.

When a DMF is transferred from one company to another, the original holder should submit an administrative amendment stating that they are TRANSFERRING the DMF to the new holder. The new holder should then submit an administrative amendment stating that they are ACCEPTING the DMF from the former holder.

If the DMF holder changes its name and there is no transfer of ownership, the holder may submit a single Holder Name Change amendment.

A DMF holder is expected to retain a complete reference copy that is identical to, and maintained in the same chronological order as, their submissions to FDA (See Section IV.D.1 in the Guideline for DMFs). Therefore, the old owner of the DMF is expected to transfer that copy to the new owner of the DMF.

If a holder name change affects multiple DMFs, all documentation must be submitted to each DMF as separate submissions.

In general, the FDA expects that the manufacturer is the holder. If a manufacturer (company A) of a material wants another company (Company B) to submit the DMF, and Company B wishes to act as the holder—the DMF must include statements from both companies that Company B is responsible for all information in the DMF, and for all processes and testing performed by the manufacturer. The title of the DMF that appears on the list of DMFs is the format ''Material manufactured in [LOCATION OF COMPANY A] for [COMPANY B].''

ANNUAL REPORTS (Category 2)

According to the DMF Guideline, companies must not use annual reports to report changes in the DMF. However, as described above, companies can submit an annual report at the same time as other information. The annual report must contain (for cover letter see Templates below):

1. An administrative page that contains:

: Holder name
: Manufacturing site name if different from holder
: U.S. agent company name (if applicable)
: Name of contact person for each of the above
: Mailing address, phone number, fax and email address of responsible individuals
: AND 2. One of the following

: Date(s) of the amendment(s) reporting changes since the last Annual Report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.

: Or

: A statement that no amendments have been submitted since the last Annual Report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.
: And

: 3. One of the following:

: A complete list of all parties authorized to make reference to the DMF, identifying by name, reference number, volume, date, and page number the information that each person is authorized to incorporate

: Or

: A statement that no changes have been made to the list of authorized parties since the last annual report or the original DMF filing date, whichever is most recent.

: Or

: A statement that there are no authorized parties.

: And 
: 4. List of all parties whose authorization has been withdrawn

Note that the DMF Guidance uses the terms “Annual Update” and “Annual Report” interchangeably. All submissions of Annual Reports should be labeled “Annual Report.” The term “Annual Update” should not be used.

Note that the annual report must list the authorized parties. If the list is long and the holder wants to list only authorized parties added since the last annual report, they should highlight this in the cover letter. There should be a statement that there have been no changes in the list of authorized parties previously submitted.

BIOLOGICS MASTER FILES (Category 3)

Master Files submitted in support of products regulated by the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) must be submitted as BB-MFs. See the CBER web site for the products regulated by CBER.

 BINDERS (Category 2)

See ”FDA IND, NDA, ANDA, or Drug Master File Binders
“The “binders” are actually covers. These may be ordered from the

U.S. Government Printing Office (GPO)
Washington, DC 20404-0001
(202) 512-1800

In addition these can be ordered online using the following links

Red Binder
Blue Binder
One copy of the DMF should use the blue cover and one should use the red cover.

Fasteners must be obtained separately. Use 2 Piece Prong Fasteners, 8 1/2" Center to Center, 3 1/2" Capacity. Binders should be used for all subsequent submissions to FDA that are more than 10 pages.

FEES (Category 3)

There are no fees or charges for filing a DMF or any subsequent documents.

FORMS (Category 2)

Certain forms are required for submission of NDAs and INDs. However, there are no forms required or available for DMFs, except for the forms discussed above under Binders.

CONFIDENTIALITY OF DMFs (Category 2)

The public availability of the contents of DMFs is covered in 21 CFR 314.430(e). All requests for information about DMFs beyond that provided in the tables above must be made through the CDER Freedom of Information Web site.
FILING DMFs AND PATENT EXPIRATION AND EXCLUSIVITY ISSUES (Category 2)

DMFs may be filed at any time. The Patent Expiration date and the Exclusivity Expiration dates listed in the Orange Book have no impact on DMF filing. The submission of Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) that reference DMFs are subject to the regulations regarding filing of ANDAs.

ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENTS (Category 2) Since DMFs are neither approved nor disapproved, there is no need to file an Environmental Assessment. However the DMF should contain a commitment by the firm that its facilities will be operated in compliance with applicable environmental laws.

REORGANIZATION OF A DMF (Category 1)
The advice in the Guidance does not apply. It is not necessary to consult with FDA before reorganizing a DMF.

REQUEST FOR CLOSURE OF A DMF BY THE HOLDER (Category 2).

It is not necessary to include a statement that "the holder's obligations as detailed in Section VII have been fulfilled," as recommended in the DMF Guidance. It is sufficient to include a statement that all of the parties authorized to reference the DMF have been notified that the DMF is being closed..

LETTER TEMPLATES AND COVER LETTERS (Category 2)

Note that a “Transmittal Letter” and a “Cover Letter” are the same thing.

Cover Letter for Original DMFs
Cover Letter for Subsequent Amendments and Annual Reports (Not applicable to Holder Transfer, New Holder Acceptance, Holder Name Change, Letter of Authorization, and Closure Requests)

Cover Letter for Reactivation of a Closed Drug Master File
The following Letters do not require a Cover Letter

Holder Transfer
New Holder Acceptance
Holder Name Change
Letter of Authorization
Closure Request
Withdrawal of Authorization

The 2012 book, ''Toward Global (Environ)Mental Change - Transformative Art and Cultures of Sustainability'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.boell.de/en/content/toward-global-environmental-change&lt;/ref&gt; proposes that the global crisis of unsustainability is a disruption of the ''hardware'' of civilization, as well as a crisis of the ''software'' of the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kagan|first1=Sacha|title=Toward Global (Environ)Mental Change - Transformative Art and Cultures of Sustainability|date=2012|publisher=Heinrich Böll Siftung|location=Berlin|isbn=9783869280769|url=https://www.boell.de/en/content/toward-global-environmental-change|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 book, ''Ecological aesthetics: art in environmental design: theory and practice'', presents an analysis of a variety of tendencies and approaches to landscape architecture, science and theory that inform research and the transformation of the landscape for over thirty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prigann|first1=Herman|last2=Strelow|first2=Heike|last3=David|first3=Vera|title=Ecologcial aesthetics: art in environmental design: theory and practice|date=2004|publisher=Basel [etc.]: birkhauser|location=Switzerland|isbn=3764324244|url=http://library.wur.nl/WebQuery/clc/1870135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Arts Web,&lt;ref&gt;http://greenarts.org/reference.html&lt;/ref&gt; compiled by [[Carnegie Mellon University]] senior librarian, Mo Dawley, is a compendium of core readings on contemporary environmental art, ecological art and theory (20th century to the present) that includes, among other sub-categories, for example,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Green Arts Web|title=Green Arts Web: Reference (Multidisciplinary)|url=http://greenarts.org/ref2.html#culture|website=greenarts.org|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[deep ecology]] practices;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Deep Nature (16 article special section)|journal=Studio Potter|date=December 1990|volume= 19|pages=18–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macy|first1=Joanna|last2=Fleming|first2=Pat|title=The Council of All Beings in Alan Drengson &amp; Yuichi Inoue, The Deep Ecology Movement: An Introductory Anthology|date=1995|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Naess|first1=Arne|title=Deep Ecology and the Potters in (sic) Our Planet|journal=Studio Potter|date=June 1992|volume= 20|pages=39–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ecofeminism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Diamond, ed.|first1=Irene|last2=Orenstein, ed.|first2=Gloria Ferman|title=Reweaving the World: The Emergence of Ecofeminism|date=1990|publisher=Sierra Club Books|location=San Francisco}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warren|first1=Karen J.|title=Feminism and Ecology: Making Connections|journal=Environmental Ethics|date=1987|volume=9|issue=1|pages=3–20|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19879113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zimmerman|first1=Michael E.|title=Feminism, Deep Ecology, and Environmental Ethics|journal=Environmental Ethics|date=1987|volume=9|issue=1|pages=21–44|doi=10.5840/enviroethics19879112}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ecopsychology]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shepard|first1=Paul|title=Nature and Madness|date=1998|publisher=The University of Georgia Press|location=Athens}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[land ethic]] and [[bioregionalism]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leopold|first1=Aldo|title=A Sand County Almanac, and Sketches Here and There|date=1987|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sense of place]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lippard|first1=Lucy|title=Lure of the Local: Senses of Place in a Multicentered Society|date=1997|publisher=New Press|location=New York|isbn=9781565842489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kwon|first1=Miwon|title=One Place after Another: Site-Specific Art and Locational Identity|date=2004|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780262612029}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baum|first1=Kelly|title=Nobody's Property: Art, Land, Space, 2000-2010|date=2010|publisher=Princeton University Art Museum, Distributed by Yale University Press|location=Princeton, New Jersey|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[systems thinking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capra|first1=Fritjof|title=The Web of Life: A New Scientific Understanding of Living Systems|date=1996|publisher=Doubleday|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burnham|first1=Jack|title=Great Western Salt Works: Essays on the Meaning of Post-Formalist Art|date=1974|publisher=George Braziller|location=New York|isbn=9780807607404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orientations==
Contemporary ecological art has been articulated across interdisciplinary and scholarly groups in terms of life-centered issues, community participation, public dialogue, and ecological sustainability. In 1996, the educator and activist, Don Krug identified concepts frequently addressed by ecological artists that can be used by to interpret ecological perspectives and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=University of British Columbia, Department of Curriculum &amp; Pedagogy|title=Don Krug, Research Interests|url=http://edcp.educ.ubc.ca/faculty-staff/don-krug/|website=UBC Faculty of Education|publisher=EDCP|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following four orientations were identified: Environmental Design, Ecological Design, Social Restoration, and Ecological Restoration.

*[[Environmental design]] – Some artists work with nature as a resource for particular aesthetic endeavors. Artists with an orientation to environmental design are interested in achieving particular formal aesthetic effects. In the 1980s and 90s, artists, architects, designers, and civil engineers explored ways to link art, aesthetics, ecology, and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Neperud|first1=Ronald W.|last2=Hochman|first2=Maria|title=Environmental Design|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/envdesign.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum.org|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ecological design]] –   Artists who work in the area of ecological design create art that is contingent on direct experiences and interactions with a particular place where the art is created. An ecological view of design considers the artwork within larger contexts of how people, plants, and animals are interconnected with each other, the site, and/or the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krug|first1=Don|title=Ecological Design|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/ecodesign.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum.org|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Social restoration – An ecological ethic where humans live in relationship to larger communities of life to catalyze socially responsible artwork. Socio-ecological artists critically examine everyday life experiences. These artists scrutinize relations of power that produce community tensions about ecological issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Garber|first1=Elizabeth|title=Social Restoration|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/socrestore.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum.org|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ecological restoration]] – Some artists attempt to alert viewers to environmental issues and problems through scientific exploration and educational documentation. They seek to restore fragile places and educate the public to the systemic character of bioregions through the use of communication, ritual, and performance. Some ecological artists engage people directly in activities or actions by confronting environmentally unhealthy practices with social, ethical, and moral ecological concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krug|first1=Don|title=Ecological Restoration|url=http://greenmuseum.org/c/aen/Issues/ecorestore.php|website=Art &amp; Ecology: Perspectives and Issues|publisher=Greenmuseum|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eileen Barnes''' (1876–1956) was a notable and highly acclaimed botanical artist, well known for her definitive and accurate depictions of Ireland's plant life.&lt;ref name="Lucey"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lucey|first1=John|title=Eileen Barnes (1876–1956): the contributions of a gifted artist, scientific illustrator and model-maker to Irish natural history|journal=Irish Naturalists' Journal|year=2015|volume=34|issue=2|pages=113–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Butler&gt;{{cite book|last1=Butler|first1=Patricia|title=Irish Botanical Illustrators &amp; Flower Painters|date=2000|publisher=Antique Collectors' Club|location=Suffolk|isbn=9781851493579|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Eileen Barnes was born in 1876 in her parent's home at 137 Great Britain Street (now [[Parnell Street]]), Dublin. She was the youngest child of Edwin and Elizabeth Barnes (née McKay). Her father was a grocer and wine merchant who had premises on Great Britain Street and at 57 [[Camden Street, Dublin|Camden Street]]. Barnes attended Rutland School for Girls in Dublin, going on to enrol in the [[Dublin Metropolitan School of Art]] in 1898 and 1899. She appears to have received an Art Teacher's Certificate in 1899. Immediately after leaving the School of Art Barnes worked as a governess in [[County Tipperary]], teaching the two daughters of Anna Maria Cooper-Chadwick.&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;

==Career==
She spent most of her career working with the [[National Museum of Ireland]]'s natural history and antique's division, helping the naturalist [[Robert Lloyd Praeger]] and botanist [[Matilda Knowles]], as well as creating models for the museum's exhibits.&lt;ref name="Proffitt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Creese|first1=Mary R. S.|last2=Creese|first2=Thomas M.|title=Ladies in the Laboratory 2|date=2004|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0810849798|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her association with the [[Natural History Museum (Ireland)|Natural Museum]] in Dublin appears to have begun in 1907, when she is recorded as donating models of the eggs of a platypus. By 1909 she appears to be working in the museum, setting up exhibition cases, constructing models of natural habitats, and wax models. Many of these examples, such as the rock pool and mammal displays that are still exhibited on the ground floor of the Natural History Museum, are believed to be her work. Her formal position within the Museum is unclear, with her at times being referred to as a staff member or the "Museum Artist".&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desmond|first1=Ray|title=Dictionary of British And Irish Botantists And Horticulturalists Including plant collectors, flower painters and garden designers|date=1994|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|location=London|isbn=0850668433|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barnes illustrated [[cephalopod]]a for [[Annie Massy]], such as those collected by the 1910-1913 British Antarctic expedition. She undertook similar illustration work for the sponge expert, [[Jane Stephens]], illustrating a number of her publications. She also illustrated the [[Foraminifera]] collected during the [[Clare Island Survey]].&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt; Her work was highly regarded by Praeger, who even went as far as to name one of his plants after her (''Sedum barnesianum'').&lt;ref name="Butler" /&gt; Barnes' works have been featured in numerous books and monographs, and still highly regarded today, especially her ''sedums'' ([[stonecrop]]s) and ''sempervivums'' ([[house leek]]s).&lt;ref name="Proffitt"&gt;{{cite book|last=Proffitt|first=Pamela|title=Notable Woman Scientists|date=1999|publisher=Gale Group Inc.|location=27500 Drake Rd., Farmington Hills, MI 48331-3535|isbn=0-7876-3900-1|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked with [[Robert Francis Scharff]] to reconstruct and illustrate specimens of the [[Giant Irish deer]]. Barnes also undertook some cartographic work with the [[Geological Survey of Ireland]], and restoration of archaeological artefacts from the [[Royal Irish Academy]].&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt; She also assisted [[Mary Eily de Putron]] when she was working at the museum.

Barnes was a member of the Dublin Naturalists' Field Club from 1913. It is believed she collected specimens of [[lichen]], with one specimen found in the herbarium of the Irish [[National Botanic Gardens (Ireland)]].&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;

==Later life and death==
Barnes retired from her work with the Museum at some point after March 1947, though continued to restore artefacts on behalf of the Museum into the 1950s. She lived with her mother and siblings until their deaths. None of her five siblings who reached adulthood married, meaning that Barnes had no close family when she died in 1956. Neither Barnes birth or death was officially registered, with her date of death remaining undocumented until 2015. She was admitted to [[Sir Patrick Dun's Hospital]] on 13 February 1956, undergoing an operation to "extensive burns" on 27 February. She later died on 12 March, and was buried alongside her siblings Herbert and Edith on 14 March 1956.&lt;ref name="Lucey" /&gt;

'''Gilan mausoleum''' ({{lang-az|'''Gilan türbəsi'''}}) is a monument located on the slope of a hill in Ordubad district of Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic in the territory of Kharabagilan habitation. The mausoleum was discovered accidentally by the local population in 1979.&lt;ref name="naxcivanxeberleri"/&gt; The top tower of the tomb is destroyed, but the tomb is in satisfactory condition.

==Architectural features==
The plan of the tomb is octagonal internally, and rectangular externally. Inside of the monument there is a low pavement that does not fit with the envoirment of the interior. The tomb of the Gilan mausoleum differs from the octagonal tombs of medieval architecture that are spread in Azerbaijan and neighboring countries.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan|2008|с=142,143}} Center of cover of the Gilan mausoleum is supported by mushroom-shaped - expanding upward column in center of the interior. The column is also octagonal in the plan.

General composition of Gilan mausoleum is in a style with the  XII century mausoleums of Central Azerbaijan, especially the Red Dome mausoleum. The Gilan mausoleum was built of layers of broken rock fragments from surrounding rocks. Unlike its interior, exterior of the monument is neatly built. In the interior the ceiling and floors are completely, as well as spaces between stones of the wall and central support are plastered with white solution. Dark gray stone cuttings and roughness creates natural decorative order. Expression of the interior of the tomb is based on the pure volume structure of the shapes.&lt;ref&gt;Salamzadə Ə.V., Məmmədzadə K.M., Azərbaycan memarlığının Naxçıvan məktəbi abidələri. Baku, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside, on the upper layer of tomb a cubicle body was raised. The top tower was completely built of brick and decorated with geometric ornaments made from bricks. The corner of the body were covered with cylindrical brick columns.{{sfn|National Academy of Sciences of Azerbaijan|2008|с=142,143}} The bottom part of one of these columns remains. In decoration of the monument, blue glazed bricks were used as well.

==Research== 
There is no evidence of the time of the mausoleum construction. However, according to the architectural features mentioned above, it is possible to predict the period of the tomb of Gilan for architectural patterns and geometric patterns. The architectural style of the Gilan mausoleum is in same line with the architectural style of the churches built in the XII century in Central Azerbaijan. Gilan mausoleum can be dated back to the XII century as a result of absence of inscription.&lt;ref name="naxcivanxeberleri"&gt;{{cite web|title= Gilan türbəsi|url= http://naxcivanxeberleri.com/gilan-turbəsi/|publisher= kataloq.gomap.az|language= az|accessdate=22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Falconry Book of Frederick II 1240s detail falconers.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Detail of two [[falconry|falconers]] from the Medieval ''[[De arte venandi cum avibus]]'', c. 1240]]
'''Human uses of birds''' have included both economic uses such as food and symbolic uses such as art, music and religion, for thousands of years.

In terms of economic uses, birds have been hunted for food since [[Palaeolithic]] times. They have been captured and bred as [[poultry]] to provide meat and eggs since at least the time of ancient Egypt. Some species have been used, too, to help locate or to catch food, as with [[cormorant fishing]] and the use of [[greater honeyguide|honeyguides]]. Feathers have long been used for bedding, as well as for [[quill pen]]s and for [[Fletching|fletching arrows]].
Today, many species face [[habitat loss]] and other threats caused by humans; [[bird conservation]] groups work to protect birds and to influence governments to do so.

Birds have appeared in the mythologies and religions of many cultures since ancient [[Sumer]]. For example, the dove was the symbol of the ancient [[Mesopotamian goddess]] [[Inanna]], the [[Canaan]]ite mother goddess [[Asherah]], and the Greek goddess [[Aphrodite]]. [[Athena]], the Greek goddess of wisdom, had a [[little owl]] as her symbol, and, in ancient India, the [[peacock]] represented [[Mother Nature|Mother Earth]]. Birds have often been seen as symbols, whether bringing bad luck and death, being sacred, or being used in [[heraldry]]. 
In terms of entertainment, [[Bird of prey|raptors]] have been used in [[falconry]], while [[aviculture|cagebirds]] have been kept for their [[bird vocalization|song]]. Other birds have been raised for the traditional sports of [[cockfight]]ing and [[pigeon racing]]. [[Birdwatching]], too, has grown to become a major leisure activity.
Birds feature in a wide variety of art forms, including in [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[poetry]] and [[prose]], [[film]] and [[fashion]]. [[Birds in music|Birds also appear in music]] as well as traditional [[dance]] and [[ballet]]. In certain cases, such as the [[bird-and-flower painting]] of China, birds are central to an artistic genre.

==Context==

[[Culture]] consists of the [[social behaviour]] and [[Norm (social)|norms]] found in [[human]] [[society|societies]] and transmitted through social [[learning]]. [[Cultural universals]] in all human societies include expressive forms like [[art]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[ritual]], [[religion]], and [[technology|technologies]] like [[tool|tool usage]], [[cooking]], [[shelter (building)|shelter]], and [[clothing]]. The concept of [[material culture]] covers physical expressions such as technology, architecture and art, whereas immaterial culture includes principles of [[social organization]], [[mythology]], [[philosophy]], [[literature]], and [[science]].&lt;ref name=MacionisGerber2011&gt;{{cite book |url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |title=Sociology |last=Macionis |first=John J. |last2=Gerber |first2=Linda Marie |date=2011 |publisher=Pearson Prentice Hall |isbn=978-0137001613 |page=53 |accessdate=29 May 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170818045455/https://www.worldcat.org/title/sociology/oclc/652430995 |archivedate=18 August 2017 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This article describes the roles played by birds in human culture, so defined.

==Economic uses==

Birds are important economically, providing substantial amounts of food, especially protein, largely but not exclusively from the domestic chicken;&lt;ref name=Adler/&gt;&lt;ref name=CIWF/&gt; feathers and down are used for bedding, insulation, and other purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sheikh |first1=Farhan |title=Poultry feathers-how many ways they can be used for? |url=http://thepoultryguide.com/uses-of-chicken-feathers/ |website=The Poultry Guide |date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===As food===

[[File:Egyptian - Vase in the Shape of a Duck - Walters 48421 - Profile.jpg|thumb|left|Ducks were common in [[Ancient Egypt]], as depicted in this 3rd century BC [[faience]] vase.]]

[[Birds]] were among the wild animals hunted for food before the [[Neolithic revolution]] and the development of agriculture. For example, in the [[Epipaleolithic]] of the [[Levant]], between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both [[waterfowl]] and [[bird migration|migratory birds]] were eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cummings |first1=Vicki |last2=Jordan |first2=Peter |last3=Zvelebil |first3=Marek|title=The Oxford Handbook of the Archaeology and Anthropology of Hunter-Gatherers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Nl2yAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239 |year=2014 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-102526-6 |page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared to the energy expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example, waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kelly, Robert L. |title=The Lifeways of Hunter-Gatherers: The Foraging Spectrum |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CDAWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA53 |year=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-02487-8 |pages=53–56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battery hens -Bastos, Sao Paulo, Brazil-31March2007.jpg|thumb|upright|Battery hens: [[poultry]] is a major source of food, the [[chicken]] alone providing 20% of the world's animal protein.&lt;ref name=Poultry/&gt;]]

Birds have been [[domestication|domesticated]] and bred as [[poultry]] for use as food for at least four thousand years. The most important species is the [[chicken]]. It appears to have been domesticated by 5000 BC in northeastern China, likely for cockfighting, and only later used for food.&lt;ref name=Adler&gt;{{cite news |title=How the Chicken Conquered the World |author1=Adler, Jerry |author2=Lawler, Andrew |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-the-chicken-conquered-the-world-87583657/ |newspaper=Smithsonian Magazine |date=June 1, 2012 |accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Egypt]], poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and then bred in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=1998 |author=Manuelian, Peter der |title=Egypt: The World of the Pharaohs |location=Cologne, Germany|publisher=Könemann |isbn=3-89508-913-3 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chicken now provides some 20% of the animal protein eaten by the world's human population in the form of meat and [[egg]]s. [[Poultry farming|Chickens are often raised intensively]] in [[battery farm]]s; this facilitates production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds.&lt;ref name=CIWF&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/chickens/egg-laying-hens/ |title=About egg laying hens |publisher=Compassion in World Farming |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other species including [[ducks]], [[geese]], [[pheasants]], [[guineafowl]] and [[turkeys]] are significant economically around the world.&lt;ref name=Poultry&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Poultry |url=http://www.poultryclub.org/poultry/history-of-poultry/ |publisher=The Poultry Club of Great Britain |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less commonly raised species such as the [[ostrich]] are starting to be farmed for their meat, which is low in [[cholesterol]]; they have also been kept for their feathers, and for leather from their skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Shanawany |first1=M.

Birds are hunted in many countries around the world. In the developed world, ducks such as [[mallard]], [[wigeon]], [[shoveler]] and [[teal]] have for centuries been captured by [[waterfowl hunting|wildfowlers]], while pheasants, [[partridges]], [[driven grouse shooting|grouse]], and [[snipe]] are among the terrestrial birds that are [[hunting|hunted]] for sport, generally with guns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Marchington |first1=John |title=History of Wildfowling |date=1980 |publisher=A &amp; C Black |isbn=978-0-713-62053-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other parts of the world, traditional subsistence hunting still continues, as in rural Northern Papua, where [[cassowaries]], [[crowned pigeon]]s, [[hornbill]]s and [[megapode]]s are captured for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pangau-Adam |first1=Margaretha |last2=Noske |first2=Richard |editor1-last=Tideman |editor1-first=Sonia |editor2-last=Gosler |editor2-first=Andrew |title=Wildlife Hunting and Bird Trade in Northern Papua (Irian Jaya), Indonesia |work=Aboriginal stories: The riches and colour of Australian birds |date=2010 |publisher=Earthscan|pages=74–85 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Tim_Whiteside/publication/236596667_Aboriginal_stories_The_riches_and_colour_of_Australian_birds/links/0046352d335d8135ea000000/Aboriginal-stories-The-riches-and-colour-of-Australian-birds.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seabird]]s such as [[Muttonbirding|muttonbirds]], [[penguin]]s and [[auks]] have been hunted for food, formerly with sufficient intensity to threaten many populations and to make some, such as the [[great auk]], extinct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Simeone, A.  |author2=Navarro, X. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2002 |title=Human exploitation of seabirds in coastal southern Chile during the mid-Holocene |journal=Rev.

===Assisting hunters and gatherers===
[[File:Greater Honeyguide, Gambia.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Some peoples in Africa are guided to the nests of wild bees by the [[greater honeyguide]].]]

The archaeological and historical records suggest interdependence between humans and [[vulture]]s for millions of years. Like other animal species, early [[hominin]]s probably used these birds as beacons signalling the location of meat, in the form of [[Cadaver|carcasses]], in the landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morelli |first=F. |last2=Kubicka |first2=A. | last3=Tryjanowski |first3=P. | last4=Nelson |first4=N. |year=2015 |title=The vulture in the sky and the hominin on the land: three million years of human-vulture interaction |journal=Anthrozoos  |volume=28 |issue=3 |pages=449–468 |doi=10.1080/08927936.2015.1052279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cormorant fishing]] is a traditional fishing method in which trained [[cormorant]]s are used to catch fish in rivers. Historically, cormorant fishing has taken place in [[Japan]] and [[China]] since about 960 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Jackson | first1 = C.

[[File:LA2-NSRW-3-0536 cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Darwin]] noted that [[Pigeon fancying|pigeon fanciers]] had created many kinds of pigeon, such as [[Tumbler pigeon|Tumblers]] (1, 12), [[Fantail pigeon|Fantails]] (13), and [[Pouter pigeon|Pouters]] (14) by [[selective breeding]].&lt;ref name=Secord/&gt;]]

[[Aviculture|Cagebirds]] such as [[domestic canary|canaries]], [[budgerigars]], [[cockatoo]]s, [[lovebird]]s, [[quail]]s, [[finch]]es, and [[parrot]]s are popular [[pet]]s, whether for their song, their behaviour, their colourful plumage, or their [[talking bird|ability to mimic speech]].

The nature writers Mark Cocker and [[Richard Mabey]], reviewing people's love of birds, observe that people are touched by feelings for birds in a variety of ways, such as enjoying the [[northern lapwing|lapwing's]] "joyous display",&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cocker |first1=Mark |last2=Mabey |first2=Richard |author2link=Richard Mabey |title=Birds Britannica |titlelink=Birds Britannica |date=2005 |publisher=Chatto &amp; Windus |isbn=0-7011-6907-9 |pages=ix–x, 436–437 and passim}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the "beauty and mystery" of the [[tawny owl]]'s call on a cold winter's night.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; They argue that people feel the simple companionship of birds, are inspired by them to create art, let them mark the seasons and provide a sense of place, and use them "as symbols of joy and love".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A former statesman, [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon]], was able to express his feeling for birds in his 1927 book ''The Charm of Birds''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Grey, Edward |authorlink1=Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon |title=The Charm of Birds |date=1927 |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such feelings, in turn, have stimulated the intention to conserve birds and their habitats.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; Around the same time as Grey was writing, the first conservation organisations were coming into being, starting in Britain, triggered by the rapid disappearance of familiar species as they were captured for their feathers or for food.&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; A substantial folklore rich in symbolism has accrued around birds; it was documented early in the 20th century as something that was already fading from memory. For example, the [[house sparrow]] has been associated with "sex and lechery"&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt; since ancient Egypt, where libidinousness was written with the sparrow hieroglyph. In the same vein, in the classical era the sparrow was sacred to the goddess of love, [[Aphrodite]] or [[Venus (goddess)|Venus]]; the sparrow features in an erotic poem by Catullus for the same reason. [[Chaucer]] describes the summoner in his ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' as being as "lecherous as a sparwe".&lt;ref name=CockerMabey2005/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ingersoll |first1=Ernest |title=Birds in Legend, Fable, and Folklore |date=1923 |publisher=Longmans Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Armstrong |first1=Edward A. |title=The Folklore of Birds|date=1958 |publisher=Collins ([[New Naturalist]] series)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have shown how important birds are to individual societies, touching on all aspects of life. In Andean societies such as the [[Moche culture|Moche]] (1–800 AD), [[Nazca people|Nazca]] (100–700 AD) and [[Chimu]] (1150–1450 AD), bright parrot and macaw feathers were traded from the Amazon rainforest to the mountains and the Pacific coast, while guano was collected as a fertiliser, and artists and craftsmen were inspired to create textiles, metal jewellery, and ceramics depicting condors, cormorants, ducks, hummingbirds, owls, vultures, and waders. Their religions, too, endowed birds with symbolic meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds of the Andes |url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/bird/hd_bird.htm |publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Audubon society]], reviewing the importance of birds in 2013, obtained statements from many people with differing perspectives.

The writer [[David Allen Sibley]] observed that birds bring a little wildness into parks and gardens.&lt;ref name=Audubon/&gt; The writer [[Barbara Kingsolver]] noted that birds are part of life on earth. The actress [[Jane Alexander]] wrote "Birds remind us that there are angels."&lt;ref name=Audubon/&gt; The forensic ornithologist Carla Dove noted that birds are biological indicators of habitat health, climate change, and the coming of spring.&lt;ref name=Audubon&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Do Birds Matter?|url=http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2013/why-do-birds-matter|publisher=Audubon|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds have sometimes served as religious symbols.

In Medieval Christian iconography, the [[cormorant]]'s "wing-drying" pose represents the Christian cross, and hence is a figure of Christ. In [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', on the other hand, the bird's cross-like pose is a travesty of Christ: "Then up he flew, and...

(2006). ''Extinct Birds of New Zealand'', Te Papa Press, Wellington {{ISBN|978-0-909010-21-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Persian mythology, the [[simurgh]] was a gigantic bird, the first to come into existence, and it nested on the tree of plant life that grew in the great ocean beside the tree of immortality.

In [[Chinese painting|Chinese art]], [[bird-and-flower painting]] forms one of the three major subjects (the others being landscapes and figures), from the time of the [[Five Dynasties]] in the 10th century. [[Huang Quan (painter)|Huang Quan]] created the naturalistic ''xiesheng'' style for bird paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bird Painting |url=http://www.chinaonlinemuseum.com/painting-birds.php |website=China Online Museum |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Birds have long been celebrated in the [[Japanese art|arts of Japan]], including in painting, woodblock printing, cloisonné, ceramics and indeed poetry from the 18th and 19th centuries. Print artists like [[Utamaro]] and [[Hokusai]] made use of Western and Chinese influences to give a sophisticated effect, while [[Hiroshige]] reworked the traditional bird-and-flower genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Birds in Japanese Art and Poetry |url=http://www.worcesterart.org/exhibitions/past/birds_in_japanese.html |publisher=Worcester Art Museum |accessdate=13 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poetry====

Birds have been celebrated in [[poetry]] since ancient times, when for example the Roman poet [[Catullus]] wrote in one of his most famous works about a girl and her pet [[sparrow]] in ''[[Catullus 2|Passer, deliciae meae puellae]]'', "Sparrow, delight of my girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Phillimore, J.S. |title=Passer: Catull.

Birds featured in medieval poetry, for example forming the characters of the 1177 Persian poem ''[[The Conference of the Birds]]'', where the birds of the world assemble under the wisest bird, the [[hoopoe]], to decide who is to be their king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Conference of the Birds |author=Attar, Farid al-Din |authorlink=Farid al-Din Attar |editor1=Darbandi, Afkham |editor2=Davis, Dick |publisher=Penguin Classics |date=1984 |isbn=978-0-14-044434-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In English romantic poetry, [[John Keats]]'s 1819 "[[Ode to a Nightingale]]" and [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s 1820 "[[To a Skylark]]" are popular classics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brooks |first=Cleanth |last2=Warren |first2=Robert Penn |title=The ''Ode to a Nightingale'' |work=Keats's Odes |editor-first=Jack |editor-last=Stillinger |pages=44–47 |publisher=Prentice-Hall |year=1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last=Sandy | first=Mark | title=To a Skylark | encyclopedia=The Literary Encyclopedia | date=2002 | url=http://www.litencyc.com/php/sworks.php?rec=true&amp;UID=7305 | accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bird poems by [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] include "Sea and Skylark" and "[[The Windhover]]" (on the kestrel).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopkins |first1=Gerard Manley |title=Poems and Prose |date=1985 |publisher=Penguin Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afjmf6TpHagC&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227|isbn=9780140420159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Ted Hughes]]'s 1970 collection of poems about a bird character, "[[Crow (poetry)|Crow]]", is considered one of his most important works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |title=Crow – The Ted Hughes Society Journal |publisher=The Ted Hughes Society |date=2012 |accessdate=22 April 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702124543/http://www.thetedhughessociety.org/crow.htm |archivedate=2 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Collins |first1=Billy |title=Bright Wings|date=2010|publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-231-15084-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, birds have appeared in books illustrated by some exceptional artists, producing images that were accurate and beautiful, and that made use of the latest available printing techniques. The [[wood engraver]] [[Thomas Bewick]]'s 1797–1804 ''[[A History of British Birds]]'' brought affordable illustrations to the public for the first time, and the book formed in effect the first [[field guide]] to birds,&lt;ref name=Uglow&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/oct/14/art.biography | agency=[[The Guardian]] | title=Small wonders | date=14 October 2006 | accessdate=12 January 2013 | author=Uglow, Jenny |authorlink=Jenny Uglow}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Newcastle"&gt;{{cite web|title=1st December – The Partridge|url=https://blogs.ncl.ac.uk/speccoll/tag/thomas-bewick/|publisher=Newcastle University|date=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[John James Audubon]]'s enormous&lt;ref&gt;The first [[Book size|double elephant folio]] edition was 39.5 inches high by 28.5 inches wide. {{cite web |url=http://minniesland.com/prints/audubon_folio_birds_havell.htm |title=Prints: Audubon's Folio Birds Havell Edition (1827-1838) |publisher=minniesland.com |accessdate=27 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and impressive images of birds in his 1827–1838 ''[[Birds of America (book)|Birds of America]]'' are among the most admired by art critics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smart |first1=Alastair |title=The best birds in art |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/10816680/The-best-birds-in-art.html |accessdate=22 April 2016 |agency=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by collectors: early editions fetch among the highest prices paid for any printed books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/dailychart/2010/12/books | work=The Economist | title=Book value | date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ornithologist [[John Gould]]'s bird illustrations, in books such as ''A Century of Birds hitherto unfigured from the Himalaya Mountains'' (1830–1833) with 80 plates, and his 7-volume ''The Birds of Australia'' (1840–1848) with 600 plates, related directly to his research, were both beautiful and scientifically useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Karen S.|title=John Gould: Bird Illustration in the Age of Darwin|url=https://exhibits.lib.ku.edu/exhibits/show/gould/about/kucollections|publisher=University of Kansas Gould Collections|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds are popular characters in children's books, which are often handsomely illustrated. [[Beatrix Potter]]'s 1908 ''[[The Tale of Jemima Puddle-duck]]'' created an enduringly popular bird heroine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Taylor, Judy |year=1996 |origyear=1986 |title=Beatrix Potter: Artist, Storyteller and Countrywoman |publisher=Frederick Warne |isbn=0-7232-4175-9 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors followed with many bird characters in books for children of different ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Lewis |first1=Gill |title=Gill Lewis's top 10 birds in books |url=https://www.theguardian.com/childrens-books-site/2014/jul/31/top-ten-birds-childrens-books-gill-lewis |work=The Guardian |date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In books for adults, birds may have symbolic or psychological significance. For instance, [[Paul Gallico]]'s 1940 ''[[The Snow Goose: A Story of Dunkirk]]'' was a parable about the regenerative power of friendship in wartime; the goose symbolises both the hero, Rhayader, a wounded artist, and the world wounded by war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/dec/19/winter-reads-snow-goose-paul-gallico |author=Allardice, Lisa |title=Winter reads: The Snow Goose by Paul Gallico |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[T. H. White]]'s 1951 ''The Goshawk'' describes the author's "monstrous and often cruel battles" to train his bird of prey, while [[Helen Macdonald (writer)|Helen Macdonald]]'s 2014 ''[[H is for Hawk]]'', which references White's book, tells how her obsession with the same species as a falconer helped her through the loss of her father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Cooke |first1=Rachel |title=H is for Hawk review – Helen Macdonald's taming of a goshawk called Mabel reads like a thriller |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/04/h-is-for-hawk-review-helen-macdonald-taming-goshawk-mabel |work=The Guardian |date=4 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Music====

[[File:Léon Bakst 001.jpg|thumb|upright|Ballerina in ''[[The Firebird]]'' by [[Léon Bakst]], 1910]]

[[Birds in music|In music]], [[birdsong]] has influenced composers and musicians in several ways: they can be inspired by birdsong; they can intentionally imitate bird song in a composition, as [[Antonio Vivaldi|Vivaldi]] and [[Beethoven]] did, along with many later composers; they can incorporate recordings of birds into their works, first seen in the work of [[Ottorino Respighi]]; or as [[Beatrice Harrison]] did in 1924 with a [[nightingale]], and [[David Rothenberg]] did in 2000 with a [[laughingthrush]], they can duet with birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Head, Matthew |title=Birdsong and the Origins of Music |journal=Journal of the Royal Musical Association |volume=122 |issue=1 |year=1997 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1093/jrma/122.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clark, Suzannah |year=2001 |title=Music Theory and Natural Order from the Renaissance to the Early Twentieth Century |journal=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-77191-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ledger&gt;{{cite news |last=Reich |first=Ronni |title=NJIT professor finds nothing cuckoo in serenading our feathered friends |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2010/10/njit_professor_finds_nothing_c.html |accessdate=19 June 2011 |newspaper=Star Ledger |date=15 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two groups of scientists, namely Luis Felipe Baptista and Robin A. Keister in 2005, and Adam Tierney and colleagues in 2011, have argued that [[birdsong]] has a similar structure to music. Baptista and Keister argue that the way birds use variations of [[rhythm]], relationships of [[musical pitch]], and combinations of [[musical note|note]]s is somewhat musical, perhaps because some birds exploit variation in song to avoid monotony, or [[mimicry|mimic]] other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Baptista |first1=Luis Felipe |last2=Keister |first2=Robin A. |title=Why Birdsong is Sometimes Like Music |journal=Perspectives in Biology and Medicine |date=2005 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=426–443 |doi=10.1353/pbm.2005.0066 |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/article/185549}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tierney argues that the similar motor constraints on human and avian song drive these to have similar song structures, including "arch-shaped and descending melodic contours in musical phrases", long notes at the ends of phrases, and typically small differences in pitch between adjacent notes.&lt;ref name=Tierney&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tierney |first1=Adam T. |last2=Russo |first2=Frank A. |last3=Patel |first3=Aniruddh D. |title=The motor origins of human and avian song structure |journal=PNAS |date=2011 |volume=108 |issue=37 |pages=15510–15515 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1103882108 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/108/37/15510.full.pdf |pmid=21876156 |pmc=3174665}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds feature as central characters in [[dance]] traditions around the world.
For example, [[Goldie's bird of paradise]] is celebrated in Papua New Guinea in a "beautiful"&lt;ref name=LeCroy&gt;{{cite journal |last1=LeCroy |first1=Mary |last2=Kulupi |first2=Alfred |last3=Peckover |first3=W.

It is performed on important occasions, carrying "special magic",&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt; and the performers are obliged to prepare for a week, avoiding certain foods, and undergoing a prolonged submergence in a cold stream to prepare their minds. The dance is preceded by a "magic chant" to the bird of paradise.&lt;ref name=LeCroy/&gt;
In [[Balinese dance]], the [[Cendrawasih (dance)|cendrawasih]] dance illustrates the [[bird-of-paradise]]'s mating rituals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Tari Cendrawasih Keelokan Gerak dan Busana |trans-title=Cendrawasih Dance: The Beauty of Costume and Movement |language=Indonesian |work=Pikiran Rakyat  |url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |date=12 February 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6TtXit61n?url=http://www.pikiran-rakyat.com/node/269737 |archivedate=7 November 2014 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Africa, the [[Ewe people]] of Ghana, who were said to have been guided from Dahomey to Ghana by a bird, incorporate the flapping of the bird's wings in dances such as ''Agbadza'', ''Atsiagbekor'', and ''Gakpa''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welsh-Asante |first=Kariamu |title=African Dance: An Artistic, Historical, and Philosophical Inquiry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnsWhJGkXo8C&amp;pg=PA14 |year=1996 |publisher=Africa World Press |isbn=978-0-86543-197-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ballet]], [[Tchaikovsky]]'s classical 1895 ''[[Swan Lake]]'' and [[Igor Stravinsky]]'s 1910 ''[[The Firebird]]'' have central bird characters.&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Roland John. ''Tchaikovsky's Ballets: Swan Lake, Sleeping Beauty, Nutcracker''. Oxford University Press 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The dramatic arts====
[[File:Alabastron (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ancient Greek]] bird: an [[alabastron]], 600 BC]]

In [[theatre]], [[Aristophanes]]'s 414 BC [[Greek comedy|comedy]] ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Ὄρνιθες}} ''Ornithes'') is an acclaimed fantasy with effective mimicry of birds. The play's chorus consists of characters playing many identifiable species, including the [[kingfisher]], [[Streptopelia|turtledove]], and [[Eurasian sparrowhawk|sparrowhawk]]; birds feature as messengers and dancers, and several Athenians are compared to specific birds.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: The Birds and Other Plays''. Barrett, D.; Sommerstein, A. Penguin Classics, 1978, page 149&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Greek Drama''. [[Peter Levi|Levi, Peter]] in 'The Oxford History of the Classical World'. Boardman, J.; Griffin, J.; Murray, O. (eds), Oxford University Press, 1986, page 178&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[film]], birds can feature as the major driving force in a story, as in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s acclaimed 1963 ''[[The Birds (film)|The Birds]]''. Loosely based on [[Daphne du Maurier]]'s [[The Birds (story)|story of the same name]], it tells the tale of sudden attacks on people by violent flocks of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=David |authorlink=David Thomson (film critic) |title='Have You Seen…?'

The film is based on [[Barry Hines]]'s 1968 novel ''[[A Kestrel for a Knave]]'', and tells the story of a young boy who [[Bildungsroman|comes of age]] by training a [[kestrel]] that he has taken from the nest.&lt;ref name=BFI&gt;{{cite web |title=Kes (1969) |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b6adf17e2 |publisher=[[British Film Institute]] |accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birds feature also in the mass media with iconic [[animated cartoon]] characters such as [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Donald Duck]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Blitz | first=Marcia | title=Donald Duck | year=1979 | publisher=[[Harmony Books]] | isbn=0-517-52961-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]]'s [[Tweety Pie]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Hartl |first1=John |title=Warner Bros. cartoons get respect, with Museum of History &amp; Industry show |url=http://www.seattletimes.com/entertainment/movies/warner-bros-cartoons-get-respect-with-museum-of-history-industry-show/ |work=The Seattle Times |date=21 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Walter Lantz]]'s [[Woody Woodpecker]].

Effects are not all negative; for example, [[wind farm]]s produce [[renewable energy]], helping to mitigate the single greatest threat to birds, climate change. But, especially if wind farms are poorly sited, they may affect bird populations through disturbance, direct or indirect habitat loss, and collisions. Well sited wind farms benefit birds; poorly sited ones can [[Bird migration perils|kill many birds]] in collisions.&lt;ref name=RSPBwindfarms/&gt; For example, at the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm|Altamont Pass]] in California, the [[golden eagle]] has been reduced by 80%, and nesting has ceased in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=DRIESSEN: Big Wind tax credit exterminates endangered species |author=Paul Driessen |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2012/dec/22/big-wind-tax-credit-exterminates-endangered-specie/ |newspaper=[[Washington Times]] |date=22 December 2012 |quote=In an 86-square-mile area blanketed by the Altamont wind facility, no eagles have nested for more than 20 years even though the area is prime habitat, Mr. Wiegand says.

Governments and [[conservation biology|conservation]] groups work to protect birds, either by passing laws that [[In-situ conservation|preserve]] and [[ecological restoration|restore]] bird habitat, or by establishing [[Ex-situ conservation|captive populations]] for reintroductions. Such projects have produced some successes; one study estimated that conservation efforts saved 16 species of bird that would otherwise have gone extinct between 1994 and 2004, including the [[California condor]] and [[Norfolk parakeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1017/S0030605306000950 | last1=Butchart | first1=S. | last2=Stattersfield | first2=A. | last3=Collar | first3=N. | year=2006 | title=How many bird extinctions have we prevented? | url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/news/2006/08/butchart_et_al_2006.pdf | journal=Oryx | volume=40 | issue=3| pages=266–279 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The British [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the [[egret]] from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rspb.org.uk/about/history/index.asp |title=History of the RSPB |publisher=[[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] |accessdate=19 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more specialised organisation, the [[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] founded in 1946, works to conserve waterfowl and their [[wetland]] habitats, with projects around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our projects |url=https://www.wwt.org.uk/conservation/wwt-projects/ |publisher=[[Wildfowl &amp; Wetlands Trust]] |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jazz dance''' is the performance dance technique and style that emerged in America in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Mahoney, Billie. "Jazz Dance." The International Encyclopedia of Dance. : Oxford University Press, 1998. Oxford Reference. 2005. Date Accessed 20 Mar. 2018 &lt;/ref&gt; Jazz dance began as an African American social dance that had roots in African slave dances. Over time, a clearly defined jazz genre emerged, changing from a [[street dance]] to a theatrical dance performed on stage due to the work by artists such as [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]], [[Bob Fosse]], [[Eugene Louis Faccuito]] and [[Gus Giordano]].

==History==
[[File:Congo Square, Armstrong Park, New Orleans, USA2.jpg|thumb|Congo Square]]
[[File:Basic Charleston.png|thumb|Charleston dance]]
[[File:Sweet Charity - Premijera 04.JPG|thumb|Sweet Charity - Bob Fosse choreography]]
The origins of jazz dance can be traced back to the African ritual and celebratory dances from around the eighteenth century. These dances had an emphasis on rhythm, groundedness, and a connection to the earth. They were traditionally done to the beat of African drums such as [[djembe]]s, ashikos, and bougarabous. Also, from the sixteenth to the nineteenth century, the [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slave trade]] brought ten million Africans and their dances across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. By 1817 in New Orleans, city laws "restricted gatherings of enslaved people to Sunday afternoons in Congo Square, then called Place Publique".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neworleanshistorical.org/items/show/745|title=Congo Square: Mythology and Music - Stop 5 of 7 on the Urban Slavery and Everyday Resistance tour {{!}} New Orleans Historical|website=New Orleans Historical|language=en|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sunday afternoon meetings often included the music and dance from the birthplaces of the slaves. The gatherings at Congo Square were shut down and brought back multiple times during the 1800s; when the meetings were shut down, they continued in secret.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

In the early 1900s in New Orleans, the new music was combining elements of blues and ragtime. Although the term "jazz" first appeared in print in 1910, [[Jelly Roll Morton]], a New Orleans pianist, claims that he invented jazz in 1902.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.howjazzworks.com/index.php/what-is-jazz|title=How Jazz Works|last=Clayton|first=Audrey|website=www.howjazzworks.com|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, jazz pianist Spencer Williams wrote a song called "Shim-Me-Sha-Wabble" which inspired a jazz dance called the "[[shimmy]]". The shimmy is done by holding the body still "except for the shoulders, which are quickly alternated back and forth". In the same year, jazz music began to spread and became well known in Chicago and New York. This led to the jazz age, which is considered to be from 1920 to 1929. A few of the great musicians in the jazz age were [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Bix Beiderbecke]], and [[Benny Goodman]]. The dances that emerged during this period were the Charleston and the [[Lindy hop]]. The Charleston is "characterized by its toes-in, heels-out twisting steps".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/Charleston-dance|title=Charleston {{!}} dance|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can be done as a solo or with any number of people. The Lindy hop was a wild and spontaneous partner dance that was extremely rhythmically conscious. When the Great Depression began in October of 1929, many people turned to dance. Because of this, the Charleston and the Lindy hop are now considered to be under the umbrella term "swing dance" because they were most popular during the swing era of music (1935-1945).{{fact|date=August 2018}}

The 1930s were also the start of jazz dance being combined into live musical theatre shows and movie musicals. A few of the prominent musical theatre choreographers were Jerome Robbins, Jack Cole and Michael Kidd. They created the dances for ''West Side Story'', ''Gypsy'', ''Seven Brides for Seven Brothers'', and many more. These three choreographers and many of the other important figures in jazz dance choreographed and performed between 1930 and 1980. [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]] has his roots in modern and ballet, but he later became known as the father of jazz dance. His style is described as "hip, hard, and cool".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.danceheritage.org/treasures/cole_essay_levine.pdf|title=Jack Cole (1911-1974)|last=Levine|first=Debra|date=|website=Dance Heritage Coalition|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gus Giordano]] is another key dancer/choreographer. Giordano founded his own company and established the Giordano technique. Another amazing jazz choreographer and dancer that founded a jazz technique was Lynn Simonson. Her technique, unsurprisingly, was called the Simonson technique. She emphasized organic movement with a connection to the music. Lastly, [[Bob Fosse]] developed his signature style of jazz dance. He, like some of the previously mentioned choreographers, worked in the musical theatre business. His brand was a "combination of vaudeville, striptease, magic shows, nightclubs, film and Broadway musicals, all based on social dance".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Over the last 20 years, jazz has evolved and has been defined. There are now many subcategories of jazz that each have their own distinct qualities and characteristics. The style and choreographers that I have mentioned thus far are considered to be a part of ‘classic jazz.’ This jazz is currently seen in companies like [[Giordano Dance Chicago]] and Jazz Roots Dance Company. It is also primarily done to jazz music from the early to mid-1900s. Contemporary jazz became well known because of shows like ''[[So You Think You Can Dance]]''. [[Mia Michaels]]' earlier work exemplifies this style. Some other companies and choreographers that create contemporary jazz dance are [[Sonya Tayeh]], [[Mandy Moore (choreographer)|Mandy Moore]], and [[Hubbard Street Dance Chicago]]. Commercial jazz, which has been popular since the ‘80s, combines aspects of hip hop and jazz and is often done to pop music. This style can be seen in the music videos of [[Janet Jackson]] and [[Paula Abdul]]. Lastly, commercial jazz often includes more "tricks." Commercial jazz and contemporary jazz are both seen at dance competitions. Another variety of jazz is Latin jazz. "Maria Torres developed and popularized the fusion at Broadway Dance Center".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dancespirit.com/the-jazz-breakdown-2326335865.html|title=The Jazz Breakdown|date=2014-04-01|work=Dance Spirit|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Latin jazz has an emphasis on the movement of hips and isolations. It can be seen in the films ''El Cantante'' and ''Dance With Me'', as well as on TV dance shows.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Latin jazz incorporates "polyrhythms, angularity, [and] groundedness".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;"Discussing the Prime Tenets of Jazz Dance in Relationship to Current Practices." 3 Aug. 2013, erinnliebhard.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/2013-wda-panel-proceedings.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The last type of jazz is [[Zimbabwean jazz|afro-jazz]].{{fact|date=August 2018}} The trailblazers of afro-jazz were [[Katherine Dunham]] and [[Alvin Ailey]].{{fact|date=August 2018}} Afro-jazz companies include [[Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater|Alvin Ailey Dance Theater]] and Dallas Black Dance Theatre.{{fact|date=August 2018}}

'''Jill Marsden''' (born 1964) is a scholar of the work of German philosopher [[Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche]]. Marsden, from [[Nottingham]], took her BA, MA and PhD from the [[University of Essex]]. Her [[doctoral thesis]] explored Nietzsche's Doctrine of Eternal Return. 

In 2002, Marsden's first book, ''After Nietzsche: Notes Towards a Philosophy of Ecstasy'', was published by [[Palgrave Macmillan]]. The text explores the imaginative possibilities for philosophy created by Nietzsche's sustained reflection on the phenomenon of "ecstasy". From ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]]'' (1872) to his experimental "physiology of art", Nietzsche examines the aesthetic, erotic and sacred dimensions of rapture, hinting at how an ecstatic philosophy is realized in his elusive doctrine of Eternal Return. Marsden's book pursues the implications of this legacy for contemporary continental thought via analyses of such voyages in ecstasy as [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Schopenhauer]], [[Daniel Paul Schreber|Schreber]] and [[Georges Bataille|Bataille]].

Marsden is a senior lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Bolton]]. She is at work on her second volume, set to explore 'the art of [[wiktionary:Brevity|brevity]]'. Outside of her work on Nietzsche, Marsden's research interests include [[aesthetics]], [[feminism]] and [[literature]], on which themes she has published articles in, among others, the ''Journal of the British Society for Phenomenology'' and ''Women's Philosophy Review''.

[[File:Pieter Bruegel de Oude - De val van Icarus.jpg|thumb|370px|''Landscape with the Fall of Icarus'', [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]]]
'''''Landscape with the Fall of Icarus''''' is a painting in [[oil paint|oil]] on [[canvas]] measuring {{convert|73.5|x|112|cm}} in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] in [[Brussels]]. It was long thought to be by the leading painter of [[Dutch and Flemish Renaissance painting]], [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]]. However, following technical examinations in 1996 of the painting hanging in the Brussels museum that attribution is regarded as very doubtful, and the painting, perhaps painted in the 1560s, is now usually seen as a good early copy by an unknown artist of Bruegel's lost original, perhaps from about 1558.  According to the museum: "It is doubtful the execution is by Breugel the Elder, but the composition can be said with certainty to be his",&lt;ref&gt;Says the Museum: "On doute que l'exécution soit de Pieter I Bruegel mais la conception lui est par contre attribuée avec certitude", {{cite web |url=http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/fabritiusweb/FullBBBody.csp?SearchMethod=Find_1&amp;Profile=Default&amp;OpacLanguage=fre&amp;RequestId=352686_1&amp;RecordNumber=0CSPCHD=000100030001318j79f5000821052062 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327082944/http://www.fine-arts-museum.be/fabritiusweb/FullBBBody.csp?SearchMethod=Find_1&amp;Profile=Default&amp;OpacLanguage=fre&amp;RequestId=352686_1&amp;RecordNumber=0CSPCHD=000100030001318j79f5000821052062 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 March 2012 |title=Description détaillée |accessdate=3 September 2011 |language=French |author=[[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title=Bruegel's "Fall of Icarus": Ovid or Solomon? |first1=Lyckle|last1= de Vries|journal= Simiolus: Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art|volume= 30|issue=1/2|year=2003|pages=4–18 |publisher=Stichting voor Nederlandse Kunsthistorische Publicaties  |doi=10.2307/3780948  |jstor=3780948}}&lt;/ref&gt; although recent technical research has re-opened the question.

Largely derived from [[Ovid]], the painting is described in [[W. H. Auden]]'s famous poem "[[Musée des Beaux Arts (poem)|Musée des Beaux-Arts]]", named after the museum in Brussels which holds the painting, and became the subject of a [[Landscape with the Fall of Icarus (poem)|poem of the same name]] by [[William Carlos Williams]], as well as "Lines on Bruegel's 'Icarus'" by [[Michael Hamburger]].&lt;ref&gt;Rico, 19 (gives text)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Fall of Icarus - Brueghel -Museum van Buuren.jpg|thumb|left|''Landscape with The Fall of Icarus'', ca. 1590–95, oil  on wood ({{convert|63|x|90|cm}}), Circle of P. Bruegel the Elder, [[Museum van Buuren]], Brussels, Belgium]]

In [[Greek mythology]], [[Icarus]] succeeded in flying, with wings made by his father [[Daedalus]], using feathers secured with [[bees wax]].  Ignoring his father's warnings, Icarus chose to fly too close to the sun, melting the wax, and fell into the sea and drowned. His legs can be seen in the water just below the ship. The sun, already half-set on the horizon, is a long way away; the flight did not reach anywhere near it. Daedalus does not appear in this version of the painting, though he does, still flying, in the van Buuren one (see below).

The ploughman, shepherd and angler are mentioned in Ovid's account of the legend; they are: "astonished and think to see gods approaching them through the aether",&lt;ref name=hag60/&gt; which is not entirely the impression given in the painting. The shepherd gazing into the air, away from the ship, may be explained by another version of the composition (see below); in the original work there was probably also a figure of Daedalus in the sky to the left, at which he stares.  There is also a Flemish [[proverb]] (of the sort imaged in other works by Bruegel): "And the farmer continued to plough..." (En de boer ... hij ploegde voort") pointing out the ignorance of people to fellow men's suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/philolog/2005/11/ekphrasis_ovid_in_pieter_breug.html |title=Ekphrasis or Not? Ovid (Met. 8.183-235 ) in Pieter Bruegel the Elder’s Landscape with the Fall of Icarus |first=Patrick |last=Hunt |authorlink=Patrick Hunt (archeologist) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710115527/http://traumwerk.stanford.edu/philolog/2005/11/ekphrasis_ovid_in_pieter_breug.html |archivedate=2009-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting may, as Auden's poem suggests, depict humankind's indifference to suffering by highlighting the ordinary events which continue to occur, despite the unobserved death of Icarus.

Though the [[world landscape]], a type of work with the title subject represented by small figures in the distance, was an established type in [[Early Netherlandish painting]], pioneered by [[Joachim Patiner]], to have a much larger unrelated "[[genre painting|genre]]" figure in the foreground is original and represents something of a blow against the emerging [[hierarchy of genres]].  Other landscapes by Bruegel, for example ''[[The Hunters in the Snow]]'' (1565) and others in that series of paintings showing the seasons, show genre figures in a raised foreground, but not so large relative to the size of the image, nor with a subject from a "higher" class of painting in the background.  

However, paintings from the same period by the Antwerp artist [[Pieter Aertsen]] had large kitchen or market genre scenes, with large figures in the foreground, and in the distant background a glimpse of a scene from the [[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]].  Giving more prominence to "low" subject-matter than "high" in the same work is a feature of some [[Northern Mannerist]] art, often called "Mannerist inversion".  The traditional moral of the Icarus story, warning against excessive ambition, is reinforced by (literally) fore-grounding humbler figures who appear content to fill useful agricultural roles in life.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, Rose-Marie and Rainer; ''What Great Paintings Say'', vol 1, 265, 2005, 2 vols, Taschen, {{ISBN|9783822847909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting is probably a version of a lost original by Bruegel. A date of c. 1558 has been suggested for the lost original, based on Bruegel's other works;&lt;ref name=hag60/&gt; the copy probably comes from the 1560s or soon after.  It is in oils whereas Bruegel's other paintings on canvas are in [[tempera]].&lt;ref name=VanStry1998&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=International Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|title=Radiocarbon Dating of Canvas Paintings: Two Case Studies |first1= Mark J. Y. |last1=Van Strydonck| first2=Liliane |last2=Masschelein-Kleiner|first3= Cees |last3=Alderliesten|first4= Arie F. M. |last4=de Jong|journal= Studies in Conservation |year=1998 |pages=209–214 |volume=43 |issue=4 |jstor=1506730 |doi=10.2307/1506730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was unknown until it was bought by the museum in 1912; subsequently another version on panel, generally considered inferior, turned up, which was acquired in 1953 by Daniel van Buuren for his private house, today a [[Museum van Buuren|museum in Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;de Vries:4&lt;/ref&gt;  In this, which excludes the far left and right sides of the composition, Icarus is in the water but Daedelus is still in the air, and the shepherd's gaze is directed at him, explaining one aspect of the composition of the other version.  The original would have been Bruegel's only known painting of a mythological subject. The perspective of the ship and figures is not entirely consistent, although this may enhance the power of the composition.  Bruegel also produced a design for an [[engraving]] with the ship and the two falling figures.&lt;ref name=hag60&gt;{{cite book |first1=Rose-Marie |last1=Hagen |first2=Rainer |last2= Hagen |title=Bruegel, The Complete Paintings |page=60 |year=2001 |publisher=Midpoint Press |isbn=3-8228-1531-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its acquisition by the Museum in 1912, its authenticity has been challenged by several specialists, mainly for two reasons: (i) the relatively weak quality of the painting compared to other Bruegels, although this question is complicated by later overpainting; (ii) it is an oil painting on canvas, an exception in the work of Peter Bruegel the Elder who made all his oil paintings on panel.

In 1963, [[Philippe Roberts-Jones]], curator at the museum, and the Bruegel specialist Georges Marlier, hypothesized that an original [[panel painting]] had been later moved onto canvas, as was once common.  

===Scientific tests===
In 1998, a mixed team of scientists from the Belgian [[Royal Institute for Cultural Heritage]] and the [[University of Utrecht]]&lt;ref name=VanStry1998/&gt; attempted to solve the authenticity problem by a [[radiocarbon dating]] of the canvas that was supposed to be the original support. As mentioned here above, the conclusion of this dating was that P. Bruegel the Elder cannot have painted on this canvas. Later, in 2006, Prof. J. Reisse (Université libre de Bruxelles) challenged this dating on technical grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first1=Ph.|last1=Roberts-Jones|first2=J.|last2=Reisse|first3=F.|last3=Roberts-Jones-Popelier|title=La chute d'Icare: mise au point et controverse|journal=Bull. Académie Royale de Belgique|volume=1-6|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample of blue paint taken from the right edge in 1973 was re-examined by performing analysis such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled to the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), which in connection with optical microscopy revealed the following structure and composition. From bottom to top:
# Canvas (from transposition);
# Oily lead white (adhesive);
# Thick oily layer with azurite (repaint);
# Chalk ground;
# Oily lead white with scarce particles of charcoal;
# Oily blue with azurite;
with layers 4 to 6 being original.

The presence of chalk ground under the original blue proves that this is a panel painting transposed on a canvas.
The original blue layer is lead white with azurite containing a few grains of ochre and charcoal. These structure and composition match perfectly those found on other certified panels of Peter Bruegel. Moreover, it is noticeable that the wood charcoal particles are very peculiar, being very long and acicular, exactly the same as those found only in ''The Census'' from the same Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|first1=Leopold|last1=Kockaert|title=Bruegel's ''Fall of Icarus'' at the Laboratory|conference=Symposium ''Brueghel enterprises'', Brussels 20–21 June 2002|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Joos de Momper Icarus.JPG|thumb|This related work by [[Joos de Momper]] includes the ploughman and angler, but Icarus is still in flight, with wax drops falling.]]

Recently, a study of the underdrawing using [[infrared reflectography]] has been published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectography is based on the fact that the infrared light penetrates all colors except black. As a result, the drawing, mostly black can be made visible. The interpretation of these reflectograms is of course more subjective, but in a global way, the drawing from the ''Fall of Icarus'' is not really different from other certified works from Peter Bruegel the Elder. This drawing is generally limited to a layout of the elements. Probably because the thin, weakly covering paint on white ground would hide imperfectly a detailed graphism. 

A re-interpretation of the reflectograms in agreement with the other analysis suggested the conclusion that the work in the Museum of Fine Arts in Brussels is a [[panel painting]] transferred to canvas. The paint layer and maybe also the underdrawing have been severely damaged by this intervention as well as by two more relinings, responsible for the heavy overpainting. In the paint sample remains a fragment with structure and composition matching perfectly the technique of the large panels attributed to Peter Bruegel the Elder. It is therefore unlikely that this version of the ''Fall of Icarus'' might be from the hand of a copyist, except perhaps from P. Bruegel the Younger. Conversely, the Van Buuren copy with a different technique cannot be attributed to either Peter Bruegel.

The painting is shown in [[Nicolas Roeg]]'s film ''[[The Man Who Fell to Earth]]'' (1976), where a character opens a book of paintings to an image of it. On the facing page a description points out that the scene remains calm, the event of the fall hardly noticed.

Composer [[Brian Ferneyhough]]'s 1988 chamber work ''La Chute d'Icare'' was inspired by the painting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;What this piece attempts to suggest is ... less a reflection on the heroic-tragic dimension of the underlying myth than a transcription of the strange sensation of “already having been” which is brilliantly evoked by Breughel in the view of a world serenely pursuing its own concerns, completely
oblivious to the almost invisible tiny pair of legs waving pathetically out of the water, the only record of the apocalyptic event being a pair of feathers floating disconsolately down in the wake of their erstwhile owner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ferneyhough|first1=Brian|title=''La Chute d'Icare'' (program note)|url=http://www.editionpeters.com/resources/0001/stock/pdf/la_chute_d_%27icare.pdf|publisher=Edition Peters|accessdate=2014-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The painting was also used as a backdrop in the music video for [[Blood Sweat &amp; Tears (song)|Blood Sweat &amp; Tears]], a 2016 single by South Korean group [[BTS (band)|BTS]].

[[File:Civic Opera House 060528.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Civic Opera House]]
'''Lyric Opera of Chicago''' is one of the leading [[opera]] companies in the United States. It was founded in [[Chicago]] in 1954, under the name 'Lyric Theatre of Chicago' by [[Carol Fox (Chicago opera)|Carol Fox]], [[Nicolà Rescigno]] and Lawrence Kelly, with a season that included [[Maria Callas]]'s American debut in ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. The company was re-organized by Fox in 1956 under its present name and, after her 1981 departure, it has continued to be of one of the major opera companies in the United States.  The Lyric is housed in the [[Civic Opera Building]], which the company now owns.

==Opera in Chicago 1850–1954==
The first opera to be performed in Chicago was Bellini's ''[[La sonnambula]]'', presented by a traveling opera company on 29 July 1850.&lt;ref&gt;Preston 1993, p. ??: "One measure of ''La sonnambula'' 's popularity is the fact that it was the first opera to be performed in Chicago."&lt;/ref&gt; Chicago's first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the [[Great Fire of Chicago]] in 1871. The second opera house, the [[Chicago Auditorium]], opened in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;"Chicago Opera" in ''The Encyclopedia Americana'' (1973), Volume 1: "Chicago's first opera house opened in 1865 but was destroyed in the Great Fire five years later. A new house, the Auditorium, opened in 1889"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929 the current [[Civic Opera House]] on 20 North Wacker Drive was opened, though the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] Company itself collapsed in the [[Great Depression]]. The old Auditorium continued to produce stage shows and musicals till it closed in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Zeitz, p. 93: "In 1929 it relinquished its role as Chicago's premier opera house to the new Civic Opera Building (see p. 95). But six years earlier,... ''Hellzapoppin'' was the last show to grace the stage before the Auditorium closed in 1941."&lt;/ref&gt;

Resident opera companies began in Chicago in 1910 with the [[Chicago Grand Opera Company]] being formed from the remains of the Manhattan Opera Company, which had been founded by Oscar Hammerstein I, and had been squeezed out by the more financially sound Metropolitan Opera. Chicago had this first company for four seasons, then, after no season in 1914/15, it was re-formed as the [[Chicago Opera Association]]. This lasted through 1921/22, when it became the [[Chicago Civic Opera]] from 1922 until 1932. After no season in 1932/33, the company was re-formed and again named the Chicago Grand Opera Company from 1933 to 1935. From 1936 to 1939, the company was called [[Chicago City Opera Company]], and finally from 1940 to 1946 opera was presented by the [[Chicago Opera Company]]. There were no seasons from 1947 until 1953, so opera was presented by other companies on tour. Lyric Opera was formed in 1954 and has continued uninterrupted except for 1967.

==Lyric Opera, 1954 to 1980==
Carol Fox, America's first female opera impresario at the age of 28, began her first season in 1954 by bringing [[Maria Callas]] for her American debut in the title role of ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'', the first of many electrifying Callas performances in Chicago. However, this first eight-opera season in 1954 was not the result of a long apprenticeship in opera production; Carol Fox, fluent in Italian and French, had studied opera singing for many years, culminating in two years of intensive work in Italy. However, when she realized that performance was not to be in her future, she decided that it lay in bringing the performances of the world's finest artists to her home town of Chicago. Her success can be measured in one statistic regarding the filling of the Lyric's Civic Opera House: in 1954, the season ran for three weeks; in 2007/08 the Lyric had an almost six-month season.

Fox also used her formidable persuasive powers on artists other than singers: she was able to bring [[Rudolph Nureyev]] to make his debut on an American opera stage at the Lyric; [[Vera Zorina]], [[Alicia Markova]], [[Erik Bruhn]] and [[Maria Tallchief]] also danced at the Lyric, and [[George Balanchine]] created choreography for the Lyric. The Italian composer [[Pino Donati]] was her artistic director. [[Bruno Bartoletti]] was principal conductor, but other conductors included [[Tullio Serafin]], [[Dimitri Mitropoulos]] and [[Artur Rodzinski]]. [[Christoph von Dohnányi]] and Sir [[Georg Solti]] chose the Lyric for their American operatic debuts. [[Franco Zeffirelli]] staged operas as did [[Harold Prince]].

Because of her illnesses and her refusal to lower her artistic standards despite the Lyric's dire financial state in 1980, her resignation was sought and given. Carol Fox died a few months later, survived by a daughter Victoria.

It was of the Lyric's founder that [[Saul Bellow]] wrote in 1979 "Miss Fox will be remembered, together with Jane Addams of Hull House and Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine, as one of Chicago's greatest women."&lt;ref&gt;Cassidy, Claudia, foreword by Saul Bellow, ''Lyric Opera of Chicago'', The Opera,1979, {{ISBN|0960353801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the many years at the Lyric, Carol Fox developed the confidence and authority to bring world-famous artists to the Lyric: [[Luciano Pavarotti]] (56 performances in 7 roles), [[Tito Gobbi]], [[Eleanor Steber]], [[Jussi Björling]], [[Birgit Nilsson]], [[Renata Tebaldi]], [[Giuseppe Di Stefano]], [[Giulietta Simionato]], [[Richard Tucker]], [[Boris Christoff]], [[Eileen Farrell]], [[Dorothy Kirsten]], [[Leonie Rysanek]], [[Leontyne Price]], [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]], [[Geraint Evans]], [[Mirella Freni]], [[Nicolai Ghiaurov]], [[Alfredo Kraus]], [[Renata Scotto]], [[Robert Merrill]], [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Christa Ludwig]], [[Jon Vickers]], [[Marilyn Horne]], [[Grace Bumbry]], [[Montserrat Caballé]], [[Tatiana Troyanos]], [[Sherrill Milnes]], [[Plácido Domingo]], [[Felicia Weathers]] and [[José Carreras]]. [[Anna Moffo]] also chose the Lyric for her American debut.

==Later administrations, 1981 to the present==
Carol Fox was succeeded at the Lyric by her longtime assistant manager, [[Ardis Krainik]] (1981–1996), after whom the opera house was named, and then by William Mason (1997–2011). [[Anthony Freud]] took over in October 2011.

Sir [[Andrew Davis (conductor)|Andrew Davis]] is Lyric's music director and principal conductor, a post he has occupied since in September 2000. He led three complete cycles of ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen]]'' in the 2004/05 season to mark the company's 50th anniversary. [[Danny Newman]] was the company's long-time press agent from 1954 until his retirement in the 2001/02 season; Newman is largely credited as the founder of subscription-based arts marketing, the standard economic model for not-for-profit arts organizations in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Weber, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9904EFDD153BF930A1575AC0A961958260 "Arts in America; The Unsung Hero of Nonprofit Theater Is Still Selling"], ''The New York Times'', 23 December 1997&lt;/ref&gt; [[Philip David Morehead]] was head of music staff until his retirement in 2015.

==Production history==
In addition to the [[List of famous operas|standard operatic repertoire]], Lyric also presents contemporary works. Recent productions have included [[John Harbison|Harbison's]] ''[[The Great Gatsby#Opera|The Great Gatsby]]'' (2000–2001), [[Kurt Weill|Weill's]] ''[[Street Scene (opera)|Street Scene]]'' (2001–2002), [[Carlisle Floyd|Floyd's]] ''[[Susannah]]'', [[Stephen Sondheim|Sondheim's]] ''[[Sweeney Todd (musical)|Sweeney Todd]]'' (2002–2003), and [[John Adams]]' ''[[Doctor Atomic]]'' directed by Peter Sellars.

Composer [[William Bolcom]] wrote his most recent opera for Lyric, ''[[A Wedding (opera)|A Wedding]]'', based on the 1978 film of the same name directed by [[Robert Altman]]. It premiered during Lyric's 50th-anniversary season. During the 2015/16 season, the company premiered its latest commission, ''[[Bel Canto (opera)|Bel Canto]]'' by Peruvian composer [[Jimmy López]] with a libretto by [[Nilo Cruz]] based on the novel by [[Ann Patchett]].

The Lyric Opera productions were broadcast and nationally syndicated by [[WFMT]] Radio Network, from 1971 until 2001. 
The broadcasts ceased then because of a loss of sponsorship &lt;ref&gt;Sponsors' Withdrawal Ends Lyric Opera Radio Show: John von Rhein, Chicago Tribune, September 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;.  The issue was resolved at the 11th hour for the October 21, 2006 premiere of [[Richard Strauss]]'s opera ''[[Salome (opera)|Salome]]'' starring [[Deborah Voigt]]. Syndicated broadcast of the Lyric Opera resumed in May 2007 on the [[WFMT]] network, which was included on [[XM Satellite Radio]] before it merged and became SiriusXM Radio.

:''For details, see [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]]''

The company's permanent home is the [[Civic Opera House (Chicago)|Civic Opera House]], a building which it rented from 1954 until after the 1993 renovations. It is a 1929 structure with an [[Art Deco]] interior. Its 3,563-seat capacity makes it the second-largest opera auditorium in [[North America]] after the [[Metropolitan Opera|Metropolitan Opera House]] in New York City. The interior was named ''The Ardis Krainik Theatre'' in 1996 in honor of Ardis Krainik, the former General Director, who was responsible for its renovation from 1993 onwards.

===Joffrey Ballet===

In 2017, Lyric Opera of Chicago as house manager of the theater announced that the [[Joffrey Ballet]] plans to move from its longtime performance venue at the [[Auditorium Theatre]] to the opera house in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/ct-ae-lyric-joffrey-jones-1001-story.html |title=How the Lyric and Joffrey's new partnership will change cultural Chicago |last=Jones |first=Chris |work=chicagotribune.com |access-date=2017-12-22 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement coincided with the Lyric’s presentation of a new production of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck|Gluck's]] ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' by choreographer [[John Neumeier]]; the production fused the musical and ballet elements of the opera and featured the Joffrey Ballet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/theater/reviews/ct-ent-lyric-joffrey-orphee-review-20170924-story.html|title=Review: Triumphant new 'Orphee' presages strong partnership of Lyric Opera, Joffrey Ballet|last=von Rhein|first=John|date=September 24, 2017|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center==
The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center (formerly Lyric Opera Center for American Artists, 1981–2006), established in 1974 by Carol Fox, is the professional artist-development program for Lyric Opera of Chicago.

The Ryan Opera Center is considered one of the most prestigious vocal programs in America,&lt;ref name="ketterson"&gt;Ketterson, Mark Thomas, [https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062610/http://www.usoperaweb.com/2003/autum/locaa.html "Lyric Opera Center of American Artists Trains the Opera Singers of the Future]", on usoperaweb.com, Autumn 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
and has produced notable singers, including:

{{div col end}}

Approximately a dozen young singers are selected from the near 400 who audition annually,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyricopera.org/about/ryanopera.aspx The Patrick G. and Shirley W. Ryan Opera Center website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016025244/http://www.lyricopera.org/about/ryanopera.aspx |date=2009-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are in residence for twelve months. Over the course of the year they receive advanced instruction in numerous aspects of operatic performance, including voice lessons and coachings, language and acting training, and master classes with some of opera’s most renowned artists. The singers gain valuable performing experience by participating in recitals and concerts at many Chicago-area venues. During Lyric Opera’s mainstage season, they perform and understudy roles at all levels. The singers work with the world’s greatest opera singers, conductors, and directors, thus advancing the young artists’ professionalism. In 2005, author [[William Murray (writer)|William Murray]] wrote a book about a year in the life of an entering class at the Ryan Opera Center.&lt;ref&gt;See Murray, William 2006, ''Fortissimo: Backstage at the Opera with Sacred Monsters and Young Singers''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Foldi]] was Director of the Ryan Opera Center from 1991 to 1995. He was succeeded by [[Richard Pearlman]], who was Director of the program from 1995 until his death in 2006. Renowned soprano [[Gianna Rolandi]], who had been the Ryan Opera Center's Director of Vocal Studies and principal instructor since 2002, was appointed Director of the program in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.operanews.com/Opera_News_Magazine/2006/5/News/Gianna_Rolandi_Named_as_New_Lyric_Opera_Center_for_American_Artists_Director.html "Gianna Rolandi Named as New Lyric Opera Center for American Artists Director"], ''[[Opera News]]''.

'''Mauryan polish''' describes one of the essential characteristics of the sculptures of [[Maurya Empire]] in [[India]], in the 3rd century BCE, a remarkable polish of the statuary which gives a shiny aspect to the stone material, generally of [[sandstone]] or [[granite]].&lt;ref name = "Gupta 88"&gt;The roots of Indian Art, Gupta, p .88&lt;/ref&gt; Mauryan polish is found especially in the [[Ashoka Pillars]] as well as in some constructions like the [[Barabar Caves]]. It seems that the art of polishing in India was lost after the disappearance of the Maurya Empire in 180 BCE. According to the archaeologist [[John Marshall (archaeologist)|John Marshall]]: the "extraordinary precision and accuracy which characterizes all Mauryan works, and which has never, we venture to say, been surpassed even by the finest workmanship on Athenian buildings".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8XXGhAL1WKcC&amp;pg=PA165 The Early History of India by Vincent A Smith]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Debate on Achaemenid vs indigenous origins ==
[[Achaemenid art|Achaemenid sculptural art]] was often characterized by a great level of polishing of the stone (usually [[sandstone]], a very hard material), and it is thought that this polishing influenced the Maurya polishing, as is visible in the architecture of the columns of [[Pataliputra]].&lt;ref&gt;Sailendra Nath Sen's Ancient Indian History and Civilization [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wk4_ICH_g1EC&amp;pg=PA118 p.118]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Influence In Ancient India, by Jairazbhoy, Publication date 1963 [https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.126827 p.45]&lt;/ref&gt; Sandstone is very hard to work, so it is believed that polishing was obtained by the use of [[Emery (rock)|emery]] grains ([[Mohs scale|Mohs hardness index]] 8) from [[Naxos]] and [[Armenia]].&lt;ref name = "RS"&gt;"The extremely hard emery of Armenia, which was under the Achaemenid hegemony, seems to be the closest natural source for polishing the Persepolis, Pasargadae, and Susā royal palace stones" Hunt, 2008 in "Tectonic Evolution, Collision, and Seismicity of Southwest Asia, Rasul Sorkhabi [https://books.google.com/books?id=IQlQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA33 p.33]&lt;/ref&gt; Stones and polishing grains have been found in the ruins of Persepolis.&lt;ref name = "RS"/&gt; These polishing techniques were also used by the Greeks, who used the natural [[Naxos]] emery grains.&lt;ref&gt;"For efficient polishing, Greeks used emery (Mohs 8) from the rich deposits of the Cycladic island of Naxos." in A Companion to Greek Art, published by Tyler Jo Smith, Dimitris Plantzos [https://books.google.com/books?id=7q1LDrb9btkC&amp;pg=PT242 p.242]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that the stone-making techniques employed by the Mauryas may have derived from the techniques of [[Achaemenid]] statuary, stone-working and polishing techniques having spread to India after the destruction of the empire by [[Alexander the Great]] in 330 BCE and the displacement of Persian and Perso-Greek artists and technicians.&lt;ref name = "Mag"&gt;Maharashtra, Marg Publications, 1985, {{p.|209}} [https://www.marg-art.org/images/virtuemart/category/37_01_look_inside.pdf Pdf {{p.|2}}] "The surface of the inside walls are polished to a mirror-like finish, an exclusive characteristics of Mauryan architecture and sculpture, first derived through the media of Achamenid art after the disintegration of the Persian Empire in AD 330 and the dispersal of skilled Persian and Perso-Greek artisans "&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;According to Gupta, the polishing of rocks could have a local origin. He invokes the existence of polishing technologies of the [[neolithic]], visible in various stone tools such as axes. There is, however, no trace of evolution from these neolitical tools to polished stone architecture, and the Barabar caves are essentially a sudden technological break with no local history, suggesting the import of these techniques from another culture. Nor are there any known examples of stone architecture in India before the Maurya period.&lt;ref name="Gupta p.194"&gt;Gupta, The roots of Indian Art, p.194-&lt;/ref&gt; According to Gupta, the [[Son Bhandar Caves]] could be such an intermediate stage, relatively unique, and subject to questioning its chronology, since it is generally dated to the 2nd-4th centuries CE.&lt;ref name="Gupta p.194" /&gt; Polished crystal bowl with fish shaped lid knob from [[Piprahwa|Piprahwa stupa]]  (3rd century BC) and other polished gemstones, beads, reliquary seem to indicate that indian lapidary was well established during mauryan times. The polish was achieved by application of agate burnisher which was later applied on pillars and sandstone objects&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.my/books?id=0kd9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT55&amp;dq=Piprahwa+lapidary&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjri7Gm1uPcAhXaV30KHfBpAb4Q6AEIOjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=Piprahwa%20lapidary&amp;f=false|title=Indian Architecture (Buddhist and Hindu Period)|last=Brown|first=Percy|date=2013-04-16|publisher=Read Books Ltd|isbn=9781447498575|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Devahuti|first=D.|date=1971|title=MAURYAN ART AND THE "EPISODE" THEORY|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/41688719|journal=Annals of the Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute|volume=52|issue=1/4|pages=161–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polished Barabar Caves==
{{main|Barabar Caves}}
{{double image | right | Gopika cave Anantavarman inscription.jpg | 225 | Sudama cave mirror-polished walls.jpg | 185 |Polishing "mirror-like" granite walls.&lt;ref name = "NL"/&gt; Left: wall of the corridor entrance of the Gopika cave (mirror effect accentuated by the flat angle of the photograph). Right: interior of the Sudama cave with reflection of a monk. These quasi-perfect walls were dug into the rock and polished before 261 BC, date of the rather clumsy inscriptions of [[Ashoka]].}} 
The [[Barabar caves]] are the first known and dated example of Mauryan polish, since they were dedicated by [[Ashoka]] in several inscriptions, in the year 12 and the year 19 of his reign. The caves were carved out of [[granite]], an extremely hard rock, then finished with a very nice [[polishing]] of the inner surface, giving a mirror effect of a great flatness, as well as an [[echo]] effect. {{Sfn | Michell | 1989}} &lt;ref name = "NL"&gt;Ashoka in Ancient India by Nayanjot Lahiri [https://books.google.com/books?id=bJ_XCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA231 {{p.|231}}]&lt;/ref&gt; This large-scale polish directly evokes polishing on smaller surfaces of the Maurya statuary, particularly visible on the pillars and capitals of the [[Pillars of Ashoka]].


This know-how seems to have disappeared again after the Maurya period, none of the subsequent caves such as the [[Ajanta Caves]] having this characteristic of polished surfaces &lt;ref name = "Mag"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Indian History [https://books.google.com/books?id=MazdaWXQFuQC&amp;pg=SL1-PA268 {{p.|268}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Barabar Caves]], some caves where dedicated through inscription by [[Ashoka]] (the caves of the Barabar group), as well as by his grandson and successor [[Dasaratha Maurya]] (the caves of the Nagarjuni group). Both group of caves have perfectly polished walls, which suggest that polishing techniques were not exclusive to Ashoka, and continued as least for some time after his reign.

After the Barabar Caves, the polishing of cave walls was abandonned, never to be revived, despite the huge efforts at building Buddhist and Jain caves until the 6th century CE. Such grandiose caves as [[Karla Caves]] (1st century CE) or the [[Ajanta Caves]] (5th century CE) do not have any polishing either. This may be due to the fact that Mauryan caves where dedicated and sponsored by the Mauryan Imperial government, allowing for huge ressources and efforts to be spent, whereas later caves where essentially the result of donations by individuals, who could not afford as high a level of spending.&lt;ref&gt;Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist architecture, p.99&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pillars of Ashoka==
[[File: Ashoka pillar, Lauriya-Araraj.jpg | thumb|A highly polished pillar of Ashoka, Lauriya-Araraj.]]
The [[pillars of Ashoka]], made of sandstone, generally also exhibit a high level of Mauryan polish. Here again the mirror-like polish has generally been considered as an import from the Near-East, but some authors now consider the [[Son Bhandar Caves]] might constitute a precedent and an evolutionary step to this type of polish, although these caves are generally dated to a much later period (2-4th century CE).&lt;ref&gt;Buddhist Architecture, Le Huu Phuoc, Grafikol, 2009, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

===The pillars===
[[File:Ashoka_Lauriya_Areraj_inscription.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Polished surface of a pillar.]]
All known Mauryan pillars have the characteristic mirror-like polish, although most were left unpolished over the surface of the bottom part meant to be buried in the ground.&lt;ref&gt;Le Huu Phuoc, Buddhist Architecture, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;

Inscriptions were made over the polished finish, with the ungainly result that the polished stone is chipped around the letters. Normally, the text should be inscribed first, and only then should the stone be polished if a good result is to be obtained. This tends to suggest that the inscriptions were made as an afterthought, after the pillar has been properly completed.

===The capitals===
Some of the capitals of the pillars of Ashoka exhibit mirror-like polish (such as the [[Sarnath]] and the [[Sanchi]] capitals), while other don't and only have a smooth surface (the [[Sankissa]] capital or the [[Rampurva]] bull elephant). This, together with epigraphical considerations, has even led some authors to question if these non-polished capital might be of a time prior to Ashoka.&lt;ref&gt;John Irwin, "The true chronology of Ashokan pillars", [https://www.scribd.com/document/136703111/Chronology-of-Asokan-Pillars p.147]&lt;/ref&gt; 

These non-polished pillars are also those that displays the highest level of [[Hellenistic influence on Indian art|Hellenistic influence]]: in the case of the [[Rampurva]] bull or the [[Sankassa]] elephant, the abacus is composed of [[honeysuckles]] alternated with stylized [[palmette]]s and small [[rosette (design)|rosettes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA40|title=Buddhist Architecture|first=Huu Phuoc|last=Le|date=29 October 2017|publisher=Grafikol|accessdate=29 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar kind of design can be seen in the frieze of the lost capital of the [[Allahabad pillar]]. These designs likely originated in Greek and Near-Eastern arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9jb364g4BvoC&amp;pg=PA44|title=Buddhist Architecture|first=Huu Phuoc|last=Le|date=29 October 2017|publisher=Grafikol|accessdate=29 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mauryan statuary==
[[File:Lohanipur torso.jpg|thumb|The [[Lohanipur torso]], possibly a [[Jain]] [[Tirthankara]], 3rd century BCE, discovered in [[Lohanipur]], now in [[Patna Museum]].]]
There are many examples of polished stone statuettes and artifacts from the Mauryan period. One of the them, the [[Masarh lion]], discovered near Patna, is special in that its style is nearly completely [[Achaemenid]], which suggests a high level of artistic influence from [[Western Asia]] at the time the statuette was made.

The Masarh lion, discovered near [[Pataliputra]] and dated to the 3rd century BCE, is carved in [[sandstone]] of the [[Chunar stone|Chunar type]], like the [[Ashoka Pillars]], and its finish is polished.&lt;ref name = "Gupta 88"/&gt; The sculptural style is also indisputably [[Achaemenid]] &lt;ref name ="Gupta 88"/&gt; This is particularly visible with the well-ordered tubular representation of whiskers ([[vibrissa]]s), and the geometrical representation of inflated veins flush within the whole face.&lt;ref name = "Gupta 88"/&gt; The mane on the other hand, with the tufts of hair represented in ripples, is rather naturalistic.&lt;ref name = "Gupta 88"/&gt; According to [[Swaraj Prakash Gupta|SP Gupta]], these stylistic characteristics can be described as non-Indian.&lt;ref name = "Gupta 88"/&gt; 
Very similar examples of sculptures are known in [[Greece]] and in [[Persepolis]].&lt;ref name = "Gupta 88"/&gt; It is possible that this sculpture was made by an Achaemenid or Greek sculptor in India and either remained without effect, or was the Indian imitation of a Greek or Achaemenid model, somewhere between the 5th and the 1st century BCE, although it is generally dated from the time of the [[Maurya Empire]], around the 3rd century BCE.&lt;ref name = "Gupta 88"/&gt;

According to [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]], the lion sculpture of Marsarh is "quite Persian", although the treatment of the mane is rather of Greek naturalistic style and breaks with the rigid and codified style of the [[Achaemenid Empire]].&lt;ref name = "JB98"&gt;The Origins of Indian Stone Architecture, 1998, [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]] [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24049089?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents p.18].&lt;/ref&gt; For him, the lions of the [[Lion Capital of Ashoka]] at [[Sarnath]] represent the next logical and artistic step, and would be the realization of Hellenistic Greek artists to soften and give more naturality to Persian style.&lt;ref name = "JB98"/&gt;

There are also a few examples of polished statuary, all dated to the Mauryan period, such as the polished sculpture of a head from [[Sarnath]].

The [[Diamond throne]] of [[Bodhgaya]] is another example. It was established by Ashoka at [[Bodh Gaya]] and also exhibits the characteristic Mauryan polish.&lt;ref&gt;The Origins of Indian Stone Architecture, 1998, John Boardman [https://www.jstor.org/stable/24049089?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents pp. 13-22].&lt;/ref&gt;

Polished ringstones are variously said to be Mauryan or Sunga, dating ranging for the 3rd c.BCE to the 1st c.BCE.&lt;ref name="Gupta p.53"&gt;Gupta, The Roots of Indian Art, p.53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Mauryan near abandonment of polishing techniques==
[[File: Didarganj Yakshi statue in the Bihar Museum.jpg | thumb | right |upright| The [[Didarganj Yakshi]], whose polish evokes the sculptural technique of the Maurya period, but whose iconographic style seems to be related to the 2nd-3rd centuries CE.]]
After the Mauryan period, the general sculptural trend is towards the complete abandon of polishing techniques. This may be due to the high cost involved with polishing. The end of the Mauryan period marked the end of imperial patronage of the arts, which thereafter tended to be financed by the people or the wealthy merchant class thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Le Huu Phuoc, p.45&lt;/ref&gt; There are however a few important cases of polishing that seem to subsist.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; 

The Parkam [[Yaksha]] "[[Manibhadra]]" is made of polished grey sandstone, in the same material as the [[Pillars of Ashoka]]. This statue is generally dated to the 3rd-1st centuries BCE, and may be immediately post-Mauryan.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt; It may be a transitional from the Mauryan period to next period including the reliefs of [[Bharhut]], presenting some continuity in the finishing technique, but a real fracture in terms of sculptural style.&lt;ref name=AS/&gt;

The [[Didarganj Yakshi]], although claimed by some as an example of [[Mauryan art]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2006-09-28/india/27808377_1_artefacts-mauryan-fortress|title=A fortress chockfull of chinks|last=Chaudhary|first=Pranava K|date=28 September 2006|work=[[Indiatimes]]|accessdate=17 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is generally dated to the 2nd century CE, based on the analysis of shape and ornamentation.&lt;ref&gt;"A History of Ancient and Early Medieval India: From the Stone Age to the 12th Century" by Upinder Singh, Pearson Education India, 2008 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=Pq2iCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA364]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;""Ayodhya, Archaeology After Demolition: A Critique of the "new" and "fresh" Discoveries", by Dhaneshwar Mandal, Orient Blackswan, 2003, p.46 [https://books.google.fr/books?id=FvTBfbfxAukC&amp;pg=PA69]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A Companion to Asian Art and Architecture" by Deborah S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7543">A '''metanarrative''' (also '''meta-narrative''' and '''grand narrative'''; {{lang-fr|métarécit}}) in [[critical theory]] and particularly in [[postmodernism]] is a narrative ''about'' narratives of historical meaning, experience, or knowledge, which offers a society [[legitimation]] through the anticipated completion of a (as yet unrealized) master idea.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentzi eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) pp. 102–3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean-François Lyotard, ''The Postmodern Explained to Children'' (1992) p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
"[[Meta]]" is Greek for "beyond"; "narrative" is a [[Narrative|story]] that is characterized by its telling (it is communicated somehow).&lt;ref&gt;The Meta-Narrative. [https://youtube.com/watch?v=UlXBFF1Pu9E "Lesson 1: What is a Meta-Narrative?"]. ''[[YouTube]]''. October 11, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although first used earlier in the 20th century, the term was brought into prominence by [[Jean-François Lyotard]] in 1979, with his claim that the postmodern was characterised precisely by a mistrust of the grand narratives ([[Progressivism|Progress]], [[The Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] [[emancipation]], [[Marxism]]) that had formed an essential part of [[modernity]].&lt;ref&gt;Childers pp. 166–7&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-structuralist skepticism==
In ''[[The Postmodern Condition|The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]]'' (1979), Lyotard highlights the increasing skepticism of the ''[[postmodern condition]]'' toward the [[Universality (philosophy)|totalizing nature]] of metanarratives and their reliance on some form of "transcendent and universal truth":&lt;ref&gt;Lyotard, Jean-François. [http://www.idehist.uu.se/distans/ilmh/pm/lyotard-introd.htm Introduction:The Postmodern Condition: A Report on Knowledge]," 1979: xxiv–xxv. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610183414/http://www.idehist.uu.se/distans/ilmh/pm/lyotard-introd.htm |date=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity toward metanarratives. ... The narrative function is losing its functors, its great hero, its great dangers, its great voyages, its great goal. It is being dispersed in clouds of narrative language ... Where, after the metanarratives, can legitimacy reside?}}

Lyotard and other [[post-structuralism|poststructuralist]] thinkers (like [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]])&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2007) p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; view this as a broadly positive development for a number of reasons. First, attempts to construct grand theories tend to unduly dismiss the naturally existing chaos and disorder of the universe, the power of the individual event.&lt;ref&gt;C. Nouvet et al eds., ''Minima Moralia'' (2007) pp. xii–iv&lt;/ref&gt;

===Replacing grand, universal narratives with small, local narratives===
Lyotard proposed that metanarratives should give way to ''petits récits'', or more modest and "localized" narratives, which can 'throw off' the grand narrative by bringing into focus the singular event.&lt;ref&gt;Nouvet, p. xvi&lt;/ref&gt; Borrowing from the works of [[Wittgenstein]] and his theory of the "models of discourse",&lt;ref&gt;Hans Bertens, ''The Idea of the Postmodern: A History'', Routledge, 1995, p124. {{ISBN|0-415-06011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lyotard constructs his vision of a [[progressive politics]], grounded in the cohabitation of a whole range of diverse and always locally legitimated [[language-game]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Francois Lyotard, ''The Differend'' (1988) p. 151-161&lt;/ref&gt;

Postmodernists attempt to replace metanarratives by focusing on specific local contexts as well as on the diversity of human experience. They argue for the existence of a "multiplicity of theoretical standpoints"&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Peters, ''Poststructuralism, Marxism, and Neoliberalism: Between Theory and Politics'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2001, p7. {{ISBN|0-7425-0987-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than for grand, all-encompassing theories.

==Narratology and communication==
According to John Stephens and Robyn McCallum, a metanarrative "is a global or totalizing cultural narrative [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] which orders and explains [[knowledge]] and [[experience]]"&lt;ref&gt;Stephens, John and Robyn McCallum. (1998). ''Retelling Stories, Framing Culture: Traditional Story and Metanarratives in Children's Literature''. {{ISBN|0-8153-1298-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; – a story ''about'' a story, encompassing and explaining other "little stories" within [[conceptual model]]s that assemble the "little stories" into a whole. Postmodern narratives will often deliberately disturb the formulaic expectations such cultural codes provide,&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Bertens/D. Fokkema, ''International Postmodernism'' (1997) p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; pointing thereby to a possible revision of the social code.&lt;ref&gt;E. D. Ermath, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[communication]] and [[strategic communication]], a master narrative (or metanarrative) is a "transhistorical narrative that is deeply embedded in a particular culture".&lt;ref name=halverson&gt;Halverson, Jeffry R., H.L. Goodall Jr. and Steven R. Corman. ''Master Narratives of Islamist Extremism''. New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2011. p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; A master narrative is therefore a particular type of narrative, which is defined as a "coherent ''system'' of interrelated and sequentially organized ''stories'' that share a common rhetorical desire to resolve a conflict by establishing audience expectations according to the known trajectories of its literary and rhetorical form".&lt;ref name=halverson/&gt;

The [[Consortium for Strategic Communication]] also maintains a website on master narratives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comops.org/index.php |title=CSC Center for Strategic Communication &amp;#124; |publisher=Comops.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Lyotard==
It is unclear whether Lyotard is ''describing'' a [[globalism|global condition]] of [[skepticism]] towards metanarratives in postmodernity, or ''prescribing'' such skepticism. His critics point out the awkward fact that meta-narratives clearly continue to play a major role in the current postmodern world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sociology.org.uk/ws1k5.htm Metanarratives]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Critics have also argued that, in so far as one of Lyotard's targets was Science, he was mistaken in thinking science relies on a grand narrative for social and epistemic validation, rather than upon the accumulation of many lesser narrative successes.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Bertens/D. Fokkema, ''International Postmodernism'' (1997) p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Moorish Castle''' is the name given to a [[medieval fortification]] in [[Gibraltar]] comprising various buildings, gates, and fortified walls, with the dominant features being the Tower of Homage and the Gate House. Part of the castle itself also housed [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|the prison]] of Gibraltar until it was relocated in 2010.&lt;ref name="Chronice 2010" /&gt; The Tower of Homage is clearly visible to all visitors to Gibraltar; not only because of its striking construction, but also because of its dominant and strategic position. Although sometimes compared to the nearby ''[[Alcázar|alcazars]]'' in [[Spain]], the Moorish Castle in Gibraltar was constructed by the [[Marinid dynasty]], making it unique in the [[Iberian Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date=May 1998 | url=http://www.maltwood.uvic.ca/cam/publications/CAM_bulletins/004_heritage_of_gibralter.html | title=The Heritage of Gibralter: A Reply | work=CAM Bulletins | publisher=Commonwealth Association of Museums | accessdate=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:View of Moorish Castle from Grand Battery.jpg|thumb|left|View of the Moorish Castle's northern defences as seen from the [[Grand Battery]] in 1879]]

Gibraltar has always been of special significance to the numerous peoples and civilizations that have visited or occupied it over the ages, from the [[Neanderthal]] period, through the Classical and on to [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]], [[Spain|Spanish]], and the current [[United Kingdom|British]] rule.

The Moorish occupation is by far the longest in Gibraltar's recorded history, having lasted from 711 to 1309 and then again from 1350 to 1462, a total of 710 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.guide-to-castles-of-europe.com/moorish-castle.html | title=Moorish Castle | publisher=Guide to the Castles of Europe | accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical importance of Gibraltar to both [[Muslim]]s and [[Christian]]s lies in the fact that the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania|Moorish invasion]] and occupation of parts of western [[Europe]] started from [[Gibraltar]] in 711 and, through to its final recapture by Spaniards in 1462, Moorish rule was gradually undermined until, with the fall of [[Granada]] in 1492, Moorish occupation of parts of western Europe came to an end after 781 years.

The Moorish conquest of [[Spain]] was led by [[Tarik ibn Ziyad]] and [[Musa ibn Nusayr]], who may have landed in Europe at or near Gibraltar. Gibraltar thus became the stepping-stone to the Moorish conquests of most of Spain and part of France. This spectacular feat of arms took a mere twenty-one years, no mean task considering the distances and terrain involved, and the fact that mechanical transport on land was not then in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gibraltar.gov.gi | title=Information on the Moorish Castle Complex | publisher=Government of Gibraltar | accessdate=2007-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategic importance of Gibraltar rose in the last years of the Moorish rule, when, after the successful Spanish reconquest of the entire Guadalquivir valley, Gibraltar became one of the key elements in communication between the [[Kingdom of Granada]] and Moorish domains in northwestern Africa.

Construction of the Moorish Castle commenced in the 8th century AD (possibly AD 711);{{dubious|date=November 2012}} the date of its completion is not recorded. Its walls enclosed a considerable area, reaching down from the upper part of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] to the sea. The most conspicuous remaining parts of the Castle are the upper tower, or Tower of Homage, together with various terraces and battlements below it, and the massive Gate House, with its cupola roof.&lt;ref name="gib_gi"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.gib.gi/heritage/castle.html#galley | title=Gibraltar Heritage Trust History of The Moorish Castle | accessdate=2007-02-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206031404/http://www.gib.gi/heritage/castle.html#galley | archivedate=2007-02-06 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Tower of Homage==
The Tower of Homage is the highest tower of the period of Islamic rule in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], and the [[Qasbah]] of the Castle is the largest in the area. The Castle itself played a prominent part in the Muslim invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, with Muslim forces overrunning a large portion of it in two years - an invasion which led to Islamic domination of parts of western Europe for more than seven centuries. It is therefore of historic significance not only for [[Gibraltar]] and [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], but also for all of western [[Europe]].

The present Tower of Homage, and most of what is visible today of the Castle, was rebuilt during the second Moorish period of occupation in the early 14th century, after its near destruction during a reconquest of Gibraltar by the Moors following a re-occupation by Spanish forces from 1309 to 1333.&lt;ref name="gib_gi" /&gt;

==Present day==
Today the Moorish Castle is one of the major tourist attractions of Gibraltar, and it is shown on the reverse of the 1995 design (still in circulation) of the [[Gibraltar Pound|Gibraltar five-pound banknote]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.currencymuseum.net/images/gibraltar25-1995r.JPG | title=World Paper Money - Image of the reverse of a 1995 £5 Gibraltar banknote | format=JPEG | work=Will's Online World Paper Money Gallery | accessdate=2012-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Moorish Castle" (or "''El Castillo''" in Spanish) is also used locally when referring to the residential area surrounding the Castle, location of the ''Moorish Castle Estate''.

Part of the castle itself housed [[Her Majesty's Prison Service|the prison]] of Gibraltar until the prison was relocated in 2010.&lt;ref name="Chronice 2010"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=19885 | title=GATES CLOSE, ‘WINDY’ PRISON OPENS FOR BUSINESS | accessdate=2010-09-01 | last=Mascarenhas | first=Alice | date=2010-09-01 | work=The Gibraltar Chronicle | publisher=The Gibraltar Chronicle | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5sQXDDEHx?url=http://www.chronicle.gi/headlines_details.php?id=19885 | archivedate=2010-09-01 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''My Immortal''''' is a ''[[Harry Potter]]'' [[fan fiction]] serially published on [[FanFiction.Net]] between 2006 and 2007. Known for its incomprehensible narrative and constant digressions, the story centers on a 17-year-old female vampire, a non-canonical character, and her relationships with the characters of the ''Harry Potter'' series, most notably her romantic relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]]. Ultimately, she is prompted by visions to travel back in time to try to defeat the main [[antagonist]] of the series, [[Lord Voldemort]].

Since the beginning of the work's publication, it has garnered infamy for bad writing, inconsistency, and disregard for the ''Harry Potter'' source material. Often regarded as among the worst fan fiction written, ''My Immortal'' is felt to be a detriment to those attempting to bring legitimacy to fan fiction. Despite this, the series has also inspired multiple derivative works, including a [[YouTube]] web series, and is viewed with nostalgia for adolescent fan life.

The author's identity has never been confirmed and has been deemed by many as "unsolvable". The author published the story under the username "XXXbloodyrists666XXX" and self-identified as Tara Gilesbie. In September 2017, someone claiming to be the author updated a [[FictionPress]] account stating that she had created an active [[Tumblr]] account under her real name; an effort to locate this Tumblr account resulted in the account of [[Young adult fiction|young adult]] novelist Rose Christo. She has since stated that she was one of two co-authors of ''My Immortal'', and had provided evidence of her authorship to [[Macmillan Publishers]], but controversy that same month over factual errors in her then-forthcoming memoirs has led to doubt as to her authorship.

The story has been speculated to be a hoax designed to either [[Internet troll|troll]] readers or to [[Satire|satirize]] fan fiction, but the work and the alleged online presence of the author has also been described as too elaborate and too time-consuming to fake effectively. In September 2017, Christo stated that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.

==Background and publication==
The work was published to [[FanFiction.Net]] between early 2006 and 2007, ultimately totaling 44 chapters and nearly 22,700 words.&lt;ref name="Vulture"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|title=The Bizarre, Unsolved Mystery of ‘My Immortal,’ the World’s Worst Fanfiction Story|last=Riesman|first=Abraham|date=March 12, 2015|website=|publisher=[[Vulture.com]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125172838/http://www.vulture.com/2015/03/bizarre-unsolved-mystery-of-my-immortal.html|archivedate=November 25, 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The forty-fourth chapter was accompanied by an author's note explaining that the author was leaving "{{sic|dubya}}", commonly believed to be [[Dubai]], and the chapter would be the last until the author's return.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVerge"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|title=The Worst Thing Ever Written|last=Robertson|first=Adi|date=December 10, 2013|website=|publisher=[[The Verge]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151202084919/http://www.theverge.com/2013/12/10/5166462/the-worst-thing-ever-written-a-history-of-trollfic|archivedate=December 2, 2015|deadurl=no|accessdate=November 28, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no further chapters were published. It was removed by site administrators in 2008, a few months after its last chapter was published. However, it survives in [[Cut, copy, and paste|copied-and-pasted]] versions across the Internet.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; The work apparently takes its name from the song "[[My Immortal]]" by [[Evanescence]].&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/worst-harry-potter-fanfic-my-immortal-web-series/|title=The worst "Harry Potter" fanfic ever is now a hilarious webseries|last=Baker-Whitelaw|first=Gavia|date=July 29, 2013|website=|publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]''|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160612122150/http://www.dailydot.com/fandom/worst-harry-potter-fanfic-my-immortal-web-series/|archivedate=June 12, 2016|deadurl=no|access-date=June 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Style and genre==
''My Immortal'' is split into 44 brief chapters. Author's notes, indicated by "AN", precede and are dispersed throughout the narrative prose. These notes are written in a largely [[phonetic spelling]] and characterized the author as "standoffish". As the work progressed, these author's notes increasingly became "defensive, impenetrable, and prone to mentioning [[suicide attempt]]s" and defended the work's poor spelling and deviation from canon characterization from negative reviewers.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

[[Abraham Riesman]] of [[Vulture.com]] described the prose as having "awkward rhythm, strange digressions, and stultifyingly [[purple prose]]" and noted that the work is "agonizing" to a regular fan fiction reader because of "all the hated [[Trope (literature)|tropes]]" it employs in the opening passage alone.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; [[Adi Robertson]] of ''[[The Verge]]'' observed that the quality of the prose declined after the twelfth chapter, when the work's editor had a falling out with the author and became temporarily uninvolved with the work; even after the editor and author reconciled, Robertson felt that the prose "never recovered".&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt; [[Gavia Baker-Whitelaw]] of ''[[The Daily Dot]]'' noted the work "featured all the hallmarks of terrible fanfic: hundreds of grammar and spelling mistakes, a nonsensical storyline, and a [[Mary Sue]] protagonist who was clearly a glorified version of the author" and pointed out the numerous descriptions of the protagonist's [[Hot Topic]] outfits.&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

The work is characterized by misspellings permeating both the work itself and the author's notes, to the point that the names of the protagonist and canonical ''Harry Potter'' characters are frequently and variously misspelled.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

The work has also been noted to fail to adhere to ''Harry Potter'' canon. It features "an incredibly OOC&amp;nbsp;[out-of-character] ''Harry Potter''&amp;nbsp;universe"&lt;ref name="TheMarySue"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/my-immortal-webseries/|title=Infamously Bad ''Harry Potter'' Fanfic ''My Immortal'' Gets Web Series|last=Jaffe|first=Brooke|date=July 29, 2013|website=|publisher=[[The Mary Sue]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160713124934/http://www.themarysue.com/my-immortal-webseries/|archivedate=July 13, 2016|deadurl=no|access-date=June 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where "at no point do any of the ''Harry Potter'' characters act even slightly like themselves".&lt;ref name="io9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-most-infamously-awful-fanfic-ever-my-immortal-h-961749327|title=The most infamously awful fanfic ever, "My Immortal," has a web series|last=Bricken|first=Rob|date=July 30, 2013|website=|publisher=[[io9]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160616021429/http://io9.gizmodo.com/the-most-infamously-awful-fanfic-ever-my-immortal-h-961749327|archivedate=June 16, 2016|deadurl=no|access-date=June 12, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; References to "decidedly un-Harry Potterish bands" such as [[My Chemical Romance]] have also been noted.&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

Chapters 39 and 40, according to the author's notes, were written by a hacker, and the writing in both chapters was a "much more controlled prose that read like a lampoon of the previous 38".&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

==Authorship==
===2006–2016: Speculation on authorship and genre===
''My Immortal'' was published under the username "XXXbloodyrists666XXX", and the author also used the name "Tara Gilesbie". Author's notes in the story identified a friend nicknamed Raven, operating under the username "bloodytearz666", as the work's editor and [[beta reader]]. Later author's notes claimed that someone hacked into Gilesbie's account and wrote chapters 39 and 40.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

The true identity of the author became subject to wide speculation, and since the publication of the final chapter, various individuals have claimed to have written the work in jest or as a hoax.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; Due to its "systematically terrible" quality, the work is often believed to be a [[satire]] or [[parody]] of fan fiction.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt; 

At the same time, the "exceedingly complicated" details of the work, including a series of related online accounts outside of FanFiction.net and the effort of writing a work of such length, led to a "consensus" among users of [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]]—a website notorious for online trolling and dedicated to cataloging "internet culture" — that it would be too difficult to fake and that Gilesbie was writing sincerely, a sentiment apparently shared by other online communities who mocked the author.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; [[Brad Kim]], editor of [[Know Your Meme]], supported the work as genuine, citing his experiences with writing workshops on [[LiveJournal]] and [[Xanga]] where he encountered similar works, as "these were the kinds of things that would be formulated by a high-school teenager in the early 2000s".&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; Writing for [[Vulture.com]], Abraham Riesman wrote that "[t]he mystery of the authorship of 'My Immortal' — even in this privacy-averse age — appears unsolvable."&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

===2017: Rose Christo co-authorship claim===
Rose Christo, author of [[Young adult fiction|young adult novels]], began writing a memoir about her alleged experiences as a [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] child in the New York [[Foster care in the United States|foster care system]] titled ''Under the Same Stars: the Search for my Brother and the True Story of My Immortal''. The memoir details the period of time during which she allegedly co-wrote ''My Immortal''. [[Macmillan Publishers]] allegedly hired a lawyer to verify Christo's claims over the course of three days; she claimed to have provided proof through the email address with which she created the FanFiction.net account and a [[USB flash drive|flash drive]] containing the first eleven unedited chapters of ''My Immortal''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

In March 2017, Christo quietly stated on her [[Tumblr]] account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal''; however, the post gained little notice. In early August 2017, Christo posted an update to a previously unknown FictionPress account seemingly related to Tara Gilesbie that similarly received little attention.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/9/13/16275802/who-wrote-my-immortal-tara-rose-christo|title=My Immortal: solving the mystery of the internet’s most beloved — and notorious — fanfic|last=Romano|first=Aja|date=September 13, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 13, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in August, an [[Self-publishing|independently published]] ''Handbook for Mortals'' came to public attention after it was discovered that its sales were artificially inflated to push it to the top of the young adult [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], from which it was subsequently removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/la-et-jc-handbook-for-mortals-bestseller-ya-20170824-story.html |title=Did a YA book buy its way to the top of the New York Times bestseller list? |work=LA Times |author=Jessica Roy |date=August 24, 2017 |accessdate=August 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Italie&gt;{{cite news|last1=Italie|first1=Hillel|title=Book Pulled From Best-Seller List|url=http://time.com/4917209/ny-times-best-seller-handbook-for-mortals/|accessdate=September 11, 2017|work=Time|agency=Associated Press|date=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing similarities between the novel and ''My Immortal'' led to speculation that ''Handbook for Mortals'' author [[Lani Sarem]] was the author of ''My Immortal''. Christo again updated the FictionPress account to say she was not Sarem. She also posted on FictionPress to state that her only social media account was on Tumblr, which operated under her real name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/my-immortal-fanfic-2017-update/|title=Did the mysterious fanfic author behind ‘My Immortal’ just resurface?|last=Baker-Whitelaw|first=Gavia|date=August 31, 2017|website=|publisher=''[[The Daily Dot]]''|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170831214232/https://www.dailydot.com/parsec/my-immortal-fanfic-2017-update/|archive-date=2017-08-31|dead-url=no|access-date=August 31, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An editorial assistant at Macmillan Publishers also stated that Sarem was not the author of ''My Immortal'' and stated that MacMillan was to publish the author's memoir.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

These statements sparked a search for the claimed Tumblr account, which was found as Christo's in early September. By September 5, Christo stated on her Tumblr account that she co-wrote ''My Immortal'' and that she had provided proof to her publisher [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], later reported by [[BuzzFeed]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/my-immortal-author-hi-vampire|title=People Think They Have The Answer To The Decade-Long Mystery Of Who Wrote "My Immortal"|last=Bennett|first=Alanna|date=September 5, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Buzzfeed]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on September 7, BuzzFeed published her first official statement as the alleged author of ''My Immortal.''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/alannabennett/exclusive-first-look-under-same-stars-my-immortal-memoir|title=The Story Of "My Immortal" Is More Wild And Heartbreaking Than You Imagined|last=Bennett|first=Alanna|date=September 7, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Buzzfeed]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=September 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said of her decision to publicly identify herself as a co-author: "I would never have come forward about ''My&amp;nbsp;Immortal'' if not for the fact that it coincided with the things that happened to me as a teen."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Later that month, a forum post on Kiwi Farms, a forum notorious for perpetrating [[doxing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/selectall/2016/07/kiwi-farms-the-webs-biggest-community-of-stalkers.html|title=Kiwi Farms, the Web’s Biggest Community of Stalkers|last=Pless|first=Margaret|date= July 19, 2016|website=|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|access-date=November 4, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Christo's brother (the subject of her memoir), verified as such by the forum operators, refuted several of Christo's claims in the upcoming memoir, including those of their ancestry and shared childhood history.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hypable.com/my-immortal-and-5-unanswered-burning-questions/|title=The ‘My Immortal’ mystery grows: Five new questions after the memoir’s cancellation|last=Bryne-Cristiano|first=Laura|date=October 5, 2017|website=|publisher=Hypable|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The memoir was subsequently canceled by MacMillan after an investigation found factual errors in her narrative; Christo stated that these errors had been purposefully made in an attempt to protect her family's identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jarrylee/the-my-immortal-book-is-no-longer-going-to-be-published|title=The "My Immortal" Book Is No Longer Going To Be Published|last=Lee|first=Jarry|date=October 3, 2017|website=|publisher=[[Buzzfeed]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christo's brother has additionally said that he does not know if Christo wrote ''My Immortal'' and that she enjoyed ridiculing badly written fan fiction.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moviepilot.com/p/brother-of-my-immortal-author-casts-serious-doubt-on-her-claims/4383046|title=The Author Of 'My Immortal' Is A Fake And I Don't Know What To Believe Anymore|last=Tremeer|first=Eleanor|date=October 5, 2017|website=Movie Pilot|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=October 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Christo confirmed via Tumblr in October that her original name was Theresa Rose Christodoulopoulos, confirmed her brother's identity, conceded to many of his revelations about her, but also disagreed with a few of his claims and reiterated her claim that she was one of the authors of ''My Immortal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/post/166154457119/hey-guys-im-still-around-so-it-looks-like-a-few|title=kamakisikaw - Rose Christo's Tumblr account|last=Christo|first=Rose|date=October 7, 2017|website=[[Tumblr]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6u2t5THqM?url=https://rosechristo1.tumblr.com/post/166154457119/hey-guys-im-still-around-so-it-looks-like-a-few#|archive-date=2017-10-07|dead-url=yes|access-date=October 7, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She closed the Tumblr account a few days later. ''[[Vox (website)|Vox]]'' described Christo's authorship claim as one of the more likely claims she has made, though still in some doubt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vox.com/culture/2017/10/9/16428248/my-immortal-still-a-mystery-rose-christo-fake |title=The My Immortal memoir has been canceled, and the mystery of the notorious fanfic deepens |date=2017-10-09 |accessdate=2017-10-09 |publisher=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot summary==
The [[protagonist]] of the story is Ebony (occasionally Enoby, Eboby, Evony, Ebory, Enobby, Enopby, Egogy, Tara, or TaEbory) Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way, a seventeen-year-old [[vampire]] who attends [[Hogwarts]] (located in [[England]] instead of the original books' [[Scotland]]) as a member of [[Slytherin|Slytherin House]]. Hogwarts is depicted as being divided between two [[clique]]s, the "[[Goth subculture|goffs]]" and the [[Preppy|preps]]. Ebony and all the [[sympathetic character]]s are part of the goth clique while the members of the prep clique are portrayed unsympathetically. Many of the main characters of ''Harry Potter'' are given {{Sic|"goffik"}}  makeovers, moved to the Slytherin House, and renamed.

The story begins by focusing on Ebony entering a relationship with [[Draco Malfoy]], who is depicted as shy, sensitive and [[bisexuality|bisexual]]. Ebony and Draco have sex in the [[Hogwarts|Forbidden Forest]], but are witnessed by Hogwarts' principal [[Albus Dumbledore]] (often referred to as "Albert Dumblydore"), who yells at them and derides them as {{Sic|"motherfukers"}}. Later, after learning that Draco used to date [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry "Vampire" Potter]] (a nickname he gained because he "love[s] the taste of human blood"), Ebony becomes so angry that she runs crying into the Forbidden Forest, where she meets [[Lord Voldemort]]. Voldemort, speaking in faux-archaic English (unlike his teenaged self from the 80s), gives her a [[gun]] and demands that she kill "Vampire" Potter or else he will kill Draco, but Ebony refuses. Later on, Draco learns of this encounter and he is so angry that Ebony kept it from him that he commits [[suicide]] by [[self-harm|slitting his wrists]].

In a subsequent scene, however, Vampire has a [[vision (spirituality)|vision]] of Draco being held prisoner by Voldemort. The discrepancy between this and the earlier depiction of Draco having committed suicide is not explained. After rescuing Draco from Voldemort, Ebony and her friends attend a [[My Chemical Romance]] concert in [[Places in Harry Potter#Hogsmeade|Hogsmeade]]. After some songs have been played, the concert ends abruptly when the members of My Chemical Romance reveal themselves to be Voldemort and his [[Death Eater]]s. Voldemort, who had been disguised as lead vocalist [[Gerard Way]], proclaims his intent to kill Ebony and Draco for the former's failure to kill Vampire, but they are saved by Albus Dumbledore, who has just given himself a gothic makeover. The next day, Dumbledore gives a gothic makeover to the Hogwarts Great Hall as well, but Ebony feels that he is a [[poseur]] and dislikes him greatly, a sentiment shared by her friends.

During this time, [[Death Eater#Lucius Malfoy|Lucius Malfoy]] and [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Sirius Black|Sirius Black]] are inexplicably shot by a gun-toting "black guy" (likely meant to be [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] given the vampire themes). There is also a secondary plot point in which [[Professor Trelawney]] ("Trevolry") / [[Professor Sinistra]] ("Sinister", "Sinatra"), combined into one character, has an addiction to what is presumably the truth serum [[Veritaserum]]. A third plot point sees [[Hogwarts staff#Minerva McGonagall|Professor McGonagall]] (often referred to as "Mc[[Google]]" or "McGoggles") and [[Severus Snape]] (often called "Snap", or "Snope" at times) attempting to rape or harm the protagonists. Yet another plot point follows [[Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)#Remus Lupin|Remus Lupin]] and Snape being bisexuals who spy on Ebony, at one point resulting in a moment shortly after Draco's "death" where they are sitting on their broomsticks with "Loopin {{Sic|[[Masturbation|masticating]]}}" to Ebony bathing. In addition, [[Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]] is inexplicably a teenaged Hogwarts student who has a crush on Ebony, and who is also a Satanist.

Ebony begins having mysterious visions, which she is told indicates she must [[time travel|travel back in time]] (using a [[pensieve]]) to stop Tom Riddle from becoming Voldemort by seducing him, and to retrieve a cure for Sinister/Trevolry's addiction to "Volxemortserum". Arriving in the past, she meets the young Riddle, who calls himself "[[Satan]]", and who has been mistakenly referred to as "[[Neo (The Matrix)|Tom Anderson]]", "[[Tom Bombadil]]", and "Stan". "Satan" is in a band with [[James Potter (character)|James Potter]], Severus Snape, Sirius Black, and [[Lucius Malfoy]]. He is uncanonically depicted attending Hogwarts at the same time as the Marauders in what is further uncanonically portrayed as the 1980s. The author points out a few [[anachronism]]s in these scenes, telling readers to ignore them. There is also an unexplained cameo by a gothic [[Marty McFly]], who gives Ebony a black [[DeLorean time machine]] able to transform into an [[iPod]], allowing her to travel forward in time.

Eventually, Ebony brings "Satan" forward in time, where he morphs into the present-day Voldemort. This leads to a confrontation between the forces of good and evil in the Great Hall. The story ends ambiguously with Ebony firing off an [[Avada Kedavra]] curse, which is misrepresented as "[[abracadabra|abra kedabra]]".

==Reception==
{{Expand section|date=July 2016}}
Before its removal from FanFiction.Net, ''My Immortal'' allegedly gained between 8,000&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ultimate Guide to the Harry Potter Fandom|last=Payne|first=E.A.|publisher=Rowan Tree Books|year=2011|isbn=978-0615714912|location=|pages=141}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 10,000&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; reviews per posted chapter, most of which were negative and contained [[Flaming (Internet)|flaming]].&lt;ref name="TheVerge"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The quality of the writing and the author's apparently [[Goth subculture|Goth]] lifestyle also drew attacks and mockery from users on [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]], [[TV Tropes]], [[LiveJournal]], [[Something Awful]], [[YTMND]], and [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;

Rob Bricken of [[io9]] described the work as a "masterpiece of weirdness" and a "masterpiece of literary disaster".&lt;ref name="io9"/&gt; Mathilda Gregory of [[BuzzFeed]] called ''My Immortal'' a "work of comic genius" that is "oddly touching."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathildia/he-put-his-boys-thingy-in-mine|title=The Gloriously Immortal Life of “My Immortal”|last=Gregory|first=Mathilda|date=February 19, 2016|website=|publisher=[[BuzzFeed]]|accessdate=August 20, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916070128/https://www.buzzfeed.com/mathildia/he-put-his-boys-thingy-in-mine|archivedate=September 16, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The work is often cited as the worst fan fiction ever written&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TheVerge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMarySue"/&gt; or at least a "strong contender" for the title.&lt;ref name="DailyDot"/&gt; The work is considered "iconic" not only within the [[Harry Potter fandom|''Harry Potter'' fandom]] but also within the larger fan fiction community.&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TheMarySue" /&gt; 

The infamy of the work is considered a "constant millstone around the necks of fanfiction enthusiasts who struggle to bring legitimacy to the genre".&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt; Christo claimed in September 2017 that ''My Immortal'' is a work of satire, though any evidence of this is tied to her own claims of authorship.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2017/09/my-immortal-rose-christo-under-the-same-stars.html|title=Alleged Author of Legendarily Bad Fanfic ‘My Immortal’ Steps Forward, Announces Book Deal|last=Reisman |first=Abraham |date=September 7, 2017|publisher=[[Vulture (website) |Vulture]]|access-date=September 11, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Derivative works===
''My Immortal'' inspired further [[fan work]]s, including [[fan art]] and further fan fiction. It was the subject of numerous [[YouTube]] [[dramatic reading]]s intending to mock the work,&lt;ref name="Vulture"/&gt; and it later inspired a fifteen-episode web series satirizing the work.&lt;ref name="Vulture" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DailyDot" /&gt;

An '''old master print''' is a [[work of art]] produced by a [[printing]] process within the Western tradition. The term remains current in the [[art trade]], and there is no easy alternative in English to distinguish the works of "[[fine art]]" produced in [[printmaking]] from the vast range of decorative, utilitarian and [[popular prints]] that grew rapidly alongside the artistic print from the 15th century onwards. Fifteenth-century prints are sufficiently rare that they are classed as old master prints even if they are of crude or merely workmanlike artistic quality. A date of about 1830 is usually taken as marking the end of the period whose prints are covered by this term.

The main techniques used, in order of their introduction, are [[woodcut]], [[engraving]], [[etching]], [[mezzotint]] and [[aquatint]], although there are others. Different techniques are often combined in a single print.  With rare exceptions printed on textiles, such as silk, or on [[vellum]], old master prints are printed on [[paper]]. This article is concerned with the artistic, historical and social aspects of the subject; the article on [[printmaking]] summarizes the techniques used in making old master prints, from a modern perspective.

Many great European artists, such as [[Albrecht Dürer]], [[Rembrandt]], and [[Francisco Goya]], were dedicated printmakers. In their own day, their international reputations largely came from their prints, which were spread far more widely than their paintings. Influences between artists were also mainly transmitted beyond a single city by prints (and sometimes drawings), for the same reason. Prints therefore are frequently brought up in detailed analyses of individual paintings in [[art history]].  Today, thanks to colour photo reproductions, and public galleries, their paintings are much better known, whilst their prints are only rarely exhibited, for conservation reasons.  But some museum [[print room]]s allow visitors to see their collection, sometimes only by appointment.

==History==

===Woodcut before Albrecht Dürer===
The oldest technique is woodcut, or woodblock printing, which was invented as a method for printing on cloth in China, and perhaps separately in Egypt in the [[Byzantine]] period. This had reached Europe via the [[Byzantine]] or [[Islamic]] worlds before 1300, as a method of printing patterns on textiles. [[Paper]] arrived in Europe, also from China via [[Islamic Spain]], slightly later, and was being manufactured in Italy by the end of the thirteenth century, and in Burgundy and Germany by the end of the fourteenth.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1980), 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Religious images and [[playing cards]] are documented as being produced on paper, probably printed, by a German in [[Bologna]] in 1395.&lt;ref&gt;Field, Richard (1965). ''Fifteenth Century Woodcuts and Metalcuts''. Washington, D.C.: National Gallery of Art.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the most impressive printed European images to survive from before 1400 are printed on cloth, for use as hangings on walls or furniture, including altars and [[lectern]]s. Some were used as a pattern to embroider over. Some religious images were used as bandages, to speed healing.&lt;ref&gt;Hind (1935).&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest print images are mostly of a high artistic standard, and were clearly designed by artists with a background in painting (on walls, panels or manuscripts). Whether these artists cut the blocks themselves, or only inked the design on the block for another to carve, is not known. During the fifteenth century the number of prints produced greatly increased as paper became freely available and cheaper, and the average artistic level fell, so that by the second half of the century the typical woodcut is a relatively crude image. The great majority of surviving 15th-century prints are religious, although these were probably the ones more likely to survive. Their makers were sometimes called "Jesus maker" or "saint-maker" in documents. As with manuscript books, monastic institutions sometimes produced, and often sold, prints. No artists can be identified with specific woodcuts until towards the end of the century.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 1–6, quotes 2, 33–42. Mayor, 5–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The little evidence we have suggests that woodcut prints became relatively common and cheap during the fifteenth century, and were affordable by skilled workers in towns. For example, what may be the earliest surviving Italian print, the "Madonna of the Fire", was hanging by a nail to a wall in a small school in [[Forlì]] in 1428. The school caught fire, and the crowd who gathered to watch saw the print carried up into the air by the fire, before falling down into the crowd. This was regarded as a miraculous escape and the print was carried to [[Forlì Cathedral]], where it remains, since 1636 in a special chapel, displayed once a year. Like the majority of prints before approximately 1460, only a single impression (the term used for a copy of an old master print; "copy" is used for a print copying another print) of this print has survived.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:5086 bassenge german 1480.jpg|thumb|left|230px|Anonymous German 15th century woodcut, about 1480, with hand-colouring, including (unusually) spots of gold. 5.2 x 3.9 cm (similar to the original size on most screens)]]
[[File:Saint Christopher. Woodcut. Wellcome V0031876.jpg|thumb|230px|A woodcut of St Christopher dated 1420]]
Woodcut blocks are printed with light pressure, and are capable of printing several thousand impressions, and even at this period some prints may well have been produced in that quantity. Many prints were hand-coloured, mostly in [[watercolour]]; in fact the hand-colouring of prints continued for many centuries, though dealers have removed it from many surviving examples. Italy, Germany, France and the Netherlands were the main areas of production; England does not seem to have produced any prints until about 1480. However prints are highly portable, and were transported across Europe. A Venetian document of 1441 already complains about cheap imports of [[playing cards]] damaging the local industry.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Block book|Block-books]] were a very popular form of (short) book, where a page with both pictures and text was cut as a single woodcut. They were much cheaper than manuscript books, and were mostly produced in the Netherlands; the ''Art of Dying'' ([[Ars moriendi]]) was the most famous; thirteen different sets of blocks are known.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 24–27.&lt;/ref&gt; As a relief technique (see [[printmaking]]) woodcut can be printed easily together with movable type, and after this invention arrived in Europe about 1450 printers quickly came to include woodcuts in their books. Some book owners also pasted prints into prayer books in particular.&lt;ref&gt;A number have survived pasted on the inside of the lids of boxes or chests, like  [http://gallica.bnf.fr/anthologie/notices/00340.htm this example].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Playing card]]s were another notable use of prints, and French versions are the basis of the traditional sets still in use today.

By the last quarter of the century there was a large demand for woodcuts for book-illustrations, and in both Germany and Italy standards at the top end of the market improved considerably. [[Nuremberg]] was the largest centre of German publishing, and [[Michael Wolgemut]], the master of the largest workshop there worked on many projects, including the gigantic [[Nuremberg Chronicle]].&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 34–42. Mayor, 32–60. Bartrum (1995), 17–19.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albrecht Dürer]] was apprenticed to Wolgemut during the early stages of the project, and was the godson of Anton Koberger, its printer and publisher. Dürer's career was to take the art of the woodcut to its highest development.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, 17–63. Landau and Parshall, 167–174.&lt;/ref&gt;

===German engraving before Dürer===
[[File:Martyrium des hl. Sebastian (Meister der Spielkarten).jpg|thumb|"Martyrdom of [[St Sebastian]]", engraving by the [[Master of the Playing Cards]], c. 1445]]

Engraving on metal was part of the [[goldsmith]]'s craft throughout the Medieval period, and the idea of printing engraved designs onto paper probably began as a method for them to record the designs on pieces they had sold. Some artists trained as painters became involved from about 1450–1460, although many engravers continued to come from a goldsmithing background. From the start, engraving was in the hands of the luxury tradesmen, unlike woodcut, where at least the cutting of the block was associated with the lower-status trades of carpentry, and perhaps sculptural wood-carving. Engravings were also important from very early on as models for other artists, especially painters and sculptors, and many works survive, especially from smaller cities, which take their compositions directly from prints. Serving as a pattern for artists may have been a primary purpose for the creation of many prints, especially the numerous series of [[Twelve apostles|apostle]] figures.

The surviving engravings, though the majority are religious, show a greater proportion of secular images than other types of art from the period, including [[woodcut]]. This is certainly partly the result of the relative survival rates—although wealthy fifteenth-century houses certainly contained secular images on walls (inside and outside), and cloth hangings, these types of image have survived in tiny numbers. The Church was much better at retaining its images. Engravings were relatively expensive and sold to an urban middle-class that had become increasingly affluent in the belt of cities that stretched from the Netherlands down the Rhine to Southern Germany, Switzerland and Northern Italy. Engraving was also used for the same types of images as [[woodcut]]s, notably devotional images and [[playing cards]], but many seem to have been collected for keeping out of sight in an album or book, to judge by the excellent state of preservation of many pieces of paper over five hundred years old.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 46–51, 64.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Maître E. S. Les Amoureux sur un banc de gazon L.211.jpg|thumb|[[Master E. S.]], "''Liebespaar auf der Rasenbank''"]]
Again unlike woodcut, identifiable artists are found from the start. The German, or possibly German-Swiss, [[Master of the Playing Cards]] was active by at least the 1440s; he was clearly a trained painter.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967a), numbers 1–2. Mayor, 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Master E. S.]] was a prolific engraver, from a [[goldsmith]]ing background, active from about 1450–1467, and the first to sign his prints with a monogram in the plate. He made significant technical developments, which allowed more impressions to be taken from each plate. Many of his faces have a rather pudding-like appearance, which reduces the impact of what are otherwise fine works. Much of his work still has great charm, and the secular and comic subjects he engraved are almost never found in the surviving painting of the period. Like the Otto prints in Italy, much of his work was probably intended to appeal to women.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967b). Shestack (1967a), numbers 4–19. Spangeberg, 1–3. Mayor, 118–123. Landau and Parshall, 46–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first major artist to engrave was [[Martin Schongauer]] (c. 1450–1491), who worked in southern Germany and was also a well-known painter. His father and brother were goldsmiths, so he may well have had experience with the burin from an early age. His 116 engravings have a clear authority and beauty and became well known in Italy as well as northern Europe, as well as much copied by other engravers. He also further developed engraving technique, in particular refining [[cross-hatching]] to depict volume and shade in a purely linear medium.&lt;ref&gt;Shestack (1967a), numbers 34–115. Landau and Parshall, 50–56. Mayor, 130–135. Spangeberg, 5–7. Bartrum, 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notable artist of this period is known as the [[Housebook Master]]. He was a highly talented German artist who is also known from drawings, especially the Housebook album from which he takes his name. His prints were made exclusively in [[drypoint]], scratching his lines on the plate to leave a much shallower line than an engraver's [[Burin (engraving)|burin]] would produce; he may have invented this technique. Consequently, only a few impressions could be produced from each plate—perhaps about twenty—although some plates were reworked to prolong their life. Despite this limitation, his prints were clearly widely circulated, as many copies of them exist by other printmakers. This is highly typical of admired prints in all media until at least 1520; there was no enforceable concept of anything like copyright. Many of the Housebook Master's print compositions are only known from copies, as none of the presumed originals have survived — a very high proportion of his original prints are only known from a single impression. The largest collection of his prints is at Amsterdam; these were probably kept as a collection, perhaps by the artist himself, from around the time of their creation.&lt;ref&gt;Filedt Kok. Mayor, 124–129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Meckenem.jpg|thumb|The first self-portrait, by the first businessman in the history of printmaking, [[Israhel van Meckenam]], with his wife]]
[[Israhel van Meckenam]] was an engraver from the borders of Germany and the Netherlands, who probably trained with Master ES, and ran the most productive workshop for engravings of the century between about 1465 and 1503. He produced over 600 plates, most copies of other prints, and was more sophisticated in self-presentation, signing later prints with his name and town, and producing the first print self-portrait of himself and his wife. Some plates seem to have been reworked more than once by his workshop, or produced in more than one version, and many impressions have survived, so his ability to distribute and sell his prints was evidently sophisticated. His own compositions are often very lively, and take a great interest in the secular life of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 56–63. Mayor, 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The earliest Italian engravings===
Printmaking in [[woodcut]] and [[engraving]] both appeared in Northern Italy within a few decades of their invention north of the Alps, and had similar uses and characters, though within significantly different artistic styles, and with from the start a much greater proportion of secular subjects. The earliest known Italian woodcut has been mentioned above. Engraving probably came first to [[Florence]] in the 1440s; [[Vasari]] typically claimed that his fellow-Florentine, the goldsmith and [[niello]]ist [[Maso Finiguerra]] (1426–64) invented the technique. It is now clear this is wrong, and there are now considered to be no prints as such that can be attributed to him on anything other than a speculative basis. He may never have made any printed engravings from plates, as opposed to taking impressions from work intended to be nielloed. There are a number of complex [[niello]] religious scenes that he probably executed, and may or may not have designed, which were influential for the Florentine style in engraving. Some paper impressions and sulphur casts survive from these. These are a number of paxes in the [[Bargello]], Florence, plus one in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York which depict scenes with large and well-organised crowds of small figures. There are also drawings in the [[Uffizi, Florence]] that may be by him.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson. Landau and Parshall, 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florence====
[[File:Battle of the Naked Men MetNY.jpg|thumb|[[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], "[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nude Men]]"]]
Where German engraving arrived into a still [[Gothic art]]istic world, Italian engraving caught the very early Renaissance, and from the start the prints are mostly larger, more open in atmosphere, and feature classical and exotic subjects. They are less densely worked, and usually do not use cross-hatching. From about 1460–1490 two styles developed in Florence, which remained the largest centre of Italian engraving. These are called (although the terms are less often used now) the "Fine Manner" and the "Broad Manner", referring to the typical thickness of the lines used. The leading artists in the Fine Manner are [[Baccio Baldini]] and the "Master of the Vienna Passion", and in the Broad Manner, [[Francesco Rosselli]] and [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], whose only print was the ''[[Battle of the Nudes (engraving)|Battle of the Nude Men]]'' (right), the masterpiece of 15th-century Florentine engraving.&lt;ref&gt;Langdale. Landau and Parshall, 65, 72–76.&lt;/ref&gt; This uses a new zigzag "return stroke" for modelling, which he probably invented.&lt;ref&gt;Langdale.&lt;/ref&gt;

A chance survival is a collection of mostly rather crudely executed Florentine prints now in the [[British Museum]], known as the Otto Prints after an earlier owner of most of them. This was probably the workshop's own reference set of prints, mostly round or oval, that were used to decorate the inside covers of boxes, primarily for female use. It has been suggested that boxes so decorated may have been given as gifts at weddings. The subject matter and execution of this group suggests they were intended to appeal to middle-class female taste; lovers and cupids abound, and an [[allegory]] shows a near-naked young man tied to a stake and being beaten by several women.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 89. Levinson.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ferrara ====
The other notable early centre was [[Ferrara]], from the 1460s, which probably produced both sets of the so-called "[[Mantegna Tarocchi]]" cards, which are not playing cards, but a sort of educational tool for young humanists with fifty cards, featuring the Planets and Spheres, [[Apollo]] and the [[Muses]], personifications of the Seven [[liberal arts]] and the four Virtues, as well as "the Conditions of Man" from Pope to peasant.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 71–72. Spangeberg, 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mantegna in Mantua====
[[File:Herkules und Antäus (Mantegna).jpg|thumb|left|"[[Hercules]] and [[Antaeus]]", [[engraving]], 1490–1500, School of Mantegna&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, no. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Andrea Mantegna]] who trained in [[Padua]], and then settled in [[Mantua]], was the most influential figure in Italian engraving of the century, although it is still debated whether he actually engraved any plates himself (a debate revived in recent years by [[Suzanne Boorsch]]). A number of engravings have long been ascribed to his school or workshop, with only seven usually given to him personally. The whole group form a coherent stylistic group and very clearly reflect his style in painting and drawing, or copy surviving works of his. They seem to date from the late 1460s onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 65–71. Mayor, 187–197. Spangeberg, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The impact of Dürer===
{{Main|Albrecht Dürer}}

In the last five years of the fifteenth century, Dürer, then in his late twenties and with his own workshop in Nuremberg, began to produce woodcuts and engravings of the highest quality which spread very quickly through the artistic centres of Europe. By about 1505 most young Italian printmakers went through a phase of directly copying either whole prints or large parts of Dürer's landscape backgrounds, before going on to adapt his technical advances to their own style. Copying of prints was already a large and accepted part of the printmaking culture but no prints were copied as frequently as Dürer's.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (2002). Bartrum (1995), 22–63. Landau and Parshall, see index. Mayor, 258–281.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer was also a painter, but few of his paintings could be seen except by those with good access to private houses in the Nuremberg area. The lesson of how he, following more spectacularly in the footsteps of Schongauer and Mantegna, was able so quickly to develop a continent-wide reputation very largely through his prints was not lost on other painters, who began to take much greater interest in printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, 347–358. Bartrum (1995), 9–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy 1500–1515===
For a brief period a number of artists who began by copying Dürer made very fine prints in a range of individual styles. They included [[Giulio Campagnola]], who succeeded in translating the new style [[Giorgione]] and [[Titian]] had brought to [[Venice|Venetian]] painting into engraving. [[Marcantonio Raimondi]] and [[Agostino Veneziano]] both spent some years in Venice before moving to [[Rome]], but even their early prints show classicizing tendencies as well as Northern influence.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, see index.&lt;/ref&gt; The styles of the Florentine [[Cristofano Robetta]], and [[Benedetto Montagna]] from [[Vicenza]] are still based in Italian painting of the period, and are also later influenced by [[Giulio Campagnola]].&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, 289–334, 390–414. Landau and Parshall, 65–102 (see also index). Mayor, 143–156, 173, 223, 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giovanni Battista Palumba]], once known as "Master IB with the Bird" from his monogram, was the major Italian artist in [[woodcut]] in these years, as well as an engraver of charming mythological scenes, often with an erotic theme.&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, 440–455. Landau and Parshall, 199, 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The rise of the reproductive print===
[[File:Moses (Matham).jpg|thumb|Reproductive engraving by [[Jacob Matham]], in this case of a [[sculpture]], "[[Moses]]", by [[Michelangelo]], 1593]]

Prints copying prints were already common, and many fifteenth century prints must have been copies of paintings, but not intended to be seen as such, but as images in their own right. [[Andrea Mantegna|Mantegna]]'s workshop produced a number of engravings copying his ''Triumph of Caesar'' (now [[Hampton Court Palace]]), or drawings for it, which were perhaps the first prints intended to be understood as depicting paintings—called ''reproductive prints''. With an increasing pace of innovation in art, and of a critical interest among a non-professional public, reliable depictions of paintings filled an obvious need. In time this demand was almost to smother the old master print.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau &amp; Parshall, chapter IV, whose emphasis is disputed by Bury, 9–12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dürer never copied any of his paintings directly into prints, although some of his portraits base a painting and a print on the same drawing, which is very similar. The next stage began when [[Titian]] in Venice, and [[Raphael]] in Rome, almost simultaneously began to collaborate with printmakers to make prints to their designs. Titian at this stage worked with Domenico Campagnola and others on woodcuts, whilst Raphael worked with Raimondi on engravings, for which many of Raphael's drawings survive.&lt;ref&gt;Pon. Landau and Parshall, 117–146.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather later, the paintings done by the [[School of Fontainebleau]] were copied in etchings, apparently in a brief organised programme including many of the painters themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, parts III and IV.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian partnerships were artistically and commercially successful, and inevitably attracted other printmakers who simply copied paintings independently to make wholly reproductive prints. Especially in Italy, these prints, of greatly varying quality, came to dominate the market and tended to push out original printmaking, which declined noticeably from about 1530–40 in Italy. By now some publisher/dealers had become important, especially Dutch and Flemish operators like [[Philippe Galle]] and [[Hieronymus Cock]], developing networks of distribution that were becoming international, and much work was commissioned by them.  The effect of the development of the print-selling trade is a matter of scholarly controversy, but there is no question that by the mid-century the rate of original printmaking in Italy had declined considerably from that of a generation earlier, if not as precipitously as in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall develop the traditional view of decline, which Bury contests in his Introduction, pp.&amp;nbsp;9–12, and seeks to demonstrate the opposite view throughout his work.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The North after Dürer===
[[File:5168 bassenge leyden.jpg|thumb|left|"The Milkmaid'", engraving by [[Lucas van Leyden]], 1510]]

Although no artist anywhere from 1500 to 1550 could ignore Dürer, several artists in his wake had no difficulty maintaining highly distinctive styles, often with little influence from him.   [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] was only a year younger than Dürer, but he was about thirty before he began to make woodcuts, in an intense Northern style reminiscent of [[Matthias Grünewald]].  He was also an early experimenter in the [[chiaroscuro]] woodcut technique.  His style later softened, and took in the influence of Dürer, but he concentrated his efforts on painting, in which he became dominant in Protestant Germany, based in [[Saxony]], handing over his very productive studio to his son at a relatively early age.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 166–178.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lucas van Leyden]] had a prodigious natural talent for engraving, and his earlier prints were highly successful, with an often earthy treatment and brilliant technique, so that he came to be seen as Dürer's main rival in the North. However, his later prints suffered from straining after an Italian grandeur, which left only the technique applied to far less dynamic compositions. Like Dürer, he had a "flirtation" with etching, but on copper rather than iron. His Dutch successors for some time continued to be heavily under the spell of Italy, which they took most of the century to digest.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 316–319, 332–333, 333 quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albrecht Altdorfer]] produced some Italianate religious prints, but he is most famous for his very Northern landscapes of drooping larches and firs, which are highly innovative in painting as well as prints.  He was among the most effective early users of the technique of [[etching]], recently invented as a printmaking technique by [[Daniel Hopfer]], an armourer from [[Augsburg]]. Neither Hopfer nor the other members of his family who continued his style were trained or natural artists, but many of their images have great charm, and their "ornament prints", made essentially as patterns for craftsmen in various fields, spread their influence widely.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 228, 304–308, 567. Bartrum (1995), 11–12, 144, 158, 183–197. Landau and Parshall, 323–328 (Hopfers); 202–209, 337–346 (Altdorfer).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Burgkmair]] from [[Augsburg]], [[Nuremberg]]'s neighbour and rival, was slightly older than Dürer, and had a parallel career in some respects, training with [[Martin Schongauer]] before apparently visiting Italy, where he formed his own synthesis of Northern and Italian styles, which he applied in painting and woodcut, mostly for books, but with many significant "single-leaf" (i.e. individual) prints. He is now generally credited with inventing the coloured [[Chiaroscuro woodcut|chiaroscuro (coloured) woodcut]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 130–146. Landau and Parshall, see index, 179–202 on the chiaroscuro woodcut.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Baldung]] was Dürer's pupil, and was left in charge of the Nuremberg workshop during Dürer's second Italian trip. He had no difficulty in maintaining a highly personal style in woodcut, and produced some very powerful images.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Urs Graf]] was a Swiss mercenary and printmaker, who invented the [[white-line woodcut]] technique, in which his most distinctive prints were made.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 212–221.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Little Masters===
[[File:The Little Fool.jpg|thumb|left|"The Little Fool" by [[Sebald Beham]], 1542, 4.4 x 8.1 cm]]

The [[Little Masters]] is a term for a group of several printmakers, who all produced very small finely detailed engravings for a largely bourgeois market, combining in miniature elements from Dürer and from [[Marcantonio Raimondi]], and concentrating on secular, often mythological and erotic, rather than on religious themes.  The most talented were the brothers [[Bartel Beham]] and the longer-lived [[Sebald Beham]].  Like [[Georg Pencz]], they came from Nuremberg and were expelled by the council for [[atheism]] for a period.  The other principal member of the group was [[Heinrich Aldegrever]], a convinced [[Lutheran]] with [[Anabaptist]] leanings, who was perhaps therefore forced to spend much of his time producing ornament prints.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 99–129. Mayor, 315–317. Landau and Parshall, 315–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another convinced Protestant, [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], spent most of his adult career in England, then and for long after too primitive as both a market and in technical assistance to support fine printmaking. Whilst the famous blockcutter Hans Lützelburger was alive, he created from Holbein's designs the famous small woodcut series of the ''Dance of Death''. Another Holbein series, of ninety-one Old Testament scenes, in a much simpler style, was the most popular of attempts by several artists to create Protestant religious imagery. Both series were published in [[Lyon]] in France by a German publisher, having been created in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 221–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the deaths of this very brilliant generation, both the quality and quantity of German original printmaking suffered a strange collapse; perhaps it became impossible to sustain a convincing Northern style in the face of overwhelming Italian productions in a "commoditized" Renaissance style. The Netherlands now became more important for the production of prints, which would remain the case until the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum (1995), 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mannerist printmaking==
[[File:5136 bassenge ghisi.jpg|thumb|left|"[[Hercules]]", engraving by [[Giorgio Ghisi]], after Bertani, 1558]]

Some Italian printmakers went in a very different direction to either Raimondi and his followers, or the Germans, and used the medium for experimentation and very personal work. [[Parmigianino]] produced some etchings himself, and also worked closely with [[Ugo da Carpi]] on chiaroscuro woodcuts and other prints.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Parshall, 146–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Giorgio Ghisi]] was the major printmaker of the Mantuan school, which preserved rather more individuality than Rome.  Much of his work was reproductive, but his original prints are often very fine.  He visited Antwerp, a reflection of the power the publishers there now had over what was now a European market for prints. A number of printmakers, mostly in etching, continued to produce excellent prints, but mostly as a sideline to either painting or reproductive printmaking.  They include [[Battista Franco]], [[Il Schiavone]], [[Federico Barocci]] and [[Ventura Salimbeni]], who only produced nine prints, presumably because it did not pay. [[Annibale Carracci]] and his cousin [[Ludovico Carracci|Ludovico]] produced a few influential etchings, while Annibale's brother Agostino engraved. Both brothers influenced [[Guido Reni]] and other Italian artists of the full [[Baroque]] period in the next century.&lt;ref&gt;Bury. Reed and Walsh, 105–114 on Annibale and subsequent artists in etching. Mayor, 410, 516.&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
The Italian artists known as the [[School of Fontainebleau]] were hired in the 1530s by King [[Francis I of France]] to decorate his showpiece Chateau at Fontainebleau. In the course of the long project, etchings were produced, in unknown circumstances but apparently in Fontainebleau itself and mostly in the 1540s, mostly recording wall-paintings and plasterwork in the Chateau (much now destroyed). Technically they are mostly rather poor—dry and uneven—but the best powerfully evoke the strange and sophisticated atmosphere of the time.  Many of the best are by [[Leon Davent]] to designs by [[Primaticcio]], or [[Antonio Fantuzzi]]. Several of the artists, including Davent, later went to Paris and continued to produce prints there.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobson, parts III and IV. Mayor, 354–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously the only consistent printmaker of stature in France had been [[Jean Duvet]], a goldsmith whose highly personal style seems halfway between Dürer and [[William Blake]].  His plates are extremely crowded, not conventionally well-drawn, but full of intensity; the opposite of the languorous elegance of the Fontainebleau prints, which were to have the greater effect on French printmaking. His prints date from 1520 to 1555, when he was seventy, and completed his masterpiece, the twenty-three prints of the Apocalypse.&lt;ref&gt;Marqusee. Jacobson, part II. Mayor, 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Netherlands===
[[File:GoltziusFarneseHerc.jpg|thumb|The "[[Farnese Hercules]]", engraving by [[Hendrick Goltzius|Goltzius]]]]

[[Cornelius Cort]] was an Antwerp engraver, trained in Cock's publishing house, with a controlled but vigorous style, and excellent at depicting dramatic lighting effects. He went to Italy and in 1565 was retained by [[Titian]] to produce prints of his paintings (Titian having secured his "privileges" or rights to exclusively reproduce his own works).  Titian took considerable trouble to get the effect he wanted; he said that Cort could not work from the painting alone, so he produced special [[drawing]]s for him to use. Eventually, the results were highly effective and successful, and after Titian's death Cort moved to Rome, where he taught a number of the most successful printmakers of the next generation, notably [[Hendrik Goltzius]], [[Francesco Villamena]] and [[Agostino Carracci]], the last major Italian artist to resist the spread of etching.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 403–407, 410.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goltzius, arguably the last great engraver, took Cort's style to its furthest point. Because of a childhood accident, he drew with his whole arm, and his use of the swelling line, altering the profile of the burin to thicken or diminish the line as it moved, is unmatched.  He was extraordinarily prolific, and the artistic, if not the technical, quality of his work is very variable, but his finest prints look forward to the energy of Rubens, and are as sensuous in their use of line as he is in paint.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 419–421. Spangeberg, 107–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time [[Pieter Brueghel the elder]], another Cort-trained artist, who escaped to paint, was producing prints in a totally different style; beautifully drawn but simply engraved.  He only etched one plate himself, a superb landscape, the ''Rabbit Hunters'', but produced many drawings for the Antwerp specialists to work up, of peasant life, satires, and newsworthy events.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 422–426.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, numerous other engravers in the Netherlands continued to produce vast numbers of reproductive and illustrative prints of widely varying degrees of quality and appeal—the two by no means always going together. Notable dynasties, often publishers as well as artists,  include the [[Wierix family]], the Saenredams, and [[Aegidius Sadeler]] and several of his relations. [[Philippe Galle]] founded another long-lived family business. [[Theodor de Bry]] specialised in illustrating books on new colonial areas.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 373–376, 408–410.&lt;/ref&gt;

==17th century==
[[File:Rembrandt aux yeux hagards.jpg|thumb|left|Self-portrait by [[Rembrandt]], 1630]]

The 17th century saw a continuing increase in the volume of commercial and reproductive printmaking; [[Rubens]], like Titian before him, took great pains in adapting the trained engravers in his workshop to the particular style he wanted, though several found his demands too much and left.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 427–432.&lt;/ref&gt; The generation after him produced a number of widely dispersed printmakers with very individual and personal styles; by now etching had become the normal medium for such artists.

[[Rembrandt]] bought a printing-press for his house in the days of his early prosperity, and continued to produce etchings (always so called collectively, although Rembrandt mixed techniques by adding engraving and drypoint to some of his etchings) until his bankruptcy, when he lost both house and press.  Fortunately his prints have always been keenly collected, and what seems to be a high proportion of his intermediate states have survived, often in only one or two impressions. He was clearly very directly involved in the printing process himself, and probably selectively wiped the plate of ink himself to produce effects ''surface tone'' on many impressions.  He also experimented continually with the effects of different papers. He produced prints on a wider range of subjects than his paintings, with several pure landscapes, many self-portraits that are often more extravagantly fanciful than his painted ones, some erotic (at any rate obscene) subjects, and a great number of religious prints. He became increasingly interested in strong lighting effects, and very dark backgrounds. His reputation as the greatest etcher in the history of the medium was established in his lifetime, and never questioned since. Few of his paintings left Holland whilst he lived, but his prints were circulated throughout Europe, and his wider reputation was initially based on them alone.&lt;ref&gt;White; Mayor, 472–505; Spangeberg, 164–168.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch artists of the century]]  produced original prints of quality, mostly sticking to the same categories of genre they painted.  The eccentric [[Hercules Seghers]] and [[Jacob van Ruysdael]] produced landscapes in very small quantities, [[Nicolaes Berchem]] and [[Karel Dujardin]] Italianate landscapes with animals and figures, and [[Adriaen van Ostade]] peasant scenes.  None was very prolific, but the Italianate landscape was the most popular type of subject; Berchem had a greater income from his prints than his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 467–471. Spangeberg, 156–158 (Seghers), 170 (van Ostade), 177 (Berchem).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Die Auferweckung das Lazarus (Castiglione).jpg|thumb|"The Raising of Lazarus", etching by [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione|Castiglione]]]]
[[File:Jacques Callot Massacre des Innocents.jpg|thumb|"Massacre of the Innocents", by [[Jacques Callot|Callot]], 13.7 x 10.5 cm, showing the use of multiple stoppings-out]]

[[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]] grew up in [[Genoa]] and was greatly influenced by the stays there of Rubens and [[van Dyck]] when he was a young artist. His etching technique was extremely fluent, and in all mediums he often repeats the same few subjects in a large number of totally different compositions. His early prints include a number of bravura treatments of classical and pastoral themes, whilst later religious subjects predominate.  He also produced a large series of small heads of exotically dressed men, which were often used by other artists. He was technically innovative, inventing the [[monotype]] and also the [[oil sketch]] intended to be a final product. He, like Rembrandt, was interested in [[chiaroscuro]] effects (contrasts of light and dark), using a number of very different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 262–271. Mayor, 526–527.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jusepe de Ribera]] may have learned etching in Rome, but all his fewer than thirty prints were made in [[Naples]] during the 1620s when his career as a painter seems to have been in the doldrums.  When the painting commissions began to flow again, he all but abandoned printmaking. His plates were sold after his death to a Rome publisher, who made a better job of marketing them than Ribera himself. His powerful and direct style developed almost immediately, and his subjects and style remain close to those of his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 279–285.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacques Bellange]] was a court painter in [[Duchy of Lorraine|Lorraine]], a world that was to vanish abruptly in the [[Thirty Years War]] shortly after his death. No surviving painting of his can be identified with confidence, and most of those sometimes attributed to him are unimpressive. His prints, mostly religious, are Baroque extravaganzas that were regarded with horror by many 19th century critics, but have come strongly back into fashion—the very different Baroque style of another Lorraine artist [[Georges de La Tour]] has enjoyed a comparable revival. He was the first Lorraine printmaker (or artist) of stature, and must have influenced the younger [[Jacques Callot]], who remained in Lorraine but was published in [[Paris]], where he greatly influenced French printmaking.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Hartley. Jacobson, part X. Mayor, 453–460.&lt;/ref&gt;

Callot's technical innovations in improving the recipes for etching ground were crucial in allowing etching to rival the detail of engraving, and in the long term spelt the end of artistic engraving. Previously the unreliable nature of the grounds used meant that artists could not risk investing too much effort in an etched plate, as the work might be ruined by leaks in the ground. Equally, multiple stoppings-out, enabling lines etched to different depths by varying lengths of exposure to the acid, had been too risky.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 455–460.&lt;/ref&gt; Callot led the way in exploiting the new possibilities; most of his etchings are small but full of tiny detail, and he developed a sense of recession in landscape backgrounds in etching with multiple bitings to etch the background more lightly than the foreground. He also used a special etching needle called an ''échoppe'' to produce swelling lines like those created by the burin in an engraving, and also reinforced the etched lines with a burin after biting; which soon became common practice among etchers.  Callot etched a great variety of subjects in over 1400 prints, from grotesques to his tiny but extremely powerful series ''[[Les Grandes Misères de la guerre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Hind (1923), 158–160.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham Bosse]], a Parisian illustrative etcher popularized Callot's methods in a hugely successful manual for students. His own work is successful in his declared aim of making etchings look like engravings, and is highly evocative of French life at the middle of the century. 
[[File:6409 bassenge2vaillerant.jpg|thumb|left|Early [[mezzotint]] by [[Wallerant Vaillant]], Siegen's assistant or tutor]]

[[Wenzel Hollar]] was a [[Bohemia]]n ([[Czechs|Czech]]) artist who fled his country in the Thirty Years War, settling mostly in England (he was besieged at [[Basing House]] in the [[English Civil War]], and then followed his Royalist patron into a new exile in Antwerp, where he worked with a number of the large publishers there). He produced great numbers of etchings in a straightforward realist style, many topographical, including large [[Bird's-eye view|aerial views]], portraits, and others showing costumes, occupations and pastimes.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 344.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Stefano della Bella]] was something of an Italian counterpart to Callot, producing many very detailed small etchings, but also larger and freer works, closer to the Italian drawing tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Reed and Wallace, 234–243. Mayor, 520–521, 538, 545.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony van Dyck]] produced only a large series of portrait prints of contemporary notables, the ''Iconographia'' for which he only etched a few of the heads himself, but in a brilliant style, that had great influence on 19th century etching.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 433–435.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ludwig von Siegen]] was a German soldier and courtier, who invented the technique of [[mezzotint]], which in the hands of better artists than he was to become an important, mostly reproductive, technique in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1980), 83–88. Mayor, 511–515.&lt;/ref&gt;

The last third of the century produced relatively little original printmaking of great interest, although illustrative printmaking reached a high level of quality. French portrait prints, most often copied from paintings, were the finest in Europe and often extremely brilliant, with the school including both etching and engraving, often in the same work. The most important artists were [[Claude Mellan]], an etcher from the 1630s onwards, and his contemporary {{Interlanguage link multi|Jean Morin (engraver)|fr|3=Jean Morin (artiste)}}, whose combination of engraving and etching influenced many later artists.  [[Robert Nanteuil]] was official portrait engraver to [[Louis XIV]], and produced over two hundred brilliantly engraved portraits of the court and other notable French figures.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 289–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==18th century==
[[File:Piranesi-Ponte-Milvio.jpg|thumb|One of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]]'s views of Rome]]

The extremely popular engravings of [[William Hogarth]] in England were little concerned with technical printmaking effects; in many he was producing reproductive prints of his own paintings (a surprisingly rare thing to do) that only set out to convey his crowded moral compositions as clearly as possible. It would not be possible, without knowing, to distinguish these from his original prints, which have the same aim. He priced his prints to reach a middle and even upper working-class market, and was brilliantly successful in this.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 550–555.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canaletto]] was also a highly successful painter, and though his relatively few prints are [[vedute]], they are rather different from his painted ones, and fully aware of the possibilities of the etching medium.  [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi|Piranesi]] was primarily a printmaker, a technical innovator who extended the life of his plates beyond what was previously possible.  His ''Views of Rome''—well over a hundred huge plates—were backed by a serious understanding of Roman and modern architecture and brilliantly exploit the drama both of the ancient ruins and Baroque Rome.  Many prints of Roman views had been produced before, but Piranesi's vision has become the benchmark.  [[Gianbattista Tiepolo]], near the end of his long career produced some brilliant etchings, subjectless capricci of a landscape of classical ruins and pine trees, populated by an elegant band of beautiful young men and women, philosophers in fancy dress, soldiers and satyrs.  Bad-tempered owls look down on the scenes.  His son Domenico produced many more etchings in a similar style, but of much more conventional subjects, often reproducing his father's paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 576–584.&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical means at the disposal of reproductive printmakers continued to develop, and many superb and sought-after prints were produced by the English [[mezzotint]]ers (many of them in fact Irish) and by French printmakers in a variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths (1996), 134–158 on English mezzotints and their collectors.&lt;/ref&gt; French attempts to produce high quality colour prints were successful by the last part of the century, although the techniques were expensive.  Prints could now be produced that closely resembled [[drawing]]s in [[crayon]] or [[watercolour]]s. Some original prints were produced in these methods, but few major artists used them.&lt;ref&gt;Spangeberg, 221–222. Mayor, 591–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[novel]] led to a demand for small, highly expressive, illustrations for them.  Many fine French and other artists specialised in these, but clearly standing out from the pack is the work of [[Daniel Chodowiecki]], a German of Polish origin who produced over a thousand small etchings. Mainly illustrations for books, these are wonderfully drawn, and follow the spirit of the times, through the cult of sentiment to the revolutionary and [[nationalist]] fervour of the start of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 568, 591–600.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Goya War2.jpg|thumb|One of ''[[Los desastres de la guerra]]'', [[aquatint]] by [[Goya]]]]
[[Goya]]'s superb but violent [[aquatint]]s often look as though they are illustrating some unwritten work of fiction, but their meaning must be elucidated from their titles, often containing several meanings, and the brief comments recorded by him about many of them. His prints show from early on the macabre world that appears only in hints in the paintings until the last years.  They were nearly all published in several series, of which the most famous are: ''Caprichos'' (1799), ''[[Los desastres de la guerra]]'' (''The Disasters of War'' from after 1810, but unpublished for fifty years after). Rather too many further editions were published after his death, when his delicate aquatint tone had been worn down, or reworked.&lt;ref&gt;Bareau. Mayor, 624–631.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Blake]] was as technically unconventional as he was in subject-matter and everything else, pioneering a relief etching process that was later to become the dominant technique of commercial illustration for a time. Many of his prints are pages for his books, with text and image on the same plate, as in the 15th century block-books.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 608–611. Spangeberg, 262.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romantic Movement saw a revival in original printmaking in several countries, with Germany taking a large part once again; many of the [[Nazarene movement]] were printmakers.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths and Carey.&lt;/ref&gt; In England, [[John Sell Cotman]] etched many landscapes and buildings in an effective, straightforward style. [[J. M. W. Turner]] produced several print series including one, the ''[[Liber Studiorum]]'', which consisted of seventy-one etchings with mezzotint that were influential on landscape artists; according to Linda Hults, this series of prints amounts to "Turner's manual of landscape types, and&amp;nbsp;... a statement of his philosophy of landscape."&lt;ref&gt;Hults, 522.&lt;/ref&gt; With the relatively few etchings of [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] the period of the old master print can be said to come to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Spangeberg, 260–261&lt;/ref&gt; Printmaking was to revive powerfully later in the 19th and 20th centuries, in a great variety of techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Mayor, 660 onwards. Spangeberg, 263 onwards.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Tillemans''' ({{circa}} 1684 – 5 December 1734)&lt;ref name=noakes&gt;Noakes, Aubrey, ''Sportsmen in a Landscape'' (Ayer Publishing, 1971, {{ISBN|0-8369-2005-8}}), [https://books.google.com/books?id=tnEy0rkV0YEC&amp;pg=PA47 pp. 47–56: ''Peter Tillemans and Early Newmarket''] at books.google.com, accessed 7 February 2009. ONDB writes: "In 1733 Tillemans retired to Richmond, Surrey, and died on 5 December 1734 while staying at Little Haugh Hall. He was buried on 7 December at Stowlangtoft church, Suffolk." Tate.org gives his date of death as 19 November 1734.&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Flemish art|Flemish]]  [[painting|painter]], best known for his works on [[Hunting and shooting in the United Kingdom|sporting]] and [[landscape|topographical]] subjects. Alongside [[John Wootton]] and [[James Seymour]], he was one of the founders of the English school of sporting painting.

From 1708 until his death he lived and worked in England.

==Life==
[[File:John Michael Rysbrack, Bust of a Man, Probably Pieter Tillemans (1727, Yale Center for British Art).jpg|thumb|upright|A bust of a man believed to be Peter Tillemans, by [[John Michael Rysbrack]] (1727)]]

Tillemans was born in [[Antwerp]] in {{circa}} 1684, the son of a diamond-cutter, and studied painting there under various masters. As he was the brother-in-law of another Flemish painter, [[Pieter Casteels III|Pieter Casteels]], it is assumed that he married before leaving Antwerp. Like other artists from the [[Low Countries]] such as [[Dirk Maas]], [[Jan Wyck]] and [[Willem van de Velde the Younger]], Tillemans moved to England. In Tillemans's case he moved in 1708, induced to do so by a picture-dealer called Turner: he spent the rest of his life working there.&lt;ref name=odnb&gt;Bottoms, Edward, 'Tillemans, Peter (c.1684–1734), painter and draughtsman' in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (Oxford University Press, 2004). {{DNBfirst|wstitle=Tillemans, Peter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''Sportsmen in a Landscape'' (1971), Aubrey Noakes offers this description of Tillemans: {{quote|If we may judge from his success Tillemans was a socially agreeable and charming man. A portrait of him reveals that he was a gentle, friendly-looking fellow, with long curling hair, presumably his own and not a wig, such as was commonly worn by members of the upper and professional classes in the late eighteenth&lt;!--18th ot 17th?--&gt; century.&lt;ref name=noakes/&gt;}}

A chronic sufferer of [[asthma]], Tillemans retired to [[Richmond, London|Richmond]] "on account of his ill state of health".&lt;ref name="orleans"&gt;[http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/arts/orleans_house_gallery/orleans_house_gallery_collection_catalogue/places_in_the_orleans_house_gallery_collection/places_in_the_orleans_house_gallery_collection_18th_century.htm Orleans House Gallery Collection] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107171201/http://www.richmond.gov.uk/home/leisure_and_culture/arts/orleans_house_gallery/orleans_house_gallery_collection_catalogue/places_in_the_orleans_house_gallery_collection/places_in_the_orleans_house_gallery_collection_18th_century.htm |date=2009-01-07 }} Accessed 7 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  He died at the house of Dr [[Cox Macro]] (1683–1767, later chaplain to [[George II of Great Britain|George II]]) in Little Haugh Hall, in [[Suffolk]], on 5 December 1734 (the previous day he "had been busy on a horse portrait")&lt;ref name=noakes/&gt; and was buried on 7 December at [[Stowlangtoft]]. His collection of paintings had been sold in an auction conducted by Dr Macro on 19 and 20 April 1733 and included paintings by James Tillemans, probably a son or other relation, and by [[Arthur Devis (1712–1787)|Arthur Devis]], who, like [[Joseph Francis Nollekens]], was one of Tillemans's pupils.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/bryansdictionary02brya/bryansdictionary02brya_djvu.txt ''Bryan's Dictionary of Painters and Engravers''] Accessed 7 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Dr Macro had a bust of Tillemans made by [[John Michael Rysbrack]], placing it "in a niche at the top of a staircase in Little Haugh Hall".&lt;ref name=noakes/&gt; A portrait of the artist, engraved by T. Chambers, from a painting by Hissings, is given in [[Henry Fuseli|Fuseli]]'s 1805 revised edition of Rev. Matthew Pilkington's ''A Dictionary of Painters''.&lt;ref name=Gilbey&gt;Sir Walter Gilbey, ''Animal Painters of England From the Year 1650: A brief history of their lives and works'', vol. 2, London: Vintox &amp; Co., 1900, pp. 207–11.

==Painting==

===Early works===
Tillemans was brought to England in 1708 by "Turner, a picture dealer"; his first works were copies of battle scenes made for Turner, particularly of the works of [[Jacques Courtois]],&lt;ref name=Gilbey/&gt; as well as small genre pictures.&lt;ref name="tatebio"&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=552&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Peter Tillemans biography at Tate.org] Accessed 7 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He enjoyed much success imitating the style and execution of [[David Teniers the Younger|David Teniers]].&lt;ref name=Gilbey/&gt;
[[Image:Glen shiel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''The Battle of Glenshiel 1719'', 1719]]
Tillemans worked in many different styles and rarely dated his work. After at first working as a copyist, he quickly made his name, and among his first important commissions in England were two paintings of the interior of the [[Palace of Westminster]], one of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] in the [[House of Lords]] (1708–14), the other of the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in session (''c.'' 1710).&lt;ref name="orleans"/&gt; By 1711 Tillemans joined [[Godfrey Kneller]]'s Academy of Painting and Drawing in [[Great Queen Street]], [[London]], stating his speciality as "landskip".&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

His main residence was in [[Westminster]] but he travelled extensively on commission. Dr Cox Macro, his most faithful patron and the one for whom his work is best documented, gave him commissions, including battle and hunting scenes, landscapes, renovation work, and portraits from 1715.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name="tatebio"/&gt; In 1716 Tillemans repainted part of a portrait of Dr Macro by [[Frans van Mieris jr.|Frans van Mieris]] from around 1703, making alterations to his face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vads.ac.uk/large.php?pic=NWHCM_1991_1_38_F&amp;page=4&amp;mode=boolean&amp;words=cox&amp;idSearch=boolean&amp;vadscoll=Norwich+Castle+Museum+and+Art+Gallery Portrait of the Rev. Dr Cox Macro] vads.co.uk, accessed 16 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; That year he also painted Dr Macro in the background of ''The Artist's Studio'' (''c.'' 1716),  a self-portrait, with a pupil and Dr Cox Macro, surrounded in the studio by paintings.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; (He also painted Dr Macro's children in ''Master Edward and Miss Mary Macro'' in ''c.'' 1733). In 1717, his [[Conversation piece (paintings)|conversation piece]] of the royal family making music was shown at the Bartholomew fair.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; He was commissioned in 1719 by the antiquary [[John Bridges (topographer)|John Bridges]] to "make about 500 drawings for a projected history of Northamptonshire",&lt;ref name="tatebio"/&gt; and some of these were later published in [[Peter Whalley (clergyman)|Peter Whalley]]'s ''History and Antiquities of the County of Northamptonshire'' (1791).&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; His other patrons included the [[William Cavendish, 2nd Duke of Devonshire|Duke of Devonshire]], the 4th [[Baron Byron]] (to whom he was also drawing instructor),&lt;ref name=Gilbey/&gt; and the [[Evelyn Pierrepont, 1st Duke of Kingston-upon-Hull|Duke of Kingston]].&lt;ref name="orleans"/&gt;

His "highly accurate"&lt;ref name="GlenshielB"&gt;[http://www.artfund.org/artwork/2243/battle-of-glenshiel Provenance of ''The Battle of Glenshiel 1719''] Accessed 1 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; eponymous painting of the [[Battle of Glen Shiel]] in the [[Scottish National Portrait Gallery]], painted in the same year as the battle, was originally catalogued as [[Battle of Killiecrankie|''The Battle of Killiecrankie 1689'']].&lt;ref name="GlenshielB"/&gt;

===Sporting and topographical works===
The greater part of Tillemans's oeuvre was painted from approximately 1720 onwards,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Raines, "Peter Tillemans, Life and Work, with a List of Representative Paintings", ''Journal of the Walpole Society'', vol. XLVII, 1980, pp. 21–59, quoted at [http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ArtistWorks?cgroupid=999999961&amp;artistid=552&amp;page=1&amp;sole=y&amp;collab=y&amp;attr=y&amp;sort=default&amp;tabview=bio Peter Tillemans biography at Tate.org] Accessed 7 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and it is from the works painted over these years that he chiefly derives his fame. [[Image:Three Hounds with Horsemen'.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Three Hounds with Horsemen, a Hunt to the Left'']]During the early 1720s, Tillemans moved successfully into the field of painting dogs, horses and racing scenes and was one of the earliest painters of sporting scenes in England; four of these works, "engraved by Claude du Bosc and published in 1723, are among the most spectacular early sporting prints in England".&lt;ref name="tatebio"/&gt; 
[[Image:Horse with Groom and Hounds.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Horse with Groom and Hounds'', 1734. Tillemans was working on this unfinished painting on the day before he died.]]
The development of painting on sporting themes was centred on the [[Newmarket Racecourse]] in the market town of [[Newmarket, Suffolk|Newmarket]] in [[Suffolk]]. Together with his friend [[John Wootton]] (a pupil of Jan Wyck) and [[James Seymour]], Tillemans was one of the three founders of the English sporting school;&lt;ref name=Waterhouse&gt;Ellis Waterhouse, ''Painting in Britain, 1530 to 1790'', Baltimore, MD: Penguin, 1953, p. 215. At [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=202884 Questia.com] Accessed 13 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; their paintings "show the first marriage of the [[Topographical Tradition|topographical tradition]] of landscape with a sporting element".&lt;ref name=Waterhouse/&gt;  Because both Wootton and Tillemans omitted to sign many of their works, some of them are difficult to tell apart.&lt;ref name=Waterhouse/&gt; Tillemans's ''Newmarket: the Long Course'' (1723) is in the [[Government Art Collection]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt; Another Newmarket scene, ''The Newmarket Watering Course'' and a sporting scene, ''Three Hounds with Horsemen, a Hunt to the Left'', both in [[Norwich Castle|Norwich Castle Museum and Art Gallery]], were originally part of John Patteson's collection. Patteson had inherited many of Tillemans's paintings by his marriage into Dr Macro's family,&lt;ref name="artfund"/&gt; and these now form part of the Patteson Collection at Norwich Castle Museum. Tilleman painted numerous portraits of racehorses for his patrons, among whom were the Dukes of [[Duke of Somerset|Somerset]], [[Duke of Rutland|Rutland]], and [[Duke of Bolton|Bolton]], and the [[Earl of Portmore]].&lt;ref name=Gilbey/&gt;
[[Image:The Thames at Twickenham.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''The Thames at Twickenham'', 1725]]
According to [[Walter Gilbey|Sir Walter Gilbey]] in his ''Animal Painters of England From the Year 1650: A brief history of their lives and works'':
{{quote|The excellent plates engraved by Js. Sympson and Jn. Lloyds, from a set of three pictures descriptive of " Newmarket Horse Races," enable us to measure Tilleman's talent as a horse painter. Equine anatomy had not yet been mastered — had been hardly approached seriously — by artists when these pictures were painted, but the "different actions and postures," to quote from the inscription on the first of the series, are rendered with a skill that shows no inconsiderable advance in the art of horse portraiture.&lt;ref name=Gilbey/&gt;}}

In 1724, Tillemans worked with [[Joseph Goupy]] on scenery for the [[Opera House, Haymarket|Haymarket opera house]].&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;
[[Image:Foxhunting in Wooded Country.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Foxhunting in Wooded Country'', 1720–30]]
Tillemans was also a member of the [[Rose and Crown Club]], and in 1725 was recorded by [[George Vertue]] as steward to the Society of the Virtuosi of St Luke. Vertue noted that Tillemans was acquainted with "people of Fashion &amp; persons of Quality" and was in demand as a painter of country-house and estate views.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;&lt;ref name="tatebio"/&gt; 
[[Image:Chirk Castle from the North.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Chirk Castle from the North'', 1725]]
His [[country house]] paintings include [[Chatsworth House]] (1720s), [[Holker Hall]], and [[Chirk Castle]] in [[Denbighshire]] (1725). In such work the houses often stand in landscapes brought to life by animals and hunting scenes.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

Tillemans painted several topographical works of views in Richmond and [[Twickenham]], to the west of London, including ''A View of Richmond from Twickenham Park'' (later engraved by [[Peter Paul Benazech|P. Benazech]]),&lt;ref name=Gilbey/&gt; ''A View from Richmond Hill'' and ''The Thames at Twickenham'' (known also as ''A Prospect of Twickenham''). This last painting, the "earliest complete topographical view of the river frontage in the 18th century",&lt;ref name="orleans"/&gt; was commissioned either by the poet [[Alexander Pope]] (his villa by the [[River Thames|Thames]] is shown in the painting)&lt;ref name="twickers"&gt;[http://www.twickenham-museum.org.uk/detail.asp?ContentID=19 Twickenham-museum.org] Accessed 7 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or John Robartes, later 4th [[Earl of Radnor]].&lt;ref name="orleans"/&gt; His panorama of ''The Thames from Richmond Hill'' (''c.'' 1723) was one of three paintings done for the Earl of Radnor.&lt;ref name=odnb/&gt;

[[File:Antike Polychromie 1.jpg|thumb|Reconstructed color scheme of the [[entablature]] on a [[Doric temple]].]]
'''Polychrome''' is the "'practice of decorating architectural elements, sculpture, etc., in a variety of colors."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Cyril M., ed. ''Illustrated Dictionary of Historic Architecture'', Dover Publications, New York, c. 1977, 1983 edition&lt;/ref&gt;  The term is used to refer to certain [[styles of architecture]], [[pottery]] or sculpture in multiple colors. 

==Classical world==

{{further|Ancient Greek art#Polychromy}}
Some very early polychrome pottery has been excavated on [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] [[Crete]] such as at the [[Bronze Age]] site of [[Phaistos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://themodernantiquarian.com/site/10857/phaistos.html#fieldnotes C. Michael Hogan, ''Knossos Fieldnotes'', The Modern Antiquarian (2007)]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[ancient Greece]] sculptures were painted in strong colors. The paint was frequently limited to parts depicting clothing, hair, and so on, with the skin left in the natural color of the stone. But it could cover sculptures in their totality. The painting of Greek sculpture should not merely be seen as an enhancement of their sculpted form but has the characteristics of a distinct style of art. For example, the pedimental sculptures from the [[Temple of Aphaia]] on [[Aegina]] have recently{{when?|date=December 2012}} been demonstrated to have been painted with bold and elaborate patterns, depicting, amongst other details, patterned clothing. The polychrome of stone statues was paralleled by the use of materials to distinguish skin, clothing and other details in [[chryselephantine sculpture]]s, and by the use of metals to depict lips, nipples, etc., on high-quality bronzes like the [[Riace bronzes]].

An early example of polychrome decoration was found in the [[Parthenon]] atop the [[Acropolis of Athens]]. By the time European antiquarianism took off in the 18th century, however, the paint that had been on classical buildings had completely weathered off. Thus, the antiquarians' and architects' first impressions of these ruins were that classical beauty was expressed only through shape and composition, lacking in robust colors, and it was that impression which informed [[neoclassical architecture]]. However, some classicists such as [[Jacques Ignace Hittorff]] noticed traces of paint on classical architecture and this slowly came to be accepted. Such acceptance was later accelerated by observation of minute color traces by microscopic and other means, enabling less tentative reconstructions than Hittorff and his contemporaries had been able to produce. An example of classical Greek architectural polychrome may be seen in the full size [[Parthenon (Nashville)|replica of the Parthenon]] exhibited in [[Nashville, Tennessee]], US.

==Medieval world==
Throughout medieval Europe religious sculptures in wood and other media were often brightly painted or colored, as were the interiors of church buildings. These were often destroyed or whitewashed during [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]] phases of the [[Protestant Reformation]] or in other unrest such as the [[French Revolution]], though some have survived in museums such as the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A]], [[Musée de Cluny]] and [[Louvre]].

The exteriors of churches were painted as well, but little has survived. Exposure to the elements and changing tastes and religious approval over time acted against their preservation. The "Majesty Portal" of the [[Collegiate church of Toro]] is the most extensive remaining example, due to the construction of a chapel which enclosed and protected it from the elements just a century after it was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Melissa R. ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/767201 Architectural Polychromy and the Painters' Trade in Medieval Spain]''. Gesta. Vol. 41, No. 1, Artistic Identity in the Late Middle Ages (2002), pp. 3-14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baroque and Rococo periods==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
While stone and metal sculpture normally remained uncolored, like the classical survivals, polychromed wood sculptures were produced by Spanish artists: [[Juan Martínez Montañés]], [[Gregorio Fernández]] (17th century); German: [[Ignaz Günther]], [[Phillip Jacob Straub]] (18th century), or Brazilian: [[Aleijadinho]] (19th century).&lt;!---Gap - the following is rather US-centric - British Gothic revival was highly polychromatic, for example.---&gt;

With the arrival of European [[porcelain]] in the 18th century, brightly colored pottery figurines with a wide range of colors became very popular.

==19th century polychrome brickwork==
[[File:Rippon Lea.jpg|thumb|right|Rippon Lea Estate, in Australia has polychrome brickwork patterns.]]
{{main|Polychrome brickwork}}
Polychrome brickwork is a style of architectural brickwork which emerged in the 1860s and used bricks of different colors (typically brown, cream and red) in patterned combination to highlight architectural features. It was often used to replicate the effect of [[Quoin (architecture)|quoining]] and to decorate around windows. Early examples featured banding, with later examples exhibiting complex diagonal, criss-cross, and step patterns, in some cases even writing using bricks.

==20th century==
In the twentieth century there were notable periods of polychromy in architecture, from the expressions of Art Nouveau throughout Europe, to the international flourishing of Art Deco or Art Moderne, to the development of postmodernism in the latter decades of the century. During these periods, brickwork, stone, tile, stucco and metal facades were designed with a focus on the use of new colors and patterns, while architects often looked for inspiration to historical examples ranging from Islamic tilework to English Victorian brick. In the 1970s and 1980s, especially, architects working with bold colors included [[Robert Venturi]] ([[Allen Memorial Art Museum]] addition; Best Company Warehouse), [[Michael Graves]] ([[Snyderman House]]; Humana Building), and [[James Stirling (architect)|James Stirling]] (Neue Staatsgalerie; [[Arthur M. Sackler Museum]]), among others.

===United States===
[[File:Kendallville-indiana-architectural-detail.jpg|thumb|300px|Polychrome Victorian-era architectural detail in [[Kendallville, Indiana]].]]
Polychrome building facades later rose in popularity as a way of highlighting certain trim features in Victorian and [[Queen Anne Style architecture|Queen Anne]] [[architecture]] in the [[United States]]. The rise of the modern paint industry following the [[American Civil War]] also helped to fuel the (sometimes extravagant) use of multiple colors.

The polychrome facade style faded with the rise of the 20th century's revival movements, which stressed classical colors applied in restrained fashion and, more importantly, with the birth of modernism, which advocated clean, unornamented facades rendered in white stucco or paint. Polychromy reappeared with the flourishing of the preservation movement and its embrace of (what had previously been seen as) the excesses of the Victorian era and in [[San Francisco, California]] in the 1970s to describe its abundant late-nineteenth-century houses. These earned the endearment '[[Painted Ladies]]', a term that in modern times is considered [[kitsch]] when it is applied to describe all Victorian houses that have been painted with period colors.

[[John Joseph Earley]] (1881–1945) developed a "polychrome" process of concrete slab construction and ornamentation that was admired across America. In the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area, his products graced a variety of buildings &amp;mdash; all formed by the staff of the Earley Studio in [[Rosslyn, Virginia]]. Earley's [[Polychrome Historic District]] houses in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] were built in the mid-1930s. The concrete panels were pre-cast with colorful stones and shipped to the lot for on-site assembly. Earley wanted to develop a higher standard of affordable housing after the Depression, but only a handful of the houses were built before he died; written records of his concrete casting techniques were destroyed in a fire. Less well-known, but just as impressive, is the Dr. Fealy Polychrome House that Earley built atop a hill in Southeast Washington, D.C. overlooking the city. His uniquely designed polychrome houses were outstanding among prefabricated houses in the country, appreciated for their Art Deco ornament and superb craftsmanship.

==Polychromatic light==
The term '''polychromatic''' means having several colors. It is used to describe [[light]] that exhibits more than one [[color]], which also means that it contains radiation of more than one [[wavelength]]. The study of polychromatics is particularly useful in the production of [[diffraction grating]]s.

'''''Presentation of Christ in the Temple''''' is a small 1445 painting by the German artist [[Stefan Lochner]], now in the [[Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation|Gulbenkian Foundation]], Lisbon. It was once the wing of a [[diptych]], the opposite, now separated, panel was a   depiction of the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]. Its reverse shows the Stigmatisation of St. Francis.&lt;ref name="c267"&gt;Chapuis, 267&lt;/ref&gt; The panel is dedicated to [[Catherine of Alexandria|St. Catherine]] and shows the [[Presentation of Jesus at the Temple|purification of the Virgin]]. It is the first of two of Lochner's treatments of the subject - a larger painting completed two years later is kept at the [[Hessisches Landesmuseum]], [[Darmstadt]], Germany. The two panels are the only known dated paintings left by Lochner.&lt;ref name="w4"&gt;Wellesz, 4&lt;/ref&gt; 

The work seems derived from and influenced by Flemish art; similarity can be seen in the facial type given to [[Simeon]], as well as certain elements of the architecture.&lt;ref name="w4" /&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Stefan Lochner - Presentation of Christ in the Temple - WGA13347.jpg|left|thumb|260px|''Presentation of Christ in the Temple'', 1447]]
The painting is in the late [[International Gothic]] style. It is rather static and sculptural, with any action limited to the main characters positioned in the center of the panel. The scene is set within a domed [[apse]]-like building, as an altarpiece takes center stage it is presumably a church. [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|The Virgin]] stands to the left, to her right is [[Anna the Prophetess]] and behind her, only partially visible is [[St. Joseph]], who holds the sacrificial doves. Simeon is dressed in green and appears quite regal, although he appears to be crying, perhalps because he knows the tragedy that awaits Christ in later life.&lt;ref&gt;Kenney, 88&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the Christ child, the stained glass behind them shows a representation of [[Moses]] holding the [[Tablets of Stone]].&lt;ref name="w5"&gt;Wellesz, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The later version is more expansive, contains many more characters, and delves into the later stages of the biblical story.&lt;ref name="w5"&gt;Wellesz, 5&lt;/ref&gt; Reflectology indicate there was very little preparatory underdrawing undertaken before the final paint was applied. The panel is in very good condition, and has suffered only minor paint loss. The exterior painting is less well preserved, with scratchings and paint losses on important passages. It is painted on a single board of oak, with a vertical [[Wood grain|grain]].&lt;ref name="c267" /&gt; 

Although the painting is quite flat, perspective is achieved through the subtle fall of light which creates distance between the rear wall and framing arch. Other methods of depicting recession include the relative sizes of the floor tiles, and the overlapping of figures.&lt;ref name="c21"&gt;Chapuis, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Punishment of the Sons of Corah''''' or '''''Punishment of the Rebels''''' is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter [[Sandro Botticelli]], executed in 1480–1482 in the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Rome]].

==History==
On 27 October 1480 Botticelli, together with other Florentine painters, left for Rome, where he had been called as part of the reconciliation project between [[Lorenzo de' Medici]], the ''de facto'' ruler of [[Republic of Florence|Florence]], and [[Pope Sixtus IV]]. The Florentines started to work in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as early as the Spring of 1481, along with [[Pietro Perugino]], who was already there.

The theme of the decoration was a parallel between the Stories of Moses and those of Christ, as a sign of continuity between the [[Old Testament|Old]] and the [[New Testament]]. A continuity also between the divine law of the Tables and the message of Jesus, who, in turn, chose Peter (the first bishop of Rome) as his successor: this would finally result in  a legitimation of the latter's successors, the popes of Rome.

Botticelli, helped by numerous assistants, painted three scenes. On 17 February 1482 his contract was renovated, including the other scenes to complete the chapel's decoration. However, on the 20th of the same month, his father died: he returned to Florence, where he remained.

==Description==
The painting depicts three episodes and tells of a rebellion by the [[Israelites]] against [[Moses]] and [[Aaron]]. On the right the rebels attempt to stone Moses after becoming disenchanted by their trials on their emigration from Egypt. [[Joshua]] has placed himself between the rebels and Moses, protecting him from the stoning. The center scene shows the rebellion with [[Korah#Korah, son of Izhar, leader of a rebellion against Moses|Korah]] and the conspirators being driven out by Moses and Aaron, as high priest wearing the papal diadem. To the left, the ground opens and the two principal conspirators sink into it. The children of Korah are spared the fate of their father.

The intended message of the painting is clear, no one should doubt the authority of the [[Pope]] over the Church. The power of the papacy was constantly being questioned at the time.

A '''secret history''' (or '''shadow history''') is a [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] interpretation of either fictional or real [[history]] which is claimed to have been deliberately suppressed, forgotten, or ignored by established scholars. "Secret history" is also used to describe an alternative interpretation of documented facts which portrays a drastically different motivation or history from established historical events.

==Secret histories of the real world==
{{main article|Historical revisionism}}
Originally, secret histories were designed as non-fictional, revealing or claiming to reveal the truth behind the "[[Spin (public relations)|spin]]": one such example is ''[[The Secret History of the Mongols]]''. Secret histories can range from standard [[historical revisionism]] with proper critical reexamination of historical facts to [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|negative historical revisionism]] wherein facts are deliberately omitted, [[suppression of dissent|suppressed]] or distorted.

The quintessential example secret history is the ''[[Procopius#Secret History|Anecdota]]'' of [[Procopius of Caesarea]] (known for centuries as the ''Secret History''). It was discovered, centuries after it was written, in the [[Vatican Library]] and published in 1623, although its existence was already known from the ''[[Suda]]'', which referred to it as the ''Anekdota'' ("the unpublished composition"). The ''Secret History'' covers roughly the same years as the first seven books of the ''History of Justinian's Wars'' and appears to have been written after they were published. Current consensus generally dates it to 550 or 558, possibly as late as 562. It portrays the reign of the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Justinian I]] to the great disadvantage of the Emperor, the Emperor's wife, and some of his imperial court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Procopius/Anecdota/home.html The Secret History], English translation (Dewing, 1935) at [[LacusCurtius]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional secret histories==
Secret history is sometimes used in a long-running [[science fiction]] or [[fantasy]] universe to preserve [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] with the present by reconciling [[paranormal]], [[anachronistic]], or otherwise notable but unrecorded events with what actually happened in known history; for instance, in the ''[[Star Trek]]'' universe, [[Greg Cox (writer)|Greg Cox]]'s novels ''[[The Eugenics Wars: The Rise and Fall of Khan Noonien Singh]]'' cast the devastating [[Eugenics Wars]] of the 1990s (still well into the future when first mentioned in an episode from 1967) as shadow wars most people never knew about, in which such real-life events from that era as the [[Smiling Buddha]] nuclear test, the [[Yugoslav Wars]] during the 1990s, and the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] were all part of one wider conflict.

===Secret history thrillers===
A certain type of [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] can be defined as secret history. In such novels, a daring spy, assassin or commando ''nearly'' carries out a coup which would have drastically changed history as we know it. Since this is not [[alternate history]] but a secret event in our own history, the reader knows in advance that this attempt would be foiled, that all persons in the know would be sworn to secrecy and all evidence be consigned to a top secret archive, where supposedly it still is. Nevertheless, the plot fascinates many readers who want to see how close history comes to being changed (usually very, very close) and exactly how the attempt would be foiled.

Two highly successful novels are considered to have started this subgenre:

* ''[[Eye of the Needle (novel)|Eye of the Needle]]'' by [[Ken Follett]]: a German spy in 1944 nearly succeeds in foiling [[D-Day]];
* ''[[The Day of the Jackal]]'' by [[Frederick Forsyth]]: an assassin nearly succeeds in killing [[Charles De Gaulle]], president of France, in 1963.

These two novels set the framework for many later books: following step by step both the fiendishly clever, competent and ruthless perpetrator in carrying out his design and the equally clever and competent hunter, hot on his heels throughout the book, but who would catch up with him only at the very end. Typically, historical figures – including very famous ones – appear in some key scenes, but are not major actors.

Many other novels of this type followed, most of them with [[World War II]] backgrounds. Follet himself published at least two others:
* ''[[The Key to Rebecca]]'': a German spy in [[Cairo]] nearly succeeds in letting [[Erwin Rommel]] win at [[El Alamein]].
* ''[[The Man from St. Petersburg]]'': a [[Russian anarchist]] in 1914 Britain nearly succeeds, by assassinating a key envoy of the Tsar, in averting the [[First World War]].

Works of other writers fitting within this type include:
* ''[[Enigma (novel)|Enigma]]'' by [[Robert Harris (novelist)|Robert Harris]]: an embittered code-breaker nearly betrays to Nazi Germany the vital and closely guarded secret that the Allies are able to read its secret messages.
* ''[[The Eagle Has Landed (novel)|The Eagle Has Landed]]'' by [[Jack Higgins]]: German commandos nearly succeed in kidnapping British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] out of wartime England.
* ''[[The Romanov Succession]]'' by [[Brian Garfield]]: taking advantage of the 1941 Nazi attack on the Soviet Union, [[Russia]]n exiles attempt to assassinate Soviet premier [[Joseph Stalin]] and restore the monarchy.
* ''[[The Night Letter]]'' by [[Paul Spike]]: In 1940, Nazi agents nearly succeed in blackmailing U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] into not running for a third term.
* ''[[The Ninth Man]]'' by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: a few years later, a Nazi agent penetrates the White House and nearly succeeds in assassinating Roosevelt.
* ''[[Stalag Texas]]'', also by [[John Lee (author)|John Lee]]: escaped German prisoners nearly succeed in destroying the American nuclear laboratory at [[Los Alamos, New Mexico|Los Alamos]].
* ''An Exchange of Eagles'' by [[Owen Sela]]: In 1940, senior officers of the German [[Abwehr]] and the [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army) |American Military Intelligence]] make a secret deal to simultaneously assassinate [[Adolf Hitler]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] with the assumption that they would be replaced by [[Hermann Göring]] and [[Henry A. Wallace]] - who would make peace and prevent World War II from further escalating.
* In the 2006 [[historical detective]] novel, ''[[The Janissary Tree]]'' by [[Jason Goodwin]], a power-mad [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] general in 1836 nearly succeeds in overthrowing Sultan [[Mehmet II]] and proclaiming a republic almost 90 years in advance of [[Ataturk]].
* In the thriller ''[[The Redbreast]]'' by [[Jo Nesbø]], a former World War II Norwegian collaborator with the Nazi occupation nearly succeeds in assassinating the Norwegian Crown Prince.

Different types of secret history thriller include:

* ''[[The Leader and the Damned]]'' by [[Colin Forbes (novelist)|Colin Forbes]]: [[Adolf Hitler]] was assassinated in 1943 but his death was kept secret and the man who led Nazi Germany in the last two years of the war was a [[Look-alike|double]]. This book also provides a detailed view on the role of [[Martin Bormann]] in the Nazi leadership and of his eventual fate, completely at odds with the official historical record. 
* ''[[XPD]]'' by [[Len Deighton]]: [[Winston Churchill]] was far more of an [[appeaser]] than official history records, and in June 1940 he had a secret meeting with Hitler to discuss peace on the basis of recognizing the German domination of Europe; decades later, the documents recording this shameful secret are the subject of an intensive and deadly power struggle.
* The mystery series by [[Elliott Roosevelt]] in which his mother, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], is the detective – placing murder mysteries in the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] White House and other actual locations and involving many historical persons in the fictional events depicted. In one book of the series, ''[[Murder at the Chateau]]'', Eleanor Roosevelt is involved not only in a murder mystery but also in a high-level secret conference in Occupied France, which nearly ends with a diplomatic deal to end World War II in 1941.
* ''[[The Berkut]]'' by Joseph Heywood. [[Adolf Hitler]] did not really commit suicide in 1945, it was a double who died together with [[Eva Braun]]. The real Hitler tried to escape from Berlin, was captured by Soviet commandos after the long chase making most of the book, and was secretly kept under horrible and degrading conditions in the [[Kremlin]] basement until the death of [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1953, when he was secretly executed.
* Many of the "Blackford Oakes" spy novels, by conservative writer William F. Buckley, Jr., which are secret-history thrillers claiming that historical events considered to have been setbacks for the United States were actually brilliant strategic coups by the CIA which were merely allowed to look like defeats for security purposes, or at least were the product of the US's moral superiority. For instance, in ''[[Who's on First (novel)|Who's on First]]'', Oakes deliberately chooses not to stop the Soviet Union from launching [[Sputnik]] ahead of the otherwise-superior US satellite program, in order to protect the life of a Soviet contact (and thus the seeming Soviet technological triumph was actually authorized by a US agent, who allowed it to happen); in ''[[Marco Polo, if You Can]]'', Oakes is the real-life [[U2]] pilot [[Gary Powers]], and allows himself to be captured while flying over the Soviet Union in order to create a cover story for a secret US intelligence operation (and thus the [[U2 incident]] was actually planned from the start, [[Gary Powers]] was not shot down by the Soviet military but deliberately set up his own capture, and U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]'s subsequent humiliation by Soviet Premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] never happened).
* The plot of [[Clive Cussler]]'s ''[[Night Probe!]]'' is based on the assumption that on the eve of [[World War I]] in 1914, a secret treaty was signed between the British Prime Minister, [[H. H. Asquith]], with the cooperation of [[George V of the United Kingdom|King George V]], and US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] – to sell [[Canada]] to the United States for the sum of one billion dollars. The treaty was aborted at the time and reference to it erased from all official records – to resurface explosively in 1989 (as future date at the time of writing).
* An interesting example of a science-fiction secret history novel can be found in the [[BBC]] ''[[Doctor Who]]'' [[Past Doctor Adventures]] novel ''[[Imperial Moon]]'', which sees the [[Fifth Doctor]] and his companions [[Vislor Turlough]] and [[Kamelion]] learn about a secret trip to the Moon by the British Imperial Spacefleet in 1878. On first hearing of the expedition, the Doctor notes that Victorian science could have built a structurally sound spaceship capable of going to the Moon, with the only thing beyond them being a conventional propulsion system; the events of the novel reveal that information about how to create the ships' engines was secretly provided by an alien race trapped on the Moon who sought to escape to Earth. At the novel's conclusion, after the alien race decimates the spaceport where the ships returned to Earth before being defeated by the Doctor and his companions, the Doctor arranges for Queen Victoria to cancel the space program as he recognises that Victorian Britain is not psychologically ready to travel in space, with all records of the expedition being destroyed apart from the expedition leader's diary, which he entrusts to the Doctor for safe keeping.
* Another example of a science-fiction secret history is ''[[The Proteus Operation]]'' by [[James P. Hogan (writer)|James P. Hogan]]. Its plot tells the most closely guarded secret of [[World War II]]: in 1939 there arrived in New York City a group of time-travelers from a future timeline in which the Nazis won the war and took over most of the world. The arrivals secretly contacted [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] and provided invaluable  information about how the Germans won in their history – which enabled the Allies to do better this time and win the war. This time-travel secret was only known to  Roosevelt and Churchill, to a few of their close advisers such as [[Harry Hopkins]], and to a few scientists such as [[Einstein]]. After the victory in 1945, all who knew it were sworn to secrecy – and strictly kept it until their deaths – and all records destroyed, this secret considered too explosive to be ever told.
* [[James A. Hetley]]'s [[Contemporary Fantasy]] books ''Dragon's Eye'' and ''Dragon's Teeth'' are based on the assumption that in the Fourteenth Century several boatloads of rebellious [[Welsh people|Welsh]], opposing the [[Wales in the Late Middle Ages| English conquest of their homeland]], secretly crossed the Atlantic and established themselves at what would become the State of [[Maine]]. Being not very numerous and not the harbingers of further immigrants, they were able to reach a reasonable accommodation with the matrilineal leadership of the local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] tribe. Centuries later they blended with later European immigrants, stating truthfully that their name was Morgan and that they were of Welsh origin, while being vague on when they had come to America. In the 17th and 18th Century they were involved in piracy, later shifted to other lucrative (and highly illegal) activities. By the present time, the Welsh Morgans along with the Native American Haskells are still the two leading families of Stonefort, Maine. In their well-guarded home are preserved various artifacts of their ancestors, and manuscripts in Medieval Latin and Welsh  - which historians would have loved to see, but the Morgans prefer not to share them with outsiders.

===Fictional "secret" versions of historical events===
* [[Alexandre Dumas, père|Alexandre Dumas]]' last major work, ''[[The Knight of Sainte-Hermine]]'' asserts that it was the novel's protagonist who killed the British Admiral [[Horatio Nelson]] and that the true circumstances of Nelson's death were kept secret for reasons which form part of the book's plot. 
* Dumas' earlier and more well-known work, ''[[The Three Musketeers]]'', provides a detailed and entirely fictional account of the background to the 1628 assassination of [[George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham]] by the junior officer [[John Felton (assassin)#In fiction| John Felton]]. At the time and up to the present, Felton's act was considered as part of the turbulent 17th Century English politics. As depicted by Dumas, however, the assassination of Buckingham was the result of a convoluted plot hatched by the French [[Cardinal Richelieu]], while Felton himself was unaware of being manipulated by Richelieu's female agent. 
* [[Elizabeth Bear]]'s "Promethean Age" series constitutes a massive secret history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Monette|first=Sarah|title=An Interview with Elizabeth Bear, conducted by Sarah Monette|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22&amp;hl=en&amp;btnG=Google+Search&amp;sourceid=Mozilla-search&amp;start=0#hl=en&amp;sugexp=les%3B&amp;gs_nf=1&amp;tok=fGCbg3M4XX5PLux3JCZiJA&amp;pq=elizabeth%20bear%27s%20%22promethean%20age%22%20%22secret%20history%22%20review&amp;cp=51&amp;gs_id=iw&amp;xhr=t&amp;q=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22&amp;pf=p&amp;safe=off&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;oq=Elizabeth+Bear%27s+%22Promethean+Age%22+%22secret+history%22+&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;fp=22adff2dc2288598&amp;biw=840&amp;bih=359&amp;bs=1|publisher=Subterranean Press|accessdate=4 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Elizabethan]] England, with considerable [[fantasy]] elements. Among other things the series asserts that [[Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford]] was a secret illegitimate son of [[Queen Elizabeth I]]; that Sir [[Francis Walsingham]], the Queen's spymaster, did not die in 1590 as history records but lived in secret for another five years; that playwrights [[Christopher Marlowe]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Ben Jonson]] were all secret agents of the Queen and underwent dangerous missions in her service, in addition to their theatrical activities; that the plays of all three had profound secret political and magical meanings; that Shakespeare and Marlowe were lovers, and homoerotic elements in [[Shakespeare's Sonnets]] were dedicated to Marlowe; that [[Edmund Spencer]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' was not a fictional work but was based on a true Kingdom of Faerie, whose Queen had a secret pact of mutual help with the English Queen Elizabeth; that Christopher Marlowe was not assassinated in 1593 as history records but was taken into Faerie where he became the lover of the witch [[Morgan le Fay]]; and that Shakespeare had also visited Faerie and personally met with [[Puck (A Midsummer Night's Dream)|Puck]] and other supposedly legendary characters depicted in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''.
* The [[The Black Adder|first series]] of ''[[Blackadder]]'', in which [[Henry VII of England]] comes to power in a completely different way and removes the reign of "Richard IV" from the history books.  Note that in recorded history England had only three kings named Richard.
*The ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' video game franchise is built around a conspiracy-laden story involving a "[[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]]" organization that originated with the [[Knights Templar]]. According to the game's fiction, many historical figures were secretly Templars, manipulating history and those around them in a quest for power. They were opposed by the Assassins, another secret order that considered themselves defenders of humanity's free will. It is implied, and confirmed in ''[[Assassin's Creed II]]'', that certain powerful artifacts that the Templars sought in their quest for power were remnants of a secret "First Civilization", the basis for most real-world religion and mythology. The true history of the world has long been lost and/or intentionally obscured, possibly by the Templars.
* The background of [[Ben Aaronovitch]]'s ''[[Rivers of London (novel)|Rivers of London]]'' series of [[contemporary fantasy]] detective thrillers includes the assertion that [[Isaac Newton]], in addition to his well-known scientific achievements, was also a powerful [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] who codified the basic principles of [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Unlike Newton's writings on other subjects, his ''Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Artes Magicis'' ([[Latin]] for "Natural Philosophy Principles of The Magical Arts") was never made known to the general public. However, copies of Newton's book, as of other books on magic, were kept at a secret section of the [[Bodleian Library]] in the [[University of Oxford]], and it remained the basic text for practitioners of magic into the twenty-first century. The same series also assumes that, in addition to the various weapons deployed, [[World War II]] had also been fought by magical means, with [[Nazi Germany]], [[Military history of the United Kingdom during World War II|Britain]], the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]] each raising its own secret corps of warrior-wizards. Specifically, official World War II histories omit all mention of a major battle fought on January 1945 at Ettersberg, Germany – where thousands of British wizards gave their lives in the effort to destroy a secret magical facility, from where Nazi wizards were seeking to unleash [[vampire]]s and other nasty magical surprises upon the world. Scattered in the series are minor other tidbits of secret history: The practice of magic flourished among the court ladies of [[Caroline of Ansbach]]; during the [[War of 1812]] British wizards trained [[Tecumseh]]'s [[medicine men]] in up to date Newtonian magic, for which American wizards kept a grudge even centuries later; [[Maynard Keynes]], though not practicing magic himself, was associated with the British wizards and helped them locate various magical manuscripts; in 2009, American wizards trying a magical operation as part of the [[Iraq War]] suffered a major fiasco at [[Falluja]] which was covered up but got their contract with the US Army terminated.  
* [[Umberto Eco]]'s novel ''[[Baudolino]]'' suggests that Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I]], who died while on the [[Second Crusade]], had not drowned in a river, as history records. Rather, he had died mysteriously at night while hosted at the castle of a sinister Armenian noble. According to the book, the only people who knew the truth had an excellent reason to hide it - since they had been in charge of guarding the Emperor, and if the truth became known they might have been executed out of hand for failing in their task.
* Gore Vidal's novel "Creation", purporting to disclose many facts on Greek-Persian Wars that were not known to Herodotus, asserts that the Persian King Darius planned a major military campaign in India, with the aim of annexing the entire Gangetic Plain to the Persian Empire. But the Greeks, entagling the Persians in a major war on their other flank and proving a tougher opponent than the Persian counted on, caused that Indian campaign to be aborted.  Thus, according to Vidal, the Greeks unknowingly greatly influenced India's history and - since this was the Buddha's lifetime - also the character of Buddhism, a major world religion.

* The books of [[Steve Berry (novelist)|Steve Berry]] often have secret history elements which are critical to their plots. For example, ''The Jefferson Key'', part of Berry's [[Cotton Malone]] series, is based on the assumption that all four assassinations of a US President ([[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1865, [[James A. Garfield]] in 1881,[[William McKinley]] in 1901 and [[John Kennedy]] in 1963) were in fact organized by a secret "Commonwealth" of pirates (or "privateers"), founded during the American Revolution, which still exists into the 21st Century and wields considerable power behind the scenes, and whose lucrative activities were in one way or another disrupted by each of these four Presidents. The pirates had, in each case, located a person who had a reason to hate the President and manipulated him into unknowingly carrying out their design. Other Presidents, like [[Woodrow Wilson]] during WWI and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] in WWII, knew of this Commonwealth, recognized its secret role and made secret use of it - and thus avoided being assassinated. The book's plot hinges on a page torn from the Congressional Record, confirming that Congress in the early years of the US did give  this Commonwealth "a perpetual authorization" to act as [[privateer]]s. Once the current President's agent has located and destroyed this document, ensuring that this piece of secret history will remain forever secret, the President is free to act decisively and break up the pirate Commonwealth. Other Steve Berry books feature such pieces of secret history as Treasure hidden by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], secret survivals of the [[Knights Templar]] and the fate of the books of the [[Alexandrine Library]].

==Secret histories of fictional worlds==
"[[Retcon]]", alteration of the [[Canon (fiction)|canonical]] account of past events in serial fiction, often employs aspects of secret history. A seeming [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]] breach might be "revealed" to alter the truth of what readers were previously led to believe was a definitive story. A retcon might equally well convert an established history into a secret history. Such transformations occur with particular frequency in long-running [[superhero]] comic books.

===Examples===
* When [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] wrote ''[[The Final Problem]]'' he fully intended to kill off [[Sherlock Holmes]] and write no further books and stories about him. Faced with massive pressure and protests by the famous detective's fans, he finally gave in. "[[The Adventure of the Empty House]]" revealed that Holmes did not die after all, and recounted a secret history of three years in which Holmes had been wandering the world while everybody – including even his close friend Dr. Watson – believed him to be dead. What differentiates this case from many other retcons and reboots is the fact that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did not need to alter the initial stories in any ways, since he had never given any substantial evidence that Sherlock Holmes died, in the first place : the "death" of the Great Detective was only a mistake on the part of the police and Dr Watson who misread the signs on the place of his apparent death.
* The ''[[Doctor Who]]'' serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'' also alludes to hidden ''fictional'' history, establishing that during the events of the serial ''[[An Unearthly Child]]'', the [[First Doctor]] had in his possession a super-weapon, the [[Hand of Omega]] stolen from his own people, the [[Time Lord]]s. The story also implies that he knew of the [[Daleks]] before he "first" met them.
* [[DC Comics]]' ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' made years of "established" events and characters from the [[DC Universe]] (for example the existence of [[Krypto]]) "un-happen". In the revised continuity only a few privileged characters remember the old continuity, making it "secret".
* [[Philip Jose Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family|Wold Newton]] universe heavily influenced Alan Moore's subsequent ''[[League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]''. Both these universes tie together many disparate fictional creations in a variety of surprising ways.
* [[Warren Ellis]]'s comic book series ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'' offers a secret history look at the origin of comic book and literary type superheroes.
* [[Philip José Farmer]]'s ''[[The Other Log of Phileas Fogg]]'' reinterprets [[Jules Verne]]'s famous tale with the assumption that in fact Fogg was the immortal foster child of a race of hominid aliens known as the Eridani, and that his travel around the world was part of a secret mission on their behalf.
* Many of the novels by American [[Tim Powers]] are secret histories. For example, his 1987 novel ''[[On Stranger Tides]]'' had a different interpretation of pirate [[Blackbeard]]'s death at Ocracoke Inlet. After finding the [[Fountain of Youth]], Blackbeard planned to go in battle and knew it would lead to his death, which he wanted to be a widely known event. After Blackbeard's death, his head was severed and hung on the bowsprit, in which the pirate's blood fell into the sea, thereby letting the effects of the Fountain work. Blackbeard's soul would gain a new body, where he would assume a new identity as "Edmund Morcilla" until he was killed again, for once and all, by the book's protagonist, Jack Shandy. Powers's 2001 novel ''[[Declare]]'' presents a secret history of the Cold War, with America and the U.K. jousting with the Soviet Union over the control of powerful supernatural forces.

==Time travel secret histories==

The plots of some [[Time travel]] books and stories make it possible to count them as secret histories as well – since they posit that the truth about various historical figures and events is quite different from what history books recount.

For example, [[Poul Anderson]]'s story "Brave to be a King" asserts that King [[Cyrus the Great]], founder of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], was in fact a twentieth-century American time traveler stranded in the past who became a King by strange circumstances. (However, this is "cancelled out" at the end of the story, when the real Cyrus is restored to the timeline, and the American goes home to his own century.) Another Anderson story, "The Sorrow of Odin the Goth", asserts that also the Nordic god [[Odin]]/[[Wodan]] was a twentieth-century American time traveler, who sought to study the culture of the ancient [[Goths]] and ended up being regarded as a god and starting an enduring myth. 

[[Paul Levinson]]'s "[[The Plot to Save Socrates]]" asserts (as its title suggests), that the philosopher [[Socrates]] did not drink hemlock, as history tells. Rather, a clone died in his place and the true Socrates lived some more years in Twenty First Century America. Also according to the same book, the politician and general [[Alcibiades]] had a long life and many adventures after the moment when history records his death; Alcibiades' mistress Timandra and the famous  fourth-century  mathematician [[Hypatia]] of [[History of Alexandria#Late Roman and Byzantine period|Alexandria]] were one and the same person, a time-traveling American woman; the inventor [[Hero of Alexandria]] was also an American time traveler; and finally, according to the same book, the  nineteenth-century publisher [[William Henry Appleton]] had an extensive secret life as a time traveler, had visited [[Classical Greece]] and met some of the famous ancient Greek writers and philosophers whose works he published, and also several times visited the twenty-first century – but always found his own nineteenth-century milieu to be the most congenial.

According to [[David Drake]]'s novel "[[Birds of Prey (Drake novel)|Birds of Prey]]", the [[Roman Empire]]'s [[Third Century Crisis]] was far more severe than modern historians realize, and the Empire was on the verge of final collapse and disintegration already then. The situation was saved by a time traveler from the very far future, endowed with telepathic and other superhuman powers. That traveler encountered a young junior Roman officer named [[Diocletian]], realized his enormous potential and gave him the final push to eventually become a strong Emperor, revive and restructure the Roman Empire and give it another two hundred years of life (and much longer for its Eastern portion). Diocletian himself was completely unaware of this crucial help to his career.

[[Ray Nelson]]'s novel ''Bĺake's Progress'' assumes that the poet [[William Blake]] and his wife [[Catherine Blake| Kate]] were accomplished time travelers who had many adventures in past and future times and in various [[alternate timeline]]s, their actions profoundly effecting the course of human history. They had a child never known to recorded history, since the child - also a time traveler - was born in the distant past and lived out his life in the distant future. While it is well-known that Blake revered the poetry of [[John Milton]], the book discloses that the two of them often met personally - the century separating them being no hindrance since Milton, too, was a time traveler and both could travel freely over millions of years. [[William Blake's mythology]] is not fictional but features actual people - or beings - whom  Blake met on his wanderings through time. The character [[Urizen]] was in fact Blake's own son, born of a relationship with a woman of the far future. In addition to all the above, the book makes the more mundane assertion that many of the engravings attributed to Blake were in fact made by Kate and that in fact she was the better engraver of the two.

'''Shapurgala''' ({{lang-az|'''Şapurqala'''}}) is a fortress located on the left bank of Nakhchivanay, near the village with the same name in [[Shahbuz District]] of [[Nakhchivan Autonomous Republic]].

==Research==
The fortress is located on a high mountain, surrounded by steep cliffs. It was registered as an archeological monument in 1990. The area of the fortress is 1,300 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. There is a [[Pir (Zoroastrianism)|Pir]] on the road to the fortress. In the area above the Pir, remains of a destroyed construction and pink colored clay dish fragments were encountered.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"/&gt;

In the central part of the fortress researchers came across construction remnants, baked bricks, pink clay plates and remains of grain stones and fireplaces.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"/&gt; The findings indicate that life in Shapurgala lasted from the first century AD to the XV-XVI centuries.&lt;ref name="haqqinda"&gt;{{cite web|title= SHapurqala|url= https://haqqinda.az/Azərbaycan+qalalarının+siyahısı/41295-SHapurqala.html|publisher= haqqinda.az|language= az|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also used as a guard station for defensive purposes.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"/&gt;

==Architectural features==
The fortress is located in a polygonal-shaped area. The tallest place of the pitch is the tallest cliff in the south-east. Inside the cliff a rectangular room is drilled with 4x3.6 m of area. The burnt bricks of the size of 19x19x5 cm were found inside the room, a rhomb shaped niche was made on the wall of the fortress, and the wall under the niche was made in semi-circular form.&lt;ref name="shahbuz"&gt;Ə.

'''''The Avenue in the Rain''''' is a 1917 oil painting by the American [[Impressionist]] painter [[Childe Hassam]]. It depicts [[Fifth Avenue]] in New York City in the rain, draped with [[US flag]]s. The painting is one of six works by Hassam in the permanent art collection of the [[White House]] in [[Washington DC]].

Between 1916 and 1919, Hassam completed around 30 paintings of streets decorated with flags. This work dates to February 1917, shortly before the US joined the [[First World War]], at a time when patriotic fervour was rising in the US. The previous month, Germany extended its [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] to neutral ships, including vessels bearing the US flag.  The [[Zimmermann Telegram]] became public knowledge at the end of February 1917, and the US [[American entry into World War I|declared war on Germany]] on 6 April 1917.

The painting measures {{convert|42|x|22.25|in|cm}} and is dominant by red and blue and whites tones, representing the [[Flag of the United States|stars and stripes]]. Several dark figures in the middle distance hold umbrellas, and while the far distance fades into the blue background. The flags seem to float in mid-air, flying from poles that project out from the buildings on the street, but the buildings are not visible. The flags and human figures are reflected on the wet street and sidewalk. Hassam may have been influenced by two similar works of [[Claude Monet]] depicting [[Bastille Day|national celebrations]] in Paris on 30 June 1878.

It was donated to the White House in 1963 by [[Thomas Mellon Evans]] and hung between the windows in [[John F. Kennedy]]'s blue-themed [[President's Bedroom]] (now a private sitting room, adjacent to the [[Yellow Oval Room]] on the second floor), and then in the [[President's Dining Room]] for many years.  It hung in the [[Oval Office]] during both [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Barack Obama]]'s terms.

'''''The King of the Golden River or The Black Brothers: A Legend of Stiria''''' by [[John Ruskin]] was originally written in 1841 for the twelve-year-old [[Effie Gray|Effie (Euphemia) Gray]], whom Ruskin later married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/ruskinchrn.html Cf. 1841 on this timeline]&lt;/ref&gt; It was published in book form in 1851, and became an early [[Victorian era|Victorian]] classic which sold out three editions. In the "Advertisement to the First Edition", which prefaces it, it is called a [[fairy tale]], one, it might be added, that illustrates the triumph of love, kindness, and goodness over evil; however, it could also be characterised as a [[fable]], a fabricated [[origin myth]] and a [[parable]]. It was illustrated with 22 illustrations by [[Richard Doyle (illustrator)|Richard Doyle]] (1824–83).&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Sesame and Lilies'', ''The Two Paths,'' ''The King of the Golden River'', Everyman's Library, (New York: Dutton, 1907), 243&lt;/ref&gt; It was then illustrated by [[Arthur Rackham]] in 1932.

== Plot summary ==
The richness of the Treasure Valley, high in the mountains of Stiria or [[Styria]], southeastern [[Austria]], is lost through the evil of the owners, the two elder, "Black Brothers", Hans and Schwartz, who in their foolishness mistreat Southwest Wind, Esquire, who in turn floods their valley, washing away their "liquid assets", and turning their valley into a dead valley of red sand.

This personified wind has the power to keep things this way through his influence with other winds that had caused the valley's unique fertility. Forced into a trade other than farming Hans and Schwartz become goldsmiths. They cruelly melt their younger brother Gluck's prize heirloom, a golden mug, which consists of the head of a golden bearded man. This action releases the King of the Golden River for Gluck to pour out of the crucible as a finely dressed little golden dwarf. The Golden River is one of the high mountain cataracts, that surround the Treasure Valley. Gluck fancies that it would be good if that high majestic river would actually be what it appears in the setting sun, a river of gold. The dwarfish king disagrees with Gluck, but offers a proposition: if someone were to climb up to the source of the river and throw into it at least three drops of "[[holy water]]", it would become for that person only a river of gold. That person must do it on his first and only attempt or be overwhelmed by the river to become a black stone.
{{Wikisource|The King of the Golden River|''The King of the Golden River''}}
Hans and Schwartz desire to take the challenge, duel each other with the result that Schwartz is thrown into jail for disturbing the peace. Hans, who had the good sense to hide from the constable, steals holy water from the church and climbs up the mountains to the Golden River. He has a hard time of it on a glacier and gets away without his provisions and only his flask of holy water. Overcome with thirst Hans is forced to drink from this flask, knowing that only three drops are all that's needed. Along the path, Hans comes across three prostrate individuals dying of thirst, a puppy, a fair child, and an old man. Hans satisfies his own thirst while denying the three needy individuals.

The "demeanor" of the surroundings of his journey turns bleak and inauspicious, climaxing in Hans being transformed into a black stone once he has hurled the holy water flask into the Golden River. Gluck secures the release of his brother Schwartz, who, buying his holy water from a "bad priest", eventually fares likewise, spurning in his turn the fair child, the old man, and his brother Hans lying prostrate in his path. The Golden River then acquires another black stone around which to rush and wail.

Gluck takes a turn at climbing the mountain. He encounters first an old man walking down the mountain trail who begs water from the flask. Gluck allows him to drink, leaving only a third of the holy water. He then encounters a fair child, lying by the road, whom he allows to drink all but a few drops. Following these unselfish acts, Gluck's path is made bright and pleasant making him feel better than he had in his whole life—no doubt, due to his kindness. He then comes across the prostrate puppy, whom he gives the final drops of the holy water. The puppy turns into the King of the Golden River, who tells Gluck the reason for the deadly fate of his two brothers: the water they had thrown into the river was made unholy by their denying it to those dying of thirst on the way. Thereupon, he shakes three drops of dew from a lily into Gluck's flask to throw into the river and then vanishes by evaporation. Gluck throws the dew drops into the Golden River, and it forms a whirlpool where it goes underground and then emerges in the Treasure Valley. The Treasure Valley becomes lush and fertile once again. Gluck the new owner is a wealthy man, who never turns away the needy from his door. Ever afterward, though, the people show and tell travellers the tale of the two black stones in the Golden River, known as The Black Brothers.

==Characters==
* '''Schwartz''' – (his name means "black" in German),&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''The King of the Golden River or The Black Brothers: A Legend of Stiria'', [[Katharine Lee Bates]], ed., (Chicago: Rand, McNally &amp; Co., 1903), 74.&lt;/ref&gt; one of the two "Black Brothers". He and his brother Hans are described as very ugly men with overhanging eybrows and small, "dull" eyes, which they kept half closed.
* '''Hans''' – (his name is the common "John" in German), the other of the two "Black Brothers". Both are cruel to both animals and people, and they enjoy nothing better than drinking out their last penny at the neighbouring alehouse.
* '''Gluck''' – (should be Glück; his name means "luck" or "happiness" in German; the name is a wish of "good luck": "G' Luck!"),&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem''.&lt;/ref&gt; the twelve-year-old kid brother of the "Black Brothers". In striking contrast to his elder brothers, he is blond-haired and blue-eyed and kindly disposed to all living things.
* '''Southwest Wind, Esquire''' – a personified wind, who visits the three brothers in the Treasure Valley. He stands about four feet, six inches, has a brass coloured nose and red cheeks that look like he had been blowing a refractory fire for 48 hours, silky eyelashes, and a moustache that curls twice around on each side of his face. He wears a conical hat that is almost as tall as he is, and a cloak that stretches about four times his height when blown by the wind.After his ill treatment by Hans &amp; Schwartz, he—and the other winds—avoid Treasure Valley and cause it to become barren.
* '''The King of the Golden River''' – a golden dwarf entrapped by "a stronger king" as a golden heirloom mug in Gluck's possession, freed through the melting of the mug, king of the river that cascades from the cataracts surrounding the Treasure Valley.

== Structure and forces ==
This [[fairy tale]] also has the character of an [[origin myth|aetiological myth]]—a story devised to explain why things are as they are in the world. It is structured like an epic saga with each of the chapters closing on one solitary curiosity: Chapter One, the card identifying Southwest Wind, Esquire; Chapter Two, the mug becoming a released King of the Golden River; Chapter Three, Hans becoming a black stone; Chapter Four, Schwartz becoming a companion black stone; and Chapter Five, the black stones being known as the "Black Brothers".

[[Image:KGR Black Brothers.jpg|left|250px|thumb|''The Black Brothers'']]

Another view is that of Oliver Lodge, editor, of the Everyman's Library edition of the work:&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''Sesame and Lilies'', ''The Two Paths,'' ''The King of the Golden River'', Everyman's Library, (New York: Dutton, 1907), X.&lt;/ref&gt; "The parable is in two halves, a sort of [[Paradise Lost]] and a [[Paradise Regained]]—lost by selfishness, regained by love."&lt;ref name="Ibidem"&gt;''Ibidem''&lt;/ref&gt;

Water is the force that makes and unmakes things. The Treasure Valley never fails to have the proper watering to be perpetually lush. It is then destroyed by the water of a torrential flood. It is restored through the water of the Golden River becoming for the kindhearted Gluck a river of gold. Water's power appears in the treacherous glacier, which frightens those who traverse it with its sounds of rushing water and cracking ice. Water as "holy water" causes the miraculous transformation of the Golden River into a "river of gold" at the behest of the king. The King of the Golden River himself disappeared through the process of evaporation, a "water" phenomenon.

In this fairy tale the environment responds positively or negatively to human good or evil. There is the interplay of personified forces of nature like winds and rivers.

Lodge also enlightens us as to the lesson learned by the Black Brothers becoming goldsmiths and Gluck's wish that the Golden River become a literal river of gold: "And the restoration of wealth to Treasure Valley, by restoring the fertility of its soil instead of by metalliferous undertakings, is entirely in harmony with the author's consistent teaching that all true material increase must come from the soil".&lt;ref name="Ibidem"/&gt; Note that the King of the Golden River was imprisoned through "metalliferous undertakings".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibidem'', X-XI.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==
As stated above, this story could also be classed as a fable by which John Ruskin can impart to his readers that love, kindness, and philanthropy could transform the world as it did the Treasure Valley. No doubt, he speaks through the King of the Golden River when he tells Gluck: "the water which has been refused to the cry of the weary and dying is unholy, though it had been blessed by every saint in heaven; and the water which is found in the vessel of mercy is holy, though it had been defiled with corpses".&lt;ref&gt;John Ruskin, ''The King of the Golden River or The Black Brothers: A Legend of Stiria'', Katharine Lee Bates, ed., (Chicago: Rand, McNally &amp; Co., 1903), 57, lines 1075–1080.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Raising of Lazarus''''', c. 1609, in the [[Museo Regionale]], [[Messina]], is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Caravaggio]] (1571–1610). 

In August 1608 Caravaggio fled from [[Malta]], where he had been imprisoned for an unknown crime, and took refuge in Sicily with his friend, the artist [[Mario Minniti]]. Through Minniti's intercession he procured a number of important commissions, including this for the church of the Padri Crociferi in Messina, where it was presented by the wealthy Genoese merchant Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari on 10 June 1609. The fee was a thousand scudi, more than double any Caravaggio had received previously.

Lazarus, the brother of Martha and Mary, was the patron saint of Giovanni Battista de' Lazzari, to whom Caravaggio was contracted to paint an altarpiece in the church of the Padri Crociferi. The [[Gospel of John]] tells how he fell sick, died, was buried and then miraculously raised from the dead by Christ. As in several paintings from this period of Caravaggio's career, the scene is set against blank walls that overwhelm the frieze of human actors. The interaction of the relief of figures caught in corporate effort and emotion, with a large void above, is quite different from the closely focussed individualised dramas of his early and middle periods. As is usual with Caravaggio, light becomes an important element in the drama, picking out crucial details such as Lazarus's hands—one lax and open to receive, the other reaching towards Christ—and the wonder-struck faces of the onlookers.

The old story that Caravaggio had a freshly buried body exhumed for this painting is "probably apocryphal, but not beyond the bounds of possibility" (John Gash, see below). Some of the figures were said to be modelled on members of the community, but Caravaggio has also relied on his memory—the whole design is based on an engraving after Giulio Romano and his Jesus is a reversed image of the Christ who called Matthew to join him in ''[[The Calling of Saint Matthew (Caravaggio)|The Calling of Saint Matthew]]''. The painting is in poor condition and much restored, and it's possible that some passages are the work of assistants.

According to Francesco Susinno, Caravaggio had produced a first version that he destroyed with a razor after adverse criticism. Subsequently he would have finished in record time the present version, but probably this account is fanciful.

The '''Tomb of the Unknown Soldier''' ({{lang-ro|Mormântul Soldatului Necunoscut}}) is a monument located in Bucharest, Romania. Dedicated to the soldiers who died while fighting for [[Romania]]. It is one of many such [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier|national tombs]].

It was built in 1923 to commemorate the Romanians who died during [[World War I]].

==History==
In 1923 it was decided to choose one of the fallen soldiers to represent all who had sacrificed their lives during the [[Romania during World War I|war]].

Ten unidentified soldiers who died at [[Battle of Mărăşeşti|Mărăşeşti]], [[Battle of Mărăşti|Mărăşti]], [[Oituz]], [[Târgu Ocna]], [[Târgu Jiu|Jiu]], [[Prahova County|Prahova]], [[Bucharest]], in [[Dobruja]], [[Transylvania]] and [[Bassarabia]] were exhumed and laid in oak coffins, doubled with zinc, inside the "[[Assumption of Mary]]" Church in [[Mărășești]].

On May 13, 1923, the war orphan [[Amilcar Săndulescu]], student at the "[[Dimitrie Sturdza]]" Military High School, knelt in front of the fourth coffin and said: "''This is my father''". After the Unknown Soldier had been chosen, the other nine coffins were buried with military honors in the Heroes' Cemetery in Mărăşeşti.

On May 15, 1923, the Unknown Soldier's coffin, wrapped in a [[Flag of Romania|Romanian Tricolour]], was placed on board of a special train to [[Bucharest]], where it was waited for by the King [[Ferdinand of Romania|Ferdinand]], state officials and an [[honor guard]]. Laid on a cannon carriage pulled by eight horses, the coffin was transported in a long procession to the "[[Michael the Brave|Mihai Vodă]]" Church and remained there for 2 more days, so the people could pay their last respects.

On May 17, 1923 (which was also [[Holidays in Romania|Heroes' Day]]/[[Ascension of Jesus Christ|Ascension Day]]), the coffin was buried inside a crypt in [[Carol Park]] with full military honors in the presence of the Royal family, the Government, members of Parliament, and numerous members of the public. The stone slab of the crypt read: "''Here lies at rest happily unto the Lord the Unknown Soldier, who sacrificed his life for the unity of the Romanian people. On his bones lies the land of united Romania. 1916–1919.''"

On the night of December 22/23, 1958, the Unknown Soldier’s monument was dismantled and moved, in great secrecy, to the [[Mărășești]] Mausoleum by the [[Communist Romania|Communist regime]] to make room for the [[Carol Park#Mausoleum|Mausoleum of the Communist Heroes]], where several leaders of the [[Romanian Communist Party|Party]] were later interred (among them [[Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej]]).

In 1991, after the fall of the regime, the Tomb was moved back into the Carol Park, closer to its original location.

In 2007 the Tomb was moved even closer to its original 1923 location, right next to the Communist mausoleum.

'''Underground art''', is any form of [[art]] that operates outside of conventional norms in the art world, part of [[underground culture]]. This can include essentially any [[genre]] of art that is not popular in the art world, including [[visionary art]] and [[street art]]. Underground art can include art created both legally and illegally, organized or unauthorized, and can essentially exist in any form.

Visionary Art is often considered a form of underground art because of it popularity outside conventional art channels. Rather than being displayed in [[art gallery|galleries]] and [[museum]]s, most visionary art is displayed online, at music festivals, or other forms of gatherings such as Burning Man and Rainbow Gatherings.

Street Art, also is often considered a form of underground art because of its unconventional settings. Again, rather than galleries and museums, street art exists in outdoors spaces, utilizing stickers, [[Lock On (street art)|Lock On]] sculptures, [[Street installation|installations]], [[Stencil graffiti|stencils]], and/or [[spray paint]] as its medium.

[[Graffiti]], a form of street art, typically refers to illegal forms of street art. Public response to graffiti is not always favorable and is often negative. Others say that unauthorized art comes from a desire to spread beauty and make [[cityscape]]s more interesting by painting over blank or barren walls.
A controversial point is whether or not these types of art should be taught in a formal setting. Guerrilla art falls under that umbrella of thought.  It is understood, that these acts mostly happen on [[public property]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.valleyadvocate.com/article.cfm?aid=7556|title=Stage - Vaude-Villains|accessdate=2008-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-daum12apr12,0,5834055.column|title=Obama as an Art Form|accessdate=2008-04-25 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080613080430/http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/la-oe-daum12apr12,0,5834055.column &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Videoart at Midnight''' is an international forum fostering [[contemporary art]], in particular [[film]], [[new media art]] and [[video art]]. In a monthly program international artists are invited to show their work in the big cinema hall of the [[Kino Babylon]] in the [[Mitte (locality)|Mitte]] neighborhood of [[Berlin]].

== Background ==
''Videoart at Midnight'' is a private initiative, founded in 2008 by Olaf Stüber and organized since then together with Ivo Wessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mutualart/your-passport-to-video-ar_b_4781107.html/ Your Passport to Video Art Around the World] on: The Huffington Post, April 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exberliner.com/culture/art/video-art-at-midnight/ Davies-Crook, Susanna: "We force our audience a little bit"] on: EXBERLINER, April 9, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://medium.com/arts-ideas/stay-up-late-drafting-a-midnight-manifesto-9a1754f08213/ Stay Up Late! Towards a Midnight Manifesto] on: ARTS &amp; IDEAS, Oct 17, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Once a month on a Friday always at midnight the two art proponents invite artists to show their works within in the "[[Dispositif]] cinema" to put them up for discourse. Every night is dedicated to one artist. The artist is present. It is often the occasion for a premiere of a video work, sometimes accompanied by live acts, such as performances, concerts, lectures or artist talks.&lt;ref name =":4"&gt;[https://blog.artconnect.com/2013/11/08/berlin-premiere-the-lost-by-reynolds-reynolds/ Anastasia Trinh: Berlin Premiere: THE LOST by Reynold Reynolds] on: artconnect, November 8, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;[http://www.degem.de/berlin-miss-moth-chris-newman-seth-josel-bill-dietz-in-berlin-2/ Bill Dietz: Berlin – MISS MOTH (Chris Newman, Seth Josel, Bill Dietz) in Berlin] on: Deutsche Gesellschaft für Elektroakustische Musik e.V., October 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''World Tales''''', subtitled "'''The Extraordinary Coincidence of Stories Told in All Times, in All Places'''" is a book of 65 [[Fairy tale|folk tales]] collected by [[Idries Shah]] from around the world, mostly from literary sources. Some of the tales are very current, others are less well known.

==Content==
Each story is preceded by a short introduction by the author, giving a brief history of the tale's literary mutations, or remarking on the strange similarities that versions exhibit across great geographical or historical distances.&lt;ref&gt;For example, asking, with reference to the story of [[Childe Rowland]]: "How can it be that the same story is found in Scotland and also in pre-Columbian America?"&lt;/ref&gt; The collection has had a broad appeal. For instance Canadian poet [[P. K. Page]] cited it as the book she would give to a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/writersandcompany/98readings.html|title=Home - Writers &amp; Company with Eleanor Wachtel - CBC Radio|date=12 January 2016|website=Cbc.ca|accessdate=2017-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author and storyteller [[Norah Dooley]]:&lt;ref name="NorahDolley"&gt;{{cite web

Whilst Shah mentions many of the ancient and modern interpretations that have been placed on the tales, along with some of the theories of [[Fairy tale#Cross-cultural transmission|cross-cultural transmission]], he himself interprets them little, writing in the introduction: 
{{cquote| Working for thirty-five years among the written and oral sources of our world heritage in tales, one feels a truly living element in them which is startlingly evident when one isolates the 'basic' stories: the ones which tend to have travelled furthest, to have featured in the largest number of classical collections, to have inspired great writers of the past and present.}} 
The value that Shah put on folklore of this kind is clear, not only from the many volumes of tales that he published but also from books published by his children. The title alone of one of his daughter [[Saira Shah]]'s books, ''The Storyteller's Daughter'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
  | last = Shah
  | first = Saira
  | title = The Storyteller's Daughter
  | publisher = Penguin Books Ltd
  | year = 2004
  | isbn =  0-14-101026-6 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; gives some indication, while his son [[Tahir Shah]]'s book ''[[In Arabian Nights]]'', itself an exploration of the power of the folktale, recalls:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|When my father died a decade ago, I inherited his library. There were five reinforced boxes of books labeled "STORIES: VALUABLE, HANDLE WITH CARE". Among them were [[Aesop's Fables|Aesop's ''Fables'']], [[Hans Christian Andersen]], and the [[Brothers Grimm]]. There were many others too, the Arab collections and volumes of tales from every corner of the world... }}

&lt;/ref&gt; with each tale illustrated. Originally Shah asked [[Ivan Tyrrell]] to find illustrations for the tales by the likes of [[Arthur Rackham]], [[Kay Nielsen]] and [[Edmund Dulac]]. Tyrrell instead suggested commissioning new work, Shah agreed to this and the idea was put to, and approved by, the publisher, [[William Jovanovich]].&lt;ref name="listening"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tyrrell|first1=Ivan|title=Listening to Idries Shah|date=2016|publisher=Human Givens Publishing|isbn=978-1899398089|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty seven artists&lt;ref&gt;David Aicken, Wayne Anderson, Philip Argent, [[Peter Brookes]], Fred Carver, Doranna, Roy Ellsworth, Brian Froud, Tim Gill, Peter Goodfellow, Melvyn Grant, Lynda Gray, Colin Hadley, Ivan Hissey, Ken Laidlaw, Roger Langton, Carol Lawson, Janina Lech, [[Alan Lee (illustrator)|Alan Lee]], James Marsh, Chris McEwan, Tony Meeuwissen, Martin Newton, David O'Connor, Joe Petagno, Sue Porter, Peter Richardson, Carolyn Scrace, Caroline Smith, Mike Terry, [[Alan Tunbridge]], [[Ivan Tyrrell]], George Underwood, Malcolm Walker, Mai Watts, Juan Wijngaard and Ray Winder&lt;/ref&gt; contributed. This edition is no longer in print; the [[Octagon Press]] edition is text only.

Agnes Perkins, writing in the ''[[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]]'' cited this "lavish" edition of ''World Tales'' as an example of books that bridge the gap between illustrated books of folktales published for the juvenile market which pay little attention to sources or to authenticity of tone and language and which supply none of the working tools developed for folklore scholarship which might lead readers to further study of tales from the oral tradition, and collections by folklorists concerned primarily with local variants and the unusual persistence of motifs which ignore questions of the value of the stories from a literary standpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Agnes Perkins|year= 1981|title= Folklore and Children's Books: Bridging the Gap|journal= [[Children's Literature Association Quarterly]]  |volume= 6|issue= 2|pages= 1–37 |doi=10.1353/chq.0.1667}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9471">'''Yuji Yoshimura''' (February 27, 1921 [[Tokyo, Japan]] – December 24, 1997 [[Boston, Massachusetts]]) was a second-generation distinguished [[bonsai]] master who taught traditional Japanese techniques and aesthetics to enthusiasts in the [[Western world|West]].

==Early life and career==

Yoshimura was the second son born to the family of Toshiji Yoshimura. Toshiji (1891-1975) was a leader in the bonsai world and one of the top [[suiseki]] (viewing stone) authorities in Japan. He was also a co-founder of the Nippon Bonsai Society. Toshiji's father had been a [[samurai]] and a renowned garden designer.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1952, the 31-year-old Yoshimura, assisted by German agricultural diplomat Alfred Koehn, began the first bonsai course for foreigners in Tokyo at his Kofu-en nursery. Yoshimura refused to believe the prevailing wisdom that westerners could not understand, appreciate, or technically master bonsai. The class was an instant success, and within three years over 600 students—mostly foreign dignitaries, military personnel and businessmen and their wives—took the six-lesson course in classical bonsai art.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 32-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the class, Yoshimura grouped the various stylings of bonsai trees into five primary categories.  He also systematized much information that previously had only been passed down orally and by example from teacher to student.  With the assistance of Giovanna M. Halford, a student of his from England, Yoshimura worked on a companion text.  Empirical information about hundreds of types of plants used for the compositions was also compiled into a detailed database at the end of the book.  In 1957, ''The Japanese Art of Miniature Trees and Landscapes'' was published by [[Tuttle Publishing|Charles E. Tuttle Co.]] of [[Rutland (city), Vermont|Rutland, Vermont]] and Tokyo.  Although there had been a few earlier Bonsai books in English by this time, this was the first comprehensive and practical work on the subject. It was received with excitement by those who were eager to learn classical bonsai as refined during the first half of the twentieth century.  The book later came to be referred to as the "Bonsai Bible in English"; it is currently in its 37th printing.&lt;ref&gt;''Golden Statements'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoshimura was invited in 1958 to the [[Brooklyn Botanic Garden]] by its director George Avery. Yoshimura came to the United States with over one ton of teaching and demonstrating material, and six weeks later he gave his first course at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, entitled "Bonsai Study &amp; Practice". This very successful course was one of many which Yoshimura taught on many levels during the spring and autumn of that year while on the C. Stuart Gager fellowship grant.  Yoshimura extended his teaching and lecturing to the West Coast and Hawaii, later returning to teach at Longwood Garden near Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dillon&gt;Dillon, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=val34&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962 Yoshimura spent two months in Australia, where he made a lasting impression.  Bonsai was still in its infancy in Australia, and he assisted the early teachers and students, and became the patron of a bonsai group.&lt;ref name=val35&gt;Valvanis, "Yuji Yoshimura", p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 1963, Yoshimura and several of his students founded the Bonsai Society of Greater New York. Within three years there were 555 members, including 339 corresponding members in thirty-one states and several foreign countries.&lt;ref name=dillon/&gt;&lt;ref name=val35/&gt;

==Later career and influence==

During 1972, Yoshimura delivered a lecture in which he spoke of the "dream of American bonsaists for a place where they could give or will their treasures, knowing that the trees would be cared for and viewed by visitors for years to come." Newly appointed Director of the [[U.S. National Arboretum]] Dr. John L. Creech was in attendance. Creech had been a frequent visitor to Yoshimura's Tokyo garden in the early 1950s and was actually the one who had recommended the bonsai authority to Dr. Avery of the BBG.

Impressed by his old friend's thoughts and the fledgling Potomac Bonsai Association's first show at the National Arboretum, Dr. Creech then approached his departmental heads with the suggestion that acquiring a major bonsai collection might play a role in the Department of Agriculture's bicentennial plans. Receiving encouragement, Dr. Creech sought the help of longtime friends in the world of Japanese horticulture.  The result was a bicentennial gift to the U.S. from persons and organizations in Japan of fifty-three bonsai and six suiseki (viewing stones) which became the initial collection in the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum.&lt;ref name=val34/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"How It All Began", p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

His convention and club lectures, workshops, demonstrations, and articles in Western and Japanese specialty magazines spread Yoshimura's philosophy.  His most important American student was [[William N. Valavanis]].  Yoshimura assisted his student, who became a well-respected teacher in his own right, in launching the premier issue in the Spring of 1979 of the quarterly ''International Bonsai''. The elder sensei also translated its first article -- "Creation of Small Size Satsuki Azalea Bonsai"—from the Japanese magazine source. Valavanis' independent magazine continues to be published to this day.

In 1982 Yoshimura conducted a teaching tour for the bonsai clubs in India. 
Also that year the [[National Bonsai Foundation]], Inc., a non-profit corporation in Washington, D.C., was formed on behalf of the National Bonsai and Penjing Museum of the National Arboretum. [[John Naka]], Yuji Yoshimura, and now former Arboretum Director Dr. John L. Creech were elected as advisors to the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;"How It All Began", p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dannett, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 ''The Japanese Art of Stone Appreciation, Suiseki and Its Use with Bonsai'' was published by Charles E. Tuttle Co. The authors were Vincent T. Covello and Yuji Yoshimura.  This would also become a go-to reference work on the subject.

The John Y. Naka Pavilion was dedicated in October 1990 to house the National Collection of North American Bonsai. Connected to the Naka Pavilion is the Yoshimura Center housing a lecture and workshop room. Two of Yoshimura's bonsai are in the National Collection.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Profile of an Artist, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Bonsai Foundation, Inc. established the Yuji Yoshimura Fund as a permanent endowment to keep this great artist's spirit alive for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;Valvanis, "Profile of an Artist", p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having lived in the Western world for over thirty-five years, Yoshimura had personally observed the differences in the Eastern and Western cultures as reflected by their arts. Although his students had been primarily of the United States, he taught classical bonsai to thousands of students worldwide. In that Yuji Yoshimura was a Japanese bonsai artist who lived outside Japan for such a long span of years, he became a direct link between Japanese classical bonsai traditions and the progressive Western approach. The result was an elegant and refined school of bonsai adapted for the modern world.  And Yoshimura encouraged the use of native plants and local stylings by enthusiasts around the globe practicing this now widespread art.&lt;ref&gt;''Golden Statements'', pp. 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Yoshimura became the second inductee into the [[National Bonsai Foundation|National Bonsai &amp; Penjing Museum]]'s Bonsai Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bonsaibark.com/2017/10/12/bill-valavanis-inducted-into-the-bonsai-hall-of-fame/| author= Schoech, Wayne| title= Bill Valavanis Inducted into the Bonsai Hall of Fame |date=2017-10-12 |accessdate=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
