The emergence and need for the analysis of different types of data generated through biological research has given rise to the field of [[bioinformatics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothberg|first=J|author2=Merriman, B|author3= Higgs, G|title=Bioinformatics. Introduction|journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine|date=September 2012|volume=85|issue=3|pages=305–8|pmid=23189382|pmc=3447194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular sequence and structure data of [[DNA]], [[RNA]], and [[proteins]], [[gene expression]] profiles or [[microarray]] data, [[metabolic pathway]] data are some of the major types of data being analysed in bioinformatics. Among them sequence data is increasing at the exponential rate due to advent of next-generation sequencing technologies. Since the origin of bioinformatics, [[sequence analysis]] has remained the major area of research with wide range of applications in database searching, [[genome annotation]], [[comparative genomics]], [[molecular phylogeny]] and [[gene prediction]]. The pioneering approaches for sequence analysis were based on [[sequence alignment]] either global or local, pairwise or [[multiple sequence alignment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batzoglou|first=S|title=The many faces of sequence alignment|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=March 2005|volume=6|issue=1|pages=6–22|pmid=15826353|doi=10.1093/bib/6.1.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mullan|first=L|title=Pairwise sequence alignment—it's all about us!|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=March 2006|volume=7|issue=1|pages=113–5|pmid=16761368|doi=10.1093/bib/bbk008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alignment-based approaches generally give excellent results when the sequences under study are closely related and can be reliably aligned, but when the sequences are divergent, a reliable alignment cannot be obtained and hence the applications of sequence alignment are limited. Another limitation of alignment-based approaches is their computational complexity and are time-consuming and thus, are limited when dealing with large-scale sequence data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kemena|first=C|author2=Notredame, C|title=Upcoming challenges for multiple sequence alignment methods in the high-throughput era|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Oct 1, 2009|volume=25|issue=19|pages=2455–65|pmid=19648142|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btp452|pmc=2752613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advent of [[next-generation sequencing]] technologies has resulted in generation of voluminous sequencing data. The size of this sequence data poses challenges on alignment-based algorithms in their assembly, annotation and comparative studies.

== Alignment-free methods ==
Alignment-free methods can broadly be classified into four categories: a) methods based on ''k''-mer/word frequency, b) methods based on substrings, c) methods based on information theory and d) methods based on graphical representation.

=== Methods based on ''k''-mer/word frequency ===
The popular methods based on ''k''-mer/word frequencies include feature frequency profile (FFP),&lt;ref name="FFP"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims|first=GE|author2=Jun, SR|author3= Wu, GA|author4= Kim, SH|title=Whole-genome phylogeny of mammals: evolutionary information in genic and nongenic regions.|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=Oct 6, 2009|volume=106|issue=40|pages=17077–82|pmid=19805074|doi=10.1073/pnas.0909377106|pmc=2761373|bibcode=2009PNAS..10617077S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sims|first=GE|author2=Kim, SH|title=Whole-genome phylogeny of Escherichia coli/Shigella group by feature frequency profiles (FFPs).|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America|date=May 17, 2011|volume=108|issue=20|pages=8329–34|pmid=21536867|doi=10.1073/pnas.1105168108|pmc=3100984|bibcode=2011PNAS..108.8329S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Composition vector (CV),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=L|author2=Qi, J|title=Whole genome molecular phylogeny of large dsDNA viruses using composition vector method.|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=Mar 15, 2007|volume=7|pages=41|pmid=17359548|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-7-41|pmc=1839080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=H|author2=Xu, Z|author3= Gao, L|author4= Hao, B|title=A fungal phylogeny based on 82 complete genomes using the composition vector method.|journal=BMC Evolutionary Biology|date=Aug 10, 2009|volume=9|pages=195|pmid=19664262|doi=10.1186/1471-2148-9-195|pmc=3087519}}&lt;/ref&gt; Return time distribution (RTD),&lt;ref name="RTD1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kolekar|first=P|author2=Kale, M|author3= Kulkarni-Kale, U|title=Alignment-free distance measure based on return time distribution for sequence analysis: applications to clustering, molecular phylogeny and subtyping.|journal=Molecular Phylogenetics &amp; Evolution|date=November 2012|volume=65|issue=2|pages=510–22|pmid=22820020|doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2012.07.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; frequency chaos game representation (FCGR).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatje|first=K|author2=Kollmar, M|title=A phylogenetic analysis of the brassicales clade based on an alignment-free sequence comparison method.|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|year=2012|volume=3|pages=192|pmid=22952468|doi=10.3389/fpls.2012.00192|pmc=3429886}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Spaced Words &lt;ref name=spaced /&gt;

==== Feature frequency profile (FFP) ====
The methodology involved in FFP based method starts by calculating the count of each possible ''k''-mer (possible number of ''k''-mers for nucleotide sequence: 4&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;, while that for protein sequence: 20&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;) in sequences. Each ''k''-mer count in each sequence is then normalized by dividing it by total of all ''k''-mers' count in that sequence. This leads to conversion of each sequence into its feature frequency profile. The pair wise distance between two sequences is then calculated [[Jensen–Shannon divergence|Jensen–Shannon (JS) divergence]] between their respective FFPs. The [[distance matrix]] thus obtained can be used to construct [[phylogenetic tree]] using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]] etc.

==== Composition vector (CV) ====
In this method frequency of appearance of each possible ''k''-mer in a given sequence is calculated. The next characteristic step of this method is the subtraction of random background of these frequencies using [[Markov model]] to reduce the influence of random neutral [[mutations]] to highlight the role of selective evolution. The normalized frequencies are put a fixed order to form the composition vector (CV) of a given sequence. [[Cosine distance]] function is then used to compute pairwise distance between CVs of sequences. The distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct phylogenetic tree using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]] etc. This method can be extended through resort to efficient pattern matching algorithms to include in the computation of the composition vectors: (i) all ''k''-mers for any value of ''k'', (ii) all substrings of any length up to an arbitrarily set maximum ''k'' value, (iii) all maximal substrings, where a substring is maximal if extending it by any character would cause a decrease in its occurrence count.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apostolico|first=A|author2=Denas, O |title=Fast algorithms for computing sequence distances by exhaustive substring composition.|journal=Algorithms for Molecular Biology|date=March 2008|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Apostolico|first=A|author2=Denas, O|author3= Dress, A |title=Efficient tools for comparative substring analysis.|journal= Journal of Biotechnology|date=September 2010|volume=149|issue=3|pages=120–126|doi=10.1016/j.jbiotec.2010.05.006|pmid=20682467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Return time distribution (RTD) ====
The RTD based method does not calculate the count of ''k''-mers in sequences, instead it computes the time required for the reappearance of 
''k''-mers. The time refers to the number of residues in successive appearance of particular ''k''-mer. Thus the occurrence of each ''k''-mer in a sequence is calculated in the form of RTD, which is then summarised using two statistical parameters [[mean]] (μ) and [[standard deviation]] (σ). Thus each sequence is represented in the form of numeric vector of size 2&amp;middot;4&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; containing ''μ'' and ''σ'' of 4&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; RTDs. The pair wise distance between sequences is calculated using [[Euclidean distance]] measure. The distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct phylogenetic tree using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]] etc.

==== Frequency chaos game representation (FCGR) ====
The FCGR methods have evolved from chaos game representation (CGR) technique, which provides scale independent representation for genomic sequences.&lt;ref name="Jeffrey 2163–70"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jeffrey|first=HJ|title=Chaos game representation of gene structure.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=April 25, 1990|volume=18|issue=8|pages=2163–70|pmid=2336393|doi=10.1093/nar/18.8.2163|pmc=330698}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CGRs can be divided by grid lines where each grid square denotes the occurrence of oligonucleotides of a specific length in the sequence. Such representation of CGRs is termed as Frequency Chaos Game Representation (FCGR). This leads to representation of each sequence into FCGR. The pair wise distance between FCGRs of sequences can be calculated using the Pearson distance, the Hamming distance or the Euclidean distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wang|first=Y|author2=Hill, K|author3= Singh, S|author4= Kari, L|title=The spectrum of genomic signatures: from dinucleotides to chaos game representation.|journal=Gene|date=Feb 14, 2005|volume=346|pages=173–85|pmid=15716010|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2004.10.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Spaced-word frequencies====
While most alignment-free algorithms compare the word-composition of sequences, Spaced Words uses a pattern of care and don't care positions. The occurrence of a spaced word in a sequence is then defined by the characters at the match positions only, while the characters at the don't care positions are ignored.  Instead of comparing the frequencies of contiguous words in the input sequences, this approach compares the frequencies of the spaced words according to the pre-defined pattern.&lt;ref name=spaced/&gt; Note that the pre-defined pattern can be selected by analysis of the [[Variance]] of the number of matches,&lt;ref name=rasbhari&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hahn|first=L|author2=Leimeister, CA|author3=Ounit, R|author4=Lonardi, S|author5=Morgenstern, B|title=rasbhari: Optimizing Spaced Seeds for Database Searching, Read Mapping and Alignment-Free Sequence Comparison.|journal=PLOS Computational Biology|date=Oct 19, 2016|volume=12|issue=10|pages=e1005107|pmid=27760124|doi=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005107|pmc=5070788|arxiv=1511.04001|bibcode=2016PLSCB..12E5107H}}&lt;/ref&gt; the probability of the first occurrence on several models,&lt;ref name=bhit&gt;{{cite journal|last=Noe|first=L|title=Best hits of 11110110111: model-free selection and parameter-free sensitivity calculation of spaced seeds.|journal=Algorithms for Molecular Biology|date=Feb 14, 2017|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1|doi=10.1186/s13015-017-0092-1|pmid=28289437|pmc=5310094}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Pearson correlation coefficient]] between the expected word frequency and the true alignment distance.&lt;ref name=Cov/&gt;

=== Methods based on substrings ===

The methods in this category employ the [[Semantic similarity|similarity]] and differences of substrings in a pair of sequences. These algorithms
were mostly used for string processing in [[computer science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gusfield|first=Dan|title=Algorithms on strings, trees, and sequences : computer science and computational biology|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge Univ. Press|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521585194|edition=Reprinted (with corr.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Average common substring (ACS) ====

In this approach, for a chosen pair of sequences (A and B of lengths ''n'' and ''m'' respectively), [[Longest common substring problem|longest substring]] starting at some position is identified in one sequence (A) which exactly matches in the other sequence (B) at any position. In this way, lengths of longest substrings starting at different positions in sequence A and having exact matches at some positions in sequence B are calculated. All these lengths are averaged to derive a measure &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively, larger the &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)&lt;/math&gt;, the more similar the two sequences are. To account for the differences in the length of sequences, &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)&lt;/math&gt; is normalized [i.e. &lt;math&gt;L(A, B)/\log(m)&lt;/math&gt;]. This gives the similarity measure between the sequences.

In order to derive a distance measure, the inverse of [[similarity measure]] is taken and a [[correction term]] is subtracted from it to assure that &lt;math&gt;d(A, A)&lt;/math&gt; will be zero. Thus

: &lt;math&gt;d(A, B) = \left [ \frac{\log m}{L(A, B)} \right] - \left[\frac{\log n}{L(A, A)} \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

This measure &lt;math&gt;d(A, B)&lt;/math&gt; is not symmetric, so one has to compute &lt;math&gt;d_s(A, B) = d_s(B, A) = (d(A, B) + d(B, A))/2&lt;/math&gt;, which gives final ACS measure between the two strings (A and B).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ulitsky|first=I|author2=Burstein, D|author3= Tuller, T|author4= Chor, B|title=The average common substring approach to phylogenomic reconstruction.|journal=Journal of Computational Biology : A Journal of Computational Molecular Cell Biology|date=March 2006|volume=13|issue=2|pages=336–50|pmid=16597244|doi=10.1089/cmb.2006.13.336|citeseerx=10.1.1.106.5122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequence/substring search can be efficiently performed by
using [[suffix tree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=P|chapter-url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=4569722|work=IEEE|doi=10.1109/SWAT.1973.13|title=14th Annual Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory (swat 1973)|pages=1–11|year=1973|chapter=Linear pattern matching algorithms|citeseerx=10.1.1.474.9582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=He|first=D|title=Using suffix tree to discover complex repetitive patterns in DNA sequences.|journal=Conference Proceedings : ...

==== ''k''-mismatch average common substring approach (kmacs) ====
This approach is a generalization of the ACS approach. To define the distance between two DNA or protein sequences, kmacs estimates for each position ''i'' of the first sequence the longest substring starting at ''i'' and matching a substring of the second sequence with up to ''k'' mismatches. It defines the average of these values as a measure of similarity between the sequences and turns this into a symmetric distance measure. Kmacs does not compute exact ''k''-mismatch substrings, since this would be computational too costly, but approximates such substrings.&lt;ref name=kmacs/&gt;

==== Mutation distances (Kr) ====

This approach is closely related to the ACS, which calculates the number of substitutions per site between two DNA sequences using the shortest 
absent substring (termed as shustring).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haubold|first=B|author2=Pfaffelhuber, P|author3= Domazet-Loso, M|author4= Wiehe, T|title=Estimating mutation distances from unaligned genomes.|journal=Journal of Computational Biology : A Journal of Computational Molecular Cell Biology|date=October 2009|volume=16|issue=10|pages=1487–500|pmid=19803738|doi=10.1089/cmb.2009.0106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods based on information theory ===

[[Information Theory]] has provided successful methods for alignment-free sequence analysis and comparison. The existing applications of information theory include global and local characterization of DNA, RNA and proteins, estimating genome entropy to motif and region classification. It also holds promise in [[gene mapping]], [[next-generation sequencing]] analysis and [[metagenomics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vinga|first=S|title=Information theory applications for biological sequence analysis.|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=Sep 20, 2013|pmid=24058049|doi=10.1093/bib/bbt068|volume=15|issue=3|pages=376–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Base–base correlation (BBC) ====

Base–base correlation (BBC) converts the genome sequence into a unique 16-dimensional numeric vector using the following equation,

: &lt;math&gt;T_{ij}(K) = \sum_{\ell=1}^K P_{ij}(\ell) \cdot \log_2 \left ( \frac{P_{ij}(\ell)}{P_i P_j} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes the probabilities of bases ''i'' and ''j'' in the genome. The &lt;math&gt;P_{ij}(\ell)&lt;/math&gt; indicates the probability of bases ''i'' and ''j'' at distance ''ℓ'' in the genome. The parameter ''K'' indicates the maximum distance between the bases ''i'' and ''j''. The variation in the values of 16 parameters reflect variation in the genome content and length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=Z|author2=Meng, J|author3= Sun, X|title=A novel feature-based method for whole genome phylogenetic analysis without alignment: application to HEV genotyping and subtyping.|journal=Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communications|date=Apr 4, 2008|volume=368|issue=2|pages=223–30|pmid=18230342|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2008.01.070}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liu|first=ZH|author2=Sun, X|title=Coronavirus phylogeny based on base-base correlation.|journal=International Journal of Bioinformatics Research and Applications|year=2008|volume=4|issue=2|pages=211–20|pmid=18490264|doi=10.1504/ijbra.2008.018347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cheng|first=J|author2=Zeng, X|author3= Ren, G|author4= Liu, Z|title=CGAP: a new comprehensive platform for the comparative analysis of chloroplast genomes.|journal=BMC Bioinformatics|date=Mar 14, 2013|volume=14|pages=95|pmid=23496817|pmc=3636126|doi=10.1186/1471-2105-14-95}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Information correlation and partial information correlation (IC-PIC) ====
IC-PIC ([[information correlation]] and partial information correlation) based method employs the base correlation property of DNA sequence. IC and PIC were calculated using following formulas,

: &lt;math&gt; IC_\ell = -2 \sum_i P_i \log_2 P_i + \sum_{ij} P_{ij} (\ell) \log_2 P_{ij} (\ell)&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; PIC_{ij} (\ell) = (P_{ij} (\ell) - P_i P_j (\ell))^2&lt;/math&gt;

The final vector is obtained as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;V = {IC_\ell \over PIC_{ij} (\ell)} \text{ where } \ell \isin \left \{ \ell_0, \ell_0 + 1, \ldots, \ell_0 + n \right \}, &lt;/math&gt;

which defines the range of distance between bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gao|first=Y|author2=Luo, L|title=Genome-based phylogeny of dsDNA viruses by a novel alignment-free method.|journal=Gene|date=Jan 15, 2012|volume=492|issue=1|pages=309–14|pmid=22100880|doi=10.1016/j.gene.2011.11.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pairwise distance between sequences is calculated using [[Euclidean distance]] measure. The distance matrix thus obtained can be used to construct phylogenetic tree using clustering algorithms like [[neighbor-joining]], [[UPGMA]], etc..

==== Lempel–Ziv compression ====
[[Lempel-Ziv complexity]] uses the [[relative information]] between the sequences. This complexity is measured by the number of steps required to generate a string given the prior knowledge of another string and a self-delimiting production process. This measure has a relation to measuring ''k''-words in a sequence, as they can be easily used to generate the sequence. It is computational intensive method. Otu and Sayood (2003) used this method to construct five different distance measures for [[phylogenetic tree]] construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Otu|first=HH|author2=Sayood, K|title=A new sequence distance measure for phylogenetic tree construction.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=Nov 1, 2003|volume=19|issue=16|pages=2122–30|pmid=14594718|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/btg295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Context modeling compression ====

In the context modeling complexity the next-symbol predictions, of one or more statistical models, are combined or competing to yield a prediction that is based on events recorded in the past. The algorithmic information content derived from each symbol prediction can be used to compute algorithmic information profiles with a time proportional to the length of the sequence. The process has been applied to DNA sequence analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pinho|first=A|author2=Garcia, S|author3=Pratas, D|author4=Ferreira, P|title=DNA Sequences at a Glance.|journal=PLOS ONE|date=Nov 21, 2013|volume=8|issue=11|pages=e79922|pmid=24278218|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0079922|pmc=3836782|bibcode=2013PLoSO...879922P}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Methods based on graphical representation ===

==== Iterated maps ====
The use of iterated maps for sequence analysis was first introduced by HJ Jefferey in 1990&lt;ref name="Jeffrey 2163–70"/&gt; when he proposed to apply the [[Chaos game|Chaos Game]] to map genomic sequences into a unit square. That report coined the procedure as Chaos Game Representation (CGR). However, only 3 years later this approach was first dismissed as a projection of a Markov transition table by N Goldman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goldman|first=N|title=Nucleotide, dinucleotide and trinucleotide frequencies explain patterns observed in chaos game representations of DNA sequences.|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|date=May 25, 1993|volume=21|issue=10|pages=2487–91|pmid=8506142|doi=10.1093/nar/21.10.2487|pmc=309551}}&lt;/ref&gt; This objection was overruled by the end of that decade when the opposite was found to be the case – that CGR bijectively maps Markov transition is into a fractal, order-free (degree-free) representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almeida|first=JS|author2=Carriço, JA|author3= Maretzek, A|author4= Noble, PA|author5= Fletcher, M|title=Analysis of genomic sequences by Chaos Game Representation.|journal=Bioinformatics|date=May 2001|volume=17|issue=5|pages=429–37|pmid=11331237|doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/17.5.429}}&lt;/ref&gt; The realization that iterated maps provide a bijective map between the symbolic space and numeric space led to the identification of a variety of alignment-free approaches to sequence comparison and characterization. These developments were reviewed in late 2013 by JS Almeida in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Almeida|first=JS|title=Sequence analysis by iterated maps, a review.|journal=Briefings in Bioinformatics|date=Oct 25, 2013|pmid=24162172|doi=10.1093/bib/bbt072|volume=15|issue=3|pages=369–375|pmc=4017330}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of web apps such as https://usm.github.com,&lt;ref name="Almeida 12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Almeida|first=Jonas S.|last2=Grüneberg|first2=Alexander|last3=Maass|first3=Wolfgang|last4=Vinga|first4=Susana|date=2012-05-02|title=Fractal MapReduce decomposition of sequence alignment|journal=Algorithms for Molecular Biology: AMB|volume=7|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/1748-7188-7-12|issn=1748-7188|pmc=3394223|pmid=22551205}}&lt;/ref&gt; are available to demonstrate how to encode and compare arbitrary symbolic sequences in a manner that takes full advantage of modern [[MapReduce]] distribution developed for cloud computing.

The object of the game is to [[Scoring in association football|score]] by moving the ball beyond the goal line into the opposing goal.

Association football is one of a family of [[Football|football codes]], which emerged from various ball games played worldwide since antiquity. The modern game traces its origins to 1863 when the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]] were originally codified in England by [[The Football Association]].

Players are not allowed to touch the ball with hands or arms while it is in play, except for the [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeepers]] within the [[penalty area]]. Other players mainly use their feet to strike or pass the ball, but may also use any other part of their body except the hands and the arms. The team that scores most goals by the end of the match wins. If the score is level at the end of the game, either a [[Tie (draw)|draw]] is declared or the game goes into [[extra time]] or a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] depending on the format of the competition. Association football is governed internationally by the [[FIFA|International Federation of Association Football]] (FIFA; {{lang-fr|Fédération Internationale de Football Association}}), which organises World Cups for both [[FIFA World Cup|men]] and [[FIFA Women's World Cup|women]] every four years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0,3509,10,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050314003412/http://www.fifa.com/en/marketing/newmedia/index/0%2C3509%2C10%2C00.html |archivedate=14 March 2005 |title=2002 FIFA World Cup TV Coverage |publisher=FIFA |date=5 December 2006 |accessdate=6 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rules of association football were codified in England by the Football Association in 1863 and the name ''association football'' was coined to distinguish the game from the [[Football|other forms of football]] played at the time, specifically [[rugby football]]. The first written "reference to the inflated ball used in the game" was in the mid-14th century: "Þe heued fro þe body went, Als it were a foteballe".&lt;ref name="Octavian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://d.lib.rochester.edu/teams/text/hudson-octavian|title=Octavian - Robbins Library Digital Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]'' states that the "rules of the game" were made in 1848, before the "split off in 1863".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170101162441/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=football|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|date=1 January 2017|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''soccer'' comes from a slang or jocular abbreviation of the word "association", with the suffix "-er" appended to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/whats-the-origin-of-the-word-soccer/|title=What's the origin of the word "soccer"?}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''soccer'' (which arrived at its final form in 1895) was first recorded in 1889 in the earlier form of ''socca.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/soccer#etymonline_v_23809|title=soccer {{!}} Origin and meaning of soccer by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com|access-date=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[English-speaking world]], association football is now usually called "football" in the United Kingdom and mainly "soccer" in Canada and the United States. People in Australia, Ireland, South Africa and New Zealand use either or both terms, although national associations in Australia and New Zealand now primarily use "football" for the formal name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Soccer/Soccer-to-become-football-in-Australia/2004/12/16/1102787198357.html|title=Soccer to become football in Australia|website=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[FIFA]], the Chinese competitive game ''[[cuju]]'' (蹴鞠, literally "kick ball")&lt;!--transliterated as Tsu' Chu in ref--&gt; is the earliest form of football for which there is evidence.&lt;ref name="fifa-or"/&gt; ''Cuju'' players could use any part of the body apart from hands and the intent was kicking a ball through an opening into a net. It was remarkably similar to modern football, though similarities to [[rugby football|rugby]] occurred.&lt;ref name="abd"&gt;{{cite book|last=Murray|first=Scott|title=Football For Dummies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IGy_QNv-J4oC&amp;pg=PT33|date=30 March 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-66440-7|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FIFAClassicFootball|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/origins.html|publisher=FIFA|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BC – 220 AD), ''cuju'' games were standardised and rules were established.&lt;ref name="abd"/&gt;

''Phaininda'', ''episkyros'' and ''harpastum'' were played involving hands and violence.

Association football in itself does not have a classical history.&lt;ref name=bangkokpost/&gt; Notwithstanding any similarities to other ball games played around the world FIFA has recognised that no historical connection exists with any game played in antiquity outside Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/the-game/Britain-home-of-football.html |title=Classic Football History of the Game |publisher=FIFA |date=10 June 2014 |accessdate=19 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern rules of association football are based on the mid-19th century efforts to standardise the widely [[English public school football games|varying forms of football]] played in the [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] of England. The history of football in England dates back to [[medieval football|at least the eighth century AD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of Football&amp;nbsp;– Britain, the home of Football | publisher=FIFA| url = https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame2.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070701210540/http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/history/game/historygame2.html| archivedate = 1 July 2007 | accessdate =20 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cambridge Rules]], first drawn up at Cambridge University in 1848, were particularly influential in the development of subsequent codes, including association football. The Cambridge Rules were written at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], at a meeting attended by representatives from [[Eton College|Eton]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]], [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Winchester College|Winchester]] and [[Shrewsbury School|Shrewsbury]] schools. They were not universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs unconnected to schools or universities were formed throughout the English-speaking world, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the [[Sheffield F.C.|Sheffield Football Club]], formed by former public school pupils in 1857,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Harvey |first=Adrian |title=Football, the first hundred years |publisher=Routledge |page=126 |year=2005 |location=London |isbn=0-415-35018-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to formation of a [[Sheffield &amp; Hallamshire Football Association|Sheffield FA]] in 1867. In 1862, [[J. C. Thring|John Charles Thring]] of [[Uppingham School]] also devised an influential set of rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Winner |date=28 March 2005 | title = The hands-off approach to a man's game |newspaper=The Times |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,27-1544006,00.html |accessdate=7 October 2007 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ongoing efforts contributed to the formation of [[The Football Association]] (The FA) in 1863, which first met on the morning of 26 October 1863 at the [[Freemasons' Tavern]] in [[Great Queen Street]], London.&lt;ref name="FAhistory"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the FA |publisher=Football Association (FA) |url=http://www.thefa.com/about-football-association/history |accessdate=9 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only school to be represented on this occasion was [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]. The Freemason's Tavern was the setting for five more meetings between October and December, which eventually produced the first comprehensive set of rules. At the final meeting, the first FA treasurer, the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]], withdrew his club from the FA over the removal of two draft rules at the previous meeting: the first allowed for running with the ball in hand; the second for obstructing such a run by hacking (kicking an opponent in the shins), tripping and holding. Other [[History of rugby union|English rugby clubs followed this lead]] and did not join the FA and instead in 1871 formed the [[Rugby Football Union]]. The eleven remaining clubs, under the charge of [[Ebenezer Cobb Morley]], went on to ratify the original thirteen laws of the game.&lt;ref name="FAhistory"/&gt; These rules included handling of the ball by "marks" and the lack of a crossbar, rules which made it remarkably similar to [[Australian rules football|Victorian rules football]] being developed at that time in Australia. The Sheffield FA played by its own rules until the 1870s with the FA absorbing some of its rules until there was little difference between the games.&lt;ref name="Merger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=Percy M.|year=1964|title=Football in Sheffield|pages=28–29|publisher=S. Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's oldest football competition is the [[FA Cup]], which was founded by [[C. W. Alcock]] and has been contested by English teams since 1872. The [[1872 Scotland vs England football match|first official international football match]] also took place in 1872, between Scotland and England in [[Glasgow]], again at the instigation of C. W. Alcock. England is also home to the world's first [[The Football League|football league]], which was founded in [[Birmingham]] in 1888 by [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of the Football League |publisher=The Football League |url=http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0,,10794~1357277,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501121005/http://www.football-league.co.uk/page/History/HistoryDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1357277%2C00.html |archivedate=1 May 2011 |date=22 September 2010 |accessdate=4 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The original format contained 12 clubs from the [[English Midlands|Midlands]] and [[Northern England]].

[[FIFA]], the international football body, was formed in Paris in 1904 and declared that they would adhere to Laws of the Game of the Football Association.&lt;ref name=Wherebegan/&gt; The growing popularity of the international game led to the admittance of FIFA representatives to the [[International Football Association Board]] in 1913.

====Early women's football====

Women may have been playing "football" for as long as the game has existed. Evidence shows that an ancient version of the game ([[Tsu Chu]]) was played by women during the [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE). Two female figures are depicted in [[Han Dynasty]] (25–220 CE) frescoes, playing Tsu Chu.&lt;ref name="globalgame"&gt;{{cite web|title=Genesis of the Global Game |work=The Global Game |url=http://www.theglobalgame.com/aboutus.html |accessdate=22 May 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521234151/http://www.theglobalgame.com/aboutus.html |archivedate=21 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, a number of opinions about the accuracy of dates, the earliest estimates at 5000 BCE.&lt;ref name="footballnetwork"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Chinese and Tsu Chu | work=The Football Network | url=http://www.footballnetwork.org/dev/historyoffootball/history1.asp | accessdate=1 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association football, the modern game, also has documented early involvement of women. An annual competition in Mid-Lothian, Scotland during the 1790s is reported, too.&lt;ref name="SFA"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Brief History of Women's Football|url=http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|publisher=Scottish Football Association|accessdate=18 November 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050308172042/http://www.scottishfa.co.uk/scottish_football.cfm?curpageid=409|archivedate=8 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12080678.display/|title=A game of two sexes|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=8 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1863, football governing bodies introduced standardised rules to prohibit violence on the pitch, making it more socially acceptable for women to play.&lt;ref name="FA"/&gt; The first match recorded by the [[Scottish Football Association]] took place in 1892 in [[Glasgow]].

The most well-documented early European team was founded by activist [[Nettie Honeyball]] in England in 1894. It was named the [[British Ladies' Football Club]]. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, "I founded the association late last year [1894], with the fixed resolve of proving to the world that women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of [[Feminism|emancipation]], and I look forward to the time when ladies may sit in [[Parliament]] and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." &lt;ref name="Nettie Honeyball"&gt;{{cite web | title=Women's involvement with soccer was part of the emancipation process | work=SoccerTimes | url=http://www.soccertimes.com/oped/1999/jul20.htm | accessdate=4 May 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061116204454/http://www.soccertimes.com/oped/1999/jul20.htm | archivedate=16 November 2006 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mårtensson|first=Stefan|title=Branding women's football in a field of hegemonic masculinity|journal=Entertainment and Sports Law Journal|date=June 2010|volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Women's football match Menai Bridge against Penrhos (24622680915).jpg|thumb|A Welsh women's football team pose for a photograph in 1959]]
Women's football became popular on a large scale at the time of the [[World War I|First World War]], when employment in heavy industry spurred the growth of the game, much as it had done for men fifty years earlier. The most successful team of the era was [[Dick, Kerr's Ladies]] of [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston, England]]. The team played in the first women's international matches in 1920, against a team from [[Paris]], France, in April, and also made up most of the England team against a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] Ladies XI in 1920, and winning 22-0.&lt;ref name="SFA"/&gt;

Despite being more popular than some men's football events (one match saw a 53,000 strong crowd),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leighton|first1=Tony|title=FA apologies for 1921 ban|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/feb/11/newsstory.womensfootball|work=The Guardian|accessdate=6 August 2014|date=10 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; women's football in England suffered a blow in 1921 when [[The Football Association]] outlawed the playing of the game on Association members' pitches, on the grounds that the game (as played by women) was distasteful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Witzig|first1=Richard|title=The Global Art of Soccer|date=2006|publisher=CusiBoy Publishing|isbn=0977668800|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/?id=H2T0ZD5S86QC&amp;pg=PA65&amp;lpg=PA65&amp;dq=1921+fa+ban#v=onepage&amp;q=1921%20fa%20ban|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some speculated that this may have also been due to envy of the large crowds that women's matches attracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/4603149.stm|title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football|date=3 June 2005|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to the formation of the [[English Ladies Football Association]] and play moved to [[rugby football|rugby]] grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Newsham|first1=Gail|title=In a League of Their Own. The Dick, Kerr Ladies 1917-1965|date=2014|publisher=Paragon Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Association football has been played by women since at least the time of the first recorded women's games in the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/football/no-longer-the-game-of-two-halves.19185657 |title=No longer the game of two-halves |work=The Herald |publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group |date=19 October 2012 |accessdate=9 March 2014 |first=Alan |last=Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt; It has traditionally been associated with charity games and physical exercise, particularly in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/women/4607171.stm |title=How women's football battled for survival |last=Gregory |first=Patricia |work=BBC sport |publisher=BBC |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1960s and early 1970s women's association football was organised in the United Kingdom, eventually becoming the most prominent [[team sport]] for British women.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt;

====20th and 21st century====
The growth in women's football has seen major competitions being launched at both [[Women's football around the world|national]] and [[international competitions in women's football|international]] level mirroring the male competitions. Women's football has faced many struggles. It had a "golden age" in the United Kingdom in the early 1920s when crowds reached 50,000 at some matches;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/women/4603149.stm |title=Trail-blazers who pioneered women's football |last=Alexander |first=Shelley |work=BBC sport |publisher=BBC |date=3 June 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was stopped on 5 December 1921 when England's Football Association voted to ban the game from grounds used by its member clubs. The FA's ban was rescinded in December 1969 with UEFA voting to officially recognise women's football in 1971.&lt;ref name="BBCwomen-Gregory"/&gt; The [[FIFA Women's World Cup]] was inaugurated in 1991 and has been held every four years since,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=103/awards/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430044344/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament%3D103/awards/index.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |title=Tournaments: Women's World Cup |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=11 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; while women's football has been an Olympic event [[football at the 1996 Summer Olympics&amp;nbsp;– Women's tournament|since 1996]].

==Gameplay==
[[File:U20-WorldCup2007-Okotie-Onka edit2.jpg|thumb|A goalkeeper saving a close-range shot from inside the penalty area]]

Association football is played in accordance with a set of rules known as the [[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of the Game]]. The game is played using a spherical ball of {{convert|68|–|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} circumference,&lt;ref&gt;[http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ Circumference - FIFA Quality Programme&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119053959/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Become-a-licensee/Tests/Circumference/ |date=19 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the ''[[Ball (association football)|football]]'' (or ''soccer ball''). Two teams of eleven players each compete to get the ball into the other team's goal (between the posts and under the bar), thereby scoring a goal. The team that has scored more goals at the end of the game is the winner; if both teams have scored an equal number of goals then the game is a draw. Each team is led by a [[Captain (association football)|captain]] who has only one official responsibility as mandated by the Laws of the Game: to represent his or her team in the coin toss prior to kick-off or [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty kicks]].&lt;ref name="laws51-52"/&gt;

The primary law is that players other than [[Goalkeeper (football)|goalkeepers]] may not deliberately handle the ball with their hands or arms during play, though they must use both their hands during a [[throw-in]] restart. Although players usually use their feet to move the ball around they may use any part of their body (notably, "heading" with the forehead)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://expertfootball.com/wp/heading/ |title=How to head a football |accessdate=3 January 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101215132821/http://expertfootball.com/training/heading.php| archivedate= 15 December 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; other than their hands or arms.&lt;ref name="fouls"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 12) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011115718/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws12_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within normal play, all players are free to play the ball in any direction and move throughout the pitch, though players may not pass to teammates who are in an [[Offside (association football)|offside]] position.&lt;ref name="offsidelaw"&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 11&amp;nbsp;– Offside |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:20121209 PSG-Juvisy - Kenza Dali 04.jpg|thumb|A player executing a slide [[Tackle (football move)|tackle]] to dispossess an opponent]]
During gameplay, players attempt to create goal-scoring opportunities through individual control of the ball, such as by [[dribbling]], passing the ball to a teammate, and by taking shots at the goal, which is guarded by the opposing goalkeeper. Opposing players may try to regain control of the ball by intercepting a pass or through [[Tackle (football move)#Association football|tackling]] the opponent in possession of the ball; however, physical contact between opponents is restricted. Football is generally a free-flowing game, with play stopping only when the ball has left the field of play or when play is stopped by the [[Referee (association football)|referee]] for an infringement of the rules. After a stoppage, play recommences with a specified restart.&lt;ref name="restart"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 8) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142456/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws8_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a professional level, most matches produce only a few goals. For example, the [[FA Premier League 2005-06|2005–06 season]] of the English [[Premier League]] produced an average of 2.48 goals per match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=England Premiership (2005/2006) |work=''Sportpress.com'' |url=http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927023234/http://www.sportpress.com/stats/en/738_england_premiership_2005_2006/11_league_summary.html |archivedate=27 September 2007 |accessdate=5 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Laws of the Game do not specify any player positions other than goalkeeper,&lt;ref name=LAW301&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Number of Players) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142527/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but a number of [[association football positions|specialised roles]] have evolved. Broadly, these include three main categories: [[Striker (association football)|strikers]], or forwards, whose main task is to score goals; [[Defender (association football)|defenders]], who specialise in preventing their opponents from scoring; and [[midfielder]]s, who dispossess the opposition and keep possession of the ball to pass it to the forwards on their team. Players in these positions are referred to as outfield players, to distinguish them from the goalkeeper. These positions are further subdivided according to the area of the field in which the player spends most time. For example, there are central defenders, and left and right midfielders. The ten outfield players may be arranged in any combination. The number of players in each position determines the style of the team's play; more forwards and fewer defenders creates a more aggressive and offensive-minded game, while the reverse creates a slower, more defensive style of play. While players typically spend most of the game in a specific position, there are few restrictions on player movement, and players can switch positions at any time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm |title=Positions guide, Who is in a team? |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=24 September 2007 | date=1 September 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061105213730/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4196830.stm| archivedate=5 November 2006| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The layout of a team's players is known as a ''[[Formation (association football)|formation]]''.

==Laws==
{{redirects here|Rules of football|the rules of other football games|Football}}
{{main|Laws of the Game (association football)}}
There are 17 laws in the official Laws of the Game, each containing a collection of stipulation and guidelines. The same laws are designed to apply to all levels of football, although certain modifications for groups such as juniors, seniors, women and people with physical disabilities are permitted. The laws are often framed in broad terms, which allow flexibility in their application depending on the nature of the game. The Laws of the Game are published by FIFA, but are maintained by the [[International Football Association Board]] (IFAB).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| title=Laws of the Game |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=2 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070901044035/http://fifa.com/worldfootball/lawsofthegame.html| archivedate= 1 September 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the seventeen laws, numerous IFAB decisions and other directives contribute to the regulation of football.

===Players, equipment, and officials===
{{See also|Association football positions|Formation (association football)|Kit (association football)}}
[[File:Howard Webb3.jpg|thumb|The [[referee (association football)|referee]] officiates in a football match]]
Each team consists of a maximum of eleven players (excluding [[substitute (association football)|substitutes]]), one of whom must be the [[goalkeeper (football)|goalkeeper]]. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven. Goalkeepers are the only players allowed to play the ball with their hands or arms, provided they do so within the [[penalty area]] in front of their own goal. Though there are a variety of [[association football positions|positions]] in which the outfield (non-goalkeeper) players are strategically placed by a coach, these positions are not defined or required by the Laws.&lt;ref name=LAW301/&gt;

The basic equipment or ''[[Kit (association football)|kit]]'' players are required to wear includes a shirt, shorts, socks, footwear and adequate [[shin guard]]s. An [[jockstrap|athletic supporter]] and protective cup is highly recommended for male players by medical experts and professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strikingeagles.tripod.com/health_advice_for_boys.htm |title=Health Advice for Boys |publisher=Strikingeagles.tripod.com |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://files.leagueathletics.com/Images/Club/6097/The%20Prevention%20of%20injuries.pdf |title=Soccer Position Paper |format=PDF |accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association football headgear|Headgear]] is not a required piece of basic equipment, but players today may choose to wear it to protect themselves from head injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football's biggest headache|url=http://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2017/03/12/58c54bab268e3e64368b45a8.html|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=Marca|location=Spain|date=12 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are forbidden to wear or use anything that is dangerous to themselves or another player, such as jewellery or watches. The goalkeeper must wear clothing that is easily distinguishable from that worn by the other players and the match officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 4–Players' Equipment) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141601/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws4_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of players may be replaced by substitutes during the course of the game. The maximum number of substitutions permitted in most competitive international and domestic league games is three in ninety minutes with each team being allowed one more if the game should go into extra-time, though the permitted number may vary in other competitions or in [[exhibition game|friendly matches]]. Common reasons for a substitution include injury, tiredness, ineffectiveness, a tactical switch, or [[timewasting]] at the end of a finely poised game. In standard adult matches, a player who has been substituted may not take further part in a match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 3–Substitution procedure) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144947/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws3_02.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; IFAB recommends "that a match should not continue if there are fewer than seven players in either team." Any decision regarding points awarded for abandoned games is left to the individual football associations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 3&amp;nbsp;– The Number of Players |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Match officials}}
A game is officiated by a [[referee (association football)|referee]], who has "full authority to enforce the Laws of the Game in connection with the match to which he has been appointed" (Law 5), and whose decisions are final. The referee is assisted by two [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referees]]. In many high-level games there is also a [[fourth official]] who assists the referee and may replace another official should the need arise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 5–The referee) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141909/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws5_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Goal line technology]] is used to measure if the whole ball has crossed the goal-line thereby determining if a goal has or hasn't been scored, this was brought in to prevent there being controversy. [[Video assistant referee]] (VAR) has also been increasingly introduced to assist officials through video replay to correct clear and obvious mistakes. There are four types of calls that can be reviewed: mistaken identity in awarding a red or yellow card, goals and whether there was a violation during the buildup, direct red card decisions, and penalty decisions.&lt;ref name="protocol"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.knvb.nl/downloads/bestand/9844/var-handbook-summary |title=Video Assistant Referees (VARs) Experiment – Protocol (Summary) |publisher=[[International Football Association Board]] |date=26 April 2017 |accessdate=26 April 2017 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ball===
{{main|Ball (association football)}}

The ball is spherical with a circumference of between {{convert|68|and|70|cm|in}}, a weight in the range of {{convert|410|to|450|g|oz}}, and a pressure between {{convert|8.5|and|15.6|psi|bar|1|order=flip|lk=on|abbr=off}} &lt;!-- rounding and flipped to get the values to equal FIFA's --&gt; at sea level. In the past the ball was made up of leather panels sewn together, with a latex bladder for pressurisation but modern balls at all levels of the game are now synthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laws of the Game 2013/2014|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/footballdevelopment/refereeing/81/42/36/log2013en%5fneutral.pdf|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Football-facts/Football-manufacturing/|title=Football manufacturing|work=FIFA quality program|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=3 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160904193101/http://quality.fifa.com/en/Footballs/Football-facts/Football-manufacturing|archivedate=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pitch===
{{Main|Football pitch}}
[[File:Football pitch metric.svg|thumb|Standard pitch measurements ([[:File:Football pitch imperial.svg|See Imperial version]])]]
As the Laws were formulated in England, and were initially administered solely by the four British football associations within [[IFAB]], the standard dimensions of a football pitch were originally expressed in [[imperial units]]. The Laws now express dimensions with approximate [[SI|metric]] equivalents (followed by traditional units in brackets), though use of imperial units remains popular in English-speaking countries with a relatively recent history of [[metrication]] (or only partial metrication), such as Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Will we ever go completely metric? |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/3934353.stm |date=2 September 2004 |last=Summers |first=Chris |accessdate=7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071010064850/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/3934353.stm| archivedate= 10 October 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The length of the pitch, or field, for international adult matches is in the range of 100–110&amp;nbsp;m (110–120&amp;nbsp;yd) and the width is in the range of 64–75&amp;nbsp;m (70–80&amp;nbsp;yd). Fields for non-international matches may be 90–120&amp;nbsp;m (100–130&amp;nbsp;yd) length and 45–90&amp;nbsp;m (50–100&amp;nbsp;yd) in width, provided that the pitch does not become square. In 2008, the IFAB initially approved a fixed size of 105&amp;nbsp;m (344&amp;nbsp;ft) long and 68&amp;nbsp;m (223&amp;nbsp;ft) wide as a standard pitch dimension for international matches;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/media/news/newsid=707751/|title=Goal-line technology put on ice |publisher=FIFA |date=8 March 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- ref for last sentence only --&gt; however, this decision was later put on hold and was never actually implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/administration/77/82/55/circularno.1145-amendmentstothelawsofthegame-2008.pdf |title=FIFA Amendments to the Laws of the Game, 2008 |publisher=FIFA |format=PDF |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longer boundary lines are ''touchlines'', while the shorter boundaries (on which the goals are placed) are ''goal lines''. A rectangular goal is positioned at the middle of each goal line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.1–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142202/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_01.htm| archivedate = 13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inner edges of the vertical goal posts must be {{convert|24|ft|m}} apart, and the lower edge of the horizontal crossbar supported by the goal posts must be {{convert|8|ft|m}} above the ground. Nets are usually placed behind the goal, but are not required by the Laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.4–The Field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144942/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_04.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In front of the goal is the penalty area. This area is marked by the goal line, two lines starting on the goal line 16.5&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;yd) from the goalposts and extending 16.5&amp;nbsp;m (18&amp;nbsp;yd) into the pitch perpendicular to the goal line, and a line joining them. This area has a number of functions, the most prominent being to mark where the goalkeeper may handle the ball and where a penalty foul by a member of the defending team becomes punishable by a penalty kick. Other markings define the position of the ball or players at [[Kick-off (association football)|kick-offs]], goal kicks, penalty kicks and corner kicks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 1.3–The field of play) |accessdate=24 September 2007| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071011084145/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws1_03.htm| archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration and tie-breaking methods===
A standard adult football match consists of two halves of 45 minutes each. Each half runs continuously, meaning that the clock is not stopped when the ball is out of play. There is usually a 15-minute half-time break between halves. The end of the match is known as full-time.&lt;ref name="rule7.2"/&gt; The referee is the official timekeeper for the match, and may make an allowance for time lost through substitutions, injured players requiring attention, or other stoppages. This added time is called ''additional time'' in FIFA documents,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120721055324/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/worldfootball/clubfootball/01/37/04/23/interpretation_law07_en.pdf|archivedate=21 July 2012|title=Interpretation of the Laws of the Game&amp;nbsp;– Law 07|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/afdeveloping/refereeing/law_7_the_duration_of_the_match_en_47401.pdf|title=Law 7 - The Duration of the Match|publisher=FIFA}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is most commonly referred to as ''stoppage time'' or ''injury time'', while ''lost time'' can also be used as a synonym. The duration of stoppage time is at the sole discretion of the referee. Stoppage time does not fully compensate for the time in which the ball is [[Ball in and out of play|out of play]], and a 90-minute game typically involves about an hour of "effective playing time".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football reforms: Scrapping 45-minute half to be debated at Ifab|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40311889|accessdate=7 March 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=18 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee alone signals the end of the match. In matches where a fourth official is appointed, towards the end of the half the referee signals how many minutes of stoppage time he intends to add. The fourth official then informs the players and spectators by holding up a board showing this number. The signalled stoppage time may be further extended by the referee.&lt;ref name="rule7.2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.2–The duration of the match) |accessdate=24 September 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011144952/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_02.htm |archivedate=11 October 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Added time was introduced because of an incident which happened in 1891 during a match between [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] and [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]. Trailing 1–0 and with just two minutes remaining, Stoke were awarded a penalty. Villa's goalkeeper kicked the ball out of the ground, and by the time the ball had been recovered, the 90&amp;nbsp;minutes had elapsed and the game was over.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Sunday Times]] ''Illustrated History of Football'' Reed International Books Limited 1996. p.11 {{ISBN|1-85613-341-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same law also states that the duration of either half is extended until the penalty kick to be taken or retaken is completed, thus no game shall end with a penalty to be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_03.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019042952/http://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws7_03.htm |archivedate=19 October 2007 |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 7.3–The duration of the match) |accessdate=3 March 2010 |dead-url=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Didier Drogba Manuel Neuer last penalty kick Champions League Final 2012.jpg|thumb|Some football competitions use a [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] to decide the winner if a match ends as a draw]]
In league competitions, games may end in a draw. In knockout competitions where a winner is required various methods may be employed to break such a deadlock; some competitions may invoke [[Replay (sports)|replays]].&lt;ref&gt;For example in the [[FA Cup]] prior to the semi-finals.&lt;/ref&gt; A game tied at the end of regulation time may go into extra time, which consists of two further 15-minute periods. If the score is still tied after extra time, some competitions allow the use of [[penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootouts]] (known officially in the Laws of the Game as "kicks from the penalty mark") to determine which team will progress to the next stage of the tournament. Goals scored during extra time periods count towards the final score of the game, but kicks from the penalty mark are only used to decide the team that progresses to the next part of the tournament (with goals scored in a penalty shootout not making up part of the final score).&lt;ref name="laws51-52"&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Procedures to determine the winner of a match or home-and-away |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In competitions using [[two-legged match]]es, each team competes at home once, with an aggregate score from the two matches deciding which team progresses. Where aggregates are equal, the [[away goals rule]] may be used to determine the winners, in which case the winner is the team that scored the most goals in the leg they played away from home. If the result is still equal, extra time and potentially a penalty shootout are required.&lt;ref name="laws51-52"/&gt;

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the [[IFAB]] experimented with ways of creating a winner without requiring a penalty shootout, which was often seen as an undesirable way to end a match. These involved rules ending a game in extra time early, either when the first goal in extra time was scored (''[[golden goal]]''), or if one team held a lead at the end of the first period of extra time (''[[silver goal]]''). Golden goal was used at the World Cup in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. The first World Cup game decided by a golden goal was [[France national football team|France]]'s victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] in 1998. [[Germany national football team|Germany]] was the first nation to score a golden goal in a major competition, beating [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] in the final of [[Euro 1996]]. Silver goal was used in [[Euro 2004]]. Both these experiments have been discontinued by IFAB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Time running out for silver goal |publisher=Rediff.com |agency=Reuters | url = http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm | last=Collett |first=Mike | date = 2 July 2004 | accessdate =7 October 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071102232630/http://www.rediff.com/sports/2004/jul/02silver.htm| archivedate= 2 November 2007 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ball in and out of play===
{{Main|Ball in and out of play}}

Under the Laws, the two basic states of play during a game are ''ball in play'' and ''ball out of play''. From the beginning of each [[playing period]] with a kick-off until the end of the playing period, the ball is in play at all times, except when either the ball leaves the field of play, or play is stopped by the referee. When the ball becomes out of play, play is restarted by one of eight restart methods depending on how it went out of play:
[[File:Shunsuke1 20080622.jpg|thumb|right|A player takes a free kick, while the opposition form a "wall" to try to block the ball]]
* [[Kick-off (association football)|Kick-off]]: following a goal by the opposing team, or to begin each period of play.&lt;ref name="restart"/&gt;
* [[Throw-in]]: when the ball has crossed the touchline; awarded to the opposing team to that which last touched the ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 15–The Throw-in) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142556/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws15_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Goal kick]]: when the ball has wholly crossed the goal line without a goal having been scored and having last been touched by a player of the attacking team; awarded to defending team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 16–The Goal Kick) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913141725/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws16_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Indirect free kick]]: awarded to the opposing team following "non-penal" fouls, certain technical infringements, or when play is stopped to caution or dismiss an opponent without a specific foul having occurred. A goal may not be scored directly (without the ball first touching another player) from an indirect free kick.&lt;ref name="freekick"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 13–Free Kicks) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142645/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws13_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Direct free kick]]: awarded to fouled team following certain listed "penal" fouls.&lt;ref name="freekick"/&gt; A goal may be scored directly from a direct free kick.
* [[Penalty kick (association football)|Penalty kick]]: awarded to the fouled team following a foul usually punishable by a direct free kick but that has occurred within their opponent's penalty area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |publisher=FIFA |title=Laws of the game (Law 14–The Penalty Kick) |accessdate=14 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913142717/http://fifa.com/flash/lotg/football/en/Laws14_01.htm |archivedate=13 September 2007 |deadurl=no  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dropped-ball]]: occurs when the referee has stopped play for any other reason, such as a serious injury to a player, interference by an external party, or a ball becoming defective.&lt;ref name="restart"/&gt;

===Misconduct===
{{main|Foul (association football)}}

====On-field====
{{double image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Players are cautioned with a yellow card, and dismissed from the game with a red card. These colours were first introduced at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]] and used consistently since.}}
A [[foul (football)|foul]] occurs when a player commits an offence listed in the Laws of the Game while the ball is in play. The offences that constitute a foul are listed in Law 12. Handling the ball deliberately, tripping an opponent, or pushing an opponent, are examples of "penal fouls", punishable by a [[direct free kick]] or penalty kick depending on where the offence occurred. Other fouls are punishable by an [[indirect free kick]].&lt;ref name="fouls"/&gt;

The referee may punish a player's or substitute's [[misconduct (football)|misconduct]] by a caution ([[Penalty card|yellow card]]) or dismissal ([[Penalty card|red card]]). A second yellow card in the same game leads to a red card, which results in a dismissal. A player given a yellow card is said to have been "booked", the referee writing the player's name in his official notebook. If a player has been dismissed, no substitute can be brought on in their place and the player may not participate in further play. Misconduct may occur at any time, and while the offences that constitute misconduct are listed, the definitions are broad. In particular, the offence of "unsporting behaviour" may be used to deal with most events that violate the spirit of the game, even if they are not listed as specific offences. A referee can show a yellow or red card to a player, substitute or substituted player. Non-players such as managers and support staff cannot be shown the yellow or red card, but may be expelled from the technical area if they fail to conduct themselves in a responsible manner.&lt;ref name="fouls"/&gt;

Rather than stopping play, the referee may allow play to continue if doing so will benefit the team against which an offence has been committed. This is known as "playing an advantage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4188646.stm |title=Referee's signals: advantage |work=BBC Sport |accessdate=4 March 2011 |date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The referee may "call back" play and penalise the original offence if the anticipated advantage does not ensue within "a few seconds". Even if an offence is not penalised due to advantage being played, the offender may still be sanctioned for misconduct at the next stoppage of play.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Laws of the Game 2010/2011 |chapter=Law 5: The Referee: Advantage |url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2010_11_e.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011 |page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The referee's decision in all on-pitch matters is considered final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Laws of the Game |chapter=Law 5: The Referee|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/affederation/generic/81/42/36/lawsofthegame_2011_12_en.pdf |format=PDF |authorlink=International Football Association Board |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=5 May 2012 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The score of a match cannot be altered after the game, even if later evidence shows that decisions (including awards/non-awards of goals) were incorrect.

====Off-field====
{{see also|Foul (association football)#Post-match}}
Along with the general administration of the sport, football associations and competition organisers also enforce good conduct in wider aspects of the game, dealing with issues such as comments to the press, clubs' financial management, [[Doping in sport|doping]], [[Age fraud in association football|age fraud]] and [[match fixing]]. Most competitions enforce mandatory suspensions for players who are sent off in a game.&lt;ref name=FAsuspensions&gt;For example, see [[The Football Association]]'s rules regarding player suspensions in FA competitions: {{cite web|title=DISCIPLINARY PROCEDURES|url=http://www.thefa.com/~/media/files/thefaportal/governance-docs/rules-of-the-association/2015-16/031g_memorandum-of-disciplinary-procedures-_section-d.ashx |publisher=The Football Association|accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some on-field incidents, if considered very serious (such as allegations of racial abuse), may result in competitions deciding to impose heavier sanctions than those normally associated with a red card.{{efn|For example, the [[English Premier League]] fined and levied an 8-match suspension on [[Luis Suárez]] for [[Luis Suárez#Racial abuse incident|racially abusing]] [[Patrice Evra]]}} Some associations allow for appeals against player suspensions incurred on-field if clubs feel a referee was incorrect or unduly harsh.&lt;ref name=FAsuspensions/&gt;

Sanctions for such infractions may be levied on individuals or on to clubs as a whole. Penalties may include fines, points deductions (in league competitions) or even expulsion from competitions. For example, the [[English Football League]]  deduct 12 points from any team that enters [[Administration (British football)|financial administration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Football League administration penalty raised to 12 points|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/33027933|accessdate=17 May 2018|publisher=BBC Sport|date=5 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other administrative sanctions are penalties against game forfeiture. Teams that had forfeited a game or had been forfeited against would be awarded a technical loss or win.

==Governing bodies==
{{See also|Association football around the world}}
[[File:FIFA-Headquarter.jpg|thumb| Headquarters of [[FIFA]], the world governing body of football]]
The recognised international governing body of football (and associated games, such as [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]]) is [[FIFA]]. The FIFA headquarters are located in [[Zürich]], Switzerland. Six regional confederations are associated with FIFA; these are:&lt;ref name="confeds"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/confederations/ |title=Confederations |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Asia: [[Asian Football Confederation]] (AFC)
* Africa: [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF)
* Europe: [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations]] (UEFA)
* North/Central America &amp; Caribbean: [[CONCACAF|Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football]] (CONCACAF)
* Oceania: [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC)
* South America: [[CONMEBOL|Confederación Sudamericana de Fútbol/Confederação Sul-americana de Futebol]] (South American Football Confederation; CONMEBOL)

National associations oversee football within individual countries. These are generally synonymous with sovereign states, (for example: the [[Fédération Camerounaise de Football]] in Cameroon) but also include a smaller number of associations responsible for sub-national entities or autonomous regions (for example the [[Scottish Football Association]] in Scotland). 209 national associations are affiliated both with FIFA and with their respective continental confederations.&lt;ref name="confeds"/&gt;

While FIFA is responsible for arranging competitions and most rules related to international competition, the actual Laws of the Game are set by the [[International Football Association Board]], where each of the UK Associations has one vote, while FIFA collectively has four votes.&lt;ref name="IFAB works"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/ifab/aboutifab.html |title=The IFAB: How it works |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International competitions==

The major international competition in football is the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], organised by FIFA. This competition takes place every four years since [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930]] with the exception of 1942 and 1946 tournaments, which were cancelled due to [[World War II]]. Approximately 190–200 national teams compete in qualifying tournaments within the scope of continental confederations for a place in the finals. The finals tournament, which is held every four years, involves 32 national teams competing over a four-week period.{{efn|The number of competing teams has varied over the history of the competition. The most recent changed was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], from 24 to 32.}} The World Cup is the most prestigious association football tournament in the world as well as the most widely viewed and followed sporting event in the world, exceeding even the [[Olympic Games]]; the cumulative audience of all matches of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] was estimated to be 26.29 billion with an estimated 715.1 million people watching the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|final match]], a ninth of the entire population of the planet.&lt;ref name="2006coverage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/marketing/news/newsid=111247/index.html |title=2006 FIFA World Cup broadcast wider, longer and farther than ever before |publisher=FIFA |date=6 February 2007 |accessdate=11 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tom Dunmore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9j1wbp2t1usC&amp;pg=PA235#v=onepage Historical Dictionary of Soccer], page 235, quote "The World Cup is now the most-watched sporting event in the world on television, above even the Olympic Games."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Dobson and John Goddard, [https://books.google.com/books?id=GxyG0XXdvR4C&amp;pg=PA407#v=onepage The Economics of Football], page 407, quote "The World Cup is the most widely viewed sporting event in the world: the estimated cumulative television audience for the 2006 World Cup in Germany was 26.2 billion, an average of 409 million viewers per match."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Glenn M.

[[FIFA Women's World Cup]] has been held every four years since [[1991 FIFA Women's World Cup|1991]]. Under the tournament's current format, national teams vie for 23 slots in a three-year [[FIFA Women's World Cup qualification|qualification phase]]. (The host nation's team is automatically entered as the 24th slot.) The current champion is the [[United States women's national soccer team|United States]], after winning their third title in the [[2015 FIFA Women's World Cup]].

There has been a [[Football at the Summer Olympics|football tournament]] at every Summer Olympic Games since [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900]], except at the 1932 games in [[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.olympic.org/football-equipment-and-history?tab=1 |title=Football Equipment and History |publisher=International Olympic Committee (IOC) |accessdate=4 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the inception of the World Cup, the Olympics (especially during the 1920s) were the most prestigious international event. Originally, the tournament was for amateurs only.&lt;ref name=Wherebegan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0,3504,4,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608215029/http://access.fifa.com/en/history/history/0%2C3504%2C4%2C00.html |archivedate=8 June 2007 |title=Where it all began |publisher=FIFA |accessdate=8 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As professionalism spread around the world, the gap in quality between the World Cup and the Olympics widened. The countries that benefited most were the [[Soviet Bloc]] countries of [[Eastern Europe]], where top athletes were state-sponsored while retaining their status as amateurs. Between [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] and [[1980 Summer Olympics|1980]], 23 out of 27 Olympic medals were won by Eastern Europe, with only [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] (gold in 1948 and bronze in 1952), [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] (bronze in 1948 and silver in 1960) and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] (bronze in 1968) breaking their dominance. For the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Los Angeles Games]], the [[IOC]] decided to admit professional players. [[FIFA]] still did not want the Olympics to rival the World Cup, so a compromise was struck that allowed teams from Africa, Asia, Oceania and [[CONCACAF]] to field their strongest professional sides, while restricting [[UEFA]] and [[CONMEBOL]] teams to players who had not played in a World Cup. Since [[1992 Summer Olympics|1992]] male competitors must be under 23 years old, and since [[1996 Summer Olympics|1996]], players under 23 years old, with three over-23 year old players, are allowed per squad. A women's tournament was added in 1996; in contrast to the men's event, full international sides without age restrictions play the women's Olympic tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://olympics.sportinglife.com/olympics/story/0,23911,14986,00.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430181217/http://olympics.sportinglife.com/olympics/story/0%2C23911%2C14986%2C00.html |archivedate=30 April 2011 |title=Event Guide&amp;nbsp;– Football |work=sportinglife |publisher=365 media group |accessdate=5 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the World Cup, the most important international football competitions are the continental championships, which are organised by each continental confederation and contested between national teams. These are the [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] (UEFA), the [[Copa América]] (CONMEBOL), [[African Cup of Nations]] (CAF), the [[Asian Cup]] (AFC), the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] (CONCACAF) and the [[OFC Nations Cup]] (OFC). The [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] is contested by the winners of all six continental championships, the current [[FIFA World Cup]] champions and the country which is hosting the Confederations Cup. This is generally regarded as a warm-up tournament for the upcoming FIFA World Cup and does not carry the same prestige as the World Cup itself. The most prestigious competitions in club football are the respective continental championships, which are generally contested between national champions, for example the [[UEFA Champions League]] in Europe and the [[Copa Libertadores]] in South America. The winners of each continental competition contest the [[FIFA Club World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Organising Committee strengthens FIFA Club World Cup format |publisher=FIFA |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid=570740.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531094715/http://www.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/clubworldcup/japan2007/releases/newsid%3D570740.html |archivedate=31 May 2008 |date=14 August 2007 |accessdate=7 October 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic competitions==
{{Main|Geography of association football|Geography of women's association football}}
[[File:David Villa in Clasico.jpg|thumb|upright|A 2011 Spanish [[La Liga]] match between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]]. This fixture, known as ''[[El Clásico]]'', is one of the most renowned in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMahon|first1=Bobby|title=El Clásico Is A Must-See Game, But Is Its Global Audience Overstated?|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobbymcmahon/2017/12/21/el-clasico-is-a-not-to-be-missed-game-but-dont-believe-the-viewing-figures-youre-told/|accessdate=17 May 2018|work=Forbes|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The governing bodies in each country operate [[league system]]s in a [[Domestic association football season|domestic season]], normally comprising several [[division (sport)|divisions]], in which the teams gain points throughout the season depending on results. Teams are placed into [[Table (information)|tables]], placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a [[round-robin tournament]]. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be [[promotion and relegation|promoted]] to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are [[promotion and relegation|relegated]] to a lower division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Scottish Journal of Political Economy |last=Fort |first=Rodney |date=September 2000 |volume=47 |issue=4 |pages=431–455 |doi=10.1111/1467-9485.00172 |journal=Scottish Journal of Political Economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teams finishing at the top of a country's league may be eligible also to play in [[List of association football competitions|international club competitions]] in the following season. The main exceptions to this system occur in some Latin American leagues, which divide football championships into two sections named [[Apertura and Clausura]] (Spanish for ''Opening'' and ''Closing''), awarding a champion for each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/latinamerica/story/Estudiantes-win-Argentina-Apertura-title |title=Estudiantes win Argentina Apertura title |date=13 December 2010 |publisher=Fox Sports |agency=Associated Press |quote=Under the system used in Argentina and most of Latin America, two season titles are awarded each year&amp;nbsp;– the Apertura and Clausura.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of countries supplement the league system with one or more "cup" competitions organised on a [[single elimination tournament|knock-out]] basis.

Some countries' top divisions feature highly paid star players; in smaller countries, lower divisions, and most of women's clubs, players may be part-timers with a second job, or amateurs. The five top European leagues&amp;nbsp;– the [[Bundesliga]] (Germany), [[Premier League]] (England),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7321408.stm |work=BBC Sport |title= Premier League conquering Europe |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2008 | first=Ian | last=Hughes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[La Liga]] (Spain), [[Serie A]] (Italy), and [[Ligue 1]] (France)&amp;nbsp;– attract most of the world's best players and each of the leagues has a total wage cost in excess of £600 million/€763 million/US$1.185 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Louise |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/may/29/premierleague |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Leading clubs losing out as players and agents cash in |date=29 May 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants and casual play==
{{see also|Variants of association football|Street football}}
[[File:O Jogo Bonito (The Beautiful Game).webm|thumb|To many, football is more than just a sport: a video short on the many styles and ethnicities who play football.]]
Variants of football have been codified for reduced-sized teams (i.e. [[five-a-side football]]) play in non-field environments (i.e. [[beach soccer]], [[indoor soccer]], and [[futsal]]) and for teams with disabilities (i.e. [[paralympic association football]]).

[[Street football|Casual games]] can be played with only minimal equipment&amp;nbsp;– a basic game can be played on almost any open area of reasonable size with just a ball and items to mark the positions of two sets of goalposts. Such games can have team sizes that vary from eleven-a-side, can use a limited or modified subset of the official rules, and can be self-officiated by the players.

The '''Atmospheric Chemistry Suite''' ('''ACS''') is a science payload consisting of three [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared spectrometer]] channels abord the [[ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter]] (TGO) orbiting Mars since October 2016.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2014'&gt; ''Three infrared spectrometers, an atmospheric chemistry suite for the ExoMars 2016 Trace Gas Orbiter''. Korablev, O., et al., 2014. J. Appl. Remote Sensing. 8, 4983.&lt;/ref&gt;  The three channels are: the near-infrared channel ([[Near-infrared spectroscopy|NIR]]), the mid-infrared channel (MIR), and the far infrared channel (FIR, also called TIRVIM).

The ACS was proposed in 2011 by Russian Academy Section and eventually accepted by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) and [[Roscosmos]] as one of two Russian instruments onboard TGO. &lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'&gt; [http://www-mars.lmd.jussieu.fr/granada2017/abstracts/korablev_granada2017.pdf Science Investigations for the Atmospheric Chemistry Suite on ExoMars TGO]. (PDF) O. Korablev, N. I. Ignatiev, A. A. Fedorova, A. Yu. Trokhimovskiy, A. V. Grigoriev, A. V. Shakun, Space, F. Montmessin, F. Lefevre, F. Forget. ''Sixth International Workshop on the Mars Atmosphere: Modelling and Observations''. Granada, Spain 17-20 January 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The instrument was funded by Roscosmos and [[Centre national d'études spatiales]] (CNES) of France, and has components of both Russia and France. Its development and fabrication was under Russian leadership. The functionality of all the three channels was confirmed during cruise to Mars.

==Objectives==

The main objective of the ACS suite is to make an inventory and map minor atmospheric species or trace gases in the [[atmosphere of Mars]]. This will allow scientists to profile the upper limits on the [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|methane contents]], and to possibly to detect sulfur dioxide ([[Sulfur dioxide|{{chem|SO|2}}]]), a gas of volcanic origin.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt;

== Channels ==

The [[Near-infrared spectroscopy|near-infrared]] channel (NIR), is a compact spectrometer operating in the range of 0.7–1.7 μm
with a resolving power of λ/Δλ ~ 20,000 and with a spectral range of 10-20 nm. It is designed to operate in [[nadir]] and in  [[occultation|solar occultation]] modes.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt; 

The mid-infrared channel (MIR) is an [[Echelle grating|echelle]] spectrometer with crossed dispersion, designed exclusively
for solar occultation measurements in the 2.2–4.4 μm spectral range with a resolving power of approximately 50,000.&lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt;

The far-infrared channel covers the [[thermal infrared spectroscopy]]; it is a [[Planetary Fourier Spectrometer|Fourier spectrometer]] called the TIRVIM. It has an aperture of ~5 cm and it measures the spectrum of 1.7–17 μm. Its main task will be for temperature sounding of the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]] in the 15-μm {{chem|CO|2}} band. TIRVIM has 10 times higher
performances than the PFS spectrometer of [[Mars Express]] orbiter. &lt;ref name='Korablev 2016'/&gt;

==Methane==

{{main article|Atmosphere of Mars#Methane}}
Of particular interest to this astrobiology mission, is the detection and characterization of the [[Atmosphere of Mars#Methane|atmospheric methane]] ({{chem|CH|4}}), as it may be of geological or biological nature. Large differences in the abundances were measured between observations taken in 2003, 2006, and on 2014 NASA reported that the ''Curiosity'' rover detected a tenfold increase ('spike') in methane in the atmosphere in late 2013 and early 2014.  This suggestes that the methane was locally concentrated and is probably seasonal. Because methane on Mars would quickly break down due to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun and chemical reactions with other gases, its persistent presence in the atmosphere also implies the existence of an unknown source to continually replenish the gas.&lt;ref name='Webster 2015'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Mars methane detection and variability at Gale crater |journal=Science |date=23 January 2015 |last=Webster |first=Christopher R. |volume=347 |issue=6220 |pages=415–417 |doi=10.1126/science.1261713 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/347/6220/415.short |accessdate=2015-04-15 |bibcode = 2015Sci...347..415W |pmid=25515120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attachment in children''' is "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought when the child senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort".&lt;ref&gt;Prior &amp; Glaser (2006) Understanding Attachment and Attachment Disorders, London: JKP, p.17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bowlby |first1=J. |year=1960 |title=Separation Anxiety |journal=Int J Psychoanal |volume=41 |pages=89–113 |pmid=13803480}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=" Tronick et al."&gt;Tronick, Morelli, &amp; Ivey, 1992, p.568. "Until recently, scientific accounts ... of the infant's early social experiences converged on the view that the infant progresses from a primary relationship with one individual... to relationships with a growing number of people... This is an epigenetic, hierarchical view of social development. We have labeled this dominant view the continuous care and contact model (CCC...). The CCC model developed from the writings of [[René Spitz|Spitz]]..., [[John Bowlby|Bowlby]]..., and Provence and Lipton... on institutionalized children and is represented in the psychological views of Bowlby...[and others]. Common to the different conceptual frameworks is the belief that parenting practices and the infant's capacity for social engagement are biologically based and conform to a prototypical form. Supporters of the CCC model generally recognize that the infant and caregiver are able to adjust to a range of conditions, but they consider the adjustments observed to reflect biological variation. However, more extreme views (e.g., maternal bonding) consider certain variants as nonadaptive and as compromising the child's psychological development. Bowlby's concept of monotropism is an exemplar of the CCC perspective..." (Tronick, Morelli, &amp; Ivey, 1992, p. 568).&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment also describes the function of availability, which is the degree to which the authoritative figure is responsive to the child's needs and shares communication with them. Childhood attachment can define characteristics that will shape the child's sense of self, their forms of emotion-regulation, and how they carry out relationships with others.&lt;ref&gt;Kayastha, P. (2010). Security of attachment in children and adolescents. Bangalore: Elsevier B.V.&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment is found in all mammals to some degree, especially nonhuman primates.

Attachment theory has led to a new understanding of child development. Children develop different patterns of attachment based on experiences and interactions with their caregivers at a young age. Four different attachment classifications have been identified in children: [[secure attachment]], [[anxious-ambivalent attachment]], [[anxious-avoidant attachment]], and [[disorganized attachment]]. Attachment theory has become the dominant theory used today in the study of infant and toddler behavior and in the fields of infant mental health, treatment of children, and related fields.

== Attachment theory and children ==
{{Main|Attachment theory}}
Attachment theory ([[John Bowlby|Bowlby]] 1969, 1973, 1980) is rooted in the ethological notion that a newborn child is biologically programmed to seek proximity with caregivers, and this proximity-seeking behavior is naturally selected.&lt;ref name="Bowlby, J. 1969"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1969). Attachment and loss: Vol. I: Attachment. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby, J. 1973"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1973). Attachment and loss: Vol. II: Separation: Anxiety and anger.  New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bowlby, J. 1980"&gt;Bowlby, J. (1980). Attachment and loss: Vol. III: Loss. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Through repeated attempts to seek physical and emotional closeness with a caregiver and the responses the child gets, the child develops an internal working model (IWM) that reflects the response of the caregiver to the child. According to Bowlby, attachment provides a secure base from which the child can explore the environment, a haven of safety to which the child can return when he or she is afraid or fearful. Bowlby's colleague [[Mary Ainsworth]] identified that an important factor which determines whether a child will have a secure or insecure attachment is the degree of sensitivity shown by their caregiver:

The sensitive caregiver responds socially to attempts to initiate social interaction, playfully to his attempts to initiate play. She picks him up when he seems to wish it, and puts him down when he wants to explore. When he is distressed, she knows what kinds and degree of soothing he requires to comfort him – and she knows that sometimes a few words or a distraction will be all that is needed. On the other hand, the mother who responds inappropriately tries to socialize with the baby when he is hungry, play with him when he is tired, or feed him when he is trying to initiate social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M. D. S. (1969) Ainsworth maternal scales. Available at http://www.psychology.sunysb.edu/attachment/measures/content/ainsworth_scales.html&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it should be recognized that "even sensitive caregivers get it right only about 50 percent of the time. Their communications are either out of synch, or mismatched. There are times when parents feel tired or distracted. The telephone rings or there is breakfast to prepare. In other words, attuned interactions rupture quite frequently. But the hallmark of a sensitive caregiver is that the ruptures are managed and repaired."&lt;ref&gt;Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common and empirically supported method for assessing attachment in infants (12 months – 20 months) is the Strange Situation Protocol, developed by [[Mary Ainsworth]] as a result of her careful in-depth observations of infants with their mothers in Uganda(see below).&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S."&gt;Ainsworth, M.D.S., Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S. (1978).  Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation. Hillsdale, NJ: Earlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; The Strange Situation Protocol is a research, not a diagnostic, tool and the resulting attachment classifications are not 'clinical diagnoses.' While the procedure may be used to supplement clinical impressions, the resulting classifications should not be confused with the clinically diagnosed '[[Reactive Attachment Disorder]] (RAD).' The clinical concept of RAD differs in a number of fundamental ways from the theory and research driven attachment classifications based on the Strange Situation Procedure. The idea that insecure attachments are synonymous with RAD is, in fact, not accurate and leads to ambiguity when formally discussing attachment theory as it has evolved in the research literature. This is not to suggest that the concept of RAD is without merit, but rather that the clinical and research conceptualizations of insecure attachment and [[attachment disorder]] are not synonymous.

The 'Strange Situation' is a laboratory procedure used to assess infant patterns of attachment to their caregiver. In the procedure, the mother and infant are placed in an unfamiliar playroom equipped with toys while a researcher observes/records the procedure through a one-way mirror. The procedure consists of eight sequential episodes in which the child experiences both separation from and reunion with the mother as well as the presence of an unfamiliar stranger.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt; The protocol is conducted in the following format unless modifications are otherwise noted by a particular researcher:

*Episode 1: Mother (or other familiar caregiver), Baby, Experimenter (30 seconds)
*Episode 2: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 3: Mother, Baby, Stranger (3 mins or less)
*Episode 4: Stranger, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 5: Mother, Baby (3 mins)
*Episode 6: Baby Alone (3 mins or less)
*Episode 7: Stranger, Baby (3 mins or less)
*Episode 8: Mother, Baby (3 mins)

Mainly on the basis of their reunion behaviours (although other behaviours are taken into account) in the Strange Situation Paradigm (Ainsworth et al., 1978; see below), infants can be categorized into three 'organized' attachment categories: Secure (Group B); Avoidant (Group A); and Anxious/Resistant (Group C). There are subclassifications for each group (see below). A fourth category, termed Disorganized (D), can also be assigned to an infant assessed in the Strange Situation although a primary 'organized' classification is always given for an infant judged to be disorganized. Each of these groups reflects a different kind of attachment relationship with the mother. A child may have a different type of attachment to each parent as well as to unrelated caregivers. Attachment style is thus not so much a part of the child's thinking, but is characteristic of a specific relationship. However, after about age five the child exhibits one primary consistent pattern of attachment in relationships.&lt;ref&gt;J. Cassidy &amp; P. Shaver, (1999) Handbook of Attachment, NY:Guilford&lt;/ref&gt;

The pattern the child develops after age five demonstrates the specific parenting styles used during the developmental stages within the child. These attachment patterns are associated with behavioural patterns and can help further predict a child's future personality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Snyder |first1=R. |last2=Shapiro |first2=S. |last3=Treleaven |first3=D. |year=2012 |title=Attachment Theory and Mindfulness |journal=Journal of Child &amp; Family Studies |volume=21 |issue=5 |pages=709–717 |doi=10.1007/s10826-011-9522-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attachment patterns ==

"The strength of a child's attachment behaviour in a given circumstance does not indicate the 'strength' of the attachment bond. Some insecure children will routinely display very pronounced attachment behaviours, while many secure children find that there is no great need to engage in either intense or frequent shows of attachment behaviour".&lt;ref&gt;Howe, D. (2011) Attachment across the lifecourse, London: Palgrave, p.13&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Secure attachment ===
{{Main article|Secure attachment}}
A toddler who is securely attached to its parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status, however. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity to their needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond to their child's needs will create securely attached children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive to their needs and communications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel Schacter|Schacter, D.L.]] et al. (2009). Psychology, Second Edition. New York: Worth Publishers. pp.441&lt;/ref&gt;

In the traditional Ainsworth et al. (1978) coding of the Strange Situation, secure infants are denoted as "Group B" infants and they are further subclassified as B1, B2, B3, and B4.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt; Although these subgroupings refer to different stylistic responses to the comings and goings of the caregiver, they were not given specific labels by Ainsworth and colleagues, although their descriptive behaviours led others (including students of Ainsworth) to devise a relatively 'loose' terminology for these subgroups. B1's have been referred to as 'secure-reserved', B2's as 'secure-inhibited', B3's as 'secure-balanced,' and B4's as 'secure-reactive.' In academic publications however, the classification of infants (if subgroups are denoted) is typically simply "B1" or "B2" although more theoretical and review-oriented papers surrounding attachment theory may use the above terminology.

Securely attached children are best able to explore when they have the knowledge of a secure base to return to in times of need. When assistance is given, this bolsters the sense of security and also, assuming the parent's assistance is helpful, educates the child in how to cope with the same problem in the future. Therefore, secure attachment can be seen as the most adaptive attachment style. According to some psychological researchers, a child becomes securely attached when the parent is available and able to meet the needs of the child in a responsive and appropriate manner. At infancy and early childhood, if parents are caring and attentive towards their children, those children will be more prone to secure attachment.&lt;ref name="Aronoff, J. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aronoff |first1=J |year=2012 |title=Parental Nurturance in the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample: Theory, Coding, and Scores |journal=Cross-Cultural Research |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=315–347 |doi=10.1177/1069397112450851}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anxious-resistant insecure attachment ===
{{Main article|Anxious-ambivalent attachment}}
Anxious-resistant insecure attachment is also called '''ambivalent attachment'''.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth,1978a"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Ainsworth MD, Blehar M, Waters E, Wall S |year=1978 |title=Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation |publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates |location=Hillsdale NJ |isbn=0-89859-461-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, a child with an anxious-resistant attachment style will typically explore little (in the Strange Situation) and is often wary of strangers, even when the caregiver is present. When the caregiver departs, the child is often highly distressed. The child is generally ambivalent when they return.&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt; The Anxious-Ambivalent/Resistant strategy is a response to unpredictably responsive caregiving, and that the displays of anger or helplessness towards the caregiver on reunion can be regarded as a conditional strategy for maintaining the availability of the caregiver by preemptively taking control of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Solomon | first1 = J. | last2 = George | first2 = C. | last3 = De Jong | first3 = A. | year = 1995 | title = Children classified as controlling at age six: Evidence of disorganized representational strategies and aggression at home and at school | url = | journal = Development and Psychopathology | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 447–447 | doi=10.1017/s0954579400006623}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 145-171&lt;/ref&gt;

The C1 subtype is coded when:

''"...resistant behavior is particularly conspicuous. The mixture of seeking and yet resisting contact and interaction has an unmistakably angry quality and indeed an angry tone may characterize behavior in the preseparation episodes..."''&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

The C2 subtype is coded when:

''"Perhaps the most conspicuous characteristic of C2 infants is their passivity. Their exploratory behavior is limited throughout the SS and their interactive behaviors are relatively lacking in active initiation. Nevertheless, in the reunion episodes they obviously want proximity to and contact with their mothers, even though they tend to use signalling rather than active approach, and protest against being put down rather than actively resisting release...In general the C2 baby is not as conspicuously angry as the C1 baby."''&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

=== Anxious-avoidant insecure attachment ===
{{Main article|Anxious-avoidant attachment}}
A child with the anxious-avoidant insecure attachment style will avoid or ignore the caregiver – showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The child will not explore very much regardless of who is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency to approach together with some tendency to ignore or turn away from the caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorised that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants is in fact as a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ainsworth |first1=MD |last2=Bell |first2=SM |year=1970 |title=Attachment, exploration, and separation: Illustrated by the behavior of one-year-olds in a strange situation |journal=Child Dev |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=49–67 |pmid=5490680 |doi=10.2307/1127388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sroufe |first1=A. |last2=Waters |first2=E. |year=1977 |title=Attachment as an Organizational Construct |journal=Child Dev |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=1184–1199 |jstor=1128475 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.1977.tb03922.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants are depicted as anxious-avoidant insecure when there is:

''"...conspicuous avoidance of the mother in the reunion episodes which is likely to consist of ignoring her altogether, although there may be some pointed looking away, turning away, or moving away...If there is a greeting when the mother enters, it tends to be a mere look or a smile...Either the baby does not approach his mother upon reunion, or they approach in 'abortive' fashions with the baby going past the mother, or it tends to only occur after much coaxing...If picked up, the baby shows little or no contact-maintaining behavior; he tends not to cuddle in; he looks away and he may squirm to get down."''&lt;ref name="Ainsworth, M.D.S, Blehar, M. C., Waters, E., &amp; Wall, S." /&gt;

Ainsworth's narrative records showed that infants avoided the caregiver in the stressful Strange Situation Procedure when they had a history of experiencing rebuff of attachment behaviour. The child's needs are frequently not met and the child comes to believe that communication of needs has no influence on the caregiver. Ainsworth's student [[Mary Main]] theorised that avoidant behaviour in the Strange Situational Procedure should be regarded as 'a conditional strategy, which paradoxically permits whatever proximity is possible under conditions of maternal rejection' by de-emphasising attachment needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Main | first1 = M | year = 1979 | title = The "ultimate" causation of some infant attachment phenomena | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 640–643 | doi=10.1017/s0140525x00064992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Main proposed that avoidance has two functions for an infant whose caregiver is consistently unresponsive to their needs. Firstly, avoidant behaviour allows the infant to maintain a conditional proximity with the caregiver: close enough to maintain protection, but distant enough to avoid rebuff. Secondly, the cognitive processes organising avoidant behaviour could help direct attention away from the unfulfilled desire for closeness with the caregiver – avoiding a situation in which the child is overwhelmed with emotion ('disorganised distress'), and therefore unable to maintain control of themselves and achieve even conditional proximity.&lt;ref&gt;Main, M. (1977a) Analysis of a peculiar form of reunion behaviour seen in some day-care children. In R. Webb (ed.) Social Development in Childhood (pp.33-78), Baltimore: Johns Hopkins&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disorganized/disoriented attachment ===
{{Main article|Disorganized attachment}}
Ainsworth herself was the first to find difficulties in fitting all infant behaviour into the three classifications used in her Baltimore study. Ainsworth and colleagues sometimes observed 'tense movements such as hunching the shoulders, putting the hands behind the neck and tensely cocking the head, and so on. It was our clear impression that such tension movements signified stress, both because they tended to occur chiefly in the separation episodes and because they tended to be prodromal to crying. Indeed, our hypothesis is that they occur when a child is attempting to control crying, for they tend to vanish if and when crying breaks through'.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M.D., Blehar, M, Waters, E, &amp; Wall, S. (1978) Patterns of Attachment: A Psychological Study of the Strange Situation, Hillsdale, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum, p.282&lt;/ref&gt; Such observations also appeared in the doctoral theses of Ainsworth's students. Crittenden, for example, noted that one abused infant in her doctoral sample was classed as secure (B) by her undergraduate coders because her strange situation behaviour was "without either avoidance or ambivalence, she did show stress-related stereotypic headcocking throughout the strange situation. This pervasive behaviour, however, was the only clue to the extent of her stress".&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (1983) 'Mother and Infant Patterns of Attachment' Unpublished PhD Dissertation, University of Virginia, May 1983, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

Drawing on records of behaviours discrepant with the A, B, and C classifications, a fourth classification was added by Ainsworth's colleague [[Mary Main]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Mary |last1=Main |first2=Judith |last2=Solomon |year=1990 |chapter=Procedures for Identifying Infants as Disorganized/Disoriented during the Ainsworth Strange Situation |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzHIfiCXE8EC&amp;pg=PA121 |pages=121–60 |editor1-first=Mark T. |editor1-last=Greenberg |editor2-first=Dante |editor2-last=Cicchetti |editor3-first=E. Mark |editor3-last=Cummings |title=Attachment in the Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |isbn=978-0-226-30630-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Strange Situation, the attachment system is expected to be activated by the departure and return of the caregiver. If the behaviour of the infant does not appear to the observer to be coordinated in a smooth way across episodes to achieve either proximity or some relative proximity with the caregiver, then it is considered 'disorganised' as it indicates a disruption or flooding of the attachment system (e.g. by fear). Infant behaviours in the Strange Situation Protocol coded as disorganised/disoriented include overt displays of fear; contradictory behaviours or affects occurring simultaneously or sequentially; stereotypic, asymmetric, misdirected or jerky movements; or freezing and apparent dissociation. Lyons-Ruth has urged, however, that it should be wider 'recognized that 52% of disorganized infants continue to approach the caregiver, seek comfort, and cease their distress without clear ambivalent or avoidant behavior.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=K |last1=Lyons-Ruth |first2=JF |last2=Bureau |first3=MA |last3=Easterbrooks |first4=I |last4=Obsuth |first5=K |last5=Hennighausen |first6=L |last6=Vulliez-Coady |year=2013 |title=Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=15 |issue=5–6 |pages=562–582 |doi=10.1080/14616734.2013.841051 |pmid=24299135 |pmc=3861901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is 'rapidly growing interest in disorganized attachment' from clinicians and policy-makers as well as researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kochanska |first1=G |last2=Kim |first2=S |title=Early Attachment Organization With Both Parents and Future Behavior Problems: From Infancy to Middle Childhood |journal=Child Dev |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=283–296 |year=2013 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2012.01852.x |pmid=23005703 |pmc=3530645}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) classification has been criticised by some for being too encompassing.&lt;ref&gt;Svanberg, P.O. (2009). Promoting a secure attachment through early assessment and interventions. In J. Barlow &amp; P.O. Svanberg (Eds.) Keeping the Baby in Mind, (pp. 100-114), London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, Ainsworth put in print her blessing for the new 'D' classification, though she urged that the addition be regarded as 'open-ended, in the sense that subcategories may be distinguished', as she worried that the D classification might be too encompassing and might treat too many different forms of behaviour as if they were the same thing.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, M. (1990). 'Epilogue' in Attachment in the Preschool Years, ed. M.T. Greenberg, D. Ciccheti &amp; E.M. Cummings. Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press, pp.463-488&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the D classification puts together infants who use a somewhat disrupted secure (B) strategy with those who seem hopeless and show little attachment behaviour; it also puts together infants who run to hide when they see their caregiver in the same classification as those who show an avoidant (A) strategy on the first reunion and then an ambivalent-resistant (C) strategy on the second reunion. Perhaps responding to such concerns, George and Solomon have divided among indices of Disorganized/disoriented attachment (D) in the Strange Situation, treating some of the behaviours as a 'strategy of desperation' and others as evidence that the attachment system has been flooded (e.g. by fear, or anger).&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, J. &amp; George, C. (1999a) The place of disorganisation in attachment theory. In Judith Solomon &amp; Carol George (Eds) Attachment Disorganisation (pp3-32), p.27, NY: Guilford&lt;/ref&gt; Crittenden also argues that some behaviour classified as Disorganized/disoriented can be regarded as more 'emergency' versions of the avoidant and/or ambivalent/resistant strategies, and function to maintain the protective availability of the caregiver to some degree. Sroufe et al. have agreed that 'even disorganised attachment behaviour (simultaneous approach-avoidance; freezing, etc.) enables a degree of proximity in the face of a frightening or unfathomable parent'.&lt;ref&gt;Sroufe, A. Egeland, B., Carlson, E. &amp; Collins, W.A. (2005) The Development of the person: the Minnesota study of risk and adaptation from birth to adulthood, NY: Guilford Press, p.245&lt;/ref&gt; However, 'the presumption that many indices of "disorganisation" are aspects of organised patterns does not preclude acceptance of the notion of disorganisation, especially in cases where the complexity and dangerousness of the threat are beyond children's capacity for response'.&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. (1999) 'Danger and development: the organisation of self-protective strategies' in Atypical Attachment in Infancy and Early Childhood Among Children at Developmental Risk ed. Joan I. Vondra &amp; Douglas Barnett, Oxford: Blackwell pp. 159-160&lt;/ref&gt; For example, 'Children placed in care, especially more than once, often have intrusions. In videos of the Strange Situation Procedure, they tend to occur when a rejected/neglected child approaches the stranger in an intrusion of desire for comfort, then loses muscular control and falls to the floor, overwhelmed by the intruding fear of the unknown, potentially dangerous, strange person'.&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P. &amp; Landini, A (2011) Assessing Adult Attachment: A Dynamic-Maturational Approach to Discourse Analysis, NY: W.W.

=== Later patterns and the dynamic-maturational model ===

Studies of older children have identified further attachment classifications. Main and Cassidy observed that disorganized behaviour in infancy can develop into a child using caregiving-controlling or punitive behaviour in order to manage a helpless or dangerously unpredictable caregiver. In these cases, the child's behaviour is organised, but the behaviour is treated by researchers as a form of 'disorganization' (D) since the hierarchy in the family is no longer organised according to parenting authority.&lt;ref name="Main, M., &amp; Cassidy, J." /&gt;

[[Patricia McKinsey Crittenden]] has elaborated classifications of further forms of avoidant and ambivalent attachment behaviour. These include the caregiving and punitive behaviours also identified by Main and Cassidy (termed A3 and C3 respectively), but also other patterns such as compulsive compliance with the wishes of a threatening parent (A4).&lt;ref&gt;Crittenden, P.M. (2008) Raising Parents: Attachment, Parenting and Child Safety, London: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden's ideas developed from Bowlby's proposal that 'given certain adverse circumstances during childhood, the selective exclusion of information of certain sorts may be adaptive. Yet, when during adolescence and adult the situation changes, the persistent exclusion of the same forms of information may become maladaptive'.&lt;ref&gt;Bowlby, J. (1980) Loss, London: Penguin, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden She proposed that the basic components of human experience of danger are two kinds of information:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Strathearn |first1=L |last2=Fonagy |first2=P |last3=Amico |first3=J |last4=Montague |first4=PR |year=2009 |title=Adult attachment predicts mother's brain and peripheral oxytocin response to infant cues |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume=34 |issue=13 |pages=2655–2666 |doi=10.1038/npp.2009.103 |pmid=19710635 |pmc=3041266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1.	'Affective information' – the emotions provoked by the potential for danger, such as anger or fear. Crittenden terms this 'affective information'. In childhood this information would include emotions provoked by the unexplained absence of an attachment figure. Where an infant is faced with insensitive or rejecting parenting, one strategy for maintaining the availability of their attachment figure is to try to exclude from consciousness or from expressed behaviour any emotional information that might result in rejection.

2.	Causal or other sequentially-ordered knowledge about the potential for safety or danger. In childhood this would include knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven. If knowledge regarding the behaviours that indicate an attachment figure's availability as a secure haven is subject to segregation, then the infant can try to keep the attention of their caregiver through clingy or aggressive behaviour, or alternating combinations of the two. Such behaviour may increase the availability of an attachment figure who otherwise displays inconsistent or misleading responses to the infant's attachment behaviours, suggesting the unreliability of protection and safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Landa |first1=S. |last2=Duschinsky |first2=R. |year=2013 |title=Letters from ainsworth: contesting the 'organization' of attachment (comment on "Crittenden's dynamic–maturational model of attachment and adaptation") |journal=J Can Acad Child Adolesc Psychiatry |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=172–177 |pmid=23667365 |pmc=3647635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crittenden proposes that both kinds of information can be split off from consciousness or behavioural expression as a 'strategy' to maintain the availability of an attachment figure: 'Type A strategies were hypothesized to be based on reducing perception of threat to reduce the disposition to respond. Type C was hypothesized to be based on heightening perception of threat to increase the disposition to respond'&lt;ref&gt;p.435 in {{cite journal |last1=Crittenden |first1=P |last2=Newman |first2=L |year=2010 |title=Comparing models of borderline personality disorder: Mothers' experience, self-protective strategies, and dispositional representations |journal=Clin Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=15 |issue=3 |pages=433–451 |doi=10.1177/1359104510368209 |pmid=20603429 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Type A strategies split off emotional information about feeling threatened and type C strategies split off temporally-sequenced knowledge about how and why the attachment figure is available. By contrast, type B strategies effectively use both kinds of information without much distortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crittenden |first1=PM |year=1992 |title=Children's strategies for coping with adverse home environments |journal=Child Abuse Negl |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=329–343 |pmid=1617468 |doi=10.1016/0145-2134(92)90043-q}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: a toddler may have come to depend upon a type C strategy of tantrums in working to maintain the availability of an attachment figure whose inconsistent availability has led the child to distrust or distort causal information about their apparent behaviour. This may lead their attachment figure to get a clearer grasp on their needs and the appropriate response to their attachment behaviours. Experiencing more reliable and predictable information about the availability of their attachment figure, the toddler then no longer needs to use coercive behaviours with the goal of maintaining their caregiver's availability and can develop a secure attachment to their caregiver since they trust that their needs and communications will be heeded.

=== Significance of patterns ===
Research based on data from longitudinal studies, such as the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development|National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Study of Early Child Care]] and the Minnesota Study of Risk and Adaption from Birth to Adulthood, and from cross-sectional studies, consistently shows associations between early attachment classifications and peer relationships as to both quantity and quality. Lyons-Ruth, for example, found that 'for each additional withdrawing behavior displayed by mothers in relation to their infant's attachment cues in the Strange Situation Procedure, the likelihood of clinical referral by service providers was increased by 50%.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lyons-Ruth |first1=K |last2=Bureau |first2=JF |last3=Easterbrooks |first3=MA |last4=Obsuth |first4=I |last5=Hennighausen |first5=K |last6=Vulliez-Coady |first6=L |year=2013 |title=Parsing the construct of maternal insensitivity: distinct longitudinal pathways associated with early maternal withdrawal |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=15 |issue=5–6 |pages=562–582 |doi=10.1080/14616734.2013.841051 |pmid=24299135 |pmc=3861901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure children have more positive and fewer negative peer reactions and establish more and better friendships. Insecure-ambivalent children have a tendency to anxiously but unsuccessfully seek positive peer interaction whereas insecure-avoidant children appear aggressive and hostile and may actively repudiate positive peer interaction. On only a few measures is there any strong direct association between early experience and a comprehensive measure of social functioning in early adulthood but early experience significantly predicts early childhood representations of relationships, which in turn predicts later self and relationship representations and social behaviour.

Studies have suggested that infants with a high-risk for Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) may express attachment security differently from infants with a low-risk for ASD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Haltigan |first1=JD |last2=Ekas |first2=NV |last3=Seifer |first3=R |last4=Messinger |first4=DS |title=Attachment security in infants at-risk for autism spectrum disorders |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2011 |volume=41 |issue=7 |pages=962–967 |doi=10.1007/s10803-010-1107-7 |pmid=20859669 |pmc=4486071}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioural problems and social competence in insecure children increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in quality of parenting and the degree of risk in the family environment.&lt;ref name=bercasapp&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |vauthors=Berlin LJ, Cassidy J, Appleyard K |title=The Influence of Early Attachments on Other Relationships |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |editors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=333–47 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the Strange Situation Protocol==

[[Michael Rutter]] describes the procedure in the following terms:&lt;ref name="Rutter, M."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rutter |first1=M |year=1995 |title=Clinical implications of attachment concepts: retrospect and prospect |journal=J Child Psychol Psychiatry |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=549–571 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-7610.1995.tb02314.x |pmid=7650083}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Father with child.jpg|thumb|190px|Father and child|left]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It is by no means free of limitations (see Lamb, Thompson, Gardener, Charnov &amp; Estes, 1984).&lt;ref name="Lamb et al.,"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lamb |first1=M. |last2=Thompson |first2=R. A. |last3=Gardener |first3=W. P. |last4=Charnov |first4=E. L. |last5=Estes |first5=D. |year=1984 |title=Security of infantile attachment as assessed in the "strange situation": Its study and biological interpretation |journal=Behav Brain Sci |volume=7 |pages=127–147 |doi=10.1017/s0140525x00026522}}&lt;/ref&gt; To begin with, it is very dependent on brief
separations and reunions having the same meaning for all children. This may be a major constraint when applying the procedure in cultures, such as that in Japan (see Miyake et al., 1985), where infants are rarely separated from their mothers in ordinary circumstances.&lt;ref name="Miyake et al.,"&gt;Miyake, Chen, &amp; Campos (1985). Infant temperament and mother's mode of interaction and attachment in Japan; an interim report; In I. Bretherton &amp; E Waters (Eds), Growing points of attachment theory and research. Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development, 50, Serial No 209, 276-297.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, because older children have a cognitive capacity to maintain relationships when the older person is not present, separation may not provide the same stress for them. Modified procedures based on the Strange Situation have been developed for older preschool children (see Belsky et al., 1994; Greenberg et al., 1990) but it is much more dubious whether the same approach can be used in middle childhood.&lt;ref name="Belsky et al.,"&gt;Belsky, J. &amp; Cassidy, J. (1994). Attachment Theory and Evidence. In M. Rutter &amp; D. Hay (Eds) Development Through Life; A Handbook For Clinicians (pp. 373-402). Oxford; Blackwell Scientific Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg et al., 1990."&gt;Greenberg, M. T., Cicchetti, D. &amp; Cummings, M. (Eds), (1990). Attachment in the preschool years; theory research and intervention. Chicago; University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, despite its manifest strengths, the procedure is based on just 20 minutes of behaviour. It can be scarcely expected to tap all the relevant qualities of a child's attachment relationships. Q-sort procedures based on much longer naturalistic observations in the home, and interviews with the mothers have developed in order to extend the data base (see Vaughn &amp; Waters, 1990).&lt;ref name="Vaughn et al.,"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vaughn |first1=BE |last2=Waters |first2=E |year=1990 |title=Attachment behaviour at home and in the laboratory |journal=Child Dev |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=1965–1973 |doi=10.2307/1130850 |pmid=2083508}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further constraint is that the coding procedure results in discrete categories rather than continuously distributed dimensions. Not only is this likely to provide boundary problems, but also it is not at all obvious that discrete categories best represent the concepts that are inherent in attachment security. It seems much more likely that infants vary in their degree of security and there is need for a measurement systems that can quantify individual variation".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Ecological validity and universality of Strange Situation attachment classification distributions ===
With respect to the ecological validity of the Strange Situation, a meta-analysis of 2,000 infant-parent dyads, including several from studies with non-Western language and/or cultural bases found the global distribution of attachment categorizations to be A (21%), B (65%), and C (14%).&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M. H. &amp; Kroonenberg, P.M."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van IJzendoorn |first1=M.H. |last2=Kroonenberg |first2=P.M. |year=1988 |title=Cross-cultural patterns of attachment: A meta-analysis of the strange-situation |journal=Child Dev |volume=59 |issue=1 |pages=147–156 |doi=10.2307/1130396 |jstor=1130396}}&lt;/ref&gt; This global distribution was generally consistent with Ainsworth et al.'s (1978) original attachment classification distributions.

However, controversy has been raised over a few cultural differences in these rates of 'global' attachment classification distributions. In particular, two studies diverged from the global distributions of attachment classifications noted above. One study was conducted in North Germany in which more avoidant (A) infants were found than global norms would suggest, and the other in Sapporo, Japan, where more resistant (C) infants were found.&lt;ref name="Grossmann K.E., et al."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grossmann |first1=K. |last2=Grossmann |first2=K.E. |last3=Huber |first3=F. |last4=Wartner |first4=U. |year=1981 |title=German children's behavior toward their mothers at 12 months and their fathers at 18 months in Ainsworth's strange situation |journal=International Journal of Behavioral Development |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=157–184 |doi=10.1177/016502548100400202 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Takahashi, K."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Takahashi |first1=K. |year=1986 |title=Examining the Strange-Situation procedure with Japanese mothers and 12-month-old infants |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=265–270 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.22.2.265 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these two studies, the Japanese findings have sparked the most controversy as to the meaning of individual differences in attachment behaviour as originally identified by Ainsworth et al. (1978).

In a recent study conducted in Sapporo, Behrens et al. (2007) found attachment distributions consistent with global norms using the six-year Main &amp; Cassidy scoring system for attachment classification.&lt;ref name="Main, M., &amp; Cassidy, J."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Main |first1=M. |last2=Cassidy |first2=J. |year=1988 |title=Categories of response to reunion with the parent at age 6: Predictable from infant attachment classifications and stable over a 1-month period |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=415–426 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.24.3.415 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behrens, K. Y., Main, M., &amp; Hesse, E."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behrens |first1=K. Y. |last2=Main |first2=M. |last3=Hesse |first3=E. |year=2007 |title=Mothers' Attachment Status as Determined by the Adult Attachment Interview Predicts Their 6-Year-Olds' Reunion Responses: A Study Conducted in Japan |journal=Dev Psychol |volume=43 |issue=6 |pages=1553–1567 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.43.6.1553 |pmid=18020832}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to these findings supporting the global distributions of attachment classifications in Sapporo, Behrens et al. also discuss the Japanese concept of [[amae]] and its relevance to questions concerning whether the insecure-resistant (C) style of interaction may be engendered in Japanese infants as a result of the cultural practice of [[amae]].

A separate study was conducted in Korea, to help determine if mother-infant attachment relationships are universal or culture-specific.  The results of the study of infant-mother attachment were compared to a national sample and showed that the four attachment patterns, secure, avoidance, ambivalent, and disorganized, exist in Korea as well as other varying cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jin |first1=MK |last2=Jacobvitz |first2=D |last3=Hazen |first3=N |last4=Jung |first4=SH |year=2012 |title=Maternal sensitivity and infant attachment security in Korea: Cross-cultural validation of the Strange Situation |journal=Attach Hum Dev |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=33–44 |doi=10.1080/14616734.2012.636656 |pmid=22191605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marinus van IJzendoorn|Van IJzendoorn]] and Kroonenberg conducted a meta-analysis of various countries, including Japan, Israel, Germany, China, the UK and the USA using the Strange Situation. The research showed that though there were cultural differences, the four  basic patterns, secure, avoidance, ambivalent, and disorganized can be found in every culture in which studies have been undertaken, even where communal sleeping arrangements are the norm. Selection of the secure pattern is found in the majority of children across cultures studied. This follows logically from the fact that attachment theory provides for infants to adapt to changes in the environment, selecting optimal behavioural strategies.&lt;ref name=ijzsag&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |vauthors=van IJzendoorn MH, Sagi-Schwartz A |year=2008 |title=Cross-Cultural Patterns of Attachment; Universal and Contextual Dimensions |encyclopedia=Handbook of Attachment: Theory, Research and Clinical Applications |editors=Cassidy J, Shaver PR |publisher=Guilford Press |location=New York and London |pages=880–905 |isbn=978-1-59385-874-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; How attachment is expressed shows cultural variations which need to be ascertained before studies can be undertaken.&lt;ref name=ijzsag /&gt;

=== Discrete or continuous attachment measurement ===
Regarding the issue of whether the breadth of infant attachment functioning can be captured by a categorical classification scheme, it should be noted that continuous measures of attachment security have been developed which have demonstrated adequate psychometric properties. These have been used either individually or in conjunction with discrete attachment classifications in many published reports.&lt;ref name="Richters, J. E., Waters, E., &amp; Vaughn, B. E."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Richters |first1=J. E. |last2=Waters |first2=E. |last3=Vaughn |first3=B. E. |year=1988 |title=Empirical classification of infant-mother relationships from interactive behavior and crying during reunion |journal=Child Dev |volume=59 |issue=2 |pages=512–522 |doi=10.2307/1130329 |pmid=3359869 |jstor=1130329}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M . H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P. M."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Van IJzendoorn |first1=M. H. |last2=Kroonenberg |first2=P. M. |year=1990 |title=Cross-cultural consistency of coding the strange situation |journal=Infant Behavior and Development |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=469–485 |doi=10.1016/0163-6383(90)90017-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original Richter's et al. (1998) scale is strongly related to secure versus insecure classifications, correctly predicting about 90% of cases.&lt;ref name="Van IJzendoorn, M . H., &amp; Kroonenberg, P. M." /&gt; Readers further interested in the categorical versus continuous nature of attachment classifications (and the debate surrounding this issue) should consult a paper by Fraley and Spieker and the rejoinders in the same issue by many prominent attachment researchers including J. Cassidy, A. Sroufe, E. Waters &amp; T. Beauchaine, and M. Cummings.&lt;ref name="Fraley, C. R. &amp; Spieker, S. J."&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fraley |first1=C. R. |last2=Spieker |first2=S.

'''COMBINE''', the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork, is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats for computational models, initially in [[systems biology]] and related fields.&lt;ref name="combine"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://co.mbine.org| title = the computational modeling in biology network| publisher = combine| accessdate  = 23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The COMBINE initiative was started in 2010 in an attempt to start a broader series of scientific meetings in order to replace several smaller and more focused meetings and [[hackathon]]s, notably the [[Systems Biology Graphical Notation]] (SBGN) and [[Systems Biology Markup Language]] (SBML) meetings. The first COMBINE meeting was organised by [[Igor Goryanin]] and held at the [[University of Edinburgh School of Informatics]] in October 2010. The final session of the meeting was followed by an event marking the 10th anniversary of SBML.&lt;ref name=combine-2010&gt;{{cite web|title=Events/Forums/COMBINE 2010 - SBML.caltech.edu|url=http://sbml.org/Events/Forums/COMBINE_2010|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; COMBINE meetings have been held annually since; COMBINE 2014 was organised by the [[University of Southern California]] and COMBINE 2015 will be organised by the group of Chris Myers at the [[University of Utah]].&lt;ref name=combine-events&gt;{{cite web|title=Events - COMBINE|url=http://co.mbine.org/Events#Annual_COMBINE_meetings|accessdate=6 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation formats==
The COMBINE initiative aims to coordinate the development of community standards and formats for computational modelling, particularly in systems biology. In doing so, it is expected a set of complementary but non-overlapping standards will be developed, covering all aspects of computational modelling in all areas of biology.&lt;ref name=combine /&gt; The major representation formats covered by COMBINE activity are the [[BioPAX]] standards language, [[SBGN]], [[SBML]] and the [[SED-ML]] and [[CellML]] [[markup language]]s.&lt;ref name="standards"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://co.mbine.org/standards| title= Standards covered by or related to COMBINE activities| publisher= combine| accessdate= 23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The associated standardisation efforts are [[Minimum information required in the annotation of models|MIRIAM]], [[Systems Biology Ontology|SBO]], [[KiSAO]] and the [[BioModels.net]] model repository.&lt;ref name="standards" /&gt;

'''Cadarache''' is the largest technological research and development center for energy in Europe including CEA research activities and ITER.
CEA Cadarache is one of the 10 research centers of the French Commission of Atomic and Alternative Energies. Established in the French département [[Bouches-du-Rhône]], close to the village Saint Paul-lez-Durance, CEA Cadarache, created in 1959, is located about 40 kilometers from Aix-en-Provence, approximately 60 kilometres (37&amp;nbsp;mi) north-east of the city of [[Marseille]] and stands near the borders of three other départements: the Alpes de Haute-Provence, the Var and the Vaucluse. It is one of the major sources of employment in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur region (PACA) and has one of the heaviest concentrations of specialized scientific staff.
Cadarache began its research activities when [[President]] [[Charles de Gaulle]] launched France's atomic energy program in 1959. The center is operated by the [[French Alternative Energies and Atomic Energy Commission|Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique et aux énergies alternatives]] (CEA, [[English language|en]]: Atomic Energy and Alternative Energy Commission).
In 2005, Cadarache was selected to be the site of the [[International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor]] (ITER), the world's largest [[nuclear fusion]] reactor. Construction of the ITER complex began in 2007, and it is projected to begin [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]-generating operations in the 2020s.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/one-giant-leap-for-mankind-13bn-iter-project-makes-breakthrough-in-the-quest-for-nuclear-fusion-a-8590480.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tass.com/economy/768454&lt;/ref&gt; Cadarache also plays host to a number of [[research reactors]], such as the [[Jules Horowitz Reactor]], which is expected to enter operation around 2021.

==Facilities==
[[File:Cadarache.JPG|thumb|250px|right|The Cadarache facility in 2008.]]
The Cadarache center is the largest  energy research site in Europe, hosting 19 Basic Nuclear Installation (BNI) and a secret BNI, including reactors, waste stockpiling and recycling facilities, bio-technology facilities and solar platforms. It employs over 5,000 people, and approximately 700 students and foreign collaborators carry out research in the facility’s laboratories.
[[ITER]], the experimental [[nuclear fusion]] [[tokamak]], is currently under construction at Cadarache and is expected to create its first plasma by 2025. When it becomes operational, ITER is hoped to be the first large-scale fusion reactor to produce more energy than is used to initiate its fusion reactions.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-11541383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://tass.com/economy/768454&lt;/ref&gt; Other nuclear installations at Cadarache include the Tore Supra tokamak – a predecessor to ITER – and the Jules Horowitz Reactor, a 100-megawatt research reactor which is planned to begin operation in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-Materials-test-reactor-gets-its-dome-1612134.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
Numerous nuclear research activities are conducted at Cadarache, including [[mixed-oxide fuel]] (MOX) production, [[nuclear propulsion]] and [[fission reactor]] prototyping, [[nuclear fusion]] research and research into new forms of fission fuel. [[Nuclear waste]] is also treated and recycled at the site.

==Notable incidents==
A number of accidents, of varying severity, have occurred at Cadarache since its inception. Some of these incidents are listed below.
*31 March 1994: A [[sodium]] explosion took place while the [[Rapsodie]] experimental reactor was being dismantled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.actualites-news-environnement.com/20070315-Cadarache-proces-Commissariat-energie-atomique.php "Cadarache, le procès du Commissariat à l'énergie atomique renvoyé à décembre" (in French)]. Actualités-News-Environnement.com. 15 March 2007. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion was classified as a Class 2 incident by the [[Autorité de sûreté nucléaire|ASN]].
*25 September 1998: A sodium fire occurred in a non-nuclear test facility, but caused no significant damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wise-paris.org/index.html?/english/ournews/year_1998/ournews0000981001.html&amp;/english/frame/menu.html&amp;/english/frame/band.html|title='Controlled' Sodium Fire at Cadarache|publisher=WISE Paris|date=1 October 1998|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*2 November 2004: A fire broke out, but caused no radioactive contamination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediterranee.france3.fr/dossiers/7000528-fr.php "Incident à Cadarache" (in French)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325050518/http://mediterranee.france3.fr/dossiers/7000528-fr.php |date=25 March 2012 }}. France3.fr. 2 November 2004. Retrieved 12 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
*6 November 2006: A fault in the equipment used to weigh [[MOX]] led to a grinder being loaded with more than the authorized amount {{convert|8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of fissile material, presenting the possible threat of a spontaneous nuclear reaction. Initially classified as a low-priority Class-1 level incident, it was subsequently revised to Class 2 by the ASN.
*1 October 2008 : A fire broke out in a non-nuclear installation.
*6 October 2009:  A higher quantity of [[plutonium]] than authorized was uncovered in the Plutonium Technology Workshop. The ASN classified the incident as Class 2, and suspended dismantling work on the workshop. After investigation, it was revealed that the cause of the incident was the accumulation between 1966 and 2004 of fine plutonium dust in the 450 glove boxes in the workshop. Following the incident, further inspections revealed that another installation, STAR, also showed quantities of plutonium in excess of the authorized amounts. The incident was classified level 1 by the ASN.

==Seismological risk==
{{update-section|date=December 2015}}
Cadarache is situated on the [[Aix-en-Provence]]-[[Durance]] [[seismological fault]], and lies close to another fault, [[Trévaresse]]. The Aix-Durance fault caused France's [[1909 Lambesc earthquake|worst recorded earthquake]] in 1909. In a 2000 report, the ASN mandated the closure of six installations at Cadarache that did not meet [[aseismic]] construction standards; a similar report was issued by a French nuclear safety organization in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/jul2000/2000-07-21-11.asp|title=French Nuclear Facility Must Close or Risk Earthquake|publisher=ENS|date=21 July 2000|accessdate=6 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, three of these had been shut down, with the remaining three to be shut down by 2015.

'''Comedy rock''' is rock music mixed with [[Comedy music|comedy]], often satire and parody.&lt;ref name=AllmusicComedyRock&gt;V. Bogdanov, C. Woodstra and S. T. Erlewine, ''All music guide to rock: the definitive guide to rock, pop, and soul'' (Backbeat Books, 3rd Edition., 2002), pp. 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early bands and songs===
Early American examples include [[Stan Freberg]], who lampooned artists such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[Harry Belafonte]] and [[The Platters]], and [[Sheb Wooley]]. The latter's "[[Purple People Eater]]" reached No. 1 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop chart in 1958 and stayed there 6 weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   | last = Bronson  | first = Fred  | title = The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits: The Inside Story Behind Every Number  | publisher = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard Books]]  | year = 2003  | isbn = 0-8230-7677-6  | page = 38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Britain during the 1950s and early 1960s comedians such as [[Charlie Drake]] and [[The Goons]] frequently appeared in the top ten with humorous rock 'n' roll records—the latter, along with [[Lewis Carroll]] and [[Edward Lear]], were to influence the word-play of [[John Lennon]]'s lyrics. Later British groups specialised in comedy: these included [[The Scaffold]], [[The Bonzo Dog Doo-Dah Band]] and [[Alberto y Lost Trios Paranoias]]. Later in Britain, in the 2000s, [[Mitch Benn]] released several studio albums that satirised current affairs using various musical genres, but mainly rock. His 2012 ''Breaking Strings'' album was critically acclaimed for its rock sensibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John-Paul |last=Stephenson |title=CD Review: Mitch Benn &amp; The Distractions – Breaking Strings.|url=http://www.gigglebeats.co.uk/2012/02/cd-review-mitch-benn-the-distractions-breaking-strings/ |work=Giggle Beats |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allmusic]] described [[Frank Zappa]] as the "godfather" of comedy rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/comedy-rock-ma0000012139/artists |title=Comedy rock |publisher=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[pop rock]] and [[folk rock]] band [[The Turtles]] released a comedy rock album, ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'', in 1968, though the band had previously incorporated humor into their songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic |class=album |id=r20668 |tab=review |label="''The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands'' &gt; Review" |Michael |last=Ofjord |accessdate={{date|2011-09-22}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of its members, [[Howard Kaylan]] and [[Mark Volman]] later performed more explicitly comedic songs as [[Flo &amp; Eddie]] with their own band and with Frank Zappa.

===Contemporary bands===
Several modern comedy rock bands have experienced mainstream commercial success. Duos [[Tenacious D]] and [[Flight of the Conchords]] both released platinum-selling albums and starred in their own respective comedic television series. [[Dan Finnerty]] with his [[The Dan Band]] has made comedy rock appearances in the [[Todd Phillips]] films ''[[Old School (film)|Old School]]'' and ''[[The Hangover]]'' spoofing "[[Total Eclipse of the Heart]]" and "[[Candy Shop]]", as well as his live show, which parodies female cover songs and was filmed as a one-hour TV special directed by [[McG]] and executive produced by [[Steven Spielberg]]. [[Stephen Lynch (musician)|Stephen Lynch]] from New York developed a following with several Opie and Anthony appearances which led to two specials on Comedy Central. He performed on Broadway with the production of Grease.

With over 12 million albums sold, song parodist [["Weird Al" Yankovic]] remains the highest-selling comedy act in history, with his 2014 album ''[[Mandatory Fun]]'' having debuted at #1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], the first comedy album to do so since [[Allan Sherman]]{{'}}s ''[[My Son, the Nut]]'' in 1963.&lt;ref name="billboardnews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6176745/weird-al-yankovic-billboard-200-mandatory-fun-number-one | title = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Gets First No. 1 Album On Billboard 200 with 'Mandatory Fun' | first = Keith | last = Caulfield | date = July 23, 2014 | accessdate = July 23, 2014 |work = [[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rock has been the target of many [[Parody|spoof]]s and several spoof bands have gone on to have hit records, for example [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] in the U.S., and [[The Hee Bee Gee Bees]] and [[Bad News (band)|Bad News]] in the UK. The band [[Steel Panther]] has become a fixture on the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] [[Sunset Strip]] with their parody of 80s [[glam metal]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Feeling The Steel Panther: Interview with Michael Starr |publisher=The Aquarian Weekly |date=4 October 2009 |work=Nightlife |url=http://www.theaquarian.com/2009/10/04/interview-steel-panther-michael-starr-feeling-the-steel/ | accessdate=10 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and their success has opened the doors for other spoof bands such as [[The Jimi Homeless Experience]]. Other spoof bands such as [[Dread Zeppelin]], [[Beatallica]] and [[Those Darn Accordions]] rely on unusual or intentionally contrasting genre-mixing for comic effect. Comedy rock duo [[Ninja Sex Party]], who have collaborated with Steel Panther on occasion, blend rock and [[synthpop]] and have produced songs that parody the [[dubstep]] and heavy metal genres. They have enjoyed success from their online popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |last=Milne |first=Gregory |title=Ninja Sex Party: Tales of Strawberries and Cream |date=11 July 2013 |newspaper=Living Myth Magazine |publisher=Living Myth Magazine |accessdate=29 June 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160525175156/http://livingmythmagazine.com/blog/2013/07/11/ninja-sex-party-tales-of-strawberries-and-cream/ |archivedate=25 May 2016 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another band, [[Primus (band)|Primus]], is known for their wacky lyrics and comedic music videos.

Many bands within the [[alternative rock]] and [[college rock]] spectrum are known for their incorporation of humorous and satirical songs, with bands such as [[They Might Be Giants]], [[The Presidents of the United States of America (band)|The Presidents of the United States of America]], [[Bloodhound Gang]], [[System of a Down]], [[Ween]] and [[Camper Van Beethoven]] finding both mainstream and independent success in the United States, as well as successful foreign bands such as [[Parokya ni Edgar]] and [[Knorkator]].

[[Punk rock]] and [[pop punk]] has made its contribution to the comedy rock ranks, with such bands as [[The Aquabats]], [[Blink-182]], [[Bowling for Soup]], [[Patent Pending (band)|Patent Pending]], [[Dead Kennedys]], [[The Dead Milkmen]], [[The Meatmen]] and [[The Radioactive Chicken Heads]]. [[Heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] has also produced many humor-oriented and satirical bands, including [[Green Jellÿ]], [[Lawnmower Deth]], [[Massacration]], [[M.O.D.]], [[Big Dumb Face]], [[Psychostick]], Crotchduster, [[Ludichrist]] and [[Scatterbrain (band)|Scatterbrain]], while other bands like [[Gwar]] and [[Rosemary's Billygoat]] utilize outrageous costumes and over-the-top stage shows. The [[virtual band]] [[Dethklok]] is [[death metal]] spoof featured in the [[Adult Swim]] animated TV Show ''[[Metalocalypse]]''&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p882076|pure_url=yes}} allmusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and their album entitled ''[[The Dethalbum]]'' debuted at No. 21 on the ''Billboard'' Top 200 list.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 Dethalbum Debuts At #21 On Billboard Top 200] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090705003124/http://sickdrummer.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=642&amp;Itemid=2 |date=5 July 2009 }}" 9 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5457">In [[ecology]], the '''competition–colonization trade-off''' is a [[Coexistence theory|stabilizing mechanism]] that has been proposed to explain [[species diversity]] in some biological systems, especially those that are not in equilibrium.&lt;ref name="hastings1980"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hastings|first1=Alan|title=Disturbance, coexistence, history, and competition for space|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 1980|volume=18|issue=3|pages=363–373|doi=10.1016/0040-5809(80)90059-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cadotte|first=Marc William|date=April 2007|title=Competition-colonization trade-offs and disturbance effects at multiple scales|journal=Ecology|volume=88|issue=4|pages=823–829|issn=0012-9658|pmid=17536699}}&lt;/ref&gt; In which case some species are particularly good at colonizing and others have well-established survival abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Calcagno|first1=V|last2=Mouquet|first2=N|last3=Jarne|first3=P|last4=David|first4=P|title=Coexistence in a metacommunity: the competition– colonization trade-off is not dead|journal=Ecology Letters|date=2006|volume=9|pages=897–907}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The concept of the competition-colonization trade-off was originally proposed by Levins and Culver, the model indicated that two species could coexist if one had impeccable competition skill and the other was excellent at colonizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levins|first1=R|last2=Culver|first2=D|title=Regional coexistence of species and competition between rare species|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA|date=1971|volume=6|pages=1246–1248}}&lt;/ref&gt; The model indicates that there is typically a trade-off, in which a species is typically better at either competing or colonizing. A later model, labelled The Lottery Model was also proposed, in which interspecific competition is accounted for within the population.

'''Mathematical Models:'''

''Levins and Culver Model:''

dp1/dt = c1p1(1 - p1) - m1p1. 

dp2/dt = c2p2(1 - p1 - p2) - m2p2 - c1p1p2.

Where:
pi = fraction of patches that are occupied by a species(i).
ci = colonization rate of species(i).
mi = mortality rate, independent of patch density.

Species 1 = competitor, can colonize in area that is not inhabited by species 2 (1 - p1).

Species 2 = colonizer, can only colonize in uninhabited areas (1 - p1 - p2).

Species 2 is subject to predator displacement (- c1p1p2).

If species 2 has a higher colonization rate it can coexist with species 1 (c2 &gt; c12/m).

This model is described as the displacement competition model, it has been observed in marine mollusks and fungi. This model makes two large assumptions: 
1. "a propagule of a superior competitor takes over a patch from an adult of the inferior competitor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yu|first1=D|last2=Wilson|first2=H|title=The Competition-Colonization Trade-off Is Dead; Long Live the Competition-Colonization Trade-off|journal=The American Naturalist|date=2001|volume=158|pages=49–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;
2. The adult must be displaced fast enough to ensure that it does not reproduce while it is being displaced.

''Lottery Model:''

dp1/dt = c1(f/(f + p2))p1(h - p1 - p2) m1p1.
dp2/dt = c2(g/(g + p1))p2(h - p1 - p2) m2p2.

Colonization rate is now described by interspecific competition.

(f/(f + p2)) and (g/(g + p1)). Both f and g &gt; 0.

An increase in p1 is related to a decrease in the colonization rate of species 2.

g &lt; f implies a competitive advantage of species 1 and c2 &gt; c1 implies a colonization advantage for species 2.

'''In Plants:'''

The competition-colonization trade-off theory has primarily been used to examine and describe the dispersal-linked traits of a plant's seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cadotte|first1=M|last2=Mai|first2=D|last3=Collins|first3=M|last4=Keele|first4=M|last5=Drake|first5=J|title=On testing the competition-colonization trade-off in a multispecies assemblage|journal=The American Naturalist|date=2006|volume=168|pages=704–709}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seed size is a primary feature that relates to a species ability to colonize or compete within a given population, the effect of seed size was displayed in dicotyledonous annual plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turnbull|first1=L|last2=Coomes|first2=D|last3=Hector|first3=A|last4=Rees|first4=M|title=Seed mass and the competition/colonization trade-off: competitive interactions and spatial patterns in a guild of annual plants|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=2004|volume=92|pages=97–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turnbull and colleagues indicated that the competition/colonization trade-off has a stabilizing effect on the population of plants.

'''In Algae:'''

For example, in a classic study on an [[intertidal zone]] in [[Southern California]],&lt;ref name="sousa1979"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sousa|first1=Wayne P.|title=Disturbance in Marine Intertidal Boulder Fields: The Nonequilibrium Maintenance of Species Diversity|journal=Ecology|date=December 1979|volume=60|issue=6|pages=1225|doi=10.2307/1936969}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was shown that when a boulder was overturned, it would quickly be colonized by [[green algae]] and [[barnacle]]s (which were better colonizers).  However, if left undisturbed, the boulders would eventually be overtaken by [[red algae]] (which was the stronger competitor in the long term).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8737">'''Cross-fostering''' is a technique used in [[animal husbandry]], [[animal science]], [[Genetics|genetic]] and [[nature versus nurture]] studies, and [[conservation (genetics)|conservation]], whereby [[offspring]] are removed from their biological [[parent]]s at birth and raised by surrogates. This can also occasionally occur in nature.

==Animal husbandry==
Cross-fostering young animals is usually done to equalize litter size. Individual animals born in large litters are faced with much more competition for resources, such as breast milk, food and space, than individuals born in smaller litters. Herd managers will typically move some individuals from a large litter to a smaller litter where they will be raised by a non-biological parent. This is typically done in [[pig farming]] because litters with up to 15 piglets are common. A sow with a large litter may have difficulty producing enough milk for all piglets, or the sow may not have enough functional teats to feed all piglets simultaneously. When this occurs, smaller or weaker piglets are at risk of starving to death. Herd managers will often transfer some piglets from a large litter to another lactating sow which either has a smaller litter or has had her own biological piglets recently weaned. Herd managers will typically try to equalize litters by number and also weight of individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Cross+foster Cross Foster at Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; When done successfully, cross-fostering reduces piglet mortality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vet.chula.ac.th/~tjvm/full_text/v32/v32_special_edition/F32S9.pdf The Impact of Cross-Fostering on Swine Production] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110728112415/http://www.vet.chula.ac.th/~tjvm/full_text/v32/v32_special_edition/F32S9.pdf |date=2011-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In research==
Cross-fostering can be used to study the impact of postnatal environment on genetic-linked diseases as well as on behavioural pattern. In behavioral studies, if cross-fostered offspring show a behavioral [[trait (biology)|trait]] similar to their biological parents and dissimilar from their foster parents, a behavior can be shown to have a genetic basis. Similarly if the offspring develops traits dissimilar to their biological parents and similar to their foster parents environmental factors are shown to be dominant. In many cases there is a blend of the two, which shows both [[genes]] and environment play a part.

In animal studies, genetically hypertensive offspring reared by normotensive dams have been shown to have lower blood pressure compared to the controls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} This shows that hypertensive genotype could be modified by the changes of the postnatal environment. Besides this, [[hyperkinetic]] animals reared by a normal dam have been shown to have lower [[locomotor activity]] compared to its controls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In one experiment, [[siblicide]] was shown to be somehow related to parental care. When non-obligate siblicidal blue-footed boobies were swapped with obligate siblicidal masked booby chicks, it was found that the blue-footed chicks exhibited more siblicidal behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Loughweed|first=Lynn W.|title=Parent Blue-footed Boobies Suppress Siblicidal Behavior of Offspring|journal=Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology|year=1999|volume=45|issue=1|pages=11–18|doi=10.1007/s002650050535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In selective livestock breeding cross-fostering can be used to combine desirable genetic qualities such as weight, fat distribution or appearance with environmentally influenced ones such as temperament.

In humans, studies of children in [[foster care]] have shown that [[alcoholism]] is both genetic and environmental: early onset alcoholism can be linked to biological parentage, whereas adult onset alcoholism is often influenced by the alcohol abuse by foster parents.

==In conservation==

Cross fostering has been used in [[conservation biology]] such as the rearing of [[black robin]] chicks by other species. In this instance the species was so close to [[extinction]], with literally a handful of surviving individuals and a single mother, there was little chance of raising many offspring. In this case a related species were used to raise the eggs, with their own eggs being replaced by conservation workers with those of the robin. In this case [[imprinting (psychology)|imprinting]] is one of the concerns, as species raised in a different environment may not be able to recognize their own [[species]]. In a world first, the Adelaide Zoo successfully cross-fostered a baby tree kangaroo, whose mother was killed when it was five weeks old, with a surrogate rock-wallaby mother.  The Zoo has had a successful cross-fostering program between wallaby species, but this is the first time it was tried with a tree kangaroo and wallaby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/topics/wildlife/2015/06/tree-kangaroo-cross-fostering/ VIDEO: Baby tree kangaroo fostered by rock wallaby], Australian Geographic, 19 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==In nature==
[[File:Galahs flying motion blur.jpg|right|thumb|The ranges of these galahs overlap with a related species, leading to natural cross fostering.]]
Cross fostering may occasionally occur in natural situations. In [[Australia]], the closely related species from the [[cockatoo]] family, ''[[Eolophus roseicapilla]]'' (the [[galah]]) and ''Cacatua leadbeateri'' (the [[pink cockatoo]]), have overlapping [[range (biology)|ranges]], and [[interspecific competition|compete]] for [[nest]]ing holes. However, two pairs of birds may share the same nest for a time, as they do not become aggressive until several eggs have been laid and [[Avian incubation|incubation]] begins. When they do, the pink cockatoos are always the victors, evicting the galahs in what is termed [[Competition (biology)#By mechanism|interference competition]]. They are not consciously aware that some of the eggs in the nest were laid by the other bird however, and thus raise offspring of both species. These natural [[experiment]]s have been used by Australian [[ornithologist]]s Graeme Chapman and Ian Rowley to investigate the relative importance of genes and environment.&lt;ref&gt;Rowley, I. &amp; G. Chapman (1986) Cross-fostering, imprinting , and learning in two sympatric species of cockatoos. ''[[Behaviour (journal)|Behaviour]]'' 96: 1-16&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they discovered that the galah chicks gave normal begging calls and [[alarm calls]], but their [[bird song|contact calls]] (used to maintain [[social behavior|social cohesion]]) were more like those of the pink cockatoos with which they lived.

Such natural instances of cross fostering can also lead to [[Hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] between species that would not normally breed. A case of this is offered by the [[Galapagos finches]]. Two species of the genus ''[[Geospiza]]'', the [[medium ground-finch]] (''Geospiza fortis'') and the [[common cactus-finch]] (''Geospiza scandens'') occasionally hybridize. The birds' [[Bird vocalization|songs]] are a barrier to interbreeding, but sometimes young birds will not learn their own species song, e.g. if their father dies and they are nesting near another species. Another situation where birds can [[imprinting (psychology)|imprint]] on the wrong song is when one species takes over the nest of another, but fails to remove all of its eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with [[Peter and Rosemary Grant]], in 
{{cite book |title=Biology |last=Campbell |first=Neil |authorlink=Neil Campbell (scientist) |author2=[[Jane B. Reece]]  |year=2002 |publisher=Benjamin Cummings |location= San Francisco |isbn=978-0-8053-6624-2 |page=1247 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross fostered young can then hybridize with their foster parents' species, allowing [[gene flow]] between the two populations. Hybrids experience reduced [[fitness (biology)|fitness]], however, so the two species can remain separate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mogbo |first1=T. C. |last2=Okeke |first2=T.

'''Customer support''' is a range of [[customer service]]s to assist customers in making cost effective and correct use of a product. It includes assistance in planning, installation, training, troubleshooting, maintenance, upgrading, and disposal of a product.&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/customer-support.html|title=What is customer support? definition and meaning|work=BusinessDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding technology products such as mobile phones, televisions, computers, software products or other electronic or mechanical goods, it is termed [[technical support]].&lt;ref name="businessdirectory-definition"/&gt;

Customer support is considered as one of the main data channels for [[customer satisfaction research]] and a way to increase [[customer retention]].

==Automation==&lt;!--[[Support automation]] redirects here--&gt;
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}

[[Automation]] of service organizations aim to achieve, for example, lower [[mean time to repair]] (MTTR).

Customer support automation involves the building of a [[knowledge base]] of known [[issue (computers)|issue]]s and their resolution to support [[incident management|incident]]s with delivery mechanisms, often by [[expert system]]s. A service automation platform includes a suite of support solutions including proactive support, assisted support and self-support. 

With automated support, service organizations can make their services available to their customers [[24/7|24 hours a day and 7 days a week]], by monitoring [[alarm]]s, identifying problems at an early stage and resolving issues before they become problems. Automated assisted support enables remote access to sites that need instant problem solving. By automating the collection of information of devices and applications coexisting with the supported application, problems can be quickly detected and fixed. 

Automated self-support, automates the self-support process, freeing users from self-help diagnostics and troubleshooting from [[digital library|on-line libraries]] or knowledge bases.
Support automation solutions can be integrated with [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) systems and [[network management system]]s (NMS), and provide full customer reports to management tallying problems and incidents that were solved mechanically ensuring compliance to industry regulations like [[Sarbanes Oxley]], [[Title 21 CFR Part 11|21 CFR part 11]], and [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]].

===Types===
*'''Proactive Support Automation''' refers to support automation solutions that minimize downtime and enable 24x7 [[availability]]. This is achieved by constant health check tracking with diagnostic procedures to enable issue monitoring and problem solving.
*'''Preemptive Support Automation''' refers to a support solution that utilizes information that is either generated or culled from an application or service, e.g. log files, database queries, configuration changes, etc. This information can then be exploited to predict service degradations or interruptions. The upshot of this is a higher level of service/application availability for the underlying application
*'''Self Support Automation''' is the term organizations give to their support structures that provide on-line libraries and tools for self-help and easy troubleshooting solutions to automatically and precisely diagnose and resolve problems and incidents.
*'''Assisted Support Automation''' is the software that enables support personnel to remotely access their customers desktop or server for diagnostics and trouble ticket resolution.

==Communication Channels==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2017}}
Channels of communication that companies may offer to customers for support:

; Phone support
: Customers speak directly to customer support representatives over the phone. For inbound calls, an IVR (Integrated Voice Response) can be programmed to route captured calls in a variety of ways with the potential goal of quickest resolution of a customer’s request/problem.
: Phone Support is often used for order taking, pre-sales queries, upselling and [[cross-selling]], troubleshooting etc.
: Outbound calls are calls made to customers from the [[call center]] to give or take information. 
; Live chat support
: With live chat support a web visitor seeks assistance, a text chat session is started by clicking on a link on the provider's website. The customer support representative interacts with the web visitor, understands the requirements, resolves the query and closes the interaction. Alternatively, based on the requirements the customer support representative could also trigger a chat session with the web visitor. Live chat support assists with language barriers as both parties involved in the chat session may be able to use an online translation service to communicate. It is also considered less intrusive than phone support.{{POV-statement|date=December 2014}}  Live chat support is often used for lead generation and fulfillment, campaign management, pre-sales and post-sales enquiries, complaint registration, tech support etc.
; Email support
: Email is the primary means to offer web-based assistance for your customers when matters do not require an immediate answer. Low-cost, non-intrusive and anywhere-anytime access are some of the advantages of email-based communications. Trouble Ticketing System and CRM Applications help keep track of a series of follow-up correspondence with a particular customer. Services offered via email response management is claims processing, polling/media analysis, subscription services, troubleshooting, complaint registrations etc.
; Remote support
: Solving problems of a computer at a particular location from a computer at another location is remote support. Companies can save considerable amounts of money on logistics through remote support. IT technicians are empowered with several tools that allow them to gain access to customers’ computers at various parts of the world. They are able to gain access and repair software related problems from remote locations. The need for a technician to visit the customers’ premises is mitigated. With the movement of applications from the desktop to the cloud, newer forms of browser based remote support have developed such as [[Cobrowsing]].
; On-site support
: On-site support is the opposite of remote support. Certain kinds of assistance cannot be rendered remotely, like, hardware related problems. repairing a TV, replacing a spare part, servicing of air conditioners etc. In some occasions, a service provider might choose to take devices or gadgets back to their warehouse for repair.
; Social media
: Since the arrival of social media platforms like [[Facebook]] &amp; [[Twitter]], service providers have found that many of their customers spend plenty of time on them daily. To make it convenient to customers, many service providers have set up a [[webcare]] team as support channel on their social media profiles. Customers are able to ask questions, register complaints, clarify doubts etc. by interacting with the company’s staff through these social media platforms. With millions of users now gaining access to social media, this platform has become as prominent as traditional media like phone, live chat and email.

{{italic title}}
[[File:De architectura.jpg|thumb|right|300px|A 1521 [[Italian language]] edition of ''De architectura'', translated and illustrated by [[Cesare Cesariano]]]]
[[File:De Architectura027.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Manuscript of Vitruvius; parchment dating from about 1390]]
'''{{lang|la|De architectura}}''' ('''''On architecture''''', published as '''''Ten Books on Architecture''''') is a treatise on [[architecture]] written by the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[architect]] and military engineer [[Vitruvius|Marcus Vitruvius Pollio]] and dedicated to his patron, the emperor [[Caesar Augustus]], as a guide for [[Caesar Augustus#Building projects|building projects]]. As the only treatise on architecture to survive from antiquity, it has been regarded since the Renaissance as the first book on architectural theory, as well as a major source on the canon of classical architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Kruft, Hanno-Walter. ''A History of Architectural Theory from Vitruvius to the Present'' (New York, Princeton Architectural Press: 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; It contains a variety of information on Greek and Roman buildings, as well as prescriptions for the planning and design of military camps, cities, and structures both large (aqueducts, buildings, baths, harbours) and small (machines, measuring devices, instruments).&lt;ref&gt;Vitruvius. ''Ten Books on Architecture'', Ed. Ingrid Rowland with illustrations by Thomas Noble Howe (Cambridge, Cambridge University Press: 1999)&lt;/ref&gt;  Since Vitruvius published before the development of cross vaulting, domes, concrete, and other innovations associated with Imperial Roman architecture, his ten books are not regarded as a source of information on these hallmarks of Roman building design and technology.&lt;ref&gt;See William L. MacDonald, ''The Architecture of the Roman Empire: An Introductory Study'' (New Haven, Yale University Press: 1982): 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and contents==
Probably written between 30 and 15 BC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Directory GmbH|url=http://www.vitruvius-pollio.com/|publisher=Vitruvius-pollio.com|accessdate=03-09-2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; it combines the knowledge and views of many antique writers, both Greek and Roman, not only on architecture but on the arts, natural history and building technology. Vitruvius cites many authorities throughout the text, often praising Greek architects for their development of temple building and the orders (Doric, Ionic and Corinthian), and providing key accounts of the origins of building in the primitive hut.

Though often cited for his famous "triad" of characteristics associated with architecture—utilitas, firmitas and venustas (commodity, firmness and delight)--the aesthetic principles that influenced later treatise writers were outlined in Book III. Derived partially from Latin rhetoric (through Cicero and Varro), Vitruvian terms for order, arrangement, proportion, and fitness for intended purposes have guided architects for centuries, and continue to do so today. The Roman author also gave advice on the qualifications of an architect (Book I) and on types of architectural drawing.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance: Vitruvius: ''On Architecture'', edited and translated into English by Frank Granger (Cambridge, Harvard University Press: 1931-34).&lt;/ref&gt;

The ten books or scrolls are organized as follows:

''De architectura'' – ''[[s:Ten Books on Architecture|Ten Books on Architecture]]''

}}
Roman architects were skilled in engineering, art, and craftsmanship combined. Vitruvius was very much of this type, a fact reflected in ''De architectura''. He covered a wide variety of subjects he saw as touching on architecture. This included many aspects that may seem irrelevant to modern eyes, ranging from mathematics to astronomy, meteorology, and medicine. In the Roman conception, architecture needed to take into account everything touching on the physical and intellectual life of man and his surroundings.

Vitruvius, thus, deals with many theoretical issues concerning architecture. For instance, in Book {{roman|2}} of ''De architectura'', he advises architects working with bricks to familiarise themselves with pre-Socratic theories of matter so as to understand how their materials will behave. Book {{roman|9}} relates the abstract [[geometry]] of [[Plato]] to the everyday work of the [[Surveyor (surveying)|surveyor]]. [[Astrology]] is cited for its insights into the organisation of human life, while [[astronomy]] is required for the understanding of [[sundial]]s. Likewise, Vitruvius cites [[Ctesibius|Ctesibius of Alexandria]] and [[Archimedes]] for their inventions, [[Aristoxenus]] ([[Aristotle]]'s apprentice) for music, [[Agatharchus]] for theatre, and [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] for architecture.

===Buildings===
[[File:Greekhse1.jpg|right|thumb|Greek house plan by Vitruvius]]
Vitruvius sought to address the ethos of architecture, declaring that quality depends on the social relevance of the artist's work, not on the form or workmanship of the work itself. Perhaps the most famous declaration from ''De architectura'' is one still quoted by architects:  "Well building hath three conditions: firmness, commodity, and delight."  This quote is taken from Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s version of 1624, and is a plain and accurate translation of the passage in Vitruvius [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Vitruvius/1*.html#3.2 (I.iii.2)]: but English has changed since then, especially in regard to the word "commodity", and the tag is usually misunderstood. A modern interpretation of Wotton's English might render it thus: "The ideal building has three elements; it is sturdy, useful, and beautiful."

Vitruvius also studied human proportions (Book {{roman|3}}) and his ''canones'' were later encoded in a very famous drawing by [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (''Homo Vitruvianus'', "[[Vitruvian Man]]").

==Roman technology==
[[File:ballista.gif|thumb|left|A Roman Ballista]]

[[File:Pont du Gard BLS.jpg|left|thumb|[[Pont du Gard]]]]
''De architectura'' is important for its descriptions of many different machines used for engineering structures, such as hoists, [[Crane (machine)|crane]]s, and [[pulleys]], as well as war machines such as [[catapult]]s, [[ballistae]], and [[siege engine]]s.  Vitruvius also described the construction of sundials and [[water clock]]s, and the use of an [[aeolipile]] (the first [[steam engine]]) as an experiment to demonstrate the nature of atmospheric air movements (wind).

===Aqueducts and mills===
Books {{roman|8}}, {{roman|9}}, and {{roman|10}} of ''De architectura'' form the basis of much of what is known about Roman technology, now augmented by archaeological studies of extant remains, such as the [[Pont du Gard]] in southern France.  Numerous such massive structures occur across the former empire, a testament to the power of [[Roman engineering]].  Vitruvius' description of Roman aqueduct construction is short, but mentions key details especially for the way they were surveyed, and the careful choice of materials needed.

His book would have been of assistance to [[Frontinus]], a general who was appointed in the late 1st century AD to administer the many [[aqueducts of Rome]]. Frontinus wrote ''[[De aquaeductu]]'', the definitive treatise on 1st-century Roman aqueducts, and discovered a discrepancy between the intake and supply of water caused by illegal pipes inserted into the channels to divert the water. The Roman Empire went far in exploiting water power, as the set of no fewer than 16 [[water mill]]s at [[Barbegal]] in France demonstrates. The mills ground grain in a very efficient operation, and many other mills are now known, such as the much later [[Hierapolis sawmill]].

===Materials===
Vitruvius described many different construction materials used for a wide variety of different structures, as well as such details as [[stucco]] painting. [[Cement]], [[concrete]], and [[lime (material)|lime]] received in-depth descriptions, the longevity of many Roman structures being mute testimony to their skill in building materials and design.

Vitruvius advised that [[lead]] should not be used to conduct drinking water, clay pipes being preferred.  He comes to this conclusion in Book {{roman|8}} of ''De architectura'' after empirical observation of the apparent laborer illnesses in the [[plumbum]] foundries of his time. In 1986, the United States banned the use of lead in plumbing due to lead poisoning's neurological damage. However, much of the water used by Rome and many other cities was very hard, and coated the inner surfaces of the pipes, so [[lead poisoning]] was unlikely.
[[File:VitruviusTenBooksMHMorgan1914p295.gif|thumb|right|Design for an Archimedean water-screw]]
Vitruvius related the famous story about Archimedes and his detection of adulterated gold in a royal crown. When Archimedes realized the volume of the crown could be measured exactly by the displacement created in a bath of water, he ran into the street with the cry of [[Eureka (word)|''"Eureka!"'']], and the discovery enabled him to compare the density of the crown with pure gold. He showed the crown had been alloyed with silver, and the king was defrauded.

===Dewatering machines===
[[File:Archscrew2.jpg|left|thumb|Drainage wheel from Rio Tinto mines]]
[[File:WaterwheelsSp.jpg|right|thumb|Sequence of drainage wheels found in Spanish mine]]
Vitruvius described the construction of the [[Archimedes' screw]] in Chapter 10, although did not mention Archimedes by name.  It was a device widely used for raising water to irrigate fields and dewater mines. Other lifting machines mentioned in ''De architectura'' include the endless chain of buckets and the [[reverse overshot water-wheel]]. Remains of the water wheels used for lifting water have been discovered in old mines such as those at [[Rio Tinto (river)|Rio Tinto]] in Spain and [[Dolaucothi]] in west Wales. One of the wheels from Rio Tinto is now in the [[British Museum]], and one from the latter in the [[National Museum of Wales]]. The remains were discovered when these mines were reopened in modern mining attempts. They would have been used in a vertical sequence, with 16 such mills capable of raising water at least {{convert|96|ft|abbr=out}} above the water table. Each wheel would have been worked by a miner treading the device at the top of the wheel, by using cleats on the outer edge. That they were using such devices in mines clearly implies that they were entirely capable of using them as [[water wheels]] to develop power for a range of activities, not just for grinding wheat, but also probably for sawing timber, crushing ores, [[fulling]], and so on.

===Force pump===
[[Ctesibius]] is credited with the invention of the [[force pump]], which Vitruvius described as being built from [[bronze]] with valves to allow a head of water to be formed above the machine. The device is also described by [[Hero of Alexandria]] in his ''Pneumatica''. The machine is operated by hand in moving a lever up and down. He mentioned its use for supplying fountains above a reservoir, although a more mundane use might be as a simple fire engine. One was found at [[Roman Silchester]] or [[Calleva Atrebatum]] in England, and another is on display at the [[British Museum]]. Their functions are not described, but they are both made in bronze, just as Vitruvius specified.

Vitruvius also mentioned the several [[automaton]]s [[Ctesibius]] invented, and intended for amusement and pleasure rather than serving a useful function.

===Central heating===
[[File:Hypocaustum.jpg|thumb|right|Ruins of the hypocaust under the floor of a Roman villa: The part under the ''[[exedra]]'' is covered.]]
Vitruvius described the many innovations made in building design to improve the living conditions of the inhabitants. Foremost among them is the development of the [[hypocaust]], a type of [[central heating]] where hot air developed by a fire was channelled under the floor and inside the walls of [[public bath]]s and [[villa]]s. He gave explicit instructions on how to design such buildings so [[fuel efficiency]] is maximized; for example, the ''[[caldarium]]'' is next to the ''[[tepidarium]]'' followed by the ''[[frigidarium]]''. He also advised using a type of regulator to control the heat in the hot rooms, a bronze disc set into the roof under a circular aperture, which could be raised or lowered by a pulley to adjust the ventilation. Although he did not suggest it himself, his dewatering devices such as the reverse overshot water-wheel likely were used in the larger baths to lift water to header tanks at the top of the larger ''thermae'', such as the [[Baths of Diocletian]] and the [[Baths of Caracalla]].

===Surveying instruments===
That Vitruvius must have been well practised in surveying is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or ''[[chorobates]]'', which he compared favourably with the ''[[groma surveying|groma]]'', a device using [[plumb line]]s. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to the walls of the channel. He described the ''[[Surveyor's wheel|hodometer]]'', in essence a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the [[Peutinger Table]].

===Sea level change===
In Book {{roman|4}} Chapter 1 Subsection 4 of ''De architectura'' is a description of 13 [[Athenian]] cities in [[Asia Minor]], "the land of [[Caria]]", in present-day Turkey. These cities are given as: [[Ephesus]], [[Miletus]], [[Myus]], [[Priene]], [[Samos]], [[Teos]], [[Colophon (city)|Colophon]], [[Chius]], [[Erythrae]], [[Phocaea]], [[Clazomenae]], [[Lebedos]], [[Malta#History|Melite]], and later a 14th, [[Smyrna]]eans. Myus, the third city, is described as being "long ago engulfed by the water, and its sacred rites and suffrage".  This sentence indicates, at the time of Vitruvius's writing, it was known that sea-level change and/or land subsidence occurred. The layout of these cities is in general from south to north so that it appears that where Myrus should be located is inland. If this is the case, then since the writing of ''De architectura'', the region has experienced either soil rebound or a sea-level fall. Though not indicative of sea-level change, or speculation of such, during the later-empire many Roman ports suffered from what contemporary writers described as 'silting'. The constant need to dredge ports became a heavy burden on the treasury and some have speculated that this expense significantly contributed to the eventual collapse of the empire. Roman salt works in Essex County, England, today are located at the five-metre contour, implying this was the coastline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gilman, Paul |title="Securing a Future for Essex's Past" Heritage Conservation Planning Division, Essex County Council England|publisher=Esri.com|url=http://www.esri.com/news/arcuser/1099/essex.html|accessdate=2008-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Survival and rediscovery==
Vitruvius' work is one of many examples of Latin texts that owe their survival to the palace ''[[scriptorium]]'' of [[Charlemagne]] in the early 9th century. (This activity of finding and recopying classical [[manuscript]]s is part of what is called the [[Carolingian Renaissance]].) Many of the surviving manuscripts of Vitruvius' work derive from an existing manuscript that was written there, [[British Library]] manuscript Harley 2767.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/illuminatedmanuscripts/record.asp?MSID=8557&amp;CollID=8&amp;NStart=2767 |title=Details of an item from the British Library Catalogue of Illuminated Manuscripts |publisher=Bl.uk |date=2003-11-30 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These texts were not just copied, but also known at the court of Charlemagne, since his historian, bishop [[Einhard]], asked the visiting English churchman [[Alcuin]] for explanations of some technical terms.  In addition, a number of individuals are known to have read the text or have been indirectly influenced by it, including: Vussin, [[Hrabanus Maurus]], [[Hermann of Reichenau]], [[Hugo of St. Victor]], Gervase of Melkey, [[William of Malmesbury]], Theoderich of St. Trond, [[Peter the Deacon|Petrus Diaconus]], [[Albertus Magnus]], [[Filippo Villani]], [[Jean de Montreuil]], [[Petrarch]], [[Boccaccio]], [[Giovanni de Dondi]], Domenico di Bandino, [[Niccolò Acciaioli]] bequeathed copy to the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence]], [[Bernward of Hildesheim]], and [[St. Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Many copies of ''De architectura'', dating from the 8th to the 15th centuries, did exist in manuscript form during the [[Middle Ages]] and 92 are still available in public collections, but they appear to have received little attention, possibly due to the obsolescence of many specialized Latin terms used by Vitruvius {{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} and the loss of most of the original 10 illustrations thought by some to be helpful in understanding parts of the text.

Vitruvius' work was "rediscovered" in 1414 by the [[Florence|Florentine]] [[Humanism|humanist]] [[Poggio Bracciolini]], who found it in the Abbey of [[St Gallen]], Switzerland. He publicized the manuscript to a receptive audience of [[Renaissance]] thinkers, just as interest in the classical cultural and scientific heritage was reviving.
[[File:De Architectura030.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Vitruvian Man]]'', illustration in the edition of ''De architectura'' by Vitruvius; illustrated edition by Cesare Cesariano (1521)]]

The first printed edition (''editio princeps''), an ''[[incunabula]]'' version,  was published by the [[Verona|Veronese]] scholar [[Fra Giovanni Sulpitius]] in 1486 (with a second edition in 1495 or 1496), but none were illustrated. The [[Dominican friar]] [[Fra Giovanni Giocondo]] produced the first version illustrated with [[woodcut]]s in [[Venice]] in 1511. It had a thorough philosophical approach and superb illustrations.

Translations into Italian were in circulation by the 1520s, the first in print being the translation with new illustrations by [[Cesare Cesariano]], a Milanese friend of the architect [[Bramante]], printed in [[Como]] in 1521. It was rapidly translated into other European languages{{spaced ndash}}the first German version was published in 1528{{spaced ndash}}and the first French versions followed in 1547 (but contained many mistakes). The first Spanish translation was published in 1582 by Miguel de Urrea and Juan Gracian. The most authoritative and influential edition was publicized in French in 1673 by [[Claude Perrault]], commissioned by [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] in 1664.

The first English translation followed in 1692, although [[John Shute (architect)|John Shute]] had drawn on the text as early as 1563 for his book ''The First and Chief Grounds of Architecture''. The 1692 translation was an abridgment based on the French version of Claude Perrault.  English-speakers had to wait until 1771 for a full translation of the first five volumes and 1791 for the whole thing. Sir [[Henry Wotton]]'s 1624 version ''The Elements of Architecture'' was more of a free adaptation than a literal translation, while a 1692 translation was much abbreviated. Thanks to the art of printing, Vitruvius' work had become a popular subject of [[hermeneutics]], with highly detailed and interpretive illustrations, and became widely dispersed.

==Impact==
[[File:Da Vinci Vitruve Luc Viatour.jpg|thumb|''Vitruvian man'', Leonardo da Vinci, (c. 1485-90)]]
The rediscovery of Vitruvius' work had a profound influence on architects of the [[Renaissance]], prompting the rebirth of Classical architecture in subsequent centuries. Renaissance architects, such as [[Niccoli]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] and [[Leon Battista Alberti]], found in ''De architectura'' their rationale for raising their branch of knowledge to a [[scientific discipline]] as well as emphasising the skills of the [[artisan]].  [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s  best known drawing, ''the [[Vitruvian man]]'', is based on the concepts of proportion developed by Vitruvius.

The English architect [[Inigo Jones]] and the Frenchman [[Salomon de Caus]] were among the first to re-evaluate and implement those disciplines that Vitruvius considered a necessary element of architecture: arts and [[science]]s based upon number and [[proportion (architecture)]]. The 16th-century architect [[Palladio]] considered Vitruvius his master and guide, and made some drawings based on Vitruvius' work before conceiving his own architectural precepts.

===Astrolabe===
The earliest evidence of use of the [[stereographic projection]] in a machine is in ''De architectura'' which describes an anaphoric clock (it is presumed, a clepsydra or [[water clock]]) in Alexandria. The clock had a rotating field of stars behind a wire frame indicating the hours of the day. The wire framework (the spider) and the star locations were constructed using the stereographic projection. Similar constructions dated from the 1st to 3rd centuries have been found in Salzburg and northeastern France, so such mechanisms were, it is presumed, fairly widespread among Romans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15248">'''Desiccation tolerance''' refers to the ability of an organism to withstand or endure extreme dryness, or [[drought]]-like conditions. Plants and animals living in arid or periodically arid environments such as temporary streams or ponds may face the challenge of desiccation, therefore physiological or behavioral [[adaptation]]s to withstand these periods are necessary to ensure survival.  In particular, [[insects]] occupy a wide range of ecologically diverse niches and, so, exhibit a variety of strategies to avoid desiccation.

In general, desiccation resistance in insects is measured by the change in mass during dry conditions.&lt;ref name=Chownetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Chown, S.L., |author2=Nicolson, S.W. |title=Insect Physiological Ecology|journal=New York: Oxford University Press |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The overall mass difference between measurements before and after aridity exposure is attributed to body water loss, as respiratory water loss is generally considered negligible.

==Types of desiccation resistance==
There are three main ways in which insects can increase their tolerance to desiccation: by increasing their total body water content; by reducing the rate of body water loss; and by tolerating a larger proportion of overall water loss from the body.&lt;ref name=Chownetal/&gt;  Survival time is determined by initial water content, and can be calculated by dividing water loss tolerance (the maximum amount of water that may be removed without resulting in death) by water loss rate.&lt;ref name=Chownetal/&gt;

===Increasing body water content===
Insects with a higher initial body water content have better survival rates during arid conditions than insects with a lower initial body water content.&lt;ref name=Greyetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gray, E.M. |author2=Bradley, T.J. |title=Physiology of desiccation resistance in Anopheles gambiae and Anopheles arabiensis |journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene |volume=73 |pages=553–559 |year=2005 |pmid=16172480 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Higher amounts of internal body water lengthen the time necessary to remove the amount of water required to kill the organism.  The way in which body water content is increased may differ depending on the [[species]].

The accumulation of [[glycogen]] during the insect larval stage has been linked to increased body water content and is likely a source of metabolic water during dry conditions.&lt;ref name=Gravesetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Graves, J. L. |author2=Toolson, E. C. |author3=Jeong, C.; Vu |author4=L.N.; Rose, M.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Desiccation, flight, glycogen and postponed senescence in Drosophila melanogaster |journal=Physiological Zoology |volume=65 |pages=268–286 |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Glycogen, a [[glucose]] [[polysaccharide]], acts as an oxidative energy source during times of physiological stress.  Because it binds up to five times its weight in bulk water, insects with increased levels of body glycogen also have higher amounts of internal water.&lt;ref name=Greyetal/&gt;  In general, insects selected for desiccation resistance also exhibit longer larval stages than those sensitive to desiccation.&lt;ref name=Gefenetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Gefen, E. |author2=Marlon, A.J. |author3=Gibbs, A.G. |title=Selection for desiccation resistance in adult Drosophila melanogaster affects larval development and metabolite accumulation |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=209 |pages=3293–3300 |year=2006 |pmid=16916965 |issue=Pt 17 |doi=10.1242/jeb.02397}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This increase in development time is likely a response to the environment, allowing larvae more time to accumulate glycogen, and therefore more water before [[eclosion]].

Another possible source contributing to higher levels of initial body water in insects is [[hemolymph]] volume.  The insect equivalent to blood, hemolymph is the fluid found within the [[hemocoel]], and is the largest pool of extracellular water within the insect body.&lt;ref name=Folketal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Folk, D.G. |author2=Han, C. |author3=Bradley, T.J. |title=Water acquisition and partitioning in Drosophila melanogaster: effects of selection for desiccation-resistance |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=204 |pages=3323–3331 |year=2001 |pmid=11606606 |issue=Pt 19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fruit-fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'', flies selected for desiccation resistance also yielded higher amounts of hemolymph.  Higher hemolymph volume is linked to an increase in [[carbohydrate]]s, in particular [[trehalose]], a common sugar found in many plants and animals with high desiccation resistance.&lt;ref name=Folketal/&gt;  ''Drosophila melanogaster'' flies selected for desiccation resistance show a 300% increase in hemolymph volume compared to control flies, correlating to a similar increase in trehalose levels.&lt;ref name=Folketal/&gt;  During periods of aridity, cells dehydrate and draw upon hemolymph stores to replenish intracellular water; therefore, insects with higher levels of this fluid are less prone to desiccation.

Insects may also increase body water content by simply feeding more often.  Because sugar is slowly absorbed into the hemolymph at each meal, increasing the frequency at which the insect ingests a sugar source also increases its desiccation tolerance.&lt;ref name=Greyetal/&gt;  Furthermore, the [[crop (anatomy)|crop]] may also act not only to store food prior to digestion but to provide an additional reservoir for water and sugar.&lt;ref name=Greyetal/&gt;

===Reducing rate of water loss===
Another strategy used to reduce the risk of death by dehydration is to reduce the rate at which water is lost. The three main ways through which insects can lose water are (1) the surface of the body ([[integument]]); (2) the [[Invertebrate trachea|tracheae]] (respiration); and (3) [[excretion]], or waste products.&lt;ref name=Mellanby&gt;{{cite journal |author=Mellanby, K. |title=The evaporation of water from insects |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=10 |pages=317–333 |year=1934 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.1935.tb00487.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The important feature in reducing water loss in [[land snail]]s during inactivity is an [[epiphragm]].&lt;ref&gt;Machin J. 1968. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1539969 ''The Permeability of the Epiphragm of Terrestrial Snails to Water Vapor'']. Biological Bulletin, Vol. 134, No. 1 (Feb., 1968), pp. 87-95&lt;/ref&gt;

====Integument====
The [[exoskeleton]] or integument of insects acts as an impermeable, protective layer against desiccation.  It is composed of an outer [[epicuticle]], underlain by an [[procuticle]] that itself may be further divided into an exo- and endocuticle.&lt;ref name=Wigglesworth&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wigglesworth, V.B. |title=Insect Physiology |journal=Chapman and Hall, NY. |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The endocuticle provides the insect with toughness and flexibility and the hard exocuticle serves to protect vulnerable body parts.  However, the outer cuticular layer (epicuticle) is a protein-polyphenol complex made up of [[lipoprotein]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, and waxy molecules, and is the insect’s primary defense against water loss.  Many insect orders secrete an additional cement layer over their wax layer, likely to protect against the abrasion or removal of waxy molecules.  This layer is composed of lipids and proteins held together by [[polyphenol]]ic compounds and is secreted by the [[dermis|dermal]] glands.

In general, the rate of water loss in insects is low at moderate temperatures.  Once a species-specific critical temperature (Tc) is reached, as temperatures continue to increase, rapid water loss occurs.  The “[[lipid]] melting model” is used to explain this sudden increase in the rate of water loss.&lt;ref name=Gibbs&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0022-1910(02)00059-8 |author=Gibbs, A.G. |title=Lipid melting and cuticular permeability: new insights into an old problem |journal=Journal of Insect Physiology |volume=48 |pages=391–400 |year=2002 |pmid=12770088 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lipid melting model states that increased cuticular water loss is directly related to the melting of surface lipids.&lt;ref name=Gibbs/&gt;   Insects already adapted to more arid environments have a higher Tc; that is, their cuticular properties change and lipid structures melt at a higher critical temperature.&lt;ref name=Gibbs/&gt;

In some insects, the rate of cuticular water loss is controlled to some extent by the [[neuroendocrine]] system.&lt;ref name=Trehernetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Treherne, J.E. |author2=Willmer, P.G. |title=Hormonal control of integumentary water loss: evidence for a novel neuroendocrine system in an insect (Periplaneta americana) |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=63 |pages=143–159 |year=1975 |pmid=1159358 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Immediately following head removal, decapitated cockroaches exhibit a large increase in [[transpiration]] across the cuticle, leading to severe dehydration. Injection of brain [[hormone]]s into freshly separated bodies results in a sharp reduction in cuticular water loss.&lt;ref name=Trehernetal/&gt;

====Tracheae====
In general, insects adapted to arid environments also have an impermeable cuticular membrane that prevents water loss.  Therefore, a majority of water lost to the atmosphere occurs via the air-filled tracheae.&lt;ref name=Snyderetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Snyder, G.K. |author2=Sheafor, B. |author3=Scholnick, D. |author4=Farrelly, C. |title=Gas Exchange in the Insect Tracheal System |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=172 |pages=199–207 |year=1995 |pmid=7715192 |issue=3 |doi=10.1006/jtbi.1995.0016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To help reduce water loss, many insects have outer coverings to their tracheae, or [[spiracle]]s, which shut when open [[respiration (physiology)|respiration]] is unnecessary and prevent water from escaping.  Insects at a greater risk for water loss face the challenge of either a depleted oxygen supply or desiccation, leading to an adaptive increase in tracheal volume in order to receive more oxygen.&lt;ref name=Snyderetal/&gt;

====Excretion====
Following feeding, most insects retain enough water to completely hydrate their bodies, excreting the remainder.&lt;ref name=Bursell&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bursell, E. |title=Loss of water by excretion and defaecation in the Tsetse fly |journal=Experimental Biology |volume=37 |pages=689–697 |year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the amount of water excreted differs between species, and depends on the relative humidity and dryness of the environment.  For example, [[Tsetse flies]] maintained at a high relative humidity, and thus non-arid conditions, excrete fecal matter with approximately 75% water content, whereas Tsetse flies maintained at a low relative humidity, and thus dry conditions, excrete fecal matter with only 35% water content.&lt;ref name=Bursell/&gt;  This adaptation helps minimize water loss in unfavorable conditions and increase chances of survival.

===Tolerating greater water loss===
Most insects can tolerate a 30-50% loss of body water; however, insects adapted to dry environments can tolerate a 40-60% loss of body water.&lt;ref name=Willmeretal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Willmer, P. |author2=Stone, G. |author3=Johnston, I.A. |title=Environmental physiology of animals |journal=New York: Blackwell Publishing |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initial body size also plays a large role in how much water loss can be tolerated, and, in general, larger insects can tolerate a larger percentage of body water loss than smaller insects.&lt;ref name=Renaultetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Renault, D. |author2=Coray, Y. |title=Water loss of male and female Alphitobius diaperinus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae) maintained under dry conditions |journal=European Journal of Entomology |volume=101 |pages=491–494 |year=2004 |doi=10.14411/eje.2004.069}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The female beetle ''Alphitobius diaperinus'', for example, is larger than its male counterpart and can thus tolerate 4% more water loss.  It is hypothesized that larger insects have increased lipid reserves, preventing dehydration and desiccation.&lt;ref name=Renaultetal/&gt;

==Behavior modification==
In addition to physiological adaptations that increase desiccation resistance, behavioral responses of insects to arid environments significantly decrease dehydration potential.  ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' fruit flies, for example, will actively move to areas with higher atmospheric water content when placed in dry environments.&lt;ref name=Princeetal&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1071/ZO9770285 |author1=Prince, G.J. |author2=Parsons, P.A. |title=Adaptive Behaviour of Drosophila Adults in Relation to Temperature and Humidity |journal=Australian Journal of Zoology |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=285–290 |year=1977}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the [[dung beetle]] buries food in underground chambers, thereby ensuring water and energy sources during periodically dry conditions.&lt;ref name=Halffteretal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Halffter, G. |author2=Edmonds, W.D. |title=The Nesting Behavior of Dung Beetles (Scarabaeinae) an Ecological and Evolutive Approach |journal=Mexico D.F.: Instituto de Ecologia |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feeding location may also be altered to ensure body hydration.  Some caterpillars preferentially feed on the underside of leaves, where microclimate has higher relative humidity.&lt;ref name=Rowleyetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rowley, M. |author2=Hanson, F. |title=Humidity detection and hygropreference behavior in larvae of the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta |journal=Journal of Insect Science |volume=7 |pages=39 |year=2007 |doi=10.1673/031.007.3901 |pmid=20302460 |pmc=2999434}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a highly time-consuming activity such as feeding, these insects significantly reduce their chances of desiccation.

==Cryptobiosis (Anhydrobiosis)==
[[Cryptobiosis]] refers to the state of an organism that has no detectable metabolic activity, resulting from extreme and unfavorable environmental conditions; anhydrobiosis refers to the state of surviving the loss of (almost) all body water.  Although this state is commonly observed in invertebrates, only one insect is known to be cryptobiotic (anhydrobiotic), the African [[chironomid]] ''[[Polypedilum vanderplanki]]''.  ''Polypedilum vanderplanki'' undergoes [[anhydrobiosis]], a cryptobiotic state wherein the body is completely dehydrated.   The larvae of ''P. vanderplanki'' inhabit rock pools that commonly dry out completely.&lt;ref name=Watanebeetal&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Watanbe, M. |author2=Kikawada, T. |author3=Okuda, T. |title=Increase of internal ion concentration triggers trehalose synthesis associated with cryptobiosis in larvae of Polypedilum vanderplanki |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=206 |pages=2281–2286 |year=2003 | url = http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/full/206/13/2281 | pmid=12771176 |doi=10.1242/jeb.00418 |issue=Pt 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response, ''P. vanderplanki'' larvae enter an anhydrobiotic state, during which changes in body osmolarity trigger the production of large amounts of trehalose.  Due to its capacity for water replacement and [[Cryopreservation#Vitrification|vitrification]], the accumulation of trehalose prevents the death of the larvae from water loss.&lt;ref name=Watanebeetal/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Disaster Informatics''' or '''crisis informatics''' is the study of the use of information and technology in the preparation, mitigation, response and recovery phases of disasters and other emergencies. It began to emerge as a field after the successful use of a variety of technologies in disasters including the [[Asian tsunami]], [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11th]] and [[Hurricane katrina|Hurricane Katrina]].

Disaster informatics may involve incorporating [[social media]] content generated by people in disaster zones into humanitarian response plans based on [[satellite imagery]] and official [[emergency services]] procedures. Disaster informatics may involve [[crowdsourcing]], [[Participatory GIS|participatory mapping]] or [[citizen science]], with  members of the public as 'everyday analysts'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Palen |first=Leysia|authorlink= Leysia Palen |year=2010 |title=A vision for technology-mediated support for public participation &amp; assistance in mass emergencies &amp; disasters |url=https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/computingvisionspaper.pdf |accessdate=19 August 2014 |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111352/https://www.cs.colorado.edu/~palen/computingvisionspaper.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}

The term was first used in a [[request for proposal]] response by D. E. Yarrington after the WTC communications problems were revealed. Subsequently, in 2002, a grant proposal was submitted to the [[National Institutes of Health]]/[[United States National Library of Medicine|National Library of Medicine]] to begin the formal study of disaster informatics as it related to public health. This initiative emerged from her library and information science work at [[Jackson State University]].

'''Environmental consulting''' is often a form of [[compliance (regulation)|compliance]] [[Consultant|consulting]], in which the consultant ensures that the client maintains an appropriate measure of compliance with [[environmental regulation]]s. There are many types of environmental consultants, but the two main groups are those who enter the field from the industry side, and those who enter the field from the [[environmentalist]] side.

Environmental consultants work in a very wide variety of fields. Whether it be providing [[construction]] services such as [[Asbestos]] Hazard Assessments or Lead Hazard Assessments or conducting due [[diligence]] reports for customers to rid them of possible sanctions. Consultancies may generalize across a wide range of disciplines or specialize in certain areas of environmental consultancy such as [[waste management]].

Environmental consultants usually have an [[undergraduate degree]] and sometimes even [[master's degree]] in [[Environmental Engineering]], [[Environmental Science]], [[Environmental Studies]], [[Geology]], or some other science discipline. They should have deep knowledge on environmental regulations, which they can advise particular clients in the private industry or public government institutions to help them steer clear of possible fines, legal action or misguided transactions.

Environmental consulting spans a wide spectrum of industry. The most basic industry that environmental consulting remains prominent in is the commercial estate market. Many commercial lenders rely on both small and large environmental firms. Many commercial lenders will not lend monies to borrowers if the property or personal capital does not exceed the worth of the land. If an environmental problem is discovered property owners that deem themselves a responsible party will most likely reserve monies in escrow in order to resolve the environmental impact.

With increasing numbers of construction, [[agriculture]], and scientific companies employing environmental consultancies, the industry can expect growth in the vicinity of 9.7 percent in 2008, amidst mounting public concern over [[environmental degradation]] and climate change. And while some companies are genuinely motivated by concern for the environment, for others, hiring consultants to appear to be "going green" has proven to be a useful marketing tool. Growing government funding into renewable energy and technologies producing low emissions is also helping growth, as organizations investing in research and development in these areas are often major employers of environmental consultants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-technology-1/The-Recession-List---Top-10-Industries-to-Fly-and-Flop-in-2008-4076-4/ The Recession List - Top 10 Industries to Fly and Fl... (or growth together with growth inNorth A...)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subdisciplines==

There are numerous areas in which environmental consultants might work (in no particular order):

'''Contaminated Land''' is one area as mentioned above. [[Contaminated land|Contaminated Land]] this may well involve a [[Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment]]

'''Energy''' may entail feasibility studies for renewable energy projects. For example, a study may attempt to answer the question: Would a micro-hydro-generation scheme pay for itself over the course of its operational life?

'''Geotechnical''' may also be covered by Environmental Consultants, this might include activities such as [[site investigation]]s, geotechnical engineering (foundation design, slope stability), and restoration [[quality assurance]].

'''Environmental Management Systems''' such as [[ISO 14001]] are large complicated systems that are often not implemented using internal man/woman power. This work is usually outsourced to consultants.

'''Green Claims''' Environmental Consultants may be employed to substantiate green claims, such as eco labels, which may involve work on supply chain or embodied carbon.

'''Compliance''' As governments become more and more environmental in their thinking, so does their legal framework. In the UK, businesses are covered by numerous pieces of legislation such as oil storage regulations and The Environment Act. If they are found to be in breach of these regulations they may face severe civil or criminal actions. Environmental Consultants can check to see that the business in question is in compliance with current legislation.

'''Impact Assessment''' see [[Environmental impact statement]]

'''[[Flood risk assessment|Flood Risk]]''', the most common of which may be a Phase 1 Screening Study.

'''[[Asbestos]] Management'''

'''[[Radon]]'''

'''Carbon''' there are various aspects of a company's carbon foot print that may be managed by consultants. They may have internal reduction strategies, or they may be tied in with national targets. Emissions trading is also an important aspect of Carbon Management.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7376">'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' is an annual promotional campaign which happens once every year, organized and funded by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] to increase awareness of Fairtrade products. It makes use of volunteers who support the goals of Fairtrade but who may also be committed to the more general concepts of fair trade, ethical trading or concerned by development issues. The concept was pioneered by the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the [[United Kingdom]], initially held in 1997 in Scotland and directed by [[Barnaby Miln]].

The inaugural national launch was on 12 February 1997&lt;ref&gt;Herald, 13 February 1997, Retailing by Simon Bain&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Evening News, 14 February 1997, Shop around for fair trade by John Vidal&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Augustine United Church]] on [[Edinburgh]]'s George IV Bridge by Lady [[Marion Fraser]], chairman of the charity [[Christian Aid]]. She broke a bar of Fairtrade chocolate to launch the event. It turned out to be a highly successful campaign to get every supermarket throughout Scotland&lt;ref&gt;Life and Work magazine, March 1997, Pester power puts fairness into focus&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scottish Episcopalian, April 1997, page 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christian Aid News, April/June 1997, Pester power rules! page 12&lt;/ref&gt; to stock Fairtrade products. Barnaby Miln sent supporters of Christian Aid Scotland, [[SCIAF]], [[Traidcraft]], [[Oxfam]] and the [[World Development Movement]] a list of 85 supermarkets in Scotland's cities and larger towns, and encouraged during the Fortnight to go and ask for Fairtrade products.

'''Fairtrade Fortnight''' spread to the rest of the United Kingdom the following year; today, Fairtrade Fortnights are celebrated in several countries, most notably [[Ireland]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Awareness raising and promotion of [[Fairtrade labelling|Fairtrade certified products]] to the public are the main objectives of the Fortnight.

Usually events held during the fortnight include:
* Fetes
* Fairs
* [[Fairtrade]] food and drink tastings,
* Fashion shows
* Community, school, college and university events

These events are often supported by local authorities and governments, Fairtrade Steering Groups, dozens of [[charities]] and [[Alternative trading organization|ATOs]], all seeking to ensure that the local populace purchase fair and ethically traded goods. Local schools and colleges where Fairtrade is a frequently discussed topic can also play significant roles during Fairtrade Fortnight.

Events are highlighted and recorded on various nations' Fairtrade licensing bodies' websites (e.g. the [[Fairtrade Foundation]] in the UK or [[Fairtrade Canada]]). Most media outlets are keen to support a fast-growing trend in which previously disadvantaged third world producers have a fairer market to sell their wares and develop their economic capabilities.

'''In 2018 Fairtrade Fortnight is celebrated from 28 February to 11 March.'''

==Criticism of Fairtrade==
{{Main|Fair trade debate}}

Critics in the [[Fair trade debate]] claim that some volunteers can have an incorrect view of Fairtrade, because the information is concealed from them,&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, P. (2012),  “Ethical Objections to Fairtrade”, Journal of Business Ethics (2012) 105:357–373 DOI 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm, Accessed 2 February 2012; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; in particular that the evidence that little or none of the extra amount paid by consumers always reaches the producers,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Valkila, J., Haaparanta, P., &amp; Niemi, N.

Nicholls, A. and C. Opal (2005), Fair Trade: Market-Driven Ethical Consumption, London: Sage.;
Sellers, F. S. (2005), ‘Gift-wrapped guilt?’, Washington Post, 18 December.;
&lt;/ref&gt; and an alleged lack of evidence that Fairtrade has a positive impact on Third World producers.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Griffiths, P., ‘Ethical objections to Fairtrade’ Journal of Business Ethics July 2011(DOI) 10.1007/s10551-011-0972-0 www.springerlink.com Accessed at http://www.griffithsspeaker.com/Fairtrade/why_fair_trade_isn.htm; Mohan, S. (2010). Fair Trade Without the Froth - a dispassionate economic analysis of 'Fair Trade'. London: Institute of Economic Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; This argument is now largely obsolete as FLO-CERT, the Fairtrade Foundation and other nations' representative organisations and overseas development agencies continue to publish commodity reports and market analyses clearly indicating the benefits of the Fairtrade certification scheme over standard free market trade.

Using volunteers who allegedly do not understand the facts has in the past been criticised by Messrs. Davies and Crane&lt;ref&gt;Davies, I.A. and A Crane, ‘Andrew Crane Ethical Decision Making in Fair Trade Companies’, Journal of Business Ethics 45: 79–92, 2003. P84&lt;/ref&gt; in their report that The Day Chocolate Company, "made considerable use of unpaid volunteer workers for routine tasks, many of whom seemed to be under the (false) impression that they were helping out a charity. Not only might one question the sometimes quite excessive use of unpaid labour in a for-profit organisation, but the management team at Day appeared to have no intention of correcting the obvious misapprehensions of the volunteers. However, this did not appear to be acknowledged as a potential ethical problem at Day."

Fairtrade International and The Fairtrade Foundation produce a significant volume of information and resources for volunteers and interested people who wish to learn more about all aspects of the Fairtrade framework, in addition to more in-depth commodity reports and market analyses across all commodity sectors where it licenses products.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75682">'''Financial Gerontology''' is a multidisciplinary field of study encompassing both academic and professional education, that integrates research on aging and human development with the concerns of finance and business. Following from its roots in [[social gerontology]], Financial Gerontology is not simply the study of ''old people'' but emphasizes the '''multiple processes''' of aging. In particular, research and teaching in financial gerontology draws upon ''four kinds of aging'' or "'four lenses" through which aging and finance can be viewed: '''population aging''', '''individual aging''', '''family aging''', and '''generational aging'''.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, N. E., ''Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning.'' Wiley 2002, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is problematic that "demography is destiny," demographic concepts, issues, and data play a substantial role in understanding the dynamics of financial gerontology. For example, through the lens of population aging, demography identifies the number of persons of different ages in cities and countries—and at multiple points in time. Through the lens of individual aging, demography also notes changes in the length of time--number of years lived in older age, typically measured by increases in life expectancy. From in its founding years in the beginning of the 21st century, one primary interest of Financial Gerontology has been on [[baby boomer]]s and their relationships with their parents. The impact of these two kinds of aging on finance are reasonably apparent. The large and increasing number of older persons  [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[population aging]]] in a society, no matter how "old age" is defined, and the longer each of these persons lives [individual aging], the greater the impact on a society's pattern of [[retirement]], public and private [[pension]] systems, health, health care, and the [[health care finance in the United States|personal and societal financing of health care]]. The focus on boomers illustrates also the other two lenses or "kinds" of aging. How boomers deal with the social, emotional, and financial aspects of their parents' aging is a central aspect of [[Family support|family aging.]] And how boomers may differ from their parents born and raised twenty to forty years earlier, and differ from their Generation X and Millennial children and grandchildren, are substantial aspects of [[Theory of generations|generational]] aging.

== Origins of Financial Gerontology ==
=== The Educational Vision ===
The origins of Financial Gerontology reflect the vision of two business professionals, Joseph Boettner, a successful insurance salesman and entrepreneur, and Davis Gregg, a successful business educator and administrator. Boettner was born in 1903 and left West Philadelphia High School to work in the city's booming insurance industry. Building from a successful career in sales he purchased the failing Philadelphia Life Insurance Company (for $1 per share), and established it as a successful company. Boettner's post-high school education was with the American College of Life Underwriters, then an insurance education program within the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business &amp; Finance; he earned his Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation in 1934. Born in 1918, Gregg graduated from the University of Texas and earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1947, where he studied under the legendary professor of insurance [[Solomon S. Huebner|Solomon Huebner]], the founder of the American College of Life Underwriters and considered by many to be the "father of insurance education"&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M.F., ''The Teacher Who Changed an Industry,'' Richard D. Irwin Inc, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg was on the faculty of Stanford University when Huebner asked him to come to the insurance college in Philadelphia for a short time. The "short time" became four decades including thirty years (1954 to 1983) as the college's president.

Combining his wealth and continuing interest in financial education, Boettner made several investments in higher education, including endowing academic chairs primarily in the realm of life insurance programs. As both his business perspectives and his experience with personal aging evolved, however, his views about the educational needs of the insurance industry also changed. Although his own resources allowed him to respond successfully to the financial challenges of aging, he became increasingly concerned about how the average person can deal with aging and, of equal significance, how educational programs could be created to respond to the needs and concerns of aging persons.  Over the years Gregg's intellectual experience as dean and president encouraged him to expand the college's distance education curriculum beyond the CLU designation which focused substantially on life insurance. Under his leadership the college developed a second professional designation, the [[Chartered Financial Consultant|Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC)]] whose approach included financial planning courses beyond life insurance .

By the 1980s Boettner's concerns about personal aging and financial education began to merge with Gregg's views on the need for more comprehensive professional education in the expanding field of financial services. A result of these joint concerns was the concept and a plan for a new research institute that would focus on the interconnections among social gerontology and personal finance. With a small gift from Boettner, Gregg convened a study committee of nationally known gerontologists which, after two years of assessment, agreed on four organizing principles: (1) that there was in fact a need for specialized research that integrates gerontology and financial planning; (2) that a social gerontology research center could succeed at a small specialized business school; (3) that the permanent director of the institute should be an experienced gerontologist because the financial side of the relationship would be provided by the business school's faculty; and (4) that the new institute would be communicating gerontological concerns to financial professionals and financial concerns to gerontologists.

=== The Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology ===
On July 4, 1986 [[The American College of Financial Services|American College]] established the Boettner Research Institute under Gregg's supervision. Its first permanent director was Dr. Neal E. Cutler, a professor of political science and gerontology, recruited in 1989 from the University of Southern California's [[USC Davis School of Gerontology|Andrus Gerontology Center]]. A challenge of the new leadership team was to create a more content-descriptive name for the institute. A pensions or retirement institute was considered, but this was somewhat narrower than the mandate of the new institute; further, the Wharton School at the nearby University of Pennsylvania already had a well-established Pensions Research Council. More critically, the new institute was to be unique in emphasizing the contributions of gerontology to a broad range of academic fields and financial professionals. Fortunately, as models there are several well-recognized gerontological interdisciplinary sub-fields, including biological gerontology, social gerontology, occupational gerontology, and recreational gerontology; and the phrase "financial gerontology" was starting to be seen in professional publications.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, D.W., "Introducing Financial Gerontology," ''Journal of the American Society of CLU &amp; ChFC'', November 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in 1990 "Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology" was chosen as the official name in order both to create new sub-fields in both gerontology and in finance, and to describe and communicate the institute's scope of academic and professional education and research.

The initial professional and public recognition of the significance of Financial Gerontology was substantial, and to some extent exceeded the expectations of its organizers and advisers. In response, the desirability of a broader set of academic supports than originally planned was identified. In 1992 the Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology became chartered as a nonprofit charitable educational corporation with an independently appointed board of trustees of prominent business and gerontology academics and practitioners. The same year, the trustees voted to move the institute from The American College and accept an invitation to become affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania School of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Vitt, L.A and Siegenthaler, J.A (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Financial Gerontology,'' Greenwood Press 1996, "Boettner Center of Financial Gerontology," pp.51-55&lt;/ref&gt; In order to establish that the foundations of Financial Gerontology were both to learn from and speak to the disciplines of gerontology and financial services, the Boettner Institute organized a series of published lectures given by renown experts in the "two sides" of Financial Gerontology. The inaugural lecture was given in 1997 by Dr. George L. Maddox, Director of the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development: "Age and Well-Being." Other lectures included:
Dr. William C. Greenough, CEO of [[TIAA|TIAA-CREF]] and developer of the variable-annuity stock fund: "Critical Policy Issues for Pensions" (1989).
Dr. [[Matilda White Riley]], Director of the Office of Social and Behavioral Science, National Institute of Aging: "Aging in the Twenty-first Century" (1990).
Dr. Davis W. Gregg, Founding Director of the Boettner Institute: "The Human Wealth Span: A Life Span View of Financial Well-Being" (1992).
Dr. [[James Birren|James E. Birren]], psychologist and founding director of the [[USC Davis School of Gerontology|USC Andrus Gerontology Center]]: "Information and Consumer Decisions-Making: Maintaining Resources and Independence"(1994).
Dallas L. Salisbury, CEO of the [[Employee Benefit Research Institute]]: "Recent Trends in Pensions, Benefits, and Retirement: In-House Research" (1995).

In keeping with its established academic naming practices, the University of Pennsylvania renamed the Institute as the Boettner Center of Financial Gerontology. In 2003 the Center was moved into the university's Wharton School as the Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Research affiliated with the business school's [[Olivia S. Mitchell|Pension Research Council]], under the direction of Dr. Olivia S. Mitchell. The Wharton School is also home to one of the two (see below) Boettner-funded endowed chairs in Financial Gerontology.

== Financial Gerontology as Academic Teaching and Research ==

===The Human Wealth Span===
Early Financial Gerontology research focused on the interaction of (and longitudinal trends in) middle-aging and older-aging, and their combined impact on savings, retirement, health care, and long-term care. Research on aging and money often juxtaposes '''''old age''''' with the adequacy of financial resources ([[pension]]s, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and a variety of [[Retirement plans in the United States|savings and investment approaches]], often referred to as the "three legged stool",&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration, "Origins of the Three-Legged Stool Metaphor for Social Security," https://www.ssa.gov/history/stool.html, May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to support the quality of personal and family later life. The integration of '''''middle age''''' as an essential dimension of Financial Gerontology reflected Gregg's and Cutler's conceptualization of the "Human Wealth Span" introduced in 1991-1992&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, N.E. and Gregg, D.W., "The Human Wealth Span and Financial Well-Being in Older Age," ''Generations,'' Winter 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, D.W., "The Human Wealth Span: A Life-Span View of Financial Well-Being," Boettner Lecture, Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology, University of Pennsylvania, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As Gregg noted in his 1992 Boettner Lecture, the Human Wealth Span "mirrors" the better known Human Life Span concept which speaks not only to patterns of maturation and aging, but also to identifiable stages in human development.

An especially important additional link in the etiology of the Wealth Span is the emphasis on the '''''Health''''' '''''Span''''' in [[John Rowe (Aetna)|Rowe]] and [[Robert L. Kahn|Kahn]]'s conceptualization of '''[[successful aging]]''', especially the connection between health span stages, health behavior and, thereby, "successful aging." In terms of stages, it is apparent that health behavior choices made earlier affect health status and outcomes later in life. Rowe and Kahn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Successful Aging|last=Rowe, J.W. and Kahn, R.L.|first=|publisher=Random House|year=1998|isbn=0-440-50863-0|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize in this regard, however, that while it is better to start early and always have good health behaviors, even starting such behaviors later life can affect and improve health. For example, both cessation of smoking or "pumping iron" in one's 60s or 70s can have beneficial effects. Drawing on these insights, the wealth span representation of the life span in financial terms emphasizes two stages: the '''accumulation stage''' and the '''expenditure stage''', which are somewhat correlated with developmental-maturational stages. Traditionally, people accumulate wealth in their younger and middle-aged, years, and spend that wealth in their later retirement years. Clearly, as [[Franco Modigliani|Modigliani's]] [[Life-cycle hypothesis|life-cycle saving-spending hypothesis]] illustrates, this is a purposeful simplification of a complex life span dynamic; many people continue to (work and) accumulate in their older years just as, of course, younger and middle-aged persons spend during the accumulation years of their wealth span.

==== Changes in Balance ====
Beyond a concern with the stages of accumulation and expenditure, the wealth span model offers two valuable tools of analysis useful for both academic research and financial practice: (1) changes in the balance between the accumulation stage and the expenditure stage, and (2) increases in the complexity of each of the two stages.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, N.E., ''Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning,'' Wiley 2002, chapters 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; '''B''alance''''' here refers to the number of years in each of the two stages. The usual assumption for financial planning and financial well-being in later life is that the accumulation years provide the wealth for the expenditure years. Basically (but more complex in real life) the event or act of retirement is the behavioral fulcrum that conceptually divides an individual's wealth span into the accumulation years vs. the expenditure years. Compared to the first decades of the twentieth century when many men and women dropped out of high school or earlier to work, since the 1950s most Americans stay in school (high school, college, graduate school) longer than before, thereby reducing the number of years in accumulation stage. Similarly, the number of accumulation years is reduced due to early retirement. As the history of work and retirement during the past seventy years demonstrates, patterns of retirement in the U.S. have shifted, with the strong preferences for early retirement seen during the second half of the 20th century now easing as increasing numbers of older workers (older boomers) remain in or return to the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;Employee Benefit Research Institute,"Work-Force Participation Remains Strong Among Older Workers, Driven by Women," ''News from EBRI'', April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By itself a shorter accumulation stage tells only part of the story. At the same time, across the twentieth century life expectancy has increased substantially resulting in a longer expenditure stage. From the perspective of Financial Gerontology such a shift means that people have fewer years to accumulate and what has been accumulated must last for a longer number of expenditure years. Of course, the fulcrum between the two stages (i.e., the act of retirement) can and has been changing as, in recent years, fewer middle-age and older workers are opting for early retirement. Thus, while it is unlikely that older-age life expectancy will dramatically decline to shorten the expenditure stage, social policy and individual choice do influence the number of years in both the accumulation and expenditure stages. The wealth span model simply provides context, identifies the components, and directs attention to the dynamic interaction between and among them.

====Changes in Complexity====

During the same decades in which the balance between the number of years in the two stages has been changing, the '''''complexity''''' within both the accumulation stage and the expenditure stage also has been increasing. In particular, the well-documented improvements in life expectancy in the United States--including older-age life expectancy as well as life expectancy at birth--has increased the complexity of the wealth span, both accumulation opportunities and expenditure responsibilities, in at least three substantial ways: health care and health care finance, pensions and retirement finance, and family-financial behaviors. First, the more direct impact of greater longevity on finance focuses on health—including both investing in personal health behaviors that anticipate old-age [[Elderly care|health issues]], and [[Medicare (United States)|the financing of health care in later life]]. In the U.S. this includes an accumulation stage planning focus on insurance, involving private [[Health insurance in the United States|health care insurance]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and the emergence of [[long-term care]] and [[long-term care insurance]]. With rising societal and individual health care costs, both the accumulation stage and expenditure stage of the wealth span have become more complex.

A second cluster of expanded wealth span complexities centers on the substantial changes in the U.S. pension or "retirement income" system. In addition to the national Social Security system which provides some basic retirement income for almost all workers, almost half (46%) of all private sector workers also have an employer-sponsored pension. The increasing wealth span complexity, however, is found in the dramatic change in the [[Pensions in the United States|kind of pensions]] held by American workers: [[Defined benefit pension plan|Defined Benefit]] (DB plans) vs. [[Defined contribution plan|Defined Contribution]] (DC plans) pension plans. While the discussion of these types of pensions is discussed in detail elsewhere, it is the fundamental difference in what is "defined"—that is, what is "guaranteed" to the worker in the expenditure stage—that produces the substantial increases in complexity. Conceptually, DB plans define, or largely guarantee, the number of dollars the worker will receive after retirement. It is the employer, primarily, who is responsible for contributing the necessary funds into the plan (sometimes but not always with contributions from the employee). In other words, it is the "output" of pension money that is defined or guaranteed. By contrast, in DC plans, it is only the "input" of contributions into the pension plan that is defined or guaranteed in advance. In many DC plans the employee contributes a specified amount (or percentage) to his/her pension account and the employer matches the amount (in some cases only the employee or only the employer make the contributions). In all these cases, however, the later-life "output" of money to the retiree is based on how well, how successful, the contributed funds have been invested. The magnitude of changes in wealth span complexity precipitated by the shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution plans is illustrated by the clarity of the shift from 1979 to 2013, documented by the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and reported by the Employee Benefit Research Institute:&lt;ref&gt;Employee Benefit Research Institute, FAQs About Benefits--Retirement Issues. https://www.ebri.org/publications/benfaq/index.cfm?fa=retfaq14&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979 28% of private sector workers had a DB pension and only 7% had a DC pension (and 10% had both); by 2013, only 2% had a DB pension and 33% had a DC pension (and 11% had both).

Third, a separate but intertwined expenditure issue focuses on family aging—the degree to which longevity has changed the '''age structure of the family''' with substantial implications for the financial relationships between and among family members. When we say that "people are living longer" we are also saying that parents are living longer. The 1980s concept of the '''[[sandwich generation]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brody|first=E. M.|year=1981|title=Women in the Middle and Family Help to Older People|url=|journal=Gerontologist|volume=October 1981|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on forty-year-olds (usually women) simultaneously taking care of their sixty-five-year old parents and their babies and toddlers. Greater longevity is accompanied by the emergence, however, of the '''''senior'' ''sandwich'' generation''' in which sixty-year-olds are now the family generation in the middle taking care of (socially and financially) their ninety-year old parents alongside caring for their teenage and young-adult children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wassel|first=J.I.|year=2006|title=Financial Planning and the Senior Sandwich Generation|url=|journal=Journal of Financial Service Professionals|volume=60|pages=22–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wassel , J.I. and Cutler, N.E.|first=|year=2016|title=Yet Another Boomer Challenge for Financial Professionals: The 'Senior' Sandwich Generation|url=|journal=Journal of Financial Service Professionals|volume=70|pages=61–73|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These demographically and financiallynew "senior sandwich" responsibilities of middle-agers can have substantial impact on their expenditure stage years, as they are now caring for elderly parents just as they are planning for and entering their own later life. Simultaneously, anticipation of these responsibilities can also add complexity to their accumulation stage planning. While the wealth span model is primarily an individual-level construct, financing health care and middle-age care for elderly parents are substantial issues of macro financial-social policy as well as of individual behavior.

Over the past century substantial changes in complexity have affected both the accumulation and expenditure stages of the wealth span. The increased complexity of the expenditure stage is dramatically evidenced by the fundamental demographic facts of increasing life expectancy which, at base, means spending over a longer number of years. Clearly the largest set of complexities precipitated by greater longevity are seen in older age health, cultural and scientific responses to health and aging, and of course the personal and societal financing of health care—including [[Health insurance in the United States|health care insurance]]. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in particular, and the emergence of [[long-term care]], illustrate the macro [[Health care finance in the United States|financial]] and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|political]] dimensions of the individual consequences of an evolving wealth span. Further exacerbating this complexity, senior sandwich generation responsibilities extend the personal financial impact of older-age longevity to the middle-age children of elderly parents. For example, In 1900 only 39 percent of persons age 50 had one surviving parent, rising to 80 percent by 2000. Further, in 1900 only 7 percent of 60-year olds had even one parent alive, rising to 49 percent by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhlenberg, P.I.|first=|year=1996|title=Mortality Decline in the Twentieth Century and Supply of Kin Over the Life Course|url=|journal=Gerontologist|volume=36|pages=681–685|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Endowed Chairs in Financial Gerontology ===
Joseph E. Boettner, the successful high school educated insurance executive, directed a substantial portion of his wealth to higher education. His earlier gifts reflected his close involvement with the administration and finance of life insurance, especially as a central element in estate planning. With his support, in 1966 Temple University established The Joseph E. Boettner Chair of Risk Management and Insurance. The endowment currently supports not only a distinguished professorship but also scholarships for students seeking the MBA degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fox.temple.edu/research/endowed-professorships/|title=Fox Research Endowed Professorships|last=Temple University|first=Fox School of Business|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the decades during which he worked with his colleague and great friend Dr. Davis Gregg (he called Gregg his "little brother") Boettner came to publicly recognize the importance of creating stronger linkages among life insurance, financial planning, and the science of gerontology. Together Boettner and Gregg also acknowledged that the emerging field of Financial Gerontology would develop best through both a research agenda (i.e., the Boettner Institute) and university programs that support both academic and professional education.

Since 1975 Boettner had been a Trustee of [[Widener University]] in Chester, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. In addition to academic programs he supported development of the campus including a gift that produced Boettner Hall, an undergraduate apartment residence. It was agreed that the new Boettner Chair would be located at Widener. On October 29, 1993, Boettner's "little brother" (fifteen years his junior) passed away. Respecting Boettner's wishes the new Widener Chair was named the Boettner-Gregg Chair in Financial Gerontology. Also with Widener's support, in 1994 Dr. Neal Cutler, who had been Director of the Boettner Center at Penn, was named as the first holder of the Boettner-Gregg Chair. Joseph Boettner died on October 27, 1994.

The Chair at Widener continues as part of the School of Business Administration, currently known as the Boettner Endowed Professor in Financial Planning, held by Kenn B. Tacchino, a professor of taxation and financial planning. Since 1992 the Boettner Center of Financial Gerontology has been part of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to the Center the Boettner resources now support a Wharton professorship, first known as the Joseph E. and Ruth E. Boettner Professor of Financial Gerontology, and held by Dr. Beth J. Soldo, a demographer and sociologist who was also Director of the Boettner Center. It is currently known as the Boettner Professorship, held by Dr. Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics in the Wharton School Department of Business Economics and Public Policy.

===The Emerging Literature of Financial Gerontology===
One hallmark of the institutionalization of a new academic field or subfield is the development of "its own" literature. To be sure, there are countless publications in the academic disciplines of finance and gerontology that refer to money and aging. The four kinds of aging noted earlier—population aging, individual aging, family aging, and generational aging—each identify multiple linkages among aging processes, older men and women, money, and finance that are the focus of academic publications in their respective disciplines. The new field of Financial Gerontology emphasizes closer connections among the scholars, professionals, and writings of the separate fields. The intent, as well as the integration, travels in both directions: to expand the understanding of gerontology among financial professionals and to further illustrate the complexities of finance to gerontologists. This integration is well illustrated by an emerging literature of Financial Gerontology that has been developing over the last twenty-five years, including articles, books, and special issues of academic journals.

The 1992 volume, ''Aging, Money, and Life Satisfaction: Aspects of Financial Gerontology,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aging, Money, and Life Satisfaction: Aspects of Financial Gerontology|last=Cutler, N.E., Gregg, D.W., and Lawton, M.P.|first=|publisher=Springer Publishing|year=1992|isbn=0-8261-7700-X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a first publication of the Boettner Institute, includes an overview of new field plus the first series of annual Boettner Lectures (detailed above in the "Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology" section). Of special note is the '''wealth span''' model discussed in Davis Gregg's demonstration of how the concepts of life span and health span lead directly to an understanding of financial well-being in later life. The wealth span concept is drawn from Nobel prize-winning economist [[Franco Modigliani|Franco Modigliani's]] [[Life-cycle hypothesis|life cycle saving-spending hypothesis]] and became a continuing aspect of the Boettner Institute's research and teaching, as noted earlier.

A major contribution to the development of the literature of Financial Gerontology was the publication in 1996 of the ''Encyclopedia of Financial Gerontology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Financial Gerontology|last=Vitt, L.A. and Siegenthaler, J.K.|first=|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|isbn=0-313-28549-7|location=Westport, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Dr. Lois Vitt and Dr. Jurg Siegenthaler. The one-volume publication includes over 150 authors each providing a two- to five-page article on a subject relevant to one of eight core topics: Economic and Income Security; Employment, Work, and Retirement; Family and Intergenerational Issues; Financial Advice, Investments, and Consumer Services; Health Care and Health Insurance; Housing and Housing Finance; Legal Issues and Services; Quality of Life and Well-Being. As an [[encyclopedia]], the organization is of course alphabetical, ranging literally from Accelerated Death Benefits to Zoning. To enhance pedagogical value to educators, however, each of the 150+ articles is listed under one of the eight core topics at the front of the volume. To enhance value to researchers, each article includes a short bibliography plus a number of "see also" references to other articles in the collection. Finally, given the broad multidisciplinary nature of the developing field of Financial Gerontology, including the non-standardization of several disciplinary vocabularies, the encyclopedia includes a massively detailed 40-page index in which such subjects as "assets," "consumer protection," or "employment" are included in multiple articles.

In 2003, an expanded edition of the encyclopedia was published under the title ''Encyclopedia of Retirement and Finance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Retirement and Finance|last=Vitt, L.A.|first=|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32495-6|location=Westport, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Dr. Lois Vitt. The number of authors, articles, and core topics were all increased, resulting in a substantial two-volume encyclopedia. While a core purpose continued to be as a resource for researchers and teachers, the new edition signals the growth of Financial Gerontology as a component of professional education. [See "Financial Gerontology as Professional Education" below.] As Dr. Vitt writes in the Preface: "My experience in consumer financial education during the past several years led to this revised edition, which has been expanded to include many additional topics about preretirement and retirement issues. Included in the new edition are entries that span the array of employer sponsored health and retirement benefits, which are increasingly central to working Americans and to their partners and family members. There is a great need for this financial knowledge to reach the many professionals who advise, support, sell products to, serve, assist, and teach mid-life and later-life clients."

In 2002 the J.K. LasserPro division of Wiley published the first textbook in Financial Gerontology, under the title ''Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning.|last=Cutler, N.E.|first=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-471-41470-0|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book builds on two of the key Financial Gerontology concepts mentioned earlier: (1) the wealth span, including its accumulation stage and expenditure stage, and (2) the four "lenses" or kinds of aging: individual aging, population aging, family aging, and generational aging. The wealth span concept builds on Rowe and Kahn's ideas of "health span" and successful aging. As Cutler notes, just as good health habits can start at any time but should start early in life, so too can good financial habits start any time but better begun early. Following a detailed review of the different "kinds" of aging the book focuses directly on the how changes in the stages of the wealth span affect individual financial attitudes and behavior. Chapter 5 focuses on the changing "balance" in years between the accumulation stage (fewer years due to personal preferences and public policies) favoring early retirement, and the expenditure stage (more years due to increasing longevity). Of perhaps greater significance (Chapter 6) are three interrelated dimensions of increasing complexity of the accumulation stage: (1) the trend toward multiple sources of later-life income which an individual or family is likely to have (e.g., an individual retirement account, an employer-based pension, Social Security, personal investments and savings, home equity); (2) the dramatic move from Defined Benefit pensions ("'''''they are responsible''''' for my future retirement income") to Defined Contribution pensions ("'''''I am''''' '''''responsible''''' for my future retirement income"); (3) increasing family-connected financial complexities (nowadays a 62-year-old is more likely than in prior decades to have one or more surviving 87-year-old parents).

The textbook also includes chapters on the multiple meanings of "middle" when talking about the financial psychology of middle age, as well as chapters on health insurance, long-term care, and reverse mortgages. Not surprisingly, much of the data and some of the issues surrounding, for example, Medicare (e.g., there was no Medicare Part D in 2002), Medicaid, long-term care insurance, and nursing home cost data, are out of date. Conversely, the key concepts surrounding the wealth span model (such as changes in the accumulation stage and the expenditure stage) remain relevant as the demographic, personal, and policy context of finance and aging becomes more complex. In this regard, speaking as much to undergraduates as to financial professionals, Chapter 1 identifies four Principles of Financial Gerontology that are relatively independent of the "current" state of aging and finance: (1) Gerontology is not the study of old people.  (2) Financial decisions are family decisions.  (3) Wealth Span interventions are better when made earlier but can work at any age.  (4) The Wealth Span adviser, as a trusted family adviser, will be called upon to--and should be educationally equipped to--provide non-financial guidance. (p.&amp;nbsp;6).

In addition to the development of text and handbooks, the broader academic and interdisciplinary recognition of a new field or subfield is evidenced also by the publication of special topical issues of major disciplinary journals. The American Society on Aging [ASA]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=www.asaging.org/about-asa|last=American Society on Aging|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the two major multidisciplinary membership organizations in the United States focusing on issues of aging. [The older, slightly larger organization is the [[Gerontological Society of America]], founded in 1945, which has separate divisions for biological-medical science, behavioral sciences, and social practice.] Founded in 1954, the ASA's membership of 5,000 professionals includes educators and researchers alongside service providers, program administrators, business executives, policy makers, and students. Each issue of the ASA's widely-read journal, ''Generations,'' typically focuses on a single research or policy issue, offering a dozen or more articles plus bibliographical resources. The Summer 1997 issue of ''Generations'' (volume XXI, no. 2) was titled "Financial Dimensions of Aging." The twelve articles introduced the relatively new field of Financial Gerontology to a new audience of professionals. Subjects included the history of retirement security, economic diversity, boomers as young middle-agers compared to their parents at the same age (in 1997 boomers were only 33 to 51 years old), financial literacy, and an assessment of the Social Security crisis of the day.

The Winter 2004-05 issue of ''Generations'' (volume XXVII, no. 4), titled "Silver Industries," provided a more focused business and aging view of Financial Gerontology. Here the emphasis was on how specific industries and products are being developed in response to aging individuals and aging society. Introductory articles included a brief history of the evolving link between business and aging, generational differences in the psychology of the older consumer, and the marketing challenges in reaching older consumers. Most of the seventeen articles, however, focused on the relationship of aging to specific industries, including: the pharmaceutical industry, financial services, automobiles, moving services, venture capital, and the ''[[personal digital assistant]]'' (forerunner of today's smartphones). The Silver Industries construct continues to be an important dimension of Financial Gerontology, including for example,''The Silver Market Phenomenon: Marketing and Innovation in the Aging Society''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silver Market Phenomenon: Marketing and Innovation in the Aging Society|last=Kohlbacher, F. and Herstatt, C. (eds.)|first=|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial Gerontology as Professional Education ==

===The Bimonthly Financial Gerontology Column===
The ''Journal of Financial Service Professionals,'' established in 1946, published bimonthly, is the official journal of the Society of Financial Service Professionals. The Society, established in 1927, was the de facto alumni association of the American College of Life Underwriters (known currently as [[The American College of Financial Services]]) whose primary insurance education designations are the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) and more recently the Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC). Hence, the original name of the journal was the ''Journal of the American Society of CLU and ChFC.'' In addition to longer articles submitted on a range of financial, legal, and administrative topics, each issue of the journal includes several continuing "Departments." These bimonthly research and professional practice reviews and tutorials include such continuing topics as Accounting &amp; Taxation, Social Security Planning, Ethics, Practice Management, Estate Planning, Technology, Health Insurance, Risk Management, and Advice for the New Planner. In the November 1990 issue of the ''Journal of the American Society of CLU and ChFC,'' President-Emeritus of the American College of Life Underwriters, Davis W. Gregg, Ph.D, introduced a new continuing column ("Department") titled "Financial Gerontology" with his essay on the Human Wealth Span.

The first "permanent" author of the column was Dr. Neal E. Cutler, the recently installed Director of the Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology (described earlier). His first column was also published in the November 1990 issue of the journal, alongside Dr. Gregg's introduction. Dr. Cutler authored the column for a quarter-century (bimonthly through 1997 and every other bimonthly column through March 2016). During these years, guest authors and co-authors included Dr. Harry R. ("Rick") Moody, Director of Academic Affairs at the AARP; Dr. Janice I. Wassel, Director of The Gerontology Program at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; Dr. Robert C. Atchley, Director of the Scripps Gerontology Center at the Miami University of Ohio; and Dr. Steven J. Devlin, a former vice-provost at Lehigh University.

The second permanent author of the Financial Gerontology column, sharing the bimonthly writing with Dr. Cutler beginning in 1997, was and is Dr. Sandra Timmermann. Dr. Timmermann is a gerontologist who focuses on educational outreach especially in the areas of business, care-giving, long-term care, and adult housing. A recipient of the American Society on Aging's Cavanagh Award for Excellence in Education and Training, Dr. Timmermann was Executive Director of the MetLife Mature Market Institute from 1997 to 2013. She is currently Adjunct Professor of Gerontology at the American College of Financial Services. Following Dr. Cutler's "retirement" from the column, Dr. John N. Migliaccio was selected by the Journal as the third permanent author of "Financial Gerontology" sharing the bimonthly schedule with Dr. Timmermann. Dr. Migliaccio is President of Maturing Mark Services company, a planning and research consultancy working with financial and social services companies and agencies. He is adjunct faculty in the DePaul University Asset-Based Community Development Institute, was one of the founders of the American Institute of Financial Gerontology, and previously was Director of Research at the MetLife Mature Market Institute. 

'''Multiple Columns, Multiple Topics'''

The orientation of the "gerontology column" in the Journal of Financial Service Professionals mirrors the basic mission of Financial Gerontology itself: to introduce, teach, illustrate, document, and explain the concepts, issues, data, and experiences of gerontology to professionals in the fields of finance and business. Since 1990, the range of topics and titles collectively reflects what could be seen as a full introductory university course in gerontology offered to the financial services professional (albeit without formal exams and credits). Some of the columns have been "data heavy," including: “The Older Population and Rising National Health Care Costs: A Case of the ‘Compositional Fallacy’?” (January 1993); “Pension Complexity, the Middle Class, and Financial Professionals: New Evidence from the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances" (November 2003); “Generational Demographics, Gerontology, and Finance: Size Matters, but the Story is More Complex” (July 2009); “How Everybody’s Consumer Opinions Interact with the Gross Domestic Product: A Brief Look at the Index of Consumer Sentiment” (July 2013); “The Twenty-first Century ‘Dependency Ratio’—Older People vs. Older Workers” (November 2013); “The Democratization of Financial Gerontology" (March 2014).

One of the foundational concepts of Financial Gerontology is that gerontology is not the study of "old people" but is the study of the multiple processes of aging. A corollary (and conundrum) of this concept is that age differences among individuals and groups of people may not be the result of aging. An alternative explanation, a "rival hypothesis" to maturational-developmental aging, is the ''generational explanation''. In many areas of human attitudes and behavior--financial, social, political, personal--the differences between younger and older people may be caused not by their aging but by their generation, their [[Cohort effect|birth cohort]], their personal exposure to a slice of history when they were growing up. Given the direct relevance to financial practitioners of untangling the maturation (aging) vs. generation (cohort) interpretations of financial behavior, a number of Financial Gerontology columns over the years focused on this generational cluster of issues, including: “Communicating With Worried Older Clients: The Impact of ‘Generational Diversity’ ” (May 1992); “Too Much Money for Retirement: Are There Generational Differences?” (November 2005); “Financial Planning for the ‘Senior Sandwich’ Generation,” (March 2006); “Current Trends in Pension Participation: The Impact of Age, Cohort, and Enrollment Practices” (July 2006); “Prospective Age vs. Chronological Age: Why 60 Really is the New 40” (March 2010).

Other columns focus more directly on the family and care-giving issues that financial professionals encounter when dealing with "older" men and women (including middle-aged persons); for example: “Personal Care, Home Care, and Long-Term Care Insurance" (November 1991); “Caring For Elderly Parents: Where Do You Look For Help? [Why Does a Financial Planner Need to Know About Geriatric Care?]” (July 1994); “The Financial Services Advisor as a Geriatric Medical Consultant" (July 2002); “Live Long and Prosper: The Challenges of Longevity Planning" (November 2008); "Life Planning and Retirement Planning: Where Do They Intersect?" (January 2016); "Planning for the Utterly Unexpected: Advice for the Financial Planner" (November 2017).

Not surprisingly, the main focus of Financial Gerontology columns is on connections among aging and money. Even as the services being sold are primarily financial, in dealing with aging men and women alongside their middle-aging family, the financial professional is often asked for non-financial advice. Questions about long-term care, senior housing, estate and longevity planning often requires expertise beyond just financial choices and specifics. Sometimes the questions are quasi-emergencies, about a parent's possible memory issues, driving, where and when to move out of a large house. The experience of many financial professionals is that understanding such non-financial issues, having a supply of information and referral, helps to build a relationship of empathy, trust, and expertise. Several of the columns illustrate how the financial professional can at times act as a kind of geriatric consultant to their clients, including: “Alzheimer's Disease as 'Normal Aging'-- Retirement Planning and the New Longevity” (November 1993); Caring For Elderly Parents: Where Do You Look For Help? [Why Does a Financial Planner Need to Know About Geriatric Care?]” (July 1994); “Geriatric Assisted Living: When Mom and Dad Can’t Live Alone Anymore” (March 1996); “The Financial Services Advisor as a Geriatric Medical Consultant" (July 2002); “The Financial Professional’s Role in Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment” (March 2005).

And where every Financial Gerontology column embodies a serious educational purpose, several have had a more whimsical flavor, including: “Sex, Asset Accumulation, and Rock’n’Roll: Introducing Retirement Planning to Teenagers and Other Pre-Middle-Agers" (November 1992); “Hair Spray and Life Insurance: Capitalizing on the Baby Boom's Diversity" (May 1993); “Successful Aging, Willard Scott, and Dental Floss" (March 2002); “Nanatechnology: The Financial Gerontologist as Technology Consultant” (July 2008); “Nostalgia as a Financial Variable” (March 2011); "Tombstones" (July 2015); "Millennials and Finance: The Amazon Generation" (November 2015).

===The American Institute of Financial Gerontology===
The idea for a formal educational program in Financial Gerontology emerged starting around 1999 from the experience of two gerontology researchers-teachers, Dr. Neal Cutler and Dr. John Migliaccio. At the time Cutler was a professor of gerontology and Migliaccio was president of a gerontology marketing and consulting firm. The work of each focused on a financial view of gerontology and a gerontological view of finance. Over the years they had been invited to give presentations (sometimes together, sometimes individually) on gerontology to meetings and organizations of financial professionals. The increasing number of these invited presentations suggested to them the need within the financial services profession for a more structured and recurring educational program. As noted in the discussion of the Boettner Institute, the basic model was not to teach finance but to introduce, explain, illustrate, the value of gerontology to professionals already providing financial services to clients. This general educational goal was strengthened by the fact that the clientele of an increasing number of financial professionals included not only younger clients who were now elders, but also the middle-aged families of those now-elder clients.

Working with a small number of colleagues in both the financial services industry and academic gerontology, they drafted a curriculum of core courses and electives, examined alternative educational formats, identified potential faculty, and evaluated the likely success of a new educational program in a financial industry already populated with dozens of courses, certificates, and continuing education alternatives. The view of each of these elements was judged to be positive, and the American Institute of Financial Gerontology (AIFG) was incorporated in 2002. The educational structure of AIFG follows the general model of professional education. It offers a range of specialized courses, including both required and elective courses followed by a monitored written examination, culminating in a named designation. AIFG chose a "traditional" educational model of in-person courses and examinations; the explosion of online education was just beginning. Each course was a four-hour lecture-discussion seminar. Completion of the program included four required Core courses and two Electives (described below) selected from an expanding list of elective topics and courses. Like the traditional courses, the comprehensive final examination was also done in-person in a monitored context. AIFG's designation was conferred upon successful completion of the six courses and exam. Given the number of certifications in the finance industry, the initial name of the designation was "Certified Financial Gerontologist" (CFG). In addition to other reasons for this name, the rationale was also that financial professionals would see the parallel between the CFG and the well-established [[Certified Financial Planner|Certified Financial Planner (CFG)]] designation. Financial Gerontology would be seen as an additional specialization that some professionals would add to their education and training. As it turned out, however, the parallelism of CFG and CFP was perceived by some as more confusing that helpful. Consequently, after two years of courses and awarded designations, as the newer and smaller program AIFG changed its designation to the Registered Financial Gerontologist (RFG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uzelac|first=Ellen|date=February 2006|title=Wisdom for the Ages|url=|journal=Research|volume=Volume 29, Number 2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Congemi|first=Frank|date=September 2008|title=Plan Your Future with Financial Gerontology|url=http://www.mdmag.com/journals/pmd/2006/110/4776|journal=MD Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Students and Prerequisites====
The RFG vs. CFP relationship is important to the AIFG story in another fundamental way: identifying students eligible to enroll in the program. A basic premise of Financial Gerontology education is that it teaches gerontology to financial professionals. Thus, from its earliest conception AIFG required a demonstrable financial educational background as the prerequisite to enrollment in the RFG program. During the first five years of the program, most RFG students were those who had previously earned the CFP -- or similar financial planning certifications (e.g., the ChFC, Chartered Financial Consultant). In this structured way the AIFG curriculum was not intended to compete with other basic financial educational programs, but to be an extended, specialized educational experience. Some of the AIFG students described it as a "boutique" kind of focused education. In recent years, as the program grew nationally, about a third of AIFG students came from other finance-related occupations, including lawyers, accountants, stock brokers, retirement advisers, social services administrators, and even some financial journalists. While not required, virtually all AIFG students had a college degree although not necessarily in finance, economics, or business. Rather, the key enrollment prerequisite was professional practitioner experience in financial services.

====AIFG Core Courses and Electives====
'''Core Courses.''' AIFG courses, both Core and Electives, are "traditional" in-class face-to-face seminar classes (typically 20-25 students). Each course is scheduled as a four-hour class. Each student takes the four Core courses plus two Electives. To minimize the amount of travel and time that full-time financial professionals would spend out of office, the curriculum was offered and organized into a mid-to-late-week schedule: two four-hour Core courses on a Wednesday, the second two Core courses on Thursday, two Electives (selected from four available at any given session) on Friday, and the comprehensive examination on Saturday morning.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 101.''' The introductory course, "The New Science of Wealth Span Planning", introduces the Wealth Span model of individual-level financial planning, with a focus on the four "kinds" or four "lenses" of aging described earlier: population aging, individual aging, family aging, and generational aging. In introducing the Wealth Span model, the course focuses on the historical changes from the 19th to the 21st Century in the balance between and the changes within the Accumulation Stage and Expenditure Stage of the Wealth Span. AIFG 101 also introduces the student to different ways of understanding national (and international) population dynamics that demonstrate the gerontological demographics influencing individuals, families, social policies, and their combined impact on financial issues. For example, [[Population pyramid|population pyramids]] are used to illustrate changes, 1950 to 2050, in the fundamental age structure of the United States, the contours of which illustrate the "morphing" of a triangular profile into an oval population profile.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 102.''' The second Core course, "Basic Processes of Aging: Physical, Psychological, and Social", builds on the core concept that gerontology is not the study of "old people" but embodies a central focus on the '''multiple''' processes of aging. Students see the progression of aging and maturation from the perspectives of biology, psychology, and sociology. The course examines also how the maturational stages of the life course affect overall life planning which in turn directly influence how individual and family financial decisions are made in the crucial areas of employment and retirement. In keeping with the multidisciplinary nature of gerontology in general, this course is regularly taught by a professor of sociology who directs a university gerontology program and who is also a faculty member in a medical school.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 103.''' The third Core course, "Serving the Older Client: Values, Ethics, and Lifespan Development" , moves into the realm of ethics and legal aspects of client-oriented financial practice. Part of the course elaborates the procedural nuts and bolts of serving and protecting the interests of older persons, e.g., guardianships, conservatorships, powers of attorney, trusts. More critically, the course focuses on the ethical (which can become legal) challenges in the context of older clients, e.g., client decisional capacity and surrogate decision-making. In many cases the key question becomes "who is the client?" For example, when the son (and heir) brings his 80-year-old father to the son's financial planner in order to "review" the father's pattern of investing and spending, who really is the professional's client? In this way the course introduces some of the ideas offered in the Family Aging Elective (AIFG 105). The course was initially developed by a professor of ethics and philosophy and later taught by attorneys one of whom is a past president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 104.''' The fourth Core course, "Financing Longevity" , returns to the linkages between gerontology and finance. While much financial practice focuses on how individuals establish and accumulate their financial resources, a primary interest of most older clients is protecting and spending their wealth with an eye to their own and their family's future needs. In the 21st Century, further, financial practice is taking place as men and women are spending more time in their older years. Part of the course introduces the basics of pensions, Social Security, and Medicare as key elements of financial resources in older age; in this way, the course also introduces the AIFG Long-term Care (AIFG 107) and Medicare (AIFG 110) electives. A critical component of the course, however, is taking a dynamic look at how different forms of investment, risk, and expenditures change over the life course, over the wealth span. How should Tom and Mary's financial plan at age 55 be different from their plan at age 35 (and when their children are toddlers vs. their now 30-year-old "kids")? This course has been taught only by faculty who have (at least) the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation.

'''Electives.''' In addition to these four Core courses each student is required to complete two Electives (also offered as four-hour in-person seminar style classes). Over the years, six Electives were rotated through the curriculum.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 105.''' '''Family Aging'''. The central premise of the "families and money" Elective, "Families and Aging: Resources for Professionals" is that "financial decisions are family decisions." As the population ages so do individual members of the family. As with other elements of gerontology, this implies that it is not just the parents (and grandparents) who are older than was the case in prior decades.  In the context of Family Aging the care-providing children are also older than was the case decades ago. These family aging dynamics have produced an extension of the concept of the "sandwich" generation into the more contemporary reality of the "senior sandwich" generation in which the "60-year-old kids" are the generation in the middle, taking care of (financially and personally) their 90-year-old parents (while also providing financial assistance to their own adult children. AIFG 105 is offered at every AIFG session; it has become "almost" a Core course in that the vast majority of students elect to take it.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 106.''' '''Aging Network.''' The "Aging Network and the Long-Term Care Service Delivery System" Elective focuses on two care-provider aging-oriented networks within which professionals should work in providing financial counseling and services to their clients. The "formal" network of over local 600 Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) are part of the local-state-federal network created since the 1970s by the [[Older Americans Act]] of 1965 (OAA). Much of the work of the AAAs is aimed at identifying services and local agencies that will increase the capacity to elderly and frail persons to age in place in their own home, rather than moving into nursing homes -- which clearly has financial as well as social consequences for elders and their family. Since relatively few financial professionals are aware of this aging network and the various social, nutrition, and health services the local AAAs provide, AIFG 105 was developed to provide the connection. In addition to this formal network, AIFG also introduces the larger network of organizations, agencies, and programs with which the financial professional can partner to offer clients a variety of assistance.  This Elective is offered in about half of AIFG sessions.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 107. Long-term Care Solutions.'''  Long-term care institutions and services, with an emphasis on the complexity of financing and especially long-term care insurance, has been a high priority concern of financial planners and their clients. "Long-term Care Solutions" offers a comprehensive overview of the subject. While a substantial part of long-term care financing is seen in individually-purchased long-term care insurance, a substantial proportion of older Americans believe they will pay for their long-term care, either services or nursing home residence, from Medicare. While Medicare's primary function is health insurance, under some circumstances it does pay for some long-term services. Further, Medicaid does pay for nursing home services under some circumstances. Both of these "under some circumstances" make the financial planning for long-term complex, for both client and the adviser, including the "complexity" of misunderstanding of "Medicare" vs. "Medicaid" vs. "medigap" by both professionals and the public. AIFG 107 is a very popular Elective and is offered at almost every AIFG session.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 108. Financial Preparedness.''' The overarching theme of the  "Financial Preparedness for Later Life" Elective is that while most financial planners have substantial knowledge of and experience with strategies for investment and wealth accumulation (especially in dealing with relatively younger clients), traditional understanding of the tools and techniques of later-life spending, risk, and family dynamics. Dealing with the already-made "fixed" results of previously-made choices concerning pensions, investments, and Social Security is only a first step. In discussing individual and family strategies for expanding wealth in later life as well as protecting the already accumulated assets, AIFG 108 examines such approaches as portfolio theory and probability theory, including techniques for managing several kinds of financial risk in the context of multiple and tiered time horizons especially relevant to older persons and their families, alongside the effects of inflation and taxes. 

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 109. Marketing.''' "Successful Marketing to the 50+ Population" is designed to serve the majority of AIFG students who are sole proprietors or partners in small businesses and thus are responsible for their own local marketing strategies. The course reviews marketing approaches of special relevance to older persons, including consumer values analysis, strategies for mature consumer segmentation, and current psychographic frameworks. Seen through the "lens" of Generational Aging, the course places special emphasis on the consumer characteristics of the major generational cohorts that define the 50+ age population, including Baby Boomers, "In-Betweeners," and Seniors. Further, looking through the "lens" of Family Aging, the course examines such strategies as "tangential marketing" through which, for example, marketing is aimed at middle-age-children purchasers for products to be "consumed" by their elder parents. This Elective is offered at almost every AIFG session. 

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 110. Medicare.''' One of the key links among aging, money, and retirement is concern with how to pay for health care. AIFG courses speak to this central Financial Gerontology issue in several ways, including:  trends in Population Aging and Individual Aging (AIFG 101), physical and psychological aspects of aging (AIFG 102), allocation of resources across the life course (AIFG 104), middle-aged children's responsibilities for elder parents (AIFG 105), and the financing of long-term care (AIFG 107). Substantial Medicare changes were enacted in 2003 in the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Modernization Act]], especially its central policy and financial innovation, the [[Medicare Part D|Part D prescription drug benefit]] to subsidize the costs of prescription drugs and prescription drug insurance premiums for Medicare beneficiaries. In response to requests and advice from both prior and potential students, in collaboration with a health care attorney specializing in public programs, in 2006 AIFG created and offered AIFG 110, "Gerontology and the New Medicare." The course includes a detailed history of Medicare, including distinctions between Medicare and [[Medicaid]]; a review and analysis of Medicare Supplemental Insurance plans (usually referred to as "[[medigap]]" insurance) including standardization of plans, State variations, and the role of [[Managed care|Managed Care]]; and, centrally, the processes, scope and limitations, and cost of the new Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits. This Elective is offered at every AIFG session.

====Faculty Profiles====
Reflecting the field of Financial Gerontology itself, the AIFG faculty is highly multidisciplinary, including a range of both academic and professional disciplines. Over the years, twenty-two faculty have taught the AIFG courses described above. The faculty includes elder law attorneys, social workers, financial planners, accountants, insurance specialists, social service administrators, and university faculty. The AIFG faculty exhibits a fairly broad range of degrees and designations, including:  PhD (7), CFP [plus ChFC, etc.] (5); JD (3), MBA (3), MSW (2), MHealth (2), CPA (1). Three of the four Core courses are taught exclusively by PhDs: New Science of Wealth Span Planning, Basic Processes of Aging, and Family Aging. The Ethics and Values course was developed and taught by a professor of ethics and currently taught only by elder law attorneys. The Marketing course has been taught by two faculty each of whom owns their own small aging-focused marketing firms. The Financing Longevity and Financial Preparedness courses were taught by finance specialists with MBA and CFP backgrounds. The Long-term Care Finance and Medicare courses are taught only by faculty with finance, law, or accounting backgrounds.

===International Financial Gerontology===
====Korean Institute of Financial Gerontology====

Of the hundreds of students who completed the AIFG's Registered Financial Gerontologist (RFG) program, one was a Korean banker and entrepreneur studying for his Master of Science degree in Gerontology at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro (UNCG). Dr. Joo Han, a successful Mergers and Acquisitions banker in South Korea who earlier earned his PhD in Accounting from City University of New York, was developing a second career focused on providing housing and social services to elders in Korea. During his MS-Gerontology studies he also enrolled in the AIFG program in 2008 which was offering the RFG curriculum at UNCG. Dr. Han saw the linking social and financial services education as similarly valuable for financial advisers in Korea, using the AIFG program as a model. Despite the obvious cultural and language differences between Korea and the U.S., alongside the somewhat-similar but different demographic and retirement profiles of the two countries, Han resolved to bring Financial Gerontology education and training to Korea. A partnership with AIFG was developed, and in June 2011 the Korean Institute of Financial Gerontology began offering its RFG curriculum.

Both Korea and the United States are experiencing substantial Population Aging, with increasingly large numbers and percentages of their populations living in older age. Both countries have retirement security policies that include both public and private pensions. Beyond such basic similarities, however, are substantial differences that speak directly to the need for advisers and clients who understand the concepts and details of Financial Gerontology. In the realm of population, for example, Korea is aging at a faster pace than the U.S. and is expected to reach the status of "hyper-aged" (e.g., % of the population over age 65; large numbers of centenarians) in 2026 -- compared to the U.S. in 2036. In this sense, given the impact of gerontological demographics upon financial practice, the need for Financial Gerontology education in Korea is substantial. On the matter of health care in older age, for example, although Korean citizens have the advantage of [[Health in South Korea|universal health care]], the need for educated health-financial planning remains. In part this is due to recent patterns of health insurance. The National Health Insurance Act, enacted in 1977, initially focused on workers in large companies, later expanded to other employment sectors, reaching universal coverage by 1989. Further, health insurance itself was provided by hundreds of employment-sector based insurance societies, but merged into a single health care system by 2004.

The retirement income security policies in Korea are similar to the model of a three-legged stool or three-tier system that characterizes the U.S. and other countries. The first tier is the [[Pension policy in South Korea|Basic Livelihood Security Program]] for all Korean citizens in poverty, functionally (if roughly) similar to the [[Supplemental Security Income|U.S. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.]] It is based on current income (welfare) rather than on age or past employment. The first tier also includes the National Basic Livelihood Security program which provides income to retired older persons; this program is based on both age and current income. The second tier is the National Pension Scheme (NPS) created in 1986. The NPS is a government guaranteed employment-based [[Defined benefit pension plan|Defined Benefit]] pension plan, partially funded by the employee and employer who contribute equally (currently, 4.5% of gross income) to the plan. Coverage is fundamentally mandatory for persons employed in both private and public organizations. The third tier reflects individual investment and savings.

Embedded in this birds-eye view of the Korean income security system are several complexities that suggest the need for advisers trained in both finance and gerontology. Perhaps the largest area of complexity is the relative newness of pension policies and systems, especially considering the rapid economic development of the Korean economy in the past two decades alongside, as mentioned, the rapid aging of the Korean population. Created as a Defined Benefit pension system, the NPS includes official income replacement rates. The NPS soon recognized that due to rapid population and related factors, the fund was facing financial deficits. Consequently, first in 1998 and again in 2007, the replacement rates were lowered from 70% to 60% and then to 50%, with another reduction to 40% over the years 2009-2028. During these years, also as part of responding to an anticipated deficit, the full-benefits retirement age was raised from 60 to 65. Both confusion about benefits and distrust in the national pension system increased. An additional complication is that Korean pension benefits are often paid as lump sum annuities, placing even more responsibility on the retiree for balancing financial issues with older-age planning.

The sum of these and similar dynamics influenced Dr. Joo Han to partner with AIFG to establish the Korean Institute of Financial Gerontology (KIFG). The KIFG approach focuses on working with specific financial institutions -- primarily banks, investment firms, and insurance companies -- to provide education and training to their employees, compared to the AIFG focus on individual professionals as students in educational sessions held at academic and gerontology venues throughout the country. During its first years KIFG graduated about 100 students per year.

KIFG offers a five-day curriculum of required courses, reflecting 40 hours of coursework. Each day represents a Financial Gerontology theme. Day 1 is an introduction to Financial Gerontology, including an overview of the aging society, examination of Baby Boomer policies in Korea, and an examination of the [[University of the Third Age|multinational]] "Third Age" concept -- roughly the time between retirement and disability when the older individual can focus on life fulfilling activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gerontology in the Era of the Third Age: Implications and Next Steps|last=Karr, D.  and Komp, K.|first=|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day 2 focuses on housing issues, including universal design and the development of age-friendly cities, older-age housing, long-term care services, and the role of nonprofit organizations in the housing arena. Included here also is the new "well-dying" law in Korea that recognizes the rights of terminally ill people to choose their own death and die with dignity. Day 3 is an experiential day in which the students, mostly financial professionals working in banks and insurance companies, visit senior centers, nursing homes, and other older age facilities. Day 4 focuses on the practicalities linking longevity and financial planning, including elder law, health care, and marketing to the 50+ population. Day 5 introduces concepts and issues of communicating with seniors, counselling psychology with seniors, and what is included in a "senior-friendly" business.

====Financial Gerontology in China====

Following two years of discussion and negotiation, in 2017 a partnership was established between AIFG and a financial services company in the People's Republic of China to establish a Financial Gerontology program in China. Shanghai Jian Rui Investment &amp; Management Ltd. (JR), based in Shanghai, is involved in investment and pension management. As in other developing countries, significant changes in public social security programs and private pension arrangements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pensionfundsonline.co.uk/content/country-profiles/china/105|title=Country Profiles: China|last=Pension Funds Online|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside rapid Population Aging and Individual Aging, have created an emerging need for advisers and managers with knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of Financial Gerontology in [[Economy of China|China]]. To further these educational goals, JR has in turn partnered with the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS), described as the premier and the most comprehensive academic research organization in China for study in the fields of philosophy and social sciences. As initially conceived, the program in China will adapt and build upon the AIFG curriculum of four Core courses and selected Elective courses. The intent of the program is to offer the Registered Financial Gerontologist professional designation to qualified Chinese students. At the same time, individual courses and sets of courses will be made available to students not seeking to achieve a formal certification. Through a set of working groups involving JR, CASS, and AIFG, substantial adaptation is being made to reflect the current financial, demographic, and policy contours of the Chinese aging society. The inaugural Chinese Financial Gerontology courses are scheduled to be offered in the first quarter of 2018.

'''''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule''''' (''Foreign Languages and University'') is a triannual [[academic journal]] published by the [[German Association of University Language Centers]].

==History==
The journal was created in 1968 under the title ''AKS-Rundbrief'' (= AKS-Circular) by the German Association of University Language Centers. Being a practice-oriented journal in the first phase of its existence, it has developed into an academic, at times empirical, journal throughout the years.

==Content and scope==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' covers [[second language acquisition]], [[language education]], and [[applied linguistics]], with [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[German language|German]] as foreign languages being the potential target languages. Intercultural analyses represent an important part as well. Publication languages are German as well as any of the languages mentioned above.

==Publication and editors==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' is published triannually by the German Association of Language Centers, which is a sub-organization of the [[European Association of Language Centers]]. There are three editors, with manuscripts requiring two positive votes.

==Article types==
In addition to academic [[Article (publishing)|articles]], [[book review]]s on relevant publications, including newly published [[textbook]]s, are also included. In addition, the journal publishes [[call for papers|calls for papers]] and [[academic conference]] announcements. The journal also serves as an information and publication platform for [[UNIcert]] - the international education and certification system for foreign languages taught at universities, which was founded in [[Germany]] and whose headquarters are located there.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has two parts: the [[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal4]] gene, encoding the [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] [[transcription activator]] [[protein]] [[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal4]], and the UAS ([[Upstream Activation Sequence]]), an enhancer to which GAL4 specifically binds to activate gene [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]].

== Overview ==
The '''[[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal4]]''' system allows separation of the problems of defining which cells express a gene or protein and what the experimenter wants to do with this knowledge. Geneticists have created genetic varieties of model organisms (typically fruit flies), called ''GAL4 lines'', each of which expresses GAL4 in some subset of the animal's tissues. For example, some lines might express GAL4 only in muscle cells, or only in nerves, or only in the antennae, and so on. For fruit flies in particular, there are tens of thousands of such lines, with the most useful expressing GAL4 in only a very specific subset of the animal—perhaps, for example, only those [[neuron]]s that connect two specific compartments of the fly's brain. The presence of GAL4, by itself, in these cells has little or no effect, since GAL4's main effect is to bind to a UAS region, and most cells have no (or innocuous) UAS regions.

Since [[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal4]] by itself is not visible, and has little effect on cells, the other necessary part of this system are the "reporter lines". These are strains of flies with the special UAS region next to a desired gene. These genetic instructions occur in every cell of the animal, but in most cells nothing happens since that cell is not producing GAL4. In the cells that ''are'' producing GAL4, however, the UAS is activated, the gene next to it is turned on, and it starts producing its resulting protein. This may report to the investigator which cells are expressing GAL4, hence the term "reporter line", but genes intended to manipulate the cell behavior are often used as well.

Typical [[reporter gene]]s include:
* Fluorescent proteins like [[green fluorescent protein|green]] (GFP) or [[red fluorescent protein|red]] fluorescent proteins (RFP), which allow scientists to see which cells express [[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal4]]
* [[Channelrhodopsin]], which allows light-sensitive triggering of nerve cells
* [[Halorhodopsin]], which conversely allows light to suppress the firing of neurons
* Shibire, which shuts neurons off, but only at higher temperatures (30&amp;nbsp;°C and above). Flies with this gene can be raised and tested at lower temperatures where their neurons will behave normally. Then the body temperature of the flies can be raised (since they are [[Ectotherm|cold-blooded]]), and these neurons turn off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Conditional modification of behavior in ''Drosophila'' by targeted expression of a temperature-sensitive shibire allele in defined neurons  |author=Kitamoto, Toshihiro  |journal=Journal of Neurobiology  |volume=47  |issue=2  |pages=81–92  |year=2001  |pmid=11291099 |doi=10.1002/neu.1018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   If the fly's behavior changes, this gives a strong clue to what those neurons do.
* GECI ('''G'''enetically '''E'''ncoded '''C'''alcium '''I'''ndicator), often a member of the [[GCaMP]] family of proteins. These proteins fluoresce when exposed to [[calcium]], which, in most cells, happens when the neuron fires. This allows scientists to take pictures, or movies, that show the nervous system in operation.

For example, scientists can first visualize a class of neurons by choosing a fly from a GAL4 line that expresses GAL4 in the desired set of neurons, and crossing it with a reporter line that express GFP.  In the offspring, the desired subset of cells will make GAL4, and in these cells the GAL4 will bind to the UAS, and enable the production of GFP.  So the desired subset of cells will now fluoresce green and can be followed with a [[fluorescence microscope]]. Next, to figure out what these cells might do, the experimenter might express [[channelrhodopsin]] in each of these cells, by crossing the same GAL4 line with a channelrhodopsin reporter line. In the offspring the selected cells, and only those cells, will contain channelrhodopsin and can be triggered by a bright light. Now the scientist can trigger these particular cells at will, and examine the resulting behavior to see what these cells might do.

== Operation ==

'''[[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal4]]''' is a [[Protein domain|modular protein]] consisting broadly of a [[DNA-binding domain]] and an activation domain. The UAS to which GAL4 binds is CGG-N&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;-CCG, where N can be any [[nucleobase|base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Campbell, R. N. |author2=Leverentz, M.

Fischer |author2=Edward Giniger |author3=Tom Maniatis |author4=Mark Ptashne |year=1988 |title=GAL4 activates transcription in ''Drosophila'' |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=332 |issue=6167 |pages=853–6 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v332/n6167/abs/332853a0.html |doi=10.1038/332853a0|pmid=3128741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and human cells, highlighting that the same mechanisms for gene expression have been conserved over the course of evolution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Webster, N. |author2=Jin, J. R. |author3=Green, S. |author4=Hollis, M. |author5=Chambon, P. |year=1988 |title=The yeast UASG is a transcription enhancer in human HeLa cells in the presence of the GAL4 trans-activator |journal=Cell |volume=52 |issue=2 |pages=169–78 |pmid=2830022 |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(88)90505-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For study in ''Drosophila'', the GAL4 gene is placed under the control of a native gene [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], or driver gene, while the UAS controls expression of a target gene. GAL4 is then only expressed in cells where the driver gene is usually active. In turn, GAL4 should only activate gene transcription where a UAS has been introduced. For example, by fusing a gene encoding a visible marker like GFP ([[Green Fluorescent Protein]]) the expression pattern of the driver genes can be determined. GAL4 and the UAS are very useful for studying gene expression in ''Drosophila'' as they are not normally present and their expression does not interfere with other processes in the cell. For example, GAL4/UAS-regulated transgenes in ''Drosophila'' have been used to alter glial expression to produce arrhythmic behavior in a known [[Circadian rhythm|rhythmic circadian]] output called [[pigment dispersing factor]] (PDF).&lt;ref name="pmid21497088"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Ng, F.

The GAL4-UAS system has also been employed to study gene expression in organisms besides ''Drosophila'' such as the African clawed frog ''[[Xenopus]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Katharine O. Hartley |author2=Stephen L.

The GAL4/UAS system is also utilized in [[Two-hybrid screening|Two-Hybrid Screening]], a method of identifying interactions between two proteins or a protein with DNA.

==Extensions==
'''[[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal4]]''' expression can be made even more specific by means of "intersectional strategies". These can combine two different GAL4 lines—say, A and B—in a way that GAL4 is only expressed in the cells that are in line&amp;nbsp;A but not line&amp;nbsp;B, or those that are in both lines&amp;nbsp;A and B. When combined with intrinsically sparse GAL4 lines, this offers very specific selection, often limited to a single cell type. The disadvantage is that at least three independent insertion sites are required, so the lines must use different and independent insertion sites, and creating the desired final organisms needs more than a single cross. This is a very active field of research, and there are many such intersectional strategies, of which two are discussed below.

One way to create GAL4 expression in the cells that are in line&amp;nbsp;A but not line&amp;nbsp;B, requires line&amp;nbsp;A to be made to express GAL4, and line&amp;nbsp;B made to express '''[[Gal4 transcription factor|Gal80]]''', which is a GAL4 inhibitor.  Therefore, only the cells that are in A but not B will have active GAL4, which can then drive the [[reporter gene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Refining GAL4-driven transgene expression in Drosophila with a GAL80 enhancer-trap |authors=Suster, Maximiliano, L., Seugnet, Laurent, Bate, Michael, and Sokolowski, Marla B. |journal=Genesis |volume=39 |issue=4 |pages=240–245 |year=2004 |url=http://www.utm.utoronto.ca/~w3forage/Suster_2004b.pdf |doi=10.1002/gene.20051 |pmid=15286996 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gal80 intersectional regulation of cell-type specific expression in vertebrates  |author1=Fujimoto, Esther |author2=Gaynes, Brooke |author3=Brimley, Cameron |author4=J.

To express GAL4 in only the cells contained in both A and B, a technique called "split-GAL4" can be used. Line&amp;nbsp;A is made to express half of the GAL4 protein, which is inactive by itself.  Similarly, line&amp;nbsp;B is made to express the other half of GAL4, also inactive by itself.  Only the cells that are in both lines make both halves, which self-assemble by [[leucine zipper]] into GAL4 and activate the reporter gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Refined spatial manipulation of neuronal function by combinatorial restriction of transgene expression  |author1=Luan, Haojiang |author2=Peabody, Nathan C. |author3=Vinson, Charles R. |author4=White, Benjamin H. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Neuron

The ''' Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen ''' ({{lang-no|Geofysisk institutt, UiB}}) is a marine research facility located in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]]. Founded in 1917 by [[Bjørn Helland-Hansen]], the institute studies the field of [[oceanography]] dealing with the patterns of the weather in the [[North Atlantic Ocean]] off the coast of Norway. Within recent years, focus has been increasingly on [[geophysics]] and environmental research. The research activities at the institute span from small scale measurement of turbulence up to studies of the large scale ocean currents, from local [[Air pollution|air]] and [[noise pollution]] up to studies of global scale [[climate change]].

Areas of research focus on the [[Norwegian Current]], the [[West Spitsbergen Current]] and the [[Norwegian Sea]]. Shifts and fluctuations in these currents are monitored, as they are thought to be indicators for climate change. Research has included [[carbon sequestration|{{CO2}} sequestration]] and related matters dealing with [[Carbon capture and storage]].The director of the institute is Dr. [[Peter M. Haugan]].

The [[Bergen School of Meteorology]], which led to modern [[weather forecasting]], was developed at the Geophysical Institute by [[Vilhelm Bjerknes]] and collaborators (including [[Carl-Gustaf Rossby]]) beginning in 1917.

'''Healthism''', sometimes called '''public-healthism''', is a [[neologism]] to describe a variety of [[ideology|ideological]] constructs concerning health and medicine. The term "healthism" was most likely first used by the political economist [[Robert Crawford (political economist)|Robert Crawford]], whose article "Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Robert Crawford, ''Healthism and the medicalization of everyday life''. (Health:, Vol. 10, No. 4, 401-420 (2006))&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1980. In this article Crawford describes how the new political ideology, which emerged in the US during the 1970s, "[situated] the problem of health and disease at the level of the individual." The term is also known for its use in the 1994 book ''The Death of Humane Medicine and the Rise of Coercive Healthism'' by [[Petr Skrabanek]]. Skrabanek's use of "healthism", and most subsequent uses, are [[pejorative]] in intent. However, there is also a growing movement in the 21st century which see healthism as a positive empowering phenomenon which is not inherently coercive. This is exemplified through its popular uptake in the form of preventive medicine, yoga, meditation, fitness regimes, diets and the emphasis on lifestyle changes in Western society.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''United Nations High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development''' ('''HLPF''') is a subsidiary body of both the [[United Nations General Assembly]] and the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] responsible for the entire organization's policy on [[Sustainable development|sustainable development]]. It adopts negotiated declarations, reviews commitment and the progress of the [[2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development]]. The Forum replaced the [[Commission on Sustainable Development]] on the 24 September 2013 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/index.php?menu=1556 |title=High-level Political Forum |date=n.d. |website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=14 November 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meetings of the Forum are open to all Member States of the United Nations. 

== History ==

The HLPF has its origin in the '''Commission on Sustainable Development''' ('''CSD'''), which was created in 1992 to ensure follow-up of the [[Earth Summit|Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/intergovernmental/csd |title=Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) |date=n.d. |website= sustainabledevelopment.un.org |publisher=United Nations |access-date=November 14, 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This Commission met a total of 20 times, with its last session on 20 September 2013.

At the 2012 [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Conference on Sustainable Development]], or Rio+20, it was decided that the Commission would be replaced by the '''High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development.''' This new Forum would meet under the auspices of both the Economic and Social Council, as well as the General Assembly. The Forum was formally created by Resolution 67/290 on 9 July 2013. &lt;ref name="67-290"&gt;{{UN doc |docid=A-RES-67-290 |body=A |session=67 |type=R |resolution_number=290 |title= Format and Organizational Aspects of the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable Development |date=9 July 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the Forum is held under the authority of both the Economic and Social Council and the General Assembly, the body hosts two different types of meetings:
* While under the auspices of the General Assembly: Once every four years at the level of Heads of State and Government for a period of two days.
* While under the auspices of the Economic and Social Council: Yearly, for a period of eight days, including a three-day ministerial segment.
Its meetings are held in July.

In [[pathology]], '''hypertrophic decidual vasculopathy''', abbreviated '''HDV''', is the [[histomorphology|histomorphologic]] correlate of [[gestational hypertension]], as may be seen in [[intrauterine growth restriction]] (IUGR)&lt;ref name=pmid18641412&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Roberts | first1 = DJ. | last2 = Post | first2 = MD. | title = The placenta in pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 1254–60 |date=Dec 2008 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2008.055236 | PMID = 18641412 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[HELLP syndrome]].  

The name of the condition describes its appearance under the [[microscope]]; the [[smooth muscle]] of the [[decidua]]l (or [[mother|maternal]]) [[blood vessel]]s is [[hypertrophy|hypertrophic]], i.e. the muscle part of the blood vessels feeding the placenta is larger due to cellular enlargement.

==Morphologic features==
The morphologic features of mild and moderate HDV include:&lt;ref name=pmid18641412&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Roberts | first1 = DJ. | last2 = Post | first2 = MD. | title = The placenta in pre-eclampsia and intrauterine growth restriction. | journal = J Clin Pathol | volume = 61 | issue = 12 | pages = 1254–60 |date=Dec 2008 | doi = 10.1136/jcp.2008.055236 | PMID = 18641412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Perivascular inflammatory cells,

'''Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences''', CU (IFESCU) was established in 1976 as Institute of Forestry with the help of [[Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (Bangladesh)|Ministry of Environment and Forest]], and [[Bangladesh Forest Department]], under [[University of Chittagong]], [[Bangladesh]]. It's the pioneer institute for forestry education in Bangladesh. Later, it was renamed as Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences in 1996. The Institute started providing in-service training (Master of Forestry) to newly recruited ACF (Assistant Conservator of Forests) in 1977-78, regular 4-year B.Sc. (Hons.) in [[Forestry]] in 1978-79, M.Sc. in [[Forestry]] in 1996, B.Sc. (Hons.) in [[Environmental Science]] in 2000-2001 and M.Sc. in [[Environmental Science]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Forestry and Environmental Sciences |url=http://www.cu.ac.bd/ctguni/index.php?option=com_cudata&amp;task=institute%20of%20forestry%20and%20environmental%20sciences |publisher=University of Chittagong |accessdate=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Integrated enterprise modeling''' (IEM) is an [[enterprise modeling]] method used for the admission and for the [[Business process reengineering|reengineering]] of [[Business process|processes]] both in producing enterprises and in the public area and service providers. In integrated enterprise modeling different aspects as functions and data become described in one model. Furthermore, the method supports analyses of [[business process]]es independently of the available organizational structure.

The Integrated Enterprise Modeling is developed at the ''[[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer Institute]] for Production Systems and Design Technology (German: IPK) Berlin, Germany''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:de:Integrierte Unternehmensmodellierung|German page]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Integrated enterprise modeling topics==

===Base constructs===
[[Image:Generische Objektklassen der IUM 2.jpg|300px|thumb|Generic object classes of the IEM]]
[[Image:Beispielklassen.jpg|300px|thumb|Overview of the object classes product, order and resource]]
[[Image:Generisches Aktivitaetsmodell.jpg|300px|thumb|Generic activity model]]The integrated enterprise modeling (IEM) method uses an [[Object orientated|object-oriented]] approach and adapts this for the enterprise description. An application-oriented division of all elements of an enterprise forms the core of the method in generic object classes ''"product"'', ''"resource"'' and ''"order"''.

;Product

The object class "product" represents all objects whose production and sale are the aim of the looked-at-enterprise as well as all objects which flow into the end product. Raw materials, intermediate products, components and end products as well as services and the describing data are included.

;Order

The object class "order" describes all types of a commissioning in the enterprise. The objects of the class "order" represent the information which is relevant from the point of view of planning, control and supervision of the enterprise processes. One understands by it what, when, at which objects, in whose responsibility and with which resources it will be executed.

;Resource

The IEM class "resource" contains all necessary key players which are required in the enterprise for the execution or support of activities. Among other things these are employees, business partner, all kinds of documents as well as information systems or operating supplies.

The classes "product", "order", and "resource" can gradually be given full particulars and specified. Through this it is possible to show both line of business typical and enterprise specific product, order and resource subclasses. Structures (e.g. parts lists or organisation charts) can be shown as relational features of the classes with the help of being-part-of- and consists-of-relations between different subclasses.

; Action

The activities which are necessary for the production of products and to the provision of services can be described as follows: an activity is the purposeful change of objects. The aim orientation of the activities causes an explicit or implicit planning and control. The execution of the activities is incumbent by the capable key players. From these considerations the definitions can be derived for the following constructs:
* An ''action'' is an object neutral description of activities: a verbal description of a work task, a lawsuit or proceeding;
* A ''function'' describes the change of state of a defined status into another defined one of objects of a class by using an action;
* An ''activity'' specifies necessary resources for the state transformation of objects of a class the controlling order described by a function and these for the execution of this transformation in the enterprise, in each case represented by an object state description.

===Views===
All modeled data of the looked-at-enterprise are recorded in the model core of an Integrated Enterprise Modeling (IEM) model in two main [[View model|views]]:
* the "[[information model]]" and
* the "[[business process model]]".
All relevant objects of an enterprise, their qualities and relations are shown in the "information model". It is class trees of the object classes "product", "order" and "resource" here. The "business process model" represents enterprise processes and their relations to each other. Activities are shown in their interaction with the objects.

===Process modeling===
The structuring of the enterprise processes in Integrated Enterprise Modeling (IEM) is reached by its hierarchical subdivision with the help of the decomposition. Decomposition means the reduction of a system in a partial system which respectively contains components which are in a logical cohesion. The process modeling is a partitioning of processes into its threads. Every thread describes a task completed into itself. The [[Decomposition (computer science)|decomposition]] of single processes can be carried out long enough until the threads are manageable, i.e. appropriately small. They may turn out also not too rudimentary because a high number of detailed processes increases the complexity of a business process model. A process modeling person therefore have to find a balance between the effort complexity degree of the model and possible detailed description of the enterprise processes. A model depth generally recommends itself with at most three to four decomposition levels (model levels).

&lt;gallery class="center"&gt;
Image:elemente 1 Sequenz.jpg|Sequential order
Image:Elemente 2 Verzweigung.jpg|Parallel branching
Image:Elemente 3 Fallunterscheidung.jpg|Case distinction
Image:Elemente 4 Zusammenfuehrung.jpg|Uniting
Image:Elemente 5 Schleife.jpg|Loop
&lt;/gallery&gt;

On a model level business process flows are represented with the aid of illustrated combination elements. There are these five basic types of combinations between the activities:
* Sequential orde: At a sequential order the activities are executed after each other.
* Parallel branching: A parallel branching means that all parallel branched activities to be executed have to be completed before the following activity can be started with. It is not necessary that the parallel activities are executed at the same time. They can be deferredly carried out, too.
* Case distinction: Decision either or. The case distinction is a branching in alternative processes depending on definition of the subsequent conditions.
* Uniting: The end of a parallel as the case may be alternative execution or also an integration of process chains is indicated by the uniting.
* Loop: A repatriation (loop, cycle) is represented by means of case distinction and uniting. The activities included in the loop are executed as long as the condition for the continuation is given.

===Modeling proceeding===
The modeling procedure for the illustration of business processes in IEM covers the following steps:
* System [[delimitation]],
* Modeling,
* Model evaluation and use,
* Model change.

The ''system delimitation'' is the base of an efficient modeling. Starting out from a conceptual formulation the area of the real system to be shown is selected and interfaces will be defined to an environment. In addition, the detail depth of the model is also determined, i.e. the depth of the hierarchical decomposition relations in the view "business process model".

The delimited real system is convicted with help of the IEM method in an abstract model. IEM is the construction of the two main positions "information model" and "business process model". The "information model" is made by the specification of the object classes to be modeled for "product", "order" and "resource" with the class structures as well as descriptive and relational features. By identification and description of functions, activities and its combination to processes the "business process model" is formed. As a general rule the construction of the "information model" follows first in which the modeling person can go back to available reference class structures. The reference classes which do not correspond to the real system or were not found to be relevant at the system delimitation are deleted. The missing relevant classes are inserted. After the object base is fixed, the activities and functions are joined together at the objects according to the "generic activity model" and with the help of combination elements to business processes. A model is made which can be analysed and changed if it's required. It often happens, that during the construction of the "business process model" new relevant object classes are identified so that the class trees getting completed. The construction of the two positions is therefore an iterative process.

Afterwards weak points and improvement potentials can be identified in the course of the ''model evaluation''. This can cause the ''model changes'' whose realization should clear the weak points and make use of the improvement potentials in the real system.

===Modeling tool MO²GO===
The software tool MO²GO (method for an object-oriented business process optimization) supports the modeling process based on the integrated enterprise modeling (IEM). Different analyses of a given model are available like the planning and implementation of information systems. The MO²GO system is expandable easily and makes a high-speed modeling approach possible.

The currently used MO²GO system consists of the following components:
* MO²GO version 2.4: This component offers modeling functions for class structures, process chains and mechanism for analysis of IEM.
* MO²GO Macro editor version 2.1 : The macro editor supports the outline of MO²GO [[Macro (computer science)|macros]] for user-defined evaluation procedures.
* MO²GO Viewer version 1.07 : The Java-based and licence free MO²GO Viewer is a user interface to be used easily to navigate process chains through MO²GO.
* MO²GO XML converter version 1.0 : Nowadays the IT implementation works mainly with [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] diagrams. MO²GO supports a component for a model based [[Xml|XML]] file which can be imported in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]] tools.
* MO²GO Web publisher version 2.0 : The web Publisher is a mechanism of analysis to be started directly out of MO²GO 2.4. A process assistant is the result of the evaluation of the model contents based on texture and [[hyperlink]] representation. To be able to adapt the process assistant to the user requirements flexibly, the web Publisher contains a configuration component.

===MO²GO process assistant===
[[Image:screenshot prozessassistent.jpg|300px|thumb|Prozess assistant]]
The IEM business process models contain much information which can not only be used by system analysts but also be helpful for the employees at their daily work. To provide this model information for the staff and to enable the participation of the employees for the results of the modeling, a special tool was developed at the [[Fraunhofer Society|Fraunhofer]] IPK. This is a web based process assistant whose contents are generated automatically from the IEM business process model of the enterprise. The process assistant provides all users the information of the business process model in a [[Html|HTML]] based form by intranet of the enterprise. For its implementation no special methods or tool knowledge is required besides the basic EDP and Internet experiences.

The process assistant has been developed so that the employees can find answers to the questions fast and precisely: e.g.
* What are the processes in the enterprise?
* In which way are they structured as?
* Who and with which responsibility is involved in the certain process?
* Which documents and application systems are used?

Or also:
* A certain organisation unit is involved at which processes?
* Or in which processes a certain document or an application system is used?

To make an informative process assistant from the business process model, certain modeling rules must be followed. The means e.g. that the individual actions must be deposited with its descriptions, the responsibility of the organisation units must be indicated explicitly or the paths also must be entered to the documents in the class tree. The fulfilment of these conditions means an additional time expenditure at the modeling, if these conditions are met, all employees are able to ''"surf"'' online through the [[intranet]] with the help of the process assistant by an informative enterprise documentation. They have the possibility between a graphic view and a texture based description according to their preferences and methodical previous knowledge. The graphic view is provided by the MO²GO Viewer, a viewer tool for MO²GO models. The process assistant and the MO²GO Viewer are connected so that the graphic representation of the process looked at can be accessed context sensitively from the process assistant.

Users can call on all templates, specifications and documents for the working sequence both from the process assistant and from the MO²GO Viewer online. Therefore, the process assistant cannot only be employed for the tracing of the modeling results but also in the daily business for the training of new employees as well as execution of process steps. To improve the usability in the daily routine, the process assistant can be adapted to the needs of the users flexibility. This customization can be carried out both concerning the layout and concerning the main content emphases of the process assistant.

==Areas of application of the IEM==
Knowledge is used in organisations as a resource to render services for customers. The service preparation performs along actions which are described as processes or business processes. The analysis and improvement in dealing with knowledge presupposes a common idea about this context. An explicit description of the processes therefore is required because they represent the context for the respective knowledge contents. The process modeling represents a powerful instrument for the design and a conversion of a process-oriented [[knowledge management]]. In the context of the method of the business process-oriented [[knowledge management]] (GPO KM) developed at the [[Fraunhofer society|Fraunhofer]] IPK the method of the "integrated enterprise modeling" (IEM) is accessed. It makes it possible to be able to show, to describe, to analyse and to form organisational processes. The IEM features few object classes, is ascertainable easily understandable and fast. Furthermore, the object orientation of the IEM opens up the possibility of showing knowledge as an object class. For the knowledge-oriented modeling of the business processes according to the IEM method the relevant knowledge contents have to be specified after knowledge domains and know-how bearers and represented as resources in the business process model.

In further applications IEM is used to create models across organisations (e.g. companies)to archive a common understanding between the involved stakeholders and derive services (create software and define the ASP). In this context the object oriented basis of IEM has been used to create a common semantic across the single company models and to archive compliant enterprise models (predefined classes – terminology, model templates, etc.). The reason is that the terminology used within a model has to be understandable independent of the modeling language, see also [[SDDEM]].

In the United States, a '''judicial intern''' (also commonly known as a "'''judicial extern'''" or "'''extern law clerk'''" &lt;ref&gt;Externship Job Description, Los Angeles Superior Court http://www.lasuperiorcourt.org/VolunteerOpportunities/UI/volunteerIEP/judicialOfficerAdults.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;) is usually a [[law student]] or sometimes a recent [[law school]] graduate who provides assistance to a [[judge]] and/or [[law clerks]] in researching and writing issues before the court. Working as a judicial intern allows law students to gain practical legal experience and familiarity with the court operations.

==Description==
Many judicial interns subsequently choose to work full-time as judicial law clerks immediately after graduation. These judicial "clerkships" generally last one year in which the law clerk works closely with the judge in assisting various matters before the court. Judicial clerkships tend to be a valuable experience to an attorney's career because of the work involved in both substantive and procedural issues. In many cases, a clerkship is a critical stepping stone into real practice. Most, if not all, major law firms pay "clerkship" bonuses to new associates who have completed a full one year clerkship term. &lt;ref&gt;The National Association for Law Placement (NALP) Study on Law School Activities (Reported by Students Receiving an Offer for a Judicial Clerkship) http://www.nalp.org/content/index.php?pid=219#29&lt;/ref&gt;  

Among the most prestigious judicial internships are those in the federal court of appeals, federal district courts, and in the state's supreme court. 

A judicial intern's selection process is similar to judicial clerkship positions.  Grades, class ranking, and relevant extracurricular activities such as membership in the law school's law review or being a member of the law school's Moot Court Board are common criteria in selecting a judicial intern.&lt;ref&gt;The American Bar Association's Frequently Asked Questions page on Judicial Internship Selection Criterion http://www.abanet.org/litigation/jiop/faq.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Just Gjessing''' (Oslo, 13 July 1926 – 29 October 2005) was a Norwegian geographer.&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/Just_Gjessing Just Gjessing], [[Store Norske Leksikon]]&lt;/ref&gt; Gjessing obtained a Ph.D. degree in 1960 with a study on Norway’s [[hydrology]] during [[deglaciation]]. One year later he was appointed full professor. In the late 1960s Gjessing became increasingly interested in nature conservation so that in the 1970s shifted the focus of his research into [[environmental impact assessment]]s. This meant leaving behind his work on pure [[fluvial geomorphology]] that had previously brought him acclaim. Following this interest he joined in 1967 the Oslo University’s Commission for Watercourse Regulation. In 1971 he became chairman of the commission while also entering the Joint Commission for Hydroelectric Power Development and Nature Conservation, of which he was a member until 1981. He co-authored various notable books including ''Beste Store Norge Atlas'' (1983) and the five volume work ''Norge'' (1984–1986) and the journal ''[[Norsk Geografisk Tidsskrift]]'' from 1979 to 1987. In the 1980s the work of Gjessing turned increasingly international with many travels to [[West Africa|West]] and [[North Africa]] where he studied environmental issues in arid and semi-arid landscapes.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en&gt;{{cite journal|author-last=Trondalen|author-first=Jon Martin |date=2006|title=Professor Just Gjessing: ‘A journey with a purpouse’ |journal=[[Norwegian Journal of Geography]] |volume=60|issue=|pages=161–164}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Gjessing’s personality and approach made him subject of strong and lasting criticism from so-called “rejectionist” even within his own department at the [[University of Oslo]]. Despite their opposition Gjessing managed to establish the course Resource Geography and Landscape Ecology in 1985, attending student demands that had emerged in the 1970s about the need of courses on natural resources and environmental management.&lt;ref name=Trondalen200en/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4292">The theory of the '''least objectionable program''' ('''LOP''') is a [[Mediology|mediological]] theory explaining television audience behavior. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1979/03/06/nbcees-paul-klein-to-the-door/998c31db-7e66-4bc0-bbd3-b3090f0b97d1/?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.5d4109eb41b1 NBCees Paul Klein To the Door-The Washington Post]&lt;/ref&gt; It was developed in the 1960s by then executive of audience measurement at [[NBC]], [[Paul L. Klein]], &lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/1998/scene/people-news/paul-l-klein-1117882432/ Paul L. Klein-Variety]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1998/07/13/business/paul-l-klein-69-a-developer-of-pay-per-view-tv-channels.html Paul Klein obituary], ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; who was greatly influenced by the media theorist [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man|Understanding Media]]''.

== "Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch" ==

In an article "Why You Watch What You Watch When You Watch" (published in ''[[TV Guide]]'' in 1971&lt;ref&gt;Klein, P. (July 24, 1971). Why you watch what you watch when you watch. TV Guide, 6-9.&lt;/ref&gt;), Klein explained that viewers consume the medium of [[television]] rather than [[Television program|television shows]], treating the medium as the end of their consumption itself rather than using the set as a means to access specific programs they like the way they might choose a book from a shelf to access the story within. Since the introduction of television, the same percentage of sets are in use on, say, a Thursday evening at a certain hour, year after year, regardless of what content is broadcast. This is because unlike the way people use books, museums, or the cinema as means of consuming desired content, audiences consume television, the medium, as the desired object. TV viewers turn the set on, deciding to "watch television", and then seek out something to watch from what is available, flipping around, not until they find "something they like" - because television programming is in fact very rarely satisfying, and viewers rarely watch anything they actually like - but until they find something that doesn't offend them enough to make them flip to the next channel. (Viewers almost never turn off the set as a result of finding nothing tolerable and judging every program available boring or otherwise objectionable. Viewers commonly watch programs they describe later as unbearable, everything else on being even more intolerable. A more common response to a whole spectrum of equally unendurable choices than choosing to abandon the medium is to continue to flip frequently until new choices become available.) Thus, for programmers of television channels, Klein recommended understanding that audience attraction was a matter not of pleasing the greatest number of viewers but of offending the fewest (driving the fewest away to the competitors who may repulse them less). The television audience is in a kind of partial trance. A network will do better worrying less about not giving an audience enough to like, to be surprised and delighted by, and to engage their attention, than about avoiding, as Klein said, "disturbing their reverie" with something that causes them to change the channel. Thus, even as channel choices proliferate alongside numerous easily accessed out-of-schedule viewing options, successful television programs remain, as they have always been, formulaic, cliché, "instantly familiar," predictable, and monotonous in tone.

== Obsolescence of the theory ==
It has been widely suggested that the theory itself is obsolete thanks to high [[quality television|quality shows]], top-rated options and viewers' choice of shows whether live or time-shifted alongside the advancements of [[DVD]]s and [[Netflix]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tvguide.com/news/too-much-tv-1060072/ As More Networks Develop Series, Is There Too Much TV?-TV Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8680">{{Wittgenstein|Movements}}

The '''linguistic turn''' was a major development in [[Western philosophy]] during the early 20th century, the most important characteristic of which is the focusing of [[philosophy]] and the other [[humanities]] primarily on the relationship between philosophy and [[language]].

Very different intellectual movements were associated with the "linguistic turn", although the term itself is commonly thought popularised by [[Richard Rorty]]'s 1967 anthology ''The Linguistic Turn'', in which it means the turn towards [[linguistic philosophy]]. According to Rorty, who later dissociated himself from linguistic philosophy and analytic philosophy generally, the phrase "the linguistic turn" originated with philosopher [[Gustav Bergmann]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Rorty]], "Wittgenstein, Heidegger, and the Reification of Language" in Richard Rorty, ''Essays on Heidegger and Others: Philosophical Papers'', Cambridge University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Gross, ''Richard Rorty: The Making of an American Philosopher'', University Of Chicago Press, 2008, p. xxix.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analytic philosophy==
Traditionally, the linguistic turn is taken to also mean the birth of [[analytic philosophy]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/38153975|title=Origins of analytical philosophy|last=Dummett|first=Michael A.|date=|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=|isbn=0674644735|location=Cambridge. Mass.|pages=5|oclc=38153975}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the results of the linguistic turn was an increasing focus on [[logic]] and [[philosophy of language]], and the cleavage between [[Linguistic philosophy|ideal language philosophy]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]].

===Frege===
According to [[Michael Dummett]], the linguistic turn can be dated to [[Gottlob Frege]]'s 1884 work ''[[The Foundations of Arithmetic]]'', specifically paragraph 62 where Frege explores the identity of a numerical proposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/lang-phi/#SH1b|title=Language, Philosophy of – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author=|date=|website=www.iep.utm.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Dummett, "Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics"&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order to answer a [[Immanuel Kant|Kantian]] question about [[Number|numbers]], "How are numbers given to us, granted that we have no idea or intuition of them?" Frege invokes his "[[context principle]]", stated at the beginning of the book, that only in the context of a proposition do words have meaning, and thus finds the solution to be in defining "the sense of a proposition in which a number word occurs." Thus an [[Ontology|ontological]] and [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem, traditionally solved along [[Idealism|idealist]] lines, is instead solved along [[Linguistics|linguistic]] ones.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Russell and Wittgenstein===
This concern for the logic of propositions and their relationship to "facts" was later taken up by the notable analytic philosopher [[Bertrand Russell]] in "[[On Denoting]]", and played a weighty role in his early work in [[logical atomism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist-analytic.com/RussellLAfacts.pdf The Philosophy of Physical Atomism], p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], an associate of Russell, was one of the progenitors of the linguistic turn. This follows from his ideas in his ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'' that philosophical problems arise from a misunderstanding of the logic of language, and from his remarks on [[Language game (philosophy)|language games]] in his later work. His later work (specifically ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'') significantly departs from the common tenets of analytic philosophy and might be viewed as having some resonance in the post-structuralist tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Although Wittgenstein never used the term Linguistic turn. See  [http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/scr/hacker/docs/Beyond%20the%20linguistic%20turn%20.pdf Analytic Philosophy: Beyond the Linguistic Turn and Back Again] (St. Johns College website)&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Quine and Kripke===
[[W. V. O. Quine]] describes the historical continuity of the linguistic turn with earlier philosophy in [[Two Dogmas of Empiricism|''Two Dogmas of Empiricism'']]: "[[Intension|Meaning]] is what [[essence]] becomes when it is divorced from the object of reference and wedded to the word."&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Two Dogmas of Empiricism''&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the twentieth century, philosophers like [[Saul Kripke]] in ''[[Naming and Necessity]]'' drew metaphysical conclusions from closely analyzing language.&lt;ref name="Garrett2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Brian Garrett|title=What Is This Thing Called Metaphysics?|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qTmJrtBX-ZkC&amp;pg=PA54|date=25 February 2011|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-79269-4|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Continental philosophy ==
Decisive for the linguistic turn in the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[Continental philosophy|Continental]] [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Structuralism was the initial outcome of Saussure's linguistic turn, which later led to [[poststructuralism]] with the input of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s ideas.&lt;ref&gt;David Kreps, ''Bergson, Complexity and Creative Emergence'', Springer, 2015, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Influential poststructuralist theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]].

These various movements often lead to the notion that language 'constitutes' reality, a position contrary to intuition and to most of the Western tradition of philosophy. The traditional view (what Derrida called the 'metaphysical' core of Western thought) saw words as functioning labels attached to concepts.  According to this view, there is something like 'the ''real'' chair', which exists in some external reality and corresponds roughly with a concept in human thought, ''chair'', to which the linguistic word "chair" refers. However, the founder of structuralism, Ferdinand de Saussure, held that definitions of concepts cannot exist independently from a linguistic system defined by difference, or, to put it differently, that a concept of something cannot exist without being named. Thus differences between meanings structure our perception; there is no ''real'' chair except insofar as we are manipulating symbolic systems. We would not even be able to recognize a chair ''as'' a chair without simultaneously recognising that a chair is ''not'' everything else - in other words a chair is defined as being a specific collection of characteristics which are themselves defined in certain ways, and so on, and all of this within the symbolic system of language. Thus, a large part of what we think of as ''reality'' is really a convention of naming and characterising, a convention which is itself called ''language''.

Theories of [[mental representation]] are those that rest the [[cognitive abilities]] of the mind on the processing of content-laden vehicles, called representations.  Naturalizing these theories involves an account of how a representation, initially posited as a theoretical construct, can be realized in a physical system.  A central aspect of any account of representation is how they derive and designate semantic content.  The possession of meaningful content is the most characteristic property of representations and arguably integral to their functionality.&lt;ref name=Ramsey2007/&gt; The project of the naturalistic philosopher is to provide an account of the representation relationship between a representation ''A'' and its object of intentional content ''a'', such that having content ''A'' is entailed by standing in a particular relation with ''a''.&lt;ref name=Morgan2014/&gt;

One naturalistic account of the representation relationship is the teleofunctionalist semantics of [[Fred Dretske]].  In his book ''Explaining Behavior'', Dretske outlines a theory for how a component of a physical system can come to possess semantic content.  This theory characterizes a relationship as representational when: one entity is a natural sign of another, and the natural sign is integrated into the function of a larger system as a consequence of being an indicator.

Natural signs are those entities whose existence is dependent on preceding conditions.  Therefore, the existence of a natural sign is an indication that its preceding conditions are or were actually instantiated.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; For example, footprints in the snow are dependent on the animal that creates them, thus footprints are natural signs.  Exactly what the footprints in the snow indicate, or are natural signs of, is potentially limitless.  A man’s footprint could indicate his size, approximate weight, fashion preferences, even infirmities if there are characteristics of a limp.  Conversely, a representation’s content is not as broad, nor as unspecified.  As a result, an indication relationship could be necessary for a representation relationship, but not sufficient.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; Furthermore, natural signs are dependent on the actual existence of their instantiating conditions while representations bear no such dependency relationships.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; This is the critical feature that allows representations to misrepresent something as the case when it is indeed not.

For a natural sign to become a representation requires additional constraining criteria that designate specific content from among many conditions indicated and free the indicator from absolute dependency on the existence of its instantiating conditions.  The teleological characteristics of Dretske’s theory are intended to accomplish the necessary constraints.  Specifically, to be a representation, a natural sign must be employed in the function of a larger system as a result of its holding in an indication relationship.  Since a natural sign may hold in many indication relationships, that relationship for which it is employed by the larger system is taken to be its content-specifying relationship.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt;

By being integrated into the function of a larger system, natural signs also become free of an absolute dependency on the existence of their instantiating conditions.  By contributing its properties of indication to a larger system, a natural sign gains the function of determining what the system takes to be the case.&lt;ref name=Dretske1988/&gt; Once this role has been given, changes in what the natural sign indicate are not necessarily reflected in what the system takes the case to be.  Thus, when appropriately integrated, natural signs become representations by identifying specific content and gaining freedom from absolute dependency on their instantiating conditions.

A major criticism of applying naturalistic theories of semantics to mental representation is that they fail to account for all the characteristics of mental states.  Mental states have characteristic phenomenal properties and these properties are not necessitated by naturalistic theories of semantics.  That is to say, these theories identify representations, with equal weight, in both conscious and unconscious systems.&lt;ref name=Morgan2014/&gt;  If an explanation is consistent with the absence of phenomenal properties, then it cannot be a full account of mental states.  While this objection does nothing to undermine the progress of naturalistic theories of semantics, it demands that there are further constraining criteria before representation in mental states can be accounted for.

'''''Planet Earth: The Future''''' is a 2006 [[BBC]] [[documentary]] series on the environment and conservation, produced by the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] as a companion to the multi-award winning [[nature documentary]] ''[[Planet Earth (2006 TV series)|Planet Earth]]''. The programmes were originally [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] on [[BBC Four]] immediately after the final three episodes of ''Planet Earth'' on [[BBC One]]. Each episode highlights the conservation issues surrounding some of the [[species]] and environments featured in ''Planet Earth'', using interviews with the film-makers and eminent figures from the fields of [[science]], [[conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[politics]], and [[theology]]. The programmes are narrated by Simon Poland and the series producer was [[Fergus Beeley]].

==Background==
When the first episodes of ''Planet Earth'' were broadcast in the [[UK]], the producers were criticised by some green campaigners for glossing over the [[environmental problem]]s faced by the planet. Executive producer [[Alastair Fothergill]] defended the approach, explaining that a heavy-handed environmental message would not work on primetime [[BBC One]]. However, the ''Planet Earth'' film crews witnessed first-hand scenes of [[environmental degradation]] and the increasing scarcity of wildlife in some of the shooting locations. This experience formed the basis of ''Planet Earth - The Future'', which was designed to engage viewers in a mature debate about [[environmental issues]].

The following year, the BBC commissioned ''[[Saving Planet Earth]]'', the second overtly conservation-themed series to be shown on [[BBC One]]. The first BBC series to deal comprehensively with conservation was ''[[State of the Planet]]'' in 2000.

 |ShortSummary    = The first programme asks if there really is an [[extinction]] crisis facing certain species. Alastair Fothergill, executive producer of ''Planet Earth'', admits that making the series was a bittersweet experience since some creatures were filmed with the knowledge that their continued existence is under threat. David Attenborough believes that conservation of the [[natural environment|natural world]] is something that can unite humanity if people know enough about it. Cameraman Martyn Colbeck relates that every single day during a six-week [[Africa]]n visit to film for "Jungles", he and his crew were awakened by the sound of gunshots. [[Poaching]] can quickly wipe out a population, and David Greer of the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] explains that in 2005 his team confiscated 70 guns in the area — a 700% increase from 1999. Other featured animals at risk include the [[walia ibex]], the [[snow leopard]], the [[boto]], and [[saiga antelope]]. The attack of a [[polar bear]] on a [[walrus]] colony on dry land in "Ice Worlds" was a rare occurrence. Footage from a 1997 ''[[BBC Wildlife Specials|BBC Wildlife Special]]'' shows the bears hunting smaller prey on sea ice. Species have always become extinct, but now, the viewer is told, the rate of extinction is accelerating (see [[Holocene extinction]]) and it will "really reach biblical proportions within a few decades." Mankind is urged to respect [[biodiversity]]: it is estimated that if a monetary value could be put on all that the world's [[ecosystem]]s do for humanity, it would total some [[US$]]30 trillion.

 |Title           = Into the Wilderness
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|03|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The second part looks at man's potential effect on the world's areas of [[wilderness]]. As the [[human population]] has grown, only a quarter of Earth's land now remains uninhabited (aside from [[Antarctica]]). Although around 12% is protected, this may not be enough — providing such places are not just 'enclosures' and bordering territories are also managed. [[Ethiopia]]'s [[Semien Mountains]] are increasingly encroached upon for farming land, and this example leads to the question of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]. Some interviewees argue that it is not just about numbers: how humans consume their [[natural resources]] is also important. However, others believe that the world would be greatly more sustainable if the population level was reduced to about half its current level. [[Jonathon Porritt]] believes that this could be achieved simply: by good education on [[family planning]]. Consumption of [[fresh water]] is highlighted: there are now 40,000 more dams in existence than in 1950. The controversy over drilling for oil in the [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]] is discussed by both its advocates and opponents. [[E. O. Wilson]]'s concept of [[Biophilia hypothesis|biophilia]] is discussed, and David Attenborough believes that a child's innate love of wildlife, for whatever reason, is being lost in adulthood. An answer to [[deforestation]] is found in [[Costa Rica]], where farmers are paid to allow their pasture to revert to forest for its water [[ecosystem services]]. The also deals with [[climate change]] and related [[global warming]], which is now happening at a faster rate than ever before.

 |EpisodeNumber   = 3
 |Title           = Living Together
 |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2006|12|10|df=y}}
 |ShortSummary    = The last episode deals with the future of conservation. It begins by looking at previous efforts. The 'Save The Whales' campaign, which started in the 1960s, is seen to have had a limited effect, as [[whaling]] continues and fish stocks also decline. In the 1990s, as head of the [[Kenya Wildlife Service]], [[Richard Leakey]] took on the poachers by employing armed units. Although it was successful in saving [[elephant]]s, the policy was detrimental to the [[Maasai people]], who were forced from their land. The need for "fortress" areas is questioned, and the recently highlighted [[Raja Ampat]] [[coral reef]] in [[Indonesia]] is an example. The more [[tourism]] it generates, the greater the potential for damage — and inevitable coastal construction. [[Sustainable development]] is viewed as controversial, and one contributor perceives it to currently be a "contradiction in terms". [[Trophy hunting]] is also contentious. Those that support it argue that it generates wealth for local economies, while its opponents point to the reducing numbers of species such as the [[markhor]]. [[Ecotourism]] is shown to be beneficial, as it is in the interests of its providers to protect their environments. However, in some areas, such as the [[Borneo]] [[rainforest]]s, the great diversity of species is being replaced by [[monoculture]]s. The role of both [[Religion and environmentalism|religion]] and the media in conservation is argued to be extremely important. Contributors to the programme admit a degree of worry about the future, but also optimism.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5814">'''Polynomial texture mapping''', also known as '''Reflectance Transformation Imaging''' (RTI), is a technique of [[Digital imaging|imaging]] and  [[Interactive media|interactively]] displaying objects under varying [[lighting]] conditions to reveal surface phenomena.

==Origins==
The method was originally developed by Tom Malzbender of [[HP Labs]] in order to generate enhanced [[3D computer graphics]] and it has since been adopted for [[cultural heritage]] applications.&lt;ref name="Economist"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/15767271?story_id=15767271 |title=Archaeology and polynomial texture mapping |work=[[The Economist]] |date=25 March 2010 |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methodology==
A series of images is captured in a darkened room with the [[camera]] in a fixed position and the object lit from different angles. These images are then processed and combined to enable a [[virtual artifact|virtual]] light source to be controlled by the user inspecting the object.&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt; The virtual light source may be manipulated to simulate light from different [[angle]]s and of different [[irradiance|intensity]] or [[wavelengths]] to illuminate the surface of artefacts and reveal details.&lt;ref name="Economist"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ACRG"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/archaeology/acrg/acrg_research_PTM.html |title=Polynomial texture mapping |publisher=[[University of Southampton]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Open source tools for processing the captured images and publishing the resulting relightable images on the web are freely available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/rti/index.php |title=Reflectance Transformation Imaging (RTI) Tools | publisher= Visual Computing Lab - [[ISTI]] - [[National Research Council (Italy)|CNR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Polynomial texture mapping may be used for detailed recording and documentation, [[3D modelling]], [[edge detection]], and to aid the study of [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] and other artefacts.&lt;ref name="ACRG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.southampton.ac.uk/archaeology/acrg/acrg_research_herculaneum_PTM.html |title=Polynomial texture mapping |publisher=[[University of Southampton]] |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been applied to hundreds of the [[Vindolanda tablets]] by the [[Centre for the Study of Ancient Documents]] at the [[University of Oxford]] in conjunction with the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://eprints.soton.ac.uk/156253/ |journal=Journal of Archaeological Science |title=Archaeological applications of polynomial texture mapping: analysis, conservation and representation |year=2010 |pages=1–11 |publisher=[[Elsevier]] |author=Earl, Graeme (''et al.'') |accessdate=8 March 2011|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2010.03.009 |volume=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been deployed, by Ben Altshuler of the [[Institute for Digital Archaeology]], to scan the [[Philae obelisk]] at [[Kingston Lacy]], and the [[Parian Chronicle]] at the [[Ashmolean Museum]]; in both cases scans revealed significant, previously illegible text.&lt;ref name=IDA&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parian Marble at The Ashmolean Museum|url=http://digitalarchaeology.org.uk/projects|website=Institute for Digital Archaeology|publisher=IDA|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altshuler|first1=Ben F S|last2=Mannack|first2=Thomas|title=Shedding New Light on Ancient Objects|journal=Arion: A Journal of Humanities and the Classics|date=2014|volume=22|issue=1|pages=53–74|doi=10.2307/arion.22.1.0053|jstor=arion.22.1.0053}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'dome' supporting twenty-four lights has been used to image paintings in the [[National Gallery]] and produce polynomial texture maps, providing information on condition phenomena for [[Conservation-restoration|conservation]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Digital Heritage:Applying Digital Imaging to Cultural Heritage |chapter=Digital Imaging for Easel Paintings |pages=525 ff |author=MacDonald, Lindsay (ed.) |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |year=2006 |ISBN=0-7506-6183-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies of the technique at the [[National Gallery]] and [[Tate]] concluded that it is an effective tool for documenting changes in the condition of paintings, more easily repeatable than [[raking light]] photography, and therefore could be used to assess paintings during structural treatment and before and after loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/jcms.1021201 |doi=10.5334/jcms.1021201|journal=Journal of Conservation and Museum Studies |title=Imaging Techniques in Conservation |year=2012 |pages=17–29 |publisher=[[Ubiquity Press]] |author=Payne, Emma Marie |accessdate=17 March 2013 |volume=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique is now also finding uses in the field of [[forensic science]], for example in imaging footprints, tyre marks and indented writing.

'''Prehistoric archaeology''' is the study of the past before historical records began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=1662101 |pmid=17758391 |title=Prehistoric Archeology, Past, Present and Future |first=N. C. |last=Nelson |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=85 |issue=2195 |date=22 January 1937 |pages=81-89 |publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] |doi=10.1126/science.85.2195.81}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a field of research that looks at all the pre-urban societies of the world. It also has distinctive set of procedures for analyzing material remains so that archaeologists can reconstruct their ecological settings. The study of prehistoric archaeology reflects the cultural concerns of modern society by showing interpretations of time between economic growth and political stability.&lt;ref name=Fagan&gt;{{cite book |year=1996 |title=The Oxford Companion to Archaeology |first=Brian M. |last=Fagan |author-link=Brian M. Fagan |edition=1st |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=9780199891085 |doi=10.1093/acref/9780195076189.001.0001 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=ystMAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover |oclc=35178577}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has very close links with biology, biological anthropology, and geology.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt; It is also sometimes termed at anthropological archaeology because of its indirect traces with complex patterns.&lt;ref name=Fagan/&gt;

In Western Europe the prehistoric period generally ends with [[Roman empire|Roman]] colonisation although in many other places, notably [[Egypt]] and [[China]], it finishes much earlier and in others, such as [[Australia]], much later. A transitional phase of [[protohistory]] or [[protohistoric archaeology]] may exist where written records provide a limited picture of the society in question.

The earliest record of the word ''prehistoric'' comes from the French archaeologist and scientist [[Paul Tournal]] who used it in 1831 to describe the finds he made in ancient caves he had investigated in the [[Bize-Minervois]] in the south of France. It did not enter English as an archeological term until 1851 when it was used by the Scots-Canadian archaeologist Sir [[Daniel Wilson (academic)|Daniel Wilson]]. The [[three-age system]], which just predates the coining of the term, was created in an attempt to make sense of the chronology of prehistoric Europe.

Without history to provide evidence for names, places and motivations, prehistoric archaeologists speak in terms of [[archaeological culture|culture]]s which can only be given arbitrary modern names relating to the locations of known occupation sites or the [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s used. It is naturally much easier to discuss societies rather than individuals as these past people are completely anonymous in the archaeological record.

Such a lack of concrete information means that prehistoric archaeology is a contentious field and the arguments that rage over it have done much to inform [[archaeological theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://revistas.ucm.es/index.php/CMPL/article/viewFile/43364/41036 |title=Why the history of archaeology is essential to theoretical archaeology |first=Tim |last=Murray |author-link=Tim Murray (archaeologist) |journal=Complutum |date=17 June 2013 |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=21-31 |issn=1131-6993 |doi=10.5209/rev_CMPL.2013.v24.n2.43364 |format=PDF |access-date=2 October 2018 |publisher=[[Universidad Complutense de Madrid]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The variety of theories regarding the purpose of objects or sites for example obliges archaeologists to adopt a critical approach to all evidence and to examine their own constructs of the past.

"'''Prick Up Your Ears'''" is the sixth episode of the [[Family Guy (season 5)|fifth season]] of ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on November 19, 2006. In this episode, Lois discovers that Chris' school has removed the [[sex education]] program due to budget cuts and decides to bring the class back by becoming the teacher. Unfortunately, she gets fired a short time later for teaching the students about safe sex rather than abstinence. Meanwhile, Stewie attempts to find and kill the [[Tooth Fairy]] after being told "horror" stories by Brian.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b007thh4|title=Prick Up Your Ears: Brief plot synopsis|accessdate=2007-12-14|year=2006|publisher=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was written by [[Cherry Chevapravatdumrong]] and directed by [[James Purdum]]. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and many cultural references. According to [[Nielsen ratings]], it was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing. The episode featured guest performances by [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mindy Cohn]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Taylor Cole]], [[Lauren Conrad]], [[David Cross]], [[Margaret Easley]], Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[André Sogliuzzo]] and [[Crawford Wilson]], along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series.

==Plot==
As [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] finds [[Chris Griffin|Chris]] and his friends watching a [[pornographic film]], she becomes convinced a proper [[sex education|sex-ed]] class should be taught at his school. Since the sex-ed class at her children's school was removed, Lois decides to become the school's newest sex-ed teacher. In class, she attempts to teach students about [[safe sex]], but her efforts are ruined by a botched attempt of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]], who wishes to distribute his views on sex as well. Soon after the first sex-ed class, parental protests arise as Lois taught kids about safe ways to perform [[premarital sex]], rather than [[abstinence]]. As a result, Lois is subsequently fired. She is replaced by a reverend who promotes both premarital and marital abstinence, explaining fictional consequences of intercourse with various questionable examples. The idea appeals to most students, including [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], who starts a relationship with a fellow student named Doug. In a subplot, [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] loses a tooth and is told about the [[tooth fairy]]. Frightened by the fairy tale, Stewie develops a plan to capture the fairy, not knowing she does not exist. He borrows Herbert's false teeth and provokes [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]'s girlfriend Jillian to throw up, as she has [[bulimia nervosa]], in order to collect her teeth as well. Brian, overseeing Stewie's increasing obsession with the fairy, reveals to Stewie that she does not exist, but another scene shows a man named T. Fairy, having an apparent tooth [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]], stealing teeth to roll around in them.

Peter, truly believing the anti-sex propaganda Meg brings home, starts wearing a [[chastity belt]] and refuses to have sex with Lois. In her place, Lois, growing tired of the whole ordeal, convinces Peter to change his mind after raping him. At the same time, Lois catches Meg and Doug engaging in "ear sex" (which has become a fad at the school). Meg explains they did it so that it would not count as sex "in the eyes of the Lord." This prompts Lois and Peter to collaborate into sneaking into the school after being banned. Lois tells the kids that while they should not have sex until they are ready, everyone has urges and it is okay to have premarital sex, but only as long as it is practiced safely and encourages them to use condoms. Following this revelation, Meg's boyfriend breaks up with her after discovering Meg's naked appearance. Humiliated, Meg blames Lois for ruining her relationship and runs away to her room, sobbing. As Peter, Brian, and Lois wrap things up, an announcer tells viewers to text which ending should end the episode: Lois retelling her speech (FAMGUY1), Meg talking about her day (FAMGUY2), or Cleveland giving his line (FAMGUY 3). In the end, the viewers choose FAMGUY 3, and the episode ends with [[Cleveland Brown|Cleveland]] poking out the window and saying the line "Hey Y'all! Sock it to me!".

==Production and censorship==
Many scenes from the original episode were seen as vulgar and were removed from the television broadcast.  One of the scenes removed was from the beginning of the episode when Stewie, Chris, and his friends were watching ''Genital Hospital'', a reference to the television show ''[[General Hospital]]''. The original scene had included the doctor on the film undoing his zipper after discussing the patient's health problems. The edited version cut away before the doctor could undo his zipper, but the sound can still be heard when it cuts back to Chris and his friends watching the porno.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"&gt;{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another scene edited was a naked Peter shown crouched on top of Lois's head (attempting ear sex) (even though it was shown on [[Adult Swim]] every time the episode repeats). On the TV version, Peter is still naked, but it is implied (through sound effects) that Lois forcibly pushed him to the floor and she has a hand on her ear (impling Peter attempted ear sex).&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; In this scene, Peter refers to [[the Grimace]] as [[Ronald McDonald]]'s [[Autism|autistic]] friend, which was originally penned as "retarded friend" (and is included in the uncut version). A scene in which Brian, wearing a robe, informs Lois of the weird-tasting [[Smuckers]] jelly in the fridge leads Peter to reveal that the Smuckers was on his penis was edited on TV so that way he states that the jelly was on his crotch.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; In a scene added later to the episode, [[Mel Gibson]] apologizes to the Jewish community after being offensive while continuing to offend them. The scene was added after the episode had been made but prior to broadcasting. When Peter joins Meg in her quest to be abstinent, the TV version has a gag where Peter keeps mispronouncing the word, Meg corrects him, and Peter punishes her by sending her to her room. The Adult Swim and DVD version replaces that scene with one that was edited for being insensitive to Asian people in which Peter tells Meg that now that he is abstinent, he will be as untouched as the turn signal on an Asian woman's car, followed by a cutaway of an Asian lady causing an accident on an eight-lane highway. In the scene involving Stewie entering [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]'s house, a picture of Chris with the body of a model was in the animatic, but not shown on TV.&lt;ref name="SMith"&gt;{{cite video | people=Smith, Danny|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite video | people=Goodman, David|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original ending of this episode (with the "choose your own ending" text message contest) was supposed to have Lois and Peter throw Brian out the window instead of giving Cleveland his one and only appearance in the episode. This deleted scene is featured in the episode animatic on the season five DVD set.

In addition to the regular cast, actors [[Drew Barrymore]], [[Mindy Cohn]], [[Gary Cole]], [[Taylor Cole]], [[Lauren Conrad]], [[David Cross]], [[Margaret Easley]], Lauren Hooser, Kim Parks, [[Kevin Michael Richardson]], [[André Sogliuzzo]] and [[Crawford Wilson]] guest star in the episode. Recurring guest voices include [[Lori Alan]], [[Alexandra Breckenridge|Alex Breckenridge]], [[Steve Callaghan]], Chris Cox, [[Ralph Garman]], [[Danny Smith (writer)|Danny Smith]], [[Alec Sulkin]], [[John Viener]], and [[Adam West]], who has a role of an exaggerated version of himself.

==Cultural references==
As Lois is informed the sex education classes will be terminated, she exclaims "Oh, no!", a cut-a-way scene then begins of a [[sports car]] driving along the road with music playing in the background, this is a reference to ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.&lt;ref name="Goodman"/&gt; When Stewie is using his toys in order to capture and kill the tooth fairy, the toys are SpongeBob from ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] (from ''[[Transformers (fiction)|The Transformers]]'') and [[Man-E-Faces]], all of which are fictional characters for television programs.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane"/&gt; When Peter is watching television, he is watching ''[[Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County]]''; the women shown on the episode are actually cartoon animations of the real actors for the show.&lt;ref name="Makkos"&gt;{{cite video | people=Makkos, Suzanna|date=2006|title=Family Guy season 5 DVD commentary for the episode "Prick Up Your Ears"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Lois catches Chris and his friends watching a pornographic film, she tells them that without sex education, they can easily become sexually confused.  The scene cuts to [[Michael Jackson]] in his childhood form eating a bowl of [[Frosted Mini-Wheats]], saying that he likes the frosted side, while the grown-up in him likes his younger self. When Lois teaches a sex education class, Peter uses a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of [[William Shakespeare]] and a [[Rainbow Brite]] doll to demonstrate [[sexual intercourse]]. In the scene where Stewie loses a tooth, everybody comes in and tells him to calm down, then it shows a long line of characters, mimicking a scene from the movie ''[[Airplane!]]''. While doing a news story on ear sex, Diane tells Tom that ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' is on Thursdays. When Brian talks about Jillian's [[Bulimia nervosa|bulimia]], he mentions the death of singer [[Karen Carpenter]], who died from anorexia in 1983. When Stewie thinks that Brian is the Tooth Fairy, Brian substantiates his identity by telling Stewie he has a picture of [[Chris Noth]] in his wallet, known for his role on ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''.

==Reception==
In a slight improvement over the previous week, the episode was viewed in 9.3 million homes in its original airing, according to [[Nielsen ratings]]. The episode also acquired a 3.3 rating in the 18–49 demographic, tying with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', while still winning over ''[[American Dad!]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=111406_09 |title=Weekly Program Rankings |publisher=ABC Medianet |date=2006-11-14 |accessdate=2010-05-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221062706/http://abcmedianet.com/web/dnr/dispDNR.aspx?id=111406_09 |archivedate=2009-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the episode received little positive reception, it was given a positive review by ''[[IGN]]''{{'}}s Dan Iverson, who noted that its plot had "great satire of the issue of sex education vs. abstinence".&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/746/746822p1.html|title=Family Guy: "Prick Up Your Ears" Review|work=[[IGN]]|author=Iverson, Dan|accessdate=2007-12-14|date=November 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that "the random flashback jokes are often what are most memorable about each episode".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; He gave the episode a rating of 7.8 out of 10.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; In his review of ''Family Guy'', volume 5, Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk called the episode "a smart jab at the conservative Christian approach to sex education", and stated that "the effect it has on Meg, as well as Peter, is great".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/30387/family-guy-volume-5/|title=Family Guy, Volume 5|work=DVD Talk|author=Rizzo, Francis III|date=September 18, 2007|accessdate=2010-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Material on conveyor during commissioning (7548464136).jpg|thumb|Commissioning of a conveyor where equipment is being tested to its maximum rating and capacity of operation.]]

'''Project commissioning''' is the process of assuring that all systems and components of a [[building]] or [[industrial plant]] are designed, installed, tested, operated, and maintained according to the operational requirements of the owner or final client. A commissioning process may be applied not only to new [[project]]s but also to existing units and systems subject to expansion, [[renovation]] or [[Maintenance, repair, and operations|revamping]].&lt;ref&gt; HORSLEY, D. Process Plant Commissioning, a User Guide, Institution of Chemical Engineering, 1998. &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; FARES, F., MONTENEGRO, B., PRATES, A., ''Commissioning of Oil &amp; Gas Projects – Current Status, Evolution and Trends''. in: Rio Oil &amp; Gas 2010, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, set 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the commissioning process comprises the integrated application of a set of [[engineering]] techniques and procedures to check, inspect and test every operational component of the project, from individual functions, such as [[measurement instrument|instrument]]s and equipment, up to complex amalgamations such as [[Modular design|module]]s, [[subsystem]]s and [[system]]s.

Commissioning activities, in the broader sense, are applicable to all phases of the project, from the basic and detailed [[design]], [[procurement]], [[construction]] and [[manufacturing|assembly]], until the final handover of the unit to the owner, including sometimes an [[assisted operation]] phase.

== Independent discipline ==
Commissioning of large civil and industrial projects is a complex and sophisticated technical specialty which may be considered as a specific and independent  [[:Category:Engineering disciplines|engineering discipline]]. As such, it can be as important as the more traditional ones, i.e. [[civil engineering|civil]], [[naval architecture|naval]], [[chemical engineering|chemical]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[electronic engineering|electronic]], [[instrumentation]], [[automation]], or [[telecommunications engineering|telecom]] engineering. Large projects for which this statement can be made include chemical and petrochemical [[plants]], [[oil platform|oil and gas platforms]] and [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]], metallurgical plants, paper and cellulose plants, coal handling plants, thermoelectric and hydroelectric plants, buildings, bridges, highways, and railroads.

However, there is currently no formal education or university degree which addresses the training or certification of a "Project Commissioning Engineer". Various short training courses and on-line training are available, but they are designed for qualified engineers. Commissioning for buildings is a specific discipline in itself, and there are qualifications available for this.

The International Association of Commissioning Engineers (IACE) was formed in 2015 by a group of Commissioning Professionals, and launched in January 2016. IACE is preparing accredited qualifications to fill the gap in the academic landscape for Commissioning Engineers.

== Objective and impact  ==

The main objective of commissioning is to affect the safe and orderly [[handover]] of the unit from the constructor to the owner, guaranteeing its [[operability]] in terms of [[performance]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], safety and information [[traceability]]. Additionally, when executed in a planned and effective way, commissioning normally represents an essential factor for the fulfillment of schedule, costs, safety and quality requirements of the project. &lt;ref&gt; BENDIKSEN, T., YOUNG, G. [https://books.google.com/books?id=GNOPuByI6eoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Commissioning of Offshore Oil and Gas Projects: The Manager's Handbook], AuthorHouse Publishers, 2005. &lt;/ref&gt;

== Commissioning management systems  ==

For complex projects, the large volume and complexity of commissioning data, together with the need to guarantee adequate information traceability, normally leads to the use of powerful [[Information technology|IT]] tools, known as [[commissioning management systems]], to allow effective planning and monitoring of the commissioning activities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12900">The relationship between '''psychoanalysis and music''' is as old as the history of [[psychoanalysis]] itself. Psychoanalysts have examined musical phenomena, and the relationship has been reciprocal, as also [[musicology|musicologists]] have applied psychoanalysis to their work. [[Music therapy]], too, has utilized psychoanalytic theories.

==History==
[[Sigmund Freud]] discussed shortly some musical phenomena in his book ''[[The Interpretation of Dreams]]'' (1900), but he was more interested in other arts, especially [[literature]] and the [[visual arts]].

Freud’s attitude toward music was ambivalent. Freud described himself as being "ganz unmusikalisch" (totally unmusical).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1936) Letter to M. Bonaparte, 06.12.36. In letters of Sigmund Freud, 1873-1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his much-protested resistance, he could enjoy certain operas such as ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' and ''[[The Marriage of Figaro]]'' and he used musical metaphors in the context of theory and therapy.

[[File:MaxGraf.jpg|thumb|left|170px|The musicologist [[Max Graf]], a pioneer of psychoanalytic study of music.]]
Freud seemed to feel uneasy without a guide from the more rational part. To be emotionally moved by something without knowing what was moving him or why, was an intrinsically anxious experience.&lt;ref&gt;Roazen, P. (1975) Freud and his followers. Harmondsworth: Penguin books, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  The operas he listened were "conversational" and "narrative" forms of music, which is theorized, provided him with some kind of "cognitive control" over the emotional impact of the musical sounds. Cheshire argued that maybe he was jealous and feared the potential therapeutic power of music as a rival to [[psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire, N. M. (1996) The empire of the ear: Freud's problem with music. ''[[International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'', 77, 1127-1168.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was up to other early psychoanalysts than Freud to initiate a serious psychoanalytic study of musical phenomena. First of them was the [[musicology|musicologist]] and critic [[Max Graf]] (1873–1958) who presented his views in the "Wednesday meetings" in 1905–1912. Among other pioneers was Desiderius (Dezső) Mosonyi (1888–1945) who published his writings in Hungarian and in German.

The early views of music were reductive and romantic: the composer expresses him- or herself directly in a musical composition;&lt;ref&gt;Abrams, David M. (1993). Freud and Max Graf: On the Psychoanalysis of Music. — ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music. Second series'' (eds. Stuart Feder &amp; Richard L. Karmel &amp; George H. Pollock), pp. 279–307. International Universities Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt; the reception of music is regressive.&lt;ref&gt;Feder, Stuart — Karmel, Richard L. — Pollock, George H. (1990). Introduction. — ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music'' (eds. Stuart Feder &amp; Richard L. Karmel &amp; George H. Pollock), pp. ix–xvii. International Universities Press, Madison.&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1950, psychoanalytical musicology started to flourish. Within a few years several studies were published by the French [[André Michel (musicologist)|André Michel]] (1951), [[Ernst Kris]] (1952), [[Anton Ehrenzweig]] (1953), [[Theodor Reik]] (1953), and others.

Theodor Reik (1888–1969) was one of Freud’s earliest students. Reik took up the theme of the "haunting melody" in Freud's Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1915–1917) to demonstrate, by contrast to Freud, that musical structure can represent feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In Reik's view, [[melody]] can convey emotion far better than words.

Reik showed that music is the voice of the “unknown itself” that may become compulsive in its attempt to convey a secret message.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Reik speculated that the reason [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] material sometimes emerges as a melody rather than as mere thoughts may be that melody better indicates moods and unknown feelings.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', pp. 17–15.&lt;/ref&gt; He did demonstrate that [[songs]] on the [[mind]] could be effectively interacted with in a psychotherapeutic fashion in a way that helped resolve repressed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Reik, Theodor (1953). ''The haunting melody: Psychoanalytic experiences in life and music'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flow of studies and articles from the latter part of the twentieth century was summarised in the two-volume essay collection ''Psychoanalytic Explorations in Music'' (1990–1993).

==Modes of approach==
From a methodological point of view, there are several approaches visible in the psychoanalytical study of music and psychoanalytically inspired musicology:&lt;ref&gt;Lång, Markus (2004). ''Psykoanalyysi ja sen soveltaminen musiikintutkimukseen'', pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Introspective studies examine one's musically induced experiences and their relations to the unconscious processes.
# Biographical studies examine musicians' and composers' (auto)biographies and descriptions of musical experiences.
# Psychoanalyses of musical patients are discussed.
# Musical experiences are explained with theories of early personal development.
# The elements of [[opera]] (including the hall, staging, plot, the human voice) have been examined.
# Study of [[film music]].
# Analyses of musical compositions, without reference to the personality of the composer.
# In [[music therapy]], how to lift repressions and work them through.
# In cultural studies, the beliefs, conceptions, and habits related to music can be analyzed to reveal unconscious meanings and thought patterns.

== Future: psychoanalysis, neuroscience and music ==
Recent developments in [[cognitive neuroscience of music]] have led to a new way of looking at [[music and emotion]]. Neurologist [[Oliver Sacks]] states that music occupies more areas of the [[brain]] than [[language]] does, and that humans are primarily a musical species.&lt;ref&gt;Sacks, O. (2007). ''Musicophilia, tales of music and the brain'', pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elaborating on this idea, psychoanalyst [[Gilbert Rose]] argues that our responsiveness to music begins with the [[nonverbal]] emotional rapport of the earliest [[infant–parent interplay]].&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004). ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Reaching back even further, since the [[fetus]] has an active auditory system 3–4 months before [[birth]], the [[rhythm]] of the mothers [[womb]] and the sound of her heartbeat could be the start of our responsiveness to music.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004).: ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neuroscientist]] [[Antonio Damasio]] states that when an organism interacts with an object, [[nonverbal]] neural images map the [[organism]], the object and the [[interaction]] between them.&lt;ref&gt;Damasio, A. (1999). ''The feeling of what happens.'' New York: Harcourt Brace.&lt;/ref&gt; As psychoanalysis gives verbal insight of non-verbal emotional involvement, and recent [[neurosciences]] found that music is able to contact this non-verbal emotions, music is stated to help the unison of thinking and feeling.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, G. J. (2004). ''Psychoanalysis, Music, Art and Neuroscience'', pp. xxx–xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The influence of psychoanalysis on music==
Although psychoanalysis has had some influence on [[Psychoanalysis and literature|literature]] and [[Psychoanalytical film theory|cinema]] since the early 20th century, it is more difficult to discern whether musical compositions have been actually inspired or influenced by psychoanalysis.

One candidate has been put up by [[Erik W. Tawaststjerna]]: in his biography of [[Jean Sibelius]], he repeatedly emphasizes the psychological and even psychoanalytical dimensions of Sibelius' [[Symphony No. 4 (Sibelius)|Fourth Symphony]] (1911). According to Tawaststjerna, the Symphony reflects the psychoanalytical and introspective era when Freud and [[Henri Bergson]] stressed the meaning of the unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', pp. 8, 239, 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Even Sibelius himself called his composition "a psychological symphony".&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, the psychiatrist [[Christian Sibelius]] (1869–1922), was one of the first scholars to discuss psychoanalysis in [[Finland]]. According to Tawaststjerna, the Fourth Symphony is "one of the most remarkable documents of the psychoanalytical era."&lt;ref&gt;Tawaststjerna, Erik (1989). ''Jean Sibelius 3'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''self-fulfilling prophecy''' is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true, by the very terms of the prophecy itself, due to [[positive feedback]] between belief and behavior. Although examples of such [[prophecy|prophecies]] can be found in literature as far back as [[ancient Greece]] and [[History of India|ancient India]], it is 20th-century [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] who is credited with coining the expression "self-fulfilling prophecy" and formalizing its structure and consequences. In his 1948 article ''Self-Fulfilling Prophecy'', Merton defines it in the following terms: 
{{quote|The self-fulfilling prophecy is, in the beginning, a ''false'' definition of the situation evoking a new behavior which makes the original false conception come ''true''. This specious validity of the self-fulfilling prophecy perpetuates a reign of error. For the prophet will cite the actual course of events as proof that he was right from the very beginning.&lt;ref name=SFP-48&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In other words, a positive or negative prophecy, strongly held belief, or [[delusion]]—declared as truth when it is actually false—may sufficiently influence people so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy.

Self-fulfilling prophecy are effects in ''[[behavioral confirmation]] effect'', in which behavior, influenced by expectations, causes those expectations to come true.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Darley |first=John M. |first2=Paget H. |last2=Gross |title=Stereotypes and prejudice: essential readings |editor-first=Charles |editor-last=Stangor |year=2000 |publisher= Psychology Press |page=212 |chapter=A Hypothesis-Confirming Bias in Labelling Effects |isbn=978-0-86377-589-5 |oclc=42823720}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is complementary to the [[self-defeating prophecy]].

==History of the concept==
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2014}}
Merton's concept of the ''self-fulfilling prophecy'' stems from the [[Thomas theorem]], which states that "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences".&lt;ref name="thomas"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Child in America: Behavior Problems and Programs |last=Thomas |first=W. I. |authorlink=W. I. Thomas |year=1928 |publisher=Alfred A. Knopf |location=New York |isbn= |pages=572 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas, people react not only to the situations they are in, but also, and often primarily, to the way they perceive the situations and to the meaning they assign to their perceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.thoughtco.com/nominal-interest-rates-and-money-supply-and-demand-1147766|title=How Money Supply and Demand Determine Nominal Interest Rates|work=ThoughtCo|access-date=2017-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Therefore, their behaviour is determined in part by their perception and the meaning they ascribe to the situations they are in, rather than by the situations themselves. Once people convince themselves that a situation really has a certain meaning, regardless of whether it actually does, they will take very real actions in consequence.

Merton took the concept a step further and applied it to recent social phenomena. In his book ''Social Theory and Social Structure'', he conceives of a [[bank run]] at the fictional Last National Bank, over which Cartwright Millingville presides. It is a typical bank, and Millingville has run it honestly and quite properly. As a result, like all banks, it has some [[Asset|liquid assets]] (cash), but most of its assets are invested in various ventures. Then one day, a large number of customers come to the bank at once—the exact reason is never made clear. Customers, seeing so many others at the bank, begin to worry. False rumours spread that something is wrong with the bank, and more customers rush to the bank to try to get some of their money out while they still can. The number of customers at the bank increases, as does their annoyance and excitement, which in turn fuels the false rumours of the bank's [[insolvency]] and upcoming [[bankruptcy]], causing more customers to come and try to withdraw their money. At the beginning of the day—the last one for Millingville's bank—the bank was not insolvent. But the rumour of insolvency caused a sudden demand of withdrawal of too many customers, which could not be answered, causing the bank to become insolvent and declare bankruptcy. Merton concludes this example with the following analysis:

{{quote|The parable tells us that public definitions of a situation (prophecies or predictions) become an integral part of the situation and thus affect subsequent developments. This is peculiar to human affairs. It is not found in the world of nature, untouched by human hands. Predictions of the return of [[Comet Halley|Halley's comet]] do not influence its orbit. But the rumoured insolvency of Millingville's bank did affect the actual outcome. The prophecy of collapse led to its own fulfilment.&lt;ref name="merton"&gt;{{cite book |title= Social Theory and Social Structure|last= Merton|first= Robert K|authorlink= Robert K. Merton|year= 1968|publisher= [[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|location= [[New York City|New York]]|isbn= 978-0-02-921130-4|oclc= 253949|pages= 477}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Merton concluded that the only way to break the cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy is by redefining the propositions on which its false assumptions are originally based.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In economic "expectations models" of inflation, peoples' expectations of future inflation lead them to spend more today and demand higher nominal interest rates for any savings, since they expect that prices will be rising. This demand for higher nominal interest rates and increased spending in the present, in turn, create inflationary pressure and can cause inflation even if the expectations of future inflation are unfounded.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The expectations theory of inflation played a large role in [[Paul Volcker]]'s actions during his tenure as the Chairman of the [[Federal Reserve]] in combating the "[[stagflation]]" of the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] called the self-fulfilling prophecy the ''Oedipus effect'':

{{quote|One of the ideas I had discussed in ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' was the influence of a prediction upon the event predicted. I had called this the "Oedipus effect", because the oracle played a most important role in the sequence of events which led to the fulfilment of its prophecy. … For a time I thought that the existence of the Oedipus effect distinguished the social from the natural sciences. But in biology, too—even in molecular biology—expectations often play a role in bringing about what has been expected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography |last=Popper |first=Karl |authorlink=Karl Popper |year=1976 |publisher=Open Court |location=LaSalle, Illinois |isbn=978-0-87548-343-6 |oclc=2927208 |pages= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An early precursor of the concept appears in [[Edward Gibbon]]'s ''[[Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'': "During many ages, the prediction, as it is usual, contributed to its own accomplishment" (chapter I, part II).

===Applications===
Examples abound{{examples|date=May 2014}} in studies of [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] and the related [[self-perception theory]]; people will often change their [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]] to come into line with what they profess publicly.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco-Villanueva, M. A., [http://revistasinvestigacion.unmsm.edu.pe/index.php/econo/article/view/14336 El Efecto “Pricebo”: Cómo los precios pueden influenciar la percepción sobre la calidad del cannabis y sus implicaciones en las políticas de precios"], ''Pensamiento Crítico,'' vol. 22, n. 2, pp 175-210&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In the United States, the concept was broadly and consistently applied in the field of public education reform, following the "[[War on Poverty]]". Theodore Brameld noted: "In simplest terms, education already projects and thereby reinforces whatever habits of personal and cultural life are considered to be acceptable and dominant."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brameld |first=T. |authorlink= |year=1972 |title=Education as self-fulfilling prophecy |journal=Phi Beta Kappa |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=8–11, 58–61 [p. 9]|url= |quote= }} Quoted by Wilkins (1976), p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of teacher attitudes, beliefs and values, affecting their expectations have been tested repeatedly.&lt;ref name="Wilkins1976"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wilkins |first=William E. |authorlink= |year=1976 |title=The Concept of a Self-Fulfilling Prophecy |journal=Sociology of Education |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=175–183 |issn=0038-0407|quote= |doi=10.2307/2112523 |jstor= 2112523 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phenomenon of the "inevitability of war" is a self-fulfilling prophecy that has received considerable study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=The role of expectancy |title=The Tensions That Cause Wars |last=Allport |first=G. |authorlink= |editor=Cantrill, H. |year=1950 |publisher=University of Illinois |location=Urbana |isbn= |pages=43–78 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea is similar to that discussed by the philosopher [[William James]] as "[[The Will to Believe]]." But James viewed it positively, as the self-validation of a belief.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Just as, in Merton's example, the belief that a bank is insolvent may help create the fact, so too, on the positive side, confidence in the bank's prospects may help brighten them.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Similarly, Stock-exchange panic episodes, and speculative bubble episodes, can be triggered with the belief that the stock will go down (or up), thus starting the selling/buying mass move, etc.

A more Jamesian example: a swain, convinced that the fair maiden ''must'' love him, may prove more effective in his wooing than he would had his initial prophecy been defeatist.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is extensive evidence{{where|date=May 2014}} of "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", where the seemingly private expectations of individuals can predict the outcome of the world around them. The mechanisms by which this occurs are also reasonably well understood: it is simply that our own expectations change our behaviour in ways we may not notice and correct. In the case of the "Interpersonal Expectation Effects", others pick up on non-verbal behaviour, which affects their attitudes. A famous{{according to whom|date=May 2014}} example includes a study where teachers were told arbitrarily that random students were "going to blossom".{{Failed verification|date=May 2014}}  Oddly, those random students actually ended the year with significantly greater improvements.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal-2003&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenthal |first=Robert |year=2003 |title=Covert communication in laboratories, classrooms, and the truly real world |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |publisher=Blackwell |volume=12 |issue=5 |pages=151–154 |doi= 10.1111/1467-8721.t01-1-01250|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~schaller/Psyc591Readings/Rosenthal2003.pdf |accessdate=4 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Pygmalion in the Classroom|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Robert|last2=Jacobson|first2=Lenore|year=2003|publisher=Crown House|isbn=9781904424062}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
In Canadian ice hockey, junior league players are selected based on skill, motor coordination, physical maturity, and other individual merit criteria. However, psychologist Robert Barnsley showed that in any elite group of hockey players, 40% are born between January and March, versus the approximately 25% as would be predicted by statistics. The explanation is that in Canada, the eligibility cutoff for age-class hockey is January 1, and the players who are born in the first months of the year are older by 0–11 months, which at the preadolescent age of selection (nine or ten) manifests into an important physical advantage. The selected players are exposed to higher levels of coaching, play more games, and have better teammates. These factors make them actually become the best players, fulfilling the prophecy, while the real selection criterion was age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gladwell|first=Malcolm|title=[[Outliers (book)|Outliers]]|year=2008|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]|isbn=978-0-316-01792-3|pages=20–25|chapter=1 – The Matthew Effect|laysummary=http://www.rugbyiq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1199:is-it-because-of-talent-that-athletes-succeed&amp;catid=102:mental-toughness&amp;Itemid=458}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The same [[relative age effect]] has been noticed in Belgian soccer after 1997, when the start of the selection year was changed from August 1 to January 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Helsen|first=WF |author2=Starkes, JL |author3=Van Winckel, J|title=Effect of a change in selection year on success in male soccer players|journal=American Journal of Human Biology|date=2000-11-01|volume=12|issue=6|pages=729–735|pmid=11534065|doi=10.1002/1520-6300(200011/12)12:6&lt;729::AID-AJHB2&gt;3.0.CO;2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stereotype==
{{Main|Stereotype threat}}
This specific form of self-fulfilling prophecy is very common and takes many forms. For example, the expectancy for a political party to act in a certain way—based on [[Internalized racism|race]], religion, gender and much more—can eventually lead the said party to imitate the stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, N. R. (19992000). Personality. Psychology: the science of behaviour (Canandian ed., p. 492). Scarborough, Ont.: Allyn and Bacon Canada.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literature, media, and the arts==
In literature, self-fulfilling prophecies are often used as [[plot device]]s. They have been used in stories for millennia, but have gained a lot of popularity recently in the [[science fiction]] genre. They are typically used ironically, with the prophesied events coming to pass due to the actions of one trying to prevent the prophecy (a recent example would be the life of [[Anakin Skywalker]], the fictional Jedi-turned-Sith Lord in [[George Lucas]]' [[Star Wars (franchise)|''Star Wars'' saga]]). They are also sometimes used as comic relief.

===Classical===
Many myths, legends and fairy tales make use of this motif as a central element of narratives that are designed to illustrate [[Destiny|inexorable fate]], fundamental to the Hellenic world-view.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Moirai]], [[Erinyes]]. "Very often the bases for false definitions and consequent self-fulfilling prophecies are deeply rooted in the individual or group norms and are subsequently difficult to change". (Wilkins 1976:177).&lt;/ref&gt; In a common motif, a child, whether newborn or not yet conceived, is prophesied to cause something that those in power do not want to happen. This may be the death of the powerful person; in more light-hearted versions, it is often the marriage of a poor or lower-class child to his own.&lt;!--own what?--&gt; The events come about, nevertheless, as a result of the actions taken to prevent them: frequently [[Child abandonment#Child abandonment in literature|child abandonment]] sets the chain of events in motion.

====Greek====
[[File:Oedipe enfant.JPG|thumb|[[Oedipus]] in the arms of [[Phorbas]].]]
The best known example from Greek legend is that of [[Oedipus]]. Warned that his child would one day kill him, [[Laius]] abandoned his newborn son Oedipus to die, but Oedipus was found and raised by others, and thus in ignorance of his true origins. When he grew up, Oedipus was warned that he would kill his father and marry his mother. Believing his foster parents were his real parents, he left his home and travelled to Greece, eventually reaching the city where his biological parents lived. There, he got into a fight with a stranger, his real father, killed him and married his widow, Oedipus' real mother.

Although the legend of [[Perseus]] opens with the prophecy that he will kill his grandfather [[Acrisius]], and his abandonment with his mother [[Danaë]], the prophecy is only self-fulfilling in some variants. In some, he accidentally spears his grandfather at a competition—an act that could have happened regardless of [[Acrisius]]' response to the prophecy. In other variants, his presence at the games is explained by his hearing of the prophecy, so that his attempt to evade it does cause the prophecy to be fulfilled. In still others, [[Acrisius]] is one of the wedding guests when [[Polydectes]] tried to force Danaë to marry him, and when [[Perseus]] turns them to stone with the [[Medusa|Gorgon]]'s head; as Polydectes fell in love with Danaë because Acrisius abandoned her at sea, and Perseus killed the Gorgon as a consequence of Polydectes' attempt to get rid of Danaë's son so that he could marry her, the prophecy fulfilled itself in these variants.

Greek historiography provides a famous variant: when the Lydian king [[Croesus]] asked the [[Delphic Oracle]] if he should invade Persia, the response came that if he did, he would destroy a great kingdom. Assuming this meant he would succeed, he attacked—but the kingdom he destroyed was his own.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus ''Histories'' 1.88&lt;/ref&gt; In such an example, the prophecy prompts someone to action because he is led to expect a favorable result; but he achieves another, disastrous result which nonetheless fulfills the prophecy.

People do not necessarily have to unsuccessfully avoid a prophecy in order for the prophecy to be self-fulfilling. For example, when it was predicted that [[Zeus]] would overthrow his father, [[Cronus|Cronos]], and usurp his throne as King of the Gods, he actively waged war against him in a direct attempt to fulfill this prophecy. This makes the prophecy a self-fulfilling one because it was the prophecy itself that gave Zeus the inspiration to do it in the first place.

====Roman====
[[File:Lupa romana.jpeg|right|thumb|[[Romulus and Remus]] feeding from a wolf.]]
The story of [[Romulus and Remus]] is another example. According to legend, a man overthrew his brother, the king. He then ordered that his two nephews, Romulus and Remus, be drowned, fearing that they would someday kill him like he did to his brother. The boys were placed in a basket and thrown in the [[Tiber River]]. A wolf found the babies and she raised them. Later, a shepherd found the twins and named them Romulus and Remus. As teenagers, they found out who they were. They killed their uncle, fulfilling the prophecy.

====Persian====
Another example of a self-fulfilling prophecy is detailed by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in his account of [[Cyrus the Great]]'s life. In this account, Astyages had two prophetic dreams. Both dreams involved something particular (in the first dream, a flood, while in the second dream, a fruit bearing vine) emerging from his daughter Mandane's pelvis and covering the entirety of Asia. After consulting the Magi, he was informed that the dreams
foreshadowed the birth of a child who would eventually rule in his place. Terrified by the prophecies, Astyages summoned [[Harpagus]] and commanded him to kill the child after it's born. Harpagus, however, was reluctant to kill the child and so assigned the task to one of Astyages' cowherds. The cowherd likewise hesitated and so he and his wife devised a plan to expose their own child, that was born dead, to a desolate place in the mountains while raising the other child as their own. The child was afterwards named Cyrus. One day, when Cyrus was 10 years old, an incident with one of the children he was playing with brought him before king Astyages to give account for his actions. While listening to Cyrus' words, Astyages became suspicious that Cyrus could be the child he wanted to kill. After pressuring his cowherd to relay to him everything about the child, the cowherd finally revealed everything about how he happened upon the child and how he decided to raise him as his own. Astyages, angered with Harpagus summoned him as well and Harpagus likewise revealed the truth. In revenge, the king killed Harpagus' son and later made this act known to Harpagus. However, he spared Cyrus' life as the magi, attempting to further clarify the prophecy to him, accidentally misinterpreted it and thus saved Cyrus. After some time Harpagus, possibly driven by revenge, took advantage of Cyrus' prosperous growth and Astyages' misdeeds to persuade him to revolt against Astyages. His efforts eventually proved successful as Cyrus became king and Astyages was imprisoned. {{sfn|Herodotus|p=1.107-130}}

====Arabic====
A variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy is the self-fulfilling dream, which dates back to medieval [[Arabic literature]]. Several tales in the ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'', also known as the ''Arabian Nights'', use this device to [[Foreshadowing|foreshadow]] what is going to happen, as a special form of literary [[Flashforward|prolepsis]]. A notable example is "[[The Ruined Man Who Became Rich Again Through a Dream]]", in which a man is told in his dream to leave his native city of [[Baghdad]] and travel to [[Cairo]], where he will discover the whereabouts of some hidden treasure. The man travels there and experiences misfortune after losing belief in the prophecy, ending up in jail, where he tells his dream to a police officer. The officer mocks the idea of foreboding dreams and tells the protagonist that he himself had a dream about a house with a courtyard and fountain in Baghdad where treasure is buried under the fountain. The man recognizes the place as his own house and, after he is released from jail, he returns home and digs up the treasure. In other words, the foreboding dream not only predicted the future, but the dream was the cause of its prediction coming true. A variant of this story later appears in [[English folklore]] as the "[[Pedlar of Swaffham]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=[[I.B. Tauris|Tauris Parke Paperbacks]]|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|pages=193–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the self-fulfilling prophecy can be seen in "[[The Tale of Attaf]]", where [[Harun al-Rashid]] consults his library (the [[House of Wisdom]]), reads a random book, "falls to laughing and weeping and dismisses the faithful ''[[vizier]]''" [[Ja'far ibn Yahya]] from sight. Ja'far, "disturbed and upset flees Baghdad and plunges into a series of adventures in [[Damascus]], involving Attaf and the woman whom Attaf eventually marries." After returning to Baghdad, Ja'far reads the same book that caused Harun to laugh and weep, and discovers that it describes his own adventures with Attaf. In other words, it was Harun's reading of the book that provoked the adventures described in the book to take place. This is an early example of [[Retrocausality|reverse causality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights: A Companion|first=Robert|last=Irwin|publisher=Tauris Parke Paperbacks|year=2003|isbn=1-86064-983-1|page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 12th century, this tale was [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by [[Petrus Alphonsi]] and included in his ''Disciplina Clericalis''. In the 14th century, a version of this tale also appears in the ''[[Gesta Romanorum]]'' and [[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''[[The Decameron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Arabian Nights Encyclopedia|last=Ulrich Marzolph, Richard van Leeuwen|first=Hassan Wassouf|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2004|isbn=1-57607-204-5|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hinduism====
[[File:Radhakrishna manor.JPG|thumb|right|[[Krishna]] playing his flute with [[Radha]].]]
Self-fulfilling prophecies appear in classical [[Sanskrit literature]]. In the story of [[Krishna]] in the [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epic]] ''[[Mahabharata]]'', the ruler of the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Mathura]] kingdom, [[Kamsa|Kansa]], afraid of a prophecy that predicted his death at the hands of his sister [[Devaki]]'s son, had her cast into prison where he planned to kill all of her children at birth. After killing the first six children, and Devaki's apparent miscarriage of the seventh, Krishna (the eighth son) was born. As his life was in danger he was smuggled out to be raised by his foster parents [[Yashoda]] and [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]] in the village of [[Gokula]]. Years later, Kansa learned about the child's escape and kept sending various demons to put an end to him. The demons were defeated at the hands of Krishna and his brother [[Balarama]]. Krishna, as a young man returned to Mathura to overthrow his uncle, and Kansa was eventually killed by his nephew Krishna. It was due to Kansa's attempts to prevent the prophecy that led to it coming true, thus fulfilling the prophecy.

====Russian====
[[Oleg of Novgorod]] was a [[Varangian]] prince who ruled over the [[Rus (people)|Rus people]] during the early tenth century. As old [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]] chronicles say, it was prophesied by the pagan priests that Oleg's stallion would be the source of Oleg's death. To avoid this he sent the horse away. Many years later he asked where his horse was, and was told it had died. He asked to see the remains and was taken to the place where the bones lay. When he touched the horse's skull with his boot a snake slithered from the skull and bit him. Oleg died, thus fulfilling the prophecy. In the [[Primary Chronicle]], Oleg is known as the Prophet, ironically referring to the circumstances of his death. The story was romanticized by [[Alexander Pushkin]] in his celebrated ballad "The Song of the Wise Oleg". In Scandinavian traditions, this legend lived on in the saga of [[Orvar-Odd]].

====European fairy tales====
Many fairy tales, such as ''[[The Devil With the Three Golden Hairs]]'', ''[[The Fish and the Ring]]'', ''[[The Story of Three Wonderful Beggars]]'', or ''[[The King Who Would Be Stronger Than Fate]]'', revolve about a prophecy that a poor boy will marry a rich girl (or, less frequently, a poor girl a rich boy).&lt;ref&gt;Stith Thompson, ''The Folktale'', p 139, University of California Press, Berkeley Los Angeles London, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; This is story type 930 in the [[Aarne–Thompson classification system|Aarne–Thompson]] classification scheme. The girl's father's efforts to prevent it are the reason why the boy ends up marrying her.

Another fairy tale occurs with older children. In ''[[The Language of the Birds]]'', a father forces his son to tell him what the birds say: that the father would be the son's servant. In ''[[The Ram (fairy tale)|The Ram]]'', the father forces his daughter to tell him her dream: that her father would hold an ewer for her to wash her hands in. In all such tales, the father takes the child's response as evidence of ill-will and drives the child off; this allows the child to change so that the father will not recognize his own offspring later and so offer to act as the child's servant.

In some variants of ''[[Sleeping Beauty]]'', such as ''[[Sun, Moon, and Talia]]'', the sleep is not brought about by a curse, but a prophecy that she will be endangered by flax (or hemp) results in the royal order to remove all the flax or hemp from the castle, resulting in her ignorance of the danger and her curiosity.

====Shakespeare====
[[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Macbeth]]'' is another classic example of a self-fulfilling prophecy. The three witches give Macbeth a prophecy that Macbeth will eventually become king, but afterwards, the offspring of his best friend will rule instead of his own. Macbeth tries to make the first half true while trying to keep his bloodline on the throne instead of his friend's. Spurred by the prophecy, he kills the king and his friend, something he, arguably, never would have done before. In the end, the evil actions he committed to avoid his succession by another's bloodline get him killed in a revolution.

The later prophecy by the first apparition of the witches that Macbeth should "Beware Macduff" is also a self-fulfilling prophecy. If Macbeth had not been told this, then he might not have regarded Macduff as a threat. Therefore, he would not have killed Macduff's family, and Macduff would not have sought revenge and killed Macbeth.

===Modern===
Similar to Oedipus above, a more modern example would be [[Darth Vader]] in the ''Star Wars'' films, or [[Lord Voldemort]] in the [[Harry Potter (franchise)|Harry Potter]] franchise and the Big Three in [[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]] - each attempted to take steps to prevent action against them which had been predicted could cause their downfall, but instead ''created'' the conditions leading to it. Another, less well-known, modern example occurred with the character John Mitchell on [[BBC Three]]'s ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]''. The Disney television series ''[[That's So Raven]]'' stars [[Raven-Symoné]] as the title character with the ability to see into the future with a strange situation. The extreme steps that the character takes to prevent the situation are almost always what lead to it.

====New Thought====
The [[law of attraction (New Thought)|law of attraction]] is a typical example of self-fulfilling prophecy. It is the name given to the belief that "like attracts like" and that by focusing on positive or negative thoughts, one can bring about positive or negative results.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;Whittaker, S. [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 Secret attraction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090328/http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/story.html?id=78fc94dd-c0b2-4ade-891d-98770bfae388&amp;k=70777 |date=2016-03-04 }}, ''The Montreal Gazette'', May 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Redden, Guy, ''Magic Happens: A New Age Metaphysical Mystery Tour'', Journal of Australian Studies: 101&lt;/ref&gt; According to this law, all things are created first by imagination, which leads to thoughts, then to words and actions. The thoughts, words and actions held in mind affect someone's intentions which makes the expected result happen. Although there are some cases where positive or negative attitudes can produce corresponding results (principally the [[placebo]] and [[nocebo]] effects), there is no scientific basis to the law of attraction.&lt;ref name="skepdic"&gt;{{cite web

==Causal loop==
{{see also|Causal loop|Newcomb's paradox}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy may be a form of causality loop, only when the prophecy can be said to be ''truly'' known to occur, since only then events in the future will be causing effects in the past. Otherwise, it would be a simple case of events in the past causing events in the future. [[Predestination]] does not necessarily involve a [[supernatural]] power, and could be the result of other "infallible foreknowledge" mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv|last=Craig|first=William Lane|year=1987 |url=http://www.leaderu.com/offices/billcraig/docs/newcomb.html |title=Divine Foreknowledge and Newcomb's Paradox |journal=Philosophia |volume=17 |issue=3 |pages=331–350 |doi=10.1007/BF02455055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems arising from infallibility and influencing the future are explored in [[Newcomb's paradox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Dummett|first=Michael|title=The Seas of Language|isbn13=9780198240112|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pp=356, 370–375}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable fictional example of a self-fulfilling prophecy occurs in classical play ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which [[Oedipus]] becomes the king of [[Thebes, Greece|Thebes]], whilst in the process unwittingly fulfills a prophecy that he would kill his father and marry his mother. The prophecy itself serves as the impetus for his actions, and thus it is self-fulfilling.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Dodds|first=E.R.|year=1966|title=Greece &amp; Rome}} 2nd Ser., Vol. 13, No. 1, 37–49&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]'' heavily deals with themes of predestination and the [[Cassandra (metaphor)|Cassandra complex]], where the protagonist who travels back in time explains that he cannot change the past.&lt;ref name="Klosterman"&gt;{{cite book |ref=harv|last1=Klosterman |first1=Chuck |title=Eating the Dinosaur |date=2009 |publisher=Scribner |location=New York |isbn=9781439168486|edition=1st Scribner hardcover|pp=60–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:2013_Fertility_per_woman_world_map.jpg|thumb|Total fertility rate as of 2013]]
'''Sub-replacement fertility''' is a [[total fertility rate]] (TFR) that (if sustained) leads to each new [[generation]] being less populous than the older, previous one in a given area.  In [[developed countries]] sub-replacement fertility is any rate below approximately 2.1 children born per woman, but the threshold can be as high as 3.4 in some developing countries because of higher [[mortality rate]]s.&lt;ref name= variation&gt;{{cite journal |title=The surprising global variation in replacement fertility |vauthors=Espenshade TJ, Guzman JC, Westoff CF |year=2003 |journal=Population Research and Policy Review |volume=22 |pages=575–583 |doi=10.1023/B:POPU.0000020882.29684.8e |issue=5/6}}, Introduction and Table 1, p. 580&lt;/ref&gt; Taken globally, the total fertility rate at replacement was 2.33 children per woman in 2003.&lt;ref name=variation/&gt;  This can be "translated" as 2 children per woman to replace the parents, plus a "third of a child" to make up for the [[Human sex ratio|higher probability of boys]] born and mortality prior to the end of their fertile life.{{efn|1=For example, in the United Kingdom in 2001, 304,635 boys were born as opposed to 289,999 girls, and some of these girls do not survive to the end of their child-bearing years.

Replacement level fertility in terms of the [[net reproduction rate]] (NRR) is exactly one, because the NRR takes both mortality rates and sex ratios at birth into account.

As of 2010, about 48% (3.3 billion people) of the world population lives in nations with sub-replacement fertility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121028012124/http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Analytical-Figures/htm/fig_8.htm "Figure 8: Population by Total Fertility (millions)"] in ''World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision''. United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless most of these countries still have growing populations due to [[immigration]], [[population momentum]] and increase of the [[life expectancy]]. This includes most nations of [[Europe]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], [[Russia]], [[Iran]], [[Tunisia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], the [[United States]] and many others. In 2015, all [[European Union]] countries had a sub-replacement fertility rate, ranging from a low of 1.31 in [[Portugal]] to a high of 1.96 in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tsdde220&amp;plugin=0 {{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The countries or areas that have the lowest fertility are in developed parts of East and Southeast Asia: [[Singapore]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]] and [[South Korea]].&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2127rank.html |title=Country Comparison :: Total Fertility Rate |website=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a few countries have had, for the time being, sufficiently sustained sub-replacement fertility (sometimes combined with other population factors like higher [[emigration]] than [[immigration]]) to have [[population decline]], such as [[Aging of Japan|Japan]], [[Demographics of Germany|Germany]], [[Lithuania]], and [[Ukraine]]. As of 2016, the total fertility rate varied from 0.82 in [[Singapore]] to 6.62 in [[Niger]].&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;

There have been a number of explanations for the general decline in fertility rates in much of the world, and the true explanation is almost certainly a combination of different factors.

===Higher education===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1984-0807-017, Leipzig, Familienszene.jpg|thumb|left|Woman and her husband, both medical students, and their triplets in the [[East Germany]] (GDR) in 1984. Some countries have had state policies to encourage births among educated women.]]
The fact that more people are going to colleges and universities, and are working to obtain more post-graduate degrees there, along with the soaring costs of education, have contributed greatly to postponing marriage in many cases, and bearing children at all, or fewer numbers of children. And the fact that the number of women getting higher education has increased has contributed to fewer of them getting married younger, if at all. In the US, for example, females make up more than half of all college students, which is a reversal from a few decades back.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/97facts/edu2birt.htm Mother's Educational Level Influences Birth Rate]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between higher education and childbearing varies by country: for example, in Switzerland by age 40, childlessness among women who had completed [[tertiary education]] is 40%, while in  France it is only 15%.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"&gt;http://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2_5_Childlessness_June2014.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In some countries, childlessness has a longer tradition, and was common even before educational levels increased, but in others, such as [[Southern European]] ones, it is a recent phenomenon; for instance in Spain the childlessness rate for women aged 40–44 in 2011 was 21.60%,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oecd.org/els/family/SF_2-5-Childlessness.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; but historically throughout the 20th century it was around 10%.&lt;ref name="oecd.org"/&gt; Not all countries show a relationship between low fertility and education: in [[Czech Republic]], of women born in 1961-1965, low educated women were more likely to be childless than high educated women.&lt;ref&gt;http://demografia.hu/hu/letoltes/publikaciok/EPCposter2016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Economic fluctuation===
{{Further|Income and fertility}}
The growth of [[gross domestic product|wealth]] and [[Human Development Index|human development]] are related to sub-replacement fertility, although a sudden drop in living conditions, such as the [[great depression]], can also lower fertility.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prb.org/publications/datasheets/2012/world-population-data-sheet/fact-sheet-us-population.aspx{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Eastern European countries, the fall of communism was followed by an economic collapse in many of these countries in the 1990s. Some countries, such as those that experienced violent conflicts in the 1990s, were badly affected. Large numbers of people lost their jobs, and massive unemployment, lack of jobs outside the big cities, and economic uncertainty discourages people from having children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1007/s12546-014-9141-5|title = Population ageing and low fertility: Recent demographic changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina|journal = Journal of Population Research|volume = 32|pages = 23–43|year = 2015|last1 = Pobric|first1 = Alma|last2 = Robinson|first2 = Guy M}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]], the total fertility rate in 2016 was only 1.28 children born/woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bk.html |title=Europe :: Bosnia and Herzegovina |website=The World Factbook |publisher=Central Intelligence Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Urbanization===
[[File:Merlion_Closeup.JPG|thumb|right|[[Singapore]], a [[city state]], has the lowest TFR in the world in 2016&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt;]]
Some consider the increase of [[urbanization]] around the world a central cause.  In recent times, residents of urban areas tend to have fewer children than people in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ueki T | title = [Analysis of factors related to the recent decline in birth rate in Japan] | journal = [Nihon Koshu Eisei Zasshi] Japanese Journal of Public Health | volume = 42 | issue = 2 | pages = 121–8 | date = February 1995 | pmid = 7718907 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Khan HT, Raeside R | title = Factors affecting the most recent fertility rates in urban-rural Bangladesh | journal = Social Science &amp; Medicine | volume = 44 | issue = 3 | pages = 279–89 | date = February 1997 | pmid = 9004364 | doi = 10.1016/s0277-9536(96)00076-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need for extra labour from children on farms does not apply to urban-dwellers. Cities tend to have higher property prices, making a large family more expensive, especially in those societies where each child is now expected to have their own bedroom, rather than sharing with siblings as was the case until recently. Rural areas also tend to be more conservative, with less [[contraception]] and [[abortion]] than urban areas.

===Reduction of child labour===
[[File:Diamond_miners-1-.jpg|thumb|200px|left|[[Child labor]] is common in many parts of the world]]
Countries which have a high fertility rate are usually less developed countries, where families rely on children to help them, with labour such as [[agricultural]] work, tending to livestock, or even paid work. In such countries [[child labour]] is quite common, with children bringing money at home, or actively supporting the family through pshysical work. By contrast, in the West,  child labour is banned, and it is parents who invest very high costs into their children.&lt;ref&gt;https://tad.colman.ac.il/paper-all/9868.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views on the "ideal" family===
Although fertility rates are often discussed in terms of state policies (e.g. financial benefits, combining work with family etc.), the deeply entranced social views on what constitutes an "ideal" family may play a crucial role: if parents do not envision large families in a positive way, it is difficult to "convince" them to have many children. In this regard, there are major differences between European countries: while 50.23% of women aged 15–39 state that the "ideal" family has 3 or more children in [[Estonia]], and 46.43% say this in [[Finland]]; only 11.3% say this in [[Czech Republic]], and 11.39% in [[Bulgaria]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oecd.org/social/family/database.htm{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contraception===
Changes in [[contraception]] are also an important cause, and one that has seen dramatic changes in the last few generations. Legalization and widespread acceptance of contraception in the developed world is a large factor in decreased fertility levels; however, for instance in a European context where its prevalence has always been very high in the modern era, the fertility rates do not seem to be influenced significantly by availability of contraception.&lt;ref name=Capri&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors =  | title = Europe the continent with the lowest fertility | journal = Human Reproduction Update | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 590–602 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20603286 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1093/humupd/dmq023 | author1 = ESHRE Capri Workshop Group }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assisted reproductive technology===

The availability of [[assisted reproductive technology]] (ART) may foster delay of childbearing, because many couples think that it can solve any future fertility problems.&lt;ref name=Capri/&gt; Its effect on total fertility rate is extremely small but government support for it is beneficial for families.&lt;ref name=Capri/&gt;

===Human Development Index===
[[File:2014_UN_Human_Development_Report_Quartiles.svg|thumb|[[Human Development Index]] map. Darker is higher.]]
The [[Human Development Index]] (HDI) is a composite statistic of [[life expectancy]], [[education]], and [[per capita income]] indicators, which are used to rank countries into four tiers of [[Human development (humanity)|human development]]. A country scores higher HDI when the [[life expectancy at birth|lifespan]] is higher, the [[education]] level is higher, and the [[GDP per capita]] is higher. There is a strong inverse correlation between the HDI and the fertility rate of the population: the higher the HDI, the lower the fertility rate. As of 2016, the countries with the highest fertility rate are Burundi, Mali, Somalia, Uganda, Burkina Faso, Zambia, Malawi, Angola, and Afghanistan; while most Western countries have sub-replacement fertility rates.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; This is part of the [[Income and fertility|fertility-income paradox]], as these high fertility countries are very poor, and it may seem counter-intuitive for families there to have so many children. The inverse relationship between income and fertility has been termed a ''demographic-economic "[[paradox]]"'' by the notion that greater means would enable the production of more offspring as suggested by the influential [[Thomas Malthus]].

===Government policies===

Some governments have launched programmes to reduce fertility rates and curb population growth. Notably, China implemented a [[one-child policy]] for 35 years (from 1979 to 2015); this was relaxed to a [[two-child policy]] in 2016.

Although today Singapore has a very low fertility rate, and the government encourages parents to have more children because birth rates have fallen below the replacement rate, in the 1970s the situation was the opposite: the government wished to slow and reverse the boom in births that started after [[World War II]] (see the poster).

===Ability to choose===
The total fertility rate is also influenced by the ability to choose what type of family to have, if and when to have children, and the number of children to have - free from coercion, pressure, or interference from the community, extended family, state or church. This includes prohibition on practices such as [[child marriage]], [[forced marriage]] or [[bride price]]. In some cultures for instance, the payment of the bride price creates an obligation on the wife to have children, and failure to do so often results in threats and violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bawah | first1 = Ayaga Agula | last2 = Akweongo | first2 = Patricia | last3 = Simmons | first3 = Ruth | last4 = Phillips | first4 = James F. | title = Women's fears and men's anxieties: the impact of family planning on gender relations in Northern Ghana | journal = [[Studies in Family Planning]] | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 54–66 | date = 1999 | url = https://www.popcouncil.org/research/womens-fears-and-mens-anxieties-the-impact-of-family-planning-on-gender-rel | ref = harv }} [http://www.popcouncil.org/uploads/pdfs/councilarticles/sfp/SFP301Bawah.pdf PDF.]&lt;/ref&gt; Western countries have substantially lower fertility rates, and increased [[childlessness]], because people who remain childless or who have small families are less likely to be stigmatized. In many cultures childless women suffer discrimination, stigma, ostracism, and social isolation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = WHO | author-link = World Health Organization | title = Mother or nothing: the agony of infertility | journal = [[Bulletin of the World Health Organization]] | volume = 88 | issue = 12 | pages = 877&amp;ndash;953 | date = December 2010 | url = http://www.who.int/bulletin/volumes/88/12/10-011210/en/ | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== War ===
It has been shown, both historically and in the present day, that societies engaged in a prolonged state of war experience a substantial lag in fertility rate. The most notable examples of this phenomenon are widely accredited to the First and Second World Wars. Modeled by these examples, "total war" subjects individuals to intense social upheavals and a heavy psychological impact that forcefully prioritizes survival and economic stability over the need to reproduce for the duration of the conflict. Events like these subsequently pave way &lt;ref&gt;Haupt, A., Kane, T. T., &amp; Haub, C. (2011). PRB's population handbook. ''Population reference bureau'' (sixth edition).&lt;/ref&gt; for an active effort to repopulate, such as the "baby boom" after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Demographic Transition Theory|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_54JBLG7V1QC|publisher = Springer Science &amp; Business Media|date = 2007-09-21|isbn = 9781402044984|language = en|first = John C.|last = Caldwell}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--- ===Malthusian===
Another school of thought{{who|date=January 2011}} argues that all these factors are a natural outgrowth of a [[Malthusian]] attempt to restore a population balance that was upset earlier.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}  The revolution in [[hygiene]] and [[medicine]] that caused [[death rate]]s to plummet during the twentieth century did not see a corresponding fall in [[birth rate]]s until a couple of generations later.  This period of low death rates and high birth rates thus caused human population to balloon at a rate never before seen in human history on such a wide scale.  The Malthusians argue that modern low birth rates are a natural reaction to counteract this imbalance.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}---&gt;

===Tempo effect===
[[File:Tokyo_night_view_1.jpg|thumb|[[Japan]], a highly developed country, is struggling with low fertility rates and [[aging in Japan]]]]
Total fertility rate (TFR) is affected by a phenomenon called the tempo effect, which describes "distortions due to changes in the timing of births." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Population Change in Europe, the Middle-East and North Africa: Beyond the Demographic Divide|last=Matthijs|first=Koenraad|last2=Neels|first2=Karel|last3=Timmerman|first3=Christiane|last4=Haers|first4=Jaques|publisher=Routledge|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Bongaarts]] and Griffith Feeney have suggested that this tempo effect is driving the decline of measured fertility rate in the developed world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/j.1728-4457.2002.00419.x| title = The End of the Fertility Transition in the Developed World| journal = Population and Development Review| volume = 28| issue = 3| pages = 419–443| year = 2002| last1 = Bongaarts | first1 = J. | author-link1 = John Bongaarts| citeseerx = 10.1.1.533.4803}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type of partnership===
A study of the United States and multiple countries in Europe came to the result that women who continue to [[cohabit]] rather than get married after birth have significantly lower probability of having a second child than married women in all countries except those in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Perelli-Harris B | title = How Similar are Cohabiting and Married Parents? Second Conception Risks by Union Type in the United States and Across Europe | journal = European Journal of Population = Revue Europeenne de Demographie | volume = 30 | issue = 4 | pages = 437–464 | year = 2014 | pmid = 25395696 | pmc = 4221046 | doi = 10.1007/s10680-014-9320-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, on the contrary, came to the result that cohabiting couples in [[France]] have equal fertility as married ones.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balbo N, Billari FC, Mills M | title = Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research: La fécondité dans les sociétés avancées: un examen des recherches | journal = European Journal of Population = Revue Europeenne de Demographie | volume = 29 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–38 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23440941 | pmc = 3576563 | doi = 10.1007/s10680-012-9277-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large survey in the United States came to the result that married women had an average of 1.9 children, compared to 1.3 among those cohabiting. The corresponding numbers for men were 1.7 and 1.1, respectively. The difference of 0.6 children for both sexes was expected to decrease to between 0.2 and 0.3 over the lifetime when correcting for the [[confounder]] that married people have their children earlier in life.&lt;ref name=us2012&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nhsr/nhsr051.pdf|title=Fertility of Men and Women Aged 15–44 Years in the United States: National Survey of Family Growth, 2006–2010|author1=Gladys Martinez |author2=Kimberly Daniels |author3=Anjani Chandra |publisher=Division of Vital Statistics, [[National Center for Health Statistics]]|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, those who cohabit without marrying had increased fertility when the male earns considerably more than the female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.0042-7092.2007.00700.x |last1=Zhang |first1=Junfu |last2=Song |first2=Xue |title=Fertility Differences between Married and Cohabiting Couples: A Switching Regression Analysis |ssrn=1136407 |url=http://ftp.iza.org/dp3245.pdf |date=December 2007 |doi-broken-date=2018-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frequency of sex===
Another explanation for falling fertility could be a reduction in the frequency of sex. For example, according to the Japan Family Planning Association 2016 survey, 47.3% of the men and 47.1% of the women had not had sex with their spouse in the previous month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rt.com/news/377342-sexless-japanese-marriages-study/ |title=Almost half of Japanese marriages are sexless – study |author=Jeremy Hoare |date=14 February 2017 |website=RT Question More}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and government acceptance of non-traditional families===
In recent years, the marriage rate in many countries (especially in the West) has decreased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://euobserver.com/social/27161 |title=Europeans marry older, less often |author=Elitsa Vucheva |date=21 November 2008 |website=EUobserver}}&lt;/ref&gt; As more young people reject traditional lifestyles that include marriage, the issue arises whether the state accepts non-traditional families such as those based on non-marital [[cohabitation]], or whether it actively discourages non-marital childbearing. In Western countries, the former position of accepting cohabiting couples and supporting them as a legitimate form of family has been connected with a higher fertility rate (e.g. Scandinavian countries, France, where most births occur outside of marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tps00018 |title=Share of live births outside marriage |website=[[Eurostat]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) while the latter (such as East  Asia - Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore) has been connected with a very low fertility rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |others=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division |year=2014 |url=https://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/pdf/fertility/worldFertilityReport2013.pdf |title=World Fertility Report 2013: Fertility at the Extremes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High investment per child===
[[File:Infant mortality map of the world.svg|thumbnail|[[Infant mortality]] rates, under age 1, in 2013. Sub-Saharan Africa has the highest infant mortality rate, as well as the highest TFR.]]
People are more likely in modern society to invest strongly in the needs of their children, such as offering them the best education, shelter (a room only for the child), travel, cultural activities etc. In the past, when [[child mortality]] was high, people had more children, but invested less in them. Today, parents usually experience much less doubt about whether the child will live to adulthood, and so are more likely to strongly invest in that child. But strongly investing in each child makes it more difficult to have large numbers of children—a "quantity vs. quality trade-off" effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |url=http://wol.iza.org/articles/quantity-quality-fertility-education-trade-off.pdf |title=The quantity–quality fertility–education trade-off |author=Haoming Liu |publisher=IZA World of Labor |date=May 2015 |via=wol.iza.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender expectations and norms===
Social norms both within the family and in society at large determine fertility levels.
The quality of couple relations in terms of support given to the woman matters, with studies on fertility in the West showing a U-shaped relationship between [[gender equity]] within the couple and fertility: in countries with very low fertility rates, the probability of a woman to have the second child occurs at the extremes - either very low gender equality or very high gender equality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Balbo N, Billari FC, Mills M |title= Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research [La fécondité dans les sociétés avancées: un examen des recherches] |journal= European Journal of Population [Revue Europeenne De Demographie] |volume= 29 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–38 |date= February 2013 |pmid= 23440941 |pmc= 3576563 |doi= 10.1007/s10680-012-9277-y }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reflected at a social level: countries that are neither sufficiently patriarchal to coerce women into having large families, nor sufficiently egalitarian to incentivize women to have more children through strong support (such as subsidized childcare and good support of working mothers), have very low fertility rates, especially among educated women. Where women are expected to 'choose' between their professional and public life, or having children, the more educated the woman is, the more likely she is to choose the former. The strong emphases on the domestic role of women in Germany (unlike Scandinavia and France) was described as the cause of the very low fertility in that country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Kate Connolly |date=21 September 2012 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/sep/21/germany-birthrate-low-falling |title=Germany's birthrate is the lowest in Europe – and falling fast |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=29 May 2015 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32929962 |title=Germany passes Japan to have world's lowest birth rate – study |newspaper=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Luke Harding |date=26 January 2006 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/27/germany.lukeharding |title=Germany agonises over 30% childless women |newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical effects==
The [[Greeks|Greek]] historian [[Polybius]] largely blamed the decline of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic world]] on low fertility rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= Polybius |authorlink= Polybius |title= Histories |volume= 37 |chapter= Depopulation of Greece |chapter-url= http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%253Atext%253A1999.01.0234%253Abook%253D37%253Achapter%253D9 |website= Perseus |publisher= Tufts |access-date = 2016-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing in his work [[The Histories (Polybius)|''The Histories'']] that:

Some believe that not only the [[Great Recession]], but the [[Great Depression]], may have been the result of a decline in birthrates overall. Clarence L. Barber, an economist at the University of Manitoba, pointed out how demand for housing in the US, for example, began to decline in 1926, due to a decline in 'household formation' (marriage), due, he believed, to the effects of World War I upon society. In early 1929, US housing demand declined precipitously and the stock market crash followed in October of that same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |via= QC econ BBA |chapter-url= http://www.qc-econ-bba.org/instructors/Edelstein11/ECON224/07.pdf |author=Gene Smiley |title=The American Economy in the 20th Century |chapter=Chapter 7: What Caused the Great Depression? |at=Page 7-1 |access-date=2011-12-18 |deadurl= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120309124147/http://www.qc-econ-bba.org/instructors/Edelstein11/ECON224/07.pdf |archive-date=  9 March 2012 |df=dmy-all | quote = Real gross housing expenditures on new units can be separated into two multiplicative components; housing starts and the real average investment per unit.  25 After estimating the determinants of each, Bolch, Fels, and McMahon examined the building hypothesis by simulating what would have been the case in each situation if a "normal" situation had occurred.  26 The result was overbuilding in the number of housing units from 1922 through 1929. They also found "overinvestment" per individual housing unit from 1921 to 1928 and conclude that excessive housing starts relative to family formation led to the sharp decline in housing construction at the end of the twenties. In their view the demographic changes in the twenties were the proximate causes of this.  In a 1978 study Clarence Barber was even more emphatic on the importance of demographic changes, suggesting that these were the ultimate explanation of the Great Depression.  27 Basing his explanation on a Harrod-Domar growth model, Barber argues that the rapid decline in the population's growth rate disturbed that equilibrium, and this rapid fall in the natural growth rate initiated the depression.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attempts to forcefully increase the fertility rate==
{{See|Abortion in Romania|Decree 770|Romanian orphans}}
One of the most notorious policies of forceful attempts to increase the TFR occurred in [[communist Romania]] between 1967 and 1990. Communist leader [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] adopted a very aggressive natalist policy that included outlawing abortion and contraception, routine pregnancy tests for women, [[Tax on childlessness|taxes on childlessness]], and legal discrimination against childless people. This period was depicted in movies and documentaries (such as ''[[4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days]]'', ''[[Children of the Decree]]''). These policies increased birth rates for a few years, but this was followed by a decline due to increased [[illegal abortion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= The ESHRE Capri Workshop Group |title= Europe the continent with the lowest fertility |journal= Human Reproduction Update |volume= 16 |issue= 6 |pages= 590–602 |year= 2010 |pmid= 20603286 |doi= 10.1093/humupd/dmq023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Horga M, Gerdts C, Potts M |title= The remarkable story of Romanian women's struggle to manage their fertility |journal= The Journal of Family Planning and Reproductive Health Care |volume= 39 |issue= 1 |pages= 2–4 |date= January 2013 |pmid= 23296845 |doi= 10.1136/jfprhc-2012-100498 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ceaușescu's policy resulted in over 9,000 women who died due to illegal abortions,&lt;ref name="Kligman short"&gt;{{cite book |last=Kligman |first=Gail |chapter=Political Demography: The Banning of Abortion in Ceausescu's Romania |editor-last1=Ginsburg |editor-first1=Faye D. |editor-last2=Rapp |editor-first2=Rayna |title=Conceiving the New World Order: The Global Politics of Reproduction |location=Berkeley, CA |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |pages=234–255 |id=AIDSLINE KIE/49442}}&lt;/ref&gt; large numbers of children put into orphanages by parents who couldn't cope with raising them, [[street children]] in the 1990s (when many orphanages were closed and the children ended on the streets), and [[overcrowding]] in homes and schools. In addition, Ceaușescu's demographic policies are feared of having very serious effects in the future, because the generations born under Ceaușescu are large (especially the late 1960s and the 1970s), while those born in the 1990s and 2000s are very small. This is believed to cause a very serious demographic shock when the former generations [[Retirement|retire]], as there will be insufficient young people in the workforce to support the elderly.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/ce-se-va-intampla-cand-vor-iesi-la-pensie-decreteii-cei-1-7-milioane-de-romani-care-sustin-economia-5997071{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zf.ro/eveniment/pensiile-decreteilor-sunt-o-bomba-cu-ceas-statul-le-poate-plati-15-din-salariu-la-batranete-10096647{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evz.ro/apocalipsa-pensiilor-vine-dupa-2030-cum-poate-fi-evitata.html{{full|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from Romania, a relatively similar policy of restricted [[reproductive rights]] during that period also existed in [[Communist Albania]], under [[Enver Hoxha]] (see [[Abortion in Albania]]).

==Current effects==
Population aging may pose an economic challenge to governments as the number of retired citizens drawing public pensions rises in relation to the number of workers. This has been raised as a political issue in [[France]], [[Germany]], and the [[United States]] where many people have advocated policy changes to encourage higher birth and immigration rates.

Analysing data for 40 countries, Lee et al. show that fertility well above replacement and population growth would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement and population stability would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility moderately below replacement and population decline would maximize standards of living when the cost of providing capital for a growing labour force is taken into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Lee R, Mason A |title= Is low fertility really a problem?

Note the vertical axis is [[Logarithmic scale|logarithmic]] and represents millions of people.]]
Sub-replacement fertility does not automatically translate into a population decline because of increasing life expectancy and [[population momentum]]: recently high fertility rates produce a disproportionately young population, and younger populations have higher birth rates. This is why some nations with sub-replacement fertility still have a growing population, because a relatively large fraction of their population are still of child-bearing age. But if the fertility trend is sustained (and not compensated by [[immigration]]), it results in [[population ageing]] and/or [[population decline]]. This is already happening and impacts first most of the countries of [[Europe]] and [[East Asia]].

Current estimates expect the world's total fertility rate to fall below replacement levels by 2050,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
though population momentum continues to increase global population for several generations beyond that. The development of the world population is linked with concerns of [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[sustainability]] and exceeding Earth's [[carrying capacity]].

Some governments, fearful of a future pensions crisis, have developed [[natalist]] policies to attempt to encourage more women to have children.  Measures include increasing tax allowances for working parents, improving child-care provision, reducing working hours/weekend working in female-dominated professions such as healthcare and a stricter enforcement of anti-discrimination measures to prevent professional women's promotion prospects being hindered when they take time off work to care for children. Over recent years, the fertility rate has increased to around 2.0 in France and 1.9 in Britain and some other northern European countries, but the role of population policies in these trends is debated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suddenly, the old world looks younger |work=The Economist |date=14 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, for example, natalist policies may have actually discouraged the Italian population from having more children. This "widespread resistance" was the result of the Italian government, at one point,{{when|date=April 2017}} taxing single persons and criminalizing abortion and even contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= Marchesi M |title= Reproducing Italians: contested biopolitics in the age of 'replacement anxiety' |journal= Anthropology &amp; Medicine |volume= 19 |issue= 2 |pages= 171–88 |year= 2012 |pmid= 22889426 |doi= 10.1080/13648470.2012.675043 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

European analysts hope, with the help of government incentives and large-scale change towards family-friendly policies, to stall the population decline and reverse it by around 2030, expecting that most of Europe will have a slight natural increase by then. [[C. D. Howe Institute]], for example, tries to demonstrate that immigration cannot be used to effectively counter [[population ageing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |last1=Guillemette |first1=Yvan |last2=Robson |first2=William B.P. |date=September 2006 |url=http://www.cdhowe.org/pdf/backgrounder_96.pdf |title=No Elixir of Youth: Immigration Cannot Keep Canada Young |work=Backgrounder |issue=96 |publisher=C.D.

==Cases of fertility rate increases in individual countries==

===United States===
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
{{Original research section|date=October 2008}}
While much of the world has experienced declining fertility rates over the last twenty years, the total fertility rate in the [[United States]] has remained relatively stable in comparison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_GraphicalDisplay.aspx?ListNames=%22Total%20Fertility%20Rate,%20History%20plus%20Forecast%22&amp;HistFor=True&amp;GrpOp=0&amp;Dim1=175&amp;File=0 |title= Total Fertility Rate of the United States, History plus Forecast |publisher=University of Denver |website=The Frederick S. Pardee Center for [[International Futures]] | access-date = 26 April 2012}}{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely due to the high fertility rate among communities such as Hispanics, but it is also because the fertility rate among [[non-Hispanic whites]] in the US, after falling to about 1.6 in the 1970s and early 1980s, had increased and is now around 1.89 rather than lower to the 1.6 level common in Europe. It can also be explained by substantial immigration.

[[New England]] has a rate similar to most [[Western European]] countries, while the [[American South|South]], [[Midwest]], and border states have fertility rates considerably higher than replacement. States where [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a strong presence, most notably [[Utah]], also have higher-than-replacement fertility rates, especially among the LDS population. Heaton and Goodman (1985) found that LDS women average about one child more than women in other religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Goodman | first1 = Kristen L. | last2 = Heaton | first2 = Tim B. | year = 1985 | title = Religion and Family Formation | journal = Review of Religious Research | volume = 26 | issue = 4 | pages = 343–359 | jstor = 3511049 | url =  | format =  | access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Israel]] is the only developed country that has never had sub-replacement fertility; a declining [[Arab]] and [[Bedouin]] fertility rate is countered by [[Judaism|religious]] [[Jewish]] groups (mostly [[Haredim]]) with higher than average fertility rates. In addition, the (mostly non-religious){{citation needed|date=June 2013}} [[aliyah]] Jews from the former [[USSR]] shifted from a 1 child per woman fertility rate to an average fertility rate close to 2.2 children per woman. As of 2008, Israel's Jewish fertility rate is the highest among the industrial nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theettingerreport.com/OpEd/General/Demographic-Optimism,-Not-Pessimism.aspx |title=Demographic Optimism, Not Pessimism |author=Yoram Ettinger |work=The Washington Jewish Week |date=25 July 2008 |via=The Ettinger Report |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223001355/http://www.theettingerreport.com/OpEd/General/Demographic-Optimism,-Not-Pessimism.aspx |archive-date=2014-02-23 |access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2736">In [[Telecommunication]] and [[Computer networking]], '''time-driven switching''' (TDS) is a node by node time variant implementation of [[Circuit switching]], where the propagating datagram is shorter in space than the distance between source and destination. With TDS it is no longer necessary to own a complete circuit between source and destination, but only the fraction of circuit where the propagating datagram is temporarily located.
TDS adds flexibility and capacity to Circuit Switched networks but requires precise synchronization among nodes and propagating datagrams. 

Datagrams are formatted according to schedules that depend on [[Quality of service]] and availability of switching nodes and physical links. Respect to [[Circuit switching]] the added time dimension introduces additional complexity to network management. Like [[Circuit switching]], TDS operates without buffers and header processing according to the [[pipeline forwarding]] principle; therefore an all optical implementation with [[Optical fibers]] and [[Optical Switches]] is possible with low cost. The TDS concept itself pervades and is applicable with advantage to existing data switching technologies, including [[Packet switching]], where packets, or sets of packets become the datagrams that are routed through the network.

TDS has been invented in 2002 by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110723202108/http://www.mariobaldi.net/ Prof. Mario Baldi] and prof. [[Yoram Ofek]] of [http://www.synchrodyne.com Synchrodyne Networks, Inc.] that is the assignee of [http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=0&amp;f=S&amp;l=50&amp;TERM1=synchrodyne&amp;FIELD1=ASNM&amp;co1=AND&amp;TERM2=&amp;FIELD2=&amp;d=PTXT several patents] issued by both the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] and the [[European Patent Office]].

'''Transparent heating film''', also called '''transparent heating plastic''' or '''heating transparent polymer film''' is a thin and flexible [[polymer]] film with a [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|conductive]] [[optical coating]]. Transparent heating films may be rated at 2.5{{nbsp}}kW/m{{sup|2}}&lt;!-- see talk page --&gt; at voltages below 48 [[volt]]s [[direct current]] (V{{nbsp}}DC). This allows [[heating]] with secure [[transformer]]s delivering voltages which will not hurt the human body. Transparent conductive polymer films may be used for heating transparent glasses. A combination with [[LEDFilm|transparent SMD electronic]] for multipurpose applications, is also possible. It is also a variant of carbon [[heating film]].

===Accreditation===
In December 21, 2011 the University of Chile was notified by the National Accreditation Commission (CNA) of the positive evaluation in all obligatory areas (institutional management and undergraduate teaching) and electives (research, teaching graduate and linkage with medium). Thus the University is accredited by seven years, the maximum awarded by the agency, for the period between 2011 and 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uchile.cl/reacreditacion|title=Reacreditación institucional – Universidad de Chile|accessdate=June 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Chile, the Catholic University and the University of Concepción are the only institutions in this country that have the highest accreditation.

== History ==
[[Image:AndresBello cropped.png|thumb|left|200px| Andrés Bello, founder and first president of the institution]]
[[Image:U de Chile 1872.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Main House in 1872]]
In 1841 the minister of public education, [[Manuel Montt]], conceived the idea of funding a corporation for the "advancement and development of sciences and humanities". [[Andrés Bello]] a Venezuelan poet and humanist, formulated the project which with small modifications became a law on November 19, 1842, creating the Universidad de Chile.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The foundation answered the need to modernize the country which a little more than two decades before had become independent from Spain. It replaced the Real Universidad de San Felipe, which was established in 1738.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The University was formally opened on September 17, 1843. During this period, the university consisted of five faculties (facultades): '''Humanities &amp; Philosophy''', '''Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences''', '''Law &amp; Political Sciences''', '''Medicine''', and '''Theology'''. During its first years the University gave considerable support to education, institutional organization (such as the "Civil Code", a model for America), the building of the road network to join together the territory, and the energy and production infrastructure.

By 1931, the number of colleges had increased to six: Philosophy &amp; Education Sciences, Legal &amp; Social Sciences, Biology &amp; Medical Sciences, Physical &amp; Mathematical Sciences, Agronomy &amp; Veterinary, and Fine Arts.

The institution has also contributed to the formation of the intellectual elites and leaders of the country. Most of the Chilean presidents have studied in its lecture halls, as well as people with prominent roles in politics, business and culture.

=== Major reforms during the military regime of 1973–1989 ===

During [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s military regime from 1973 to 1989, the University experienced many profound changes. On October 2, 1973, Decree number 50 of 1973 stated that the University's presidents would be designated by the military regime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0716-58112004001500015&amp;script=sci_arttext Jorge Baeza Correa, Referencias para un análisis del discurso del gobierno militar chileno sobre el movimiento estudiantil universitario: 1973–1980. Santiago, 2014] www.scielo.cl&lt;/ref&gt;

The second major change came on January 3, 1981, when another decree completely restructured the University. All of its provincial campuses were separated,&lt;ref&gt;[http://anales.uchile.cl/index.php/ANUC/article/viewFile/25264/28654 Francisco Javier Pinedo Castro. "El nacimiento de una Universidad en el valle central y la amputación de las sedes regionales de la U. de Chile: El caso de la U. de Talca". Revista Anales, Séptima serie n°4, noviembre 2012. Pág 73 y 63] www.anales.uchile.cl&lt;/ref&gt; cojoined with provincial campuses of the Universidad Técnica del Estado (now [[Universidad de Santiago de Chile]] and [[Universidad de Atacama]]) and designated as separate universities, such as the [[Universidad de Talca]], [[Universidad de Valparaiso]], the Instituto Pedagógico (Pedagogical Institute, now the [[Universidad Metropolitana de Ciencias de la Educación]]), the [[Universidad de Antofagasta]], the [[Universidad de Tarapacá]], Instituto Professional de Osorno (now [[Universidad de los Lagos]]), Instituto Professional de Chillán (now [[Universidad del Bío-Bío]]), [[Universidad de la Frontera]], and [[Universidad de la Serena]]. Some faculties, such as the one located in avenida Portugal and which now belongs to the Universidad Mayor, were privatized and sold at bargain prices to Pinochet cronies.

These changes were orchestrated by influential advisors to the dictatorship as a way to moderate the University's influence on the nation's politics, economics, public policies and intellectual movements, considered leftist by Augusto Pinochet and other right-wing government officials.

In spite of the complete restructuring of the University of Chile, it still remains Chile's most prestigious university in terms of research, applicant preferences and social impact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In [[Johan Galtung|Johan Galtung's]] 1969 paper, "Violence, Peace and Peace Research,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galtung|first=Johan|date=1969|title=Violence, Peace and Peace Research|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=6|pages=167–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; he presents his theory of the Conflict Triangle, a framework used in the [[Peace and conflict studies|study of peace and conflict]], with the purpose of defining the three key elements of violence that form this "triangle." The theory is based on the principle that peace must be defined by widely accepted social goals, and that any state of peace is characterized by the absence of violence. When a conflict has features of all three areas of violence, the result is a more consolidated, static state of violence in a social system, which may include a conflict or a nation-state, whereas the absence of these three typologies of violence results in peace.

== Structural Violence ==
[[Structural violence|Structural Violence]], also referred to as social injustice, is defined as injustice and inequality built into the structure of society, resulting in unequal power and, subsequently, imbalanced life chances. There is no requirement for a clear actor to be defined as committing the violence, rather it is embedded within the institutions of the society, where the power to decide the distribution of resources is uneven. Rather than conveying a physical image, structural violence is an avoidable impairment of [[fundamental human needs]]. Structural violence is increased in situations where low income individuals also suffer in the rank dimensions of education, health, and power. This is due to an overall consolidation of factors in the social structure, resulting in a high correlation between social class and disempowerment. Structural violence can be recognized through its relative stability, having been built into the social structure. This can make structural violence difficult to ascertain, despite its often vast consequences. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of the most notable are listed below.

[[Akhil Gupta]] argued in 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Red Tape: Bureaucracy, Structural Violence and Poverty in India|last=Gupta|first=Akhil|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that structural violence has been the key influence in the nature and distribution of extreme suffering in India, driven by the Indian state in its alleged corruption, overly bureaucratic standards of governance used to exclude the middle and working classes from the political system through a system of politicized poverty.

Jacklyn Cock’s 1989 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cock|first=Jacklyn|date=1989|title=Keeping the Fires Burning: Militarization and the Politics of Gender in South Africa|url=|journal=Review of African Political Economy|volume=|pages=50–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Review of African Political Economy]] applied Galtung’s theory of structural violence, analysing the role of militarized society under the [[Apartheid|apartheid regime of South Africa]] in the development of patriarchal values that is a form of structural violence against women. Cock found that tacit misdirection of women in society by its leadership focused their energies toward the direct and indirect incorporation of the patriarchal regime in order to maintain the status quo.

Mats Utas claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Utas|first=Mats|date=2003|title=Sweet Battlefields: Youth and the Liberian Civil War|url=|journal=Uppsla University Dissertations in Cultural Anthropology|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that even those youth in Liberia indirectly unaffected by direct violence in the [[First Liberian Civil War|civil war of 1989-1996]] suffered from structural violence in the form of association with different blocs, leading to poverty, joblessness and marginalisation effects.

== Cultural Violence ==
Cultural violence is defined as any aspect of a culture that can be used to legitimise violence in its direct or structural form. Unlike direct and structural violence, then, cultural violence is a foundational principle for extended conflict. The existence of prevailing or prominent social norms make direct and structural violence seem natural or at least acceptable, and serves to explain how prominent beliefs can become so embedded in a given culture that they function as absolute and inevitable and are reproduced uncritically across generations. Galtung expanded on the concept of cultural violence in a 1990 paper&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galtung|first=Johan|date=1990|title=Cultural Violence|url=|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=27|pages=291–305}}&lt;/ref&gt; also published in the Journal of Peace Research. This concept has been applied in a limited number of cases, with most occurring after Galtung’s follow up paper in 1990,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; some of the most notable of which are listed below.

In [[Ed Husain]]'s 2007 book&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Islamist|last=Husain|first=Ed|publisher=Penguin|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Islamist]], seminal extremist literature such as [[Sayyid Qutb]]'s [[Milestones (book)|Milestones]] is highlighted  as being particularly influential on many young Muslims in terms of defining their identity and life goals, in which the book embodies the principles outlined whereby there is a cultural imperative for violence built into the societal values or cultural values of Islam through such [[Extremism|extremist]] literature.

Gregory Phillips argues in his 2003 book, Addictions and Healing in Aboriginal Country,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Addictions and Healing in Aboriginal Country|last=Philips|first=Gregory|publisher=|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that resistance to the Western medical sphere driven by [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians|previous atrocities]] committed against the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal community]] has led to a fierce resistance effort against modern medicine, addiction treatment and perhaps fuels a desire to seek out drugs and illicit substances as a starting point of addiction. Wide scale suspicion against medical practitioners and government representatives has become engendered in the Aboriginal community.

In Enduring Violence: Ladina Women's Lives in Guatemala,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Enduring Violence|last=Menjívar|first=Cecilia|publisher=|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2011 book by [[Cecilia Menjívar]], it is argued that the preexisting cultural conditions of ''mediania'', or half and half, agriculture led to women facing large scale cultural violence due to high rents, low returns and high required investment with additionally harsh conditions due to the conflict in Guatemala. Given the patriarchal culture of Guatemala, any earnings would go to the partner of the working woman, leaving a large poverty gap enshrined in the demographic diversity of the country.

== Direct Violence ==
Direct Violence is characterised as having an actor that commits the violence, and is thus able to be traced back to persons as actors. Direct violence shows less stability, given it is subject to the preference sets of individuals, and thus is more easily recognised. Direct violence is the most visible, occurring [[Physical abuse|physically]] or [[Verbal abuse|verbally]], and the victim and the offender can be clearly identified. Direct violence is highly interdependent with structural and cultural violence: cultural and structural violence causes direct violence which on the other hand reinforces the former ones. This concept has been applied in a large number of cases, some of which are listed below.

A 2011 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icrw.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Solutions-to-End-Child-Marriage.pdf|title=Solutions to End Child Marriage|last=Malhotra|first=Anju|date=|website=ICRW|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[International Center for Research on Women]] (ICRW) demonstrated the widespread nature of [[child marriage]] in [[South Asia]]. The ICRW highlighted marriage before the age of 18 as a fundamental human rights violation, one that leads to early childbearing, with significantly higher maternal mortality and morbidity rates as well as higher infant mortality rates amongst women. The paper most directly presented evidence to show that child brides are at heightened risk of violence in the home.

In Matthew Chandler's 2009 paper&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chandler|first=Matthew|date=2009|title=When armed combatants employ nonviolent action: A case study of Hezbollah|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/304844175/abstract/F1B927DF887E448CPQ/1?accountid=12768|journal=ProQuest Dissertations Publishing|volume=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on so-called "non-violent" techniques utilised by [[Hezbollah]] still include forms of Direct Violence, most notably the threat of violence toward [[Fouad Siniora]]'s allies after his 2008 order to dismantle the Hezbollah telecommunications network in 2008, which led to the freezing of the order. Further, Hezbollah are argued to have used their operation of [[Hezbollah social services|social services]], in lieu of government operations, as a ransom for support as well as rewarding their fighters with guaranteed healthcare and support for their families. Chandler argues this is due to opposition within the group to harming Lebanese civilians, who they view as "their own", or exacerbating conflict through civil war.

In 2005, Steven Wright made the case&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright|first=Steven|date=2005|title=Violent Peacekeeping: The Rise and Rise of Repressive Techniques and Technologies|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1743453X0500100106|journal=Politics and Ethics Review|volume=1|pages=60–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; for Peacekeeping efforts to be regarded as violence due to increasing use of techniques such as pre-interrogation treatment, and the use of non-lethal weapons such as tear gas for crowd dispersal and plastic bullets, which he terms "torture-lite", being increasingly common in peacekeeping manuals across a number of nation-states and supranational organisations.

== Reinforcing Factors ==
Galtung focuses a section of the paper on the means of direct and structural violence, in particular, developing groups of factors that may be included as types of such forms and methods of maintaining and reinforcing the mechanisms of such violence. In terms of reinforcing factors, Galtung identifies six key areas:

;Linear Ranking Order
:Systems in which there is an open and complete ranking of actors leaves no doubt as to the actor who is ranked more highly, and is thus a mechanism of structural violence due to the reinforcement of an existing power dynamic.
;Acyclical Interaction Pattern
:Systems in which all actors are connected via a one-way ‘correct’ path of interaction, where outcomes are structurally dependent on using this system in the intended way of its design. This makes structural systems stable, as change can only be achieved through this consolidated [[Selectorate theory|power-seeking and power-retaining system]].
;Rank-Centrality Correlation
:Within the social system, actors that are higher ranked are more central within the system itself, reinforcing their importance to the status quo as well as their incentives to maintain it.
;(4)  System Congruence
:Social systems are made up of similar components, allowing those who are ranked highly and are successful at mobilising one system shifting from a comparative advantage within one system to an absolute advantage over all systems of desired operation.
;Rank Concordance
:Actors that are ranked highly within one metric, such as income, are also ranked highly on other metrics such as education and health. This congruence is also present in actors ranked low within these metrics, and serves to limit [[Social mobility|mobility within the social system]].
;Interlevel High Rank Coupling
:Collaboration amongst the highest ranks results in the system being defined in such a way that benefits the most powerful actors, usually through a sub optimally ranked representative (not the highest ranked actor), which limits allegations of system consolidation by the most powerful.

Beyond Galtung’s initial paper and thesis, scholars have applied the Conflict Triangle to a broad array of conflicts, struggles and occupations since 1969, and retroactively.

== Criticism ==
[[Johan Galtung]]'s Conflict Triangle and Peace Research paper are widely cited as the foundational pieces of theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Peace processes: a Sociological Approach|last=Brewer|first=John D.|publisher=Polity Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; within peace and conflict studies. However, they are not without criticism. Galtung uses very broad definitions of [[violence]], [[Conflict (process)|conflict]] and [[peace]], and applies the terms of mean both direct and indirect, negative and positive, and violence in which one cannot distinguish actors or victims, which serves to limit the direct application of the model itself.

Galtung uses a [[Positivism|positivist]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Question of Values: Johan Galtung's Peace Research|last=Lawler|first=Peter|publisher=Lynne Rienner|year=1995|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in that he assumes that every rational tenet of the theory can be verified, serving to reject social processes beyond relationships and actions. This approach enforces a paradigm of clear-cut, currently testable propositions as the ‘whole’ of the system, and thus is often deemed [[Reductionism|reductionist]]. Galtung also wields an explicit [[normative]] orientation in the paper, in which there is a weighting toward evaluative statements that may show bias or simply opinion, or indeed a trend toward the [[institution]]s and concepts of peace in the West, which may serve to limit the applicability of the model more widely.

[[Image:Indonesia Wallacea.svg|thumb|350px|Wallacea is the group of islands within the red area. The [[Max Carl Wilhelm Weber|Weber Line]] is in blue.]]

'''Wallacea''' is a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] designation for a group of mainly [[Indonesia]]n islands separated by deep-water [[strait]]s from the [[Asia]]n and [[Australia (continent)|Australian]] [[continental shelf|continental shelves]]. Wallacea includes [[Sulawesi]], the largest island in the group, as well as [[Lombok]], [[Sumbawa]], [[Flores]], [[Sumba]], [[Timor]], [[Halmahera]], [[Buru]], [[Seram]], and many smaller islands. 

The islands of Wallacea lie between [[Sundaland]] (the [[Malay Peninsula]], [[Sumatra]], [[Borneo]], [[Java (island)|Java]], and [[Bali]]) to the west, and [[Near Oceania]] including [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] to the south and east. The total land area of Wallacea is 347,000&amp;nbsp;km².

|}
[[Image:Map of Sunda and Sahul.png|350px|thumb|The Sahul and Sunda shelves. Wallacea is the area in between.]]

==Geography==

The boundary between Sundaland and Wallacea follows the [[Wallace Line]], named after the naturalist [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] who noted the differences in mammal and bird fauna between the islands either side of the line. The islands of Sundaland to the west of the line, including Sumatra, Java, Bali, and Borneo, share a [[mammal]] fauna similar to that of East Asia, including tigers, rhinoceros, and apes, whereas those from [[Lombok]] and eastward are mostly populated by marsupials and birds similar to those in Australasia. Sulawesi shows signs of both.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation|title=The Malay Archipelago|first=Alfred Russel|last=Wallace|year=1869|pages=25–29|url=https://archive.org/stream/malayarchipelag05wallgoog#page/n42/mode/2up|accessdate=22 Jan 2013}}
&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the ice ages, sea levels were lower, exposing the [[Sunda shelf]] that links the islands of Sundaland to one another and to Asia,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fieldmuseum.org/research_collections/zoology/zoo_sites/seamaps/mapindex1.htm Pleistocene Sea Level Maps&lt;/ref&gt; and allowed Asian land animals to inhabit these islands. The islands of Wallacea have few land mammals, land birds, or freshwater fish of continental origin, who find it difficult to [[oceanic dispersal|cross open ocean]]. Many bird, reptile, and insect species were better able to cross the straits, and many such species of Australian and Asian origin are found there. Wallacea's plants are predominantly of Asian origin, and botanists include Sundaland, Wallacea, and New Guinea as the [[floristic province]] of Malaya.

Similarly, [[Australia]] and [[New Guinea]] to the east are linked by a shallow continental shelf, and were linked by a land bridge during the ice ages, forming a single continent that scientists variously call [[Australia-New Guinea]], Meganesia, Papualand, or Sahul. Consequently, Australia, New Guinea, and the [[Aru Islands]] share many [[marsupial]] mammals, land birds, and freshwater fish that are not found in Wallacea.&lt;ref&gt;http://actazool.nhmus.hu/48Suppl2/newwallace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The line dividing Wallacea from Australia–New Guinea is called [[Lydekker's Line]]. The [[Philippines]] is usually considered a separate region from Wallacea.&lt;ref&gt;http://actazool.nhmus.hu/48Suppl2/newwallace.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Weber Line]] is the midpoint where Asian and Australian fauna and flora are approximately equally represented, and follows the deepest [[strait]]s traversing the [[Indonesian Archipelago]].

==Biota and conservation issues==
[[Image:Wallacea.png|thumb|350px|A map of Wallacea, bordered by the Wallace and the Lydekker Line.]]

Although the distant ancestors of Wallacea's plants and animals may have been from Asia or Australia-New Guinea, Wallacea is home to many [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] species. There is extensive [[wikt:autochthonous|autochthonous]] [[speciation]] and proportionately large numbers of [[Endemism|endemics]]; it is an important contributor to the overall mega-[[biodiversity]] of the Indonesian archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irgltd.com/Resources/Publications/ANE/2004-02%20Indonesia%20Biodiversity%20and%20Tropical%20Forest.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306124053/http://irgltd.com/Resources/Publications/ANE/2004-02%20Indonesia%20Biodiversity%20and%20Tropical%20Forest.pdf |archivedate=2009-03-06 |df= }} page 3-2&lt;/ref&gt; Because many of the islands are separated from one another by deep water, there is tremendous species diversity among the islands as well.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Fauna species include the endemic [[anoa]] (dwarf buffalo) of [[Sulawesi]] and the [[babirusa]] (deer pig).  Maluku shows a degree of species similarity with Sulawesi, but with fewer flora and fauna. Smaller mammals including primates are common. [[Seram]] is noted for its butterflies and birdlife including the [[Amboina king parrot]].

Wallacea was originally almost completely forested, mostly [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forests]], with some areas of [[Tropical and subtropical dry broadleaf forests|tropical dry broadleaf forest]]. The higher mountains are home to [[Montane forest|montane]] and [[subalpine]] forests, and [[mangroves]] are common in coastal areas. According to Conservation International, Wallacea is home to over 10,000 plant species, of which approximately 1500 (15%) are endemic.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} 

Endemism is higher among terrestrial vertebrate species; of 1142 species found there, almost half (529) are endemic. 45%  of the region retains some sort of forest cover, and only 52,017&amp;nbsp;km², or 15 percent, is in pristine state. Of Wallacea's total area of 347,000&amp;nbsp;km², about 20,000&amp;nbsp;km² are protected.

Wallacea is home to 82 threatened and six critically endangered species of terrestrial vertebrates.

==Distribution between Asia and Australasia==
{{Refimprove|date=December 2008}}

Australia may be isolated by sea, but technically through Wallacea it can be zoologically extended. An example of evidence for when Wallacea formed exists at the [[Bluff Downs fossil site]] in northern Australia. Remains of basaltic lava show past oceanic subduction as Australia ploughed north through the Pacific. At the site, one of the earliest Australian rodent fossils has been found. [[List of Australian rodents|Australia's rodents]] make up much of the continent's [[placental mammal]] fauna and include various species from stick-nest rats, hopping mice, and even giant beaver rats. Other mammals invaded west. Two species of [[cuscus]] from Sulawesi are among the most primitive possums in the world and the only marsupials in Asia.

Birds have expanded their range to and from Australia. Crows and shrikes invaded south into New Guinea and some into the Australian continent. [[Bustards]] and [[megapode]]s must have somehow colonized Australia. [[Cockatiel]]s similar to those from Australia inhabit Komodo Island in Wallacea.

A few species of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'', a predominant genus of trees in Australia, are found in Wallacea: ''[[Eucalyptus deglupta]]'' on Sulawesi, and ''[[Eucalyptus urophylla|E. urophylla]]'' and ''[[Eucalyptus alba|E. alba]]'' in East Nusa Tenggara.&lt;ref&gt;Irfan Budi Pramono and Ag.

{{Democracy}}
In [[political science]], a '''wave of democracy''' refers to a major surge of [[democracy]] in history. The term "Third Wave of Democracy" was first coined by [[Samuel P. Huntington]], a political scientist at [[Harvard University]] in his article published in the ''[[Journal of Democracy]]'' and further expounded in his 1991 book ''[[The Third Wave: Democratization in the Late Twentieth Century]]''. 

Huntington describes global democratization as coming in three waves, the first beginning in the early 19th century and the third being a current event.&lt;ref name="huntington"&gt;{{cite news

|title=What Is Democracy? - Democracy's Third Wave 
|publisher=U.S. State Department
|accessdate=2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars, such as Seva Gunitsky of University of Toronto, have referred to 13 waves from the 18th century to the Arab Spring (2011-2012).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunitsky|first=Seva|date=2018|title=Democratic Waves in Historical Perspective|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/democratic-waves-in-historical-perspective/9452AFC439DD960F4D219246A7E7F51E|journal=Perspectives on Politics|language=en|volume=16|issue=3|pages=634–651|doi=10.1017/S1537592718001044|issn=1537-5927|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Huntingon's three waves==
===First wave=== 
The First wave of democracy began in the early 19th century when [[suffrage]] was granted to the majority of white males in the [[United States]] ("[[Jacksonian democracy]]"). At its peak, the first wave saw 29 democracies in the world. This continued until 1922, when [[Benito Mussolini]] rose to power in [[Italy]]. The ebb of the first wave lasted from 1922 until 1942, during which the number of democracies in the world dropped to a mere 12.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

===Second wave===

The Second wave began following the Allied victory in [[World War II]], and crested nearly 20 years later in 1962 with 36 recognised democracies in the world. The Second wave ebbed as well at this point, and the total number dropped to 30 democracies between 1962 and the mid-1970s. But the "flat line" would not last for long, as the third wave was about to surge in a way no one had ever seen.&lt;ref name ="huntington"/&gt;

Scholars have noted that the appearance of "waves" of democracy largely disappears when women's suffrage is taken into account; moreover, some countries change their positions quite dramatically: [[Switzerland]], which is typically included as part of the first wave, did not grant women the right to vote until 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Paxton, Pamela. (2000). “Women's Suffrage in the Measurement of Democracy: Problems of Operationalization.” ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 35(3): 92-111&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third wave===

The Third wave began in 1974 ([[Carnation Revolution]], Portugal) and included the historic democratic transitions in Latin America in the 1980s, Asia Pacific countries and regions ([[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], and [[Taiwan]]) from 1986 to 1988, Eastern Europe after the collapse of the Soviet Union, and sub-Saharan Africa beginning in 1989. The expansion of democracy in some regions was stunning. In Latin America only Colombia, Costa Rica, and Venezuela were democratic by 1978 and only Cuba and Haiti remained authoritarian by 1995, when the wave had swept across twenty countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schenoni, Luis and Scott Mainwaring|title=Hegemonic Effects and Regime Change in Latin America|journal=Democratization|doi=10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13510347.2018.1516754?journalCode=fdem20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures there are well over 100 democracies in the world today{{when|date=November 2016}}, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{cn|date=November 2016}}  Many of these newer democracies are not fully "consolidated," however, meaning that while they have electoral institutions in place, political democracy remains fragile.  Reasons for this fragility include economic instability, continued elite dominance of politics, ongoing military interference in civilian affairs, and others.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Larry. (1996). “Is the Third Wave Over?” ''Journal of Democracy'' 7(3).&lt;/ref&gt;

Countries undergoing or having undergone a transition to democracy during a wave are subject to [[democratic backsliding]]. Political scientists and theorists believe that the third wave has crested and will soon begin to ebb, just as its predecessors did in the first and second waves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zagorski|first=Paul W.|title=Democratic Breakdown in Paraguay and Venezuela: The Shape of Things to Come for Latin America?|journal=Armed Forces &amp; Society|year=2003|volume=30|issue=1|pages=87–116|doi=10.1177/0095327X0303000104|url=http://afs.sagepub.com/content/30/1/87.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the period immediately following the onset of the "war on terror" after the [[September 11, 2001]] attacks on the United States, some backsliding was evident.  How significant or lasting that erosion is remains a subject of debate.

After the Great Recession of 2008, a number of countries backslided from democracy including Thailand, Cambodia, Philippines, Turkey, Hungary, Poland, Honduras and the Maldives. Some other countries have had democratic transitions however, such as Tunisia and the Gambia. There has also been limited democratic reform in some countries, such as Burma and Morocco. {{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

==Arab Spring==
Experts have associated the collapse of several dictatorships in the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]], phenomenon known as Arab Spring, with the events which followed the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Eastern Europe]]. The similarity between the two phenomena inspired hope for a fourth wave of [[democratization]]. However, a few months after the apparent beginning of the transition, most of the Arab political openings closed, causing an inevitable pull-back. One of the most alarming cases was that of Egypt, where the government, controlled by the military, did not facilitate the democratic transition in any way. On the contrary, it strove to silence the protests by arresting peaceful protesters and by “trying them in military tribunals.”{{fact|date=March 2018}} A concrete example is provided by the story of [[Maikel Nabil Sanad|Maikel Nabil]], an Egyptian blogger convicted to be imprisoned for three years for “insulting the [[military]] establishment.” The main causes of the regression and crisis in all the affected countries are attributed to corruption, unemployment, social injustice, and autocratic political systems.

Despite the apparently unsolvable situation, the [[United Nations|UN]], under the administration of [[Ban Ki-moon|Ban Ki-Moon]], tried to work as a mediator between the governments and the protesters. Moreover, according to [[Larry Diamond]], the engagement of the [[United States|United States of America]] in the democratic transition of the Arab world was fundamental. He attributed to the country the role of mentor and example for the newborn democracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2011-05-22/fourth-wave-or-false-start|title = A Fourth Wave or False Start?|website = Foreign Affairs|access-date = 2016-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital media]] played a much longer term role in creating favorable conditions for uprisings, helped to publicize key igniting events, and then facilitated those uprisings and their diffusion; but digital media did not do this alone or as suddenly as some observers have claimed. The story of the Arab Spring, according to Howard and Hussain, began over a decade ago as Internet access and mobile phones began to diffuse rapidly through North Africa and the Middle East. The citizens that could afford internet access, the wealthy and powerful mostly, played a huge role in the [[Egypt]], [[Tunisia]], and [[Bahrain]] [[Rebellion|uprisings]]. Over time, online criticisms of regimes became more public and common, setting the stage for the [[Arab Spring]]. Digital media also allowed women and other minorities to enter these political discussions, and, ultimately, the ensuing protests and revolutions as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Howard|first = Phillip N. |date= 2013 |title= Democracy’s Fourth Wave?
