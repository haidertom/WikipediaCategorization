'''Actuarial notation''' is a shorthand method to allow [[Actuary|actuaries]] to record mathematical formulas that deal with [[Interest|interest rates]] and [[life tables]].

Traditional notation uses a [[halo system]] where symbols are placed as [[superscript]] or [[subscript]] before or after the main letter. Example notation using the halo system can be seen below.

Various proposals have been made to adopt a linear system where all the notation would be on a single line without the use of superscripts or subscripts. Such a method would be useful for computing where representation of the halo system can be extremely difficult. However, a standard linear system has yet to emerge.

==Example notation==

===Interest rates===
&lt;math&gt;\,i&lt;/math&gt; is the annual [[effective interest rate]], which is the "true" rate of interest over ''a year''. Thus if the annual interest rate is 12% then &lt;math&gt;\,i = 0.12&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; (pronounced "i ''upper'' m") is the [[nominal interest rate]] convertible &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times a year, and is numerically equal to &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; times the effective rate of interest over one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt; of a year. For example, &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}&lt;/math&gt; is the nominal rate of interest convertible semiannually. If the effective annual rate of interest is 12%, then &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}/2&lt;/math&gt; represents the effective interest rate every six months. Since &lt;math&gt;\,(1.0583)^{2}=1.12&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}/2=0.0583&lt;/math&gt; and hence &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(2)}=0.1166&lt;/math&gt;. The &lt;sup&gt;"(m)"&lt;/sup&gt; appearing in the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; is not an "[[exponent]]." It merely represents the number of interest conversions, or compounding times, per year. Semi-annual compounding, (or converting interest every six months), is frequently used in valuing [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] (see also [[fixed income securities]]) and similar [[monetary financial liability]] instruments, whereas home [[mortgages]] frequently convert interest monthly. Following the above example again where &lt;math&gt;\,i=0.12&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(12)}=0.1139&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\,\left(1+\frac{0.1139}{12}\right)^{12}=1.12&lt;/math&gt;.

Effective and nominal rates of interest are not the same because interest paid in earlier measurement periods "earns" interest in later measurement periods; this is called [[compound interest]]. That is, nominal rates of interest credit interest to an investor, (alternatively charge, or [[debit]], interest to a debtor), more frequently than do effective rates. The result is more frequent compounding of interest income to the investor, (or interest expense to the debtor), when nominal rates are used.

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\,v&lt;/math&gt; represents the [[present value]] of 1 to be paid one year from now:
:&lt;math&gt;\,v = {(1+i)}^{-1}\approx 1-i+i^2&lt;/math&gt;
This present value factor, or discount factor, is used to determine the amount of money that must be invested now in order to have a given amount of money in the future. For example, if you need 1 in one year, then the amount of money you should invest now is: &lt;math&gt;\,1 \times v&lt;/math&gt;. If you need 25 in 5 years the amount of money you should invest now is: &lt;math&gt;\,25 \times v^5&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; is the [[annual effective discount rate]]:
:&lt;math&gt;d = \frac{i}{1+i}\approx i-i^2&lt;/math&gt;
The value of &lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; can also be calculated from the following relationships: &lt;math&gt;\,(1-d) = v = {(1+i)}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
The rate of discount equals the amount of interest earned during a one-year period, divided by the balance of money at the end of that period. By contrast, an annual effective rate of interest is calculated by dividing the amount of interest earned during a one-year period by the balance of money at the beginning of the year. The present value (today) of a payment of 1 that is to be made &lt;math&gt;\,n&lt;/math&gt; years in the future is &lt;math&gt;\,{(1-d)}^{n}&lt;/math&gt;. This is analogous to the formula &lt;math&gt;\,{(1+i)}^{n}&lt;/math&gt; for the future (or accumulated) value &lt;math&gt;\,n&lt;/math&gt; years in the future of an amount of 1 invested today.

&lt;math&gt;\,d^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;, the nominal rate of discount convertible &lt;math&gt;\,m&lt;/math&gt; times a year, is analogous to &lt;math&gt;\,i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;. Discount is converted on an &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''th''&lt;/sup&gt;-ly basis.

&lt;math&gt;\,\delta&lt;/math&gt;, the [[force of interest]], is the limiting value of the nominal rate of interest when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; increases without bound:

:&lt;math&gt;\,\delta = \lim_{m\to\infty}i^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, interest is [[continuously compounded interest|convertible continuously]].

The general relationship between &lt;math&gt;\,i&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\,\delta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,d&lt;/math&gt; is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,(1+i) = \left(1+\frac{i^{(m)}}{m}\right)^{m} = e^{\delta} = \left(1-\frac{d^{(m)}}{m}\right)^{-m} = (1-d)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Their numerical value can be compared as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\, i &gt; i^{(2)} &gt; i^{(3)} &gt; \cdots &gt; \delta &gt; \cdots &gt; d^{(3)} &gt; d^{(2)} &gt; d&lt;/math&gt;

===Life tables===
A [[life table]] (or a mortality table) is a mathematical construction that shows the number of people alive (based on the assumptions used to build the table) at a given age. In addition to the number of lives remaining at each age, a mortality table typically provides various probabilities associated with the development of these values.

&lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of people alive, relative to an original cohort, at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. As age increases the number of people alive decreases.

&lt;math&gt;\,l_0&lt;/math&gt; is the starting point for &lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt;: the number of people alive at age 0. This is known as the '''radix''' of the table. Some mortality tables begin at an age greater than 0, in which case the radix is the number of people assumed to be alive at the youngest age in the table.

&lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the limiting age of the mortality tables. &lt;math&gt;\,l_n&lt;/math&gt; is zero for all &lt;math&gt;\,n \geq \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,d_x&lt;/math&gt; is the number of people who die between age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\,d_x&lt;/math&gt; may be calculated using the formula &lt;math&gt;\,d_x = l_x - l_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,q_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of death between the ages of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,q_x = d_x / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,p_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will survive to age &lt;math&gt;x + 1&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,p_x = l_{x+1} / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

Since the only possible alternatives from one age (&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;) to the next (&lt;math&gt;x+1&lt;/math&gt;) are living and dying, the relationship between these two probabilities is:

:&lt;math&gt;\,p_x+q_x=1&lt;/math&gt;

These symbols may also be extended to multiple years, by inserting the number of years at the bottom left of the basic symbol.

&lt;math&gt;\,_nd_x = d_x + d_{x+1} + \cdots + d_{x+n-1} = l_x - l_{x+n}&lt;/math&gt; shows the number of people who die between age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\,_nq_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of death between the ages of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,_nq_x = {}_nd_x / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,_np_x&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a life age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; will survive to age &lt;math&gt;x + n&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt;\,_np_x = l_{x+n} / l_x&lt;/math&gt;

Another statistic that can be obtained from a life table is [[life expectancy]].

&lt;math&gt;\,e_x&lt;/math&gt; is the curtate expectation of life for a person alive at age &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This is the expected number of complete years remaining to live (you may think of it as the expected number of birthdays that the person will celebrate).

:&lt;math&gt;\,e_x = \sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \ _tp_x&lt;/math&gt;

A life table generally shows the number of people alive at integral ages. If we need information regarding a fraction of a year, we must make assumptions with respect to the table, if not already implied by a mathematical formula underlying the table. A common assumption is that of a Uniform Distribution of Deaths (UDD) at each year of age. Under this assumption, &lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+t}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[linear interpolation]] between &lt;math&gt;\,l_x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+1}&lt;/math&gt;. i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;\,l_{x+t} = (1 - t)l_x + tl_{x+1} &lt;/math&gt;

===Annuities===
The basic symbol for the present value of an [[Annuity (finance theory)|annuity]] is &lt;math&gt;\,a&lt;/math&gt;. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the frequency of payment (i.e., the number of annuity payments that will be made during each year). A lack of such notation means that payments are made annually.
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the annuity starts and the period for which an annuity is paid.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates when payments are made. Two dots indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the beginning of each year (an "annuity-due"); a horizontal line above the symbol indicates an annuity payable continuously (a "continuous annuity"); no mark above the basic symbol indicates an annuity whose payments are made at the end of each year (an "annuity-immediate").

If the payments to be made under an annuity are independent of any life event, it is known as an [[Annuity (European financial arrangements)#Annuity certain|annuity-certain]]. Otherwise, in particular if payments end upon the [[beneficiary]]'s death, it is called a [[life annuity]].

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; (read ''a-angle-n at i'') represents the present value of an annuity-immediate, which is a series of unit payments at the end of each year for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years (in other words: the value one period before the first of ''n'' payments). This value is obtained from:

:&lt;math&gt;\,a_{\overline{n|}i} = v + v^2 + \cdots + v^n = \frac{1-v^n}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; represents the present value of an annuity-due, which is a series of unit payments at the beginning of each year for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years (in other words: the value at the time of the first of ''n'' payments). This value is obtained from:

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i} = 1 + v + \cdots + v^{n-1} = \frac{1-v^n}{d}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\,s_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; is the value at the time of the last payment, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{s}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; the value one period later.

If the symbol &lt;math&gt;\,(m)&lt;/math&gt; is added to the top-right corner, it represents the present value of an annuity whose payments occur each one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;th of a year for a period of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; years, and each payment is one &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;th of a unit.

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} = \frac{1-v^n}{i^{(m)}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} = \frac{1-v^n}{d^{(m)}}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt; is the limiting value of &lt;math&gt;\,a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt; when &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; increases without bound. The underlying annuity is known as a [[continuous annuity]].

:&lt;math&gt;\overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i}= \frac{1-v^n}{\delta}&lt;/math&gt;

The present values of these annuities may be compared as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{n|}i} &lt; a_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)} &lt; \overline{a}_{\overline{n|}i} &lt; \ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt; \ddot{a}_{\overline{n|}i}&lt;/math&gt;

To understand the relationships shown above, consider that cash flows paid at a later time have a smaller present value than cash flows of the same total amount that are paid at earlier times.

* The subscript &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; which represents the rate of interest may be replaced by &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, and is often omitted if the rate is clearly known from the context.
* When using these symbols, the rate of interest is not necessarily constant throughout the lifetime of the annuities. However, when the rate varies, the above formulas will no longer be valid; particular formulas can be developed for particular movements of the rate.

===Life annuities===
A life annuity is an annuity whose payments are contingent on the continuing life of the annuitant. The age of the annuitant is an important consideration in calculating the [[actuarial present value]] of an annuity.

* The age of the annuitant is placed at the bottom right of the symbol, without an "angle" mark.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\,a_{65}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the end of each year until death to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{10|}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable for 10 years with payments being made at the end of each year

&lt;math&gt;a_{65:\overline{10|}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year for 10 years, or until death if earlier, to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;a_{65:64}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the earlier death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64

&lt;math&gt;a_{\overline{65:64}}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year until the later death of member or death of spouse, to someone currently age 65 and spouse age 64. 

&lt;math&gt;a_{65}^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable 12 times a year (1/12 unit per month) until death to someone currently age 65

&lt;math&gt;{\ddot{a}}_{65}&lt;/math&gt; indicates an annuity of 1 unit per year payable at the start of each year until death to someone currently age 65

or in general:

&lt;math&gt;a_{x:\overline{n|}i}^{(m)}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the age of the annuitant, &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the number of years of payments (or until death if earlier), &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of payments per year, and &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the interest rate.

In the interest of simplicity the notation is limited and does not, for example, show whether the annuity is payable to a man or a woman (a fact that would typically be determined from the context, including whether the life table is based on male or female mortality rates).
 
The Actuarial Present Value of life contingent payments can be treated as the mathematical expectation of a present value random variable, or calculated through the current payment form.

===Life insurance===
The basic symbol for a [[life insurance]] is &lt;math&gt;\,A&lt;/math&gt;. The following notation can then be added:

* Notation to the top-right indicates the timing of the payment of a death benefit. A lack of notation means payments are made at the end of the year of death. A figure in parenthesis (for example &lt;math&gt;A^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt;) means the benefit is payable at the end of the period indicated (12 for monthly; 4 for quarterly; 2 for semi-annually; 365 for daily).
* Notation to the bottom-right indicates the age of the person when the life insurance begins.
* Notation directly above the basic symbol indicates the "type" of life insurance, whether payable at the end of the period or immediately. A horizontal line indicates life insurance payable immediately, whilst no mark above the symbol indicates payment is to be made at the end of the period indicated.

For example:

&lt;math&gt;\,A_x&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the year of death.

&lt;math&gt;\,A_x^{(12)}&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the end of the month of death.

&lt;math&gt;\,\overline{A}_x&lt;/math&gt; indicates a life insurance benefit of 1 payable at the (mathematical) instant of death.

== Force of mortality ==

Among actuaries, '''force of mortality''' refers to what [[economists]] and other social scientists call the [[hazard rate]] and is construed as an instantaneous rate of mortality at a certain age measured on an annualized basis.

In a life table, we consider the probability of a person dying between age (''x'') and age ''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1; this probability is called ''q''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. In the continuous case, we could also consider the [[conditional probability]] that a person who has attained age (''x'') will die between age (''x'') and age (''x''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;Δ''x'') as:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\Delta x}(x)=P(x&lt;X&lt;x+\Delta\;x\mid\;X&gt;x)=\frac{F_X(x+\Delta\;x)-F_X(x)}{(1-F_X(x))}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') is the [[cumulative distribution function]] of the continuous age-at-death [[random variable]], X. As Δ''x'' tends to zero, so does this probability in the continuous case. The approximate force of mortality is this probability divided by Δ''x''. If we let Δ''x'' tend to zero, we get the function for '''force of mortality''', denoted as ''μ''(''x''):

:&lt;math&gt;\mu\,(x)=\frac{F'_X(x)}{1-F_X(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

The '''anterior fornix erogenous zone''' (also known as the '''AFE zone''', '''AFE''', '''A-spot''', '''epicenter''', '''deep spot''' or '''second  [[G-spot]]''') is reportedly a female [[erogenous zone]] that when stimulated can lead to rapid [[vaginal lubrication]] and [[arousal]], sometimes without any other form of stimulation, with continued stimulation resulting in an intense [[orgasm]].

==Discovery==

===Early research===
The AFE zone concept is sometimes attributed to [[Malaysia]]n sex scientist Dr. Chua Chee Ann in 1989. In his research with [[women|female]] subjects suffering from [[vaginal dryness]] [https://www.confidentlovers.com/what-is-the-a-spot/], he found that stimulation of an area deep in the [[vagina]] on the [[anterior]] wall resulted in rapid lubrication and arousal. He did not make his discovery public until thirteen years after it was made.  However this location was described as an erogenous spot much earlier by [[Marie Stopes]] in her 1924 book "Contraception" &lt;ref&gt; * Stopes, Marie: Contraception (birth control), its theory, history and practice. London. John Bale, Sons &amp; Danielsson, limited, 1924.  p. 162.  Stopes locates the spot as "at the end of the vagina and near the cervix" and writes "These tissues are among the most sensitive of the woman and it is not good that they should be needlessly covered." (as they are by the [[Diaphragm (birth control) | diaphragm]] )&lt;/ref&gt;

===A-spot stimulation technique===
Dr. Chua Chee Ann has promoted his A-spot stimulation technique in books and at seminars as the most effective means of stimulating the AFE zone. The technique involves applying pressure to the area, making a scooping motion, and stimulating other parts of the vagina. He claims that if the technique is practiced for at least 10 minutes a day, it will make vaginal lubrication and orgasms regularly attainable, even without [[foreplay]].

==Location==

===Confusion===
The AFE zone is reported to be located at or near the [[Vaginal fornix|deepest point]] on the anterior wall of the [[vagina]], above the [[cervix]], where the anterior wall of the vagina starts to curve upward (the entrance to the [[vaginal fornix|anterior fornix]]), but some websites and news articles have described it as being on the posterior wall of the vagina, roughly opposite of the G-spot. Dr. Chua Chee Ann stated in an interview that this is completely wrong.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspot-pioneer.com/pdf/DrChuaInterviewScript.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Some believe that this area may be a different erogenous zone altogether.

===Connection to known female anatomy===
Some believe that the AFE zone is the anterior fornix itself, but it is thought by some sex experts to be a degenerated female [[prostate]] (a theory that has been applied to the G-spot and the [[Skene's gland]]) or the area where the vaginal nerves connect, which is thought to be near it. Speculation is that it is the [[vesicouterine pouch]], due to its proximity to the supposed location of the AFE zone and the supposed erogenous qualities of the [[rectouterine pouch]].

==Mechanism==

===Lubrication===
According to Dr. Chua Chee Ann, the AFE zone redirects female [[female ejaculation|ejaculatory fluid]], which is expelled from the Skene's gland during G-spot orgasms, and turns it into [[vaginal lubrication]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aspot-pioneer.com/pdf/DrChua-Aspot-Pioneer.com.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Because stimulating the AFE zone causes this mechanism and creates an erotic sensation simultaneously, full arousal occurs very quickly.

===Orgasm===
The orgasms that result from stimulation of the AFE zone are thought to be distinct from the orgasms that result from stimulation of the [[clitoris]], but some women who have experienced them say that they are similar in sensation to orgasms achieved by G-spot stimulation, while others say that they are more "intense".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23320">{{Anti-consumerism}}

'''Anti-consumerism''' is a [[sociopolitical]] [[ideology]] that is opposed to [[consumerism]], the continual buying and consuming of material possessions.  Anti-consumerism is concerned with the private actions of business corporations in pursuit of financial and economic goals at the expense of the public welfare, especially in matters of [[environmental protection]], [[social stratification]], and [[ethics]] in the governing of a society. In politics, anti-consumerism overlaps with [[environmental activism]], [[anti-globalization]], and [[animal-rights]] activism; moreover, a conceptual variation of anti-consumerism is ''[[post-consumerism]]'', living in a material way that transcends consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postconsumers.com |title=Postconsumers |publisher=Postconsumers |date=2018-06-13 |accessdate=2018-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-consumerism arose in response to the problems caused by the long-term mistreatment of human consumers and of the animals consumed, and from the incorporation of [[consumer education]] to school [[curriculum|curricula]]; examples of anti-consumerism are the book ''[[No Logo]]'' (2000) by [[Naomi Klein]], and documentary films such as ''[[The Corporation (2003 film)|The Corporation]]'' (2003), by [[Mark Achbar]] and [[Jennifer Abbott]], and ''[[Surplus (film)|Surplus: Terrorized into Being Consumers]]'' (2003), by [[Erik Gandini]]; each made [[anti-corporate activism]] popular as an ideologically accessible form of civil and political action.

The criticism of [[economic materialism]] as a dehumanizing behaviour that is destructive of the Earth, as [[biosphere|human habitat]], comes from [[religion]] and [[social activism]]. The religious criticism asserts that materialist consumerism interferes with the connection between the individual and God, and so is an inherently [[immoral]] style of life; thus the German historian [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936) said that "Life in America is exclusively economic in structure, and lacks depth."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Stearns, Peter. ''Consumerism in World History''. Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; From the Roman Catholic perspective, [[Thomas Aquinas]] said that "Greed is a sin against God, just as all mortal sins, in as much as man condemns things eternal for the sake of temporal things"; in that vein, [[Francis of Assisi]], [[Ammon Hennacy]], and [[Mohandas Gandhi]] said that spiritual inspiration guided them towards [[simple living]].

From the secular perspective, social activism indicates that from consumerist materialism derive [[crime]] (which originates from the [[poverty]] of [[economic inequality]]), industrial [[pollution]] and the consequent [[environmental degradation]], and [[war]] as a business. About the societal discontent born of [[malaise]] and [[hedonism]], [[Pope Benedict XVI]] said that the philosophy of materialism offers no ''[[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]]'' for human existence;&lt;ref&gt;Web log. 17 July 2008. http://babs22.wordpress.com/2008/07/17/australia-pope-attacks-consumerism/&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the writer [[Georges Duhamel]] said that "American materialism [is] a beacon of mediocrity that threatened to eclipse French civilization".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Background==
Anti-consumerism originated from criticism of consumption, starting with [[Thorstein Veblen]], who, in the book ''[[Theory of the Leisure Class|The Theory of the Leisure Class: An Economic Study of Institutions]]'' (1899), indicated that [[consumerism]] dates from the [[cradle of civilization]]. The term ''consumerism'' also denotes economic policies associated with [[Keynesian economics]], and the belief that the free choice of consumers should dictate the economic structure of a society (cf. [[producerism]]).

==Politics and society==
[[File:Anticonsumismo.JPG|thumb|250px|An anti-consumerist [[stencil graffiti]] saying "Consuming consumes you"]]
Many [[anti-corporate activist]]s believe the rise of large-business corporations poses a threat to the legitimate authority of [[nation states]] and the public sphere.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} They feel corporations are invading people's [[privacy]], manipulating politics and governments, and creating false needs in consumers.  They state evidence such as invasive advertising [[adware]], [[spam (electronic)|spam]], [[telemarketing]], child-targeted advertising, aggressive [[guerrilla marketing]], massive corporate campaign contributions in political elections, interference in the policies of sovereign nation states ([[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]), and news stories about [[corporate corruption]] ([[Enron]], for example).{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Anti-consumerism protesters point out that the main responsibility of a corporation is to answer only to [[shareholders]], giving [[human rights]] and other issues almost no consideration.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} The management does have a primary responsibility to their shareholders, since any [[philanthropic]] activities that do not directly serve the business could be deemed to be a [[Position of trust|breach of trust]].  This sort of financial responsibility means that multi-national corporations will pursue strategies to intensify labor and reduce costs. For example, they will attempt to find low wage economies with laws which are conveniently lenient on human rights, the [[natural environment]], [[trade union]] organization and so on (see, for example, [[Nike, Inc.#Human rights concerns|Nike]]).

An important contribution to the critique of consumerism has been made by French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]], arguing modern capitalism is governed by consumption rather than production, and the advertising techniques used to create [[consumer behaviour]] amount to the destruction of psychic and collective [[individuation]].  The diversion of libidinal energy toward the consumption of consumer products, he argues, results in an addictive cycle of consumption, leading to hyper consumption, the exhaustion of desire, and the reign of symbolic misery.

In art, [[Banksy]], influential British graffiti master, painter, activist, filmmaker and all-purpose provocateur&lt;ref name="Kakutani"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/books/banksy-the-man-behind-the-wall-by-will-ellsworth-jones.html|title=‘Banksy: The Man Behind the Wall,’ by Will Ellsworth-Jones|last=Kakutani|first=Michiko|date=2013-02-17|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-03-16|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; has made statements in public works about the consumerist society. Working undercover, the secretive street artist challenges social ideas and goads viewers into rethinking their surroundings, to acknowledge the absurdities of closely held preconceptions.&lt;ref name="Kakutani"/&gt; Quote from Banksy: “You owe the companies nothing. Less than nothing, you especially don’t owe them any courtesy. They owe you. They have re-arranged the world to put themselves in front of you. They never asked for your permission, don’t even start asking for theirs.” After 2003, Banksy wrote the ''New Yorker'' by e-mail: “I give away thousands of paintings for free. I don’t think it’s possible to make art about world poverty and trouser all the cash.” Banksy believes that there is a consumerist shift in art, and for the first time, the bourgeois world of art belongs to the people. On his [http://www.banksy.co.uk/menu.asp website], he provides high-resolution images of his work for free downloading.

In many critical contexts,{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} the term describes the tendency of people to identify strongly with products or services they consume, especially with commercial [[brand]] names and obvious [[status symbol|status-enhancing]] appeal, such as a brand of expensive automobiles or [[jewelry]]. It is a pejorative term which most people deny, having some more specific excuse or [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]] for consumption other than the idea that they are "compelled to consume". A culture that has a high amount of consumerism is referred to as a [[consumer culture]].

To those who embrace the idea of consumerism, these products are not seen as valuable in themselves, but rather as social signals that allow them to identify like-minded people through consumption and display of similar products. Few would yet go so far, though, as to admit that their relationships with a product or brand name could be substitutes for healthy human relationships that sometimes lack in a dysfunctional modern [[society]].

The older term ''conspicuous consumption'' described the [[United States]] in the 1960s, but was soon linked to larger debates about [[media influence]], [[culture jamming]], and its corollary [[productivism]]. 
[[File:BarsStencil.jpg|thumb|Anti-consumerist [[stencil]] art]]
The term and concept of ''conspicuous consumption'' originated at the turn of the 20th century in the writing of economist [[Thorstein Veblen]]. The term describes an apparently irrational and confounding form of economic behaviour. Veblen's scathing proposal that this unnecessary consumption is a form of status display is made in darkly humorous observations like the following:
{{quote |It is true of dress in even a higher degree than of most other items of consumption, that people will undergo a very considerable degree of privation in the comforts or the necessaries of life in order to afford what is considered a decent amount of wasteful consumption; so that it is by no means an uncommon occurrence, in an inclement climate, for people to go ill clad in order to appear well dressed.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Theory of the Leisure Class]], 1899&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1955, economist [[Victor Lebow]] stated (as quoted by [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]], 2009):
{{quote |Our enormously productive economy demands that we make consumption our way of life, that we convert the buying and use of goods into rituals, that we seek our spiritual satisfaction and our ego satisfaction in consumption. We need things consumed, burned up, worn out, replaced and discarded at an ever-increasing rate.}}

According to archaeologists, evidence of conspicuous consumption up to several millennia ago has been found, suggesting that such behavior is inherent to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Consumerism and advertising===
Anti-consumerists believe [[advertising]] plays a huge role in human life by informing values and assumptions of the cultural system, deeming what is acceptable and determining social standards.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"&gt;[ Advertising and the End of the World. Dir. Sut Jhally. Perf. [[Sut Jhally]]. DVD. Media Education Foundation, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;  They declare that ads create a hyper-real world where commodities appear as the key to securing happiness.  Anti-consumerists cite studies that find that individuals believe their quality of life improves in relation to social values that lie outside the capability of the market place.  Therefore, advertising attempts to equate the social with the material by utilizing images and slogans to link commodities with the real sources of human happiness, such as meaningful relationships.  Ads are then a detriment to society because they tell consumers that accumulating more and more possessions will bring them closer to self-actualization, or the concept of a complete and secure being.  "The underlying message is that owning these products will enhance our image and ensure our popularity with others".&lt;ref&gt;[Tim Kasser, "The High Price of Materialism", 2002, p.9, Achorn Graphic Services]&lt;/ref&gt; And while advertising promises that a product will make the consumer happy, advertising simultaneously depends upon the consumer never being ''truly'' happy, as then the consumer would no longer feel the need to consume needless products.

Anti-consumerists claim that in a consumerist society, advertisement images disempower and objectify the consumer.&lt;ref name="Rumbo"&gt;Joseph D. Rumbo, "Consumer Resistance in a World of Advertising Clutter: The Case of Adbusters", Psychology and Marketing, Vol.19(2), February 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  By stressing individual power, choice and desire, advertising falsely implies the control lies with the consumer.  Because anti-consumerists believe commodities only supply short-term gratification, they detract from a sustainably happy society.  Further, advertisers have resorted to new techniques of capturing attention, such as the increased speed of ads and [[product placement]]s.&lt;ref name="World. Dir 1997"/&gt;  In this way, commercials infiltrate the consumerist society and become an inextricable part of culture.  Anti-consumerists condemn advertising because it constructs a simulated world that offers fantastical [[escapism]] to consumers, rather than reflecting actual reality.  They further argue that ads depict the interests and lifestyles of the elite as natural; cultivating a deep sense of inadequacy among viewers.&lt;ref name="Rumbo" /&gt;  They denounce use of beautiful models because they glamorize the commodity beyond reach of the average individual.

In an opinion segment of ''[[New Scientist]]'' magazine published in August 2009, reporter Andy Coghlan cited [[William E. Rees (academic)|William Rees]] of the [[University of British Columbia]] and [[Epidemiology|epidemiologist]] [[Warren Hern]] of the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], saying that human beings, despite considering themselves civilized thinkers, are "subconsciously still driven by an impulse for survival, domination and expansion... an impulse which now finds expression in the idea that inexorable economic growth is the answer to everything, and, given time, will redress all the world's existing inequalities." According to figures presented by Rees at the annual meeting of the [[Ecological Society of America]], human society is in a "global overshoot", consuming 30% more material than is sustainable from the world's resources. Rees went on to state that at present, 85 countries are exceeding their domestic "bio-capacities", and compensate for their lack of local material by depleting the stocks of other countries.

===Alternatives to mainstream economic concepts===
{{confusing|section|date=August 2013}}
Throughout the ages, various movements have tried to model alternatives to consumerism while remaining in the capitalist society. [[Intentional community|Intentional communities]] provide an example of this, as do monastic orders, barter movements and technology-driving sharing or exchange mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof - Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2017-11-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, an intentional community called the Bruderhof has a system of sharing within the community, and no money is used by the members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/FastFeatures/bruderhof-christians-beliefs-set/2015/05/07/id/643320/|title=5 Beliefs That Set the Bruderhof Apart From Other Christians|work=Newsmax|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bruderhof runs a successful manufacturing business that allows it to trade in the capitalistic society, but without the members indulging in consumerism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.communityplaythings.com/about-us/history|title=communityplaythings.com - Our History|website=www.communityplaythings.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such anti-consumerist, anti-capitalist notions are not without their detractors. New thought and theory has spurred movements to alter world economic climate. Green movements and some other thinkers are opposed to the focus put on economics. The need for terminology has created familiar ideas such as [[carrying-capacity]], and [[ecological footprint]].

[[David Ricardo]], an early economist, had ideas that state the finitude of growth, rather than the opposite; his ideas were similar to those of [[Mark Twain]], when he said "Buy land, they don't make it anymore." To Ricardian logic, land was a limiting factor.

==Austrian economics==

Some{{who|date=December 2017}} adherents to the Austrian economic philosophy advocate against consumerism due to its effect of contributing to "debt slavery." Austrian economic advocates focus on the entrepreneur, promoting a productive lifestyle rather than a materialistic one wherein the individual is defined by things and not himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/library/consumerism-defense|title=Consumerism: A Defense - Tibor R. Machan|first=|last=kanopiadmin|date=27 October 2000|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Many{{who|date=October 2015}} have accused anti-consumerists of opposing [[modernity]] or [[utilitarianism]]. Right-wing critics see anti-consumerism as rooted in socialism. In 1999, the [[Right-libertarianism|right-libertarian]] magazine [[Reason (magazine)|''Reason'']] attacked anti-consumerism, claiming [[marxism|Marxist]] academics are repackaging themselves as anti-consumerists. [[James B. Twitchell]], a professor at the [[University of Florida]] and popular writer, referred to anti-consumerist arguments as "Marxism Lite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Twitchell |first1=James B. |title=In Praise of Consumerism |date=August 2000 |website=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |url=http://www.reason.com/news/show/27795.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been socialist critics of anti-consumerism who see it as a form of anti-modern "reactionary socialism", and state that anti-consumerism has also been adopted by ultra-conservatives and [[fascism|fascists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Varul |first1=Matthias Zick |title=Towards a consumerist critique of capitalism: A socialist defence of consumer culture |journal=Ephemera: Theory &amp; Politics in Organization |volume=13 |issue=2 |pages=293–315 |date=May 2013 |url=http://www.ephemerajournal.org/contribution/towards-consumerist-critique-capitalism-socialist-defence-consumer-culture |issn=1473-2866 |isbn=9781906948177 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular media==
In [[Fight Club]], the protagonist, finds himself participating in terroristic acts against corporate society and consumer culture.

In [[Mr. Robot]], Elliot Anderson, a young cybersecurity engineer, joins a hacker group known as fsociety, which aims to crash the U.S. economy, eliminating all debt.

In the novel [[American Psycho]] by [[Bret Easton Ellis]], the protagonist Patrick Bateman criticizes the consumerist society of America in the 1980s of which he is a personification. Later on he goes on a killing spree  without any consequences, suggesting that the people around him are so self-absorbed and focused on consuming that they either don't see or don't care about his acts.

The '''arabesque''' is a form of artistic decoration consisting of "surface decorations based on rhythmic linear patterns of scrolling and interlacing foliage, tendrils" or plain lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fleming, John |author2=Honour, Hugh |title=Dictionary of the Decorative Arts |year=1977 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-670-82047-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; often combined with other elements. Another definition is "Foliate ornament, used in the Islamic world, typically using leaves, derived from stylised [[half-palmette]]s, which were combined with spiralling stems".&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 236&lt;/ref&gt;  It usually consists of a single design which can be '[[tessellation|tiled]]' or seamlessly repeated as many times as desired.&lt;ref name=Robinson&gt;{{cite book |author=Robinson, Francis |title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-521-66993-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the very wide range of [[Eurasia]]n decorative art that includes [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s matching this basic definition, the term "arabesque" is used consistently as a technical term by [[history of art|art historians]] to describe only elements of the decoration found in two phases: [[Islamic art]] from about the 9th century onwards, and European decorative art from the [[Renaissance]] onwards. [[Interlace (art)|Interlace]] and [[Scroll (art)|scroll]] decoration are terms used for most other types of similar patterns.

Arabesques are a fundamental element of Islamic art but they develop what was already a long tradition by the coming of Islam. The past and current usage of the term in respect of European art can only be described as confused and inconsistent. Some Western arabesques derive from Islamic art, but others are closely based on [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] decorations. In the West they are essentially found in the [[decorative arts]], but because of the generally non-figurative nature of Islamic art, arabesque decoration is there often a very prominent element in the most significant works, and plays a large part in the decoration of [[Islamic architecture|architecture]].

Claims are often made regarding the theological significance of the arabesque, and its origin in a specifically Islamic view of the world; however these are without support from written historical sources as, like most medieval cultures, the Islamic world has not left us documentation of their intentions in using the decorative motifs they did.  At the popular level such theories often appear uninformed as to the wider context of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;  In similar fashion, proposed connections between the arabesque and Arabic knowledge of [[geometry]] remains a subject of debate; not all art historians are persuaded that such knowledge had reached, or was needed by, those creating arabesque designs, although in certain cases there is evidence that such a connection did exist.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 88&lt;/ref&gt;  The case for a connection with [[Islamic mathematics]] is much stronger for the development of the [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] with which arabesques are often combined in art.  Geometric decoration often uses patterns that are made up of straight lines and regular angles that somewhat resemble curvilinear arabesque patterns; the extent to which these too are described as arabesque varies between different writers.&lt;ref&gt;Canby, 20-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Arabesque is a French term that derived from the Italian word Arabesco, and it means Arabic style. 

The development of this and related terms in the main European languages is complicated, and described in "Western arabesque" below.

== Islamic arabesque ==
The arabesque developed out of the long-established traditions of plant-based [[scroll (art)|scroll]] ornament in the cultures taken over by the early [[Islamic conquests]].  Early Islamic art, for example in the famous 8th century [[mosaic]]s of the [[Umayyad Mosque|Great Mosque of Damascus]], often contained plant-scroll patterns, in that case by Byzantine artists in their usual style.  The plants most often used are stylized versions of the [[Acanthus mollis|acanthus]], with its emphasis on leafy forms, and the vine, with an equal emphasis on twining stems.  The evolution of these forms into a distinctive Islamic type was complete by the 11th century, having begun in the 8th or 9th century in works like the [[Mshatta Facade]]. In the process of development the plant forms became increasing simplified and stylized.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 75-88; Canby, 26&lt;/ref&gt;  The relatively abundant survivals of [[stucco]] [[relief]]s from the walls of palaces (but not mosques) in [[Abbasid Samarra]], the Islamic capital between 836 and 892, provide examples of three styles, Styles A, B, and C, though more than one of these may appear on the same wall, and their chronological sequence is not certain.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, Gülru, Payne, Alina, ''Histories of Ornament: From Global to Local'', 88-90, 2016, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0691167281}}, 978069116728, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9nACCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA88 google books]; [https://depts.washington.edu/silkroad/museums/mik/miksamarra.html "Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin: Objects from Samarra"]; Ettinghausen et al, 57-59; examples of styles A,B, and C illustrated.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Though the broad outline of the process is generally agreed, there is a considerable  diversity of views held by specialist scholars on detailed issues concerning the development, categorization and meaning of the arabesque.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa's Chapter 4 gives an overview of these questions.&lt;/ref&gt;  The detailed study of Islamic arabesque forms was begun by [[Alois Riegl]] in his [[formalism (art)|formalist]] study ''[[Stilfragen|Stilfragen: Grundlegungen zu einer Geschichte der Ornamentik]]'' (''Problems of style: foundations for a history of ornament'') of 1893, who in the process developed his influential concept of the ''Kunstwollen''.&lt;ref&gt;Tabbaa, 74-75&lt;/ref&gt;  Riegl traced formalistic continuity and development in decorative plant forms from [[ancient Egyptian art]] and other ancient Near Eastern civilizations through the classical world to the Islamic arabesque.  While the ''Kunstwollen'' has few followers today, his basic analysis of the development of forms has been confirmed and refined by the wider ''corpus'' of examples known today.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, 24-25; see also [http://www.newcriterion.com/articles.cfm/-8220-Style-8221-151-or-whatever-4745 "“Style”—or whatever", J. Duncan Berry], A review of ''Problems of Style'' by Alois Riegl, ''[[The New Criterion]]'', April 1993&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jessica Rawson]] has recently extended the analysis to cover [[Chinese art]], which Riegl did not cover, tracing many elements of Chinese decoration back to the same tradition; the shared background helping to make the assimilation of Chinese motifs into Persian art after the [[History of Iran#Mongol invasion .281219.E2.80.931221.29|Mongol invasion]] harmonious and productive.&lt;ref&gt;Rawson, the subject of her book, see Preface, and Chapter 5 on Chinese influences on Persian art.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many arabesque patterns disappear at (or "under" as it often appears to a viewer) a framing edge without ending, and thus can be regarded as infinitely extendable outside the space they actually occupy; this was certainly a distinctive feature of the Islamic form, though not without precedent.  Most but not all foliage decoration in the preceding cultures terminated at the edge of the occupied space, although infinitely repeatable patterns in foliage are very common in the modern world in [[wallpaper]] and [[textile]]s.

Typically, in earlier forms there is no attempt at realism; no particular species of plant is being imitated, and the forms are often botanically impossible or implausible. "Leaf" forms typically spring sideways from the stem, in what is often called a "half-[[palmette]]" form, named after its distant and very different looking ancestor in ancient Egyptian and Greek ornament.  New stems spring from leaf-tips, a type often called [[honeysuckle]], and the stems often have no tips, winding endlessly out of the space.  The early [[Mshatta Facade]] is recognisably some sort of vine, with conventional leaves on the end of short stalks and bunches of grapes or berries, but later forms usually lack these.  Flowers are rare until about 1500, after which they appear more often, especially in Ottoman art, and are often identifiable by species.  In Ottoman art the large and feathery leaves called ''saz'' became very popular, and were elaborated in drawings showing just one or more large leaves.  Eventually floral decoration mostly derived from Chinese styles, especially those of [[Chinese porcelain]], replaces the arabesque in many types of work, such as pottery, textiles and miniatures.

=== Significance in Islam ===

[[File:Alhambra (038).jpg|thumb|upright|Three modes: Arabesques, [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] and [[Islamic calligraphy|calligraphy]] used together in the [[Court of the Myrtles]], [[Alhambra]].]]

The arabesques and [[Islamic geometric patterns|geometric patterns]] of Islamic art are often said to arise from the [[Islam]]ic view of the world (see above). The [[Aniconism in Islam|depiction of animals and people is generally discouraged]], which explains the preference for abstract geometric patterns.

There are two modes to arabesque art. The first recalls the principles that govern the order of the world. These principles include the bare basics of what makes objects structurally sound and, by extension, beautiful (i.e. the angle and the fixed/static shapes that it creates—esp. the [[truss]]). In the first mode, each repeating geometric form has a built-in symbolism ascribed to it. For example, the square, with its four [[equilateral]] sides, is symbolic of the equally important elements of nature: [[soil|earth]], [[air]], [[fire]] and [[water]]. Without any one of the four, the physical world, represented by a circle that inscribes the square, would collapse upon itself and cease to exist. The second mode is based upon the flowing nature of [[plant]] forms. This mode recalls the [[female|feminine]] nature of life giving. In addition, upon inspection of the many examples of Arabesque art, some would argue that there is in fact a third mode, the mode of [[Islamic calligraphy]].

Instead of recalling something related to the 'True Reality' (the reality of the spiritual world), Islam considers [[calligraphy]] a visible expression of the highest art of all; the art of the spoken word (the transmittal of thoughts and of history). In Islam, the most important document to be transmitted orally is the [[Qur'an]]. [[Proverb]]s and complete passages from the Qur'an can be seen today in Arabesque art. The coming together of these three forms creates the Arabesque, and this is a reflection of unity arising from diversity; a basic tenet of Islam.

The arabesque may be equally thought of as both [[art]] and [[science]]. The artwork is at the same time [[mathematical]]ly precise, aesthetically pleasing, and symbolic. Due to this duality of creation, the artistic part of this equation may be further subdivided into both [[secular]] and [[religious]] artwork. However, for many Muslims there is no distinction; all forms of art, the natural world, mathematics and science are seen to be creations of God and therefore reflections of the same thing: God's will expressed through his creation. In other words, man can discover the geometric forms that constitute the arabesque, but these forms always existed before as part of God's creation, as shown in this picture.

There is great similarity between arabesque artwork from very different geographic regions.&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wade |first1=David |title=The Evolution of Style |url=http://patterninislamicart.com/background-notes/the-evolution-of-style |website=Pattern in Islamic Art |accessdate=19 December 2015 |date=March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the similarities are so pronounced that it is sometimes difficult for experts to tell where a given style of arabesque comes from. The reason for this is that the science and mathematics that are used to construct Arabesque artwork are universal. Therefore, for most Muslims, the best artwork that can be created by man for use in the [[Mosque]] is artwork that displays the underlying order and unity of nature. The order and unity of the material world, they believe, is a mere [[ghost]]ly approximation of the [[spirit]]ual world, which for many Muslims is the place where the only true reality exists. Discovered geometric forms, therefore, exemplify this perfect reality because God's creation has been obscured by the [[sin]]s of man.

Mistakes in repetitions may be intentionally introduced as a show of humility by artists who believe only Allah can produce perfection, although this theory is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Islamic Textile Art: Anomalies in Kilims |author=Thompson, Muhammad |author2=Begum, Nasima |url=http://www.turkotek.com/salon_00101/salon.html |work=Salon du Tapis d'Orient |publisher=TurkoTek |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The future of art in a digital age: from Hellenistic to Hebraic consciousness |last=Alexenberg |first=Melvin L. |year=2006 |publisher=Intellect Ltd |isbn=1-84150-136-0 |page=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Only God is Perfect |url=http://www.geometricdesign.co.uk/perfect.htm |work=Islamic and Geometric Art |author=Backhouse, Tim |accessdate=25 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Arabesque art consists of a series of repeating geometric forms which are occasionally accompanied by [[calligraphy]]. Ettinghausen et al. describe the arabesque as a "vegetal design consisting of full...and half [[palmette]]s [as] an unending continuous pattern...in which each leaf grows out of the tip of another."&lt;ref&gt;Ettinghausen et al, 66.&lt;/ref&gt; To the adherents of [[Islam]], the Arabesque is symbolic of their united faith and the way in which traditional Islamic cultures view the world.

==Western arabesque==
[[File:Tapis de Savonnerie Louis XIV apres Charles Le Brun pour la Grande Galerie du Louvre.jpg|thumb|The French sense of arabesque: [[Savonnerie]] carpet after [[Charles Le Brun]] for the ''Grande Galerie'' of the [[Louvre]].]]
[[File:Царское-село,-Екатерининский-дворец.jpg|thumb|What is called the "Arabesque Room" in the [[Catherine Palace]], with [[neoclassicism|neoclassical]] [[grotesque]] decoration.|221x221px]]
The term arabesque was first used in the West in [[Italian language|Italian]], where ''rabeschi'' was used in the 16th century as a term for "[[pilaster]] ornaments featuring [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus]] decoration",&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"&gt;Osborne, 34&lt;/ref&gt; specifically "running scrolls" that ran vertically up a panel or pilaster, rather than horizontally along a [[frieze]].&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 159&lt;/ref&gt;  The book ''Opera nuova che insegna a le donne a cuscire … laqual e intitolata Esempio di raccammi'' (A New Work that Teaches Women how to Sew … Entitled "Samples of Embroidery"), published in Venice in 1530, includes "groppi moreschi e rabeschi", Moorish knots and arabesques.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/35.75.3 Met Museum]; the Italian word uses the Latin derived "inceptive" or "inchoative" word ending "-esco" signifying a beginning, thus ''ferveo'', to boil and ''fervesco'' to begin to boil.&lt;/ref&gt;

From there it spread to England, where [[Henry VIII]] owned, in an inventory of 1549, an [[agate]] cup with a "fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]], "Arabesque":"1549 Inventory Henry VIII (1998) 25/2 Item one Cuppe of Agathe the fote and Couer of siluer and guilt enbossed with Rebeske worke";&lt;/ref&gt; and William Herne or Heron, [[Serjeant Painter]] from 1572 to 1580, was paid for painting Elizabeth I's barge with "rebeske work".&lt;ref&gt;"rebeske" being a now disused version of "arabesque", see OED, "Rebesk". Herne payment quoted in [[Erna Auerbach]], ''Tudor Artists'', 1954; not in print OED&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately the styles so described can only be guessed at, although the design by [[Hans Holbein the younger|Hans Holbein]] for a covered cup for [[Jane Seymour]] in 1536 (see gallery) already has zones in both Islamic-derived arabesque/moresque style (see below) and classically derived [[acanthus (ornament)|acanthus volutes]].&lt;ref name=marks&gt;Marks, Richard and Williamson, Paul, eds. ''Gothic: Art for England 1400-1547'', 156, 2003, V&amp;A Publications, London, {{ISBN|1-85177-401-7}}.  For other Renaissance ornament from Henry's court, see also no 13 on page 156, and pp. 144-145, 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related term is [[moresque]], meaning "[[Moors|Moorish]]"; [[Randle Cotgrave]]'s ''A Dictionarie of the French and English Tongues'' of 1611 defines this as: "a rude or anticke painting, or carving, wherin the feet and tayles of beasts, &amp;c, are intermingled with, or made to resemble, a kind of wild leaves, &amp;c."&lt;ref&gt;OED, "Moresque", citing Cotgrave&lt;/ref&gt; and "arabesque", in its earliest use cited in the [[OED]] (but as a French word), as "Rebeske work; a small and curious flourishing".&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"&gt;OED, "Arabesque"&lt;/ref&gt;  In France "arabesque" first appears in 1546,&lt;ref&gt;Larrouse dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; and "was first applied in the latter part of the 17th century" to [[grotesque]] ornament, "despite the classical origin of the latter", especially if without human figures in it - a distinction still often made, but not consistently observed,&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34 (quoted), see also [[OED]] quoted below and Cotgrave - Osborne says the French usage begins in the "latter part of the 17th century" but in the following paragraphs describes a development beginning rather before this.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following centuries the three terms grotesque, moresque and arabesque were used largely interchangeably in English, French and German for styles of decoration derived at least as much from the European past as the Islamic world, with "grotesque" gradually acquiring its main modern meaning, related more to Gothic [[gargoyle]]s and [[caricature]] than to either [[Pompeii]]-style Roman painting or Islamic patterns.  Meanwhile, the word "arabesque" was now being applied to Islamic art itself, by 1851 at the latest, when [[John Ruskin]] uses it in ''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Stones of Venice (book)|The Stones of Venice]]'', [http://www.victorianweb.org/authors/ruskin/sov/1.html chapter 1, para 26]&lt;/ref&gt;  Writers over the last decades have attempted to salvage meaningful distinctions between the words from the confused wreckage of historical sources.

Peter Fuhring, a specialist in the history of ornament, says that (also in a French context): &lt;blockquote&gt;The ornament known as moresque in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (but now more commonly called arabesque) is characterized by bifurcated scrolls composed of branches forming interlaced foliage patterns.  These basic motifs gave rise to numerous variants, for example, where the branches, generally of a linear character, were turned into straps or bands. ... It is characteristic of the moresque, which is essentially a surface ornament, that it is impossible to locate the pattern's beginning or end. ... Originating in the Middle East, they were introduced to continental Europe via Italy and Spain ... Italian examples of this ornament, which was often used for bookbindings and embroidery, are known from as early as the late fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 162&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fuhring notes that grotesques were "confusingly called arabesques in eighteenth century France", but in his terminology "the major types of ornament that appear in French sixteenth century etchings and engraving... can be divided into two groups. The first includes ornaments adopted from antiquity: grotesques, architectural ornaments such as the orders, foliage scrolls and self-contained elements such as trophies, terms and vases. A second group, far smaller than the first, comprises modern ornaments: moresques, interlaced bands, strapwork, and elements such as cartouches...", categories he goes on to discuss individually.&lt;ref&gt;Fuhring, 155-156&lt;/ref&gt;

The moresque or arabesque style was especially popular and long-lived in the Western arts of the book: [[bookbinding]]s decorated in gold tooling, borders for illustrations, and printer's ornaments for decorating empty spaces on the page. In this field the technique of gold tooling had also arrived in the 15th century from the Islamic world, and indeed much of the leather itself was imported from there.&lt;ref&gt;Harthan, 10-12&lt;/ref&gt;  Small motifs in this style have continued to be used by conservative book designers up to the present day.

According to Harold Osborne, in France, the "characteristic development of the French arabesque combined bandwork deriving from the moresque with decorative acanthus foliage radiating from C-scrolls connected by short bars".&lt;ref name="Osborne, 34"/&gt; Apparently starting in [[embroidery]], it then appears in garden design before being used in [[Northern Mannerist]] painted decorative schemes "with a central medallion combined with acanthus and other forms" by [[Simon Vouet]] and then [[Charles Lebrun]] who used "scrolls of flat bandwork joined by horizontal bars and contrasting with ancanthus scrolls and [[palmette]]."&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 34-35&lt;/ref&gt; More exuberant arabesque designs by [[Jean Bérain the Elder]] are an early "intimation" of the [[Rococo]], which was to take the arabesque into three dimensions in reliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of "arabesque" as an English noun first appears, in relation to painting, in [[William Thomas Beckford|William Beckford]]'s novel ''[[Vathek]]'' in 1786.&lt;ref name="OED, Arabesque"/&gt;
Arabesque is also used as a term for complex freehand pen flourishes in drawing or other graphic media. The ''[[Grove Dictionary of Art]]'' will have none of this confusion, and says flatly: "Over the centuries the word has been applied to a wide variety of winding and twining vegetal decoration in art and meandering themes in music, but it properly applies only to Islamic art",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Art Online]], "Arabesque", accessed March 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; so contradicting the definition of 1888 still found in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'': "A species of mural or surface decoration in colour or low relief, composed in flowing lines of branches, leaves, and scroll-work fancifully intertwined. Also fig[uratively]. As used in Moorish and Arabic decorative art (from which, almost exclusively, it was known in the Middle Ages), representations of living creatures were excluded; but in the arabesques of [[Raphael]], founded on the ancient Græco-Roman work of this kind, and in those of Renaissance decoration, human and animal figures, both natural and grotesque, as well as vases, armour, and objects of art, are freely introduced; to this the term is now usually applied, the other being distinguished as Moorish Arabesque, or Moresque."&lt;ref&gt;OED, printed and online editions (accessed March 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printing==
A major use of the arabesque style has been artistic printing, for example of book covers and page decoration. Repeating geometric patterns worked well with traditional printing, since they could be printed from metal type like letters if the type was placed together; as the designs have no specific connection to the meaning of a text, the type can be reused in many different editions of different works. [[Robert Granjon]], a French printer of the sixteenth century, has been credited with the first truly interlocking arabesque printing, but other printers had used many other kinds of ornaments in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Decorative ornaments and alphabets of the Renaissance : 1,020 copyright-free motifs from printed sources|date=1991|publisher=Dover Publications|location=New York|isbn=9780486266053}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was rapidly used by many other printers.&lt;ref name="Hoefler Text: Arabesques"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hoefler Text: Arabesques|url=http://www.typography.com/fonts/hoefler-text/features/hoefler-text-arabesques-patterns|publisher=Hoefler &amp; Frere-Jones|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="English printers' ornaments"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Plomer|first1=Henry R.|title=English printers' ornaments|date=1924|publisher=Martino Pub.|location=Mansfield Center, CT|isbn=9781578987153|url=https://archive.org/details/englishprinterso00plom|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Historic Design in Printing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Henry Lewis|title=Historic Design in Printing|date=1923|publisher=Graphic Arts Company|location=Boston, MA|url=https://archive.org/details/historicdesignin00john|accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a period of disuse in the nineteenth century, when a more minimal page layout became popular with printers like [[Giambattista Bodoni|Bodoni]] and [[Firmin Didot|Didot]], the concept returned to popularity with the arrival of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], Many fine books from the period 1890-1960 have arabesque decorations, sometimes on paperback covers.&lt;ref name="The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brandt|first1=Beverly K.|title=The craftsman and the critic : defining usefulness and beauty in arts and crafts-era Boston|date=2009|publisher=University of Massachusetts Press|location=Amherst|isbn=9781558496774|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many digital [[serif font]]s include arabesque pattern elements thought to be complementary to the mood of the font; they are also often sold as separate designs.&lt;ref name="Moresque 2D"&gt;{{cite web |title=Moresque 2D |url=http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/2d-typo/moreske-2d/ |website=MyFonts |accessdate=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Arcana Cœlestia, quae in Scriptura Sacra seu Verbo Domini sunt, detecta''''', usually abbreviated as ''Arcana Cœlestia'' (''Heavenly Mysteries'' or ''Secrets of Heaven'') or under its Latin variant, ''Arcana Cælestia'',&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [https://books.google.com/books?id=aRh1P-H8Q7sC&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=swedenborg+Arcana+Caelestia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y5kpqudrye&amp;sig=yFc493-L8_U85q_cKcrR4cJhOO0&amp;hl=fr&amp;ei=kOnbTNzkDYSDhQe7h7nPAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBYQ6AEwADgy#v=onepage&amp;q=swedenborg%20Arcana%20Caelestia&amp;f=false Michelle Grier, 'Swedenborg and Kant on Spiritual Intuition'] in ''On the True Philosopher: Essays on Swedenborg'', ed. Stephen McNeilly (London: Swedenborg Society, 2002), p. 1. Accessed November 11, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; is the first and largest work published by [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] in his theological period. It was written and published in [[New Latin language|Neo-Latin]], in eight volumes, one volume per year, from 1749 to 1756.&lt;ref&gt;In the standard edition of the ''Arcana Coelestia'', revised and edited by Rev. John Faulkner Potts and published by the Swedenborg Foundation in 1956, the prefatory notes by the reviser contains a summary of the publishing history for the work originally published by Swedenborg.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arcana Caelestia 0001.jpg|right|thumb|''Arcana Cœlestia'', first edition (1749), title page]] 

It consists of an exposition of the spiritual sense of the books of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], according to the doctrine of [[correspondence (theology)]], and demonstrated by many supporting quotations from the [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]]. While not denying the historicity of the stories of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)]] and [[The Exodus]] from Egypt, it explains them as describing symbolically the process of spiritual growth and struggles in each individual person.

What follows is the opening paragraph of ''Arcana Coelestia'' Volume 1, and therefore the opening statement of the whole corpus of theological work that Swedenborg claimed was revealed to him.&lt;ref&gt;https://newchristianbiblestudy.org/swedenborg/&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation| From the mere letter of the Word of the Old Testament no one would ever discern the fact that this part of the Word contains deep secrets of heaven, and that everything within it both in general and in particular bears reference to the Lord, to His heaven, to the church, to religious belief, and to all things connected therewith; for from the letter or sense of the letter all that anyone can see is that ̶  to speak generally ̶  everything therein has reference merely to the external rites and ordinances of the Jewish Church. Yet the truth is that everywhere in that Word there are internal things which never appear at all in the external things except a very few which the Lord revealed and explained to the Apostles; such as that the sacrifices signify the Lord; that the land of Canaan and Jerusalem signify heaven ̶  on which account they are called the Heavenly Canaan and Jerusalem  ̶  and that Paradise has a similar signification. (Arcana Cœlestia #1)|}}

[[File:Algae hydrogen production.jpg|thumb|Microbial hydrogen production.]]
'''Biohydrogen''' is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that is produced biologically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biohydrogen|editor=M. Rögner|year=2015|publisher=De Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-033673-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Interest is high in this technology because H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a clean fuel and can be readily produced from certain kinds of biomass.&lt;ref&gt;Y.-H. Percival Zhang "Hydrogen Production from Carbohydrates: A Mini-Review" in "Sustainable Production of Fuels, Chemicals, and Fibers from Forest Biomass" ACS Symposium Series, 2011, Volume 1067, pages=203-216.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many challenges characterize this technology, including those intrinsic to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, such as storage and transportation of a noncondensible gas.  Hydrogen producing organisms are poisoned by O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Yields of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are often low.

==Biochemical principles==
The main reactions involve [[fermentation]] of sugars.  Important reactions start with [[glucose]], which is converted to [[acetic acid]]:&lt;ref&gt;Thauer, R. K., "Biochemistry of Methanogenesis: a Tribute to Marjory Stephenson", Microbiology 1998, 144, 2377-2406.  {{DOI|10.1099/00221287-144-9-2377}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
A related reaction gives [[formate]] instead of [[carbon dioxide]]:
:C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O   →  2 CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 HCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H  +  2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
These reactions are exergonic by 216 and 209 kcal/mol, respectively.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production is catalyzed by two [[hydrogenase]]s.  One is called [FeFe]-hydrogenase; the other is called [NiFe]-hydrogenase.  Many organisms express these enzymes.  Notable examples are members of the genera [[Clostridium]], [[Desulfovibrio]], [[Ralstonia]], and the pathogen ''[[Helicobacter]]''.  ''[[E. coli]]'' is the workhorse for genetic engineering of hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Cammack, R.; Frey, M.; Robson, R.|title=Hydrogen as a Fuel: Learning from Nature|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|place=London|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been estimated that 99% of all organisms utilize [[dihydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Most of these species are microbes and their ability to use H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a metabolite arises from the expression of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[metalloenzyme]]s known as hydrogenases.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogenases are sub-classified into three different types based on the active site metal content: iron-iron hydrogenase, nickel-iron hydrogenase, and iron hydrogenase. 
[[File:ActiveSitesCorrected.png|thumb|center|x140px|The active site structures of the three types of hydrogenase enzymes.]]

==History==
In 1933, [[Marjory Stephenson]] and her student Stickland reported that cell suspensions catalysed the reduction of [[methylene blue]] with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Six years later, [[Hans Gaffron]] observed that the green photosynthetic alga ''[[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii]]'', would sometimes  produce hydrogen.  Gaffron and many other scientists failed to elucidate how it induced hydrogen production. In the late 1990s [[Anastasios Melis]] discovered that deprivation of sulfur induces the alga to switch from the production of oxygen (normal photosynthesis) to the production of hydrogen. He found that the [[enzyme]] responsible for this reaction is [[hydrogenase]], but that the hydrogenase lost this function in the presence of oxygen. Melis also discovered that depleting the amount of sulfur available to the algae interrupted their internal oxygen flow, allowing the hydrogenase an environment in which it can react, causing the algae to produce hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/10.04/mustread.html?pg=5 Reengineering Algae To Fuel The Hydrogen Economy]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Chlamydomonas moewusii'' is also a promising strain for the production of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| url = http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/content/full/127/3/740 |vauthors=Melis A, Happe T|lastauthoramp=yes |year = 2001 | title = Hydrogen Production.

==Industrial hydrogen==
Competing for biohydrogen, at least for commercial applications, are many mature industrial processes.  Hydrogen is usually derived from [[fossil fuels]] by [[steam reforming]] of [[natural gas]] - sometimes referred to as steam methane reforming (SMR) - is the most common method of producing bulk hydrogen at about 95% of the world production.&lt;ref&gt;P. Häussinger, R. Lohmüller, A. M. Watson, "Hydrogen, 2.

'''Celtic mazes''' are [[Line (mathematics)|straight-line]] [[spiral]] [[pattern|patterns]] that have been drawn all over the world since [[prehistory|prehistoric times]]. The patterns originate in early [[Celts|Celtic]] developments in stone and metal-work, and later in medieval [[Insular art]]. Prehistoric spiral designs date back to [[Gavrinis]] (c. 3500 BCE).&lt;ref name="Meehan"&gt;Meehan, Aidan (1993). ''Celtic Design: Maze Patterns'', pp. 7–8. {{ISBN|0-500-27747-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The straight-line spirals of Celtic labyrinths originated in [[chevron (insignia)|chevrons]] and [[lozenges]] and are drawn by the Celts using a [[connect the dots]] method.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

Celtic labyrinths are found among carvings at [[Camonica Valley]], occupied by the Celts early in the first millennium, most older than the one [[Knossos]] or Classical style example found there. The mythology associated with the labyrinths also suggest Celtic origin. For example, the labyrinths containing eyes or a figure with horns and a snake about its waist imply the deity [[Cernunnos]]. Lastly, Celtic examples resembling the Cretan model but featuring path-line reversal (the path of one is traceable as the line of the other) suggest Celtic pre-knowledge of their construction. Methods of constructing  Classical labyrinths from figure with serpent through waist and ocular spiral may be demonstrated.&lt;ref name="Meehan"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28630">'''Computational electromagnetics''', '''computational electrodynamics''' or '''electromagnetic modeling''' is the process of modeling the interaction of [[electromagnetic field]]s with physical objects and the environment.

It typically involves using computationally efficient approximations to [[Maxwell's equations]] and is used to calculate [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]] performance, [[electromagnetic compatibility]], [[radar cross section]] and electromagnetic [[wave propagation]] when not in free space.

A specific part of computational electromagnetics deals with [[electromagnetic radiation]] [[light scattering by particles|scattered and absorbed by small particles]].

==Background==
&lt;!-- ''Why do electromagnetic modeling?   is being modeled?  What are the computational issues?''  {{Expand section|date=October 2008}} --&gt;
Several real-world electromagnetic problems like [[Scattering#Electromagnetic scattering|electromagnetic scattering]], [[electromagnetic radiation]], modeling of [[waveguide]]s etc., are
not analytically calculable, for the multitude of irregular geometries found in actual devices. Computational numerical techniques can overcome the inability to derive closed form solutions of Maxwell's equations under various [[constitutive relation]]s of media, and [[boundary condition]]s. This makes ''computational electromagnetics'' (CEM) important to the design, and modeling of antenna, radar, [[communication satellite|satellite]] and other communication systems, [[nanophotonic]] devices and high speed [[silicon]] electronics, [[medical imaging]], cell-phone antenna design, among other applications.

CEM typically solves the problem of computing the ''E'' (electric) and ''H'' (magnetic) fields across the problem domain (e.g., to calculate antenna [[radiation pattern]] for an arbitrarily shaped antenna structure). Also calculating power flow direction ([[Poynting vector]]), a waveguide's [[normal mode]]s, media-generated wave dispersion, and scattering can be computed from the ''E'' and ''H'' fields. CEM models may or may not assume [[symmetry]], simplifying real world structures to idealized [[cylinder (geometry)|cylinder]]s, [[sphere]]s, and other regular geometrical objects. CEM models extensively make use of symmetry, and solve for reduced dimensionality from 3 spatial dimensions to 2D and even 1D.

An [[Eigenvalue, eigenvector and eigenspace|eigenvalue]] problem formulation of CEM allows us to calculate steady state normal modes in a structure. [[Transient response]] and impulse field effects are more accurately modeled by CEM in time domain, by [[FDTD]]. Curved geometrical objects are treated more accurately as finite elements [[Finite element method|FEM]], or non-orthogonal grids. [[Beam propagation method]] (BPM) can solve for the power flow in waveguides. CEM is application specific, even if different techniques converge to the same field and power distributions in the modeled domain.

==Overview of methods==
One approach is to discretize the space in terms of grids (both orthogonal, and non-orthogonal) and solving Maxwell's equations at each point in the grid. Discretization consumes computer memory, and solving the equations takes significant time. Large-scale CEM problems face memory and CPU limitations. As of 2007, CEM problems require supercomputers,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} high performance clusters,{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} vector processors and/or [[parallel computer|parallelism]]. Typical formulations involve either time-stepping through the equations over the whole domain for each time instant; or through banded [[matrix inversion]] to calculate the weights of basis functions, when modeled by finite element methods; or matrix products when using transfer matrix methods; or calculating [[integral]]s when using [[Boundary element method|method of moments]] (MoM); or using [[fast fourier transform]]s, and time iterations when calculating by the split-step method or by BPM.

==Choice of methods==
Choosing the right technique for solving a problem is important, as choosing the wrong one can either result in incorrect results, or results which take excessively long to compute. However, the name of a technique does not always tell one how it is implemented, especially for commercial tools, which will often have more than one solver.

Davidson&lt;ref name="davidson" /&gt; gives two tables comparing the FEM, MoM and FDTD techniques in the way they are normally implemented. One table is for both open region (radiation and scattering problems) and another table is for guided wave problems.

==Maxwell's equations in hyperbolic PDE form==
Maxwell's equations can be formulated as a [[hyperbolic system]] of [[partial differential equation]]s.  This gives access to powerful techniques for numerical solutions.

It is assumed that the waves propagate in the (''x'',''y'')-plane and restrict the direction of the magnetic field to be parallel to the ''z''-axis and thus the electric field to be parallel to the (''x'',''y'') plane. The wave is called a transverse magnetic (TM) wave.  In 2D and no polarization terms present, Maxwell's equations can then be formulated as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\bar{u} + A\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\bar{u} + B\frac{\partial}{\partial y}\bar{u} +C\bar{u} = \bar{g}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''u'', ''A'', ''B'', and ''C'' are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\bar{u}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_x \\ E_y \\ H_z \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; \frac{1}{\mu} &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;B=\left(\begin{matrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; \frac{-1}{\epsilon} \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ \frac{-1}{\mu} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;C=\left(\begin{matrix} \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; \frac{\sigma}{\epsilon} &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

In this representation, &lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[forcing function (differential equations)|forcing function]], and is in the same space as &lt;math&gt;\bar{u}&lt;/math&gt;.  It can be used to express an externally applied field or to describe an optimization [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]].  As formulated above:
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}=\left(\begin{matrix} E_{x, constraint} \\ E_{y, constraint} \\ H_{z, constraint} \end{matrix}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\bar{g}&lt;/math&gt; may also be explicitly defined equal to zero to simplify certain problems, or to find a [[Generalized eigenvector|characteristic solution]], which is often the first step in a method to find the particular inhomogeneous solution.

==Integral equation solvers==

===The discrete dipole approximation===
The [[discrete dipole approximation]] is a flexible technique for computing scattering and absorption by targets of arbitrary [[geometry]]. The formulation is based on integral form of Maxwell equations. The DDA is an approximation of the continuum target by a finite array of polarizable points. The points acquire [[Magnetic moment|dipole moment]]s in response to the local electric field. The dipoles of course interact with one another via their electric fields, so the DDA is also sometimes referred to as the coupled [[dipole]] approximation. The resulting linear system of equations is commonly solved using [[conjugate gradient]] iterations. The discretization matrix has symmetries (the integral form of Maxwell equations has form of convolution) enabling [[Fast Fourier Transform]] to multiply matrix times vector during conjugate gradient iterations.

===Method of moments element method ===
The method of moments (MoM)&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Harrington (1968). Field Computation by Moment Methods. Latest printing by IEEE Press in 1993, {{ISBN|0780310144}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[boundary element method]] (BEM) is a numerical computational method of solving linear partial differential equations which have been formulated as [[integral equation]]s (i.e. in ''boundary integral'' form). It can be applied in many areas of engineering and science including [[fluid mechanics]], [[acoustics]], [[electromagnetics]], [[fracture mechanics]], and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]].

MoM has become more popular since the 1980s. Because it requires calculating only boundary values, rather than values throughout the space, it is significantly more efficient in terms of computational resources for problems with a small surface/volume ratio. Conceptually, it works by constructing a "mesh" over the modeled surface.  However, for many problems, BEM are significantly computationally less efficient than volume-discretization methods ([[finite element method]], [[finite difference method]], [[finite volume method]]).  Boundary element formulations typically give rise to fully populated matrices. This means that the storage requirements and computational time will tend to grow according to the square of the problem size.  By contrast, finite element matrices are typically banded (elements are only locally connected) and the storage requirements for the system matrices typically grow linearly with the problem size.  Compression techniques (''e.g.'' multipole expansions or adaptive cross approximation/hierarchical matrices) can be used to ameliorate these problems, though at the cost of added complexity and with a success-rate that depends heavily on the nature and geometry of the problem.

BEM is applicable to problems for which [[Green's function]]s can be calculated.  These usually involve fields in [[linear]] [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] media.  This places considerable restrictions on the range and generality of problems suitable for boundary elements.  Nonlinearities can be included in the formulation, although they generally introduce volume integrals which require the volume to be discretized before solution, removing an oft-cited advantage of BEM.

===Fast multipole method ===
The [[fast multipole method]] (FMM) is an alternative to MoM or Ewald summation. It is an accurate simulation technique and requires less memory and processor power than MoM. The FMM was first introduced by [[Leslie Greengard|Greengard]] and [[Vladimir Rokhlin (American scientist)|Rokhlin]]&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Greengard and Vladimir Rokhlin (1987). "A Fast Algorithm for Particle Simulations." J. Computational Physics Vol. 73, No. 2, pp 325-348.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Rokhlin (1985). "Rapid Solution of Integral Equations of Classic Potential Theory." J. Computational Physics Vol. 60, pp. 187-207.&lt;/ref&gt; and is based on the [[multipole expansion]] technique. The first application of the FMM in computational electromagnetics was by Engheta et al.(1992).&lt;ref&gt;Nader Engheta, William D. Murphy, Vladimir Rokhlin, and Marius Vassiliou (1992), "The Fast Multipole Method for Electromagnetic Scattering Computation," IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation 40, 634-641.&lt;/ref&gt;  FMM can also be used to accelerate MoM.

===Plane wave time-domain ===
While the fast multipole method is useful for accelerating MoM solutions of integral equations with static or frequency-domain oscillatory kernels, the '''plane wave time-domain (PWTD)''' algorithm employs similar ideas to accelerate the MoM solution of time-domain integral equations involving the [[retarded potential]]. The PWTD algorithm was introduced in 1998 by Ergin, Shanker, and Michielssen.&lt;ref&gt;Ergin, A. A., Shanker, B., &amp; Michielssen, E. (1998). Fast evaluation of three-dimensional transient wave fields using diagonal translation operators. Journal of Computational Physics, 146(1), 157-180.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial element equivalent circuit method===
The [[partial element equivalent circuit]] (PEEC) is a 3D full-wave modeling method suitable for combined [[Electromagnetism|electromagnetic]] and [[Electronic circuit|circuit]] analysis. Unlike MoM, PEEC is a full [[spectrum]] method valid from [[Direct current|dc]] to the maximum [[frequency]] determined by the meshing. In the PEEC method, the [[integral equation]] is interpreted as [[Kirchhoff's voltage law]] applied to a basic PEEC cell which results in a complete circuit solution for 3D geometries. The equivalent circuit formulation allows for additional [[SPICE]] type circuit elements to be easily included. Further, the models and the analysis apply to both the time and the frequency domains. The circuit equations resulting from the PEEC model are easily constructed using a modified [[loop analysis]] (MLA) or [[modified nodal analysis]] (MNA) formulation. Besides providing a direct current solution, it has several other advantages over a MoM analysis for this class of problems since any type of circuit element can be included in a straightforward way with appropriate matrix stamps. The PEEC method has recently been extended to include nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1200853 A. E. Ruehli, G. Antonini, J. Esch, J. Ekman, A. Mayo, A. Orlandi, "Nonorthogonal PEEC formulation for time- and frequency-domain EM and circuit modeling," IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility, vol. 45, no. 2, pp. 167–176, May 2003.]&lt;/ref&gt; This model extension, which is consistent with the classical [[orthogonal]] formulation, includes the Manhattan representation of the geometries in addition to the more general [[quadrilateral]] and [[hexahedral]] elements. This helps in keeping the number of unknowns at a minimum and thus reduces computational time for nonorthogonal geometries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sm.luth.se/~jekman/PEEC/Program/ Partial Element Equivalent Circuit (PEEC) homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Differential equation solvers==

===Finite-difference time-domain ===
[[Finite-difference time-domain]] (FDTD) is a popular CEM technique. It is easy to understand. It has an exceptionally simple implementation for a full wave solver. It is at least an order of magnitude less work to implement a basic FDTD solver than either an FEM or MoM solver. FDTD is the only technique where one person can realistically implement oneself in a reasonable time frame, but even then, this will be for a quite specific problem.&lt;ref name="davidson"&gt;David B. Davidson, ''Computational Electromagnetics for RF and Microwave Engineering'', Second Edition, Cambridge University Press, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Since it is a time-domain method, solutions can cover a wide frequency range with a single simulation run, provided the time step is small enough to satisfy the [[Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem]] for the desired highest frequency.

FDTD belongs in the general class of grid-based differential time-domain numerical modeling methods. [[Maxwell's equations]] (in [[Partial differential equation|partial differential]] form) are modified to central-difference equations, discretized, and implemented in software. The equations are solved in a cyclic manner:  the [[electric field]] is solved at a given instant in time, then the [[magnetic field]] is solved at the next instant in time, and the process is repeated over and over again.

The basic FDTD algorithm traces back to a seminal 1966 paper by Kane Yee in [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]]. [[Allen Taflove]] originated the descriptor "Finite-difference time-domain" and its corresponding "FDTD" acronym in a 1980 paper in IEEE Transactions on Electromagnetic Compatibility. Since about 1990, FDTD techniques have emerged as the primary means to model many scientific and engineering problems addressing electromagnetic wave interactions with material structures. An effective technique based on a time-domain finite-volume discretization procedure was introduced by Mohammadian et al. in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Alireza H. Mohammadian, Vijaya Shankar, and William F. Hall (1991). "Computation of Electromagnetic Scattering and Radiation Using a Time-Domain Finite-Volume Discretization Procedure. Computer Physics Communications Vol. 68, No. 1, 175-196.&lt;/ref&gt;  Current FDTD modeling applications range from near-DC (ultralow-frequency geophysics involving the entire Earth-[[ionosphere]] waveguide) through [[microwave]]s (radar signature technology, antennas, wireless communications devices, digital interconnects, biomedical imaging/treatment) to visible light ([[photonic crystal]]s, nanoplasmonics, [[soliton]]s, and [[biophotonics]]).  Approximately 30 commercial and university-developed software suites are available.

===Multiresolution time-domain===
MRTD is an adaptive alternative to the finite difference time domain method (FDTD) based on [[wavelet]] analysis.

===Finite element method ===
The [[finite element method]] (FEM) is used to find approximate solution of [[partial differential equation]]s (PDE) and [[integral equation]]s.  The solution approach is based either on eliminating the time derivatives completely (steady state problems), or rendering the PDE into an equivalent [[ordinary differential equation]], which is then solved using standard techniques such as [[finite difference]]s, etc.

In solving [[partial differential equation]]s, the primary challenge is to create an equation which approximates the equation to be studied, but which is [[numerically stable]], meaning that errors in the input data and intermediate calculations do not accumulate and destroy the meaning of the resulting output. There are many ways of doing this, with various advantages and disadvantages. The finite element method is a good choice for solving partial differential equations over complex domains or when the desired precision varies over the entire domain.

===Finite integration technique ===
The finite integration technique (FIT) is a spatial discretization scheme to numerically solve electromagnetic field problems in time and frequency domain. It preserves basic [[topological]] properties of the continuous equations such as conservation of charge and energy. FIT was proposed in 1977 by [[w:de:Thomas Weiland|Thomas Weiland]] and has been enhanced continually over the years.&lt;ref&gt;
T. Weiland, A Discretization Method for the Solution of Maxwell's Equations for Six-Component Fields, Electronics and Communications AEUE, vol. 31, no. 3, pp. 116–120, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; This method covers the full range of electromagnetics (from static up to high frequency) and optic applications and is the basis for commercial simulation tools.&lt;ref&gt;
CST Studio Suite developed by [[Computer Simulation Technology]] (CST AG).&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}&lt;ref&gt;
Electromagnetic Simulation solutions developed by [[Nimbic]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=April 2013}}

The basic idea of this approach is to apply the Maxwell equations in integral form to a set of staggered grids. This method stands out due to high flexibility in geometric modeling and boundary handling as well as incorporation of arbitrary material distributions and material properties such as [[anisotropy]], non-linearity and dispersion. Furthermore, the use of a consistent dual orthogonal grid (e.g. [[Cartesian grid]]) in conjunction with an explicit time integration scheme (e.g. leap-frog-scheme) leads to compute and memory-efficient algorithms, which are especially adapted for transient field analysis in [[radio frequency]] (RF) applications.

===Pseudo-spectral time domain ===
This class of marching-in-time computational techniques for Maxwell's equations uses either discrete Fourier or [[discrete Chebyshev transform]]s to calculate the spatial derivatives of the electric and magnetic field vector components that are arranged in either a 2-D grid or 3-D lattice of unit cells. PSTD causes negligible numerical phase velocity anisotropy errors relative to FDTD, and therefore allows problems of much greater electrical size to be modeled.&lt;ref&gt;
For a recent comprehensive summary of PSTD techniques for Maxwell's equations, see Q. Liu and G. Zhao "Advances in PSTD Techniques," Chapter 17 in Computational Electrodynamics: The Finite-Difference Time-Domain Method, A. Taflove and S. C. Hagness, eds., Boston: [[Artech House]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pseudo-spectral spatial domain ===
PSSD solves Maxwell's equations by propagating them forward in a chosen spatial direction. The fields are therefore held as a function of time, and (possibly) any transverse spatial dimensions. The method is pseudo-spectral because temporal derivatives are calculated in the frequency domain with the aid of FFTs. Because the fields are held as functions of time, this enables arbitrary dispersion in the propagation medium to be rapidly and accurately modelled with minimal effort.&lt;ref&gt;
J.C.A. Tyrrell et al., [[Journal of Modern Optics]] 52, 973 (2005); {{doi|10.1080/09500340512331334086}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the choice to propagate forward in space (rather than in time) brings with it some subtleties, particularly if reflections are important.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kinsler, [[Phys. Rev. A]]81, 013819 (2010); {{doi|10.1103/PhysRevA.81.013819}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transmission line matrix ===
[[Transmission line matrix method|Transmission line matrix]] (TLM) can be formulated in several means as a direct set of lumped elements solvable directly by a circuit solver (ala SPICE, [[HSPICE]], et al.), as a custom network of elements or via a [[scattering matrix]] approach.  TLM is a very flexible analysis strategy akin to FDTD in capabilities, though more codes tend to be available with FDTD engines.

===Locally one-dimensional  ===

This is an implicit method. In this method, in two-dimensional case, Maxwell equations  are computed in two steps, whereas in three-dimensional case Maxwell equations are divided into three spatial coordinate directions. Stability and dispersion analysis of the three-dimensional LOD-FDTD method have been discussed in detail.&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li, Z.Chen., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 56, 3596-3600 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I.Ahmed, E.K.Chua, E.P.Li., [[IEEE Transactions on Antennas and Propagation]] 58, 3983-3989 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other methods==

===EigenMode expansion ===
[[Eigenmode expansion]] (EME) is a rigorous bi-directional technique to simulate electromagnetic propagation which relies on the decomposition of the electromagnetic fields into a basis set of local eigenmodes. The eigenmodes are found by solving Maxwell's equations in each local cross-section. Eigenmode expansion can solve Maxwell's equations in 2D and 3D and can provide a fully vectorial solution provided that the mode solvers are vectorial. It offers very strong benefits compared with the FDTD method for the modelling of optical waveguides, and it is a popular tool for the modelling of [[fiber optics]] and [[silicon photonics]] devices.

===Physical optics ===
[[Physical optics]] (PO) is the name of a [[high frequency approximation]] (short-[[wavelength]] [[approximation]]) commonly used in optics, [[electrical engineering]] and [[applied physics]].  It is an intermediate method between geometric optics, which ignores [[wave]] effects, and full wave [[electromagnetism]], which is a precise [[theory]]. The word "physical" means that it is more physical than [[geometrical optics]] and not that it is an exact physical theory.

The approximation consists of using ray optics to estimate the field on a surface and then [[integral|integrating]] that field over the surface to calculate the transmitted or scattered field. This resembles the [[Born approximation]], in that the details of the problem are treated as a [[perturbation theory|perturbation]].

===Uniform theory of diffraction ===
The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] (UTD) is a [[high frequency]] method for solving [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic]] [[scattering]] problems from electrically small discontinuities or discontinuities in more than one dimension at the same point.

The [[uniform theory of diffraction]] approximates [[near and far field|near field]] electromagnetic fields as quasi optical and uses ray diffraction to determine diffraction coefficients for each diffracting object-source combination. These coefficients are then used to calculate the field strength and [[phase (waves)|phase]] for each direction away from the diffracting point. These fields are then added to the incident fields and reflected fields to obtain a total solution.

==Validation==
Validation is one of the key issues facing electromagnetic simulation users. The user must understand and master the validity domain of its simulation. The measure is, "how far from the reality are the results?"

Answering  this question involves three steps: comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation, cross-comparison between codes, and comparison of simulation results with measurement.

===Comparison between simulation results and analytical formulation===
For example, assessing the value of the [[radar cross section]] of a plate with the analytical formula:

:: &lt;math&gt;\text{RCS}_\text{Plate} = \frac{4 \pi A^2}{\lambda^2},&lt;/math&gt;

: where '''A''' is the surface of the plate and &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength. The next curve presenting the RCS of a plate computed at 35 [[GHz]] can be used as reference example.

===Cross-comparison between codes===
One example is the cross comparison of results from method of moments and asymptotic methods in their validity domains.&lt;ref&gt;
As an illustration, the company [http://www.oktal-se.fr/ OKTAL-SE] made common development and cross comparison with the French research institute [http://www.onera.fr/ ONERA], comparing Method of Moment and Asymptotic methods. The cross comparison helped the validation process of the SE-RAY-EM code of OKTAL-SE. [http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/external/rcs_plate_35ghz.jpg Illustration]{{dead link|date=February 2017}} of the comparison between the SE-RAY-EM code and the ONERA reference code (right image).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison of simulation results with measurement===
The final validation step is made by comparison between measurements and simulation. For example, the RCS calculation&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.oktal-se.fr/ SE-RAY-EM]&lt;/ref&gt; and the measurement&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.fgan.de/ FGAN-FHR]&lt;/ref&gt; of a complex metallic object at 35&amp;nbsp;GHz. The computation implements GO, PO and PTD for the edges.

Validation processes can clearly reveal that  some differences can be explained by the differences between the experimental setup and its reproduction in the simulation environment.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071013230028/http://www.oktal-se.fr/website/news/pdf/RCS_35GHz_March2007.pdf full article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Light scattering codes==
There are now many efficient codes for solving electromagnetic scattering problems. They are listed as [[discrete dipole approximation codes]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by cylinders]], [[codes for electromagnetic scattering by spheres]]. Solutions which are analytical, such as Mie solution for scattering by spheres or cylinders, can be used to validate more involved techniques.

A '''concept-driven strategy''' is a process for formulating [[strategy]] that draws on the explanation of how humans inquire provided by linguistic pragmatic philosophy. This argues that thinking starts by selecting (explicitly or implicitly) a set of [[concept]]s (frames, patterns, lens, principles, etc.) gained from our past experiences. These are used to reflect on whatever happens, or is done, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;James, W. 1911/1996. Some Problems of Philosophy. University of Nebraska Press Nebraska.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concept-driven strategy therefore starts from agreeing and enacting a set of strategic concepts ([[organizing principle]]s) that "works best" for an organisation. For example, a hospital might set its strategy as intending to be Caring, World Class, Local, Evidence Based, and Team Based. A University might set its strategy as intending to be Ranked, Problem Solving, Online, Equis, and Offering Pathways. A commercial corporation might set its strategy as intending to be Innovative, Global, Have Visible Supply Chains, Agile and Market Share Dominant. These strategic concepts make up its ''Statement of Intent'' (or Purpose).

==Background==

Much of the [[strategic management]] literature mutates [[Peter Drucker]]'s call for corporations to start the strategic management process by producing a statement of purpose, mission and objectives. This has been mutated into a call to start with a vision, mission and objectives statement. There is an alternative approach which focuses on the Statement of Purpose or Intent. Drucker's example for this statement for a commercial corporation was to state that the corporation's purpose was to create customers. That is, it was going to use the concept of 'customer creation' to coordinate and organise the cognition or mindset of those that worked for the organisation. This was why the corporation existed. Having one concept is now thought to be insufficient. [[George Armitage Miller]]'s modified [[The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two]] and [[dialectic]] suggests a handful of concepts under tension would be preferable.

The Statement of Purpose, Statement of Intent or concept-driven approach to strategy formulation therefore focuses on setting and enacting a set strategic concepts. If a participatory approach is being used these concepts will be acquired through a process of collaboration with stakeholders. Once agreed the strategic concepts can be used to coordinate activities and act as a set of [[decision making]] criteria. The set of concepts that make up the Statement of Intent is then used to make sense of an unpredictable future across an organisation in a co-ordinated manner.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M. A Pragmatic System of Decision Criteria Systems Research and Behavioral Science 2012 {{DOI|10.1002/sres.2122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.ijproman.2012.12.006 | volume=31 | title=The linguistic turn in project conceptualization | year=2013 | journal=International Journal of Project Management | pages=1154–1162 | author=McKenna Allen, Metcalfe Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Underlying philosophy==

Linguistic [[pragmatism]] argues that our prior conceptions interpret our perception (sensory inputs). These conceptions are represented by concepts like running, smiling, justice, reasoning and agility. They are patterns of activity, experienced in our past and remembered. They can be named by those with language and so shared.&lt;ref&gt;Rorty, R. 1982. Consequences of Pragmatism. University of Minnesota Press, Minneapolis.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shields, P. 2005. Classical Pragmatism does not need an Upgrade. Administration &amp; Society 37(4) 504-518&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brandom, R., B,. 2011. Perspectives On Pragmatism. Havard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Haack, S. 2006. Pragmatism: Old and New. Prometheus Books, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toulmin, S. 1972. Human Understanding: The Collective Use and Evolution of Concepts. Princeton University Press, Princeton New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagginni explains pragmatic concepts using the classic example of whether the earth is flat or round.&lt;ref&gt;Baggini, J. 2005. Pragmatism History Of Ideas. BBC Radio 4, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"...if we treat the world as if these concepts do exist then we find we can manipulate the world and make things work much better. The point about this is that you cannot just choose any concept. What is useful is not just on our whim to choose. [A concept is] a better concept for looking at the world because it works much better than others. You don't have to worry, as some British philosophers have thought that if you go down the pragmatic route that you might believe the world is flat because [that fits best with our sensory input]. Ultimately it isn't useful to believe that the world is flat. All sorts of things won't work if you construct your view in that way. These concepts are tools for helping us manipulate the world and some work better than others."|Julian Baggini, (aired 2005) Editor of The Philosophers' Magazine.}}

Another example would be that we can think of the war in Iraqi differently by reflecting off the concepts of oil security, Imperialism, aggressive capitalism, liberation or democracy. 
The concept-driven approach to strategy formulation involves setting and using a set of linguistic pragmatic concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe M  Pragmatic inquiry Journal of the Operational Research Society (2008) 59&lt;/ref&gt;

== Method ==

The steps to formulating a participatory concept-driven strategy are:

# Select who the strategy is for exactly, and what exactly is their problem. 
# Reflect on significant events in the past that have impacted on the organisation (past [[experience]] matters)
# Identify all stakeholders including suppliers, competitors, staff, alliances, government, environmentalist, industry experts, etc. 
# Ask them what concerns they have for the future relevant to your organisation. Use their experiences and expertise from being involved in the industry.  
# Use [[idea networking]] to cluster these stakeholder concern statements into about five clusters
# Name these clusters as strategic concepts (priorities, [[organizing principle]]s). For example, one cluster of statements might be about innovation, another about becoming more international. 
# Reflect on the possible paradoxical consequences of enacting these strategic concepts
# Draft a one-page 'Statement of Intent' which says the organisation intends to become more like the five or so strategic concepts.
# Draft implementation action plans for each strategic concept. These should be both organisational change actions and investment projects, with goals and milestones. 
# Communicate the 'Statement of Intent' and 'Action Plans' to stakeholders as appropriate.
# Get senior staffs' comments, performance measures, selection criteria and decision criteria to reflect the 'Statement of Intent'.
# In the longer term, reflect on the strategic concepts in the Statement of Intent.&lt;ref&gt;Blog on Concept Driven Strategy http://mudmap.wordpress.com/tag/concept-driven-strategy/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other terminology==
Concept-driven strategy is the name given to a number of similar [[strategic thinking]] approaches.

Generally, the term 'concept-driven' is used to encourage a focus on the 'concepts' being used.&lt;ref&gt;Mareschal, D., P. Quinn, S. Lea. 2010. The Making of Human Concepts. Oxford University Press, Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, M.L.G., B.R. Gaines. 1989. Comparing Conceptual Structures: Consensus, Conflict, Correspondence and Contrast. Knowledge Acquisition 1 341-363.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Concept learning]] or Management Concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Management Concepts Wikibooks http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Management_Concepts_and_Applications/Management&lt;/ref&gt;

Some organisations produce a 'statement of intent' with little thought as to the concepts it contains.&lt;ref&gt;Hamel, G., C.K. Prahalad. 2005. Strategic Intent. Harvard Business Review 83(7/8) 148-161.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Saku M., Sillance J.A.A. | year = 2007 | title = Strategic Intent as a Rhetorical Device | url = | journal = Scandinavian Journal of Management | volume = 23 | issue = | pages = 406–423 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Katada, T. 1994. Strategic Intent to Corporate Purpose: The Remaking of Komatsu. Harvard Business Review 72(6) 83-.&lt;/ref&gt; However, if it is a short list of concepts, high level objectives, principles, priorities or frames, then concept-driven strategy offers a philosophical basis for these statements.

Some organisations produce a 'strategic principles'&lt;ref&gt;Strategic Principals http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement http://disruptit.wordpress.com/2007/12/01/difference-between-strategic-principle-and-mission-statement/ Strategic Principals&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;How to Turn a Great Strategic Principle into Great Results http://www.strategydriven.com/2011/06/27/how-to-turn-a-great-strategic-principle-into-great-results/&lt;/ref&gt; statement which again is similar to a statement of intent and the same applies about the concepts approach offering a philosophical basis. The term 'strategic priorities' or 'strategic values' are often used in the same way as strategic principles.

The literature about 'corporate purpose'&lt;ref&gt;Basu, S. 1999. Corporate Purpose: Why it Matters More than Strategy. Garland Publishing, Inc, New York &amp; London.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellsworth, R., R. 2002. Leading with Purpose. Stanford University Press, California.&lt;/ref&gt; is also similar to that of strategic intent. Sometimes, purpose refers to present actions and intent to future ones. If purpose is expressed as a set of concepts, then the concepts approach again provides some philosophical basis.

There is a connection between '[[systems thinking]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ackoff R | year = 1971 | title = Towards A System Of System Concepts | url = | journal = Management Science | volume = 17 | issue = 11| pages = 661–671 | doi=10.1287/mnsc.17.11.661}}&lt;/ref&gt; and concept-driven strategy. The Churchman/Ackoff stream of systems thinking was interested in a developing generic system of concepts for thinking about problems. Rather than a generic set of concepts, the concept-driven approach uses whatever concepts stakeholders think work best for the future of their organisation.

There is a military planning approach called 'concept-led'.&lt;ref&gt;The Role of OR and Analysis in Concept-led Long Range Planning http://www.dsto.defence.gov.au/publications/2535/DSTO-CR-0282.pdf{{Dead link|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the implementation of 'Concept-led and Participative' planning in the development of the Defence Logistics Transformation Plan http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/4367990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Headline Experiment a concept-led team effort http://adamdonovan.net/pdf/adam%20defence%20mag.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The military-like leadership seems to have moved the concepts from being drivers to be leaders. There seems to be very little difference otherwise.

In turbulent environments, concepts are thought 'more flexible than objectives' (goals, targets) as they provide why certain actions are preferable. The purpose and intent literature likes to distinguish itself from the objectives literature by saying purpose and intent provide the reasons for (why change), the driver for change. Objectives are where you end up. In complex dynamic situations, there may be many acceptable end points, many of which cannot be anticipated by planners. Arguably the only objective is to survive. How is explained in the statement of intent.

Perhaps strangely, there is a connection between 'metaphor', [[metaphoric criticism]], or [[conceptual metaphor]] and concept-driven strategy. Pragmatic concepts are not images but most concepts relate to metaphors. For example, to say an organisation is like a machine, with cogs, or like an adaptive organism, is to use the concepts of machine and organism to reflect on organisations. Much of what has been written about the usefulness of metaphors in planning applies to concepts.&lt;ref&gt;Schon, D.A. 1963. Displacement of Concepts. Tavistock Publications, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term 'strategic frames' is not common given the extensive literature on [[frame analysis]] but frames and pragmatic concepts seem to be very similar. [[Amos Tversky]] defines a frame as a conception of outcomes.

The system of strategic concepts listed in a statement of intent, purpose, principles, frames or conceptual metaphor are [[organizing principle]](s).&lt;ref&gt;Vnuk-Balan, E. 2010. Concept Driven Strategy, American Academy of Management Conference, Toronto.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, as Karl Weick explains [[sensemaking]] as the process of conceptualising problems, concept-driven strategy might be thought of as a pragmatic means of sensemaking a strategy.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

'''Cotton made in Africa''' is a project initiative launched and managed by the [[Aid by Trade Foundation]] (AbTF), headquartered in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nabu.de/themen/international/laender/westafrika/ Participation of the German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union [[NABU]]]&lt;/ref&gt; AbTF was founded in 2005 by Dr. Michael Otto, the Hamburg business entrepreneur and Chairman of [[Otto GmbH|Otto Group]]. Cotton marketed under the badge is produced according to strict criteria for environmental, economic and social sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Promising agribusiness |author=Christina Gradl |publisher=dandc.eu |date=March 2013 |url=http://www.dandc.eu/de/article/kleinbauern-und-unternehmen-koennen-von-klug-geplanten-wertschoepfungsketten-profitieren|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development work in Africa==
===Core principles===
'Helping people to help themselves' is a core CmiA principle. The smallholder farmers receive on-site training in improved cultivation methods which allow them to increase their crop yields, generate higher income and thus raise their standard of living through their own efforts. CmiA plans to finance training over the long term through financial contributions from participating cotton trading companies, as well as through levying CmiA licence fees. Strictly speaking, CmiA is not organic cotton but places a strong emphasis on reducing the use of pesticides. However, pesticides listed under the [[Stockholm Convention]] are banned, as non-degradable or partially degradable [[Persistent Organic Pollutant|organic toxins]], so-called POPs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/10 Project objectives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702041928/http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/10 |date=2010-07-02 }} (source: CimA)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/15 Ecology]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (source: CimA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Countries===
CmiA Project countries include the West African states of Benin and Burkina Faso as well as Zambia - and since April 2008, also Mozambique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greeninnovation.googlepages.com/Studie_Cotton_made_in_Africa.pdf In the German WWF’s feasibility study (February 2005, Executive Summary, p. 1) [[Mali]], [[Tanzania]] and [[Uganda]] are listed as Project countries instead of Zambia und Mozambique]&lt;/ref&gt; These four countries are amongst the poorest on the planet. The Project reaches around 130,000 smallholder farmers in these regions and their efforts produce some 85,000 tonnes of raw CmiA cotton from a cultivation area of some 160.000 [[hectar]]es.

===Training===
In on-site training the African smallholder farmers learn about efficient methods of cultivation and how best to conserve precious resources. These skills help them increase their crops’ yield and quality through their own efforts. This qualification approach is aimed at helping the smallholder farmers find their own way out of the poverty trap in the long term, through targeting a significant improvement in the farmers’ income. And the results of initial studies show that the Project is having a beneficial effect: in Zambia, for instance, the crop yields of some groups of farmers have more than doubled,&lt;ref&gt;Data supplied by [http://www.welthungerhilfe.de/baumwolle_afrika.html German Agro Action]&lt;/ref&gt; while in Benin the quality of the cotton has been substantially improved after only two planting seasons.

===Strategic alliance===
In its detailed implementation of the Project, the Foundation works closely with its partners and specialists on site in the Project areas. Besides the [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (BMZ), CmiA is also supported by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bmz.de/de/presse/nl/newsletter_2009_01/index.html#anker7590571 [[Federal Ministry of Economic Cooperation and Development|BMZ]] newsletter, January 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; while the DEG, GTZ as well as the cotton traders Dunavant, ICA Talon and Faso Coton also participate in the Project. Further [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] supporting CmiA in an advisory capacity are [[Accenture]], [[Avery Dennison]], [[German Agro Action]],  [[Naturschutzbund Deutschland|German Nature and Biodiversity Conservation Union]] (NABU), [[McCann Erickson]] and the [[World Wide Fund For Nature]]. With the signature of a partnership agreement in December 2008 between the DEG and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation for the support of the cotton sector in sub-saharan Africa, CmiA gained a further valuable partner and sponsor to help finance the roll-out of the Project to other West African countries.

=== Verification ===
In-field cotton production, transport, ginning and storage of the raw cotton are all evaluated within the framework of an independent verification process based on a filter and traffic-light system. The structure and content of the CmiA verification system was prepared by the Dutch [[University of Wageningen]] and subsequently further developed by the consultancy [[PriceWaterhouseCoopers]], in close co-operation with central Aid by Trade Foundation stakeholders. The core of the verification system contains a filter based on a series of exclusion criteria, as well as a group of sustainability indicators. The exclusion criteria include the most abusive forms of child labour, slavery, forced labour and infringement of freedom of association (union membership). The sustainability indicators include soil and water protection practices such as [[crop rotation]] and [[soil refertilisation]] as well as the responsible use of pesticides.

== Marketing ==
=== Concept ===
As a pragmatic, market-orientated approach, the economic feasibility of Cotton made in Africa is not dependent on charity but on activating market forces. This means that expenses such as premium payments to the farmers, which ultimately add to the cost of the raw product, do not arise. CmiA-produced raw cotton is traded at market prices; in this regard the AbTF does not act as a cotton trader but rather as Project developer and holds the marketing rights to CmiA. As distribution partners, the members of the Demand Alliance pay a licence fee which is then reinvested in the Project countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/11 Textile chain] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827051700/http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/11 |date=2010-08-27 }} (source: CimA)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demand Alliance ===
CmiA targets the mass market for cotton goods, and the Demand Alliance of international textile companies is a decisive factor in the Project initiative’s success. These companies take up CmiA cotton for the production of their own goods and through this demand create a pull effect which runs right along the textile chain to reach the smallholder farmers in Africa. Demand Alliance members include Anson's, Celio, Otto Group, Peek &amp; Cloppenburg, PUMA, QVC, Tchibo, Tom Tailor, s.Oliver and 1888 Mills, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;Members of the [http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/12 Demand Alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024041849/http://www.cotton-made-in-africa.com/Article/en/12 |date=2009-10-24 }} (source: CmiA)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality Seal ===
Cotton made in Africa is used in the fashion and home textiles segments and all articles using CmiA are distinguished by a red label. CmiA is an ingredient brand: this means that it is not a product brand, but rather a brand for African cotton which is used as a raw material in branded products. CmiA thus defines itself as a Quality Seal and appears besides an already existing brand. It is also applied by branded product suppliers as an ‘extra quality mark’ to distinguish and differentiate their respective product.

=== Consumer trends ===
A 2008 survey of German consumers, commissioned by Accenture and carried out by market research institute Forsa, confirms the validity of the business model and development approach of initiatives such as [[Fairtrade]] or CmiA and organic products. Results show that 85 percent of German consumers are willing to pay more for clothing that can be proven to have been produced under environmentally sustainable and ethical working conditions. According to the survey, the significance of the topic of sustainability in consumer behaviour is also growing: a quarter of consumers surveyed stated they were willing to pay over 20 percent more for clothing produced under sustainable conditions, although one in three respondees stated they planned to reduce their clothing expenditure. A clear consequence of these developments is that companies which ignore the trend towards sustainability are very likely to lose customers. 77 percent of Germans stated that they would buy less or even no products from their preferred supplier, if it could not prove that these had been produced under sustainable conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accenture.com/Countries/Germany/About_Accenture/Newsroom/News_Releases/AccentureUmfrageMode.htm Forsa survey for Accenture]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jury international01.jpg|thumb{{largethumb}}|The same group will offer a majority vote for, as well as against, a plan depending on how the group is polled.]]

'''Discursive dilemma''' or '''doctrinal paradox''' is a [[paradox]] in [[social choice theory]]. The paradox is that aggregating judgments with [[majority voting]] can result in self-contradictory judgments.

Consider a community voting on a road repairs. The same group may return a "Yes" if asked three questions, but a "No" if asked one question. This paradox emerges because the community may vote 'Yes' - the roads are important, and 'Yes' - the weather is right for road repair, and 'Yes' - there are available funds for the repairs. However, due to complexity of individual opinion and disagreement, the majority may at the same time rule that "No, all three requirements for road repair are not present". Thus the road repair team gets different feedback depending on how they poll their community.

Philosopher Philip Pettit believes the discursive dilemma makes it impossible to make simple statements about the beliefs of a collective.

==Overview==
Princeton philosopher Philip Pettit says there are hidden challenges of describing the group as though it were a single individual - a metaphorical agent - the way the law sometimes talks about corporations. It is a mistake, he says, to think things can be that simple.

In reality, it can be quite difficult to construct a model of the "group mind" by merely asking for a majority opinion. This is because contradictory conceptions of a group can emerge depending on the type of questioning that is chosen.&lt;ref name=Pettit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philosophybites.com/2010/12/philip-pettit-on-group-agency.html|title=Philip Pettit on Group Agency|publisher=philosophybites.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To see how, imagine that a three-member court must decide whether someone is liable for a breach of contract. For example, a lawn caretaker is accused of violating a contract not to mow over the land-owner's roses. The judges have to decide which of the following propositions are true:
* ''P'': the defendant did a certain action (i.e. did the caretaker mow over the roses?);
* ''Q'': the defendant had a contractual obligation not to do that action (i.e. was there a contract not to mow over the roses?);
* ''C'': the defendant is liable.
Additionally, all judges accept the proposition &lt;math&gt;C \equiv P \land Q&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, the judges agree that a defendant should be liable if and only if the two propositions, P and Q, are both true.

Each judge could make consistent (non-contradictory) judgments, and the paradox will still emerge. Most judges could think P is true, and most judges could think Q is true. In this example, that means they would vote that the caretaker probably mowed over the roses, and that the contract did indeed forbid that action. This suggests the caretaker is ''liable''. 

At the same time, most judges may think that P and Q are not both true at once. In this example, that means most judges conclude the caretaker is ''not liable''. The table above illustrates how majority decisions can contradict (because the judges vote in favor of the premises, and yet reject the conclusion). The paradox lies in choosing between two group liability opinions.

==Explanation==
This dilemma results because an actual decision-making procedure might be premise-based or conclusion-based. In a premise-based procedure, the judges decide by voting whether the conditions for liability are met. In a conclusion-based procedure, the judges decide directly whether the defendant should be liable. In the above formulation, the paradox is that the two procedures don't necessarily lead to the same result; the two procedures can even lead to opposite results.

Pettit believes that the lesson of this paradox is that there is no simple way to aggregate individual opinions into a single, coherent "group entity". These ideas are relevant to [[sociology]], which endeavors to understand and predict group behaviour. Petitt warns that we need to understand groups because they can be very powerful, can effect greater change, and yet the group as a whole may not have a strong conscience (see [[Diffusion of responsibility]]). He says we sometimes fail to hold groups (e.g. corporations) responsible because of the difficulties described above. [[Collective responsibility]] is important to sort out, and Petitt insists that groups should have limited rights, and various obligations and checks on their power.&lt;ref name=Pettit/&gt;

The discursive dilemma (which concerns general proposition sets) can be seen as a generalization of the [[Condorcet paradox]] (which concerns preference sets, a kind of proposition set). Furthermore, the Condorcet paradox can be generalized to [[Arrow's theorem]]. List and Pettit argue that the discursive dilemma can be likewise generalized to a sort of "List-Pettit theorem". Their theorem states that the inconsistencies remain for any aggregation method which meets a few natural conditions.

'''Anatolian animal carpets''' represent a special type of pile-woven [[Turkish carpet|carpet]], woven in the geographical region of Anatolia during the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq]] and early [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] period, corresponding to the 14th–16th century. Very few animal-style carpets still exist today, and most of them are in a fragmentary state. Animal carpets were frequently depicted by Western European painters of the 14th–16th century. By comparison of the few surviving carpets with their painted counterparts, these paintings helped to establish a timeline of their production, and support our knowledge about the early Turkish carpet.&lt;ref name="Erdmann, Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets, 1970"&gt;{{Cite book|author=Erdmann, Kurt|year=1970|title=Seven Hundred Years of Oriental Carpets|location=Berkeley, California|publisher=University of California Press (translated from the German ''Siebenhundert Jahre Orientteppich'' by May H. Beattie and Hildegard Herzog)|isbn=9780520018167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surviving carpets ==

=== Dragon and Phoenix carpet ===
A traditional Chinese motif, the fight between the [[fenghuang]], or Chinese [[phoenix (mythology)|phoenix]], and the dragon, is seen in an Anatolian carpet at the [[Pergamon Museum]], Berlin. [[Radiocarbon dating]] confirmed that the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet was woven in the mid 15th century, during the early [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rageth|first1=Jürg|title=Dating the dragon &amp; phoenix fragments.|journal=Hali|date=2004|volume=134|pages=106–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is knotted with symmetric knots.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beselin|first1=Anna|title=Geknüpfte Kunst : Teppiche des Museums für Islamische Kunst = Woven Art: Carpets of the Berlin Museum of Islamic art|date=2011|publisher=Edition Minerva|location=Wolfratshausen|isbn=9783938832806|pages=46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese motif was probably introduced into [[Islamic art]] by the Mongols, or artists working for them, during the thirteenth century.&lt;ref name="Dragon and Phoenix carpet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dragon and Phoenix Carpet|url=http://www.discoverislamicart.org/database_item.php?id=object;ISL;de;Mus01;34;de|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragon and Phoenix carpet lacks his original borders, and seems to be cut off at the right side. Its field is parted into two rectangular sections, each containing a yellow-groud octagon in which a Chinese dragon and a phoenix are opposed to each other in combat. Both animals are stylized in geometrical form. Their blue colours, outlined in red, contrasts well with the yellow ground of the octagon. The design of the upper octagon appears to be somewhat more compressed than the lower. The corners between the octagon and the rectangular field are filled in with red triangles and rows of white hooks on red ground, creating a reciprocal hook design. The rectangular fields are surrounded by a small guardian border showing a row of pearls in different colours. The main border has red floral tendrils composed of identical, S-like ornaments on a brown ground.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;

The Phoenix and Dragon carpet was first described in 1881 by [[Julius Lessing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lessing|first1=Julius|title=Orientalische Teppiche = Oriental Carpets|date=1891|publisher=Ernst Wasmuth|location=Berlin|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wilhelm von Bode]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=von Bode|first1=Wilhelm|title=Teppich-Erzeugung im Orient. Monographien von Sir George Birdwood in London, Geheimrath Dr. Wilhelm Bode in Berlin, C. Purdon Clarke in London, M. Gerspach in Paris, Sidney J. A. Churchill, M. R. A. S. in Teheran, Vincent J. Robinson in London, u.a.|date=1895|publisher=Verlag des K. K. Österreichischen Handels-Museums|location=Wien}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the Dragon and Phoenix carpet has been referred to in many books on Oriental carpets.

A similar fragment was discovered in [[Fustat]], with dragon and phoenix depicted in combat on a yellow field. The animals in this fragment are depicted in red, and outlined in blue. The minor border shows a variant of the "kufic" borders known from other Seljuq period carpets.

=== Marby rug ===
Another carpet showing two medallions with two birds besides a tree was found in the Swedish church of Marby in [[Jämtland]] province. The rug was radiocarbon dated to 1300–1420.&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt; More fragments of this type were found in Fostat, today a suburb of the city of Cairo.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lamm|first1=C.J.|title=Carpet fragments: The Marby rug and some fragments of carpets found in Egypt (Nationalmuseums skriftserie)|date=1985|publisher=Swedish National Museum|isbn=978-9171002914|edition=1937 reprint}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Marby rug is divided into two rectangles, each containing an octagon with a tree and a pair of birds. The tree is mirrored along the horizontal middle axis of the octagon in a way which suggests its image is reflected in water.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt;

Both the Phoenix and Dragon, and the Marby rug, have additional rows of knots on their backsides. At a distance of every 6&amp;nbsp;cm, rows of loosely tied knots of red thread are woven in. Another carpet fragment from [[Fustat]] has similar additional knots. It has been suggested that these rows of knots mark the weaver's progress during a given time. On average, the additional knots are repeated every 15 rows in the Dragon and Phoenix rug. At an estimated original width of 1 m, about 3800 knots were woven between two rows of the additional red knots, consistent with the dimensions of the carpet and the amount of knots a single weaver can tie in a carpet during a day.(Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;46–49&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;)

=== Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum ===
The "Dragon and Phoenix" and the "Marby" rugs were the only existing examples of Anatolian animal carpets known until 1988. Since then, seven more carpets of this type have been found. They survived in Tibetan monasteries and were removed by monks fleeing to Nepal during the [[Cultural Revolution|Chinese cultural revolution]]. One of these carpets was acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art&lt;ref name="MET animal carpet Acc.Nr. 1990.61"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal carpet at the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/453317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which parallels a painting by the [[Siena|Sienese]]  artist [[Gregorio di Cecco]]: "The Marriage of the Virgin", 1423.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Gallery London|url=http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/probably-by-gregorio-di-cecco-di-luca-the-marriage-of-the-virgin|website=National Gallery London NG 1317|accessdate=12 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shows large [[confronted animals]], each with a smaller animal inside.

=== Animal carpets from the Vakıflar Museum ===
The field of an animal carpet in the Vakıflar Museum, [[Istanbul]] (Inv. No. E-1)&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Balpınar|first1=Belkıs|last2=HIrsch|first2=Udo|title=Carpets of the Vakiflar Museum Istanbul = Teppiche des Vakiflar-Museums Istanbul|date=1988|publisher=U. Hülsey|location=Wesel|isbn=3923185049|pages=190–191}}&lt;/ref&gt; is divided into two rectangular compartments by a band similar to its borders. An octagon containing [[confronted animals]] is inscribed into each compartment. The winged animals face a stylized tree. They show a down-turned, snout-like head, to which antler-like extensions are attached, and their body is spotted. Overall, the animals more resemble [[fallow deer]] than birds, which are usually depicted on animal carpets. Deer and fallow deer are already depicted on the borders of the [[Pazyryk carpet]], and are frequently seen on early textiles and other objects in Anatolia and Iran. Below each deer, and above the main animal, is a bird-like quadruped.&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;

Another animal carpet with a coarser design compared to the Vakıflar rug is at the [[Mevlana Museum]] in [[Konya]] (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt;).

=== Animal carpet from the Pergamon Museum ===
Another carpet in the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a rectangular field surrounded by an eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each at the top and bottom of each star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and the outlines of the animals are woven in offset knotting. By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional [[Warp and woof|wefts]] can be seen meandering over two [[Warp and woof|warps]] after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;50–1&lt;ref name="Beselin, 2011"/&gt;) See: [[knot density]].

=== Batári-Crivelli fragment, Museum of Applied Arts, Budapest ===
The animal carpet fragment is approximately half the original size. Its field contains two large, 16-pointed star medallions of identical design which both include an eight-pointed star within an octagon. In every second segment of the medallions two birds appear, alternating with two four-legged animals. The field between the medallions is ornamented with smaller rosettes and eight-pointed stars. Each corner contains a [[mosque lamp]] ornament. In the center of the long side an octagonal smaller medallion is inserted. The Batári-Crivelli fragment resembles the "Dragon and Phoenix" and "Marby" rugs in having a yellow ground and two large medallions as the main element of design. [[Chromatography|Chromatographic]] analysis of the dyes revealed yellow from an undefined plant, [[indigo]] blue, [[Rubia tinctorum|madder (Rubia tinctorum)]] red, a blue green derived from indigo, Dyer's weed ([[Reseda luteola]]), and Dyer's sage ([[Salvia fruticosa]]), dark brown and undyed, ivory wool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Batári|first1=Ferenc|title=Ottoman Turkish carpets|date=1994|publisher=Budapest Museum of Applied Arts|location=Budapest|isbn=978-9630492126|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 13th International Congress of Turkish Art, held in Budapest on 3 September 2007, the fragment was renamed in honour of Ferenc Batári, the late curator of the carpet and textile department of the museum.

Other animal carpets are at the [[Museum of Islamic Art, Doha]] and in private collections.

== Animal carpets in Renaissance painting ==
{{see also|Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting}}
Animal-style carpets begin to appear in Italian paintings in the 14th, and continue to be depicted in Western European paintings throughout the 15th century. They represent the earliest Oriental carpets which were identified in [[Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting|Renaissance painting]]. The comparison of animal-style carpets on Renaissance paintings, for which the painter and the date of origin are often known, allows for the determination of a [[Terminus post quem|"''terminus ante quem''"]] date for existing carpets of similar design. Wilhelm von Bode identified a carpet on [[Domenico di Bartolo]]'s 1440 painting ''The Marriage of the Foundlings'' with marked similarities to the "Dragon and Phoenix" carpet. This marks the beginning of the "ante quem" method, which was subsequently further elaborated by the "Berlin School" of History of Islamic Art. By this method, a variety of existing carpets could be dated by comparison to their painted counterparts.

The illustrated rugs are generally drawn by the early Renaissance painters in a simplified manner, compared to the original carpet designs. The artists may sometimes have painted the animals out of their imagination, but the general appearance of the painted rugs still resembles the originals.&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;

A general compositional analysis of the animal-style rugs from Renaissance paintings was first developed by [[Kurt Erdmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Erdmann|first1=Kurt|title=Orientalische Tierteppiche auf Bildern des XIV. und XV Jahrhunderts = Oriental animal carpets on paintings of the 14th and 15th century.|journal=Jahrbuch der preussischen Kunstsammlungen|date=1929|issue=5|pages=261–298|jstor=23350357}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of animal carpets is usually divided into rectangular compartments, large or small. Each compartment contains an octagon, which in turn contains animal figures of four types:
# "Heraldic" animals, including single- or double-headed eagles;
# A pair of birds and a tree;
# Single birds or quadrupeds in a geometric frame;
# Paired animals within a frame, sometimes depicted in combat.

=== 14th century ===
At the beginning of the 14th century, carpets with stylized single- or double-headed eagles appear. These are frequently seen in paintings of the [[Italian Renaissance painting|Siena and Florence school]]. During the second half of the 14th century, stylized birds opposing a tree appear in [[Lippo Memmi]]'s ''Virgin Mary and Child'', 1340–50, and in [[Sano di Pietro]]'s ''Marriage of the Virgin'', 1448-52. Yetkin has identified a similar rug in the Vakıflar Halı Museum, Istanbul (Yetkin 1981, plate 17&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yetkin|first1=Serare|title=Historical Turkish Carpets|date=1981|publisher=Turkiye is Bankasi Cultural Publications|location=Istanbul|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The field of this rug is arranged in the common style, with birds facing a tree, but the birds are crested, and their design is more elaborate. The corners of the composition are filled with animal motifs, perhaps dragons. An animal-style rug with this more developed design appears on a painting by [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mills|first1=John|title=Early animal carpets in Western paintings|journal=Hali|date=1978|volume=1|issue=3|pages=234–43}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

A carpet fragment with a single bird with its head turned is now in the collection of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fragment of an animal carpet|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/collection/the-collection-online/search/448133?rpp=30&amp;pg=1&amp;ft=carpet+fragment&amp;pos=18|website=Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=6 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A painted counterpart can be seen in [[Niccolò di Buonaccorso]]'s "Marriage of the Virgin", 1380.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== 15th – 16th century ===
By the beginning of the 15th century, the variations of the animal design increase:

Two animal-style carpet fragments from Fustat were dated to the 15th century.&lt;ref name="Lamm, 1937"/&gt; They contain parts of a different version of the tree-and-birds pattern seen in the Marby rug. The field is no longer divided into fields, and the tree-and-paired birds pattern appear in offset rows, covering the field in endless repeat (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;29, plates 18,19&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

A fresco in the [[Palais des Papes]] at Avignon, by [[Matteo di Giovanni]] depicts a carpet with rather indistinct bird figures in front of the Pope's throne. Written sources of the 14th century indicate that [[Pope Benedict XII]] very much liked a carpet with "white swans", which he had set before his throne. A painting by [[Giovanni di Paolo]], 1440, shows an Anatolian animal style rug with birds spread before the pope's throne (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;33, ill. 5 and 6&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

Various examples are known of paintings with single birds in rows without the rectangular field partition. A rug in the [[Konya Archaeological Museum]], dated to the 15th century, represents an original from this group (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;31, plate 20&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). A painting by [[Jaume Huguet]] in the [[Museu Nacional d'Art de Catalunya]] contains a nearly identical rug. Similar rugs can be seen in a painting by Giovanni di Paolo in the [[Doria Pamphilj Gallery]], Rome, and in "Madonna enthroned" by [[Ambrogio Lorenzetti]] (Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;34, ill. 7 and 8&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;). Another animal-type carpet of different design appears in [[Carlo Crivelli]]'s "Annunciation", 1482. The design of this rug consists of stylized animal figures arranged between eight-pointed stars. A paired animal rug can be seen on [[Fra Angelico]]'s [[San Marco Altarpiece]].

The Pergamon Museum's "Phoenix and Dragon" finds its painted counterparts in Domenico di Bartolo's "The Marriage of the Foundlings" (1440) shows a very similar rug, as well as [[Alesso Baldovinetti]]'s "Tale of Saint Vincenzo Ferrerio", and [[Jacopo Bellini]]'s "Annunciation".

The Vakıflar Museum's animal carpet has a painted counterpart in [[William Larkin (painter)|William Larkin]]'s "Portrait of Dorothy Cary, later Viscountess Rochford". The animals shown in the painted rug are very similar to the small bird-like animals in the Vakıflar carpet. As known so far, the carpet depicted in Larkin's portrait is the last of its kind, and the last animal carpet seen in a Western European painting (Balpınar, 1988, p.&amp;nbsp;62,&lt;ref name="Balpinar, 1988"/&gt; Yetkin, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;36&lt;ref name="Yetkin, 1981"/&gt;).

The Batári-Crivelli fragment finds its parallel in two paintings by [[Carlo Crivelli]], the ''Annunciation'' of 1482 in the [[Städel]] museum in Frankfurt and the ''Annunciation, with Saint Emidius'' in the [[National Gallery]] (1486). Both paintings depict a carpet with a sixteen-pointed star motif, with some compartments containing highly stylised animal motifs.

The '''Economic and Social Research Institute''' is an independent research institute founded in 1960 to provide evidence-based research used to inform public policy debate and decision-making.  The research of the Institute focuses on the areas of sustainable economic growth and social progress. [[Alan Barrett (economist)|Alan Barrett]] is the Director of the Institute.

==History==
The Institute was founded in 1960 by a group of senior academics and public servants, led by Dr. T.K. Whitaker, Secretary of the Department of Finance. While conducting an economic study of Ireland, Whitaker became aware of the necessity for an independent research organisation to conduct analysis of data using up-to-date quantitative techniques in order to make the data useful for public policy makers. The U.S.-based Ford Foundation provided seed funding to establish the Economic Research Institute in 1960. In 1966 the remit of the Institute was expanded to include social research and the name changed to Economic and Social Research Institute. The first Director of the Institute was [[Roy C. Geary]], Irish statistician and founder of the Central Statistics Office.

==Mission of the Institute and Fields of Study==
The mission of the Institute is to produce economic and social research that informs public policymaking and civil society, in order to achieve its vision of “Informed policy for a better Ireland”. The institute makes significant contributions across its 12 designated areas of research:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esri.ie/pubs/STRATEGY2014.pdf|title=ESRI Research Strategy, 2014-2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; macroeconomics; internationalisation and competitiveness; energy and environment; communications and transport; labour markets and skills; migration, integration and demography; education; taxation, welfare and pensions; social inclusion and equality; health and quality of life; children and young people; and behavioural economics.

Since 2006, the Institute has conducted the research for [http://www.esri.ie/growing-up-in-ireland/ Growing Up in Ireland], a national longitudinal study of children and youth, funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  The most significant study of its kind ever to take place in Ireland, the purpose is to examine how children in Ireland are developing in the current social, economic and cultural environment. The second phase of this study began in 2015 and is conducted in conjunction with researchers from Trinity College Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.growingup.ie/index.php?id=10|title=Growing Up in Ireland website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Economic and Social Research Institute and Trinity College Dublin agreed to a strategic partnership in July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/news_events/articles/new-strategic-partnership-between-tcd-and-the-esri/3761#.VuVQ4_mLTIU|title="New Strategic Partnership between TCD and the ESRI", TCD Press Release,14 July 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement enables both institutions to build collaborative and complementary strengths in the social sciences.

The ESRI has been noted for its strength in quantitative research methods. It is listed by IDEAS/RePEc among the top 20 economic think tanks in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/top.ttanks.html|title="Top 25% Think Tanks", Repec website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Institute’s research is disseminated through ESRI publications, academic journals, books and government reports. The Institute has a number of regular publications, including the following:

·        The ''Quarterly Economic Commentary'' provides analysis of current economic trends and macroeconomic forecasts for the current and following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esri.ie/publications/quarterly-economic-commentary-winter-2015/|title=ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary, Winter 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·        The ''Medium Term Review'' provides a medium-term macroeconomic outlook for Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esri.ie/publications/medium-term-review-2013-2020/|title=ESRI Medium-Term Review, 2013-2020|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·        ''Research Bulletins'' provide shorter, accessible summaries of work already published by ESRI researchers.

·        The monthly ''Consumer Sentiment Index'', produced jointly with KBC Bank, provides figures on consumer spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esri.ie/category/irish-economy/consumer-sentiment-index/|title=Consumer Sentiment Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

·        The monthly ''Savings Index'', produced jointly with Nationwide provides statistics on personal savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esri.ie/category/savings-index/|title=ESRI/Nationwide (UK) Savings Index|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of the ESRI's own publications are available for download free-of-charge from the Institute’s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esri.ie/publications/|title=ESRI Publications|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance of the Institute==
The Economic and Social Research Institute is a company limited by guarantee, incorporated in 1960. It is a not for profit organisation registered as a charity. The Institute is answerable to more than 300 members, comprising both individuals and companies.

The Institute is governed by a Council of up to 14 members, including the Director. The Council members are drawn from a cross-section of the Institute’s members, from  academia, civil service, state agencies, business and civil society. Additionally, there is a Forum of more than 30 members representing a broad range of stakeholders, who are consulted in relation to the Institute’s strategic development.

The ESRI is audited by the Comptroller &amp; Auditor General and is subject to the rules that apply to state organisations in relation to prompt payments, disclosure, risk management and tax clearance. Since the 1st May 2013, the Institute has been subject to oversight by the Office of the Ombudsman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.esri.ie/about/governance/|title="Governance of the ESRI", ESRI website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The Institute receives an annual government grant-in-aid to support the public good elements of the Institute's activities. Other funding comes from:

• Major research programme agreements with government departments and state agencies;

• Specific research projects commissioned by government departments, state agencies and international bodies such as the European Commission;

• Membership subscriptions;

• Sale of publications;

• Sponsorship by Irish business.

'''Economics of the arts and literature'''  or '''cultural economics''' (used below for convenience) is a branch of economics that studies the economics of creation, distribution, and the consumption of [[work of art|works of art]], literature and similar creative and/or cultural products.   For a long time, the concept of the "arts" were confined to visual arts (e.g., painting) and performing arts (music, theatre, dance) in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Usage has widened since the beginning of the 1980s with the study of [[cultural industry]] (cinema, television programs, book and periodical publishing and music publishing) and the economy of cultural institutions (museums, libraries, historic buildings).  The field is coded as [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|JEL: Z11]] in the ''[[Journal of Economic Literature]]'' [[JEL classification codes|classification system]] used for article searches.&lt;ref&gt;In the JEL system, '[[Cultural economics|Cultural Economics]]' is a [[JEL classification codes#Other special topics (economics) JEL: Z Subcategories|broader category]] than used in this article.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
[[File:Alejandro Plaza.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Painter Alejandro Plaza at work on a canvas. Once this painting is complete, it will be a unique good, for which there is no exact substitute]]
Cultural economics is concerned with the arts in a broad sense. The goods considered have creative content, but that is not enough to qualify as a cultural good. Designer goods such as clothes and drapes are not considered usually to be works of art or culture. Cultural goods are those with a value determined by symbolic content rather than physical characteristics. (For further considerations, see also [[Cultural Institutions Studies]]). Economic thinking has been applied in ever more areas in the last decennia, including pollution, corruption and education.

Works of art and culture have a specific quality, which is their uniqueness. While other economic goods, such as [[crude oil]] or [[wheat]] are generic, interchangeable commodities (given a specific grade of the product), there is only one example of a famous painting such as the [[Mona Lisa]], and only one example of Rodin's well-known sculpture "[[The Thinker]]". While copies or reproductions can be made of these works of art, and while many inexpensive posters of the Mona Lisa and small factory-made replicas of "The Thinker" are sold, neither full-size copies nor inexpensive reproductions are viewed as substitutes for the real artworks, in the way that a consumer views a pound of Grade A sugar from Cuba as a fully equivalent substitute for a pound of Grade A sugar from United States or Dominican Republic.  As there is no equivalent item or substitute for these famous works of art, classical economist [[Adam Smith]] held it was impossible to value them. [[Alfred Marshall]] noted that the demand for a certain kind of cultural good can depend on its consumption: The more you have listened to a particular kind of music, the more you appreciate. In his economic framework, these goods do not have the usual decreasing [[marginal utility]].

Key academic works in cultural economics include those of [[William Baumol|Baumol]] and [[William G. Bowen|Bowen]] (Performing Arts, The Economic Dilemma, 1966), of [[Gary Becker]] on addictive goods, and of [[Alan Peacock]] (public choice). This summary has been divided into sections on the economic study of the performing arts, on the market of individual pieces of art, the art market in cultural industries, the economics of cultural heritage and the labour market in the art sector.

== Performing arts: Baumol and cultural economics ==
[[File:Lux Video Theatre rehearsal 1951.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This picture shows actors rehearsing for a play in 1951. Despite the numerous technological advances in between 1951 and the 2010s, in the 2010s, it would still require the same number of actors to perform this play. For this reason, scholars argue that some cultural industries are not getting more efficient the way other industries, such as accounting and banking, are; these latter two industries require far fewer workers in the 2010s due to the development of computer programs.]]
The seminal paper by William Baumol and Bowen introduced the term [[Baumol's cost disease|cost disease]] for a relative cost growth of live performances. This cost growth explains the increasing dependency of this kind of art on state subsidies. It occurs when the consumable good is labour itself. To understand this phenomenon, compare the change in the cost of performing the [[Molière]] play "[[Tartuffe]]" in 1664 and in 2007 with the change in cost of calculating a large number of sums from an accounting ledger. In 1664, you needed two hours and twelve actors to perform Molière's play, and it would take, say, twelve accountants working for two hours to add up all the sums in an accounting ledger. In 2007, a single accountant with a $10 calculator can add the sums in 20 minutes, but you still need two hours and twelve actors for the Molière play. Artists must make a considerable investment in [[human capital]] (e.g., training), and needs to be paid accordingly. The artists' pay needs to rise along with that of the population in general. As the latter is following the general productivity in the economy, the cost of a play will rise with general productivity, while the actors' productivity does not rise.

There are two lines of thought in subsequent literature on the economics of the performing arts:

*The first concentrates on the existence of productivity growth in some areas of production, thus contradicting the relevance of cost disease. Staying with the "Tartuffe" example, the same performance can be viewed by an ever-larger audience by improvements in the design of theatres, and by the introduction of microphones, television and recording.
*The second is concerned with the allocation of subsidies to the cultural sector. While these should be in the general public interest, they may have an income distribution effect, e.g. if they reduce cost to the relatively well-off part of society. This is the case when the well-off are overrepresented in the audiences of subsidized plays, or when subsidies go to a small elitist group of artists.

== Market for artworks ==
Two segments of the market in the visual arts can be distinguished: works of art that are familiar and have a history, and contemporary works that are more easily influenced by fashion and new discoveries. Both markets, however, are [[oligopoly|oligopolistic]], i.e., there are limited numbers of sellers and buyers ([[oligopsony]]). Two central questions on the working of the markets are: How are prices determined, and what is the [[rate of return|return]] on artworks, compared to the return on financial assets?

=== Price determination ===
Components of a work of art, like raw stone, tubes of paint or unpainted canvas, in general have a value much lower than the finished products, such as a sculpture or a finished painting. Also, the amount of labour needed to produce an item does not explain the big price differences between works of art. It seems that the value is much more dependent on potential buyers', and experts' perception of it. This perception has three elements: First, social value, which is the social status the buyer has by owning it. The artist thus has an "artistic capital". Second, the artistic value, compared to contemporary works, or as importance to later generations. Third, the price history of the item, if a buyer uses this for his expectation of a future price at which he might sell the item again (given the oligopolistic market structure).
Three kinds of economic agents determine these values. Specific experts like gallery owners or museum directors use the first, social value. Experts like art historians and art professors use the second, artistic value. Buyers who buy works of art as an investment use the third, the price history and expectations for future price increases.

=== Art market and investment ===
[[File:Asrlar Sadosi2012b.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fine art such as paintings are typically sold at [[auction]]s.]]
Some major financial institutions, banks and insurance companies, have had considerable return rates on investments in art works in the 1990s. These rates have not slowed down at the same time as the rates on [[stock exchange]]s, in the early 90's. This may indicate a [[diversification (finance)|diversification]] opportunity. Apart from this evidence of successful investment, the amount of data available has stimulated study of the market. Many works are sold on [[auction]]s. These transactions are thus very transparent. This has made it possible to establish price databases, with prices of some items going back to 1652. Empirical studies have shown that, on average, the [[rate of return|return]] on works of art has been lower than that on [[stock|equity]], with a [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] that is at least as high. An [[intangible asset|intangible]] gain in terms of pleasure of having a work of art could explain this partly. However, before interpreting the figures, it should be borne in mind that art is often exempt of many kinds of taxes. In 1986, Baumol made an estimate of an average yearly rate of return of 0.55 percent for works of art, against a rate of return of 2.5 percent for financial assets, over a 20-year period.

== Cultural industries ==
Some famous artworks such as the ''[[Mona Lisa]]'' painting are not reproducible (at least in the sense of creating another copy that would be seen as equivalent in value), but there are many cultural goods whose value does not depend on a single, individual copy. Books, recordings, movies get some of their value from the existence of many copies of the original. These are the products of major cultural industries, which are the book industry, the music industry and the film industry. These markets are characterized by:
* '''Uncertainty of value'''. The demand for a good (market success) is hard to predict. For example, with movies, even if a film's plot, themes and selection of actors has been extensively tested using focus groups and polls, and even if the movie uses popular [[A-list]] actors, this film may still be a [[box office bomb]] (e.g., ''[[Gigli]]'', a 2003 American romantic comedy starring [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]]). On the other hand, a low-budget film by an unknown director and an unknown cast, such as ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' can surprise the industry by being a major hit. This uncertainty is a characteristic of an [[experience good]] such as films, TV shows, musical theatre shows and music concerts.
* '''Infinite variety'''. You can differentiate between regular consumer products, e.g. cars, on basis of its characteristics. For example, a hatchback can be purchased from a number of manufacturers with a set list of options (e.g., automatic transmission, standard transmission, convertible, etc.), with the different options requiring different charges. Many general products allow classification on a relatively small number of such characteristics. Cultural goods, however, have a very high number of characteristics, which, on top of that, often are subjective. For example, an early 1990s band with loud, [[distortion (music)|distorted]] [[electric guitar]] could be considered to be [[grunge]], [[punk rock|punk]], [[heavy metal music]] or [[alternative rock]] by different [[music critic]]s.  This makes cultural products hard to compare.
* '''High concentration in the products which are traded or sold'''. A major part of sales of cultural goods is in a very small number of [[bestseller]]s (e.g., with books), [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]s (movies) or hit [[Single (music)|single]]s (pop music).
* '''Short [[product life cycle management|life cycle]]'''. Most cultural items are sold/traded shortly after their introduction or production. Some cultural goods, such as broadcast news, have little or no market value shortly after the broadcast. Of course, some cultural products may retain saleability for years or even decades, as with the small number of films that become [[cult movie]]s (e.g., ''[[Rocky Horror Picture Show]]'') or certain classic novels or albums that have enduring appeal (the "[[back catalogue]]" of a record label).
* '''High [[fixed cost]]s'''. There is high cost before introduction of a new artwork or cultural product. Making a movie can cost millions of dollars; however the marginal cost of making an additional copy of the DVD may cost less than a dollar.

=== Market structure ===
The important cultural industries tend to have an [[oligopolistic]] [[market structure]]. The market is dominated by a few major companies, with the rest of the market consisting of many small companies. The latter may act as a filter or as "gatekeepers" for the artistic supply. A small company with a successful artist or good quality roster can be bought by one of the major companies. Big conglomerates, pooling TV and film production, have existed for decades. The 1990s have seen some mergers extending beyond the industry as such, and mergers of hardware producers with content providers. Anticipated gains from [[synergy]] and [[market power]] have not been realised, and from the early 2000s there has been a trend towards organisation along sector lines.

== Economics of cultural heritage ==
[[Cultural heritage]] is reflected in goods and real estate. Management and [[regulatory economics|regulation]] of museums has come under study in this area.

=== Museums ===
[[File:The Otsuka Museum of Art20s3200.jpg|thumb|right200px|The [[Otsuka Museum of Art]] in Japan.]]
Museums, which have a conservatory role, and provide exhibitions to the general public, can be commercial, or on a non-profit base. In the second case, as they provide a [[public good]], they pose the problems related to these goods: should they be self-financing, or be subsidized ? One of the specific issues is the imbalance between the huge value of the collections in museums, and their budgets. Also, they are often located in places (city centres) where the cost of land is high, which limits their expansion possibilities. American museums exhibit only about half of their collection. Some museums in Europe, like the Pompidou Centre in France, show less than 5 percent of their collection. Apart from providing exhibitions, museums get proceeds from derived products, like catalogues and reproductions. They also produce at a more intangible level: They make collections. Out of so many pieces in the public domain, they make a selection based on their expertise, thus adding value to the mere existence of the items.

The dual goal of conservation and providing exhibitions obviously presents a choice. On the one hand the museum has, for conservation reasons, an interest in exhibiting as few items as possible, and it would select lesser known works and a specialized audience, to promote knowledge and research. On the other hand, the exhibition argument requires showing the major pieces from different cultures, to satisfy the demands from the public and to attract a large audience. When a government has made a choice about this, application of economic [[contract theory]] will help to implement this choice by showing how to use incentives to different managers (on the financial, conservatory side) to obtain the required result.

=== Real estate and buildings  ===
[[File:Wr Neustaedter Dom.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In many countries, historic buildings such as cathedrals are considered to be "heritage buildings" and as such they are protected against demolition or substantial modifications.]]
Many countries have systems that protect historically significant buildings and structures. These are buildings or other structures that are deemed to have cultural importance or which are deemed to have heritage value. Owners get tax deductions or subsidies for restoration, in return for which they accept restrictions on modifications to the buildings or provide public access. Buildings that are often classified as heritage buildings include former or current Parliament buildings, cathedrals, courthouses, houses built in a recognized historical style, and even fairly regular houses, if the house was formerly the home of a famous [[politician]], [[artist]] or inventor. Buildings with heritage status cannot typically be demolished. Depending on the nature of the heritage restrictions, the current owner may or may not be allowed to modify the outside or inside of the building. Such a system poses the same choice problems as museums do. There has been little study of this issue.

== Artists' labour market ==
The [[labour market]] for artists is characterized by:
* There is an '''extremely unequal [[income distribution]]''' within the market segment. A very small group of artists earn a high proportion of the total income, while the average income is low.
* There is a '''structural excess supply of labour'''. There are always more people who would like to earn their income as an artist than there is demand for artists and artworks. For example, there are far more young [[indie rock]] bands aspiring to careers in music than there are available paid contracts in the recording industry. Due to this excess supply of labour, a [[nightclub]] owner has so many local young bands requesting to play at her venue that she can offer them little or no payment for their performance.
* There are '''intangible returns to labour''', also called "nonpecuniary benefits" (this means non-financial, non-wage benefits). For example, a musician is able to spend her days creating beautiful music and working with other creative people, which is very satisfying. Due to these intangible returns, artists are often willing to accept lower wages than their qualifications would earn in a different market. For example, working with a famous musician may provide such great intangible benefits (e.g., it is exciting to meet and work with such a well-known performer) that a [[record producer]] may be able to ask musicians to record with the start musician for little or no payment.
* '''Non-separation of artist and work'''. While some workers in the cultural industries do not make a strong connection between their work tasks and their self-identity, for some types of artists, such as painters, sculptors and filmmakers, the image their artwork or creative output gives them is important to artists' sense of self. Whether this phenomenon occurs depends on a number of factors, such as the type of artistic job and individuals' perceptions. In the 2010s, many famous [[film director]]s view the movies they direct as directly identified with their artistic vision. However, an assistant director leading scenes in [[action film]]s may see him or herself as a worker in a cultural industry, and he/she may not feel artistically identified with the film's he/she works on.

=== Star system ===
[[File:Evan Rachel Wood (April 2009) 4.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Sherwin Rosen]] states that top stars have such high earnings because their movies sell more copies.]]
The term [[superstar (celebrity)|"star system"]], coined by [[Sherwin Rosen]], is used to explain why a very small number of the artists and creators in the market, such as the celebrity [[A-list]] actors and top [[pop singer]]s, earn most of the total earnings in a sector. Rosen's 1981 paper examined the economics of superstars to determine why “relatively small numbers of people earn enormous amounts of money and seem to dominate the fields in which they engage.” Rosen argues that in superstar markets, "small differences in talent at the top of the distribution will translate into large differences in revenue." Rosen points out that "...sellers of higher talent charge only slightly higher prices than those of lower talent, but sell much larger quantities; their greater earnings come overwhelmingly from selling larger quantities than from charging higher prices".

In cultural industries, the uncertainty about the quality of a product plays a key role in this. The consumer does not really know how good the product is, until he or she has consumed it (think of a movie), and the producer is confronted with the typical uncertainty in a cultural industry. The consumer looks for guidance in the price, reputation, or a famous name on the cover or poster. As the producer understands this using a famous director, actor or singer affects demand, he or she is prepared to pay a lot for a name considered a sign of quality (a star). Indeed, authors like Adler and Ginsburgh have given evidence that star status is determined by chance: in a musical contest, results were highly correlated with the order of performance. This randomness has been used to explain why the labor supply in the sector remains excessive: given the extreme gains of a star, and an irrational behaviour, or particular preferences, with respect to chance, unsuccessful artists keep trying, even when they are earning their money mostly in a different trade, such as waiting tables. A second argument is the possibility of intangible returns to artists' labour in terms of social status and lifestyle. For example, even a struggling [[DJ]] spends most of her time onstage on [[nightclub]]s and [[rave]]s, which for some people is a desirable outcome.

=== Production structure ===
[[File:Set design by Philippe Chaperon for Act4 sc2 of Aida by Verdi 1880 Paris.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A painter who does canvases that hang in major museums and a professional set painter for opera or theatre are both skilled painters who do painting for a living. However, the former is more likely to view her/his paintings as part of her artistic expression and identity, whereas the latter is more likely to view her/himself as a craftsperson.]]

A case has been made for the existence of a different structure in the production of cultural goods . (See [[Cultural Institutions Studies]].) An artist often considers a product to be an expression of himself, while the ordinary craftsperson is only concerned with his product, as far as it affects his/her pay or salary. For example, a painter who creates artworks that are displayed in museums may view her paintings as her artistic expression. On the other hand, a scene painter for a music theatre company may see herself as a craftsperson who is paid by the hour for doing painting. The artist may thus want restrict the use of his or her product, and he/she may object if a museum uses a reproduction of his/her painting to help sell cars or liquor. On the other hand, the scene painter may not object to commercial re-uses of her set painting, as she/he may see it just as a regular job.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21759">'''Educational robotics''' is a broad term that refers to a collection of activities, instructional programs, physical platforms, educational resources and pedagogical philosophy. There are many schools which are using the robot teacher. 

== Definition ==
The primary of objective of educational robotics is to provide a set of experience to facilitate the student's development of knowledge, skills and attitudes for the design, analysis, application and operation of robots.  The term robot here is used quite broadly and may include articulated robots, mobile robots or autonomous vehicles of any scale.   The rigor of the approach can be scaled based on the background of the target audience and may be suitable for students across the entire educational spectrum—from elementary school or graduate programs.

An alternate, or secondary, objective is to use robotics as a tangible and exciting application to motivate and facilitate the instruction other, often foundational, topics such as computer programming, artificial intelligence or engineering design.

==Education and training==
[[File:ER4u.jpg|thumb|The [[Intelitek|SCORBOT-ER 4u]] – educational robot.]]
Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.princetonreview.com/careers.aspx?cid=139 | title = Career: Robotics Engineer | accessdate = 2012-01-27 | year = 2012 | work = Princeton Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence and robotics among students. First-year computer science courses at several universities now include programming of a robot in addition to traditional software engineering-based coursework.&lt;ref name=MKG12&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://romisatriawahono.net/lecture/rm/survey/software%20engineering/Software%20Construction/Major%20-%20teaching%20novices%20programming%20using%20robots%20-%202012.pdf |title=Systematic Literature Review: Teaching Novices Programming using Robots |first1=L |last1=Major |first2=T |last2=Kyriacou |first3=O.P. |last3=Brereton |format=pdf |journal=IET Software |publisher=IEEE |volume=6 |issue=6 |pages=502-513 |doi=10.1049/iet-sen.2011.0125 |date=16 November 2012 |accessdate=April 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SG13&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.academia.edu/9656489/Enhancing_Practice_and_Achievement_in_Introductory_Programming_with_a_Robot_Olympics |title=Enhancing Practice and Achievement in Introductory Programming with a Robot Olympics |first1=Michael |last1=Scott |first2=Steve |last2=Counsell |first3=Stasha |last3=Lauria |first4=Stephen |last4=Swift |first5=Allan |last5=Tucker |first6=Martin |last6=Shepperd |first7=Gheorghita |last7=Ghinea |format=pdf |journal=IEEE Transactions on Education |publisher=IEEE |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=249–254 |doi=10.1109/TE.2014.2382567 |date=29 October 2015 |accessdate=January 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initiatives in schools===
[[File:Rero-robots.jpg|thumb|rero reconfigurable robots, designed as easy to assemble and easy to program]]
Since 2014, companies like Cytron Technologies has been making inroads into schools and learning centers with their rero reconfigurable robot.  Designed to be easy and safe to assemble and easy to program, robotics became very accessible to young children with no programming skills and even up to advance users at tertiary level.  Robotics education was heavily promoted via roadshows, science fairs, exhibitions, workshops, camps and co-sponsored classes, bringing robotics education to the masses.

===Post-secondary degree programs===
From approximately 1960 though 2005, robotics education at post-secondary institutions took place through elective courses, thesis experiences and design projects offered as part of degree programs in traditional academic disciplines, such as mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, industrial engineering or computer science.

Since 2005, more universities have begun granting degrees in robotics as a discipline in its own right, often under the name "Robotic Engineering".  Based on a 2015 web-based survey of robotics educators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7970162/ |title=The State of Robotics Education: Proposed Goals for Positively Transforming Robotics Education at Postsecondary Institutions |first1=Joel M. |last1=Esposito |journal=IEEE Robotics &amp; Automation Magazine  |publisher=IEEE |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=157-164 |doi=10.1109/MRA.2016.2636375 |date=September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the degree programs and their estimates annual graduates are listed alphabetically below.  Note that only official degree programs where the word "robotics" appears on the transcript or diploma are listed here; whereas degree programs in traditional disciplines with course concentrations or thesis topics related to robotics are deliberately omitted.

===Certification===
The [[Robotics Certification Standards Alliance|Robotics Certification Standards Alliance (RCSA)]] is an international robotics certification authority that confers various industry- and educational-related robotics certifications.

===Summer robotics camp===
Several summer camp programs include robotics as part of their core curriculum. In addition, youth summer robotics programs are frequently offered by celebrated museums such as the [[American Museum of Natural History]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 Education at American Museum of Natural History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102072036/http://www.amnh.org/education/students/offering.php?id=534 |date=2011-01-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Tech Museum of Innovation]] in Silicon Valley, CA, just to name a few.

===Robotics afterschool programs===
Many schools across the country are beginning to add robotics programs to their after school curriculum. Two main programs for afterschool robotics are [http://www.botball.org Botball] and [http://www.usfirst.org FIRST Robotics].

A work of art can be analyzed by considering a variety of aspects of it individually. These aspects are often called the '''elements of art'''.  A commonly used list of the main elements include form, shape, line, color, value, space and texture.

== Point ==
[[File:Stars in orion constellation.jpg|thumb|right|Stars in a constellation are a natural example of using points in a composition]]
A point is basically the beginning of “something” in “nothing”. It forces the mind to think upon its position and gives something to build upon in both imagination and space. Some abstract points in a group can provoke human imagination to link it with familiar shapes or forms.

== Line ==
[[Line (geometry)|Lines]] and [[curve]]s are marks that span a distance between two points (or the path of a moving point). As an element of visual art, line is the use of various marks, outlines, and implied lines during  artwork and design. A line has a width, direction, and length.&lt;ref name="getty" /&gt; A line's width is most times called its "thickness". Lines are sometimes called "strokes", especially when referring to lines in digital artwork.
[[File:Stars in orion constellation (connected).jpg|thumb|right|Similarly stars in a constellation connected via imaginary lines are a natural example of using lines in a composition]]

== Shape ==
Shape refers to a 2-dimensional, enclosed area. Shapes could be geometric, such as squares, circles, triangles etc. or organic and curvaceous.

== Form ==
The form of a work is its shape, including its volume or perceived volume. A [[Three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] artwork has depth as well as width and height. Three-dimensional form is the basis of [[sculpture]].&lt;ref name="getty"&gt;{{cite web|title = Understanding Formal Analysis|url = http://www.getty.edu/education/teachers/building_lessons/formal_analysis.html|publisher = Getty|accessdate = 9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Two-dimensional space|two-dimensional]] artwork can achieve the illusion of form with the use of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] and/or [[shading]] or modelling techniques.&lt;ref name="incredible art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elements and Principles of Design|url=http://www.incredibleart.org/files/elements2.htm|publisher=IncredibleArt.org|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Are the Elements of Art?|url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/reference/f/elements.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Formalism (art)|Formalism]] is the analysis of works by their form or shapes in [[art history]] or [[archeology]].

== Color ==
[[Color]] is the element of art that is produced when light, striking an object, is reflected back to the eye.&lt;ref name="getty" /&gt; There are three properties to color. The first is [[hue]], which simply means the name we give to a color (red, yellow, blue, green, etc.). The second property is intensity, which refers to the vividness of the color. A color's intensity is sometimes referred to as its "[[colorfulness]]", its "saturation", its "purity" or its "strength".The third and final property of color is its [[Value (colorimetry)|value]], meaning how light or dark it is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is Value in Art? |url=http://arthistory.about.com/cs/glossaries/g/v_value.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms [[Tints and shades|shade and tint]] refer to value changes in colors. In painting, shades are created by adding black to a color, while tints are created by adding white to a color.&lt;ref name="incredible art" /&gt;

== Space ==
Space is any conducive  area that an artist provides for a particular purpose.&lt;ref name="getty"/&gt; Space includes the background, foreground and middle ground, and refers to the distances or area(s) around, between, and within things. There are two kinds of space: [[negative space]] and positive space.&lt;ref name="oberlin"&gt;{{cite web|title = Vocabulary: Elements of Art, Principles of Art|url = http://www.oberlin.edu/amam/asia/sculpture/documents/vocabulary.pdf|publisher = Oberlin|accessdate = 9 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negative space is the area in between, around, through or within an object. Positive spaces are the areas that are occupied by an object and/or form.

==Texture==
Texture, another element of art, is used to describe how something feels or looks. There are many forms of texture; the two main forms are actual and visual. 

Visual texture is strictly two-dimensional and is perceived by the eye that makes it seem like the texture.

Actual texture (tactile texture) is one not only visible, but can be felt. It rises above the surface transitioning it from two-dimensional to three-dimensional. 

Some Examples: Furry, Bumpy, Smooth, Rough, Soft, Hard... etc... 

== Value ==
Value is the degree of lightness and darkness in a color. The difference in values is called contrast. Value can relate to shades, where a color gets darker by adding black to it, or tints, where a color gets lighter by adding white to it. White is considered the lightest value whereas black is the darkest. The middle value between these extremes is also known as a half-tone, all of which can be found on a value scale. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrawingsource.com/value-drawing.html|title=Value Drawing- The Key to Realism|last=Friedman|first=Marina|date=|website=The Drawing Source|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Environmental law}}

'''Environmental law''', also known as environmental '''and natural resources''' law, is a collective term describing the network of [[Treaty|treaties]], [[statute]]s, [[regulation]]s, [[common law|common]] and [[custom (law)|customary]] laws addressing the effects of human activity on the [[natural environment]]. The core environmental law regimes address environmental [[pollution]]. A related but distinct set of regulatory regimes, now strongly influenced by environmental legal principles, focus on the management of specific [[natural resources]], such as forests, minerals, or fisheries. Other areas, such as environmental impact assessment, may not fit neatly into either category, but are nonetheless important components of environmental law.&lt;section end=scope /&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of environmental law}}
Early examples of legal enactments designed to consciously preserve the environment, for its own sake or human enjoyment, are found throughout history. In the [[common law]], the primary protection was found in the law of [[Nuisance in English law|nuisance]], but this only allowed for private actions for damages or injunctions if there was harm to land. Thus smells emanating from [[pig sty|pig sties]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[Aldred's Case]]'' (1610) 9 Co Rep 57b; (1610) 77 ER 816&lt;/ref&gt; [[strict liability]] against dumping rubbish,&lt;ref&gt;''[[R v Stephens]]'' (1866) LR 1 QB 702&lt;/ref&gt; or damage from exploding dams.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Rylands v Fletcher]]'' [1868] UKHL 1&lt;/ref&gt; Private enforcement, however, was limited and found to be woefully inadequate to deal with major environmental threats, particularly threats to common resources. During the "[[Great Stink]]" of 1858, the dumping of sewerage into the [[River Thames]] began to smell so ghastly in the summer heat that Parliament had to be evacuated. Ironically, the [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers Act 1848]] had allowed the Metropolitan Commission for Sewers to close [[cesspit]]s around the city in an attempt to "clean up" but this simply led people to pollute the river. In 19 days, Parliament passed a further Act to build the [[London sewerage system]]. London also suffered from terrible [[air pollution]], and this culminated in the "[[Great Smog]]" of 1952, which in turn triggered its own legislative response: the [[Clean Air Act 1956]]. The basic regulatory structure was to set limits on emissions for households and business (particularly burning [[coal]]) while an inspectorate would enforce compliance.

Notwithstanding early analogues, the concept of "environmental law" as a separate and distinct body of law is a twentieth-century development.&lt;ref&gt;See generally R. Lazarus, [http://www.press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/M/bo3629140.html The Making of Environmental Law (Cambridge Press 2004)]; P. Gates, [http://www.arkansasresearch.com/HistReprints/GatesLandBook.htm History of Public Land Law Development].&lt;/ref&gt; The recognition that the natural environment was fragile and in need of special legal protections, the translation of that recognition into legal structures, the development of those structures into a larger body of "environmental law," and the strong influence of environmental law on natural resource laws, did not occur until about the 1960s. At that time, numerous influences - including a growing awareness of the unity and fragility of the [[biosphere]]; increased public concern over the impact of industrial activity on natural resources and human health; the increasing strength of the regulatory state; and more broadly the advent and success of [[environmental movement|environmentalism as a political movement]] - coalesced to produce a huge new body of law in a relatively short period of time. While the modern history of environmental law is one of continuing controversy, by the end of the twentieth century environmental law had been established as a component of the legal landscape in all [[Developed country|developed nations]] of the world, many [[Developing country|developing ones]], and the larger project of [[international law]].

===Chemical safety===
Chemical safety laws govern the use of [[chemicals]] in human activities, particularly man-made chemicals in modern industrial applications. As contrasted with media-oriented environmental laws (e.g., air or water quality laws), chemical control laws seek to manage the (potential) pollutants themselves. Regulatory efforts include banning specific chemical constituents in consumer products (e.g., [[Bisphenol A controversy|Bisphenol A]] in plastic bottles), and regulating [[pesticides]].

=== Wildlife and plants ===
Wildlife laws govern the potential impact of human activity on wild animals, whether directly on individuals or populations, or indirectly via habitat degradation. Similar laws may operate to protect plant species. Such laws may be enacted entirely to protect [[biodiversity]], or as a means for protecting species deemed important for other reasons. Regulatory efforts may including the creation of special [[conservation status]]es, prohibitions on killing, harming, or disturbing protected species, efforts to induce and support species recovery, establishment of wildlife refuges to support conservation, and prohibitions on trafficking in species or animal parts to combat [[poaching]].

=== Fish and game ===
{{Main article|Game law}}
{{Further|Fisheries law}}

Fish and game laws regulate the right to pursue and take or kill certain kinds of [[fish]] and [[wild animal]] ([[game (food)|game]]). Such laws may restrict the days to harvest fish or game, the number of animals caught per person, the species harvested, or the weapons or fishing gear used. Such laws may seek to balance dueling needs for preservation and harvest and to manage both [[Natural environment|environment]] and [[Population biology|populations]] of fish and game. Game laws can provide a legal structure to collect [[license]] fees and other [[Federal Duck Stamp|money]] which is used to fund [[Wildlife conservation|conservation]] efforts as well as to obtain harvest information used in [[wildlife management]] practice.

==Principles==
Environmental law has developed in response to emerging awareness of and concern over issues impacting the entire world. While laws have developed piecemeal and for a variety of reasons, some effort has gone into identifying key concepts and guiding principles common to environmental law as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;For example, the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) has identified eleven "emerging principles and concepts" in international environmental law, derived from the [[Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment|1972 Stockholm Conference]], the [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|1992 Rio Declaration]], and more recent developments. UNEP, [http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf Training Manual on International Environmental Law] (Chapter 3).&lt;/ref&gt; The principles discussed below are not an exhaustive list and are not universally recognized or accepted. Nonetheless, they represent important principles for the understanding of environmental law around the world.

=== Sustainable development ===
{{Main article|Sustainable development}}
Defined by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] as "development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs," [[sustainable development]] may be considered together with the concepts of "integration" (development cannot be considered in isolation from sustainability) and "interdependence" (social and economic development, and environmental protection, are interdependent).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 12-19.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws mandating [[environmental impact assessment]] and requiring or encouraging development to minimize environmental impacts may be assessed against this principle.

The modern concept of sustainable development was a topic of discussion at the 1972 [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]] (Stockholm Conference), and the driving force behind the 1983 [[World Commission on Environment and Development]] (WCED, or Bruntland Commission). In 1992, the first UN [[Earth Summit]] resulted in the [[Rio Declaration]], Principle 3 of which reads: "The right to development must be fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future generations." Sustainable development has been a core concept of international environmental discussion ever since, including at the [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] (Earth Summit 2002), and the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]] (Earth Summit 2012, or Rio+20).

=== Equity ===
{{Further|Intergenerational equity}}
Defined by UNEP to include intergenerational equity - "the right of future generations to enjoy a fair level of the common patrimony" - and intragenerational equity - "the right of all people within the current generation to fair access to the current generation's entitlement to the Earth's natural resources" - environmental equity considers the present generation under an obligation to account for long-term impacts of activities, and to act to sustain the global environment and resource base for future generations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 20-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollution control and resource management laws may be assessed against this principle.

=== Transboundary responsibility ===
Defined in the international law context as an obligation to protect one's own environment, and to prevent damage to neighboring environments, UNEP considers transboundary responsibility at the international level as a potential limitation on the rights of the [[sovereign state]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 24-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Laws that act to limit [[externalities]] imposed upon human health and the environment may be assessed against this principle.

=== Public participation and transparency ===
Identified as essential conditions for "accountable governments,...  industrial concerns," and organizations generally, public participation and transparency are presented by UNEP as requiring "effective protection of the human right to hold and express opinions and to seek, receive and impart ideas,... a right of access to appropriate, comprehensible and timely information held by governments and industrial concerns on economic and social policies regarding the sustainable use of natural resources and the protection of the environment, without imposing undue financial burdens upon the applicants and with adequate protection of privacy and business confidentiality," and "effective judicial and administrative proceedings." These principles are present in [[environmental impact assessment]], laws requiring publication and access to relevant environmental data, and [[administrative procedure]].

=== Precautionary principle ===
{{Main article|Precautionary principle}}
One of the most commonly encountered and controversial principles of environmental law, the [[Rio Declaration]] formulated the precautionary principle as follows:

:In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation.

The principle may play a role in any debate over the need for environmental regulation.

=== Prevention ===
:The concept of prevention . . . can perhaps better be considered an overarching aim that gives rise to a multitude of legal mechanisms, including prior assessment of environmental harm, licensing or authorization that set out the conditions for operation and the consequences for violation of the conditions, as well as the adoption of strategies and policies. Emission limits and other product or process standards, the use of best available techniques and similar techniques can all be seen as applications of the concept of prevention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual], ¶¶ 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Polluter pays principle ===
{{Main article|Polluter pays principle}}
The polluter pays principle stands for the idea that "the environmental costs of economic activities, including the cost of preventing potential harm, should be internalized rather than imposed upon society at large."&lt;ref&gt;[[Rio Declaration]] Principle 16; [http://www.unep.org/environmentalgovernance/Portals/8/documents/training_Manual.pdf UNEP Manual] ¶ 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  All issues related to responsibility for cost for [[environmental remediation]] and compliance with pollution control regulations involve this principle.

==Theory==
Environmental law is a continuing source of controversy. Debates over the necessity, fairness, and cost of environmental regulation are ongoing, as well as regarding the appropriateness of regulations vs. market solutions to achieve even agreed-upon ends.

Allegations of scientific uncertainty fuel the [[Global warming controversy|ongoing debate]] over greenhouse gas regulation, and are a major factor in debates over whether to ban particular pesticides.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[DDT]].&lt;/ref&gt; In cases where the science is well-settled, it is not unusual to find that corporations intentionally hide or distort the facts, or sow confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2010/0622/Merchants-of-Doubt|title=Merchants of Doubt|author=The Christian Science Monitor|date=22 June 2010|work=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common for regulated industry to argue against environmental regulation on the basis of cost.&lt;ref&gt;In the United States, estimates of environmental regulation total costs reach 2% of [[GDP]]. See [http://www.rff.org/Documents/RFF-DP-03-06.pdf Pizer &amp; Kopp, Calculating the Costs of Environmental Regulation, 1 (2003 Resources for the Future)].&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties arise in performing [[cost-benefit analysis]] of environmental issues.  It is [[Ecosystem valuation|difficult to quantify]] the value of an environmental value such as a healthy ecosystem, clean air, or species diversity. Many environmentalists' response to pitting economy vs. ecology is summed up by former Senator and founder of [[Earth Day]] [[Gaylord Nelson]], "The economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of the environment, not the other way around."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Earth Day: Fulfilling the Promise|first=Gaylord|last=Nelson|date=November 2002|publisher=Wisconsin Press|url=http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/2095.htm|isbn=0-299-18040-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, environmental issues are seen by many as having an [[Environmental ethics|ethical or moral]] dimension, which would transcend financial cost. Even so, there are some efforts underway to systemically recognize environmental costs and assets, and account for them properly in economic terms.

While affected industries spark controversy in fighting regulation, there are also many environmentalists and public interest groups who believe that current regulations are inadequate, and advocate for stronger protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/science-nature/can-world-really-set-aside-half-planet-wildlife-180952379/|title=Can the World Really Set Aside Half of the Planet for Wildlife?|publisher=Smithsonian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/news/2016/03/09/climate-coalition-vows-peaceful-escalated-actions-until-we-break-free-fossil-fuels|title=Climate Coalition Vows 'Peaceful, Escalated' Actions Until 'We Break Free from Fossil Fuels'|work=Common Dreams}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2006/03/guide-environmental-non-profits|title=A Guide to Environmental Non-Profits|work=Mother Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Environmental law conferences - such as the annual [[University of Oregon School of Law#Public Interest Environmental Law Conference|Public Interest Environmental Law Conference]] in Eugene, Oregon - typically have this focus, also connecting environmental law with class, race, and other issues.

An additional debate is to what extent environmental laws are fair to all regulated parties. For instance, researchers Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg highlight how smaller organizations can often incur disproportionately larger costs as a result of environmental regulations, which can ultimately create an additional barrier to entry for new firms, thus stifling competition and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Teeter|first=Preston|last2=Sandberg|first2=Jorgen|date=2016|title=Constraining or Enabling Green Capability Development? How Policy Uncertainty Affects Organizational Responses to Flexible Environmental Regulations|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-8551.12188/full|journal=British Journal of Management|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1111/1467-8551.12188|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Around the world==

===International law===
{{Further|Environmental protocol}}
Global and regional environmental issues are increasingly the subject of [[international law]]. Debates over environmental concerns implicate core principles of international law and have been the subject of numerous international agreements and declarations.

[[Customary international law]] is an important source of international environmental law.  These are the norms and rules that countries follow as a matter of custom and they are so prevalent that they bind all states in the world.  When a principle becomes customary law is not clear cut and many arguments are put forward by states not wishing to be bound.  Examples of customary international law relevant to the environment include the duty to warn other states promptly about icons of an environmental nature and environmental damages to which another state or states may be exposed, and Principle 21 of the Stockholm Declaration ('good neighbourliness' or sic utere).

Numerous [[List of international environmental agreements|legally binding international agreements]] encompass a wide variety of issue-areas, from terrestrial, marine and atmospheric pollution through to wildlife and biodiversity protection. International environmental agreements are generally [[Multilateral treaty|multilateral]] (or sometimes [[Bilateral treaty|bilateral]]) [[Treaty|treaties]] (a.k.a. convention, agreement, protocol, etc.). [[Treaty#Protocols|Protocols]] are subsidiary agreements built from a primary treaty. They exist in many areas of international law but are especially useful in the environmental field, where they may be used to regularly incorporate recent scientific knowledge. They also permit countries to reach agreement on a framework that would be contentious if every detail were to be agreed upon in advance.  The most widely known protocol in international environmental law is the [[Kyoto Protocol]], which followed from the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]].

While the bodies that proposed, argued, agreed upon and ultimately adopted existing international agreements vary according to each agreement, certain conferences, including 1972's [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], 1983's [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]], 1992's [[Earth Summit (1992)|United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] and 2002's [[Earth Summit 2002|World Summit on Sustainable Development]] have been particularly important. [[Multilateral environmental agreement]]s sometimes create an International Organization, Institution or Body responsible for implementing the agreement. Major examples are the [[Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]] (CITES) and the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN).

International environmental law also includes the opinions of international courts and tribunals. While there are few and they have limited authority, the decisions carry much weight with legal commentators and are quite influential on the development of international environmental law. One of the biggest challenges in international decisions is to determine an adequate compensation for environmental damages.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman Reis, T., ''Compensation for Environmental Damages Under International Law'', Kluwer Law International, The Hague, 2011, {{ISBN|978-90-411-3437-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The courts include the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ), the international Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS), the [[European Court of Justice]], [[European Court of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/0C818E19-C40B-412E-9856-44126D49BDE6/0/FICHES_Environment_EN.pdf |title=ECtHR case-law factsheet on environment |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110114815/http://www.echr.coe.int/NR/rdonlyres/0C818E19-C40B-412E-9856-44126D49BDE6/0/FICHES_Environment_EN.pdf |archivedate=2012-11-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and other regional treaty tribunals.

=== Africa ===
According to the [[International Network for Environmental Compliance and Enforcement]] (INECE), the major environmental issues in Africa are “drought and [[flood]]ing, air pollution, [[deforestation]], [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], freshwater availability, degradation of soil and vegetation, and widespread poverty.” &lt;ref name=INECE&gt;{{cite web |title=INECE Regions- Africa |url=http://www.inece.org/region_africa.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820012452/http://www.inece.org/region_africa.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=20 August 2002 |accessdate=18 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) is focused on the “growing urban and industrial pollution, water quality, [[electronic waste]] and indoor air from cookstoves.” &lt;ref name=EPA&gt;{{cite web|title=Africa International Programs|url=http://www.epa.gov/international/regions/Africa/|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They hope to provide enough aid on concerns regarding pollution before their impacts contaminate the African environment as well as the global environment.  By doing so, they intend to “protect human health, particularly vulnerable populations such as children and the poor.” &lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;  In order to accomplish these goals in Africa, EPA programs are focused on strengthening the ability to enforce environmental laws as well as public compliance to them.  Other programs work on developing stronger environmental laws, regulations, and standards.&lt;ref name="EPA"/&gt;

===Asia===
The Asian Environmental Compliance and Enforcement Network (AECEN) is an agreement between 16 Asian countries dedicated to improving cooperation with environmental laws in Asia. These countries include Cambodia, China, Indonesia, India, Maldives, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, Philippines, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Vietnam, and Lao PDR.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = AECEN|url = http://www.aecen.org/|website = www.aecen.org|accessdate = 2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Union ===
The [[European Union]] issues secondary legislation on environmental issues that are valid throughout the EU (so called regulations) and many directives that must be implemented into national legislation from the 28 member states (national states). Examples are the Regulation (EC) No. 338/97 on the implementation of CITES; or the Natura 2000 network the centerpiece for nature &amp; biodiversity policy, encompassing the bird Directive (79/409/EEC/ changed to 2009/147/EC)and the habitats directive (92/43/EEC). Which are made up of multiple SACs (Special Areas of Conservation, linked to the habitats directive) &amp; SPAs (Special Protected Areas, linked to the bird directive), throughout Europe.

EU legislation is ruled in Article 249 Treaty for the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). Topics for common EU legislation are:

* Climate change
* Air pollution
* Water protection and management
* Waste management
* Soil protection
* Protection of nature, species and biodiversity
* Noise pollution
* Cooperation for the environment with third countries (other than EU member states)
* Civil protection

=== Middle East ===
The U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]] is working with countries in the [[Middle East]] to improve “environmental governance, water pollution and water security, clean fuels and vehicles, public participation, and pollution prevention.”&lt;ref name="Middle East"&gt;{{cite web|title=EPA Middle East|url=http://www.epa.gov/oia/regions/Mideast/index.html|publisher=Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oceania===
The main concerns on environmental issues in the Oceanic Region are “illegal releases of air and water [[pollutant]]s, [[illegal logging]]/timber trade, illegal shipment of [[hazardous waste]]s, including [[e-waste]] and ships slated for destruction, and insufficient institutional structure/lack of enforcement capacity”.&lt;ref name="INECE Asia"&gt;{{cite web |title=INECE Regions - Asia and the Pacific |url=http://www.inece.org/region_asia.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021217145241/http://inece.org/region_asia.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=December 17, 2002 |accessdate=October 18, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sprep.org/ Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environmental Programme (SPREP)]&lt;/ref&gt;  is an international organization between Australia, the Cook Islands, FMS, Fiji, France, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, New Zealand, Niue, Palau, PNG, Samoa, Solomon Island, Tonga, Tuvalu, USA, and Vanuatu.

=== Australia ===
The [[Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999]] is the center piece of environmental legislation in the Australian Government. It sets up the “legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places”.&lt;ref name=Australia&gt;{{cite web|title=EPBC Act|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/epbc/index.html|accessdate=October 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It also focuses on protecting world heritage properties, national heritage properties, wetlands of international importance, nationally threatened species and ecological communities, migratory species, Commonwealth marine areas, [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park]], and the environment surrounding nuclear activities.&lt;ref name="Australia"/&gt; ''Commonwealth v Tasmania'' (1983), also known as the "Tasmanian Dam Case", is the most influential case for Australian environmental law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/cth/HCA/1983/21.html Commonwealth v Tasmania] (1983) 158 CLR 1 (1 July 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
The Brazilian government created the [[Ministry of the Environment (Brazil)|Ministry of Environment]] in 1992 in order to develop better strategies of protecting the environment, use natural resources sustainably, and enforce public environmental policies.  The Ministry of Environment has authority over policies involving environment, water resources, preservation, and environmental programs involving the Amazon.&lt;ref name=Brazil&gt;{{cite web|title=Apresentação|url=http://www.mma.gov.br/o-ministerio/apresentacao|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
The [[Department of the Environment Act]] establishes the [[Department of the Environment (Canada)|Department of the Environment]] in the Canadian government as well as the position [[Minister of the Environment (Canada)|Minister of the Environment]].  Their duties include “the preservation and enhancement of the quality of the natural environment, including water, air and soil quality; renewable resources, including migratory birds and other non-domestic flora and fauna; water; meteorology;"&lt;ref name="Department of the Environment Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of the Environment Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/E-10/page-1.html|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999|Environmental Protection Act]] is the main piece of Canadian environmental legislation that was put into place March 31, 2000. The Act focuses on “respecting pollution prevention and the protection of the environment and human health in order to contribute to sustainable development."&lt;ref name="CEPA Canada"&gt;{{cite web|title=Environment Canada|url=http://www.ec.gc.ca/lcpe-cepa/default.asp?lang=En|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other principle federal statutes include the  [[Canadian Environmental Assessment Act]], and the [[Species at Risk Act]]. When provincial and federal legislation are in conflict federal legislation takes precedence, that being said individual provinces can have their own legislation such as Ontario's [[Environmental Bill of Rights]], and [[Clean Water Act (Ontario)|Clean Water Act]].&lt;ref&gt;See [https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=laws_canada_legal Canada's Legal System Overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822000216/https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=laws_canada_legal |date=2017-08-22 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== China ===
{{See also|Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China}}
According to the U.S. [[Environmental Protection Agency]], "China has been working with great determination in recent years to develop, implement, and enforce a solid environmental law framework. Chinese officials face critical challenges in effectively implementing the laws, clarifying the roles of their national and provincial governments, and strengthening the operation of their legal system."&lt;ref&gt;EPA, [http://www.epa.gov/ogc/china/initiative_home.htm China Environmental Law Initiative].&lt;/ref&gt; Explosive economic and industrial growth in China has led to [[Environmental issues in China|significant environmental degradation]], and China is currently in the process of developing more stringent legal controls.&lt;ref&gt;Vermont Law School, [http://www.vermontlaw.edu/academics/environmental_law_center/institutes_and_initiatives/us-china_partnership_for_environmental_law/overview.htm China Partnership for Environmental Law] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720164123/http://www.vermontlaw.edu/academics/environmental_law_center/institutes_and_initiatives/us-china_partnership_for_environmental_law/overview.htm |date=2012-07-20 }}; C.

=== Ecuador ===
With the enactment of the [[2008 Constitution of Ecuador|2008 Constitution]], [[Ecuador]] became the first country in the world to codify the [[Rights of Nature]]. The Constitution, specifically Articles 10 and 71-74, recognizes the inalienable rights of [[ecosystem]]s to exist and flourish, gives people the authority to petition on the behalf of ecosystems, and requires the government to remedy violations of these rights. The rights approach is a break away from traditional environmental regulatory systems, which regard nature as property and legalize and manage degradation of the environment rather than prevent it.&lt;ref name="Celdf"&gt;Community Environmental Legal Defense Fund (CELDF). 2008. http://www.celdf.org/, accessed April, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Rights of Nature articles in Ecuador's constitution are part of a reaction to a combination of political, economic, and social phenomena. Ecuador's abusive past with the [[oil industry]], most famously the [[Chevron Corporation#Environmental damage in Ecuador|class-action litigation]] against [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]], and the failure of an extraction-based economy and [[neoliberal]] reforms to bring economic prosperity to the region has resulted in the election of a New Leftist regime, led by President [[Rafael Correa]], and sparked a demand for new approaches to development. In conjunction with this need, the principle of "Buen Vivir," or good living—focused on social, environmental and spiritual wealth versus material wealth—gained popularity among citizens and was incorporated into the new constitution.&lt;ref name="Gudynas"&gt;Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447.&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of indigenous groups, from whom the concept of "Buen Vivir" originates, in the forming of the constitutional ideals also facilitated the incorporation of the Rights of Nature as a basic tenet of their culture and conceptualization of "Buen Vivir." &lt;ref name="Becker"&gt;Becker, Marc. 2011 Correa, Indigenous Movements, and the Writing of a New Constitution in Ecuador. ''[[Latin American Perspectives]]'' 38(1):47-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egypt ===
The [[Environmental Protection Law (Egypt)|Environmental Protection Law]] outlines the responsibilities of the Egyptian government to “preparation of draft legislation and decrees pertinent to environmental management, collection of data both nationally and internationally on the state of the environment, preparation of periodical reports and studies on the state of the environment, formulation of the national plan and its projects, preparation of environmental profiles for new and urban areas, and setting of standards to be used in planning for their development, and preparation of an annual report on the state of the environment to be prepared to the President."&lt;ref name=Egypt&gt;{{cite web|title=Law 4|url=http://www.eeaa.gov.eg/English/main/law4.asp|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== India ===
{{main|Indian environmental law}}
In India, Environmental law is governed by the Environment Protection Act, 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = THE ENVIRONMENT (PROTECTION) ACT, 1986|url = http://envfor.nic.in/legis/env/env1.html|website = envfor.nic.in|accessdate = 2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; This act is enforced by the Central Pollution Control Board and the numerous State Pollution Control Boards. Apart from this, there are also individual legislations specifically enacted for the protection of Water, Air, Wildlife, etc. Such legislations include :- 
*The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974
*The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act, 1977
*The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980
*The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1981

=== Japan ===
The [[Basic Environmental Law]] is the basic structure of Japan’s environmental policies replacing the [[Basic Law for Environmental Pollution Control]] and the [[Nature Conservation Law]]. The updated law aims to address “global environmental problems, urban pollution by everyday life, loss of accessible natural environment in urban areas and degrading environmental protection capacity in forests and farmlands.”&lt;ref name=Japan&gt;{{cite web|title=The Basic Environment Law|url=http://www.env.go.jp/en/laws/policy/basic/leaflet2.html|accessdate=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three basic environmental principles that the Basic Environmental Law follows are “the blessings of the environment should be enjoyed by the present generation and succeeded to the future generations, a sustainable society should be created where environmental loads by human activities are minimized, and Japan should contribute actively to global environmental conservation through international cooperation.”&lt;ref name="Japan"/&gt;
From these principles, the Japanese government have established policies such as “environmental consideration in policy formulation, establishment of the Basic Environment Plan which describes the directions of long-term environmental policy, environmental impact assessment for development projects, economic measures to encourage activities for reducing environmental load, improvement of social infrastructure such as sewerage system, transport facilities etc., promotion of environmental activities by corporations, citizens and NGOs, environmental education, and provision of information, promotion of science and technology."&lt;ref name="Japan"/&gt;

=== New Zealand ===
{{Main article|New Zealand environmental law}}

The [[Ministry for the Environment (New Zealand)|Ministry for the Environment]] and [[Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment|Office of the Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment]] were established by the [[Environment Act 1986]]. These positions are responsible for advising the Minister on all areas of environmental legislation.  A common theme of New Zealand’s environmental legislation is sustainably managing natural and physical resources, fisheries, and forests.  The [[Resource Management Act 1991]] is the main piece of environmental legislation that outlines the government’s strategy to managing the “environment, including air, water soil, biodiversity, the coastal environment, noise, subdivision, and land use planning in general.”&lt;ref name="New Zealand"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry for the Environment|url=http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/|accessdate=23 October 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121130140120/http://www.mfe.govt.nz/laws/|archivedate=30 November 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Russia ===
The [[Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment]] of the Russian Federation makes regulation regarding “conservation of natural resources, including the subsoil, water bodies, forests located in designated conservation areas, fauna and their habitat, in the field of hunting, hydrometeorology and related areas, environmental monitoring and pollution control, including radiation monitoring and control, and functions of public environmental policy making and implementation and statutory regulation."&lt;ref name=Russia&gt;{{cite web|title=Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment of the Russian Federation|url=http://www.mnr.gov.ru/english/|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Other uses|First contact (disambiguation)}}

In anthropology, '''first contact''' is the first meeting of two [[cultures]] previously unaware of one another.{{sfn|Scuppin|2014|page= 1}}&lt;ref name="Tcherkezoff2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Serge Tcherkezoff|title=First Contacts in Polynesia - the Samoan Case (1722-1848): Western Misunderstandings about Sexuality and Divinity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tVIduk23-BMC&amp;pg=PA1|date=1 August 2008|publisher=ANU E Press|isbn=978-1-921536-02-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BellBrown2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Joshua A. Bell|author2=Alison K. Brown|author3=Robert J. Gordon|title=Recreating First Contact: Expeditions, Anthropology, and Popular Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKxqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT128|date=6 November 2013|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-1-935623-24-3|page=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable examples of first contact are those between the [[Spanish Empire]] and the [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] (and ultimately all of the [[Americas]]) in 1492; and the [[Aboriginal Australians]] with Europeans in 1788 when the [[First Fleet]] arrived in [[Sydney]].{{sfn|Scuppin|2014|page= 1}}

Such contact is sometimes described as a "[[Discovery (observation)|discovery]]", such as the British and United States did with the legal theory using a "[[Doctrine of Discovery]].&lt;ref name="Harjo2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Suzan Shown Harjo|title=Nation to Nation: Treaties Between the United States and American Indian Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fqpqBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT39|date=30 September 2014|publisher=Smithsonian|isbn=978-1-58834-479-3|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally the more technologically complex society that is able to travel to new geographic regions to make contact with those more isolated, less technologically developed societies.&lt;ref name="Stockard2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean Stockard|title=Sociology: Discovering Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QPXVm_VpZT8C|year=2000|publisher=Wadsworth|page= 512|isbn=978-0-534-56521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some object to the application of such a word to human beings, which is why "first contact" is generally preferred. The use of the term "discovery" tends to occur more in reference to [[geography]] than cultures; for an example of a common discovery debate, see [[Discoverer of the Americas]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

== Consequences ==
The [[historical]] record indicates that when one culture is significantly more [[technologically]] advanced than the other, this side will be favored by the disruptive nature of conflict, often with dire consequences for the other society. However the introduction of [[disease]] plays a critical role in this process. More isolated peoples who lived across broader territories in low density succumbed to the illnesses brought from the comparatively higher density of Europe. The Indigenous populations simply had not had the time to develop immunity to the multiple foreign diseases, all introduced at once, for which the more urbanised European populations had had many years to develop some population immunity to.&lt;ref&gt;http://rdcu.be/vwH4&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this process was enhanced via the [[Native_American_disease_and_epidemics#Disease_as_a_weapon_against_Native_Americans|colonisers' intentional spread of disease as a biological weapon]], one notable example of this being in North America with the colonisers giving Native American tribes smallpox-infested blankets as gifts. 

Marshall Sahlins' work [https://books.google.com.au/books/about/Islands_of_History.html?id=ScuTytmgE6MC Islands of History] uses an ethnohistorical perspective to attempt to come to grips with the way that non-European peoples saw the first contact phenomenon. In it he argues that native people, while being changed by contact with Europeans, nonetheless did so through their own cultural frame of reference.

'''General chemistry'''
(sometimes called "gen chem" for short) is a course often taught at the high school and introductory university level. It is intended to serve as a broad introduction to a variety of concepts in [[chemistry]] and is widely taught. At the university level, it is also sometimes used as a "weed out" course for disciplines (sometimes related, sometimes not) which are perceived to require a high level of intellectual rigor or large course loads. It is also one of the few chemistry courses in most universities that does not explicitly explore a particular discipline such as [[organic chemistry]] or [[analytical chemistry]].

General chemistry courses typically introduce concepts such as [[stoichiometry]], prediction of reaction products, [[thermodynamics]], [[nuclear chemistry]], [[electrochemistry]], [[chemical kinetics]], and many of the rudiments of [[physical chemistry]]. Though the list of subjects covered is typically broad, leading some to criticize both the class and the discipline as encouraging memorization, most general chemistry courses are firmly grounded in several fundamental physical rules for which the primary challenge is understanding when the rules are applicable.

== Concepts Taught ==
The concepts taught in a typical general chemistry course are as follows:
*[[Stoichiometry]]
*[[Conservation of energy]]
*[[Conservation of mass]]
*[[Atom|Elementary atomic theory]]
*[[Periodic table|Periodic table and periodicity]]
*[[Law of constant composition]]
*[[Gas law]]s
*[[Nuclear chemistry]]
*[[Solubility]]
*[[Acid-base chemistry]]
*[[Chemical bonding]]
*[[Chemical kinetics]]
*[[Thermodynamics]]
*[[Electrochemistry]]
*[[Chemical equilibrium|Chemical equilibria]]

A system of IOELVs was first introduced in 1980 by [[directive 80/1107/EEC]] but the first list of 27 substances was not  created until '''directive 91/322/EC''' in 1991. Member states had until 31 December 1993 to implement national limits. This first list was amended by directive 2006/15/EC in 2006 which transferred 10 of the 27 to a different regulatory regime. A second list was defined in directive 96/94/EEC but this was [[repeal]]ed by directive 2000/39/EC.&lt;ref name="dd"&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''189&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, directive 80/1107/EEC was repealed and replaced by a new regime under the chemical agents directive ([[directive 98/24/EC]]). The directive defines '''occupational exposure limit value''' as "the limit of the time-[[weighted average]] of the [[concentration]] of a chemical agent in the [[air]] within the [[breathing zone]] of a worker over a specified reference period."&lt;ref&gt;Art.2(d)&lt;/ref&gt; Article 3 of the directive led to the creation of the [[Scientific Committee on Occupational Exposure Limit Values]] to advise the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Dikshith &amp; Diwan (2003) ''p.''190&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Official Journal of the European Union]] [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31995D0320:EN:HTML L 188, 9.8.1995, p.14-15]&lt;/ref&gt; There have subsequently been two directives establishing further lists of IOELVs: 2000/39/EC and 2006/15/EC. {{As of|2008}}, the IOELVs under '''directive 91/322/EC''' remain in force but under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | author=European Commission | work=Health and Safety at Work | publisher=Employment and Social Affairs | accessdate=2008-04-24 | url=http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | title=Occupational Exposure Limits and Biological Limit Values | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080416032949/http://ec.europa.eu/employment_social/health_safety/occupational_en.htm | archivedate=2008-04-16 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A third list of IOELVs, now under directive 98/24/EC, is expected in the first half of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/aboutus/europe/euronews/dossiers/ioelv3.htm | publisher=[[Health and Safety Executive]] | title=Third list of indicative occupational exposure limit values (IOELVs) (98/24/EC) | work=On the Horizon | year=2008 | accessdate=2009-04-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7914">The '''Institute for International and Cross-Cultural Psychology''' (IICCP) at [[St. Francis College]], [[New York City]] was founded in 1998. During its 21 years of existence it has become known for the advancement of [[cross-cultural psychology]] and [[international psychology]]. Supported by an International Advisory Board of psychologists from six countries, members of the institute have engaged in a series of research projects, edited books on a broad variety of topics in international psychology, sponsored numerous conferences, symposia and colloquia, given lectures at many conferences and institutions around the world, and introduced innovative curriculum development.

==Objectives==
The Institute's objectives are: (1) to sponsor research and publications in international and cross-cultural psychology; (2) to help internationalize the teaching of psychology; (3) to create a network of ties with other interested psychological institutions in the US and abroad; (4) to promote cross-cultural awareness at Saint Francis College by developing courses, workshops, symposia, and conferences; (5) to involve students in cross-cultural research; and (6) to foster a sense of appreciation of the cultural richness in the [[St. Francis College]] community.

==Activities==
Each year the International Psychology Division (52) of the American Psychological Association offers the Ursula Gielen Global Psychology Book Award, with IICCP members playing an important role in selecting the award winner.  The award is presented to the author(s) or editor(s) of a recent book that makes the greatest contribution to psychology as an international discipline and profession, or more specifically, the degree to which the book adds to our understanding of global phenomena and problems from a psychological point of view.

The Director of the Institute, Uwe P. Gielen, received his Ph.D. in social psychology from [[Harvard University]].  His work has centered on [[cross-cultural psychology]] and [[international psychology]], moral development in diverse cultures,  Chinese American youths' and young adults' development, and [[Tibet]]an studies.  He is a former president of the International Council of Psychologists (ICP), the Society for Cross-Cultural Research (SCCR), and the American Psychological Association’s International Psychology Division, and has given some 350 presentations in 34 countries.

The Institute's Director for Student Affairs, Renée Goodstein, received her Ph.D. from Fordham University. She practices psychotherapy with a specialization in multiculturalism and is actively involved in efforts to reduce intergroup tensions and prejudice.

The Institute's Director for Research Projects, Sunghun Kim, received his Ph.D. from The University of Texas-Austin. He is a specialist in cross-cultural psychology and in methodology. 

==Research and Publications ==

Ongoing research and book projects at the institute include the following:
Growing up Chinese in New York City; Asian Families in North America;  and Immigrants from around the World. 

The Institute has sponsored the editing and writing of 23 volumes and more than 90 articles on cross-cultural and international topics during the last 18 years. Between 1998 and 2003 the Institute supported the editing of the International Journal of Group Tensions, a journal sponsored by the International Society for the Study of Group Tensions.

The ''DVD: International Psychology: Perspectives and Profiles'' (Judy Kuriansky, Teacher's College Columbia University and Uwe P. Gielen), which is supported by the International Division of the American Psychological Association, introduces students and others to the field of international psychology. It includes interviews with prominent international psychologists and interested students. The DVD is available free of charge from IICCP.

{{Islam |culture}}

The topic of '''Islam and children''' includes the rights of children in [[Islam]], the duties of children towards their parents, and the rights of parents over their children, both biological and [[Fosterage|foster children]]. Also discussed are some of the differences regarding rights with respect to different schools of thought.

== Muhammad ==

Muhammad established laws and examples (''[[sunnah]]'') in respect of which is obligatory for the [[Ummah|Muslim community]] to follow.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

Muhammad had [[Children of Muhammad|seven children]], three boys and four girls. All his sons, including [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad]], died in infancy. Because of this, his experience as a father is sometimes described as "sorrowful".&lt;ref name=stewart113/&gt; Muhammad also had an adopted son, Zayd, who is said to be the object of Muhammad's parental affection.&lt;ref name=Watt230/&gt; He also had two grandsons, [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan]] and [[Hussein ibn Ali|Hussein]], and three granddaughters, [[Umm Kulthum bint Ali|Umm Kulthum]], [[Zaynab bint Ali|Zaynab]] and [[Umamah bint Zainab|Umamah]].&lt;ref name=stewart113&gt;Stewart, p.113&lt;/ref&gt; In one Islamic tradition, Muhammad ran after Hussein in a game until he caught him.&lt;ref name=Yust723/&gt; Muhammad used to let Umamah sit on his shoulders while he was praying. When someone expressed astonishment at the Prophet when the Prophet kissed his grandchild, he responded, "what can I do if God has deprived your heart of all human feeling?"&lt;ref name=Phipps/&gt;

Muhammad has been described as being very fond of children in general. Watt attributes this to Muhammad's yearning for children, as most of his own children died before him.&lt;ref name=Watt230&gt;Watt (1974), p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; He comforted a child whose pet [[nightingale]] had died.&lt;ref name=Phipps&gt;Phipps, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad played many games with children, joked with them and befriended them.&lt;ref name=Watt230/&gt; Muhammad also showed love to children of other religions. Once he visited his Jewish neighbor's son when the child was sick.&lt;ref name=Yust723&gt;Yust, p.72-3&lt;/ref&gt;

Once, Muhammad was sitting with a child in his lap, and the child urinated over Muhammad. Embarrassed, the father scolded the child. Muhammad restrained the father, and advised him: "This is not a big issue. My clothes can be washed. But be careful with how you treat the child. What can restore his self-esteem after you have dealt with him in public like this?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Kassamali | first=Tahera | title=Raising Children | publisher=Tayyiba Publishers &amp; Distr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Breast-feeding ==

; Pre-Islamic Arabia
In pre-Islamic Arabia, like the Jewish and Christian tradition, sexual relations between males and their [[Milk kinship|milk-mothers]] or milk-sisters are looked upon as incest, also if they were adopted they couldn't [[Breastfeeding|breast feed]].

; Advent of Islam
The Quran [[Mahram|forbade sexual relations]] between [[Rada (fiqh)|males and their milk-mothers]] or [[Sibling#Milk sibling|milk-sisters]].&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|4|23|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Avner Giladi, [[Ayah|verses]] 233 of ''[[sura]]'' 2 (''[[Al-Baqara]]'') and 6 of sura 65 (''[[At-Talaq]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|2|233|style=nosup|expand=no}}, {{cite quran|65|6|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; aim at "protecting repudiated but still lactating women and their nurslings by guaranteeing them economic support from the father for at least two years and by sanctioning non-maternal nursing when needed."{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Orphaned children ==

The Quran in 19 verses forbids harsh and oppressive treatment of orphaned children while urging kindness and justice towards them. Six-year-old [[Muhammad]] himself became an orphan after his mother died in 577, and his father died before he was born. An early Quranic verse&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|93|6–8|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrates [[God in Islam|God's]] providence and care towards him(Surat Ad-Duha). Other Quranic verses identify those who repulse the orphan as unbelievers,&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|107|2|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; rebuke those who do not honor the orphans, and encourage the unbelievers to feed the orphans.&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|89|17|style=nosup|expand=no}}, {{cite quran|90|14–15|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran speaks of the reward waiting for those who feed orphans, poor and the prisoner for the love of God.&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|76|8–9|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also warns those who wrongfully consume the property of orphans that they will be punished in the hereafter with "fire in their own bellies".&lt;ref name="Orphan"&gt;Giladi, Avner. ''Orphans'', [[Encyclopedia of the Quran]]. Brill, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran also gives concrete instructions to guardians ([[Wali (Islamic legal guardian)|Walis]]) regarding the orphans, particularly on how to protect their wealth and property rights.&lt;ref name="Orphan"/&gt;

Islamic scholar [[Muhammad Husayn Tabatabaei]] (1904–1981), renowned for his [[Tafsir|Quranic exegesis]], interprets verses 57 to 59 of sura 16 (''[[An-Nahl]]'')&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|16|57|e=59|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as God admonishing [[Paganism|pagan]] [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] tribes for their [[sexism]], as they believed that Allah had daughters, but "they would choose boys for themselves."

== Rights of children ==

[[File:Young Muslim Couple with Toddler at Masjid al-Haram, 6 April 2015.JPG|thumb|300px|A [[Muslim]] couple and their toddler at [[Masjid al-Haram]], [[Makkah]], [[Saudi Arabia]].]]

* Children have the right to be fed, clothed, and protected until they reach adulthood.&lt;ref name="Arshad"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islam101.com/sociology/parchild.htm|title=Parent-Child Relationship in Islam |accessdate=2015-09-21|author=I. A. Arshed}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Children must have the respect, to enjoy love and affection from their parents.&lt;ref name="Arshad" /&gt;
* Children have the right to be treated equally, vis-a-vis their siblings in terms of financial gifts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Al-Sheha | first = Abdulrahman | title = Women In the Shade of Islam | pages = 33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reported by ''[[Imam Bayhaqi]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Imam Ahmad bin Hanbal said that preferential treatment of a child is permitted if he or she is handicapped while others are not. (In Al-Mughni, vol. 5, p.&amp;nbsp;605, it is stated that special treatment of a child is permissible due to a need, a handicap, blindness, his or her being from a large family, being engaged in studies, or something of the sort, as it is also permitted to withhold from a child who would spend what he is given on sinful or wicked things.)

* The child has the right to be not forced by its step parents or its birth parents.

* Children have the right to education.&lt;ref name="Arshad" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sisters.islamway.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=104 The Rights of Children In Islam]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.themodernreligion.com/index2.html|title=Islam - The Modern Religion: Index Page|first=Fareena|last=Alam|website=www.themodernreligion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Parents are recommended to provide adequately for children in inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-islam.org/divine-perspective-on-rights-a-commentary-of-imam-sajjads-treatise-of-rights/right-n-24-right-child|title=Right n. 24: The Right of the Child|last=|first=|date=25 April 2018|website=Al-Islam.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Hadith says, “It is better for parents to leave their children well provided (financially) than to leave them in poverty”.

Parents demonstrating an unearned preference for one child over the other is considered an act of injustice, as it could lead to an atmosphere of hatred, anger and dismay amongst the children in a household. But if a parent granted one of his children financial help to fulfill a necessity, such as a medical treatment coverage, then such a grant would not be categorized an act of injustice and unfairness. Such a gift will fall under the right to spend in the essential needs of the children, which is a requirement that a parent must fulfill.

* A father is responsible for teaching his children according to Islam as follows:
#Basic information about belief and worship
#Basic information about high moral qualities
#Information on what to be careful about in relations with other people
#Vocational education

Muhammad said: "Every one of you is a protector and guardian and responsible for your wards and things under your care and a man is a guardian of his family members, and is accountable for those placed under his charge." (Bukhari and Muslim)

* Marrying children when they are old enough to get married

One of the rights that children have over their parents is to be provided with marriage when they are old enough, without delaying it. Both the Quran and Muhammed orders{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} that young people and orphans be married when they are old enough.

== Rights of parents ==

* The first and foremost right of the parents is to be obeyed and respected by their children.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.com/cgi-bin/news_service/spot_full_story.asp?service_id=668|title=islamonline.com - This website is for sale! - islamonline Resources and Information |website=www.islamonline.com |deadurl=usurped}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt; A [[hadith]] records that Muhammad defined "the greatest of great sins" as [[polytheism]] and refusing to obey one's parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|3|48|822}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The mother has the right to receive the best treatment than accorded to any other person, in addition the mother has the right of custody of the child in general circumstances, at least until she remarries.&lt;ref name="Mother in Qur'an &amp; Sunnah"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundvision.com/Info/mothers/inquran&amp;hadith.asp|title=Mother in Qur'an &amp; Sunnah|website=soundvision.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onislam.net/english/ask-the-scholar/family/custody/173190.html|title="Child Custody After Mother's Remarriage"|website=onislam.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quote|Narrated [[Abu Hurairah|Abu Huraira]]:

A man came to Allah's Apostle and said, "O Allah's Apostle! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me?" The Prophet said, "Your mother." The man said. "Who is next?" The Prophet said, "Your mother." The man further said, "Who is next?" The Prophet said, "Your mother." The man asked for the fourth time, "Who is next?" The Prophet said, "Your father. "|Muhammad al-Bukhari|''[[Sahih al-Bukhari]]''&lt;ref name="Mother in Qur'an &amp; Sunnah"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* Parents have the right to be looked after by their children, and to receive physical or financial help as necessary, especially in their old age but also parents must not force its children/child as it is sharia.

== Marriage ==
{{Main article|Marriage in Islam}}

===Consent===
All Sunni [[Madh'hab|schools of thought]] agree that [[forced marriage]]s are strictly forbidden in Islam, as [[Marriage in Islam|Islamic marriages]] are [[Islamic marriage contract|contracts between two consenting parties]] referred to as ''[[mithaq]]''.&lt;ref name="USC1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/marriage.html#consent |title=Marriage – The Free Consent of the Parties |accessdate=2007-03-28|author=Prof. Abdur Rahman I. Doi Professor and Director, Center for Islamic Legal Studies, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaira, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A hadith attributed to Muhammad states that a woman cannot be given to a man in marriage without consulting her first, and her consent is obtained either by her agreeing to the marriage or by her remaining silent. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/muslim/16/75 |title=Sahih Muslim » The Book of Marriage » Hadith |accessdate=2018-08-13|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Muhammad gave women the power to annul their marriages if it was found that they had been married against their consent.
{{Quote|"When a man gives his daughter in marriage and she dislikes it, the marriage shall be annulled." Once a virgin girl came to the Prophet and said that her father had married her to a man against her wishes. The Prophet gave her the right to repudiate the marriage.&lt;ref name=USC1/&gt;}}

In Islam, marriage is essentially a contract. However, the distinction between sacred and secular was never explicit in Islam, so it is not only a secular contract.

For a valid marriage, the following conditions must be satisfied, according to the major Islamic schools of jurisprudence:&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.witness-pioneer.org/vil/Books/SH_SL/islamic_law_regarding_marriage.htm|title="Hannan, Social Laws in Islam"|website=witness-pioneer.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There must be a clear proposal.&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;
* There must be a clear acceptance, but silence is taken as acceptance as well.&lt;ref name="USC1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|7|62|67|e=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* There must be at least two competent witnesses. This is necessary to exclude illicit sex and to safeguard legitimacy of progeny. It is recommended that marriage should be widely publicized.&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;
* There must be a marriage gift, little or more, by the bridegroom to the bride.&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt;

The [[Maliki]] school of thought gives the right of ''ijbar'' to the guardian. ''Ijbar'' is defined as the annulment of marriage due to objection by male guardian.&lt;ref name="USC2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/dept/MSA/humanrelations/womeninislam/marriage.html#safety | title=Marriage – Ijbar: A Safety Valve |accessdate=2007-03-28|author=Prof. Abdur Rahman I. Doi Professor and Director, Center for Islamic Legal Studies, Ahmadu Bello University, Zaira, Nigeria}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Malik ibn Anas]], children due to their immaturity may choose an unsuitable partner for themselves, hence, the power of ''ijbar'' has been given to the guardian so that he may overrule the child to marry someone he thinks is unsuitable for her. This is the legal right given to the guardian for girls by Maliki school of thought.&lt;ref name="USC2"/&gt; In addition, Islam requires that parents be followed in almost every circumstances, hence parents may ask their children to divorce a certain person, but this cannot be upheld in an Islamic court of law and is not a legal right of the parent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Hadith-usc|bukhari|usc=yes|8|73|7|e=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age of marriage===
{{See also|Aisha#Age at marriage|Criticism of Muhammad#Aisha}}
No age limits have been fixed by Islam for marriage according to [[Reuben Levy]],&lt;ref name="Levy, p.106"&gt;Levy, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; and "quite young children may be legally married". The girl may not live with the husband however until she is fit for marital sexual relations.&lt;ref name="Levy, p.106"/&gt; The [[Hanafi]] madhhab of Islamic ''[[fiqh]]'' maintains that a wife must not be taken to her husband's house until she reaches the condition of fitness for sexual relations. Levy adds:
{{Quote|"In case of a dispute on the matter between the husband and the bride's [[wali]] (her nearest male kinsman and her guardian), the judge ([[qadi]]) is to be informed and he is to appoint two matrons to examine the girl and report on her physical preparedness for marriage. If they decide she is too young, she must return to her father's house until she is judged fit. Betrothal may take place at any age. Actual marriage is later, but the age for it varies in different lands."|Reuben Levy|''The Social Structure of Islam''&lt;ref&gt;Levy, p.107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Islamic legal terminology, ''[[Baligh]]'' refers to a person who has reached maturity, [[puberty]] or adulthood and has full responsibility under [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Legal theorists assign different ages and criteria for reaching this state for both males and females.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito]], Islam, [[Oxford University]] Press 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In marriage ''baligh'' is related to the Arabic legal expression, ''hatta tutiqa'l-rijal'', which means that the wedding may not take place until the girl is physically fit to engage in [[sexual intercourse]]. Some Hanafi scholars hold the opinion that sexual intercourse may take place before puberty, as long as it's not injurious to one's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askimam.org/public/question_detail/16567|title=Public » Askimam|website=www.askimam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, ''baligh'' or ''balaghat'' concerns the reaching of [[sexual maturity]] which becomes manifest by the [[Menstrual cycle|menses]]. The age related to these two concepts can, but need not necessarily, coincide. Only after a separate condition called ''rushd'', or intellectual maturity to handle one's own property, is reached can a girl receive her [[Bride price|bridewealth]].&lt;ref&gt;Masud, ''Islamic Legal Interpretation, Muftis and Their Fatwas'', [[Harvard University]] Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adoption and fostering ==
{{Main article|Islamic adoptional jurisprudence}}

Islam highly recommends the "fostering" of children, defined as "assuming partial or complete responsibility of a child in lieu of the biological parents". However, Islam forbids naming the child as one's own, or creating any "fictive relationships". Islamic adoption is sometimes called "fostering" or "partial adoption" and is similar to "[[open adoption]]".&lt;ref name="ingrid"&gt;Ingrid Matison, "Adoption and Fostering", ''Encyclopedia of Women &amp; Islamic Cultures''&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally Islam has viewed legal adoption as a source of potential problems, such as accidentally marrying one's sibling or when distributing inheritance.&lt;ref name="saqir"&gt;A. Giladi, ''saqir'', [[Encyclopedia of Islam]], Brill&lt;/ref&gt;

If a child is adopted he or she does not become a son or daughter, but rather a [[Ward (law)|ward]] of the adopting caretaker(s). The child’s family name is not changed to that of the adopting parent(s) and his or her [[Legal guardian|guardians]] are publicly known as such. Legally, this is close to other nations' systems for [[foster care]]. Other common rules governing [[Islamic adoptional jurisprudence|adoption in Islamic culture]] address inheritance, marriage regulations, and the fact that adoptive parents are considered trustees of another individual's child rather than the child's new parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islam.about.com/cs/parenting/a/adoption.htm|title=What Islam Teaches About Adoption|website=about.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually an adopted child inherits from his or her biological parents, not automatically from the adoptive parents. If the child is below the age of consent at the time of inheritance (from the biological family), his or her adoptive parents serve as trustees over the child's wealth, but may not intermingle with it.

Adoption was a common practice in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]]. According to this custom, the adopted son would take the name of his adoptive parent, and would be assimilated into the family in a "legal sense".{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Islam viewed this practice as "erasure of natal identity". This practice was sometimes done for emotional reasons, such as pity, but adoption was also a means through which [[slave]]s were stripped of their identities and given the name of their slavemaster.&lt;ref name="ingrid"/&gt; The Quran replaced the pre-Islamic custom of adoption by the recommendation that "believers treat children of unknown origin as their brothers in the faith".&lt;ref name="saqir"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{cite quran|33|4|end=5|style=nosup|expand=no}}, {{cite quran|33|37|end=40|style=nosup|expand=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From verses 4 and 5 in sura 33 (''[[Al-Ahzab]]'') in the Quran, Allah instructed adoptive parents to refer to their adoptive children by the names of their biological parents, if known:

{{Quote|...nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. Such is (only) your (manner of) speech by your mouths. But Allah tells (you) the Truth, and He shows the (right) Way.

Call them by (the names of) their fathers: that is juster in the sight of Allah. But if ye know not their father's (names, call them) your Brothers in faith, or your maulas. But there is no blame on you if ye make a mistake therein: (what counts is) the intention of your hearts: and Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful. |Quran&lt;ref&gt;Quran {{Quran-usc|33|4|e=5|s=ns|expand=n}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3885">[[Image:La justice de Trajan.jpg|thumb|200px|''The Justice of Trajan'' by [[Eugène Delacroix]], 1840.]] 
The '''Justice of Trajan''' is a legendary episode in the life of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Trajan]], based upon [[Dio Cassius]]' account (Epitome of Book LXVIII, chapter 10): "He did not, however, as might have been expected of a warlike man, pay any less attention to the civil administration nor did he dispense justice any the less; on the contrary, he conducted trials, now in the Forum of Augustus, now in the Portico of Livia, as it was called, and often elsewhere on a tribunal."

According to the story, Trajan, busy with preparations for the [[Trajan's Dacian Wars|Dacian Wars]], was petitioned for justice by the mother of a murdered man. He asked her to wait until he returned, but she pointed out that he might not return at all. He made time to settle her case despite all the other calls on his time. The legend, though indirectly, was popularized by [[Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'', alluded to in the Paradise, and recounted in Purgatory, X, 73-94:

{{cquote|The wretch appear'd amid all these to say:&lt;br&gt;
"Grant vengeance, sire! for, woe beshrew this heart&lt;br&gt;
My son is murder'd." He replying seem'd;&lt;br&gt;
"Wait now till I return." And she, as one&lt;br&gt;
Made hasty by her grief; "O sire, if thou&lt;br&gt;
Dost not return?"—"Where I am, who then is,&lt;br&gt;
May right thee."—"What to thee is other's good,&lt;br&gt;
If thou neglect thy own?"—"Now comfort thee,"&lt;br&gt;
At length he answers. "It beseemeth well&lt;br&gt;
My duty be perform'd, ere I move hence:&lt;br&gt;
So justice wills; and pity bids me stay.}}

The origin of the legend and its vicissitudes since antiquity have been the subject of several studies, including the detailed "Leggende" by G. Boni, published in 1906. The episode was reflected in several works of art and in the verse ''The Justice'' by Belarusian poet [[Simeon of Polotsk]] (1629—1680). Among artists that depicted the legend are [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Rogier van der Weyden]], [[Hans Sebald Beham]], [[Noël Coypel]] and [[Noël Hallé]]. A French painter [[Raoul Dufy]] was inspired by Delacroix's painting of the justice.

Historically, ''the justice of Trajan'' may also refer either to what was described by [[Pliny the Younger]] (''Epistulae'', VI, 31, a court trial in [[Centumcellae]]) or depicted on [[Trajan's Column]], where Trajan judges the captured barbarian chiefs, or to a lost painting by [[Rogier van der Weyden]]. (The city of Brussels commissioned Van der Weyden to paint four large panel paintings for the [[Brussels Town Hall]] illustrating the 'Justice of Trajan' and the '[[Justice of Herkenbald]]'; they were destroyed when the [[Bombardment of Brussels|French bombarded the city in 1695]]).&lt;ref&gt;Dirk de Vos, 1999, ''Rogier van der Weyden'', pp. 345-355&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lithium toxicity''', also known as '''lithium overdose''' and '''lithium poisoning''', is the condition of having too much lithium in the blood. This condition also happens in persons that are taking lithium in which the lithium levels are affected by [[Drug interaction|drug interactions]] in the body.

The toxicity falls into 3 categories: [[Acute (medicine)|acute]], [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]], and acute on chronic. Acute toxicity is a single ingestion, without prior exposure to lithium. This includes events such as a child who unintentionally ingests the drug or intentional self-harm ingestion, without previous exposure to the drug. Chronic toxicity occurs in people who accumulate high levels during ongoing therapy. Acute on chronic occurs in persons in ongoing therapy with an acute ingestion of excessive amounts either accidentally or intentionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hedya|first=Shireen A.|title=Lithium Toxicity|date=2018|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499992/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29763168|access-date=2018-10-30|last2=Swoboda|first2=Henry D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
When lithium overdoses produce neurological deficits or cardiac toxicity, the symptoms are considered serious and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, J. B., Klaassen, C. D., &amp; Casarett, L. J. (2010). ''Casarett &amp; Doulls essentials of toxicology''. Place of publication not identified: McGraw Hill Medical.&lt;/ref&gt; The severity of the symptoms is graded with lithium concentration on the range of mild, moderate, and severe. The normal serum lithium concentration should be between 0.6-1. Mild intoxication is defined as lithium concentration between 1.5-2.5 mEq/L. Moderate intoxication is serum lithium concentration between 2.5-3.5 mEq/L. Severe intoxication occurs with serum lithium concentration greater than 3.5 mEq/L. Severe intoxication presents with [[coma]], [[hyperthermia]], and [[hypotension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hedya|first=Shireen A.|title=Lithium Toxicity|date=2018|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK499992/|work=StatPearls|publisher=StatPearls Publishing|pmid=29763168|access-date=2018-10-30|last2=Swoboda|first2=Henry D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acute toxicity ===
In acute toxicity, people have primarily gastrointestinal symptoms such as [[vomiting]] and [[diarrhea]], which may result in [[Hypovolemia|volume depletion]]. During acute toxicity, lithium distributes later into the central nervous system causing dizziness and other mild neurological symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gitlin|first=Michael|date=2016-12-17|title=Lithium side effects and toxicity: prevalence and management strategies|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5164879/|journal=International Journal of Bipolar Disorders|volume=4|issue=1|pages=27|doi=10.1186/s40345-016-0068-y|issn=2194-7511|pmc=5164879|pmid=27900734}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chronic toxicity ===
In chronic toxicity, people have primarily neurological symptoms which include include [[nystagmus]], [[tremor]], [[hyperreflexia]], [[ataxia]], and [[Delirium|change in mental status]]. During chronic toxicity, the gastrointestinal symptoms seen in acute toxicity are less prominent. The symptoms are often vague and nonspecific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Netto|first=Ivan|last2=Phutane|first2=Vivek H.|date=2012|title=Reversible Lithium Neurotoxicity: Review of the Literature|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3357580/|journal=The Primary Care Companion for CNS Disorders|volume=14|issue=1|doi=10.4088/PCC.11r01197|issn=2155-7772|pmc=3357580|pmid=22690368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Acute on chronic toxicity ===
In acute on chronic toxicity, people have symptoms of both acute and chronic toxicity.

==Pathophysiology==
Lithium is readily absorbed from the [[gastrointestinal tract]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, J. B., Klaassen, C. D., &amp; Casarett, L. J. (2010). ''Casarett &amp; Doulls essentials of toxicology''. Place of publication not identified: McGraw Hill Medical.&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed to the body with higher levels in the kidney, [[thyroid]], and bone as compared to other tissues. Since lithium is almost exclusively excreted by the [[Kidney|kidneys]], people with preexisting [[Chronic kidney disease|renal insufficiency]] are at high risk of developing lithium intoxication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haussmann|first=R.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=von Bonin|first3=S.|last4=Grof|first4=P.|last5=Lewitzka|first5=U.|date=2015-10-22|title=Treatment of lithium intoxication: facing the need for evidence|journal=International Journal of Bipolar Disorders|language=En|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1186/s40345-015-0040-2|issn=2194-7511|pmc=4615994|pmid=26493348}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium toxicity can be mistaken for other syndromes associated with antipsychotic use, such as [[serotonin syndrome]] because lithium increases [[serotonin]] metabolites in the [[cerebrospinal fluid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shahani|first=Lokesh|title=Venlafaxine Augmentation With Lithium Leading to Serotonin Syndrome|journal=The Journal of Neuropsychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences|language=en|volume=24|issue=3|pages=E47|doi=10.1176/appi.neuropsych.11080196|pmid=23037683|issn=0895-0172|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several drug interactions with lithium. Interactions can occur from [[Typical antipsychotic|typical antipsychotics]] or [[Atypical antipsychotic|atypical antipsyhcotics]]. In particular, certain drugs enhance lithium levels by increasing renal re-absorption at the proximal tubule. These drugs are [[ACE inhibitor|angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors]], [[Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug|non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs]] and [[Thiazide|thiazide diuretics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haussmann|first=R.|last2=Bauer|first2=M.|last3=von Bonin|first3=S.|last4=Grof|first4=P.|last5=Lewitzka|first5=U.|date=2015-10-22|title=Treatment of lithium intoxication: facing the need for evidence|journal=International Journal of Bipolar Disorders|language=En|volume=3|issue=1|pages=23|doi=10.1186/s40345-015-0040-2|issn=2194-7511|pmc=4615994|pmid=26493348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
When lithium toxicity is suspected are, the common laboratory tests are:  

*[[Blood glucose monitoring|fingerstick glucose]]
* serum lithium concentration 
*[[basic metabolic panel]] to assess renal function
* serum [[acetaminophen]] and [[Salicylic acid|salicylate]] concentrations to rule out other sources of acute ingestion
*[[Pregnancy test|urine pregnancy tests]] to ensure management does not cause [[abortion]]

Imaging tests are not helpful. 

== Treatment ==
If the person's lithium toxicity is mild or moderate, lithium dosage is reduced or stopped entirely. If the toxicity is severe, lithium may need to be removed from your body. The removal of lithium is done in a [[hospital]] [[emergency department]]. It may involve:

*[[Gastric lavage]]. A tube is placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. The tube is used to remove lithium that has not been digested yet. It may also be used to put medicines directly into the stomach to help stop lithium from being absorbed.
* Medicines that increase removal of lithium by the kidneys.
*[[Hemodialysis|Use of an artificial kidney to clean the blood]] (''dialysis''). This is usually done only in the most severe cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waring|first=W.

==Introduction==

[[Madagascar]]'s first and only [[biodiversity]] research center, the '''Bibikely Biodiversity  Center''' is a joint project of the [[Bibikely Biodiversity Institute]], and the [[California Academy of Sciences]], in cooperation with the Malagasy government.

The Bibikely Biodiversity Institute is an [[NGO]] founded and presently directed by Dr. [[Brian Fisher (biologist)|Brian Fisher]], preeminent field [[biologist]], and the curator and chairman of the [[entomology]] department of the California Academy of Sciences.

The Center began operations in rented facilities in 1996 and moved into its permanent facility in late 2004, which is leased at no cost from the Malagasy government until 2055.

Located within the Tsimbazaza National Zoological Day-night park in Madagascar's capital city, [[Antananarivo]], the new facility is adjacent to the Malagasy Academy of Sciences, the Academy Library, and the Academy Herbarium.

==Goals==
===Conservation===
The center was conceived in 2001 as a means to provide a safe and permanent home for the Bibikely Biodiversity Institute to continue its work of cataloging and understanding the rich biological endowment that is Madagascar's biodiversity.

Center’s research will help to identify and protect more than three times the currently protected land in Madagascar.

===Understanding===
The Center will enable the Bibikely Biodiversity Institute to expand its work in understanding the ecosystems of Madagascar, particularly as they relate to arthropods.

===Education===
The Center will provide the facilities required to train a larger number of students, particularly those from Madagascar itself, in the science and practice of systematics, ecology, conservation and entomology.

===Collection===
The Center will also provide space to house the Malagasy government's National Arthropod Collection, a repository of thousands of specimens of arthropods collected on Madagascar.  The collection makes possible a large part of the needed research on arthropods of Madagascar.

==Funding==

The Center is in grave need of further funding in order to complete its construction and to begin outfitting it with the equipment needed for its research and education missions.

Individuals and organizations interested in contributing should contact the fundraising coordinator.

However, this degree program concentrates heavily on leader-follower interactions, cross-cultural communications, coaching, influencing, team development, leading organizational changes, strategic thinking,  [[project leader]]ship, and behavioral motivation theories. It does not concentrate on financial or quantitative analysis, [[marketing]], or [[accounting]] which are common in MBA programs. The degree program is appealing to businesspeople in well-established careers already. The MSL degree is similar to the [[Master of Science in Organizational Leadership]] (MSOL) degree or the Master of Leadership Sciences degree offered by the [[National School of Leadership]] in India.

[[Image:MPI aussen.jpg|thumb|400px|alt=Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law| Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition (formerly known as the Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law)]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für Innovation und Wettbewerb}})  is a [[Munich]], [[Germany]], based research institute, which is part of the [[Max Planck Society|Max Planck Society for the Advancement of Science]], which manages more than 90 institutes and research institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law website, [http://www.intellecprop.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/organization/summary/mpg.cfm ''Max Planck Society, Organization''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120905233929/http://www.intellecprop.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/organization/summary/mpg.cfm |date=2012-09-05 }}. Consulted on January 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The institute was formerly known as ''Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law'' and the name was changed to ''Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition'' in view of the broader focus of the institute and its interdisciplinary character. The major research areas of the institute are intellectual property, innovation and competition.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.ip.mpg.de/en/about_us.html&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from providing research support for scholars from across the world, the institute also publishes the ''[[International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law]]'' (IIC). 

As of 2015, Prof. [[Dietmar Harhoff]] is the Managing Director of the Institute. Prof. [[Reto M. Hilty]] and Prof. [[Josef Drexl]], are Directors of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.ip.mpg.de/en/academic_body/directors.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
In 1952, a new school of law “The Institute for Foreign and International Patent, Trademark, and Copyright Law” was founded at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University]] of Munich. Under the leadership of its first Director [[Eduard Reimer]] (1896–1957), President of the [[German Patent Office]], the Institute quickly gained international importance and recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law website, [http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm ''Academic History of the Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205204249/http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm |date=2007-02-05 }}. Consulted on January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His successor [[Eugen Ulmer]] (1903–1988) put a stamp on the research work for decades; he notably promoted the expansion of the national and international copyright and competition law. In 1966, as its founding Director, he established the “Max-Planck Institute for Foreign and International Patent, Copyright and Competition Law”.

Alongside Eugen Ulmer, [[Friedrich-Karl Beier]] (1926–1997) and Gerhard Schricker (until 2003) were admitted to the Directorate of the Max Planck Institute. In the following decades, the Max Planck Institute would exert a wide-ranging influence on the national and international development of the relevant fields of law. An outstanding example of this influence was research based on [[comparative law]] analyses regarding European harmonisation of the law against unfair competition of [[trademark law]], of [[design law]] as well as [[copyright law]]. Also essential were comparative law studies on the patentability of biotechnological inventions or the exploration of limits between the trademark rights.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

In 2002, the Institute was modernised significantly, in particular with respect to personnel, areas of expertise, and its facilities. On 1 January 2002, Josef Drexl, Reto M. Hilty and [[Wolfgang Schön]] were appointed to the Directorate of the Max Planck Institute, serving alongside [[Joseph Straus]], who was appointed Director in 2001 taking over the directorship from Gerhard Schricker. On 1 July 2002, a new department “Accounting and Taxes” was added to the newly formed unit “Intellectual Property Law and Competition Law”. This department was conceived to cover law regarding capital market information and the taxation of companies as constituents of the international economic and competition regime.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

Also in 2002, the [[Munich Intellectual Property Law Center]] (MIPLC) was founded, which from an administrative point of view is managed as an independent department of the Institute, but is supported by the [[Max Planck Society]] in cooperation with the [[University of Augsburg]], the [[Technical University Munich]] as well as the [[George Washington Law School]], Washington D.C. The MIPLC conducts both research as well as teaching and, since autumn 2003, offers an internationally networked LLM degree, under the direction of Joseph Straus (until 2008) and Josef Drexl (as of 2009) and staffed by world-renowned academics.&lt;ref&gt;Max Planck Institute for Intellectual Property and Competition Law website, [http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm ''Academic History of the Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205204249/http://www.ip.mpg.de/ww/en/pub/research/researchprofile/wissenschaftliche_geschichte.cfm |date=2007-02-05 }}. Consulted on January 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis is on IP law and courses are held in English. Students come from many countries of all five continents.

In 2009 [[Kai A. Konrad]] was appointed to the Directorate of the Institute and the Department of Public Economics was added to the formed unit "Intellectual Property, Competition and Tax Law". The main field of Public Economics studies the functioning of government, as well as the challenges and the opportunities for reform. The Department analyzes the limits and scope of government, with a special focus on levying taxes to finance its core tasks in a modern nation state.{{cn|date=September 2015}}

'''''Meow the Jewels''''' is a [[remix album]] by American [[hip hop music|hip hop]] duo [[Run the Jewels]]. It was released on September 25, 2015, by [[Mass Appeal Records]]. The album, a remix of the duo's original album ''[[Run the Jewels 2]]'', has all instrumentals replaced with sounds of cats.

==Release and promotion==
Run the Jewels, as part of the original album release, offered a series of absurd "deluxe releases" for large sums of money, parodying indulgent "stretch goals" offered on [[crowdfunding]] campaigns on [[Kickstarter]].&lt;ref name="Check Out The Ridiculous Run The Jewels 2 Deluxe Packages"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1705327/check-out-the-ridiculous-run-the-jewels-2-deluxe-packages/news/|title=Check Out The Ridiculous Run The Jewels 2 Deluxe Packages|work=Stereogum|date=September 15, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2016|last=Breihan|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the less expensive of these was the group creating a remix album using cat sounds; a group of fans launched an online campaign to raise the money to pay the group the requested $40,000 to do this.&lt;ref name="Run The Jewels Might Make A Version Of Their Album With Nothing But Cat Noises"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1705760/run-the-jewels-might-make-a-version-of-their-album-with-nothing-but-cat-noises/news/|title=Run The Jewels Might Make A Version of Their Album With Nothing But Cat Noises|work=Stereogum|date=September 16, 2014|accessdate=April 27, 2016|last=Breihan|first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Meow the Jewels"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1957344648/meow-the-jewels|title=Meow the Jewels|publisher=[[Kickstarter]]|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign in fact raised over $60,000, which Run the Jewels announced that the duo would be donating to charity.&lt;ref name="Meow the Jewels"/&gt; Several other record producers announced that they would be contributing to the remixes, including [[Just Blaze]], [[Prince Paul (producer)|Prince Paul]], [[The Alchemist (musician)|The Alchemist]], [[Geoff Barrow]], [[Dan the Automator]] and [[Boots (musician)|Boots]], among others.&lt;ref name="Meow The Jewels Is Happening"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stereogum.com/1711919/meow-the-jewels-is-happening/news/|title=Meow The Jewels Is Happening|last=Breihan|first=Tom|date=October 15, 2014|work=Stereogum|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album was released for free on September 25, 2015, while the pre-order for the limited-edition [[Phonograph record|2xLP]] was made available on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pitchfork.com/news/58210-run-the-jewels-drop-meow-the-jewels/|title=Run the Jewels Drop Meow the Jewels|work=Pitchfork|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=September 26, 2015|last=Camp|first=Zoe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Meow the Jewels'' received generally positive reviews from critics.

The '''Mesoamerican Long Count calendar''' is a non-repeating, [[vigesimal]] (base-20) and base-18 calendar used by several [[pre-Columbian]] [[Mesoamerica]]n cultures, most notably the [[Maya civilization|Maya]]. For this reason, it is often known as the '''Maya''' (or '''Mayan''') '''Long Count calendar'''. Using a modified vigesimal tally, the Long Count calendar identifies a day by counting the number of days passed since a [[Mesoamerican creation myths|mythical creation date]] that corresponds to August 11, 3114 [[Common Era|BCE]] in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref group=n&gt;The correlation between the Long Count and Western calendars is calculated according to the one used by a majority of Maya researchers, known as the (modified) GMT or Goodman-Martinez-Thompson correlation. An alternate correlation sometimes used puts the starting date two days later. August 11, 3114&amp;nbsp;BCE is a date in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]], which is to September 6, -3113 [[Julian calendar|Julian]] [[astronomical year numbering|astronomical]]. See [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar#Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count|Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count calendar section]] elsewhere in this article for details on correlations.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Long Count calendar was widely used on monuments.

==Background==
The two most widely used calendars in pre-Columbian Mesoamerica, were the 260-day [[Tzolk'in]] and the 365 day [[Haab']]. The equivalent Aztec calendars are known in [[Nahuatl]] as the [[tonalpohualli]] and [[Xiuhpohualli]].

The combination of a Haab' and a Tzolk'in date identifies a day in a combination which does not occur again for 18,980 days (52 Haab' cycles of 365 days times 73 Tzolk'in cycles of 260 days, approximately 52 years), a period known as the [[Calendar Round]]. To identify days over periods longer than this, Mesoamericans used the Long Count calendar.

==Long Count periods==

[[File:La Mojarra Estela 1 (Escritura superior).jpg|thumb|266x266px|Detail showing columns of glyphs from a portion of the 2nd century CE [[La Mojarra Stela 1]]. The left column gives a Long Count date of 8.5.16.9.7, or 156 CE. The others columns visible are glyphs from the [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]
The Long Count calendar identifies a date by counting the number of days from a starting date that is generally calculated to be August 11, 3114&amp;nbsp;BCE in the proleptic Gregorian calendar or September 6 in the Julian calendar (or −3113 in astronomical year numbering). There has been much debate over the precise correlation between the Western calendars and the Long Count calendars. The August 11 date is based on the GMT correlation (see [[Mesoamerican Long Count calendar#Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count|Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count calendar section]] elsewhere in this article for details on correlations).

The completion of 13 [[Baktun|b'ak'tuns]] (August 11, 3114&amp;nbsp;BCE) marks the Creation of the world of human beings according to the Maya. On this day, Raised-up-Sky-Lord caused three stones to be set by associated gods at Lying-Down-Sky, First-Three-Stone-Place. Because the sky still lay on the primordial sea, it was black. The setting of the three stones centered the cosmos which allowed the sky to be raised, revealing the {{nowrap|sun.&lt;ref&gt;Freidel, Schele &amp; Parker (1993, pp. 59–75).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rather than using a base-10 scheme, like Western numbering, the Long Count days were tallied in a modified base-20 scheme. In a pure base-20 scheme, 0.0.0.1.5 is equal to 25 and 0.0.0.2.0 is equal to 40. The Long Count is not pure base-20, however, since the second digit from the right (and only that digit) rolls over to zero when it reaches 18.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} Thus 0.0.1.0.0 does not represent 400 days, but rather only 360 days and 0.0.0.17.19 represents 359 days.

The name ''b'ak'tun'' was invented by modern scholars. The numbered Long Count was no longer in use by the time the Spanish arrived in the [[Yucatán Peninsula]], although unnumbered [[k'atun]]s and tuns were still in use. Instead the Maya were using an abbreviated [[Maya calendar#Short Count|Short Count]].

==Mesoamerican numerals==
[[File:maya.svg|thumb|Maya numerals]]
Long Count dates are written with Mesoamerican numerals, as shown on this table. A dot represents ''1'' while a bar equals ''5''. The shell glyph was used to represent the zero concept. The Long Count calendar required the use of zero as a place-holder and presents one of the earliest uses of the [[0 (number)#History|zero concept in history]].

On Maya monuments, the Long Count syntax is more complex. The date sequence is given once, at the beginning of the inscription and opens with the so-called ISIG (Introductory Series Initial Glyph) which reads ''tzik-a(h) hab’ [patron of Haab' month]'' ("revered was the year-count with the patron [of the month]").&lt;ref&gt;Boot, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;  Next come the 5 digits of the Long Count, followed by the Calendar Round (tzolk'in and Haab') and [[Maya calendar#Supplementary Series|supplementary series]]. The supplementary series is optional and contains lunar data, for example, the age of the moon on the day and the calculated length of current lunation.&lt;ref group=n&gt;Notable in this sequence is the glyph with nine variant forms labeled G by early epigraphers. It has been connected with the cycle of Lords of the Night known from colonial era sources in Central Mexico but alternate explanations have also been offered. See Thompson.&lt;/ref&gt; The text then continues with whatever activity occurred on that date.

A drawing of a full Maya Long Count inscription is shown [[#Calculating a full Long Count date|below]].

==Earliest Long Counts==
The earliest contemporaneous Long Count inscription yet discovered is on Stela 2 at [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]], [[Chiapas]], Mexico, showing a date of 36&amp;nbsp;BCE, although Stela 2 from [[Takalik Abaj]], [[Guatemala]] might be earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Graham (1992, p. 331, see Fig. 5 for a line drawing of the monument)&lt;/ref&gt; [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Abaj_Takalik_Stela2.jpg] Takalik Abaj Stela 2's highly battered Long Count inscription shows 7 ''bak'tuns'', followed by ''k'atuns'' with a tentative 6 coefficient, but that could also be 11 or 16, giving the range of possible dates to fall between 236 and 19&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref group=n&gt;To clarify, there are Long Count inscriptions which refer to dates earlier than the 1st century BCE, but these were carved much later in a retrospective fashion.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|reason=Some sources identify just Baktun 7, though Katun 6–16 is at least consistent with Mora-Marín (2005)'s 236–19&amp;nbsp;BCE|date=February 2014}}  

Although Takalik Abaj Stela 2 remains controversial, this table includes it, as well as six other artifacts with the eight oldest Long Count inscriptions according to Dartmouth professor Vincent H. Malmström (two of the artifacts contain two dates and Malmström does not include Takalik Abaj Stela 2).&lt;ref name=malmstrom1997&gt;{{ cite book | first=Vincent Herschel | last=Malmström | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~izapa/CS-MM-Chap.%206.htm | title=Cycles of the Sun, Mysteries of the Moon | chapter=Chapter 6 | date=1997 | publisher=[[University of Texas Press]] | isbn=978-0-292-75197-2 }} Note: Malmström's Gregorian dates are three or four days later than a correlation of 584283 would give (the Wikipedia table has been corrected).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Vincent H. Mahlstrom | work=Department of Geography, Faculty &amp; Staff | publisher=[[Dartmouth College]] | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~geog/facstaff/mahlstrom.html | accessdate=2014-02-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interpretations of inscriptions on some artifacts differ.&lt;ref name=malmstrom1997/&gt;&lt;ref name=marcus1976/&gt;&lt;ref name=riese1988/&gt;

Of the six sites, three are on the western edge of the Maya homeland and three are several hundred kilometers further west, leading some researchers to believe that the Long Count calendar predates the Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl (2004, p. 186).&lt;/ref&gt; La Mojarra Stela 1, the Tuxtla Statuette, Tres Zapotes Stela C and Chiapa Stela 2 are all inscribed in an [[Epi-Olmec script|Epi-Olmec]], not Maya, style.&lt;ref&gt;"A sketch of prior documentation of epi-Olmec texts", Section 5 in Peréz de Lara &amp; Justeson (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  El Baúl Stela 2, on the other hand, was created in the [[Izapa]]n style.

The first unequivocally Maya artifact is Stela 29 from [[Tikal]], with the Long Count date of 292 CE (8.12.14.8.15), more than 300 years after Stela 2 from Chiapa de Corzo.&lt;ref&gt;Coe &amp; Koontz (2002, p. 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, with the discovery in Guatemala of the [[San Bartolo (Maya site)]] stone block text (c.a. 300&amp;nbsp;BCE),&lt;ref&gt;Saturno et al. 2006&lt;/ref&gt; it has been argued that this text celebrates an upcoming time period ending celebration. This time period may have been projected to end sometime between 7.3.0.0.0 and 7.5.0.0.0 — 295 and 256&amp;nbsp;BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Giron-Abrego 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Besides this being the earliest Maya hieroglyphic text so far uncovered, it would arguably be the earliest glyphic evidence to date of Long Count notation in Mesoamerica.

==Correlations between Western calendars and the Long Count==
[[File:Estela C de Tres Zapotes.jpg|thumb|250px||The back of Stela C from [[Tres Zapotes]], an Olmec archaeological site.&lt;br&gt;This is the second oldest Long Count date yet discovered. The numerals 7.16.6.16.18 translate to September 1, 32&amp;nbsp;BCE (Gregorian). The glyphs surrounding the date are what is thought to be one of the few surviving examples of [[Epi-Olmec script]].]]

The Maya and Western calendars are correlated by using a [[Julian day number]] (JDN) of the starting date of the current creation — 13.0.0.0.0, 4 [[Ajaw]], 8 Kumk'u.&lt;ref group=n&gt;All extant Maya inscriptions that represent this base date wrote it with a "13" bak'tuns, not "0". But when using "13.0.0.0.0" as a base date in calculations, the "13" bak'tuns has the numerical value 0, as if it were written as "''0''.0.0.0.0". This is easily confused when the "13" bak'tuns has the actual value 13 in the ''current'' bakt'un, as in the Maya date for today: {{Maya date}} (={{CURRENTDATE}}).&lt;/ref&gt; This is referred to as a correlation constant. The generally accepted correlation constant is the Modified Thompson 2, "[[Joseph T. Goodman|Goodman]]–Martinez–[[J. Eric S. Thompson|Thompson]]", or GMT correlation of 584,283 days. Using the GMT correlation, the current creation started on September 6, −3113 ([[Julian calendar|Julian]] astronomical) – August 11, 3114 BCE in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]]. The study of correlating the Maya and western calendar is referred to as the correlation question.&lt;ref name="mesoweb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/publications/CAA_14/Thompson1935.pdf |title= Maya chronology: The correlation question by J.

In ''Breaking the Maya Code'', [[Michael D. Coe]] writes: "In spite of oceans of ink that have been spilled on the subject, there now is not the slightest chance that these three scholars (conflated to GMT when talking about the correlation) were not right...".&lt;ref&gt;''Breaking the Maya Code'', 1992, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  The evidence for the GMT correlation is historical, astronomical and archaeological:

'''Historical''': Calendar Round dates with a corresponding [[Julian calendar|Julian date]] are recorded in [[Diego de Landa]]'s ''[[Relación de las cosas de Yucatán]]'' (written circa 1566), the Chronicle of Oxcutzkab and the books of [[Chilam Balam]]. De Landa records a date that is a Tun ending in the [[Maya calendar#Short Count|Short Count]]. Oxkutzcab contains 12 Tun endings. Bricker and Bricker find that only the GMT correlation in consistent with these dates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bricker |first1=Harvey M. |last2=Bricker |first2=Victoria Reifler |date=August 1, 2011 |title=Astronomy in the Maya Codices |series=Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society |publisher=American Philosophical Society |page=85 |isbn=978-0871692658 |quote=if the 12 tun endings in the Chronicle of Oxkutzcab are accepted as referring to the 12 consecutive years and if the calendar-round dates (except that containing the month of Ceh) are correct when translated to a common calendar, the “11.16” correlation is the only possible one.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel&lt;ref&gt;The Book of Chilam Balam of Chumayel Ralph L. Roys, Washington D.C.; Carnegie Institution 1933, pp. 79, 83&lt;/ref&gt; contains the only colonial reference to classic long-count dates. The Julian calendar date of 11.16.0.0.0 confirms the GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edmonson |first1=Munro S. |date=December 1976 |title=The Mayan Calendar Reform of 11.16.0.0.0 |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=17 |issue= 4 |pages=713–17 |jstor=2741269 |doi=10.1086/201806}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Annals of the Cakchiquels]] contains numerous Tzolk'in dates correlated with European dates. These confirm the GMT correlation.{{sfn|Recinos and Goetz|p=33 Recinos gives 2 Tihax (Etz'nab') is September 10, 1541([[Julian calendar|Julian]]). The date which marked the destruction of the city of Guatemala founded at the foot of the Volcano of Agua. "After a period of heavy rain there was an earthquake and then a flood of water (a [[lahar]]) that destroyed the old city of Guatemala"}} Weeks, Sachse and Prager transcribed three divinatory calendars from highland Guatemala. They found that the 1772 calendar confirms the GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Weeks |first1=John M. |last2=Sachse |first2=Frauke |last3=Prager |first3=Christian M.|date=May 15, 2013 |title=Maya Daykeeping: Three Calendars from Highland Guatemala (Mesoamerican Worlds) |url= |location= |publisher=University Press of Colorado |pages=176–84 |isbn=978-1607322467}} In Appendix 2, ''Notes on the Correlation of Maya and Gregorian Calendars'', the authors give the examples of December 9, 1722 = 8 Kej 20 Ukab’ Si’j (8 Manik' 0 Yax) and December 9, 1723 = 9 E 20 Ukab’ Si’j (9 Eb' 0 Yax). "Using Thompson’s correlation constant of A = 584,283, all values from the calendar round correspond with the information in the 1722 K’iche’ calendar."&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the capital city of the Aztec Empire, [[Tenochtitlan]], occurred on August 13, 1521.&lt;ref&gt;(Díaz 1904: 2:129)&lt;/ref&gt; A number of different chroniclers wrote that this was a [[Tzolk'in]] ([[Tonalpohualli]]) of 1 Snake.&lt;ref&gt;(Sahagún 1975: 12:122)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Post-conquest scholars such as [[Bernardino de Sahagún|Sahagún]] and [[Diego Durán|Durán]] recorded [[Tonalpohualli]] dates with a calendar date.

Munro Edmonsen studied 60 Mesoamerican calendars, 20 of which have known correlations to European calendars, and found remarkable consistency among them and that only the GMT correlation fits the historical, ethnographic and astronomical evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Edmonson |first=Munro S. |date=1988 |title=The Book of the Year Middle American Calendrical Systems |location=Salt Lake City |publisher=University of Utah Press |page= |isbn=0-87480-288-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astronomical''': Any correct correlation must match the astronomical content of classic inscriptions. The GMT correlation does an excellent job of matching lunar data in the [[Maya calendar#Supplementary Series|supplementary series]].&lt;ref name="astras-stargate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astras-stargate.com/lunarglyphs.html |title=Lunar Glyphs in the Maya Calendrics – The Lunar Series – The Supplementary and Lunar Glyphs |publisher=astras-stargate.com|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example: An inscription at the Temple of the Sun at [[Palenque]] records that on Long Count 9.16.4.10.8 there were 26 days completed in a 30-day lunation.&lt;ref&gt;Fuls, Ancient Mesoamerica, 18 (2007), 273–282 Cambridge University Press. after Robertson 1991: Vol. 4 : p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; This Long Count is also the entry date for the eclipse table of the [[Dresden Codex]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblioteces.net/ciencia/dresden/dresdencodex03.htm The Dresden Codex eclipse table by Michael John Finley]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|According to Thompson&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, J. Eric S. (1950). Maya Hieroglyphic Writing, an Introduction. p. 236&lt;/ref&gt; "The point from which the moon age is counted is not surely known. The possibilities are disappearance of the old moon, conjunction, or appearance of the new moon... Beyer (1973a) believed that the calculation was made from the disappearance of the old moon. The latter method of counting (disappearance of the old moon) is still current in some Tzeltal, Chol, and Tzotzil villages in Chiapas..."

Using the third method (the Palenque system&lt;ref&gt;Aveni 2001&lt;/ref&gt;) the new moon would have been the first evening when one could look to the west after sunset and see the thin crescent moon. Given our modern ability to know exactly where to look, when the crescent Moon is favorably located, from an excellent site, on rare occasions, using binoculars or a telescope, observers can see and photograph the crescent moon less than one day after conjunction. Generally, most observers can't see the new Moon with the naked eye until the first evening when the lunar phase day is at least 1.5.&lt;ref&gt;"Sighting the Crescent Moon", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', July 1994, 14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"In Quest of the Youngest Moon", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', December 1996, 104–105&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Young Moons and the Islamic Calendar", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', December 1996, 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Seeking Thin Crescent Moons", ''Sky &amp; Telescope'', February 2004, 102–106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Young-Moon Hunting in 2005", ''Sky and Telescope'', February 2005, 75–76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=
What’s the Thinnest Crescent Moon You Can See? | publisher=Sky and Telescope |url=http://www.skyandtelescope.com/astronomy-news/observing-news/thinnest-crescent-moon/}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one assumes that the new moon is the first day when the lunar phase day is at least 1.5 at six in the evening in time zone UTC−6 (the time zone of the Maya area) the GMT correlation will match many lunar inscriptions exactly. In this example the lunar phase day was 27.7 (26 days counting from zero) at 6&amp;nbsp;pm after a conjunction at 1:25&amp;nbsp;am {{nowrap|October 10, 755}} and a new Moon when the lunar phase day was 1.7 at 6&amp;nbsp;pm on {{nowrap|October 11, 755}} (Julian calendar). This works well for many but not all lunar inscriptions.

Modern astronomers refer to the conjunction of the Sun and Moon (the time when the Sun and Moon have the same ecliptic longitude) as the new moon. Mesoamerican astronomy was ''observational'' not theoretical. The people of Mesoamerica didn't know about the [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernican]] nature of the solar system — they had no theoretical understanding of the orbital nature of the heavenly bodies. Some authors analyze the lunar inscriptions based on this modern understanding of the motions of the Moon but there is no evidence that the Mesoamericans did.

The first method seems to have been used for other inscriptions such as Quirgua stela E (9.17.0.0.0). Using the third method it should have a moon age of 26 days when in fact it records a new moon.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mayan and Other Ancient Calendars|author=Stray, G.|date=2007|publisher=Walker|isbn=978-0-8027-1634-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GdlzA3yUlTUC&amp;pg=PA40|page=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using the GMT correlation at six AM in time zone -six, this would be 2.25 days before conjunction, so it could record the first day when one could not see the waning moon.

Fuls&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Fuls Ancient Mesoamerica, 18 (2007), 273–282 Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Analysed these inscriptions and found strong evidence for the Palenque system and the GMT correlation however he cautioned: "Analysis of the Lunar Series shows that at least two different methods and formulas were used to calculate the moon's age and position in the six-month cycle…"|group=n}} which gives eclipse seasons when the Moon is near its [[Ascending node|ascending]] or [[Ascending node|descending]] node and an [[eclipse]] is likely to occur. Dates converted using the GMT correlation agree closely with the Dresden Codex eclipse tables.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker and Bricker pp. 249–366&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dresden Codex]] contains a [[Venus]] table which records the [[heliacal rising]]s of Venus. Using the GMT correlation these agree closely with modern astronomical calculations.&lt;ref&gt;Bricker and Bricker pp. 163–248&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Archaeological''': Various items that can be associated with specific Long Count dates have been [[Isotope dating|isotope dated]]. In 1959 the [[University of Pennsylvania]] [[carbon dating|carbon dated]] samples from ten wood lintels from [[Tikal]].&lt;ref name="jstor"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Review of radiocarbon dates from Tikal and the Maya calendar correlation problem|author= Elizabeth K. Ralph|publisher=jstor.org|jstor = 277941|volume=30|pages=421–427}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were carved with a date equivalent to 741&amp;nbsp;AD, using the GMT correlation. The average [[carbon dating|carbon date]] was 746±34 years. Recently one of these, Lintel 3 from Temple I, was analyzed again using more accurate methods and found to agree closely with the GMT correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kennett|first1=Douglas J.|last2=Hajdas|first2=Irka|last3=Culleton|first3=Brendan J.|last4=Belmecheri|first4=Soumaya|last5=Martin|first5=Simon|last6=Neff|first6=Hector|last7=Awe|first7=Jaime|last8=Graham|first8=Heather V.|last9=Freeman|first9=Katherine H.|last10=Newsom|first10=Lee|last11=Lentz|first11=David L.|last12=Anselmetti|first12=Flavio S.|last13=Robinson|first13=Mark|last14=Marwan|first14=Norbert|last15=Southon|first15=John|last16=Hodell|first16=David A.|last17=Haug|first17=Gerald H.|display-authors=1|title=Correlating the Ancient Maya and Modern European Calendars with High-Precision AMS 14C Dating|journal=Scientific Reports|date=11 April 2013|volume=3|pages=1597|doi=10.1038/srep01597|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/srep01597|bibcode = 2013NatSR...3E1597K|pmid=23579869|pmc=3623374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a proposed correlation only has to agree with one of these lines of evidence there could be numerous other possibilities. Astronomers have proposed many correlations, for example: [[Floyd Lounsbury|Lounsbury]],&lt;ref&gt;A Derivation of the Maya-to-Julian Calendar Correlation From the Dresden Codex Venus Chronology, in ''The Sky In Mayan Literature'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; Fuls, ''et al.'',&lt;ref name="archaeoastronomie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeoastronomie.de/mayaeng/corrtabl.htm |title=The Correlation Question by Andreas Fuls |publisher=archaeoastronomie.de|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Böhm and Böhm&lt;ref name="hermetic2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hermetic.ch/cal_stud/maya/boehm/korelaceangl.doc |title= Mayan Dating by Vladimir Böhm and Bohumil Böhm |publisher=hermetic.ch|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="volny"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.volny.cz/paib/ |title=Mayan dating, Mayan astronomy, Correlation MD/JD |publisher=volny.cz|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Stock.&lt;ref name="baktun"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baktun.de/English/english.html |title= Dating the Eclipse Table of the Dresden Codex and the Correlation Problem |author=Anton Stock|publisher=baktun.de|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 and the Long Count==
{{main article|2012 phenomenon}}

According to the ''[[Popol Vuh]]'', a book compiling details of [[Mesoamerican creation accounts|creation accounts]] known to the [[K'iche' people|K'iche' Maya]] of the Colonial-era highlands, we are living in the fourth world.&lt;ref name="schele1"&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel (1990), pp. 429–30&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Popol Vuh'' describes the first three creations that the gods failed in making and the creation of the successful fourth world where men were placed. In the Maya Long Count, the previous creation ended at the start of a 14th b'ak'tun.

The previous creation ended on a Long Count of 12.19.19.17.19. Another 12.19.19.17.19 occurred on December 20, 2012 (Gregorian Calendar), followed by the start of the 14th b'ak'tun, 13.0.0.0.0, on December 21, 2012.{{#tag:ref|Various sources place this on other dates, notably on December 23.&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Friedel (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;|group=n}} There are only two references to the current creation's 13th b'ak'tun in the fragmentary Mayan corpus: [[Tortuguero (Maya site)|Tortuguero]] Monument 6, part of a ruler's inscription and the recently discovered La Corona Hieroglyphic Stairway 2, Block V.&lt;ref name="wordpress"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://decipherment.wordpress.com/2012/06/30/notes-on-a-new-text-from-la-corona/|title=Notes on a New Text from La Corona « Maya Decipherment|publisher=decipherment.wordpress.com|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maya inscriptions occasionally reference future predicted events or commemorations that would occur on dates that lie beyond 2012 (that is, beyond the completion of the 13th ''b'ak'tun'' of the current era). Most of these are in the form of "distance dates" where some Long Count date is given, together with a Distance Number that is to be added to the Long Count date to arrive at this future date.

For example, on the west panel at the [[Temple of Inscriptions]] in [[Palenque]], a section of the text projects into the future to the 80th Calendar Round (CR) 'anniversary' of the famous Palenque ruler [[K'inich Janaab' Pakal]]'s accession to the throne (Pakal's accession occurred on a Calendar Round date 5 Lamat 1 Mol, at Long Count 9.9.2.4.8 equivalent to 27 July 615 CE in the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]]).&lt;ref group=n&gt;Gregorian, using GMT correlation JDN=584283.&lt;/ref&gt; It does this by commencing with Pakal's birthdate 9.8.9.13.0{{nbsp|2}}8 Ajaw 13 Pop (24 March {{nowrap|603 CE Gregorian}}) and adding to it the Distance Number 10.11.10.5.8.&lt;ref name="Schele 1992, pp.93–95"&gt;Schele (1992, pp. 93–95)&lt;/ref&gt; 

This calculation arrives at the 80th Calendar Round since his accession, a day that also has a CR date of {{nowrap|5 Lamat 1 Mol}}, but which lies over 4,000 years in the future from Pakal's time—the day 21 October in the year 4772. The inscription notes {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} that this day would fall eight days after the completion of the 1st ''piktun'' [since the creation or zero date of the Long Count system], where the ''piktun'' is the next-highest order above the ''b'ak'tun'' in the Long Count. If the completion date of that ''piktun''—13 October 4772—were to be written out in Long Count notation, it could be represented as 1.0.0.0.0.0. The 80th CR anniversary date, eight days later, would be 1.0.0.0.0.8{{nbsp|2}}{{nowrap|5 Lamat 1 Mol}}.&lt;ref name="Schele 1992, pp.93–95"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schele &amp; Freidel (1990, p. 430 ''n.''39)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the publicity generated by the 2012 date, Susan Milbrath, curator of Latin American Art and Archaeology at the [[Florida Museum of Natural History]], stated that "We have no record or knowledge that [the Maya] would think the world would come to an end" in 2012.&lt;ref name=Milbrath&gt;{{cite news | title=Does Maya calendar predict 2012 apocalypse? | work=USA Today | first=G.

==Converting between the Long Count and western calendars==

===Calculating a western calendar date from a Long Count===

'''It's important to know the difference between the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] and [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]] calendars when doing these conversions.''' &lt;ref group=n&gt;In 46 BC Julius Caesar adopted the convention of having three years of twelve months of approximately 30 days each to make a year of 365 days and a leap year of 366 days. This made the length of the civil year 365.25 days, close to the length of the solar year of 365.2422 days. This is the [[Julian calendar]]. By 1582 there was an appreciable discrepancy between the [[winter solstice]] and [[Christmas]] and the [[Equinox|spring equinox]] and [[Easter]]. [[Pope Gregory XIII]], with the help of Italian astronomer [[Aloysius Lilius]] ([[Luigi Lilio]]), reformed this system by abolishing the days October 5 through October 14, 1582. This brought the civil and tropical years closer together. He also missed three days every four centuries by decreeing that centuries are only leap years if they are evenly divisible by 400. So for example 1700, 1800 and 1900 are not leap years but 1600 and 2000 are. This is the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Astronomical calculations will return a year zero and years before that are negative numbers. This is astronomical dating. Years before 46 BC are calculated as [[Proleptic Julian calendar|proleptic Julian dates]]. There is no year zero in historical dating. In historical dating the year 1 BC is followed by the year 1
For example, the year −3113 (astronomical dating) is the same as 3114 BC (historical dating). Many books about the Maya and many computer programs to do Maya calendar conversions use the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]] In this calendar all dates before the start of the [[Gregorian calendar]] are revised as if the [[Gregorian calendar]] had been in use before its adoption in October of 1582. Although this system is popular among [[Mayanists]], it is rarely used by anyone else, so for example, dates converted using this system are useless for the study of [[Maya Astronomy]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Using as an example the Long Count date of 9.10.11.17.0 (Long Count date mentioned on the Palenque Palace Tablet), first calculate the number of days that have passed since the zero date (August 11, 3114 BC; GMT correlation, in the [[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]], September 6, −3113 [[Proleptic Julian calendar|Julian]] astronomical).
&lt;center&gt;

|}
&lt;/center&gt;

Then add the GMT correlation to the total number of days.

:  1,372,300 + 584,283 = 1,956,583

This number is a '''[[Julian day]]'''.

'''To convert a [[Julian day]] to a ''[[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]]'' date:'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wayeb.org/download/resources/wh2014english.pdf |title=Introduction to Maya Hieroglyphs |last1=Kettunen |first1=Harri |last2=Helmke |first2=Christophe |date=2014 |publisher=Wayeb, Comenius University in Bratislava, The Slovak Archaeological and Historical Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this number, subtract the nearest smaller Julian Day Number (in the table below), in this case 1&amp;thinsp;940&amp;thinsp;206, which corresponds to the year 600 AD.

:  1,956,583 – 1,940,206 = 16,377

Next, divide this number by 365 days (vague year).

:  16,377 / 365 = 44.86849

The remainder is 44.86849 years, which is 44 years and 317 days. The full year date is 644 AD. Now calculate the month and day number, taking into account leap days over the 44 years. In the Gregorian Calendar, every fourth year is a leap year with the exception of centuries not evenly divisible by 400 (e.g. 100, 200, 300). When the year is divisible by 400 (e.g. 400, 800, etc.), do not add an extra day. Our calculated year is 644 AD. The number of leap days, keeping in mind that the year 600 is not a leap year, is 10. Subtracting that from 317 remainder days is 307; in other words, the 307th day of the year 644 AD, which is November 3.
To summarize: the Long Count date 9.10.11.17.0 corresponds to November 3, 644 AD, in the ''[[Proleptic Gregorian calendar]]''.

'''To convert a [[Julian day]] to a Julian/Gregorian astronomical date ([[Proleptic Julian calendar]] before 46 BC):'''

Use an astronomical algorithm such as the ''Method of [[Jean Meeus|Meeus]]''&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meeus (1991–2009 with corrections as of August 10, 2009). ''Astronomical Algorithms'' Second Edition Willman-Bell publishers {{ISBN|0-943396-61-1}} Chapter 7 ''Julian Day'' p. 63&lt;/ref&gt; to convert the [[Julian day]] to a Julian/Gregorian date with astronomical dating of negative years:

'''Important''': Astronomical algorithms calculate a day as a decimal number equal to a day and a fraction of a day. The Julian date starts at noon. [[astronomical year numbering|Astronomical]] dating has a year 0. In historical dating the year 1 BCE is followed by the year 1. Astronomical years before 0 are written with a negative sign. For example, the year 3114 BCE is the year −3113 astronomical.

In this Example:

add 0.5 to the Julian day    (1,956,583.5)&lt;br&gt;
calculate Z integer part    (1,956,583)&lt;br&gt;
calculate decimal number F fraction part    (0.5)&lt;br&gt;
if Z &lt; 2,299,161 (Gregorian?)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;integer A = Z&lt;br&gt;
else{&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;integer alpha = floor((Z – 1,867,216.25) / 36,524.25)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (15)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;A = Z + 1 + alpha – floor(alpha / 4.0)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (2,436,129)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;}&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer B = A + 1524    (1,958,107)&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer C = floor((B – 122.1) / 365.25)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;    (5,360)&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer D = floor(365.25 * C)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;    (1,957,740)&lt;br&gt;
calculate integer E = floor((B – D) /30.6001)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;    (11)&lt;br&gt;
decimal number day = B – D – floor(30.6001 * E)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + F    (31.5)&lt;br&gt;
if(E &lt; 14)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; integer month = E – 1    (10)&lt;br&gt;
else&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; month = E – 13&lt;br&gt;
if(month &gt; 2)&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; integer year = C – 4,716    (644)&lt;br&gt;
else&lt;br&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;year = C – 4715

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;The floor operation is rounding a decimal number down to the next lowest integer. For example, floor(1.5) = 1 and floor(−1.5) = -2

In this example the ''[[Julian calendar|Julian]]'' date is noon October 31, 644. The Method of [[Jean Meeus|Meeus]] isn't valid for negative [[Julian day number]]s, so another method such as the method of Peter Baum&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20140910060704/http://mysite.verizon.net/aesir_research/date/date0.htm&lt;/ref&gt; should be used.

===Calculating a full Long Count date===
[[File:Morley 1915 ISglyphs.svg|thumb|right|160px|[[Chichen Itza]] Initial Series inscription. This date (glyphs A2, B2, …, A5) is 10.2.9.1.9 &amp;nbsp; 9 Muluk 7 Sak, equivalent to July 28, 878 (GMT Gregorian).]]

As stated, a full Long Count date not only includes the five digits of the Long Count, but the 2-character Tzolk'in and the two-character Haab' dates as well. The five digit Long Count can therefore be confirmed with the other four characters (the "calendar round date").

Taking as an example a Calendar Round date of 9.12.2.0.16 (Long Count) 5 Kib' (Tzolk'in) 14 Yaxk'in (Haab'). One can check whether this date is correct by the following calculation.

It is perhaps easier to find out how many days there are since 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk'u and show how the date 5 Kib' 14 Yaxk'in is derived.
&lt;center&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|- align=right
| 9 ||× 144000||= 1296000
|- align=right
| 12 ||× 7200 ||= 86400
|- align=right
| 2 ||× 360 ||= 720
|- align=right
| 0 ||× 20 ||= 0
|- align=right
| 16 ||× 1 ||= 16
|-
| ||Total days||= 1383136
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

===Calculating the Tzolk'in date portion===
The Tzolk'in date is counted forward from 4 Ajaw. To calculate the numerical portion of the Tzolk'in date, add 4 to the total number of days given by the date and then divide total number of days by 13.

: (4 + 1,383,136) / 13 = 106,395 (and 5/13)

This means that 106,395 whole 13-day cycles have been completed and the numerical portion of the Tzolk'in date is 5.

To calculate the day, divide the total number of days in the long count by 20 since there are twenty day names.

:1,383,136 / 20 = 69,156 (and 16/20)

This means 16 day names must be counted from Ajaw. This gives Kib'. Therefore, the Tzolk'in date is 5 Kib'.

===Calculating the Haab' date portion===
The Haab' date 8 Kumk'u is the ninth day of the eighteenth month. There are 17 days to the start of the next year.

Subtract 17 days from the total, to find how many complete Haab' years are contained.

:138,3136 − 17 = 1,383,119

Divide by 365

:1,383,119 / 365 = 3,789 and (134/365)

Therefore, 3,789 complete Haab' have passed and the remainder 134 is the 135th day in the new Haab', since a remainder of 0 would indicate the first day.

Find which month the day is in. Dividing the remainder 134 by 20, is six complete months and a remainder of 14, indicating the 15th day. So, the date in the Haab' lies in the seventh month, which is Yaxk'in. The fifteenth day of Yaxk'in is 14, thus the Haab' date is 14 Yaxk'in.

So the date of the long count date 9.12.2.0.16 5 Kib' 14 Yaxk'in is confirmed.

==Piktuns and higher orders==
There are also four rarely used higher-order periods above the b'ak'tun: ''piktun'', ''kalabtun'', ''k'inchiltun'' and ''alautun''. All of these words are inventions of Mayanists. Each one consists of 20 of the lesser units.&lt;ref&gt;Thompson (1960 Appendix IV pp. 314, 316, 148–49) "I have throughout assumed that the baktuns were grouped, not in 13's, but in 20's, for the evidence supporting a vigesimal count of baktuns in Dresden and at Palenque and Copan is too strong to be overridden."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grofe, Michael John 2007 The Serpent Series: Precession in the Maya Dresden Codex p. 55 "On occasion, the Maya also recorded intervals of time even greater than 13 B’ak’tuns, such as one Piktun, composed of 20 B’ak’tuns. This is relevant to the current discussion concerning the Serpent Series."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.penn.museum/sites/expedition/time-kingship-and-the-maya-universe-maya-calendars/ Martin Time Kingship and the Maya Universe] "…we have clear evidence that the current Bak’tun cycle does not conclude at 13, as the last one did, but advances to 20. In other words, 13.0.0.0.0 will be followed by 14.0.0.0.0, 15.0.0.0.0, and so on to 19.0.0.0.0. A text at the site of Palenque, Mexico, makes this very plain when it records the completion of 1 Piktun, the next unit above the Bak’tun, in 4772 CE.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many inscriptions give the date of the current creation as a large number of 13s preceding 13.0.0.0.0 4 Ahau 8 Kumk'u. For example, a Late Classic monument from [[Coba]], Stela 1. The date of creation is expressed as 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.0.0.0.0, where the units are 13s in the nineteen places larger than the b'ak'tun.&lt;ref&gt;''Fig. 444'' in Wagner (2006, p. 283)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schele and Freidel (1992, p. 430).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Freidel, L. Schele And J. Parker, Maya Cosmos: Three Thousand Years On The Shaman's Path, 1993:62, Fig. 2:1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="famsi2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.famsi.org/schele_list.php?_allSearch=Coba&amp;hold_search=&amp;tab=schele&amp;title=Schele+Drawing+Collection&amp;x=34&amp;y=12|title=Schele Drawing Collection|publisher=research.famsi.org|accessdate=2015-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some authors think that the 13s were symbolic of a completion and don't represent an actual number.&lt;ref name="Lloyd B. Anderson 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.traditionalhighcultures.org/20_or_13_Baktuns_in_Pictun.pdf|title=Lloyd B.

Most inscriptions that use these are in the form of distance dates and Long Reckonings – they give a base date, a distance number that is added or subtracted and the resulting Long Count.

The first example below is from Schele (1987 p.). The second is from Stuart (2005 pp.&amp;nbsp;60, 77)[https://web.archive.org/web/20091117031111/http://www.traditionalhighcultures.org/Distances_across_Era_Date.pdf]

The [[Dresden codex]] contains another method for writing distance numbers. These are Ring Numbers. Specific dates within the [[Dresden codex]] are often given by calculations involving Ring Numbers. [[Ernst Förstemann|Förstemann]]&lt;ref&gt;Förstemann, Ernst Commentary on the Maya Manuscript in the Royal Public Library of Dresden – Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Archaeology and Ethnography, Harvard University Vol. IV. No. 2. pp. 222–64&lt;/ref&gt; identified these, but Wilson (1924:24–25) later clarified the way in which they operate. Ring Numbers are intervals of days between the Era Base date 4 Ajaw 8 Kumk’u and an earlier Ring Base date, where the place-holder for the numeral of days in the interval is circled by an image of a tied red band.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4247">Between 2008 and 2011, the '''Milton Friedman Institute for Research in Economics'''  was an academic center established at the [[University of Chicago]] as a collaborative, cross-disciplinary site for research in economics. The Institute aimed to advance, refine, and share research that applied the tools of economic analysis to real-world issues. The institute was named in honor of former Chicago economics professor, [[Milton Friedman]], who is widely recognized for his many enduring contributions to economic analysis. The institute was a collaboration of the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, Department of Economics, and Law School and fostered inquiry across a wide range of topics and subfields. The institute aimed to advance and preserve the unique University of Chicago economic tradition of combining theory and data in rigorous analysis--an approach exemplified by Friedman and others. 

The Institute hosted visiting scholars working in subfields of economics, business, law, and related fields such as public policy and medicine. It hosted workshops, seminars, and lectures on fundamental questions across these fields. The Institute also supported advanced professional training for post-doctoral students, as well as expanded opportunities for University of Chicago graduate students. When announcing the creation of the institute in 2008, University President Robert J. Zimmer said its goal was to create "a primary intellectual destination for economics by creating a robust forum for engagement of our faculty and students with scholars and policymakers from around the world.”&lt;ref name="mfiannounce"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 15, 2008 |title=University of Chicago economists to focus their pioneering research in new institute honoring the memory of Milton Friedman |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2008/05/15/university-chicago-economists-focus-their-pioneering-research-new-institute-honor }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university had initially planned to invest $200 million in the institute, with half of that in the form of an operating endowment; though the majority of funds were to be raised through donations.

The institute was an object of intense controversy at the university, as many faculty objected both to its objectives as originally framed and to the naming of an institute after Friedman, who was viewed as polarizing. The announcement of the institute drew a response from more than 170 of the faculty at the university, who argued that to found such an institute would constitute "a symbolic endorsement of his views by the University" and that the proposal reflected "a very narrow research scope even within the field of economics, not to speak of the complete disregard for other disciplines involved in the study of 'economy and society'".&lt;ref name=corespetition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.miltonfriedmancores.org/cores/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807201459/http://www.miltonfriedmancores.org/cores/ |archivedate=2011-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, the institute and the Becker Center on Chicago Price Theory were joined to form the new [[Becker Friedman Institute for Research in Economics]].&lt;ref name="bfiannounce"&gt;{{cite web |date=June 17, 2011 |title=Becker Friedman Institute established at University of Chicago |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2011/06/17/becker-friedman-institute-established-university-chicago }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Minan-ur-Rehman-Book.jpg|150px|thumb|Book-Title '''Minan-ur-Rehman'' '''(1895)]]
{{Ahmadiyya}}
'''Arabic - the Mother of all Languages - (Book) ''' ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' [Arabic: منن الرّحمٰن ] is a brief treatise on Philology by   [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], (1835-1908) written in May 1895. Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the first language taught to man by God Himself and the Mother of all languages (Arabic: ''Ummul-al-Sinnah''). He highlighted certain peculiarities of the Arabic language, which he claimed could not be found in any other language and challenged his adversaries, to refute his claim also addressing [[Max Muller]] (1823-1900) to come forward and meet the challenge.

==A 20th Century Prophet Ahmad==
::"From my early age, I have been engaged in investigations in religion, I have never reconciled myself with mere platitudes or cursory observations ;  I have never been content with superficial ideas as is the wont of every dull person who is a prisoner of ignorance and untruth. I have never insisted upon baseless ideas, as is the habit of a narrow-minded person who had no desire to understand. Never has anything moved me towards anything except with the eye of penetrating research and except for the attraction of deep-delving insight, nothing has ever lured me into professing a formal creed. And no one has taught me except God Who is the best of all teachers." (page 35)

==Introduction to the book==
:: "So, I named the book منن الرّحمٰن .  [Literally]  ''Favours of the Beneficent God'',   for by many a variety of Grace and Favour, God Almighty bestowed a reward on me, and He is the best of the Givers of favours". (page. 77)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=Urdu#page/126/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman, (Arabic), by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad (1895)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A short Treatise, namely ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' (1895) English translation by Qazi Abdul Hameed, Lahore (1963)  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/volume/Ruhani_Khazain/book/Minan_ur_Rehman/?l=English#page/-3/mode/1up Minan-ur-Rahman (English Translation) 1963 by Qazi Abdul Hameed]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apparently the book appears to be in response to [[Max Muller]]'s belief that:
::: “I, therefore, date the real beginning of the science of language from the first day of [[Pentecost]].” &lt;ref&gt;Lectures on the Science of Language,  page 53. [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/32856/32856-0.txt] page 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmad strongly reacted to this claim and  refuted [[Max Muller]]'s proposition by referring him to the NT Acts II:4-6, explaining that the Disciples only spoke languages already known and understood by all the Jews &lt;ref&gt;"And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance ... Now when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language." -Acts 2:4,6"&lt;/ref&gt;
Ahmad writes, he very earnestly prayed to God, and asked for true knowledge in this regard. So God diverted his attention to a verse of the Quran 30:23.
:: وَمِنْ ءَايَـتِهِ خَلْقُ السَّمَـوَتِ وَالاٌّرْضِ وَاخْتِلَـفُ أَلْسِنَتِكُمْ وَأَلْوَنِكُمْ
::إِنَّ فِى ذلِكَ لأَيَـتٍ لِّلْعَـلَمِينَ
[The Quran, 30:23] And among His Signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the diversity of your tongues and colours. In that surely are Signs for those who possess knowledge.

Ahmad claimed in light of Quranic verses:
::"All praise is due to Allah, the Sustainer, the Beneficent. To Him belongs all Excellence, Grace and Goodness. He created man and taught him a plain language. And out of one language He created various languages in different countries just as He created various colors (of mankind); out of one color. And He made Arabic the mother of all languages. He made it the like of the sun in brightness and luster."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alislam.org/topics/arabic/ Minan-ur-Rahman - Arabic - the mother of all languages]&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed, the true Science of Languages has been taught in the Holy Quran, explaining the unique characteristics of the Arabic language. "He created man then taught him speech and guided him " (page 85).

==Unique Characteristics of Arabic==
In this book ''Minan-ur-Rahman'' Ahmad claimed that Arabic was the very First Language, taught to man by God. Ahmad describes the system of ''Mufradaat'' [the Simples or the Roots of words] in the Arabic Language had a unique scientific organization and a system, unknown in any other language. He described the five peculiarities of Arabic and claimed, all other languages of man, were derived from Arabic,

He explained, in the Arabic language, even the lonely alphabets (a, b, c etc.) at times manifest full and extensive meanings. e.g.:( see pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11)

فِ  (fi) 'Be faithful'

قِ  (qi) 'Keep an eye on'

لِ  (li) 'Come nearer'

عِ  ('I) 'Call to mind'

اِ   (I)  'Promise'

خِ  (Khe)  'Go, neither slowly nor fast, but with rather moderate pace'

ہِ   (hi)  'Burst thyself, or become weak'

دِ   (di)  'Pay blood-money'

رِ   (ri)  'Flare up, become brighter, or come out of the fireplace.' or 'Become dirty'

شِ  (shi)  'Paint thy garments with patterns '

نِ   (ni)   'Be slow or lazy'

Ahmad goes on explaining, sometimes even small '''single words''' give extensive meanings: e.g.

عرضتُ  (''araztu'') means: "I have roamed about Makkah, Madina, and all the habitations around them."

طہفلتُ  (''Tahfaltu'') means: "I eat and have determined always to eat Millet bread ."

جثمَ  (''Jasama'')  means: "Half the night has passed".

حیعلَ  (''Haya-al'')  means: "Come; Pray!  It is proper time."

==The Mother Language==
"The Arabic language possesses excellent qualities and signs which, in the eyes of scholars, invest it with the status of a Mother in relation to
other languages, and these languages are like a shadow in relation to Arabic or like sparrows in relation to a preying falcon." (page  100).

Ahmad believed that Arabic, being the First Language, however, in due course of time, great changes in the structure and form of the vocal apparatus, man's ecology and environment, and many other unknown factors, caused a diversification of Arabic language into thousands of tongues, all derived from Arabic. He writes, quoting from the Hebrew Torah,  Genesis 11:1:-
::: ויהי כל הארץ שׂפה אחת ודברים אחדים׃
:::"And the whole earth was one lip and speeches identical". (Gen, 11:1) [page. 14]
::...the nearness or remoteness of a place from the equator, of the distinctive effect of the various plants, and because of other unknown factors, every locality inheres in its inhabitants a proclivity of a special kind, towards developing a peculiar voice-apparatus, a distinctive accent, and a form of words which is of a peculiar character....[page: 12]

He after commenting upon the relationship of Hebrew, or Sanskrit to Arabic, writes:
::...all the languages of the world have come into existence through a process of far  reaching change, yet by fully pondering over it, and by looking at the operative factors, it clearly appears that the speeches and words of these languages have been transplanted into a variety of shapes and forms from Arabic simples. [page. 16]

::"Arabic is singular in its attributes, perfect in its root-words, wonderful  in the charm of its compounds and captivating in the structural beauty of its sentences." (page 105).

==Five Points of Excellence==
Ahmad highlighted ''Five'' points of the excellence of the Arabic language: [page. 17]

1. Arabic has a complete organised structure of roots, that is to say, the roots meet fully all the needs of human beings in the field of expression ; the other languages are not so fitted.

2. In Arabic, the names of the Divine Being, the names of the principal constituent parts of the universe, of plants, animals and minerals and of the members of the human body, possess, in the why and wherefore of their contents, deep philosophy and learning.

3. The Additions and the roots of Arabic words are perfectly organised. The scope of this organisation, by linking into one philosophical chain, all the verbs and nouns, belonging to the same root, points out their interrelationships. This is not to be found, to this degree of excellence, in other languages.

4. In Arabic expressions, words are few but meanings are many, that is to say, the Arabic language makes use of (ا) [alif], and (ل) [laam] and nunnation (تنوین) and the sequence of words, in such a way that to express the same meaning the other languages need a number of sentences to be linked up for the same purpose.

5. Arabic possesses roots and expressions which are the perfect means of portraying the most delicate and deep things of the mind and human ideas.

A greater part of the book is devoted to manifest these characteristic in further details. He writes, " Thousands of languages
are stricken with the calamity of a drawback that instead of root-words they make use of complex grammatical constructions, which shows that at a time of need such constructions have been invented by man." [page. 22]

==Arabic follows the Law of Nature==
After the above  ''Introductory details'', the rest of the treatise is in a very lucid and elegant Arabic.[page 27-127]
He explains that Arabic is unique to follow the patterns we observe in Nature. Two distinct features, i.e.'the pre-existing' Grace of God, like the bounties of Nature, the qualities inherent in the soil and earth, the sun and the changing weathers etc. And the second aspect being human efforts, labour and endeavours, these combine to give birth to the fruit of human endeavours. To fulfil these ''Two'' requirements,  Arabic has ''Two'' distinct words for ''Mercy'', ''Rahman'' [رحمان]and ''Raheem''. [رحیم].
To explain his point, Ahmad writes:
::It will be noticed that in as much  this quality Mercy, in accordance with the eternal distribution process. consisted of two manifestations of the Divine Law of Nature. there are to be found two root-words in the Arabic language to express that fact. And for a seeker of Truth. it would be profitable to follow the rule that the Attributes and Acts of God which are prominently portrayed in the Book of Nature should be taken as a standard, that their different categories which are apparent from the Law of Nature should be searched for in the root-words of Arabic, and that when ever it is intended to point out the difference between Arabic synonyms, which relate to the attributes or the acts of God, one should turn to the division and distribution of the attributes or acts of God which are apparent from the working of the universe, for, the real object of the Arabic language is the service of Divine Knowledge, as the real aim of the creation of man is the recognition of the Creator. [page. 35]

==Ten Categories of Arabic Roots==
Ahmad believed that Arabic was the Language of Divine Realization and designed to fulfill the Physical and Spiritual needs of man. He classified the Arabic Root-Words, into ten categories, calling them as the ''Ten Circles of Roots''. He describes them as follows: (pp: 38-40)

::1) Root-words  relating to the Person of God, arguments for the existence of God, His attributes, His Names and Acts, His Practice and Custom.

::2)  The system of root-words relating to the Unity of God and the arguments on behalf thereof.

::3) The system of root-words which deals with the attributes, acts, and actions, habits and situations, spiritual and physical, (of man) which, along with their mutual distinctions, are perpetrated by man and which may appear,  in agreement with or in opposition to God's Will.

::4) The system of root-words which constitute, as facts of Divine knowledge; a perfected  teaching from God Almighty and which relate to inculcations or techniques dealing with morals, beliefs, rights of God, rights of men, philosophic learning, punishments, commandments, the Do's and Dont's.

::5) The system of root-words which expound the nature of true salvation, the true means or methods of obtaining it; the signs by which the saved believers and those who occupy a station  of nearness to God may be recognized.

::6) The system of root-words which explain what is Islam, what is disbelief, what is ''shirk'' or polytheistic belief and which deal forth with the arguments for the truth of Islam, and refute the objections against Islam.

::7) The system of root-words which refute all the wrong beliefs of opponents.

::8) The system of root-words which relate to warnings and tidings, promise of favourable or adverse happenings ; which relate to description of the hereafter, to miracles and to parables or which are of the nature of prophecies which contribute to the strengthening of one's faith, or which relate to other expedient subjects, or which deal with narratives which are meant as a warning, a threat, or a tiding.

::9) The system of root-words which relate to the life-story and chaste qualities of the Holy Prophet (May peace and blessings of God be upon him,) which consist of the high example of the pure life of the Holy Prophet ; which also partake of full and forceful arguments in support of the prophet-hood of the Holy Prophet (may peace and the blessings of God be upon him.)

::10) The system of root-words which expound the beauties and the spiritual effectiveness of the Holy Quran and which set out its inherent qualities.

==Language as the Evolution of ''Names''==
How did language come into being? To quote Encyclopædia Britannica: " On the ultimate origin of language speculation has been rife, more, however, among philosophers than among philologists, who have very often been too matter-of-fact to take an interest in this problem. Some scholars (among them quite recently W. Schmidt) see the insufficiency of the usual theories, and giving up all attempts at explaining it in a natural way fall back on the religious belief that the first language was directly given to the first men by God through a miracle."  &lt;ref&gt;[http://gluedideas.com/content-collection/Encyclopedia-Britannica-Volume-13-Part-2-Kurantwad-Statue-of-Liberty/The-Origin-of-Language.html Origin of Language Encyclopædia Britannica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Archaeology and Bible history, (1992) by Joseph P. Free, page 43 (W. Schmidt on Language, [https://books.google.com.pk/books?id=haVoe4n0ifIC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

::"When man was made to evolve through stages of creation ; when he was transferred from a state of potentiality to one of actuality, when he was given, in his nature and physical evolution, different shapes and figures, and some of the varieties of creation succeeded other varieties, and there happened to be mutual differences and distinctions, the process gave rise to many degrees and stages which required to be described by ''Names'',  Arabic provided them with their "names", and thus completed its gift as is the custom of rich philanthropists." (page 123)

==Further Contributions ==
A renowned Philologist Sheikh [[Muhammad Ahmad Mazhar]] (1896-1993) has contributed immensely to the work of [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]] and studied the various languages (around 35) and traced them to their Arabic Root-Words. The works, which trace the Arabic Roots, are the dictionary format, are easily available, can be downloaded freely by pasting the links in the browser's address bar. Most of the work is yet unpublished and in MSS forms.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9189">'''Museum folklore''' is a domain of scholarship and professional practice within the field of folklore studies ([[folkloristics]]).

{{Portal|Folklore}} 

== Characteristics ==
Some museum folklorists work full-time in museums of [[ethnography]], [[ethnology]], [[cultural history]], or [[folk art]], often as educators, [[curators]], and directors. Others work in other settings, such as in [[public folklore]] programs, academic departments, community-based organizations, and consultancies. Such folklorists either partner with museums in the development of scholarly and public programs or study the history and impact of such work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C. Kurt|title=Folklife and Museum Practice: An Intertwined History and Emerging Convergences|journal=Journal of American Folklore|date=2014|volume=127|issue=505|pages=247–263|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key themes in museum folklore include policies and practices relating to tangible and intangible [[cultural heritage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China-US Folklore and Intangible Cultural Heritage Project|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intangible Cultural Heritage and Ethnographic Museum Practice|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FICH2|website=American Folklore Society|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums as [[sites of conscience]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Museum of International Folk Art (USA)|url=http://www.sitesofconscience.org/members/museum-of-international-folk-art/|website=International Coalition of Sites of Conscience|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; museums and cultural tourism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kirshenblatt-Gimblett|first1=Barbara|title=Destination Culture: Tourism, Museums, and Heritage|date=1998|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0520209664}}&lt;/ref&gt; and museums as sites of innovation relative to the digital preservation, presentation, and access to cultural heritage collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bol|first1=Marsha|last2=Dewhurst|first2=C. Kurt|last3=Hertz|first3=Carrie|last4=Jackson|first4=Jason Baird|last5=MacDowell|first5=Marsha|last6=Seeman|first6=Charlie|last7=Seriff|first7=Suzy|last8=Sheehy|first8=Daniel|title=Rethinking the Role of Folklore in Museums: Exploring New Directions for Folklore in Museum Policy and Practice|date=2015|publisher=American Folklore Society|location=Bloomington, IN|url=http://www.afsnet.org/?page=FLMuseum|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum folklore practice has often focused on ways of animating the object-centered nature of the museum through events and activities that bring the people behind heritage collections into engagement with museum audiences, as through such activities as museum-based [[artist in residency]] programs, [[folk festivals]], and art and craft sales markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hall|first1=Patricia|last2=Seeman|first2=Charlie|title=Folklife and Museums: Selected Readings|date=1987|publisher=American Association of State and Local History|location=Nashville, TN|isbn=0910050856|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/15521284|accessdate=11 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is significant interaction and overlap between museum folklore and the neighboring field of [[museum anthropology]], as well as the interdisciplinary field of [[material culture]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berlinger|first1=Gabrielle A.|title=Ethnography as a Strategy in Museum Preservation|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=34-34|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dewhurst|first1=C. Kurt|last2=MacDowell|first2=Marsha|title=Strategies for Creating and Sustaining Museum-Based International Collaborative Partnerships|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=54–55|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hertz|first1=Carrie|title=Finding the Local in the Global in the 21st Century|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=56-56|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Jason Baird|title=Interconnections: Folklore Studies and Anthropology at the Mathers Museum of World Cultures|journal=Practicing Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|issue=3|pages=20–23|doi=10.17730/0888-4552-37.3.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum folklore is often understood as a sub-area of the wider realm of [[public folklore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baron|first1=Robert|last2=Spitzer|first2=Nicholas R.|title=Public Folklore|date=2007|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=9781604733167|edition=3rd|url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/607552460}}&lt;/ref&gt; In North America, the historical connections linking anthropology and folklore studies more broadly are of particular relevance to museum folklorists because many early leaders of the American folklore society were also anthropologists active in museums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Darnell|first1=Regna|title=American Anthropology and the Development of Folklore Scholarship: 1890-1920|journal=Journal of the Folklore Institute|date=1973|volume=10|issue=1-2|pages=23–39|doi=10.2307/3813878}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe, what is here referred to as museum folklore would often fall within the field of European [[ethnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Niedermüller|first1=Peter|last2=Stoklund|first2=Bjarne|title=Special Issue: Museum and Modernity|journal=Ethnologia Europaea|date=2004|volume=33|issue=1|pages=1–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museum folklore is also often understood as a part of the sub-field of [[folklife]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bronner|first1=Simon J.|title=Encyclopedia of American Folklife|date=2006|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=9780765680525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizations ==

An organizational home for the sub-field in the United States and Canada is the [http://www.afsnet.org/?page=MuseumSection Folklore and Museums section] of the [[American Folklore Society]]. Among folklorists, this section is cognate to the [[Council for Museum Anthropology]] among museum anthropologists.

The '''Universidad Nacional de Colombia''' ({{lang-en|'''National University of Colombia'''}}) is a [[public university|public]], [[National university|national]], [[coeducation]]al, [[research]] [[university]], located primarily in [[Bogotá, D.C.|Bogotá]], [[Medellín]], [[Manizales]] and [[Palmira, Valle del Cauca|Palmira]], [[Colombia]]. Established in 1867 by an [[statute|act]] of the [[Congress of Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unal.edu.co/contenido/sobre_un/sobreun_resena.htm |title=Universidad Nacional de Colombia - Reseña histórica |accessdate=2008-01-13 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; the university is the largest higher education institution of the country with more than 44,000 students, the largest number of graduated professionals per year, and number of academic programmes at [[undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate education|graduate]] levels, with 430 academic programmes, which includes 96 [[graduate diploma]]s, 67 [[academic specialization]]s, 39 [[Specialty (medicine)|medical specialties]], 161 [[master's degree]]s, and 58 [[doctorate]]s. It is also one of the few universities that employs post-doctorate [[Research fellow|fellows]] in the country. Approximately 40,000 students are studying for an undergraduate degree and 4,000 for a graduate degree. The National University of Colombia is one of the best universities in Colombia and Latin America, for its high degree of education and research achievement in several [[rankings of universities in Latin America]] and around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.scimagoir.com/pdf/iber_new/SIR%20Iber%202015%20HE.pdf|title= SIR Iber 2015 Rank: Output|accessdate= 6 August 2016|work= scimagoir.com|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160221191307/http://www.scimagoir.com/pdf/iber_new/SIR%20Iber%202015%20HE.pdf|archivedate= 21 February 2016|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is a member of the [[Association of Colombian Universities]] (ASCUN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascun.org.co/afiliada.htm |title=Universidades Afiliadas |work= |accessdate=2009-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122143757/http://www.ascun.org.co/afiliada.htm |archivedate=November 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Iberoamerican Association of Postgraduate Universities]] (AUIP),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auip.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=282&amp;Itemid=196&amp;lang=es |title=Instituciones Asociadas a la AUIP |accessdate=2009-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002060502/http://www.auip.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=282&amp;Itemid=196&amp;lang=es |archivedate=2009-10-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Iberoamerican University Network [[Universia]].

==Campus==

===Bogota Branch===
The [[University City of Bogotá]] ({{lang-es|Ciudad Universitaria de Bogotá}}), also known as the White City ({{lang-es|Ciudad Blanca}}), is the flagship University campus.  It is located in the [[Teusaquillo]] locality, northwest of the historical center.  It is also the largest campus in Colombia, with an extension of {{convert|1200000|m2|acre|abbr=on}} and a constructed area of {{convert|308541|m2|acre|abbr=on}}, making it an ample campus with several green areas, open spaces, and pedestrian paths.  Among its buildings there are 17 which have been declared national monuments and, as a whole, it is a representation of the last 60 years of [[architecture]] in Colombia.

[[Image:PlazaCheoSantanderUNAL.JPG|thumb|right|Central square, Bogota's campus]]The campus was designed by German educationalist [[Fritz Karsen]] and architect [[Leopold Rother]], both refugees from Nazi Germany. The construction began in 1935, under the government of [[Alfonso López Pumarejo]]. It is organized as an ellipse, divided into five parts, each containing one of the academic divisions and its respective dependencies. From an aerial view, a shape of an owl can be seen, emblematic of a deep connection with wisdom and intuitive knowledge. The buildings were constructed as prismatic blocks, and painted white, in order to give an austere and clean look.

Some landmarks in the campus are the [[León de Greiff]] Auditorium, and the ''Francisco de Paula Santander'' Plaza, also known unofficially as the "Central Plaza" or the "Ché Plaza", in honor of [[Che Guevara|Ernesto ''el Ché'' Guevara]].  The campus has its own [[Alfonso López Pumarejo Stadium|stadium]], where sometimes matches for the [[Colombian Professional Football]] are held.

===Medellín Branch===
{{Main|National University of Colombia at Medellín}}
The [[National University of Colombia at Medellín|National University of Colombia, Medellín]] has two campuses, the Central Campus and Campus Robledo, where 10,447 students study. This site provides approximately 29% of the seats for new students at National. Also this site has 555 faculty professors, of which 38% are doctors, 44% are master's, 8% were specialists and 10% are Professionals. This site offers 26 undergraduate and 73 graduate courses: 15 PhDs, 28 Masters, and 29 specializations. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Its history has given Medellín a peculiar character, since it was formed as most of their universities from the classical degrees of [[Law]], [[Medicine]], [[Arts]] and [[Sciences]]. The site grew out of engineering programs, which is why today, the Medellín has the highest number of engineering programs (17) among the campuses of the National University of Colombia and Colombia in general. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Central Campus: Located northwest of downtown, between Cerro Ecoparque the Flyer and the Medellín River. It is since 1938 the headquarters of the National University of Colombia in Medellin when the School of Tropical Agriculture (now the Faculty of Agricultural Sciences) joined the University. The Central Campus has an area of 272,982 m², the heart of Rio has an area of 31,758 m² and a portion of Cerro El Flying is around 269,257 m². Several learning centers can be found in at the campus including the Entomological Museum which was founded in 1937, the Museum of Mycology founded in 1987, the Herbarium "Gabriel Gutierrez," the wood collection, the Central Library "Efe Gomez" as an attractive artistic and architectural highlights, the Totem Mythic created by Master Pedro Nel Gomez, Block 41 declared a National Cultural, designed by Engineer Jesús Montoya Mejía which began in 1931, the Block 11 Master designed by Pedro Nel Gómez. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Campus Robledo Robledo, also called core or more colloquially as the School of Mines, is located northwest of the city of Medellin, Robledo neighborhood is composed of three fields separated by Kr 80, which presents a difficult high traffic pedestrian connection between the properties that make up the physical structure of the School of Mines, and Ingeominas, recently integrated into the University. It has an area of 100,978.69 m². In 1886, the School of Mines was created and it was incorporated with the University in 1936, which is called today as the National School of Mines with approximately 3,500 students. It highlights the Museum of Geosciences, Maximum classroom buildings (block M5) and M3 block designed by Master Pedro Nel Gomez School of Mines in 1936. Declared National Monument in 1994 thanks to its architecture and its murals by the same Pedro Nel Gómez. The University in Medellin has 5 faculties of the schools offer 25 careers, nearly half of them are engineering at the School of Mines, also has three museums and other services. {{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

{{pp-move-indef}} 

The '''occult''' (from the [[Latin]] word ''occultus'' "clandestine, hidden, secret") is "knowledge of the hidden" or "knowledge of the [[paranormal]]", as opposed to [[fact]]s and "knowledge of the [[measurable]]", usually referred to as [[science]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Evelyn Underhill|Underhill, E.]] (1911). ''Mysticism,'' Meridian, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Crabb (writer)|Crabb, G.]] (1927). ''English synonyms explained, in alphabetical order, copious illustrations and examples drawn from the best writers.'' New York: Thomas Y. Crowell Co.&lt;/ref&gt; The term is sometimes taken to mean knowledge that "is meant only for certain people" or that "must be kept hidden", but for most practicing occultists it is simply the study of a deeper spiritual reality that [[Speculative reason|extends pure reason]] and the physical sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.P. Blavatsky|Blavatsky, H. P.]] (1888). ''The Secret Doctrine.'' Whitefish, MT: [[Kessinger Publishing]].&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''[[esotericism|esoteric]]'' and ''arcane'' can also be used to describe the occult,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The American Heritage College Thesaurus |year=2004 |location=Boston |publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin]] |page=530}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to their meanings unrelated to the supernatural. 

The term ''occult sciences'' was used in the 16th century to refer to [[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and natural [[Magic (supernatural)|magic]]. The term '''occultism''' emerged in 19th-century France, where it came to be associated with various French esoteric groups connected to [[Éliphas Lévi]] and [[Papus]], and in 1875 was introduced into the [[English language]] by the esotericist [[Helena Blavatsky]]. Throughout the 20th century, the term was used [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratically]] by a range of different authors, but by the 21st century was commonly employed – including by academic scholars of esotericism – to refer to a range of esoteric currents that developed in the mid-19th century and their descendants. ''Occultism'' is thus often used to categorise such esoteric traditions as [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], [[Anthroposophy]], the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and [[New Age]].

Particularly since the late twentieth century, various authors have used '''the occult''' as a substantivized adjective. In this usage, "the occult" is a category into which varied beliefs and practices are placed if they are considered to fit into neither [[religion]] nor [[science]]. "The occult" in this sense is very broad, encompassing such phenomenon as beliefs in [[vampires]] or [[fairies]] and movements like [[Ufology]] and [[parapsychology]]. In that same period, ''occult'' and ''[[culture]]'' were combined to form the [[neologism]] '''occulture'''. Initially used in the [[industrial music]] scene, it was later given scholarly applications.

==Occult sciences==

The idea of "occult sciences" developed in the sixteenth century.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} The term usually encompassed three practices—[[astrology]], [[alchemy]], and [[natural magic]]—although sometimes various forms of divination were also included rather than being subsumed under natural magic.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} These were grouped together because, according to the historian of religion [[Wouter Hanegraaff]], "each one of them engaged in systematic investigation of nature and natural processes, in the context of theoretical frameworks that relied heavily on a belief in occult qualities, virtues or forces."{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}
Although there are areas of overlap between these different occult sciences, they are separate and in some cases practitioners of one would reject the others as being illegitimate.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}

During the Enlightenment, the term "occult" increasingly came to be seen as intrinsically incompatible with the concept of "science".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} From that point on, use of the term "occult science(s)" implied a conscious polemic against mainstream science.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}}

In his 1871 book ''Primitive Culture'', the anthropologist [[Edward Tylor]] used the term "occult science" as a synonym for "[[magic (paranormal)|magic]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hanegraaff|first1=Wouter J.|title=Dictionary of Gnosis &amp; Western Esotericism|date=2006|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9789004152311|page=716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Occult qualities===
Occult qualities are properties that have no known rational explanation; in the [[Middle Ages]], for example, [[magnetism]] was considered an occult quality.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=jbLWJPca_zoC&amp;pg=PA185 Religion, Science, and Worldview: Essays in Honor of Richard S. Westfall], Margaret J. Osler, Paul Lawrence Farber, [[Cambridge University Press]], 2002, {{ISBN|0-521-52493-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Occult Qualities and the Experimental Philosophy: Active Principles in Pre-Newtonian Matter Theory|first=John|last=Henry|date=1 December 1986|journal=History of Science|volume=24|issue=4|pages=335–381|doi=10.1177/007327538602400401}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aether (classical element)]] is another such element.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=othGPNE56dMC&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=occult+science+aether#v=onepage&amp;q=+aether&amp;f=false|title=Spirituality and the Occult: From the Renaissance to the Modern Age|first1=B.

In ''Historical and Philosophical Perspectives of Science'' v. 5 (ed. Roger H. Stuewer)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occultism==

[[File:Eliphas Levi.jpg|thumb|right|The French esotericist Éliphas Lévi popularised the term "occultism" in the 1850s. His reinterpretation of traditional esoteric ideas has led to him being called the origin of "the occultist current properly so-called".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}]]

In the English-speaking world, prominent figures in the development of occultism included [[Helena Blavatsky]] and other figures associated with her [[Theosophical Society]], senior figures in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]] like [[William Wynn Westcott]] and [[Samuel Liddell Mathers]], as well as other individuals such as [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]], [[Emma Hardinge Britten]], [[Arthur Edward Waite]], and—in the early twentieth century—[[Aleister Crowley]], [[Dion Fortune]], and [[Israel Regardie]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}}
By the end of the nineteenth century, occultist ideas had also spread into other parts of Europe, such as Germany, [[Austria-Hungary]], and Italy.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|pp=1365–1366}}

Unlike older forms of esotericism, occultism does not reject "scientific progress or modernity".{{sfnm|1a1=Faivre|1y=1994|1p=88|2a1=Goodrick-Clarke|2y=2008|2p=196}} Lévi had stressed the need to solve the conflict between science and religion, something that he believed could be achieved by turning to what he thought was the ancient wisdom found in [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}}
The scholar of esotericism [[Antoine Faivre]] noted that rather than outright accepting "the triumph of scientism", occultists sought "an alternative solution", trying to integrate "scientific progress or modernity" with "a global vision that will serve to make the vacuousness of materialism more apparent".{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}} Hanegraaff remarked that occultism was "essentially an attempt to adapt esotericism" to the "[[disenchantment|disenchanted world]]", a post-Enlightenment society in which growing scientific discovery had eradicated the "dimension of irreducible mystery" previously present. In doing so, he noted, occultism distanced itself from the "traditional esotericism" which accepted the premise of an "enchanted" world.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=423}} According to historian of esotericism [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]], occultist groups typically seek "proofs and demonstrations by recourse to scientific tests or terminology".{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2008|p=196}} 

Another feature of these occultists is that—unlike earlier esotericists—they often openly distanced themselves from [[Christianity]], in some cases (like that of Crowley) even adopting explicitly anti-Christian stances.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} This reflected how pervasive the influence of [[secularisation]] had been on all areas of European society.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} In rejecting Christianity, these occultists sometimes turned towards pre-Christian belief systems and embraced forms of [[Modern Paganism]], while others instead took influence from the religions of Asia, such as [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. In various cases, certain occultists did both.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} Another characteristic of these occultists was the emphasis that they placed on "the spiritual realization of the individual", an idea that would strongly influence the twentieth-century [[New Age]] and [[Human Potential Movement]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}} This spiritual realization was encouraged both through traditional Western 'occult sciences' like alchemy and ceremonial magic, but by the start of the twentieth century had also begun to include practices drawn from non-Western contexts, such as [[yoga]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1366}}

Although occultism is distinguished from earlier forms of esotericism, many occultists have also been involved in older esoteric currents. For instance, occultists like [[François-Charles Barlet]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]] were also [[Theosophy (Boehmian)|theosophers]],{{efn|This theosophy, which is a Christian esoteric tradition adhered to by theosophers, is a distinct movement from Theosophy, the occultist religion adhered to by Theosophists, despite the shared name.}} adhering to the ideas of the early modern Christian thinker [[Jakob Bohme]], and seeking to integrate ideas from Bohmian theosophy and occultism.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=89}}

==Etymology==

The earliest known usage of the term "occultism" is in the [[French language]], as ''l'occultisme''. In this form it appears in A. de Lestrange's article on "Ésotérisme chrétien" that was published in [[Jean-Baptiste Richard de Randonvilliers]]' ''Dictionnaire des mots nouveaux'' ("Dictionary of new words") in 1842.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1364}} The French esotericist [[Éliphas Lévi]] then used the term in his influential book on [[ritual magic]], ''[[Dogme et rituel de la haute magie]]'', first published in 1856.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} His use of the term deliberately acknowledged earlier practices that, since the Renaissance, had been termed "occult sciences" or "occult philosophy".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}} It was from Lévi's usage of the term that it gained wider usage;{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2pp=1364–1365}} according to Faivre, Lévi was "the principal exponent of esotericism in Europe and the United States" at that time.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}

The earliest use of the term "occultism" in the [[English language]] appears to be in "A Few Questions to 'Hiraf'", an 1875 article published in the American Spiritualist magazine, ''[[Spiritual Scientist]]''. The article had been written by [[Helena Blavatsky]], a Russian émigré living in the United States who founded the religion of Theosophy.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1365}}

Various twentieth-century writers on the subject used the term "occultism" in different ways. Some writers, such as the German philosopher [[Theodor W. Adorno]] in his "Theses Against Occultism", employed the term as a broad synonym for [[irrationality]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}} In his 1950 book ''L'occultisme'', [[Robert Amadou]] used the term as a synonym for [[Western esotericism|esotericism]],{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1367}} an approach that the later scholar of esotericism Marco Pasi suggested left the term "superfluous".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}} Unlike Amadou, other writers saw "occultism" and "esotericism" as different, albeit related, phenomena. In the 1970s, the sociologist [[Edward Tiryakian]] distinguished between ''occultism'', which he used in reference to practices, techniques, and procedures, and ''esotericism'', which he defined as the religious or philosophical belief systems on which such practices are based.{{sfnm|1a1=Hanegraaff|1y=2006|1p=887|2a1=Pasi|2y=2006|2p=1367}} This division was initially adopted by the early academic scholar of esotericism, Antoine Faivre, although he later abandoned it;{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=887}} it has been rejected by most scholars who study esotericism.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1367}}

A different division was used by the [[Traditionalist school|Traditionalist]] author [[René Guénon]], who used ''esotericism'' to describe what he believed was the Traditionalist, inner teaching at the heart of most religions, while ''occultism'' was used pejoratively to describe new religions and movements that he disapproved of, such as [[Spiritualism]], [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], and various [[secret societies]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|pp=887–888}} Guénon's use of this terminology was adopted by later writers like [[Serge Hutin]] and [[Luc Benoist]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} As noted by Hanegraaff, Guénon's use of these terms are rooted in his Traditionalist beliefs and "cannot be accepted as scholarly valid".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}

The term "occultism" derives from the older term "occult", much as the term "esotericism" derives from the older term "esoteric".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}} However, the historian of esotericism [[Wouter Hanegraaff]] stated that it was important to distinguish between the meanings of the term "occult" and "occultism".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=884}} Occultism is not a homogenous movement, and is widely diverse.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}}

Over the course of its history, the term "occultism" has been used in various different ways.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1364}} However, in contemporary uses, "occultism" commonly refers to forms of [[Western esotericism|esotericism]] that developed in the nineteenth century and their twentieth-century derivations.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} In a descriptive sense, it has been used to describe forms of esotericism which developed in nineteenth-century France, especially in the [[Martinism|Neo-Martinist]] environment.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} According to the historian of esotericism [[Antoine Faivre]], it is with the esotericist [[Éliphas Lévi]] that "the occultist current properly so-called" first appears.{{sfn|Faivre|1994|p=88}} Other prominent French esotericists involved in developing occultism included [[Papus]], [[Stanislas de Guaita]], [[Joséphin Péladan]], [[Georges-Albert Puyou de Pouvourville]], and [[Jean Bricaud]].{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1365}}

===Etic uses of the term===
{{See also|Emic and etic}}
[[File:Wouter Hanegraaff 2006 Alchemy Conference.jpg|thumb|right|In the 1990s, the Dutch scholar Wouter Hanegraaff put forward a new definition of "occultism" for scholarly uses]]

In the mid-1990s, a new definition of "occultism" was put forth by Hanegraaff.{{sfn|Pasi|2006|pp=1367–1368}} According to Hanegraaff, the term "occultism" can be used not only for the nineteenth-century groups which openly self-described using that term, but can also be used in reference to "the ''type'' of esotericism that they represent".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} 
Seeking to define "occultism" so that the term would be suitable "as an [[wikt:etic#Adjective|etic]] category" for scholars, Hanegraaff devised the following definition: "a category in the study of religions, which comprises ''all attempts by esotericists to come to terms with a disenchanted world or, alternatively, by people in general to make sense of esotericism from the perspective of a disenchanted secular world''".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=422}} Hanegraaff noted that this etic usage of the term would be independent of [[wikt:emic#Adjective|emic]] usages of the term employed by occultists and other esotericists themselves.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=422}} 

In this definition, "occultism" covers many esoteric currents that have developed from the mid-nineteenth century onward, including Spiritualism, Theosophy, the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], and the [[New Age]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} Employing this etic understanding of "occultism", Hanegraaff argued that its development could begin to be seen in the work of the Swedish esotericist [[Emanuel Swedenborg]] and in the [[Mesmerism|Mesmerist]] movement of the eighteenth century, although added that occultism only emerged in "fully-developed form" as Spiritualism, a movement that developed in the United States during the mid-nineteenth century.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|1996|p=423}}

Pasi suggested that the use of Hanegraaff's definition might cause confusion by presenting a group of nineteenth-century esotericists who called themselves "occultists" as just one part of a broader category of esotericists whom scholars would call "occultists".{{sfn|Pasi|2006|p=1368}}

===The Occult===

The term "occult" has also been used as a [[substantivized adjective]] as "the occult", a term that has been particularly widely used among journalists and [[sociology|sociologists]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} This term was popularised by the publication of [[Colin Wilson]]'s 1971 book ''The Occult''.{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}
This term has been used as an "intellectual waste-basket" into which a wide array of beliefs and practices have been placed because they do not fit readily into the categories of [[religion]] or [[science]].{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}} According to Hanegraaff, "the occult" is a category into which gets placed a range of beliefs from "spirits or fairies to parapsychological experiments, from UFO-abductions to Oriental mysticism, from vampire legends to channeling, and so on".{{sfn|Hanegraaff|2006|p=888}}

===Occulture===

The neologism "occulture" was used within the [[industrial music]] scene of the late twentieth century, and was probably coined by one of its central figures, the musician and occultist [[Genesis P-Orridge]].{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=124}}
It was in this scene that the scholar of religion Christopher Partridge encountered the term.{{sfn|Partridge|2013|p=124}}
Partridge used the term in an academic sense. He stated that occulture was "the new spiritual environment in the West; the reservoir feeding new spiritual springs; the soil in which new spiritualities are growing".{{sfn|Partridge|2004|p=4}}

'''Palynology''' is the "study of dust" (from {{lang-grc-gre|παλύνω|palunō}}, "strew, sprinkle"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dpalu%2Fnw παλύνω], 
Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[-logy]]'') or "particles that are strewn". A classic palynologist analyses [[particulate]] samples collected from the air, from water, or from deposits including sediments of any age. The condition and identification of those particles, organic and inorganic, give the palynologist clues to the life, environment, and energetic conditions that produced them.

The term is sometimes narrowly used to refer to a subset of the discipline, which is defined as "the study of microscopic objects of macromolecular organic composition (i.e., compounds of carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen), not capable of dissolution in hydrochloric or hydrofluoric acids".&lt;ref&gt;W.A.S.

===Early history===
The earliest reported observations of pollen under a microscope are likely to have been in the 1640s by the English [[botanist]] [[Nehemiah Grew]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Bradbury| first=S.| date=1967| title=The Evolution of the Microscope| publisher=Pergamon Press| place=New York| pages=375 p}}&lt;/ref&gt; who described pollen and the stamen, and concluded that pollen is required for sexual reproduction in flowering plants.

By the late 1870s, as optical microscopes improved and the principles of [[stratigraphy]] were worked out, [[Robert Kidston]] and [[P. Reinsch]] were able to examine the presence of fossil spores in the Devonian and Carboniferous coal seams and make comparisons between the living spores and the ancient fossil spores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Jansonius| first=J.| author2=D.C. McGregor| date=1996| title=Introduction, Palynology: Principles and Applications| journal=AASP Foundation| volume=1| pages=1–10| url=http://www.palynology.org/history/jansonmcgrgrhist.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070709194314/http://www.palynology.org/history/jansonmcgrgrhist.html| archivedate=2007-07-09| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early investigators include [[Christian Gottfried Ehrenberg]] ([[radiolarian]]s, [[diatoms]] and [[dinoflagellate cysts]]), [[Gideon Mantell]] ([[desmid]]s) and [[Henry Hopley White]] (dinoflagellate cysts).

=== 1890s to 1940s===
Quantitative analysis of pollen began with [[Lennart von Post]]'s published work.&lt;ref&gt;Traverse, Alfred and Sullivan, Herbert J. "The Background, Origin, and Early History of the American Association of Stratigraphic Palynologists" Palynology 7: 7-18 (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Although he published in the Swedish language, his methodology gained a wide audience through his lectures. In particular, his [[Kristiania]] lecture of 1916 was important in gaining a wider audience.&lt;ref name="FIPol"&gt;{{cite book| last=Fægri| first=Knut| authorlink=Knut Fægri| author2=Johs.

Gunnar E. Erdtman| journal=Pollen et Spores| date=1973| volume=15| pages=5–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The isolation ended with the German publication of [[Gunnar Erdtman]]'s 1921 thesis. The methodology of pollen analysis became widespread throughout [[Europe]] and [[North America]] and revolutionized [[Quaternary]] vegetation and climate change research.&lt;ref name="FIPol" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;von Post, L (1918) "Skogsträdpollen i sydsvenska torvmosslagerföljder", Forhandlinger ved de Skandinaviske naturforskeres 16. møte i Kristiania 1916: p. 433&lt;/ref&gt;

Earlier pollen researchers include Früh (1885),&lt;ref&gt;Früh, J (1885) "Kritische Beiträge zur Kenntnis des Torfes", Jahrb.k.k.Geol.Reichsanstalt 35&lt;/ref&gt; who enumerated many common tree pollen types, and a considerable number of [[spore]]s and [[herb]] pollen grains. There is a study of pollen samples taken from sediments of Swedish lakes by Trybom (1888);&lt;ref&gt;Trybom, F (1888) "Bottenprof fran svenska insjöar", Geol.Foren.Forhandl.10&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pinus|pine]] and [[Picea|spruce]] pollen was found in such profusion that he considered them to be serviceable as "[[index fossils]]". [[Georg F. L. Sarauw]] studied fossil pollen of middle Pleistocene age ([[Cromerian]]) from the harbour of [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Sarauw | first=G. F.

Weber 1918) appear to be among the first to undertake 'percentage frequency' calculations.

=== 1940s to 1989===

The term ''palynology'' was introduced by Hyde and Williams in 1944, following correspondence with the Swedish [[geologist]] [[Ernst Antevs]], in the pages of the ''[[Pollen Analysis Circular]]'' (one of the first journals devoted to pollen analysis, produced by [[Paul Sears]] in North America). Hyde and Williams chose ''palynology'' on the basis of the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words ''paluno'' meaning 'to sprinkle' and ''pale'' meaning 'dust' (and thus similar to the [[Latin]] word ''pollen'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Hyde| first=H.A.| author2=D.A. Williams| url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| title=The Right Word| journal=Pollen Analysis Circular| volume=8| pages=6| date=1944| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070618031355/http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/riteword.html| archivedate=2007-06-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollen analysis in North America stemmed from [[Phyllis Draper]], an MS student under Sears at the University of Oklahoma. During her time as a student, she developed the first pollen diagram from a sample that depicted the percentage of several species at different depths at Curtis Bog. This was the introduction of pollen analysis in North America&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Draper|first=Phyllis|date=|title=A DEMONSTRATION OF THE TECHNIQUE OF POLLEN ANALYSIS|url=http://ojs.library.okstate.edu/osu/index.php/OAS/article/viewFile/2553/2251|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;; pollen diagrams today still often remain in the same format with depth on the y-axis and abundances of species on the x-axis.

=== 1990s to the 21st century ===
Pollen analysis advanced rapidly in this period due to advances in optics and computers. Much of the science was revised by [[Johannes Iversen]] and [[Knut Fægri]] in their textbook on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Fægri, K. &amp; Iversen, J. (1989) ''Textbook of pollen analysis''. 4th ed. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Chichester. 328 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods of studying palynomorphs ==

===Palynomorphs===
Palynomorphs are broadly defined as organic-walled [[microfossil]]s between 5 and 500 [[micrometre]]s in size.  They are extracted from [[sedimentary rock]]s and [[pollen core|sediment cores]] both physically, by ultrasonic treatment and [[sieve analysis|wet sieving]], and chemically, by chemical digestion to remove the non-organic fraction. Palynomorphs may be composed of organic material such as [[chitin]], [[pseudochitin]] and [[sporopollenin]]. Palynomorphs that have a taxonomy description are sometimes referred to as palynotaxa.

Palynomorphs form a [[geological]] record of importance in determining the type of [[prehistoric life]] that existed at the time the sedimentary formation was laid down. As a result, these microfossils give important clues to the prevailing [[paleogeography|climatic conditions]] of the time. Their paleontological utility derives from an abundance numbering in millions of [[Cell (biology)|cells]] per gram in organic marine deposits, even when such deposits are generally not [[fossiliferous]]. Palynomorphs, however, generally have been destroyed in [[Metamorphic rock|metamorphic]] or recrystallized rocks.

Typically, palynomorphs are [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[acritarch]]s, [[spore]]s, [[pollen]], [[fungi]], [[scolecodonts]] (scleroprotein teeth, jaws and associated features of [[polychaeta|polychaete]] [[annelid]] worms), [[arthropod]] organs (such as [[insect]] mouthparts), [[chitinozoa]]ns and [[foram|microforam]]s. Palynomorph microscopic structures that are abundant in most sediments are resistant to routine pollen extraction including strong acids and bases, and acetolysis, or density separation.&lt;!--Check this sentence, before I copy/edit-ted it. It had GROSS errors.--&gt;

==Palynofacies==
A '''palynofacies''' is the complete assemblage of [[organic matter]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in a fossil deposit. The study of the palynofacies of a  [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] of sediments can be used to learn about the depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]]. The term ''palynofacies'' was introduced by the French [[geologist]] [[André Combaz]] in 1964. Palynofacies studies are often linked to investigations of the palynology and organic [[geochemistry]] of [[sedimentary rock]]s.

Palynofacies can be used in two ways:
* [[Organic matter|Organic]] palynofacies considers all the acid insoluble [[particulate organic matter]] (POM), including [[kerogen]] and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s in sediments and palynological preparations of sedimentary rocks. The sieved or unsieved preparations may be examined using [[strew mount]]s on microscope slides that may be examined using a transmitted light biological microscope or [[ultraviolet]] (UV) fluorescence microscope. The abundance, composition and preservation of the various components, together with the thermal alteration of the organic matter is considered.
* Palynomorph palynofacies considers the abundance, composition and diversity of palynomorphs in a sieved palynological preparation of sediments or palynological preparation of [[sedimentary rock]]s. The ratio of [[ocean|marine]] [[fossil]] [[phytoplankton]] ([[acritarchs]] and [[dinoflagellate]] cysts), together with [[chitinozoa]]ns, to terrestrial palynomorphs ([[pollen]] and [[spores]]) can be used to derive a terrestrial input index in marine sediments.

Both types of palynofacies studies are used for [[geology|geological interpretation]] of [[sedimentary rock|sedimentary]] basins in exploration geology, often in conjunction with palynological analysis and [[vitrinite]] reflectance.

===Chemical preparation===
Chemical digestion follows a number of steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially the only chemical treatment used by researchers was treatment with [[Potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) to remove [[Humic acid|humic]] substances; defloculation was accomplished through surface treatment or ultra-sonic treatment, although sonification may cause the pollen exine to rupture.&lt;ref name="InMem" /&gt; The use of [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF) to digest [[silicate]] [[mineral]]s was introduced by Assarson and Granlund in 1924, greatly reducing the amount of time required to scan slides for palynomorphs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Palynological studies using peats presented a particular challenge because of the presence of well-preserved organic material, including fine rootlets, moss leaflets and organic litter. This was the last major challenge in the chemical preparation of materials for palynological study. [[Acetolysis]] was developed by Gunnar Erdtman and his brother to remove these fine cellulose materials by dissolving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| volume=28
| pages=354–358}}&lt;/ref&gt; In acetolysis the specimen is treated with [[acetic anhydride]] and [[sulfuric acid]], dissolving [[cellulose|cellulistic]] materials and thus providing better visibility for palynomorphs.

Some steps of the chemical treatments require special care for safety reasons, in particular the use of HF which diffuses very fast through the skin and, causes severe chemical burns, and can be fatal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Another treatment includes kerosene flotation for [[chitin]]ous materials.

===Analysis===
Once samples have been prepared chemically, they are mounted on [[microscope]] slides using silicon oil, glycerol or glycerol-jelly and examined using light [[microscopy]] or mounted on a stub for [[Scanning electron microscope|scanning electron microscopy]].

Researchers will often study either modern samples from a number of unique sites within a given area, or samples from a single site with a record through time, such as samples obtained from [[peat]] or lake sediments. More recent studies have used the modern analog technique in which paleo-samples are compared to modern samples for which the parent vegetation is known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

When the slides are observed under a microscope, the researcher counts the number of grains of each pollen taxon.  This record is next used to produce a [[pollen diagram]]. These data can be used to detect [[human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] effects, such as logging,&lt;ref&gt;

Palynology can be applied to problems in many fields including [[geology]], [[botany]], [[paleontology]], [[archaeology]], [[pedology (soil study)]], and [[physical geography]].

== Applications ==
Palynology is used for a diverse range of applications, related to many scientific disciplines:

* [[Biostratigraphy]] and [[geochronology]]. Geologists use palynological studies in biostratigraphy to correlate [[stratum|strata]] and determine the relative age of a given bed, horizon, formation or [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical]] sequence.
* [[paleoecology|Palaeoecology]] and [[climate change]]. Palynology can be used to reconstruct past [[vegetation]] (land plants) and [[ocean|marine]] and [[Freshwater phytoplankton]] communities, and so infer past [[natural environment|environmental]] ([[paleoenvironment|palaeoenvironment]]al) and [[paleoclimatology|palaeoclimatic]] conditions.
* [[organic compound|Organic]] [[palynofacies]] studies, which examine the preservation of the particulate organic matter and [[#Palynomorphs|palynomorph]]s provides information on the depositional environment of sediments and depositional palaeoenvironments of [[sedimentary|sedimentary rocks]].
* [[Geothermal]] alteration studies examine the [[color|colour]] of palynomorphs extracted from rocks to give the thermal alteration and [[hydrocarbon|maturation]] of [[sedimentary]] sequences, which provides estimates of maximum [[paleotemperatures|palaeotemperatures]].
* [[Limnology]] studies. Freshwater palynomorphs and animal and plant fragments, including the [[prasinophyte]]s and [[desmid]]s ([[green alga]]e) can be used to study past lake levels and long term [[climate change]].
* [[scientific classification|Taxonomy]] and [[evolution|evolutionary studies]]. Involving the use of pollen morphological characters as source of taxonomic data to delimit plant species under same family or genus. Pollen apertural status is frequently used for differential sorting or finding similarities between species of the same taxa. This is also called Palynotaxonomy.
* [[Forensic palynology]]: the study of [[pollen]] and other palynomorphs for evidence at a crime scene.
* [[Allergy]] studies. Studies of the geographic distribution and seasonal production of pollen, can help sufferers of allergies such as [[hay fever]].
* [[Melissopalynology]]: the study of pollen and spores found in honey.
* [[Archaeological]] palynology examines human uses of plants in the past. This can help determine seasonality of site occupation, presence or absence of agricultural practices or products, and 'plant-related activity areas' within an archaeological context.  [[Bonfire Shelter]] is one such example of this application.

Because the distribution of [[acritarchs]], [[chitinozoa]]ns, [[dinoflagellate cysts]], [[pollen]] and [[spore]]s provides evidence of [[stratigraphy|stratigraphical correlation]] through [[biostratigraphy]] and [[palaeoenvironment]]al reconstruction, one common and lucrative application of palynology is in [[petroleum|oil]] and [[Natural gas|gas]] exploration.

Palynology also allows scientists to infer the climatic conditions from the vegetation present in an area [[geologic timescale|thousands or millions of years]] ago. This is a fundamental part of research into [[climate change]].

'''Raimon Panikkar Alemany''', also known as '''Raimundo Panikkar''' and '''Raymond Panikkar'''&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|title=Biodata|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20100829081848/http://www.lavanguardia.es/lv24h/20100826/53990452372.html|archivedate=2010-08-29|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; (November 2, 1918 &amp;ndash; August 26, 2010), was a Catalan [[Roman Catholic]] priest and a proponent of [[Interfaith dialogue|inter-religious dialogue]]. As a scholar, he specialized in [[comparative religion]].

==Early life and education==
Raimon Panikkar was born as the son of a Spanish [[Roman Catholic]] mother and a [[Hindu]] [[India]]n father in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{citejournal|work=Time|date=September 20, 2010|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was well-educated and from the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] bourgeoisie. His father, Ramunni Panikkar, belonged to  [[Malabar district|Malabar]] [[Nair]] family from [[South India]]. Panikkar's father was a freedom fighter during [[British Raj|British colonial rule in India]] and escaped from Britain and married into a Catalan family. Panikkar's father studied in England and was the representative of a German chemical company in Barcelona. {{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

Educated at a [[Jesuit]] school, Panikkar studied chemistry and philosophy at the universities of [[University of Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[University of Bonn|Bonn]] and [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid]], and Catholic Theology in Madrid and Rome. He earned a doctorate in philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]] in 1946 and a doctorate in chemistry in 1958.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{citejournal|work=The New York Times|date=September 6, 2010|page=A20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a third doctorate in theology at the [[Pontifical Lateran University]] in Rome in 1961.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; He compared St. Thomas Aquinas's Philosophy with the eighth-century Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara|Ādi Śańkara]]'s Interpretation of the [[Brahma Sutras]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

==Career==

In 1946 he was ordained a [[Catholic priest]], and became a professor of philosophy at the [[Complutense University of Madrid|University of Madrid]].&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;

He made his first trip to India in 1954 where he studied [[Indian philosophy]] and religion at the [[University of Mysore]] and [[Banaras Hindu University]], where he met several Western monks seeking Eastern forms for the expression of their Christian beliefs.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; "I left Europe [for India] as a Christian, I discovered I was a Hindu and returned as a Buddhist without ever having ceased to be Christian," he later wrote.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="time" /&gt;

While in Jerusalem during 1962, he was summoned to Rome by Opus Dei founder and director, [[Saint]] [[Josemaría Escrivá]], who expelled him after a brief trial where he was charged with disobedience to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Raimon Panikkar |author= Raffaele Luise |id= San Paolo |place= Milan |year=2011 |pages= 25-32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966 he became a visiting professor at [[Harvard Divinity School]] and a professor of religious studies at [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] in 1972.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; For many years he taught in the spring and spent the rest of the year doing research in India.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; Where the typical approach to Cross-Cultural Religious Studies, especially in a secular university, was to hold two or more traditions at arm's length and draw lines of comparison between them, Panikkar's approach was to view issues in the real world through the eyes of two or more traditions.

In 1987 he moved to [[Tavertet]] in [[Catalonia]], in the hills north of Barcelona, where he founded the Raimon Panikkar Vivarium Foundation, a center for intercultural studies.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; 
In 2005 he creates Arbor &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moneyhouse registration|url=http://www.moneyhouse.ch/en/p/panikkar_alemany_raimon-4995690/|website=Moneyhouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the realization of his principle of interreligious collaboration for the relief of poverty in thousands of villages of India &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Arbor Foundation India|url=https://www.arborindia.org|website=Arbor India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panikkar authored more than 40 books and 900 articles. His complete works are being published in Italian. His 1989 [[Gifford Lectures]] were published in English by Orbis in 2009 under the title "The Rhythm of Being."

In a statement from his residence in Tavertet dated January 26, 2010, he wrote: "Dear Friends . . . I would like to communicate with you that I believe the moment has come, (put off time and again), to withdraw from all public activity, both the direct and the intellectual participation, to which I have dedicated all my life as a way of sharing my reflections.  I will continue to be close to you in a deeper way, through silence and prayer, and in the same way I would ask you to be close to me in this last period of my existence.  You have often heard me say that a person is a knot in a network of relationships; in taking my leave from you I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for having enriched me with the relationship I have had with each of you.  I am also grateful to all of those who, either in person or through association, continue working to spread my message and the sharing of my ideals, even without me.  Thankful for the gift of life which is only such if lived in communion with others: it is with this spirit that I have lived out my ministry."

'''Seattle Pacific University''' ('''SPU''') is a private liberal arts university in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], founded in 1891 in conjunction with the Oregon and Washington Conference of the [[Free Methodist Church]] as the Seattle Seminary. It became the Seattle Seminary and College in 1913, adopting the name Seattle Pacific College in 1915, and took its present moniker in 1977. Seattle Pacific University is a member of the [[Christian College Consortium]].

==History==

Seattle Pacific University was founded in 1891 by Free Methodist pioneers to train missionaries for overseas service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://spu.edu/about-spu/our-history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2014, a shooting occurred in Otto Miller Hall in which one student was killed and two other students were injured. The suspect was not a student at the school and had no connection to the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paul Lee: a young man with ‘infectious positive attitude’|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/localnews/2023788281_spulee1xml.html|newspaper=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gunman was stopped by student Jon Meis, who used pepper spray to disarm the gunman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.king5.com/article/news/local/court-releases-video-from-spu-shooting-showing-students-heroic-actions/244202869|title=Court releases video from SPU shooting showing student's heroic actions|work=KING|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meis received a Citizen Honors award from the [[Congressional Medal of Honor Society of the United States of America|Congressional Medal of Honor Society]] in 2015 for his work in stopping the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://q13fox.com/2015/03/25/2-washington-residents-including-spu-shooting-hero-honored-by-congressional-medal-of-honor-society/|title=2 Washington residents, including SPU shooting hero, honored by Congressional Medal of Honor Society|date=2015-03-26|work=Q13 FOX News|access-date=2018-06-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 16, 2016, the gunman was convicted in the shooting&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattle.cbslocal.com/2016/11/16/jury-convicts-man-in-fatal-shooting-at-seattle-university/|title=Man Found Guilty In Fatal Shooting At Seattle University|work=CBS Seattle|date=November 16, 2016|accessdate=November 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sentenced to 112 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/crime/aaron-ybarra-sentenced-to-112-years-for-deadly-shooting-at-seattle-pacific-university/|title=Aaron Ybarra sentenced to 112 years for deadly shooting at Seattle Pacific University|work=The Seattle Times|date=February 17, 2017|accessdate=February 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seattle Pacific is tied for 151st in the 2018 ''U.S. News and World Report''{{'s}} Best National Universities rankings; it is the only private university in the Pacific Northwest to make that list, and the only [[Christian College Consortium]] member to be ranked a Best National University.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/seattle-pacific-university-3788|title=Seattle Pacific University - U.S. News Best Colleges Rankings|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318083945/https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/seattle-pacific-university-3788|archive-date=2017-03-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SPU joins the [[University of Washington]] and [[Washington State University]] as the only three institutions from Washington state named to the magazine’s list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spu.edu/about-spu/news/articles/2016/oct/best-national-univ-usnwr-hero-image|title=A "Best National University"  - Seattle Pacific University|website=spu.edu|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honors program===
SPU offers a four-year alternate series of [[Curriculum#United States 2|general education]] classes for honors students called University Scholars that revolves around a [[Great Books]] reading list and the writing of a lengthy senior dissertation [http://spu.edu/academics/university-scholars/honors-projects]. Along with literature classes, the curriculum includes two Faith &amp; Science classes and a Christianity &amp; Scholarship class. The work load is generally very rigorous.

A student in the program will take his or her sequence of University Scholars courses with the same cohort of 40 students for the entire four years. A student may be admitted to the program regardless of major. Students apply in the spring of their senior year of college; a few students are invited into the program after their freshman year at SPU. There are no University Scholars classes scheduled for the fall of their junior year, in order to give students the opportunity to study abroad&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= University Scholars - Seattle Pacific University|url = http://spu.edu/academics/university-scholars |website= spu.edu |accessdate= 2015-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[File:SPU Campus.jpg|thumb|SPU Tiffany Loop]]
The university sits on a 43-acre campus at the northern end of [[Queen Anne, Seattle|Queen Anne Hill]], near the [[Fremont, Seattle, Washington|Fremont]] neighborhood and approximately four miles north of downtown Seattle. Many of the trees on the campus' central Tiffany Loop are among the oldest in the city. SPU also owns and operates two [[satellite]] campuses: a wilderness field station specializing in [[biology]] on [[Blakely Island]] in the [[San Juan Islands]] and Camp Casey, a former US military [[fort]] re-purposed as a conference and [[retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] facility on [[Whidbey Island]]. Notable buildings on the Seattle campus include:

===Alexander Hall===
[[File:Seattle Pacific University Alexander Hall 04.jpg|thumb|Alexander Hall]]
[[File:Seattle Pacific University McKinley Theater 01.jpg|thumb|McKinley Theater]]
Named for the first president of Seattle Pacific University, Alexander Beers, this four-story brick building is home to the School of Theology. The founder's first name, Alexander, was used, as the board did not want a building on campus called "Beers Hall." The building also houses the Sociology and History departments within the College of Arts and Sciences. Alexander Hall is the oldest building on campus, and at the time of the University's founding was the only building on campus. A $6.2-million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alexander Hall Campaign|url=http://spu.edu/give-to-spu/alexander|accessdate=June 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; seismic retrofitting and renovation of the interior office space and chapel was completed in 2014. Next door to Alexander is the main performing arts space on campus, the McKinley Theater.

===Demaray Hall/Clocktower===
Demaray Hall is the central academic building at Seattle Pacific University, housing numerous classrooms as well as the Office of Undergraduate Admissions, Student Academic Services and Student Financial Services. Administrative offices, including the offices of the president and provost, are also located in Demaray.  The building is named for Calvin Dorr Demaray, president of SPU from 1959-1968 and pastor of First Free Methodist Church, from 1948 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcdermott|first=Terry|title=C. Dorr Demaray, 91; College Expanded During His Presidency|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19921104&amp;slug=1522615|accessdate=March 25, 2013|newspaper=Seattle Times|date=November 4, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The clocktower in front of Demaray Hall was given to Seattle Pacific University by the class of 1966. It displays a bas-relief sculpture designed by former Professor of Art Ernst Schwidder, titled "Science, Religion and Humanities," which was brought to fruition by former Professor of Art Larry Metcalf and three of his students. The cast-stone relief panels depict various areas of study: the physical sciences, social sciences and humanities. Its symbols are drawn from American Pima, Arabic, Aztec, Babylonian, Egyptian and Greek cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPU Arts Guide|url=http://www.spu.edu/news/artsguide/artsGuide.asp?id=15|accessdate=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.spu.edu/archives_publications_spc/1/ "Demaray Hall Pamphlet" by Seattle Pacific College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gwinn Commons===
[[File:Spu gwinn.jpg|thumb|right|Gwinn Commons]]
Gwinn Commons is home to three different points of interest. The Crossroads at Gwinn Commons is the main dining hall on campus. Upstairs is the university's main, multi-use location. A pair of large rooms, the Queen Anne Room (named after the neighborhood in which SPU is located) and the Cascade Room (named after the [[Cascade Range|mountain range]] that can be seen from Upper Gwinn Commons) can each hold up to 500 people. Multiple functions are held in Upper Gwinn, ranging from Group (a Wednesday night worship service), admissions events, lectures, board meetings and more. The President's Dining room is also located here. In addition, there is the Corner Place Market, or C-Store, which holds Cocina Del Sol and also a market where students can purchase various daily necessities. Wells Gwinn, for whom the dining facility is named, served 32 years on the Seattle Pacific Board of Trustees.

=== Ames Library===
[[File:Seattle Pacific University Library.jpg|thumb|Ames Library (View from Lower Campus)]]
The Ames Library was completed in 1994. Housing over 250,000 volumes and 1,300 print [[periodicals]], it grows by 6,000 new titles a year. Students, faculty, and alumni have access to the collections of Summit and the [[Orbis Cascade Alliance]], comprising over 30 million items held in [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Oregon]] academic [[library|libraries]], including the [[University of Washington]]. In addition to printed [[reference]] materials, the library also has access to myriad [[computer file|electronic]] databases including JSTOR, ProQuest Direct, EBSCOHost, First Search, and others. Access is available to the university community via login both on and off campus.
[[File:Seattle Pacific Ames Library.jpg|thumb|Ames Library (View from Upper Campus)]]

===Peterson Hall===
[[File:Seattle Pacific University Peterson Hall 01.jpg|thumb|Peterson Hall]]
Peterson Hall is the second-oldest building on campus and houses the School of Education as well as the Department of Family and Consumer Sciences. In the basement is a food lab, as well as a sewing lab. Each month, SPU's food lab plays host to a Community Kitchen - an outreach to the city's homeless population wherein these individuals join with members of the university community in cooking and sharing a common meal.

===Student Union Building===
The Student Union Building (commonly known as the "SUB") was built in the 1960s and still serves as a central point where many students gather. On the first floor is the Pacific Collegium, a hub for commuter students. Dining options provided by the on campus dining services can also be found in the SUB. UNICOM, a student-run information desk assists with ticket sales, bus passes, pool passes, among other general information items. ASSP, the student government of SPU has its offices in the SUB along with STUB, the student event programming organization.

===Philip W. and Sharon K. Eaton Hall===
SPU's main hard sciences facility houses biology, chemistry and some psychology labs. Built in 2003, it is the most advanced building on campus, complete with an electron microscope, cold room, fully contained greenhouse and LEED Certification. This building is central to those students in the Pre-Professional Health Sciences programs. SPU's pre-med track has become widely known for its annual 90–100% acceptance into medical schools following graduation. On May 23, 2012, the SPU Board of Trustees announced that it named the building in honor of past SPU president Philip W.Eaton and his wife, Sharon.

=== McKenna Hall ===
[[File:Seattle Pacific McKenna Hall.jpg|thumb|McKenna Hall]]
The School of Business, Government, and Economics (SBGE) is located in McKenna Hall. In addition to undergraduate degrees in Management, Accounting, Economics, Political Science, and Global Development Studies - SBGE also offers three graduate level degrees: Master of Business Administration, Master of Science in Information Management, and a Master of Arts in Management. SBGE is home to the Center for Applied Learning and the Center for Integrity in Business which examines the intersections of theology and contemporary business.

===Residences===
Seattle Pacific University has five [[residence hall]]s. The university offers other on-campus [[House|residence]] options, such as the Cremona and Wesley apartments, and other small suite- or apartment-style living facilities for continuing students. All residence halls feature single-gender floors. The five residence halls are Ashton Hall, Hillsong Hall, Moyer Hall, Emerson Hall, and Arnett Hall.

Freshmen are required to live on campus in the residence halls unless they are living with family. Meal plans are required for all students living in the dorms. Students may leave campus housing when they are 20&amp;nbsp;years old, have junior class status, have petitioned and been approved to live off campus by Campus Housing, or are graduate students.
[[File:Seattle Pacific University 05A.jpg|thumb|SPU Main Gate]]
'''Arnett Hall''' welcomed its inaugural residents in Autumn 2014. As SPU's second smallest dorm with only four resident floors, it features suite-style single, double, and triple rooms, a main lounge on the first floor, and a green roof and roof deck on the fifth floor. Rooms on the upper floors may also feature views of the Lake Washington Ship Canal. It is located in the northwest corner of campus, just across the street from Demaray Hall and just down the hillsong from Gwinn Commons, SPU's dining hall.

'''Ashton Hall''', opened in 1965, is SPU's largest [[residence hall]] with more than 400&amp;nbsp;students on 6&amp;nbsp;floors. It was named in honor of Philip F. Ashton, PhD, a psychology professor (1929–1971). The hall is located on the highest point of SPU's campus. Many rooms have views of the campus and the [[Lake Washington Ship Canal]]. Annual Ashton Pop events include the Ashton Cup lip-sync contest, the Ashton Art Show, and a formal ball. In previous years the ball has been held at the [[Space Needle]], on an [[Argosy Cruise]], and at Seattle's [[W Hotel]]. Ashton Hall is also home to the Orangemen of 6th West (6w), a notable floor on campus, who display their school spirit by attending men's basketball home games and some away games, leading cheers for the Falcons and occasionally against the referees and the other team.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Emerson1.jpg|thumb|left|Emerson Hall]] --&gt;
'''Emerson Hall''', opened in 2001, is the campus's second newest residence hall, featuring suite-style single, double, and triple rooms, card-access security, a main [[living room|lounge]] with gas fireplace and Northwest wood beams, and an exercise center. Emerson also has a "Bridges Program", which lets students participate in intentional programs and conversations related to global issues and cross-cultural relationships. Emerson events include a quarterly Coffee House, the Emerson Film Festival, and the Spring Banquet. The hall is named for the street on which it resides.

'''Hill Hall''', which opened in 1962, located in the upper middle of the campus just steps from Gwinn Commons and the SPU Library, is known as the "family" hall for its comfortable atmosphere. It features a newly updated main lounge, the REX athletic center,  and the Hill Hall "beach", a grassy area behind the hall popular for [[outdoor]] [[recreation]] and sunbathing. Hill Hall events include "Decade" Skate (a song-based skit competition), a retreat to Camp Casey, an annual [[ball]], and 6th Hill "Beach Bash." It is named for the Reuben Hill family who donated property to the school for its expansion.

'''Moyer Hall''', opened in 1953 and remodeled in 1983, is located in the center of the campus on the edge of Tiffany Loop. The smallest of the traditional residence halls, Moyer was named in honor of Jacob Moyer, PhD, professor of chemistry and dean (1925–46). The hall's annual events include a fall retreat, an ice-broomball game, a citywide [[scavenger hunt]], and an all-hall [[banquet]].  In the past, the ice-broomball game was played between residents of Moyer and Marston Hall (no longer used for housing).  This annual "Toilet Bowl" match featured as its trophy a urinal removed from Moyer during the 1983 remodel, which the losing hall was required to display prominently the year following their loss.  The 05–06 school year also introduced a new event called The Experience Moyer Project (EMP), which featured musical talent from the hall as well as a variety of other activities.

The university owns multiple additional residences including Bailey, Cremona, 37 West Dravus, Falcon, Wesley and other buildings known by address rather than name are owned and maintained by SPU. These apartments are closer to campus but provide a more independent-living situation. They provide a great aggregate living environment among students. The 35 and 34 West Cremona apartments were remodeled in 2008–09 and 2009–10, respectively, and the Wesley Apartments at Cremona and Dravus, as of the 2011–2012 academic year, are now owned and operated by SPU and include the offices of two of the Residence Life Coordinators. The school sold the Robbins apartments in 2012.

:&lt;small&gt;Redirected by decade:&lt;ref name=redir&gt;
   Early years are redirected by decade, combining 10 articles
   as one article (which lists each event, noting each year "16xx"):
   1690-1699 redirect to "[[1690s in architecture]]" and
   1680-1689 redirect to "[[1680s in architecture]]" or
   1450-1459 redirect to ''[[1450s in architecture]]'', etc.
   For the 14th century, each decade redirects to the overall century,
   so "[[1390s in architecture]]" redirects to the century
   article "[[14th century in architecture]]" and so on.

'''Translation''' is the communication of the [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] of a [[source language (translation)|source-language]] text by means of an [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalent]] [[target language (translation)|target-language]] text.&lt;ref&gt;''The Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Namit Bhatia, ed., 1992, pp. 1,051–54.&lt;/ref&gt;  The English language draws a [[terminology|terminological]] distinction (not all languages do) between ''translating'' (a written text) and ''interpreting'' (oral or sign-language communication between users of different languages); under this distinction, translation can begin only after the appearance of [[writing]] within a language community.

A translator always risks inadvertently introducing source-language [[word]]s, [[grammar]], or [[syntax]] into the target-language rendering. On the other hand, such "spill-overs" have sometimes imported useful source-language [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s that have enriched target languages.  Translators, including early translators of [[sacred text]]s, have helped shape the very languages into which they have translated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXVIII, no. 2, 1983, pp. 84-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the laboriousness of the translation process, since the 1940s efforts have been made, with varying degrees of success, to [[machine translation|automate translation]] or to [[computer-assisted translation|mechanically aid the human translator]].&lt;ref&gt;W.J. Hutchins, ''Early Years in Machine Translation: Memoirs and Biographies of Pioneers'', Amsterdam, John Benjamins, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, the rise of the [[Internet]] has fostered a [[world-wide market]] for [[translation services]] and has facilitated "[[language localization]]".&lt;ref&gt;M. Snell-Hornby, ''The Turns of Translation Studies: New Paradigms or Shifting Viewpoints?'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins, 2006, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Rosetta Stone BW.jpeg|thumb|115px|left|[[Rosetta Stone]], a [[secular icon]] for the art of translation.&lt;ref&gt;"Rosetta Stone", ''The Columbia Encyclopedia'', 5th ed., 1994, p. 2,361.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[English language|English]] word "translation" derives from the [[Latin]] word ''translatio'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vélez|first1=Fabio|title=Antes de Babel|pages=3–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; which comes from ''[[Wiktionary:trans#Latin|trans]]'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:fero#Latin|ferre]]'', "to carry" or "to bring" (''-latio'' in turn coming from ''latus'', the [[past participle]] of ''ferre'').  Thus ''translatio'' is "a carrying across" or "a bringing across":  in this case, of a text from one language to another.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Germanic languages]] (except for modern [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) and some [[Slavic languages]] have [[calque#Loan translation: translatio and traductio|calque]]d their words for the [[concept]] of "translation" on ''translatio''.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Romance languages]] and the remaining ''Slavic'' languages have derived their words for the concept of "translation" from an alternative Latin word, ''traductio'', itself derived from ''traducere'' ("to lead across" or "to bring across", from ''trans'', "across" + ''[[Wiktionary:duco#Latin|ducere]]'', "to lead" or "to bring").&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;

The [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] term for "translation", {{lang|grc|μετάφρασις}} (''metaphrasis'', "a speaking across"), has supplied [[English language|English]] with "[[metaphrase]]" (a "[[literal translation|literal]]", or "word-for-word", translation)—as contrasted with "[[paraphrase]]" ("a saying in other words", from  {{lang|grc|παράφρασις}}, ''paraphrasis'').&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83" /&gt; "Metaphrase" corresponds, in one of the more recent terminologies, to "[[Translation#Equivalence|formal equivalence]]"; and "paraphrase", to "[[Translation#Equivalence|dynamic equivalence]]".&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;

Strictly speaking, the concept of metaphrase—of "word-for-word translation"—is an [[Perfection|imperfect]] concept, because a given word in a given language often carries more than one meaning; and because a similar given meaning may often be represented in a given language by more than one word.  Nevertheless, "metaphrase" and "paraphrase" may be useful as ''ideal'' concepts that mark the extremes in the spectrum of possible approaches to translation.{{efn|"Ideal concepts" are useful as well in other fields, such as [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], which include the concepts of perfectly solid bodies, perfectly rigid bodies, perfectly plastic bodies, perfectly black bodies, perfect crystals, perfect fluids, and perfect gases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'' (first published in Polish in 1976 as ''O doskonałości''); English translation by [[Christopher Kasparek]] subsequently serialized in 1979–1981 in ''Dialectics and Humanism:  The Polish Philosophical Quarterly'', and reprinted in [[Władysław Tatarkiewicz]], ''On Perfection'', Warsaw University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Theories==

===Western theory===
[[File:John Dryden by Sir Godfrey Kneller, Bt.jpg|thumb|125px|[[John Dryden]]]]
Discussions of the theory and practice of translation reach back into [[ancient history|antiquity]] and show remarkable continuities. The [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greeks]] distinguished between ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation]]) and ''[[paraphrase]]''. This distinction was adopted by English [[poet]] and [[translator]] [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), who described translation as the judicious blending of these two modes of phrasing when selecting, in the target language, "counterparts," or [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]], for the expressions used in the source language:

{{blockquote|When [words] appear... literally graceful, it were an injury to the author that they should be changed. But since... what is beautiful in one [language] is often barbarous, nay sometimes nonsense, in another, it would be unreasonable to limit a translator to the narrow compass of his author's words: 'tis enough if he choose out some expression which does not vitiate the sense.&lt;ref name="The Translator p. 83"/&gt;}}

[[File:Cicero - Musei Capitolini.JPG|thumb|left|125px|[[Cicero]]]]
Dryden cautioned, however, against the license of "imitation", i.e., of adapted translation: "When a painter copies from the life... he has no privilege to alter features and lineaments..."&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

This general formulation of the central concept of translation—[[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalence]]—is as adequate as any that has been proposed since [[Cicero]] and [[Horace]], who, in 1st-century-BCE [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], famously and literally cautioned against translating "word for word" ({{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}).&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

Despite occasional theoretical diversity, the actual ''practice'' of translation has hardly changed since [[ancient history|antiquity]]. Except for some extreme [[metaphrase]]rs in the early [[Christian]] period and the [[Middle Ages]], and adapters in various periods (especially pre-Classical Rome, and the 18th century), translators have generally shown prudent flexibility in seeking [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]]—"[[literal translation|literal]]" where possible, [[paraphrase|paraphrastic]] where necessary—for the original [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] and other crucial "values" (e.g., [[Style (fiction)|style]], [[verse form]], concordance with [[music]]al accompaniment or, in [[film]]s, with speech [[Manner of articulation|articulatory]] movements) as determined from context.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;

[[File:Samuel Johnson by Joshua Reynolds 2.png|thumb|100px|[[Samuel Johnson]]]]
In general, translators have sought to preserve the [[Context (language use)|context]] itself by reproducing the original order of [[sememe]]s, and hence [[word order]]—when necessary, reinterpreting the actual [[grammar|grammatical]] structure, for example, by shifting from [[active voice|active]] to [[passive voice]], or ''vice versa''. The grammatical differences between "fixed-word-order" [[language]]s&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[analytic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]]) and "free-word-order" languages&lt;ref&gt;Typically, [[synthetic language]]s.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g., [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Latin]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Russian language|Russian]]) have been no impediment in this regard.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  The particular [[syntax]] (sentence-structure) characteristics of a text's source language are adjusted to the syntactic requirements of the target language. 
[[File:Martin Luther, 1529.jpg|thumb|left|110px|[[Martin Luther]]]]
When a target language has lacked [[terminology|terms]] that are found in a source language, translators have borrowed those terms, thereby enriching the target language. Thanks in great measure to the exchange of [[calque]]s and [[loanword]]s between languages, and to their importation from other languages, there are few [[concept]]s that are "[[untranslatability|untranslatable]]" among the modern European languages.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 84"/&gt;  A greater problem, however, is translating terms relating to cultural concepts that have no equivalent in the target language.&lt;ref&gt;Some examples of this are described in the article, [http://www.noproblem.no/translate.html "Translating the 17th of May into English and other horror stories"], retrieved 2010-04-15.&lt;/ref&gt;  For full comprehension, such situations require the provision of a [[gloss (annotation)#In linguistics|gloss]].

Generally, the greater the contact and exchange that have existed between two languages, or between those languages and a third one, the greater is the ratio of [[metaphrase]] to [[paraphrase]] that may be used in translating among them. However, due to shifts in [[ecological niche]]s of words, a common [[etymology]] is sometimes misleading as a guide to current meaning in one or the other language. For example, the English ''actual'' should not be confused with the [[cognate]] French {{lang|fr|actuel}} ("present", "current"), the Polish {{lang|pl|aktualny}} ("present", "current," "topical", "timely", "feasible"),&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; the Swedish ''aktuell'' ("topical", "presently of importance"), the Russian {{lang|ru|актуальный}} ("urgent", "topical") or the Dutch ''actueel'' ("current").

The translator's role as a bridge for "carrying across" values between cultures has been discussed at least since [[Terence]], the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an [[artist]].  The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as [[Cicero]]. [[John Dryden|Dryden]] observed that "Translation is a type of drawing after life..." Comparison of the translator with a [[musician]] or [[actor]] goes back at least to [[Samuel Johnson]]'s remark about [[Alexander Pope]] playing [[Homer]] on a [[flageolet]], while Homer himself used a [[bassoon]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;
[[File:Herder by Kügelgen.jpg|thumb|left|140px|[[Johann Gottfried Herder]]]]
If translation be an art, it is no easy one.  In the 13th century, [[Roger Bacon]] wrote that if a translation is to be true, the translator must know both [[language]]s, as well as the [[science]] that he is to translate; and finding that few translators did, he wanted to do away with translation and translators altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 85-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ignacy Krasicki 111.PNG|thumb|125px|[[Ignacy Krasicki]]]]
The translator of the Bible into German, [[Martin Luther]] (1483–1546), is credited with being the first European to posit that one translates satisfactorily only toward his own language. L.G. Kelly states that since [[Johann Gottfried Herder]] in the 18th century, "it has been axiomatic" that one translates only toward his own language.&lt;ref&gt;L.G. Kelly, cited in Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Compounding the demands on the translator is the fact that no [[dictionary]] or [[thesaurus]] can ever be a fully adequate guide in translating. The Scottish historian [[Alexander Fraser Tytler, Lord Woodhouselee|Alexander Tytler]], in his ''Essay on the Principles of Translation'' (1790), emphasized that assiduous [[reading (activity)|reading]] is a more comprehensive guide to a language than are dictionaries. The same point, but also including [[listening]] to the [[spoken language|''spoken'' language]], had earlier, in 1783, been made by the Polish poet and [[grammar]]ian [[Onufry Kopczyński]].&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"&gt;Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The translator's special role in society is described in a posthumous 1803 essay by "Poland's [[La Fontaine]]", the Roman Catholic [[Primate of Poland]], [[Poetry|poet]], [[Encyclopedia|encyclopedist]], [[Novelist|author]] of the first Polish novel, and translator from French and Greek, [[Ignacy Krasicki]]:

{{blockquote|[T]ranslation... is in fact an art both estimable and very difficult, and therefore is not the labor and portion of common minds; [it] should be [practiced] by those who are themselves capable of being actors, when they see greater use in translating the works of others than in their own works, and hold higher than their own glory the service that they render their country.&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Kasparek, "The Translator's Endless Toil", p. 87, from [[Ignacy Krasicki]], {{lang|pl|"O tłumaczeniu ksiąg"}} ("On Translating Books"), in {{lang|pl|Dzieła wierszem i prozą}} (Works in Verse and Prose), 1803, reprinted in [[Edward Balcerzan]], ed., {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Other traditions===
Due to [[Western colonialism]] and cultural dominance in recent centuries, Western translation traditions have largely replaced other traditions. The Western traditions draw on both ancient and medieval traditions, and on more recent European innovations.

Though earlier approaches to translation are less commonly used today, they retain importance when dealing with their products, as when historians view ancient or medieval records to piece together events which took place in non-Western or pre-Western environments. Also, though heavily influenced by Western traditions and practiced by translators taught in Western-style educational systems, Chinese and related translation traditions retain some theories and philosophies unique to the Chinese tradition.

==== Near East ====
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
Traditions of translating material among the languages of ancient [[Egypt]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Assyria]] ([[Syriac language]]), [[Anatolia]], and [[Israel]] ([[Hebrew language]]) go back several millennia.  There exist partial translations of the Sumerian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' (c. 2000 BCE) into [[Southwest Asia]]n languages of the second millennium BCE.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of a [[bilingual]] document is the 1274 BCE [[Treaty of Kadesh]] between the [[ancient Egypt]]ian and [[Hittite Empire|Hittie empire]]s.

====Asia====
{{Further|Chinese translation theory}}
[[File:Jingangjing.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''[[Diamond Sutra]]'', translated into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] by [[Kumārajīva]]:  world's oldest known dated printed book (868 CE)]]

There is a separate tradition of translation in [[South Asia|South]], [[Southeast Asia|Southeast]] and [[East Asia]] (primarily of texts from the [[India]]n and [[China|Chinese]] civilizations), connected especially with the rendering of religious, particularly [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], texts and with the governance of the Chinese empire. Classical Indian translation is characterized by loose adaptation, rather than the closer translation more commonly found in Europe; and [[Chinese translation theory]] identifies various criteria and limitations in translation.

In the East Asian sphere of Chinese cultural influence, more important than translation ''per se'' has been the use and reading of Chinese texts, which also had substantial influence on the Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese languages, with substantial [[Sino-Xenic vocabularies|borrowings of Chinese vocabulary]] and writing system. Notable is the Japanese [[kanbun]], a system for [[Gloss (annotation)|glossing]] Chinese texts for Japanese speakers.

Though Indianized states in [[Southeast Asia]] often translated [[Sanskrit]] material into the local languages, the literate elites and scribes more commonly used Sanskrit as their primary language of culture and government.
[[File:VOA Perry Link.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Perry Link]]]]
Some special aspects of translating from [[Chinese language|Chinese]] are illustrated in [[Perry Link]]'s discussion of translating the work of the [[Tang Dynasty]] poet [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699–759 CE).&lt;ref&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry" (review of [[Eliot Weinberger]], with an afterword by [[Octavio Paz]], ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)'', New Directions; and [[Eliot Weinberger]], ''The Ghosts of Birds'', New Directions), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|Some of the art of classical [[Chinese poetry]] [writes Link] must simply be set aside as [[untranslatability|untranslatable]].  The internal structure of [[Chinese characters]] has a beauty of its own, and the [[calligraphy]] in which classical poems were written is another important but untranslatable dimension.  Since Chinese characters do not vary in length, and because there are exactly five characters per line in a poem like [the one that [[Eliot Weinberger]] discusses in ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (with More Ways)''], another untranslatable feature is that the written result, hung on a wall, presents a rectangle.  Translators into languages whose word lengths vary can reproduce such an effect only at the risk of fatal awkwardness....

Another imponderable is how to imitate the 1-2, 1-2-3 [[rhythm]] in which five-[[syllable]] lines in classical Chinese poems normally are read.  Chinese characters are pronounced in one syllable apiece, so producing such rhythms in Chinese is not hard and the results are unobtrusive; but any imitation in a Western language is almost inevitably stilted and distracting.  Even less translatable are the patterns of [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] arrangement in classical Chinese poetry.  Each syllable (character) belongs to one of two categories determined by the [[pitch contour]] in which it is read; in a classical Chinese poem the patterns of alternation of the two categories exhibit [[Parallelism (grammar)|parallelism]] and mirroring.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Once the [[untranslatability|untranslatables]] have been set aside, the problems for a translator, especially of Chinese poetry, are two:  What does the translator think the poetic line says?  And once he thinks he understands it, how can he render it into the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]?  Most of the difficulties, according to Link, arise in addressing the second problem, "where the impossibility of perfect answers spawns endless debate."  Almost always at the center is the letter-versus-spirit [[dilemma]].  At the [[literal translation|literalist]] extreme, efforts are made to dissect every conceivable detail about the language of the original Chinese poem.  "The dissection, though," writes Link, "normally does to the art of a poem approximately what the [[scalpel]] of an [[anatomy]] instructor does to the life of a frog."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 49"/&gt;

Chinese characters, in avoiding [[grammar|grammatical]] specificity, offer advantages to poets (and, simultaneously, challenges to poetry translators) that are associated primarily with absences of [[Subject (grammar)|subject]], [[Grammatical number|number]], and [[Grammatical tense|tense]].&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"&gt;[[Perry Link]], "A Magician of Chinese Poetry", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIII, no. 18 (November 24, 2016), p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the norm in classical Chinese poetry, and common even in modern Chinese prose, to omit [[Subject (grammar)|subjects]]; the reader or listener infers a subject.  Some Western languages, however, ask by grammatical rule that subjects always be stated.  Most of the translators cited in Eliot Weinberger's ''19 Ways of Looking at [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]]'' supply a subject.  Weinberger points out, however, that when an "I" as a subject is inserted, a "controlling individual mind of the poet" enters and destroys the effect of the Chinese line.  Without a subject, he writes, "the experience becomes both universal and immediate to the reader."  Another approach to the subjectlessness is to use the target language's [[passive voice]]; but this again particularizes the experience too much.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

[[Noun]]s have no [[Grammatical number|number]] in Chinese.  "If," writes Link, "you want to talk in Chinese about one rose, you may, but then you use a "[[measure word]]" to say "one blossom-of roseness."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Chinese [[verb]]s are [[grammatical tense|tense]]-less:  there are several ways to specify when something happened or will happen, but [[verb tense]] is not one of them.  For poets, this creates the great advantage of [[ambiguity]].  According to Link, Weinberger's insight about subjectlessness—that it produces an effect "both universal and immediate"—applies to timelessness as well.&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;

Link proposes a kind of uncertainty principle that may be applicable not only to translation from the Chinese language, but to all translation:

{{blockquote|Dilemmas about translation do not have definitive right answers (although there can be unambiguously wrong ones if misreadings of the original are involved).  Any translation (except machine translation, a different case) must pass through the mind of a translator, and that mind inevitably contains its own store of perceptions, memories, and values.

[[Eliot Weinberger|Weinberger]] [...] pushes this insight further when he writes that "every reading of every poem, regardless of language, is an act of translation:  translation into the reader's intellectual and emotional life."  Then he goes still further:  because a reader's mental life shifts over time, there is a sense in which "the same poem cannot be read twice."&lt;ref name="LXIII 2016 p. 50"/&gt;}}

====Islamic world====
Translation of material into [[Arabic language|Arabic]] expanded after the creation of [[Arabic script]] in the 5th century, and gained great importance with the rise of [[Islam]] and Islamic empires. Arab translation initially focused primarily on politics, rendering Persian, Greek, even Chinese and Indic diplomatic materials into Arabic. It later focused on translating classical Greek and Persian works, as well as some Chinese and Indian texts, into Arabic for scholarly study at major Islamic learning centers, such as the [[Madrasah of Al-Karaouine|Al-Karaouine]] ([[Fes]], [[Morocco]]), [[Al-Azhar Madrasah|Al-Azhar]] ([[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]), and the [[Al-Nizamiyya of Baghdad]]. In terms of theory, Arabic translation drew heavily on earlier Near Eastern traditions as well as more contemporary Greek and Persian traditions.

Arabic translation efforts and techniques are important to Western translation traditions due to centuries of close contacts and exchanges.  Especially after the [[Renaissance]], Europeans began more intensive study of Arabic and Persian translations of classical works as well as scientific and philosophical works of Arab and oriental origins.  Arabic and, to a lesser degree, Persian became important sources of material and perhaps of techniques for revitalized Western traditions, which in time would overtake the Islamic and oriental traditions.

In the 19th century, after the [[Middle East]]'s [[Islam]]ic clerics and copyists
{{blockquote|had conceded defeat in their centuries-old battle to contain the corrupting effects of the [[printing press]], [an] explosion in publishing... ensued.  Along with expanding secular education, printing transformed an overwhelmingly illiterate society into a partly literate one.

In the past, the [[sheikh]]s and the government had exercised a monopoly over knowledge.  Now an expanding elite benefitted from a stream of information on virtually anything that interested them.  Between 1880 and 1908... more than six hundred newspapers and periodicals were founded in Egypt alone.

The most prominent among them was ''al-Muqtataf''...  [It] was the popular expression of a '''translation movement''' that had begun earlier in the century with military and medical manuals and highlights from the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] canon.  ([[Montesquieu]]'s ''Considerations on the Romans'' and [[Fénelon]]'s ''Telemachus'' had been favorites.)&lt;ref name = debellaigue77&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950'', University of Chicago Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translator who contributed mightily to the advance of the Islamic Enlightenment was the Egyptian cleric Rifaa al-Tahtawi (1801–73), who had spent five years in Paris in the late 1820s, teaching religion to Muslim students.  After returning to Cairo with the encouragement of [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1769–1849), the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] viceroy of Egypt, al–Tahtawi became head of the new school of languages and embarked on an intellectual revolution by initiating a program to translate some two thousand European and Turkish volumes, ranging from ancient texts on geography and geometry to [[Voltaire]]'s biography of [[Peter the Great]], along with the ''[[Marseillaise]]'' and the entire ''[[Code Napoléon]]''.  This was the biggest, most meaningful importation of foreign thought into Arabic since [[Abbasid]] times (750–1258).&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|In France al-Tahtawi had been struck by the way the [[French language|French]] language... was constantly renewing itself to fit modern ways of living.  Yet [[Arabic]] has its own sources of reinvention.  The root system that Arabic shares with other [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] tongues such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] is capable of expanding the meanings of words using structured [[consonant]]al variations:  the word for airplane, for example, has the same root as the word for bird.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], "The Islamic Road to the Modern World" (review of [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], ''The Islamic Enlightenment:  The Struggle between Faith and Reason, 1798 to Modern Times'', Liveright; and Wael Abu-'Uksa, ''Freedom in the Arab World:  Concepts and Ideologies in Arabic Thought in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

The movement to translate English and European texts transformed the Arabic and [[Ottoman Turkey|Ottoman]] [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages, and new words, simplified [[syntax]], and directness came to be valued over the previous convolutions.  Educated Arabs and Turks in the new professions and the modernized [[civil service]] expressed [[skepticism]], writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "with a freedom that is rarely witnessed today....  No longer was legitimate knowledge defined by texts in the religious schools, interpreted for the most part with stultifying literalness.  It had come to include virtually any intellectual production anywhere in the world."  One of the [[neologisms]] that, in a way, came to characterize the infusion of new ideas via translation was ''"darwiniya"'', or "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name = debellaigue77/&gt;

One of the most influential liberal Islamic thinkers of the time was [[Muhammad Abduh]] (1849–1905), Egypt's senior judicial authority—its chief [[mufti]]—at the turn of the 20th century and an admirer of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] who in 1903 visited Darwin's exponent [[Herbert Spencer]] at his home in [[Brighton]].  Spencer's view of [[social organism|society as an organism]] with its own laws of evolution paralleled Abduh's ideas.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXII, no. 10 (June 4, 2015), p. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], when Britain and France divided up the Middle East's countries, apart from Turkey, between them, pursuant to the [[Sykes-Picot agreement]]—in violation of solemn wartime promises of postwar Arab autonomy—there came an immediate reaction:  the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] emerged in Egypt, the [[House of Saud]] took over the [[Hijaz]], and regimes led by army officers came to power in [[Iran]] and Turkey.  "[B]oth illiberal currents of the modern Middle East," writes [[Christopher de Bellaigue|de Bellaigue]], "Islamism and militarism, received a major impetus from Western [[Imperialism|empire-builders]]."  As often happens in countries undergoing social crisis, the aspirations of the Muslim world's translators and modernizers, such as Muhammad Abduh, largely had to yield to retrograde currents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher de Bellaigue]], "Dreams of Islamic Liberalism" (review of Marwa Elshakry, ''Reading Darwin in Arabic, 1860–1950''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

==Fidelity and transparency&lt;!--linked from 'Friedrich Schleiermacher'--&gt;==
[[File:John Dryden by John Michael Wright, 1668 (detail), National Portrait Gallery, London.JPG|thumb|right|175px|[[John Dryden|Dryden]]]]
[[Fidelity]] (or "faithfulness") and felicity&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; (or [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]]), dual ideals in translation, are often (though not always) at odds. A 17th-century French critic coined the phrase "{{lang|fr|les belles infidèles}}" to suggest that translations, like women, can be either faithful or beautiful, but not both.{{efn|French philosopher and writer [[Gilles Ménage]] (1613-92) commented on translations by humanist Perrot Nicolas d'Ablancourt (1606-64):  "They remind me of a woman whom I greatly loved in [[Tours]], who was beautiful but unfaithful."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Amparo Hurtado Albir, ''La notion de fidélité en traduction'' (The Idea of Fidelity in Translation), Paris, Didier Érudition, 1990, p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Fidelity]] is the extent to which a translation accurately renders the meaning of the [[source text]], without distortion.[[Transparency (linguistic)|Transparency]] is the extent to which a translation appears to a native speaker of the target language to have originally been written in that language, and conforms to its grammar, syntax and idiom. [[John Dryden]] (1631–1700) wrote in his preface to the translation anthology ''Sylvae'':
{{blockquote|Where I have taken away some of [the original authors'] Expressions, and cut them shorter, it may possibly be on this consideration, that what was beautiful in the Greek or Latin, would not appear so shining in the English; and where I have enlarg'd them, I desire the false Criticks would not always think that those thoughts are wholly mine, but that either they are secretly in the Poet, or may be fairly deduc'd from him; or at least, if both those considerations should fail, that my own is of a piece with his, and that if he were living, and an Englishman, they are such as he wou'd probably have written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dryden|first1=John|title=Preface to Sylvae|url=http://www.bartleby.com/204/180.html|website=Bartelby.com|accessdate=27 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A translation that meets the criterion of fidelity (faithfulness) is said to be "faithful"; a translation that meets the criterion of transparency, "[[idiomatic]]".  Depending on the given translation, the two qualities may not be mutually exclusive.  The criteria for judging the [[fidelity]] of a translation vary according to the subject, type and use of the text, its literary qualities, its social or historical context, etc.  The criteria for judging the [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] of a translation appear more straightforward: an unidiomatic translation "sounds wrong"; and, in the extreme case of [[literal translation|word-for-word translations]] generated by many [[machine translation|machine-translation]] systems, often results in patent nonsense.
[[File:Friedrich Daniel Ernst Schleiermacher.jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[Friedrich Schleiermacher|Schleiermacher]]]]  
Nevertheless, in certain contexts a translator may consciously seek to produce a [[literal translation]]. Translators of [[literary]], [[religious]], or [[historic]] texts often adhere as closely as possible to the source text, stretching the limits of the target language to produce an unidiomatic text.  Also, a translator may adopt expressions from the source language in order to provide "local color".
[[File:Lawrence Venuti.jpeg|thumb|90px|[[Lawrence Venuti|Venuti]]]]
While current Western translation practice is dominated by the dual concepts of "fidelity" and "transparency", this has not always been the case.  There have been periods, especially in pre-Classical Rome and in the 18th century, when many translators stepped beyond the bounds of translation proper into the realm of ''[[adaptation]]''.  [[Adapted translation]] retains currency in some non-Western traditions. The [[India]]n epic, the ''[[Ramayana]]'', appears in many versions in the various [[Languages of India|Indian languages]], and the stories are different in each.  Similar examples are to be found in [[medieval Christianity|medieval Christian]] literature, which adjusted the text to local customs and mores.

Many non-transparent-translation theories draw on concepts from [[German Romanticism]], the most obvious influence being the German theologian and philosopher [[Friedrich Schleiermacher]]. In his seminal lecture "On the Different Methods of Translation" (1813) he distinguished between translation methods that move "the writer toward [the reader]", i.e., [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]], and those that move the "reader toward [the author]", i.e., an extreme [[fidelity]] to the foreignness of the [[source text]]. Schleiermacher favored the latter approach; he was motivated, however, not so much by a desire to embrace the foreign, as by a nationalist desire to oppose France's cultural domination and to promote [[German literature]].

In recent decades, prominent advocates of such "non-transparent" translation have included the French scholar [[Antoine Berman]], who identified twelve deforming tendencies inherent in most prose translations,&lt;ref&gt;[[Antoine Berman]], ''L'épreuve de l'étranger'', 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; and the American theorist [[Lawrence Venuti]], who has called on translators to apply "foreignizing" rather than domesticating translation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lawrence Venuti]], "Call to Action", in ''The Translator's Invisibility'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equivalence===
{{main|Dynamic and formal equivalence}}
The question of [[fidelity]] vs. [[transparency (linguistic)|transparency]] has also been formulated in terms of, respectively, "''formal'' equivalence" and "''dynamic'' [or ''functional''] equivalence" – expressions associated with the translator [[Eugene Nida]] and originally coined to describe ways of translating the ''[[Bible]]''; but the two approaches are applicable to any translation.  "Formal equivalence" corresponds to "[[metaphrase]]", and "dynamic equivalence" to "[[paraphrase]]".  "Formal equivalence" (sought via [[literal translation|"literal" translation]]) attempts to render the text literally, or "word for word" (the latter expression being itself a word-for-word rendering of the [[classical Latin]] {{lang|la|verbum pro verbo}}) – if necessary, at the expense of features natural to the target language.  By contrast, "dynamic equivalence" (or "''functional'' equivalence") conveys the essential thoughts expressed in a source text—if necessary, at the expense of [[literal translation|literality]], original [[sememe]] and [[word order]], the source text's active vs. passive [[voice (grammar)|voice]], etc. 
 
There is, however, no sharp boundary between formal and functional equivalence. On the contrary, they represent a spectrum of translation approaches. Each is used at various times and in various contexts by the same translator, and at various points within the same text – sometimes simultaneously. Competent translation entails the judicious blending of formal and functional [[Dynamic and formal equivalence|equivalents]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Kasparek]], "The Translator's Endless Toil", pp. 83-87.&lt;/ref&gt;

Common pitfalls in translation, especially when practiced by inexperienced translators, involve false equivalents such as "[[false friend]]s"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blog-english.jrlanguage.com/overcome-5-challenges-of-english-to-spanish-translation/|title=How to Overcome These 5 Challenges of English to Spanish Translation|date=23 June 2017|publisher=Jr Language|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[false cognate]]s.

===Back-translation===
A "back-translation" is a translation of a translated text back into the language of the original text, made without reference to the original text. 
Comparison of a back-translation with the original text is sometimes used as a check on the accuracy of the original translation, much as the accuracy of a mathematical operation is sometimes checked by reversing the operation.  But the results of such reverse-translation operations, while useful as approximate checks, are not always precisely reliable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |title=Back Translation: Same questions – different continent |journal=Communicate |issue=Winter 2004 |page=5 |last=Crystal |first=Scott |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-11-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060520035802/http://www.atc.org.uk/winter2004.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Back-translation must in general be less accurate than back-calculation because [[linguistic]] symbols ([[word]]s) are often [[ambiguous]], whereas mathematical symbols are intentionally unequivocal.  In the context of [[machine translation]], a back-translation is also called a "round-trip translation."  When translations are produced of material used in medical [[clinical trial]]s, such as [[informed consent|informed-consent forms]], a back-translation is often required by the [[Ethics Committee (European Union)|ethics committee]] or [[institutional review board]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |title=Back Translation for Quality Control of Informed Consent Forms |journal=Journal of Clinical Research Best Practices |format=PDF |accessdate=1 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060505141653/http://www.gts-translation.com/medicaltranslationpaper.pdf |archivedate=5 May 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mark Twain, Brady-Handy photo portrait, Feb 7, 1871, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|80px|[[Mark Twain]], back-translator]]
[[Mark Twain]] provided humorously telling evidence for the frequent unreliability of back-translation when he issued his own back-translation of a French translation of his [[short story]], "[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County]]".  He published his back-translation in a 1903 volume together with his English-language original, the French translation, and a "Private History of the 'Jumping Frog' Story". The latter included a synopsized adaptation of his story that Twain stated had appeared, unattributed to Twain, in a Professor Sidgwick's ''Greek Prose Composition'' (p.&amp;nbsp;116) under the title, "The Athenian and the Frog"; the adaptation had for a time been taken for an independent [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] precursor to Twain's "Jumping Frog" story.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;id=ld_3LPm8FKkC&amp;dq=french+The+Jumping+Frog&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=web&amp;ots=4trjrMcmq3&amp;sig=P23kCS1s9qiu-1hdnJSzWWKvIJc&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ct=result#PPA66,M1 [[Mark Twain]], ''[[The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County|The Jumping Frog]]: In English, Then in French, and Then Clawed Back into a Civilized Language Once More by Patient, Unremunerated Toil'', illustrated by F. Strothman, New York and London, Harper &amp; Brothers, Publishers, MCMIII [1903&amp;#93;].&lt;/ref&gt;

When a document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel ''[[The Manuscript Found in Saragossa|The Saragossa Manuscript]]'' by the Polish aristocrat [[Jan Potocki]] (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by [[Edmund Chojecki]] in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost. French-language versions of the complete ''Saragossa Manuscript'' have since been produced, based on extant French-language fragments and on French-language versions that have been back-translated from Chojecki's Polish version.&lt;ref&gt;[[Czesław Miłosz]], ''The History of Polish Literature'', pp. 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many works by the influential [[classical antiquity|Classical]] physician [[Galen]] survive only in medieval [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translation. Some survive only in [[Renaissance Latin]] translations from the Arabic, thus at a second remove from the original. To better understand Galen, scholars have attempted back-translation of such works in order to reconstruct the original [[ancient Greek|Greek]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

When historians suspect that a document is actually a translation from another language, back-translation into that hypothetical original language can provide supporting evidence by showing that such characteristics as [[idiom]]s, [[pun]]s, peculiar [[grammar|grammatical]] structures, etc., are in fact derived from the original language.  For example, the known text of the ''[[Till Eulenspiegel]]'' folk tales is in [[High German]] but contains puns that work only when back-translated to [[Low German]].  This seems clear evidence that these tales (or at least large portions of them) were originally written in Low German and translated into High German by an over-metaphrastic translator.

Supporters of [[Aramaic primacy]]—of the view that the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[New Testament]] or its sources were originally written in the [[Aramaic language]]—seek to prove their case by showing that difficult passages in the existing [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] text of the New Testament make much better sense when back-translated to [[Aramaic]]: that, for example, some incomprehensible references are in fact Aramaic puns that do not work in Greek.  Due to similar indications, it is believed that the 2nd century Gnostic [[Gospel of Judas]], which survives only in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], was originally written in [[Greek language|Greek]].

[[John Dryden]] (1631–1700), the dominant English-language literary figure of his age, illustrates, in his use of back-translation, translators' influence on the evolution of languages and literary styles.  Dryden is believed to be the first person to posit that English sentences should not end in [[preposition]]s because Latin sentences cannot end in prepositions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/lexicography/data/B_HIST_EU.html Gilman, E.

Pullum, 2002, The Cambridge Grammar of the English Language. Cambridge (UK): Cambridge University Press, p. 627f.&lt;/ref&gt;  Dryden often translated his writing into [[Latin]], to check whether his writing was concise and elegant, Latin being considered an elegant and long-lived language with which to compare; then he back-translated his writing back to English according to Latin-grammar usage. As Latin does not have sentences ending in prepositions, Dryden may have applied Latin grammar to English, thus forming the controversial rule of no sentence-ending prepositions, subsequently adopted by other writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=3komDgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=word+by+word+kory+stamper#v=onepage&amp;q=word%20by%20word%20kory%20stamper&amp;f=false|title=Word by Word: The Secret Life of Dictionaries|last=Stamper|first=Kory|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|year=|isbn=9781101870945|location=|pages=47|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Cf. a supposed comment by [[Winston Churchill]]:  "This is the type of pedantry up with which I will not put."}}

== Translators ==
Competent translators show the following attributes:
*a ''very good'' knowledge of the language, written and spoken, ''from which'' they are translating (the [[Source language (translation)|source language]]);
*an ''excellent'' command of the language ''into which'' they are translating (the [[Target language (translation)|target language]]);
*familiarity with the subject matter of the text being translated;
*a profound understanding of the [[etymological]] and [[idiomatic]] correlates between the two languages, including [[Register (sociolinguistics)|sociolinguistic register]] when appropriate; and
*a finely tuned sense of when to ''[[metaphrase]]'' ([[literal translation|"translate literally]]") and when to ''[[paraphrase]]'', so as to assure true rather than spurious ''[[Translation#Equivalence|equivalents]]'' between the source- and target-language texts.&lt;ref&gt;*[[Christopher Kasparek]], "Prus' ''Pharaoh'' and Curtin's Translation," ''[[The Polish Review]]'', vol. XXXI, nos. 2–3 (1986), p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt;

A competent translator is not only [[bilingual]] but [[bicultural]].  A [[language]] is not merely a collection of [[word]]s and of rules of [[grammar]] and [[syntax]] for generating [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s, but also a vast interconnecting system of [[connotation]]s and [[culture|cultural]] references whose mastery, writes [[linguist]] [[Mario Pei]], "comes close to being a lifetime job."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mario Pei]], ''The Story of Language'', p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;  The complexity of the translator's task cannot be overstated; one author suggests that becoming an accomplished translator—after having already acquired a good basic knowledge of both languages and cultures—may require a minimum of ten years' experience.  Viewed in this light, it is a serious misconception to assume that a person who has fair fluency in two languages will, by virtue of that fact alone, be consistently competent to translate between them.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 86"/&gt;

The translator's role in relation to a text has been compared to that of an artist, e.g., a musician or actor, who interprets a work of art.  Translation, like other human activities,&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Greenblatt]], "Can We Ever Master King Lear?", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 3 (February 23, 2017), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; entails making choices, and choice implies interpretation.&lt;ref name="Kasparek p. 85"/&gt;{{efn|"Interpretation" in this sense is to be distinguished from the function of an "[[Translation#Interpreting|"interpreter"]] who translates orally or by the use of [[sign language]].}}  [[Mark Polizzotti]] writes:  "A good translation offers not a reproduction of the work but an interpretation, a re-representation, just as the performance of a [[Play (theatre)|play]] or a [[sonata]] is a representation of the [[Play (theatre)|script]] or the [[Sheet music|score]], one among many possible representations."&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Polizzotti]], quoted in [[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The English-language novelist [[Joseph Conrad]], whose writings [[Zdzisław Najder]] has described as verging on "auto-translation" from Conrad's Polish and French linguistic personae,&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. IX.&lt;/ref&gt; advised his niece and [[Polish language|Polish]] translator [[Aniela Zagórska]]:  "[D]on't trouble to be too scrupulous...  I may tell you (in French) that in my opinion ''il vaut mieux interpréter que traduire'' [it is better to interpret than to translate]....  ''Il s'agit donc de trouver les équivalents.  Et là, ma chère, je vous prie laissez vous guider plutôt par votre tempérament que par une conscience sévère....'' [It is, then, a question of finding the equivalent expressions.  And there, my dear, I beg you to let yourself be guided more by your temperament than by a strict conscience....]"&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 524.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad advised another translator that the prime requisite for a good translation is that it be "idiomatic".  "For in the [[idiom]] is the ''clearness'' of a language and the language's force and its picturesqueness—by which last I mean the picture-producing power of arranged words."&lt;ref&gt;[[Zdzisław Najder]], ''Joseph Conrad:  A Life'', 2007, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conrad thought [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]'s English translation of [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''À la recherche du temps perdu'' (''[[In Search of Lost Time]]''—or, in Scott Moncrieff's rendering, ''Remembrance of Things Past'') to be preferable to the French original.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Kaiser, "A Hero of Translation" (a review of Jean Findlay, ''Chasing Lost Time:  The Life of [[C.K. Scott Moncrieff]]:  Soldier, Spy, and Translator''), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol.

The necessity of making [[choice]]s, and therefore of interpretation, in translating{{efn|[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]] writes that "translation always involves interpretation, and [requires] every translator... to think as deeply as humanly possible about each verbal, poetic, and interpretative [[choice]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Emily Wilson]], "A Doggish Translation" (review of ''The Poems of [[Hesiod]]:  Theogony, Works and Days, and The Shield of Herakles'', translated from the Greek by [[Barry B.

LXV, no. 1 (18 January 2018), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;}} (and in other fields of human endeavor) stems from the [[ambiguity]] that subjectively pervades the [[universe]].  Part of the ambiguity, for a translator, involves the structure of human [[language]]. [[Psychology|Psychologist]] and [[neural science|neural scientist]] [[Gary Marcus]] notes that "virtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways.  Our brain is so good at comprehending language that we do not usually notice."&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;  An example of linguistic ambiguity is the "pronoun disambiguation problem" ("PDP"):  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish artificial intelligence from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such disambiguation is not infallible by a human, either.

Ambiguity is a concern to both translators and, as the writings of poet and literary critic [[William Empson]] have demonstrated, to [[literary criticism|literary critics]].  Ambiguity may be desirable, indeed essential, in [[poetry]] and [[diplomacy]]; it can be more problematic in ordinary [[prose]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bromwich]], "In Praise of Ambiguity" (a review of [[Michael Wood (academic)|Michael Wood]], ''On Empson'', [[Princeton University Press]], 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''), vol. LXIV, no. 16 (26 October 2017), pp. 50–52.&lt;/ref&gt;

A translator is faced with two contradictory tasks:  when translating, he must strive for [[omniscience]]; when reviewing his translation, he must assume (the naive reader's) [[ignorance]]. 

A translator may render only parts of the original text, provided he indicates that this is what he is doing.  But a translator should not assume the role of [[Censorship|censor]] and surreptitiously delete or [[bowdlerize]] passages merely to please a political or moral interest.&lt;ref name="Billiani, Francesca 2001"&gt;Billiani, Francesca (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

Translating has served as a school of writing for many an author, much as the copying of masterworks of [[painting]] has schooled many a novice painter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anka Muhlstein]], "Painters and Writers:  When Something New Happens", ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 1 (January 19, 2017), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  A translator who can competently render an author's thoughts into the translator's own language, should certainly be able to adequately render, in his own language, any thoughts of his own.  Translating (like [[analytic philosophy]]) compels precise analysis of [[language|language element]]s and of their usage.  In 1946 the poet [[Ezra Pound]], then at [[St. Elizabeth's Hospital]], in [[Washington, D.C.]], advised a visitor, the 18-year-old beginning poet [[W.S. Merwin]]:  "The work of translation is the best teacher you'll ever have."&lt;ref&gt;''[[W.S. Merwin: To Plant a Tree]]'':  one-hour documentary shown on [[PBS]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|Elsewhere Merwin recalls Pound saying:  "[A]t your age you don't have anything to write about.  You may think you do, but you don't.  So get to work translating.  The [[Occitan language|Provençal]] is the real source...."&lt;ref&gt;[[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Merwin, translator-poet who took Pound's advice to heart, writes of translation as an "impossible, unfinishable" art.&lt;ref&gt;Merwin's introduction to his 2013 ''Selected Translations'', quoted by [[Ange Mlinko]], "Whole Earth Troubador" (review of ''The Essential W.S. Merlin'', edited by [[Michael Wiegers]], Copper Canyon, 338 pp., 2017), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 19 (7 December 2017), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translators, including monks who spread [[Buddhist]] texts in [[East Asia]], and the early modern European translators of the [[Bible]], in the course of their work have shaped the very [[language]]s into which they have translated. They have acted as bridges for conveying knowledge between [[culture]]s; and along with ideas, they have imported from the source languages, into their own languages, [[loanword]]s and [[calque]]s of [[grammar|grammatical structures]], [[idiom]]s, and [[vocabulary]].

===Interpreting===

{{Main|Interpreting}}
[[Interpreting]], or "interpretation," is the facilitation of [[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]] [[communication]], either simultaneously or consecutively, between two, or among three or more, speakers who are not speaking, or signing, the same language.  The term "interpreting," rather than "interpretation," is preferentially used for this activity by [[English language|Anglophone]] translators, to avoid confusion with other meanings of the word "[[wikt:interpret|interpretation]]."  Unlike English, many languages do not employ two separate words to denote the activities of [[writing|written]] and live-communication ([[speech communication|oral]] or [[sign language|sign-language]]) translators.{{efn|For example, in [[Polish language|Polish]], a "translation" is "{{lang|pl|przekład}}" or "{{lang|pl|tłumaczenie}}." Both "translator" and "interpreter" are "{{lang|pl|tłumacz}}." For a time in the 18th century, however, for "translator," some writers used a word, "{{lang|pl|przekładowca}}," that is no longer in use.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Balcerzan]], {{lang|pl|Pisarze polscy o sztuce przekładu, 1440–1974: Antologia}} (Polish Writers on the Art of Translation, 1440–1974: an Anthology), 1977, ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Even English does not always make the distinction, frequently using "translating" as a synonym for "interpreting."

Interpreters have sometimes played crucial roles in [[History of the world|history]].  A prime example is [[La Malinche]], also known as ''Malintzin'', ''Malinalli'' and ''Doña Marina'', an early-16th-century [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] woman from the Mexican [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]].  As a child she had been sold or given to [[Maya peoples|Maya]] slave-traders from Xicalango, and thus had become bilingual. Subsequently, given along with other women to the invading Spaniards, she became instrumental in the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest of [[Mexico]], acting as interpreter, adviser, intermediary and lover to [[Hernán Cortés]].&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Thomas, ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cortes and the Fall of Old Mexico'', New York, Simon and Schuster, 1993, pp. 171-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly three centuries later, in the [[United States]], a comparable role as interpreter was played for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] of 1804–6 by [[Sacagawea]]. As a child, the [[Lemhi Shoshone]] woman had been kidnapped by [[Hidatsa]] Indians and thus had become bilingual.  Sacagawea facilitated the expedition's traverse of the [[North American continent]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;"Sacagawea", ''[[The Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, volume 24, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sworn translation===
[[Translating for legal equivalence|Sworn translation]], also called "certified translation," aims at legal equivalence between two documents written in different languages. It is performed by someone authorized to do so by local regulations. Some countries recognize declared competence. Others require the translator to be an official state appointee. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, translators must be accredited by certain translation institutes or associations in order to be able to carry out certified translations.

===Telephone===
Many commercial services exist that will interpret spoken language via telephone.  There is also at least one custom-built mobile device that does the same thing. The device connects users to human interpreters who can translate between English and 180 other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2013/06/27/186525030/translation-please-hand-held-device-bridges-language-gap |title=Translation, Please: Hand-Held Device Bridges Language Gap |publisher=NPR |accessdate=2014-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet===
Web-based human translation is generally favored by companies and individuals that wish to secure more accurate translations. In view of the frequent inaccuracy of machine translations, human translation remains the most reliable, most accurate form of translation available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/15582327?story_id=15582327&amp;source=hptextfeature | work=The Economist | title=The many voices of the web | date=2010-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the recent emergence of translation [[crowdsourcing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Graham |first=Paul |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |title=How Ackuna wants to fix language translation by crowdsourcing it &amp;#124; Wired UK |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120517232045/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2011-07/04/mechanical-turkish-ackuna |archive-date=2012-05-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.benzinga.com/press-releases/11/02/p843476/translation-services-usas-crowdsourcing-translator-ackuna-com-raises-th |title=Translation Services USA's Crowdsourcing Translator, Ackuna.com, Raises the Bar for More Accurate Machine Translations |publisher=Benzinga |date= |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Translation memory|translation-memory]] techniques, and [[internet]] applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/346412 |title=Translation Cloud Application for Facebook Releases Version 2.0 |publisher=Digital Journal |date=2011-06-24 |accessdate=2012-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; translation agencies have been able to provide on-demand human-translation services to [[Small and medium businesses|business]]es, individuals, and enterprises.

Babel Fish]], web-based human translation has been gaining popularity by providing relatively fast, accurate translation of business communications, legal documents, medical records, and [[software localization]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://venturebeat.com/2010/03/26/speaklike-offers-human-powered-translation-for-blogs/ |title = Speaklike offers human-powered translation for blogs |website =  VentureBeat |last= Boutin|first = Paul|date = 26 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Web-based human translation also appeals to private website users and bloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/01/11/AR2010011100701.html | work=The Washington Post | title=MyGengo Is Mechanical Turk For Translations | first=Serkan | last=Toto | date=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contents of websites are translatable but urls of websites are not translatable into other languages.

===Computer assist===
{{Main|Computer-assisted translation}}
Computer-assisted translation (CAT), also called "computer-aided translation," "machine-aided human translation" (MAHT) and "interactive translation," is a form of translation wherein a human translator creates a [[target text]] with the assistance of a computer program. The machine supports a human translator.

Computer-assisted translation can include standard [[dictionary]] and grammar software. The term, however, normally refers to a range of specialized programs available to the translator, including [[translation memory|translation-memory]], [[terminology|terminology-management]], [[concordancer|concordance]], and alignment programs.

These tools speed up and facilitate human translation, but they do not provide translation.  The latter is a function of tools known broadly as machine translation.

==Machine translation==
{{Main|Machine translation}}
Machine translation (MT) is a process whereby a computer program analyzes a [[source text]] and, in principle, produces a target text without human intervention. In reality, however, machine translation typically does involve human intervention, in the form of pre-editing and [[post-editing]].&lt;ref name="NIST"&gt;See the [https://www.nist.gov/speech/tests/mt/ annually performed NIST tests since 2001] and [[Bilingual Evaluation Understudy]]&lt;/ref&gt;  With proper [[terminology|terminology work]], with preparation of the [[source text]] for machine translation (pre-editing), and with reworking of the machine translation by a human translator (post-editing), commercial machine-translation tools can produce useful results, especially if the machine-translation system is integrated with a [[translation memory|translation-memory]] or [[Globalization Management System|globalization-management system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Unedited machine translation is publicly available through tools on the [[Internet]] such as [[Google Translate]], [[Babel Fish (website)|Babel Fish]], [[Babylon translator|Babylon]], and [[StarDict]]. These produce rough translations that, under favorable circumstances, "give the gist" of the source text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://blog.ititranslates.com/why-translation-services-are-more-beneficial-than-machined-translation-programs|title=Why Professional Translators Are More Beneficial Than Google Translate|last=Choquette|first=Brandon|date=January 2016|journal=Interpreter and Translators, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With the Internet, translation software can help non-native-speaking individuals understand web pages published in other languages. Whole-page-translation tools are of limited utility, however, since they offer only a limited potential understanding of the original author's intent and context; translated pages tend to be more erroneously humorous and confusing than enlightening.

Interactive translations with [[Pop-up ad|pop-up windows]] are becoming more popular. These tools show one or more possible equivalents for each word or phrase. Human operators merely need to select the likeliest equivalent as the mouse glides over the foreign-language text. Possible equivalents can be grouped by pronunciation.  Also, companies such as [[Ectaco]] produce pocket devices that provide machine translations.
[[File:Claude Piron.jpg|thumb|90px|[[Claude Piron]]]]
Relying exclusively on unedited machine translation, however, ignores the fact that communication in [[natural language|human language]] is [[wikt:context|context]]-embedded and that it takes a person to comprehend the context of the original text with a reasonable degree of probability. It is certainly true that even purely human-generated translations are prone to error; therefore, to ensure that a machine-generated translation will be useful to a human being and that publishable-quality translation is achieved, such translations must be reviewed and edited by a human.{{efn|J.M. Cohen observes: "Scientific translation is the aim of an age that would reduce all activities to [[Technology|techniques]]. It is impossible however to imagine a literary-translation machine less complex than the human brain itself, with all its knowledge, reading, and discrimination."&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, "Translation", ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]'', 1986, vol. 27, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;}}  [[Claude Piron]] writes that machine translation, at its best, automates the easier part of a translator's job; the harder and more time-consuming part usually involves doing extensive research to resolve [[ambiguity|ambiguities]] in the [[source text]], which the [[grammatical]] and [[lexical (semiotics)|lexical]] exigencies of the target language require to be resolved.&lt;ref&gt;[[Claude Piron]], ''Le défi des langues'' (The Language Challenge), Paris, L'Harmattan, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Such research is a necessary prelude to the pre-editing necessary in order to provide input for machine-translation software, such that the output will not be [[garbage in garbage out|meaningless]].&lt;ref name="NIST"/&gt;

The weaknesses of pure [[machine translation]], unaided by human expertise, are [[Logology (science of science)#Artificial intelligence|those of artificial intelligence itself]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Marcus]], "Am I Human?:  Researchers need new ways to distinguish [[artificial intelligence]] from the natural kind", ''[[Scientific American]]'', vol. 316, no. 3 (March 2017), pp. 58–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Translator Mark Polizzotti holds that machine translation, by [[Google Translate]] and the like, is unlikely to threaten human translators anytime soon, because machines will never grasp nuance and [[connotation]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Emily Wilson (classicist)|Wilson, Emily]], "The Pleasures of Translation" (review of Mark Polizzotti, ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', MIT Press, 2018, 182 pp.), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXV, no. 9 (24 May 2018), p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary translation==
Translation of [[literature|literary works]] ([[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], [[theatre|plays]], [[poetry|poems]], etc.) is considered a literary pursuit in its own right. Notable in [[Canadian literature]] ''specifically'' as translators are figures such as [[Sheila Fischman]], [[Robert Dickson (writer)|Robert Dickson]], and [[Linda Gaboriau]]; and the Canadian [[Governor General's Awards]] annually present prizes for the best English-to-French and French-to-English literary translations.

Other writers, among many who have made a name for themselves as literary translators, include [[Vasily Zhukovsky]], [[Tadeusz Boy-Żeleński]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Robert Stiller]], [[Lydia Davis]], [[Haruki Murakami]], [[Achy Obejas]], and [[Jhumpa Lahiri]].

In the 2010s a substantial gender imbalance was noted in literary translation into English,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wordswithoutborders.org/dispatches/article/where-are-the-women-in-translation|title=Where Are the Women in Translation?|last=Anderson|first=Alison|date=May 14, 2013|website=Words Without Borders|access-date=July 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with far more male writers being translated than women writers. In 2014 Meytal Radzinski launched the ''Women in Translation'' campaign to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://literarytranslators.wordpress.com/2016/07/25/women-in-translation-an-interview-witth-meytal-radzinski/|title=Women in Translation: An Interview with Meytal Radzinski|date=25 July 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebookseller.com/tags-bookseller/meytal-radzinski|title=Meytal Radzinski - The Bookseller|website=www.thebookseller.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblibio.blogspot.com/2018/07/exclusion-is-choice-bias-in-best-of.html|title=Biblibio: Exclusion is a choice - Bias in "Best of" lists|first=Meytal|last=Radzinski|date=3 July 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
The first important translation in the West was that of the [[Septuagint]], a collection of [[Jew]]ish Scriptures translated into early [[Koine Greek]] in [[Alexandria]] between the 3rd and 1st centuries BCE. The dispersed [[Jew]]s had forgotten their ancestral language and needed Greek versions (translations) of their Scriptures.&lt;ref&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the [[Middle Ages]], [[Latin]] was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of the western learned world. The 9th-century [[Alfred the Great]], king of [[Wessex]] in [[England]], was far ahead of his time in commissioning [[vernacular]] [[Anglo-Saxon language|Anglo-Saxon]] translations of [[Bede]]'s ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum|Ecclesiastical History]]'' and [[Boethius]]' ''[[Consolation of Philosophy]]''. Meanwhile, the [[Christian Church]] frowned on even partial adaptations of [[St. Jerome]]'s ''[[Vulgate Bible|Vulgate]]'' of c. 384 CE,&lt;ref&gt;J.M Cohen, pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; the standard [[Latin]] ''[[Bible]]''.

In [[Asia]], the spread of [[Buddhism]] led to large-scale ongoing translation efforts spanning well over a thousand years. The [[Tangut Empire]] was especially efficient in such efforts; exploiting the then newly invented [[block printing]], and with the full support of the government (contemporary sources describe the Emperor and his mother personally contributing to the translation effort, alongside sages of various nationalities), the Tanguts took mere decades to translate volumes that had taken the [[China|Chinese]] centuries to render.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The [[Arabs]] undertook large-scale efforts at translation.  Having conquered the Greek world, they made [[Arabic]] versions of its philosophical and scientific works.  During the [[Middle Ages]], translations of some of these Arabic versions were made into Latin, chiefly at [[Córdoba, Spain|Córdoba]] in [[Spain]].&lt;ref name="Cohen13"&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;  King Alfonso X el Sabio (Alphonse the Wise) of Castille in the 13th century promoted this effort by founding a ''Schola Traductorum'' (School of Translation) in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]].  There Arabic texts, Hebrew texts, and Latin texts were translated into the other tongues by Muslim, Jewish and Christian scholars, who also argued the merits of their respective religions.  Latin translations of Greek and original Arab works of scholarship and science helped advance European [[Scholasticism]], and thus European science and culture.
[[File:Chaucer Hoccleve.png|thumb|170px|[[Geoffrey Chaucer]]]]
The broad historic trends in Western translation practice may be illustrated on the example of translation into the [[English language]].

The first fine translations into English were made in the 14th century by [[Geoffrey Chaucer]], who adapted from the [[Italian language|Italian]] of [[Giovanni Boccaccio]] in his own ''[[Knight's Tale]]'' and ''[[Troilus and Criseyde]]''; began a translation of the [[French-language]] ''[[Roman de la Rose]]''; and completed a translation of [[Boethius]] from the [[Latin]]. Chaucer founded an English [[poetry|poetic]] tradition on ''[[Literary adaptation|adaptations]]'' and translations from those earlier-established [[literary language]]s.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The first great English translation was the ''[[Wycliffe Bible]]'' (c. 1382), which showed the weaknesses of an underdeveloped English [[prose]]. Only at the end of the 15th century did the great age of English prose translation begin with [[Thomas Malory]]'s ''[[Le Morte Darthur]]''—an adaptation of [[Arthurian romance]]s so free that it can, in fact, hardly be called a true translation. The first great [[Tudor period|Tudor]] translations are, accordingly, the ''[[Tyndale Bible|Tyndale New Testament]]'' (1525), which influenced the ''[[Authorized Version]]'' (1611), and [[Lord Berners]]' version of [[Jean Froissart]]'s ''Chronicles'' (1523–25).&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;
[[File:Portrait of Marsilio Ficino at the Duomo Firence 2.jpg|thumb|120px|[[Marsilio Ficino]]]]
Meanwhile, in [[Renaissance]] [[Italy]], a new period in the history of translation had opened in [[Florence]] with the arrival, at the court of [[Cosimo de' Medici]], of the [[Byzantine]] scholar [[Georgius Gemistus Pletho]] shortly before the fall of [[Constantinople]] to the Turks (1453). A Latin translation of [[Plato]]'s works was undertaken by [[Marsilio Ficino]]. This and [[Erasmus]]' Latin edition of the ''[[New Testament]]'' led to a new attitude to translation. For the first time, readers demanded rigor of rendering, as philosophical and religious beliefs depended on the exact words of [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]] and [[Jesus]].&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

Non-scholarly literature, however, continued to rely on ''adaptation''. [[France]]'s ''[[Pléiade]]'', [[England]]'s [[Tudor period|Tudor]] poets, and the [[Elizabethan]] translators adapted themes by [[Horace]], [[Ovid]], [[Petrarch]] and modern Latin writers, forming a new poetic style on those models. The English poets and translators sought to supply a new public, created by the rise of a [[middle class]] and the development of [[printing]], with works such as the original authors ''would have written'', had they been writing in England in that day.&lt;ref name=Cohen13/&gt;

The [[Elizabethan]] period of translation saw considerable progress beyond mere [[paraphrase]] toward an ideal of [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistic]] equivalence, but even to the end of this period, which actually reached to the middle of the 17th century, there was no concern for [[Words|verbal]] [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=Cohen14&gt;J.M. Cohen, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second half of the 17th century, the poet [[John Dryden]] sought to make [[Virgil]] speak "in words such as he would probably have written if he were living and an Englishman". As great as Dryden's poem is, however, one is reading Dryden, and not experiencing the Roman poet's concision. Similarly, [[Homer]] arguably suffers from [[Alexander Pope]]'s endeavor to reduce the Greek poet's "wild paradise" to order. Both works live on as worthy ''English'' epics, more than as a point of access to the Latin or Greek.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Edward FitzGerald.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]]]
Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted. They cheerfully assumed that their own style of expression was the best, and that texts should be made to conform to it in translation. For scholarship they cared no more than had their predecessors, and they did not shrink from making translations from translations in third languages, or from languages that they hardly knew, or—as in the case of [[James Macpherson]]'s "translations" of [[Ossian]]—from texts that were actually of the "translator's" own composition.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;
[[File:Benjamin Jowett - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|80px|[[Benjamin Jowett]]]]
The 19th century brought new standards of accuracy and style. In regard to accuracy, observes J.M. Cohen, the policy became "the text, the whole text, and nothing but the text", except for any [[bawdy]] passages and the addition of copious explanatory [[footnote]]s.{{efn|For instance, Henry Benedict Mackey's translation of [[St. Francis de Sales]]'s "[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/desales/love.html Treatise on the Love of God]" consistently omits the saint's analogies comparing God to a nursing mother, references to Bible stories such as the rape of Tamar, and so forth.}} In regard to style, the [[Victorians]]' aim, achieved through far-reaching [[metaphrase]] (literality) or ''pseudo''-metaphrase, was to constantly remind readers that they were reading a ''foreign'' classic. An exception was the outstanding translation in this period, [[Edward FitzGerald (poet)|Edward FitzGerald]]'s ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]'' of [[Omar Khayyam]] (1859), which achieved its Oriental flavor largely by using Persian names and discreet Biblical echoes and actually drew little of its material from the Persian original.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

In advance of the 20th century, a new pattern was set in 1871 by [[Benjamin Jowett]], who translated [[Plato]] into simple, straightforward language. Jowett's example was not followed, however, until well into the new century, when accuracy rather than style became the principal criterion.&lt;ref name=Cohen14/&gt;

===Modern translation===
As a language evolves, texts in an earlier version of the language—original texts, or old translations—may become difficult for modern readers to understand. Such a text may therefore be translated into more modern language, producing a "modern translation" (e.g., a "modern English translation" or "modernized translation").

Such modern rendering is applied either to literature from classical languages such as [[Latin]] or [[Greek language|Greek]], notably to the [[Bible]] (see "[[Modern English Bible translations]]"), or to literature from an earlier stage of the same language, as with the works of [[William Shakespeare]] (which are largely understandable by a modern audience, though with some difficulty) or with [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s Middle English ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'' (which is understandable to most modern readers only through heavy dependence on footnotes).

Modern translation is applicable to any language with a long literary history.  For example, in Japanese the 11th-century ''[[The Tale of Genji|Tale of Genji]]'' is generally read in modern translation  (see "[[The Tale of Genji#Modern readership|''Genji:'' modern readership]]").

Modern translation often involves literary scholarship and textual revision, as there is frequently not one single canonical text. This is particularly noteworthy in the case of the Bible and Shakespeare, where modern scholarship can result in substantive textual changes.

Modern translation meets with opposition from some traditionalists.  In English, some readers prefer the [[Authorized King James Version]] of the Bible to modern translations, and Shakespeare in the original of c. 1600 to modern translations.

An opposite process involves translating modern literature into classical languages, for the purpose of [[extensive reading]] (for examples, see "[[List of Latin translations of modern literature]]").

===Poetry===
[[File:Hofstadter2002B.jpg|thumb|75px|[[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter]]]]
[[File:Roman Jakobson.jpg|thumb|65px|[[Roman Jakobson|Jakobson]]]]
[[File:Vladimir Nabokov 1973.jpg|thumb|55px|[[Vladimir Nabokov|Nabokov]]]]
Views on the possibility of satisfactorily translating poetry show a broad spectrum, depending largely on the degree of latitude to be granted the translator in regard to a poem's formal features (rhythm, rhyme, verse form, etc.).  [[Douglas Hofstadter]], in his 1997 book, ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', argued that a good translation of a poem must convey as much as possible not only of its literal meaning but also of its form and structure (meter, rhyme or alliteration scheme, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;A discussion of Hofstadter's otherwise latitudinarian views on translation is found in Tony Dokoupil, "[http://www.newsweek.com/id/195684 Translation: Pardon My French: You Suck at This]," ''[[Newsweek]]'', May 18, 2009, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Russia]]n-born [[linguist]] and [[semiotician]] [[Roman Jakobson]], however, had in his 1959 paper "[[On Linguistic Aspects of Translation]]", declared that "poetry by definition [is] untranslatable".  [[Vladimir Nabokov]], another Russian-born author, took a view similar to Jakobson's.  He considered rhymed, metrical, versed poetry to be in principle untranslatable and therefore rendered his 1964 English translation of [[Alexander Pushkin]]'s [[Eugene Onegin#Into English|''Eugene Onegin'' in prose]].

Hofstadter, in ''[[Le Ton beau de Marot]]'', criticized Nabokov's attitude toward verse translation.  In 1999 Hofstadter published his own translation of ''Eugene Onegin'', in verse form.

Gregory Hays, in the course of discussing [[ancient Rome|Roman]] adapted translations of [[ancient Greek literature]], makes approving reference to some views on the translating of poetry expressed by [[David Bellos]], an accomplished French-to-English translator.  Hays writes:
{{blockquote|Among the ''idées reçues'' [received ideas] skewered by David Bellos is the old saw that "poetry is what gets lost in translation."  The saying is often attributed to [[Robert Frost]], but as Bellos notes, the attribution is as dubious as the idea itself.  A translation is an assemblage of words, and as such it can contain as much or as little poetry as any other such assemblage.  The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] even have a word (''chōyaku'', roughly "hypertranslation") to designate a version that deliberately improves on the original.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Hays, "Found in Translation" (review of [[Denis Feeney]], ''Beyond Greek:  The Beginnings of Latin Literature'', Harvard University Press), ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', vol. LXIV, no. 11 (22 June 2017), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Book titles ===

Book-title translations can be either descriptive or symbolic. Descriptive book titles, for example [[Antoine de Saint-Exupéry]]'s ''[[Le Petit Prince]]''  (The Little Prince), are meant to be informative, and can name the protagonist, and indicate the theme of the book.  An example of a symbolic book title is [[Stieg Larsson]]'s  ''[[The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]]'', whose original Swedish title is ''Män som hatar kvinnor''  (Men Who Hate Women).  Such symbolic book titles usually indicate the theme, issues, or atmosphere of the work.

When translators are working with long book titles, the translated titles are often shorter and indicate the theme of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plays ===

The translation of plays poses many problems such as the added element of actors, speech duration, translation literalness, and the relationship between the arts of drama and acting. Successful play translators are able to create language that allows the actor and the playwright to work together effectively.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson, "Problems in Play Translation", ''Educational Theatre Journal'' 16, no. 1 (1964), pp. 55-58. {{doi|10.2307/3204378}}, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Play translators must also take into account several other aspects: the final performance, varying theatrical and acting traditions, characters' speaking styles, modern theatrical discourse, and even the acoustics of the auditorium, i.e., whether certain words will have the same effect on the new audience as they had on the original audience.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, pp. 129-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

Audiences in Shakespeare's time were more accustomed than modern playgoers to actors having longer stage time.&lt;ref&gt;Harry G. Carlson, "Problems in Play Translation", ''Educational Theatre Journal'' 16, no. 1 (1964), pp. 55-58. {{doi|10.2307/3204378}}, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern translators tend to simplify the sentence structures of earlier dramas, which included compound sentences with intricate hierarchies of subordinate clauses.&lt;ref&gt;Jiří Levý, ''The Art of Translation'', Philadelphia, John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Loren Kruger, "Keywords and Contexts: Translating Theatre Theory", ''Theatre Journal'' 59, no. 3 (2007), pp. 355-58. {{jstor|25070054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chinese literature ===
In translating Chinese literature, translators struggle to find true fidelity in translating into the [[target language (translation)|target language]]. In ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Barnstone argues that poetry "can't be made to sing through a mathematics that doesn't factor in the creativity of the translator".&lt;ref&gt;Frank Stewart, ''The Poem Behind the Poem'', Washington, Copper Canyon Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable piece of work translated into English is the ''[[Wen Xuan]]'', an anthology representative of major works of Chinese literature. Translating this work requires a high knowledge of the [[genre]]s presented in the book, such as poetic forms, various prose types including memorials, letters, proclamations, praise poems, edicts, and historical, philosophical and political disquisitions, threnodies and laments for the dead, and examination essays. Thus the literary translator must be familiar with the writings, lives, and thought of a large number of its 130 authors, making the ''Wen Xuan'' one of the most difficult literary works to translate.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Eoyang and Lin Yao-fu, ''Translating Chinese Literature'', Indiana University Press, 1995, pp. 42–43.&lt;/ref&gt;

Translation generally, much as with [[Kurt Gödel]]'s [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|conception of mathematics]], requires, to varying extents, more information than appears in the page of text being translated.

===Sung texts===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Catherine Winkworth.PNG|thumb|left|100px|[[Catherine Winkworth]]]] --&gt;
Translation of a text that is sung in vocal music for the purpose of singing in another language—sometimes called "singing translation"—is closely linked to translation of poetry because most [[vocal music]], at least in the Western tradition, is set to [[Verse (popular music)|verse]], especially verse in regular patterns with [[rhyme]]. (Since the late 19th century, musical setting of [[prose]] and [[free verse]] has also been practiced in some [[art music]], though [[popular music]] tends to remain conservative in its retention of [[stanza]]ic forms with or without [[refrain]]s.) A rudimentary example of translating poetry for singing is church [[hymn]]s, such as the German [[chorale]]s translated into English by [[Catherine Winkworth]].{{efn|For another example of poetry translation, including translation of sung texts, see [http://vagalecs.narod.ru/ Rhymes from Russia].}}

Translation of sung texts is generally much more restrictive than translation of poetry, because in the former there is little or no freedom to choose between a versified translation and a translation that dispenses with verse structure. One might modify or omit rhyme in a singing translation, but the assignment of syllables to specific notes in the original musical setting places great challenges on the translator.  There is the option in prose sung texts, less so in verse, of adding or deleting a syllable here and there by subdividing or combining notes, respectively, but even with prose the process is almost like strict verse translation because of the need to stick as closely as possible to the original prosody of the sung melodic line.

Other considerations in writing a singing translation include repetition of words and phrases, the placement of rests and/or punctuation, the quality of vowels sung on high notes, and rhythmic features of the vocal line that may be more natural to the original language than to the target language. A sung translation may be considerably or completely different from the original, thus resulting in a [[contrafactum]].

Translations of sung texts—whether of the above type meant to be sung or of a more or less literal type meant to be read—are also used as aids to audiences, singers and conductors, when a work is being sung in a language not known to them. The most familiar types are translations presented as subtitles or [[surtitles]] projected during [[opera]] performances, those inserted into concert programs, and those that accompany commercial audio CDs of vocal music. In addition, professional and amateur singers often sing works in languages they do not know (or do not know well), and translations are then used to enable them to understand the meaning of the words they are singing.

===Religious texts===
{{Further|Bible translations|Quran translations}}

[[File:Domenico Ghirlandaio - St Jerome in his study.jpg|thumb|left|135px|[[Jerome]], [[patron saint]] of translators and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedists]]]]
An important role in history has been played by translation of religious texts. Such translations may be influenced by tension between the text and the religious values the translators wish to convey. For example, [[Buddhist]] [[monk]]s who translated the [[India]]n [[sutra]]s into [[Chinese language|Chinese]] occasionally adjusted their translations to better reflect [[China]]'s distinct [[culture]], emphasizing notions such as [[filial piety]].

One of the first recorded instances of translation in the West was the rendering of the [[Old Testament]] into [[Greek language|Greek]] in the 3rd century BCE. The translation is known as the "[[Septuagint]]", a name that refers to the supposedly seventy translators (seventy-two, in some versions) who were commissioned to translate the [[Bible]] at [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]]. According to legend, each translator worked in solitary confinement in his own cell, and,  according to legend, all seventy versions proved identical. The ''Septuagint'' became the [[source text]] for later translations into many languages, including [[Latin]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Georgian language|Georgian]].

Still considered one of the greatest translators in history, for having rendered the ''[[Bible]]'' into [[Latin]], is [[Jerome]] (347–420 C.E.), the [[patron saint]] of translators. For centuries the [[Roman Catholic Church]] used his translation (known as the [[Vulgate]]), though even this translation stirred controversy.  By contrast with Jerome's contemporary, [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430 C.E.), who endorsed precise translation, Jerome believed in adaptation, and sometimes invention, in order to more effectively bring across the meaning.  Jerome's colorful Vulgate translation of the Bible includes some crucial instances of "overdetermination".  For example, [[Isaiah]]'s prophecy announcing that the Savior will be born of a virgin, uses the word '''almah'', which is also used to describe the dancing girls at [[Solomon]]'s court, and simply means young and nubile.  Jerome, writes [[Marina Warner]], translates it as ''virgo'', "adding divine authority to the virulent cult of [[sex]]ual disgust that shaped Christian moral theology (the [Moslem] ''[[Quran]]'', free from this linguistic trap, does not connect [[Maryam (name)|Mariam]]/[[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]]'s miraculous nature with moral horror of sex)."  The [[apple]] that [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]], according to Mark Polizzotti, could equally well have been an [[apricot]], [[orange (fruit)|orange]], or [[banana]]; but Jerome liked the [[pun]] ''malus/malum'' (apple/evil}.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marina Warner]], "The Politics of Translation" (a review of [[Kate Briggs]], ''This Little Art'', 2017; [[Mireille Gansel]], translated by [[Ros Schwartz]], 2017; [[Mark Polizzotti]], ''Sympathy for the Traitor:  A Translation Manifesto'', 2018; [[Boyd Tonkin]], ed., ''The 100 Best Novels in Translation'', 2018; [[Clive Scott (linguist)|Clive Scott]], ''The Work of Literary Translation'', 2018), ''[[London Review of Books]]'', vol. 40, no. 19 (11 October 2018), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pope Francis]] has suggested that the phrase "lead us not into temptation", in the [[Lord's Prayer]] found in the [[Gospel of Matthew|Gospels of Matthew]] (the first Gospel, written c. 80–90 C.E.) and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] (the third Gospel, written c. 80–110 C.E.), should more properly be translated, "do not let us fall into temptation", commenting that God does not lead people into temptation—[[Satan]] does.{{efn|MJC Warren, Lecturer in Biblical and Religious Studies, [[University of Sheffield]], points out (more explicitly than Charles McNamara) that Luke gives a shorter version of [[Jesus]]'s Lord's Prayer, leaving off the request that God "deliver us from evil"; that (as Charles McNamara also says) accurate translation is not the question here; and that the Bible records a number of incidents when God commands evil actions, such as that [[Abraham]] kill his only son, [[Isaac]] (whose execution is canceled at the last moment).&lt;ref&gt;MJC Warren, "‘Lead us not into temptation’: why Pope Francis is wrong about the Lord’s Prayer", ''[[The Conversation]]'', December 8, 2017 [https://theconversation.com/lead-us-not-into-temptation-why-pope-francis-is-wrong-about-the-lords-prayer-88886]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  Some important early Christian authors interpreted the Bible's Greek text and [[Jerome]]'s [[Latin Vulgate]] similarly to Pope Francis.  A.J.B. Higgins&lt;ref&gt;A.J.B. Higgins, "'Lead Us Not into Temptation':  Some Latin Variants", ''[[Journal of Theological Studies]]'', 1943.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1943 showed that among the earliest Christian authors, the understanding and even the text of this devotional verse underwent considerable changes.  These ancient writers suggest that, even if the Greek and Latin texts are left unmodified, something like "do not let us fall" could be an acceptable English rendering.  Higgins cited [[Tertullian]], the earliest of the Latin [[Church Fathers]] (c. 155–c. 240 C.E., "do not allow us to be led") and [[Cyprian]] (c. 200–258 C.E., "do not allow us to be led into temptation").  A later author, [[Ambrose]] (C. 340–397 C.E.), followed Cyprian's interpretation.  [[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430), familiar with Jerome's Latin Vulgate rendering, observed that "many people... say it this way:  'and do not allow us to be led into temptation.'"&lt;ref&gt;Charles McNamara, "Lead Us Not into Temptation?  Francis Is Not the First to Question a Key Phrase of the Lord's Prayer", ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'', January 1, 2018.  [https://www.commonwealmagazine.org/lead-us-not-temptation]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 863 C.E. the brothers [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], the [[Byzantine Empire]]'s "Apostles to the Slavs", began translating parts of the [[Bible]] into the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, using the [[Glagolitic script]] that they had devised, based on the [[Greek alphabet]].

The periods preceding and contemporary with the [[Protestant Reformation]] saw translations of the [[Bible]] into [[vernacular]] (local) European languages—a development that contributed to [[Western Christianity]]'s split into [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]] and [[Protestantism]] over disparities between Catholic and Protestant renderings of crucial words and passages (and due to a Protestant-perceived need to reform the Roman Catholic Church).  Lasting effects on the religions, cultures, and languages of their respective countries were exerted by such [[Bible]] translations as [[Martin Luther]]'s into [[German language|German]] (the [[New Testament]], 1522), [[Jakub Wujek]]'s into [[Polish language|Polish]] (1599, as revised by the [[Jesuits]]), and [[William Tyndale]]'s (New Testament, 1526 and revisions) and the ''[[King James Version]]'' into [[English language|English]] (1611). 
[[File:Moses (Michaelangelo - San Pietro in Vincoli - Rome).jpg|thumb|left|140px|right|Mistranslation: [[Michelangelo]]'s horned [[Moses]]]]
Efforts to translate the Bible into English had their [[martyr]]s. [[William Tyndale]] (c. 1494–1536) was convicted of [[heresy]] at [[Antwerp]], was strangled to death while tied at the stake, and then his dead body was burned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Farris |first=Michael |title=From Tyndale to Madison |year=2007 |page=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier, [[John Wycliffe]] (c. mid-1320s – 1384) had managed to die a natural death, but 30 years later the [[Council of Constance]] in 1415 declared him a heretic and decreed that his works and earthly remains should be burned; the order, confirmed by [[Pope Martin V]], was carried out in 1428, and Wycliffe's corpse was exhumed and burned and the ashes cast into the [[River Swift]].  Debate and religious [[schism]] over different translations of religious texts continue, as demonstrated by, for example, the [[King James Only movement]].

A famous ''mistranslation'' of a [[Biblical]] text is the rendering of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] word {{lang|he|קֶרֶן|rtl=yes}} (''keren''), which has several meanings, as "horn" in a context where it more plausibly means "beam of light":  as a result, for centuries artists, including sculptor [[Michelangelo]], have rendered [[Moses|Moses the Lawgiver]] with horns growing from his forehead.
[[File:Chinese quran.jpg|thumb|100px|[[Chinese language|Chinese]] translation, verses 33–34 of ''Quran'''s [[Ya Sin|''surah'' (chapter) 36]]]]
Such fallibility of the translation process has contributed to the [[Islamic]] world's ambivalence about translating the ''[[Quran]]'' (also spelled ''Koran'') from the original [[Arabic]], as received by the prophet [[Muhammad]] from [[Allah]] (God) through the angel [[Gabriel]] incrementally between 609 and 632 C.E., the year of Muhammad's death.  During prayers, the ''Quran'', as the miraculous and inimitable word of Allah, is recited only in Arabic.  However, as of 1936, it had been translated into at least 102 languages.&lt;ref name = fatani&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first =Afnan|last = Fatani|title =Translation and the Qur'an|editor-link =Oliver Leaman|editor-first = Oliver| editor-last = Leaman|encyclopedia=The Qur'an:  An Encyclopaedia|publisher = Routledge|date = 2006|pages = 657–669|isbn = 978-0415775298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fundamental difficulty in translating the ''Quran'' accurately stems from the fact that an Arabic word, like a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] word, may have a [[Polysemy|range of meanings]], depending on [[Context (language use)|context]].  This is said to be a linguistic feature, particularly of all [[Semitic languages]], that adds to the usual similar difficulties encountered in translating between any two languages.&lt;ref name = fatani/&gt;  There is always an element of human judgment—of interpretation—involved in understanding and translating a text.  Muslims regard any translation of the ''Quran'' as but one possible interpretation of the [[Classical Arabic|Quranic (Classical) Arabic]] text, and not as a full equivalent of that divinely communicated original.  Hence such a translation is often called an "interpretation" rather than a translation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malise Ruthven]], ''Islam in the World'', Granta, 2006, p. 90, {{ISBN|978-1-86207-906-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

To complicate matters further, as with other languages, the meanings and usages of some expressions have changed ''over time'', between the Classical Arabic of the ''Quran'', and modern Arabic.  Thus a modern Arabic speaker may misinterpret the meaning of a word or passage in the ''Quran''.  Moreover, the interpretation of a Quranic passage will also depend on the historic context of Muhammad's life and of his early community.  Properly researching that context requires a detailed knowledge of ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[Prophetic biography|sirah]]'', which are themselves vast and complex texts.  Hence, analogously to the translating of [[Translation#Chinese literature|Chinese literature]], an attempt at an accurate translation of the ''Quran'' requires a knowledge not only of the Arabic language and of the [[Target language (translation)|target language]], including their respective evolutions, but also a deep understanding of the two [[culture]]s involved.

== Technical translation ==
{{main|Technical translation}}
[[Technical translation]] renders documents such as manuals, instruction sheets, internal memos, minutes, financial reports, and other documents for a limited audience (who are directly affected by the document) and whose useful life is often limited.  Thus, a user guide for a particular model of refrigerator is useful only for the owner of the refrigerator, and will remain useful only as long as that refrigerator model is in use.  Similarly, software documentation generally pertains to a particular software, whose applications are used only by a certain class of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Byrne |first=Jody|year=2006 |title=Technical Translation: Usability Strategies for Translating Technical Documentation |publisher=Springer |location=Dordrecht}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Multiple'' tests of artificial-intelligence efficacy are needed because, "just as there is no single test of [[Athletics (physical culture)|athletic]] prowess, there cannot be one ultimate test of [[intelligence]]."  One such test, a "Construction Challenge", would test perception and physical action—"two important elements of intelligent behavior that were entirely absent from the original [[Turing test]]."  Another proposal has been to give machines the same standardized tests of science and other disciplines that schoolchildren take.  A so far insuperable stumbling block to artificial intelligence is an incapacity for reliable [[disambiguation]].  "[V]irtually every sentence [that people generate] is [[ambiguity|ambiguous]], often in multiple ways."  A prominent example is known as the "pronoun disambiguation problem":  a machine has no way of determining to whom or what a [[pronoun]] in a sentence—such as "he", "she" or "it"—refers.

{{Contains Vietnamese text}}
The '''Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation''' ({{lang-vi|Hội Bảo Tồn Di Sản Chữ Nôm}}; [[Hán Nôm]]: {{vi-nom|會保存遺産喃}}), shortened as the '''Nôm Foundation'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|work=[[Library of Congress]] Name Authority File|url=http://id.loc.gov/authorities/names/nr2002015127.html|accessdate=August 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and abbreviated as '''VNPF''', is an American nonprofit agency for [[language preservation]] headquartered in [[Cary, North Carolina]], with an office in [[Hanoi]], [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name="vnpf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Contact|work=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|url=http://nomfoundation.org/Contact|accessdate=August 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1999, it has been engaging in the preservation of [[Chữ Nôm]] script (an ancient, [[logographic]], [[Chinese character]]-based script once used by the [[Vietnamese people]] to write their language) remained in manuscripts, [[inscription]]s and [[woodcut|woodblock]]s.&lt;ref name="vnpf1"&gt;{{cite web|title=About the VNPF|work=Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation|url=http://nomfoundation.org/|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="upenn"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balaban|first=John|title=Update on Nom|work=Language Log, Linguistic Data Consortium, the [[University of Pennsylvania]]|url=http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=5212|date=July 16, 2013|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foundation==
The preservation of Chữ Nôm practiced by the Foundation involves different approaches, such as the electronic font carving, ideograms entered into [[Unicode]] and the International Standard (regulated by [[ISO]]), [[digitization]] for displaying Nôm on the [[Internet]] and the revival of ancient works in [[literature]], history, culture, [[music]]s and the [[arts]] (e.g. the [[chamber music]] called [[Ca trù]]).{{r|niu}} 

With the help of voluntary [[linguist]]s, [[lexicographer]]s and computer professionals from many part of the world, the VNPF publishes Nôm dictionary in both print edition and digital format, making it the first Nôm dictionary in [[TrueType]].{{r|vnpf1}}&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Balaban|first=John|title=The Hán-Nôm Special Collection Digitization Project|work=Southeast Asia Digital Library, [[Northern Illinois University]]|url=http://sea.lib.niu.edu/project/about_hannom|accessdate=August 4, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812213937/http://sea.lib.niu.edu/project/about_hannom|archive-date=August 12, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While granting scholarships to American and Vietnamese students who intend to research this subject,{{r|vnpf1}} the VNPF also sponsored two international Nôm conferences and represented Nôm script at the international meetings held by the [[Ideographic Rapporteur Group]].{{r|niu}}{{r|lse}}

==Projects==
There has been a scheme called ''the Digitization Project of the Hán-Nôm Special Collection'' cooperatively implemented by the Vietnamese Nôm Preservation Foundation and the [[National Library of Vietnam]]. In 2006, a Memorandum was signed by the VNPF, enabling it to build a digital library based on the existing collections in the National Library which stores world's most ancient scripts written in Hán Nôm.{{r|niu}} Through the resources from the National Library, the VNPF had digitized more than 2000 Hán Nôm texts till 2013.{{r|upenn}}

Meanwhile, the VNPF has been directing another project to digitize the [[Thắng Nghiêm Temple]] ({{lang-vi|Chùa Thắng Nghiêm|links=no}}; Hán Nôm: {{vi-nom|寺勝嚴}}) near [[Hanoi]]. Constructed in the early 11th century under an imperial order, it is an important historical site for the Asian [[Buddhism]]. The project will be completed by 2014, bringing a web database of the full record from the Temple, including manuscripts, epigraphical materials and visual heritages in Chữ Nôm. Additionally, the building structure and [[iconographical]] ideas of the Thắng Nghiêm Temple will be shown in a photographic overview.&lt;ref name="ug"&gt;{{cite web|last=Schmid|first=D.

Receiving funds from private donators, the Chino Cienega Foundation in [[California]], the International Music and Arts Foundation in [[Liechtenstein]], [[North Carolina State University]] and the [[U.S. Embassy in Hanoi]], this project is aimed at recording Vietnamese Buddhism, offering historical documents of the Temple, opening a path for further temple digitization in the future and letting the materials to be globally accessible.{{r|ug}}
