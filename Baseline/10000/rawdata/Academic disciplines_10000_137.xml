[[File:Bertillon, Alphonse, fiche anthropométrique recto-verso.jpg|thumb|Anthropometric data sheet (both sides) of [[Alphonse Bertillon]], a pioneer in anthropological criminology]]
'''Anthropological criminology''' (sometimes referred to as '''criminal anthropology''', literally a combination of the study of the [[human]] species and the study of [[crime|criminals]]) is a field of [[offender profiling]], based on perceived links between the nature of a [[crime]] and the personality or physical appearance of the offender. Although similar to [[physiognomy]] and [[phrenology]], the term "criminal [[anthropology]]" is generally reserved for the works of the [[Italian school of criminology]] of the late 19th century ([[Cesare Lombroso]], [[Enrico Ferri]], [[Raffaele Garofalo]]). Lombroso thought that criminals were born with inferior physiological differences which were detectable. He popularized the notion of "born criminal" and thought that criminality was an [[atavism]] or [[hereditary]] disposition. His central idea was to locate crime completely within the individual and utterly divorce it from the surrounding social conditions and structures. A founder of the [[Positivist school]] of criminology, Lombroso opposed the social positivism developed by the [[Chicago school (sociology)|Chicago school]] and [[environmental criminology]].

On the other hand, [[Alphonse Bertillon]] (1853&amp;ndash;1914) created a [[mugshot]] identification system for criminals prior to the invention of [[fingerprinting]]. [[Hans Gross]] (1847&amp;ndash;1915), leading worker in the field of [[criminology]] was also involved in the development of the theory.&lt;ref name="here"&gt;''Anthropological Criminology, North Carolina Wesleyan College, retrieved from [http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm here] on March 10, 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061009044430/http://faculty.ncwc.edu/toconnor/301/301lect03.htm |date=October 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social Darwinism ==
The theory of anthropological criminology was influenced heavily by the ideas of [[Charles Darwin]] (1809–1882). However, the influences came mainly from philosophy derived from Darwin's [[theory of evolution]], specifically that some species were morally superior to others. This idea was in fact spawned by [[Social Darwinism]], but nevertheless formed a critical part of anthropological criminology.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt; The work of Cesare Lombroso was continued by Social Darwinists in the [[United States]] between 1881 and 1911.

==The theory==

In the 19th century, Cesare Lombroso and his followers, performed autopsies on criminals and declared that they had discovered similarities between the [[physiologies]] of the bodies and those of "primitive humans", monkeys and apes. Most of these similarities involved receding foreheads, height, head shape and size, and based on these Lombroso postulated the theory of the ‘born criminal’. Lombroso also declared that the female offender was worse than the male, as they had strong masculine characteristics.

Lombroso outlined 14 physiognomic characteristics which he and his followers believed to be common in all criminals: unusually short or tall height; small head, but large face; fleshy lips, but thin upper lip; protuberances (bumps) on head, in back of head and around ear; wrinkles on forehead and face; large sinus cavities or bumpy face; tattoos on body; receding hairline; bumps on head, particularly above left ear; large incisors; bushy eyebrows, tending to meet across nose; large eye sockets, but deep-set eyes; beaked or flat nose; strong jaw line; small and sloping forehead; small or weak chin; thin neck; sloping shoulders, but large chest; large, protruding ears; long arms; high cheek bones; pointy or snubbed fingers or toes.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Lombroso published several works regarding his work, ''L'Uomo Delinquente'', ''L'Homme Criminel (The Criminal Man)'', ''The Female Offender'' (original titled ''Criminal Woman, the Prostitute, and the Normal Woman'') and ''Criminal Man, According to the Classification of Cesare Lombroso''.

==Rejection==

During Lombroso's life, British scientist [[Charles Buckman Goring]] (1870&amp;ndash;1919) was also working in the same area, and concluded that there were no noticeable physiological differences between law-abiding people and those who committed crimes. Maurice Parmelee, seen as the founder of modern criminology in America, also began to reject the theory of anthropological criminology in 1911, which led to its eventual withdrawal from the field of accepted criminology research.

==Modern times==

Despite general rejection of Lombroso's theories, anthropological criminology still finds a place of sort in modern criminal profiling. Historically (particularly in the 1930s) criminal anthropology had been associated somewhat with [[eugenics]] as the idea of a physiological flaw in the human race was often associated with plans to remove such flaws. This was found particularly in America, with the American Eugenics Movement between 1907 and 1939, and the [[Anti-miscegenation laws]], and also in Germany during the [[Third Reich]] where 250,000 mentally disabled Germans were killed.&lt;ref name="here"/&gt;

Criminal anthropology, and the closely related study of Physiognomy, have also found their way into studies of [[social psychology]] and [[forensic psychology]]. Studies into the nature of [[twins]] also combines aspects of criminal anthropology, as some studies reveal that identical twins share a likelihood of criminal activities more so than non-identical twins. Lombroso's theories are also found in studies of [[Galvanic skin response]] and [[XYY syndrome|XYY chromosome syndrome]].

The '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute''', or '''AARI''' ({{lang-ru|Арктический и антарктический научно-исследовательский институт}}, abbreviated as '''ААНИИ''') is the oldest and largest [[Russia]]n research institute in the field of comprehensive studies of [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctica]]. It is located in [[Saint Petersburg]]. 

The AARI has numerous departments, such as those of [[oceanography]], [[glaciology]], [[meteorology]], [[hydrology]] or Arctic river mouths and water resources, [[geophysics]], polar geography, and others. It also has its own computer center, ice research laboratory, experimental workshops, and a museum (the [[Arctic and Antarctic Museum]]). 

Scientists, such as [[Alexander Karpinsky]], [[Alexander Fersman]], [[Yuly Shokalsky]], [[Nikolai Mikhailovich Knipovich|Nikolai Knipovich]], [[Lev Berg]], [[Otto Schmidt]], [[Rudolf Samoylovich]], [[Professor Vize|Vladimir Vize]], [[Nikolai Zubov]], [[Pyotr Shirshov]], [[Nikolai Urvantsev]], and [[Yakov Gakkel]] have all made their valuable contributions to the work of the AARI.

Throughout its history, the AARI has organized more than a thousand Arctic expeditions, including dozens of high-latitude aerial expeditions, which transported 34(?) manned [[Soviet and Russian manned drifting ice stations|drifting ice station]]s ''Severniy Polyus'' ("Северный полюс", or North Pole) to Central Arctic. 
==History==
The AARI was founded on 3 March 1920 as the '''Northern Research and Trade Expedition''' (Северная научно-промысловая экспедиция) under the Scientific and Technical Department of the [[Vesenkha|All-Union Council of State Economy]]. In 1925, the expedition was reorganized into the '''Institute of Northern Studies''' (Институт по изучению Севера) and five years later - into the '''All-Union Arctic Institute''' (Всесоюзный арктический институт). In 1932, the institute was integrated into the [[Chief Directorate of the Northern Sea Route]] (Главное управление Северного морского пути). In 1948 the Arctic Geology Research Institute (Научно-исследовательский институт геологии Арктики, or НИИГА) was established on the basis of the [[geology]] department of the All-Union Arctic Institute, which would subordinate to the [[Ministry of Geology of the USSR]]. 

In 1955, the AARI participated in the organization of Antarctic research. In 1958, it began to organize and lead all of the Soviet Antarctic expeditions, which would later make many geographic discoveries, and in the same year the [[All-Union]] Arctic Institute was renamed '''Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute'''. In 1963, the AARI was incorporated into the [[Hydrometeorological Service of the USSR|Chief Administration of the Hydrometeorological Service]] (Главное управление Гидрометеослужбы) under the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]] (now [[Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring of Russia]]).

In 1967, AARI was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]]. In 1968, the institute engaged in research of the areas of the [[Atlantic Ocean]] contiguous to the Arctic and Antarctica.

The '''argument from reason''' is an argument against [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] and for the [[existence of God]] (or at least a [[supernatural]] being that is the source of human reason). The best-known defender of the argument is [[C. S. Lewis]]. Lewis first defended the argument at length in his 1947 book, ''[[Miracles (book)|Miracles: A Preliminary Study]]''. In the second edition of ''Miracles'' (1960), Lewis substantially revised and expanded the argument.

Contemporary defenders of the argument from reason include [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Victor Reppert]] and [[William Harker]].

==The argument==

Methodological naturalism is the view that nature as studied by the natural sciences is all that exists. Naturalists deny the existence of a supernatural God, souls, an afterlife, or anything supernatural. Nothing exists outside or beyond the physical universe.

The argument from reason seeks to show that naturalism is self-refuting, or otherwise false and indefensible.

According to Lewis,

{{blockquote|One absolutely central inconsistency ruins [the naturalistic worldview].... The whole picture professes to depend on inferences from observed facts. Unless inference is valid, the whole picture disappears.... [U]nless Reason is an absolute--all is in ruins. Yet those who ask me to believe this world picture also ask me to believe that Reason is simply the unforeseen and unintended by-product of mindless matter at one stage of its endless and aimless becoming. Here is flat contradiction. They ask me at the same moment to accept a conclusion and to discredit the only testimony on which that conclusion can be based.|sign=C. S. Lewis, "Is Theology Poetry?", ''[[The Weight of Glory and Other Addresses]]''}}

More precisely, Lewis's argument from reason can be stated as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. No belief is rationally inferred if it can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Reasoning requires insight into logical relations. A process of reasoning (P therefore Q) is rational only if the reasoner sees that Q follows from, or is supported by, P, and accepts Q on that basis. Thus, reasoning is trustworthy (or "valid", as Lewis sometimes says) only if it involves a special kind of causality, namely, rational insight into logical implication or evidential support. If a bit of reasoning can be fully explained by nonrational causes, such as fibers firing in the brain or a bump on the head, then the reasoning is not reliable, and cannot yield knowledge. Consider this example: Person A refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because he had a bad childhood experience with dogs. Person B refuses to go near the neighbor’s dog because one month ago he saw it attack someone. Both have given a reason for staying away from the dog, but person A’s reason is the result of nonrational causes, while person B has given an explanation for his behavior following from rational inference (animals exhibit patterns of behavior; these patterns are likely to be repeated; this dog has exhibited aggression towards someone who approached it; there is a good chance that the dog may exhibit the same behavior towards me if I approach it). Consider a second example: person A says that he is afraid to climb to the 8th story of a bank building because he and humans in general have a natural fear of heights resulting from the processes of evolution and natural selection. He has given an explanation of his fear, but since his fear results from nonrational causes (natural selection), his argument does not follow from logical inference.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
2. If naturalism is true, then all beliefs can be fully explained in terms of nonrational causes. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Support: Naturalism holds that nature is all that exists, and that all events in nature can in principle be explained without invoking supernatural or other nonnatural causes. Standardly, naturalists claim that all events must have physical causes, and that human thoughts can ultimately be explained in terms of material causes or physical events (such as neurochemical events in the brain) that are nonrational.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
3. Therefore, if naturalism is true, then no belief is rationally inferred (from 1 and 2). 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
4. We have good reason to accept naturalism only if it can be rationally inferred from good evidence. 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;5. Therefore, there is not, and cannot be, good reason to accept naturalism.&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Victor Reppert, author of ''C.S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea''. Taken from his blog at: http://dangerousidea.blogspot.com/2006/07/argument-from-reason-and-lewiss-post.html"&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In short, naturalism undercuts itself. If naturalism is true, then we cannot sensibly believe it or virtually anything else.

In some versions of the argument from reason, Lewis extends the argument to defend a further conclusion: that human reason depends on an eternal, self-existent rational Being (God). This extension of the argument from reason states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;1. Since everything in nature can be wholly explained in terms of nonrational causes, human reason (more precisely, the power of drawing conclusions based solely on the rational cause of logical insight) must have a source outside of nature.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;2. If human reason came from non-reason it would lose all rational credentials and would cease to be reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;3. So, human reason cannot come from non-reason (from 2).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;4. So human reason must come from a source outside nature that is itself rational (from 1 and 3).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;5. This supernatural source of reason may itself be dependent on some further source of reason, but a chain of such dependent sources cannot go on forever. Eventually, we must reason back to the existence of eternal, non-dependent source of human reason.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;6. Therefore, there exists an eternal, self-existent, rational Being who is the ultimate source of human reason. This Being we call God (from 4-5). (Lewis, ''Miracles'', chap. 4)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticisms==

On 2 February 1948, Oxford philosopher [[Elizabeth Anscombe]] read a paper to the Oxford [[Socratic Club]] criticizing the version of the argument from reason contained in the third chapter of Lewis's ''Miracles''.

Her first criticism was against the use of the word "irrational" by Lewis (Anscombe 1981: 225-26). Her point was that there is an important difference between irrational causes of belief, such as wishful thinking, and nonrational causes, such as neurons firing in the brain, that do not obviously lead to faulty reasoning. Lewis accepted the criticism and amended the argument, basing it on the concept of nonrational causes of belief (as in the version provided in this article).

Anscombe's second criticism questioned the intelligibility of Lewis's intended contrast between "valid" and "invalid" reasoning. She wrote: "What ''can'' you mean by 'valid' beyond what would be indicated by the explanation you would give for distinguishing between valid and invalid, and what in the naturalistic hypothesis prevents that explanation from being given and from meaning what it does?" (Anscombe 1981: 226) Her point is that it makes no sense to contrast "valid" and "invalid" reasoning unless it is possible for some forms of reasoning to be valid. Lewis later conceded (Anscombe 1981: 231) that "valid" was a bad word for what he had in mind. Lewis didn't mean to suggest that if naturalism is true, no arguments can be given in which the conclusions follow logically from the premises. What he meant is that a process of reasoning is "veridical", that is, reliable as a method of pursuing knowledge and truth, only if it cannot be entirely explained by nonrational causes.

Anscombe's third objection was that Lewis failed to distinguish between different senses of the terms "why", "because", and "explanation", and that what counts as a "full" explanation varies by context (Anscombe 1981: 227-31).  In the context of ordinary life, "because he wants a cup of tea" may count as a perfectly satisfactory explanation of why Peter is boiling water. Yet such a purposive explanation would not count as a full explanation (or an explanation at all) in the context of physics or biochemistry. Lewis accepted this criticism, and created a revised version of the argument in which the distinction between "because" in the sense of physical causality, and "because" in the sense of evidential support, became the central point of the argument. (This is the version described in this article.)&lt;ref&gt;For Anscombe's critical appraisal of Lewis's revised argument from reason, see Elizabeth Anscombe, "C. S. Lewis's Rewrite of Chapter III of ''Miracles''", in Roger White, Judith Wolfe, and Brendan N. Wolfe, eds., ''C. S. Lewis and His Circle: Essays and Memoirs from the Oxford C. S. Lewis Society''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2015, pp. 15-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

More recent critics have argued that Lewis's argument at best refutes only strict forms of naturalism that seek to explain everything in terms ultimately reducible to physics or purely mechanistic causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., David Kyle Johnson, "Con: Naturalism Undefeated," in Gregory Bassham, ed. ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 95-96.&lt;/ref&gt; So-called "broad" naturalists that see consciousness as an "emergent" non-physical property of complex brains would agree with Lewis that different levels or types of causation exist in nature, and that rational inferences are not fully explainable by nonrational causes.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Charles Taliaferro, "On Naturalism," in Robert MacSwain and Michael Wards, eds. ''The Cambridge Companion to C. S. Lewis''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other critics have objected that Lewis's argument from reason fails because the causal origins of beliefs are often irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational, justified, warranted, etc. Anscombe, for example, argues that "if a man has reasons, and they are good reasons, and they are genuinely his reasons, for thinking something—then his thought is rational, whatever causal statements we make about him" (Anscombe 1981: 229). On many widely accepted theories of knowledge and justification, questions of how beliefs were ultimately caused (e.g., at the level of brain neurochemistry) are viewed as irrelevant to whether those beliefs are rational or justified. Some defenders of Lewis claim that this objection misses the mark, because his argument is directed at what he calls the "veridicalness" of acts of reasoning (i.e., whether reasoning connects us with objective reality or truth), rather than with whether any inferred beliefs can be rational or justified in a materialistic world.

==Similar views by other thinkers==
Philosophers such as [[Victor Reppert]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor Reppert, ''C. S. Lewis's Dangerous Idea: In Defense of the Argument from'' ''Reason''. Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 2003; Victor Reppert, "The Argument from Reason Defended," in Gregory Bassham, ed., ''C. S. Lewis's Christian Apologetics: Pro and Con''. Leiden: Brill Rodopi, 2015, pp. 75-89.&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Hasker]]&lt;ref&gt;William Hasker, ''The Emergent Self''. Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1999, chap. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Alvin Plantinga]]&lt;ref&gt;Alvin Plantinga, ''Where the Conflict Really Lies: Science, Religion, and Naturalism''. New York: Oxford University Press, 2011, chap. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; have expanded on the argument from reason, and credit C.S. Lewis as an important influence on their thinking.

Lewis never claimed that he invented the argument from reason; in fact, he refers to it as a "venerable philosophical chestnut."&lt;ref&gt;C. S. Lewis, ''Collected Letters'', vol. 2, Walter Hooper ed. San Francisco: HarperSanFrancisco, 2004, p. 715.&lt;/ref&gt; Early versions of the argument occur in the works of Arthur Balfour (see, e.g., ''The Foundations of Belief'', 1879, chap. 13) and G.K. Chesterton. In Chesterton's 1908 book ''Orthodoxy'', in a chapter titled "The Suicide of Thought", he writes of the "great and possible peril . . . that the human intellect is free to destroy itself....It is idle to talk always of the alternative of reason and faith. It is an act of faith to assert that our thoughts have any relation to reality at all. If you are merely a sceptic, you must sooner or later ask yourself the question, "Why should anything go right; even observation and deduction? Why should not good logic be as misleading as bad logic? They are both movements in the brain of a bewildered ape?"&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Orthodoxy''. New York: Iamge Books, 1959, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Chesterton asserts that the argument is a fundamental, if unstated, tenet of Thomism in his 1933 book ''St. Thomas Aquinas: "The Dumb Ox"'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;Thus, even those who appreciate the metaphysical depth of Thomism in other matters have expressed surprise that he does not deal at all with what many now think the main metaphysical question; whether we can prove that the primary act of recognition of any reality is real. The answer is that St. Thomas recognised instantly, what so many modern sceptics have begun to suspect rather laboriously; that a man must either answer that question in the affirmative, or else never answer any question, never ask any question, never even exist intellectually, to answer or to ask. I suppose it is true in a sense that a man can be a fundamental sceptic, but he cannot be anything else: certainly not even a defender of fundamental scepticism. If a man feels that all the movements of his own mind are meaningless, then his mind is meaningless, and he is meaningless; and it does not mean anything to attempt to discover his meaning. Most fundamental sceptics appear to survive, because they are not consistently sceptical and not at all fundamental. They will first deny everything and then admit something, if for the sake of argument--or often rather of attack without argument. I saw an almost startling example of this essential frivolity in a professor of final scepticism, in a paper the other day. A man wrote to say that he accepted nothing but Solipsism, and added that he had often wondered it was not a more common philosophy. Now Solipsism simply means that a man believes in his own existence, but not in anybody or anything else. And it never struck this simple sophist, that if his philosophy was true, there obviously were no other philosophers to profess it.&lt;ref&gt;G. K. Chesterton, ''Thomas Aquinas: The Dumb Ox''. New York: Image Books, 1933, pp. 148-49.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''Miracles'', Lewis himself quotes J. B. S. Haldane, who appeals to a similar line of reasoning in his 1927 book, ''Possible Worlds'': "If my mental processes are determined wholly by the motions of atoms in my brain, I have no reason to suppose that my beliefs are true ... and hence I have no reason for supposing my brain to be composed of atoms."&lt;ref&gt;J. B. S. Haldane, ''Possible Worlds and Other Essays''. London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1929, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other versions of the argument from reason occur in [[C.E.M. Joad]]'s ''Guide to Modern Philosophy'' (London: Faber, 1933, pp.&amp;nbsp;58–59), Richard Taylor's ''Metaphysics'' (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 3rd ed., 1983, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–05), and [[J. P. Moreland]]'s ''Scaling the Secular City: A Defense of Christianity'' (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker, 1987, chap. 3).

'''Arts and letters''' is a traditional term for the [[fine arts]] and [[literature]] considered together. The category defined as "arts and letters" may also include the [[performing arts]], [[visual arts]], or [[liberal arts]].

==History==
By the late 19th century the term was used to name a few arts-related institutions in the [[United States]]. A [[subscription]]-based Theatre of Arts and Letters opened in [[New York City|New York]] in 1892, but closed within a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

| jstor=3204417
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] was founded in 1904.

The term has also figured in [[higher education]]. For example, by 1889 students at [[Swarthmore College]] were sorted into two categories of study: "Arts and Letters" or "Science and Engineering."&lt;ref&gt;''Twenty-first Annual Catalogue of Swarthmore College, Swarthmore, Pa., 1889-90''. Philadelphia: Press of Friends' Book Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, course requirements at the University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences have included a "sector" (category) called "Arts and Letters." The college defines the sector as including "visual arts, literature and music, together with the criticism surrounding them."&lt;ref&gt;University of Pennsylvania College of Arts and Sciences, ''The College Curriculum''  http://www.college.upenn.edu/curriculum/2010/sectors.php, accessed 17 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2534">'''Autassassinophilia''' is a [[paraphilia]] in which a person is [[sexual arousal|sexually aroused]] by the risk of being killed. The [[sexual fetishism|fetish]] may overlap with some other fetishes that risk one's life, such as those involving drowning or choking. This does not necessarily mean the person must actually be in a life-threatening situation, for many are aroused from dreams and fantasies of such.
[[File:Joe Weiss 1957 Gang Girl.jpg|thumb]]

The term was introduced by [[John Money]] who also defined [[erotophonophilia]] as the "reciprocal condition" in which one is aroused by "stage-managing and carrying out the murder of an unsuspecting sexual partner". Money classified both these paraphilias as "of the sacrificial/expiatory type". These concepts, especially their imperfect reciprocity, were criticized by [[Lisa Downing]] who wrote that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The autassassinophiliac, for Money, is more interested in his orgasm than in his death, resulting in a compulsion to 'stage manage the ''possibility'' rather than the ''actuality'' of his end at the hands of another person. The erotophonophiliac, on the other hand, is driven by the actualization of the other's death and &amp;ndash; crucially &amp;ndash; this other must be unaware of the would-be killer's intentions. These definitions, then, effectively preclude reciprocity and are constructed here in such a way as to prevent the possibility of consent. The sexologist, it seems, is incapable of imagining mutuality in this context. [...] The imagined pact is used here as an incentive to the would-be libertarian to support the suppression of paraphilia and the conversion of a death-related desire to a life-giving form."&lt;ref&gt;Lisa Downing, "Eros and Thanatos in European and American Sexology" in Kate Fisher, Sarah Toulalan (eds.)

'''Bilingual education''' involves teaching academic content in two languages, in a native and secondary language with varying amounts of each language used in accordance with the program model.Bilingual education refers to the utilization of two languages as means of instruction for students and considered part of or the entire school curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/curriculum_handbook/413/chapters/Bilingual_Education@_Effective_Programming_for_Language-Minority_Students.aspx|title=Bilingual Education: Effective Programming for Language-Minority Students|last=ASCD|website=ascd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bilingual education program models==
The following are several different types of bilingual education program models:
*[[Transitional bilingual education|Transitional Bilingual Education]]. This involves education in a child's native language, typically for no more than three years, to ensure that students do not fall behind in content areas like mathematics, science, and social studies while they are learning English. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. The goal is to help students transition to mainstream, English-only classrooms as quickly as possible, and the linguistic goal of such programs is English acquisition only. In a transitional bilingual program, the student's primary language is used as a vehicle to develop literacy skills and acquire academic knowledge. It is used to develop literacy and academic skills in the primary language
* '''Two-Way''' or '''Dual Language Immersion''' Bilingual Education. Dual Language or Two-Way Immersion education refers to programs that provide grade-level content and literacy instruction to all students through two languages, English and a partner language. These programs are designed to help native and non-native English speakers become bilingual and biliterate. There are four main types of dual language programs, these programs refer to how a student would best learn with Dual Language Immersion based on their previous language skills.
**'''Developmental, or maintenance bilingual programs.''' These programs enroll students who are native speakers of the partner language to learn English.
**'''Bilingual immersion programs.''' This program enrolls both native English speaker and native speakers of the partner language.
**'''Foreign language Immersion.''' This program primarily enrolls students who speak English as their native language.
**'''Heritage language programs.''' These programs enroll students who primarily dominant in english, but a close relative (parents, grandparents) speak the partner language.
**There are two basic models for Dual Language Immersion The first model is '''90/10 model'''. The two-way bilingual immersion program has 90% of the instructions in grade K-1 in minority language which is less supported by the broader society and 10% in the majority language . This proportion gradually changes in the majority language until the curriculum is equally divided in both languages by 5th grade.  The two-way bilingual immersion program is based on the principle of clear curriculum separation of the two languages of instruction. Teachers do not repeat or translate the subject matter in second language but strengthen concepts taught in one language across the two languages in a spiral curriculum in order to provide cognitive challenge(Thomas &amp; Collier. 1997). The languages of instructions are alternated by theme or content area.  This type of immersion is required to develop the dual language proficiency, as social language can be mastered in couple of years, but a higher level of competency is required to read social studies texts or solve mathematics word problems, roughly around 5 to 7 years (Collier, 1987). The goal of gradually increasing the majority of the language is for instruction to become 50% of English and 50% of the partner language. The second model is the '''50/50 model'''. In the 50/50 model English and the partner language are used equally throughout the program.

The United States Congress introduced the Bilingual Act in 1968 defining bilingual education’s term program. This program of instruction is intended for children who are not fully proficient in the English language. Instructions are given so pupils can achieve the necessary competence in English as well as their native languages taking into consideration the children’s cultural heritage. This could be integrated into the subjects or courses of study enabling the students to grow effectively throughout the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://education.uslegal.com/bilingualism/landmark-legislation/bilingual-education-act-1968/|title=Bilingual Education Act (1968) – Education|last=Inc.|first=US Legal|website=education.uslegal.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Elementary and Secondary Education Act (1968) was another meaningful measure for bilingual education. Title VII (Bilingual Education Act) created federal guidelines for bilingual education. The decree recognized the “''Special educational needs of the large numbers children of limited English-speaking ability in the United States''.” Said Enactment specified the federal government’s obligation to provide subsidy for creative bilingual programs. Title VII was amended many times since its introduction. The decree became part of the America Schools Act in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/transitional-bilingual-education-programs-pros-cons.html|title=Transitional Bilingual Education Programs: Pros &amp; Cons {{!}} Study.com|work=Study.com|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual Immersion classrooms encourage students but with the permission it may be enthusiastic &amp;' native language development, making an important contribution to heritage language maintenance and allows language minority students to remain in classrooms with their native English-speaking peers, resulting in linguistic and socio-cultural advantages (Christian, 1996b). As of May 2005, there were 317 dual immersion programs operating in elementary schools in the United States in 10 different languages(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005).

Dual Language programs are less common in US schools, although research indicates they are extremely effective in helping students learn English well and aiding the long-term performance of English learners in school. Native English speakers benefit by learning a second language. English language learners (ELLs) are not segregated from their peers.&lt;ref&gt;(Center for Applied Linguistics, 2005; Thomas &amp; Collier, 1997; Lindholm-Leary, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; These students are taught in their mother tongue yet still in the typical 'American' classroom they need to be in, for both cognitive and social benefits. 
* Another form of Bilingual Education is a type of '''Dual Language''' program that has students study in two different ways: 1) A variety of academic subjects are taught in the students' second language, with specially trained bilingual teachers who can understand students when they ask questions in their native language, but always answer in the second language; and 2) Native language literacy classes improve students' writing and higher-order language skills in their first language. Research has shown that many of the skills learned in the native language can be transferred easily to the second language later. In this type of program, the native language classes do not teach academic subjects. The second-language classes are content-based, rather than grammar-based, so students learn all of their academic subjects in the second language.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dlenm.org/what-is-dual-language-education.aspx|title=What is Dual Language Education?|website=dlenm.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dual language is a type of bilingual education where students learn about reading and writing in two languages. In the United States, majority of programs are English and Spanish but new partner languages have emerged lately such as Japanese, Korean, French, Mandarin, and Arabic. The concept of Dual Language promotes bilingualism, improved awareness of cultural diversity, and higher levels of academic achievement by means of lessons in two languages.&lt;ref name="What is Dual Language Education"/&gt; 
* '''Late-Exit''' or '''Developmental''' Bilingual Education. Education is in the child's native language for an extended duration, accompanied by education in English. The goal is to develop literacy in the child's native language first, and transfer these skills to the second language. This education is ideal for many English learning students, but in many instances the resources for such education are not available.

==Myths surrounding bilingual education==
Many myths and much prejudice has grown around bilingual education. Researchers from the UK and Poland have listed the most entrenched misconceptions:&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paradowski MB, Bator A |title=Perceived effectiveness of language acquisition in the process of multilingual upbringing by parents of different nationalities  |journal=International Journal of Bilingual Education and Bilingualism |volume=21  |issue=6  |pages=1–19 |year=2016 |doi=10.1080/13670050.2016.1203858}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* bi- or multilinguals are exceptions to the ‘default’ monolingual ‘norm’;
* in order to deserve the label ‘bi-/multilingual’, one needs to have an equal, ‘perfect’, ‘nativelike’ command of both/all her/his languages;
* childhood bilingualism may be detrimental to both linguistic and cognitive development and consequently lead to poorer results at school;
* exposing a child to more than one tongue may cause language impairment or deficits, or that for children already diagnosed with impairments two languages mean too much unnecessary pressure and effort;
*children do not have enough time to learn both languages, therefore it is better if they only acquire the majority language.

These are all harmful convictions which have long been debunked,&lt;ref name="ParadowskiBator2016"/&gt; yet still persist among many parents. It is important to understand what constitutes the decision for sending children to a bilingual school. The decision should be based on, appropriate age, curriculum, and the preference of the child.&lt;ref name="biling"&gt;{{cite web|last=Racoma|first=Bernadine|title=The Pros and Cons of Sending Your Kids to a Bilingual School|url=https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/2014/03/the-pros-and-cons-of-sending-your-kids-to-a-bilingual-school-3924|website=Day Translations|date=2014-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=June 2017|certain=y}}

In spite of these myths surrounding language education, there are numerous significant benefits to a child's development when exposed to secondary language education. The American Council on the Teaching of Foreign Languages has identified over twenty benefits to a child's development when provided adequate secondary language education, therefore debunking the vast majority of myths that may inhibit such education &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crane |first1=John |title=When Will Public Elementary Schools in the US Finally Start Teaching Foreign Languages? |url=https://medium.com/@jcrane1/when-will-public-elementary-schools-in-the-us-finally-start-teaching-foreign-languages-6cbc2716161b |website=Medium.com |accessdate=16 November 2018|date=2018-09-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==By country or region==

===Africa===
In the African region, Countries such as Mozambique have taken the lead in bilingual education. The Ministry of Education and Human Development has made primary education fully bilingual in 2017. Children will be taught 16 Mozambican dialects during their early years of schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201503190228.html|title=Mozambique: Fully Bilingual Primary Education as From 2017|date=2015-03-19|work=Agencia de Informacao de Mocambique (Maputo)|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many African states introduce mother languages as subjects and education tools along commonly spoken international or foreign languages. Mother language instruction is terminated immediately during the schooling cycle and leaves only the international language established. It becomes a disadvantage that contributes to substantial lack of motivation on the part of teachers, students, and parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.globalpartnership.org/blog/mother-language-education-africa|title=Mother language education in Africa|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{expand section|date=May 2016|1=e.g., [https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F978-0-387-30424-3_122], [http://www.edqual.org/publications/published-research/clegg07.pdf.1], [http://www.praesa.org.za/files/2012/07/Paper6.pdf], [https://www.teachingenglish.org.uk/sites/teacheng/files/C413%20Juba%20Publication_FINAL_WEB%20ONLY%20v3.pdf], [https://books.google.com/books?id=FMoWyso1vuQC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIIzAA], [https://books.google.com/books?id=D6iIlllyNCEC&amp;pg=PA171&amp;dq=bilingual+education+africa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwik4vGxwrfMAhWjIqYKHYA0B58Q6AEIRTAG], etc.}}

====Senegal====
Although bilingual schools exist, the majority of Senegalese schools teach in French and follow the French system. However, studies have shown that approximately 80% of teachers use a 'local language' in order to communicate with all of their students.&lt;ref name="World Data on Education, Senegal"&gt;United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization.

(in French)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia===
[[Asia]] is the [[Earth|Earth's]] largest and most populous [[continent]], located primarily in the [[Eastern Hemisphere|eastern]] and [[northern hemisphere]]s. It includes a large number of countries, some of which are grouped into subregions.

====China====
In the [[Autonomous regions of China]] many children of the country's major ethnic minorities attend public schools where the medium of instructions is the local language, such as e.g. [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] or [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]]. Traditionally, the textbooks there were little different from merely a translated version of the books used in the Chinese schools throughout the country; however, as of 2001, a move was on foot to create more teaching materials with locally based content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|

&lt;/ref&gt;

Classes of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]] as second language are also offered in these minority schools, and the central government makes increasing efforts to make them more effective. A law passed in February 2001 provided for the Mandarin-as-second-language classes in the ethnic-minority schools to start in the early years of elementary school whenever local conditions permit, rather than in the senior years of elementary school, as it was practiced before.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), pp. 119-120&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, it has been reported that Chinese has been used as the medium of instructions in some [[Autonomous county|autonomous counties]] even though less than 50% of the population "spoke and understood some Chinese"; this mismatch was thought to have contributed to the low grades earned by the students on the math and Chinese exams.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou (2004), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Hong Kong =====
In [[Hong Kong]] where both [[English language|English]] and [[Cantonese]] are official, both languages are taught in school and are mandatory subjects. Either English or Cantonese is used as the medium of instruction for other subjects. Increasingly, there are a large number of [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]]-speaking schools in operation throughout Hong Kong as well since 1996. Study of Mandarin is mandatory in junior years (from Grade 1 to Grade 9). Hong Kong also has a bilingual education program using both Cantonese and Hong Kong Sign Language.

=====Macao=====
Chinese and Portuguese are the official languages of [[Macau]], but English plays an unofficial and highly prominent role. English is the language of instruction at the University of Macau and at some secondary schools. Other schools use Cantonese as the language of instruction. {{as of|2013}} there was one Portuguese-medium school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.languageonthemove.com/multilingual-macau/|title=Multilingual Macau|date=April 22, 2013|publisher=languageonthemove.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Japan====
{{More citations needed|date=March 2007}}
In Japan, the need for bilingualism (mostly Japanese and English) has been pointed out, and there are some scholars who advocate teaching children subjects such as mathematics using English rather than Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://japansociology.com/2013/06/08/bilingual-education-in-japan/|title=Bilingual Education in Japan|date=2013-06-08|work=JAPANsociology|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this proposal, subjects such as history, however, would be taught solely in Japanese.

On the island of [[Hokkaido]], the indigenous and endangered [[Ainu language]] is receiving newfound interest with establishment of a small number of bilingual Ainu-Japanese elementary schools.

The largest non-Japanese, non-native to Japan minority are the [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans]]. Bilingual education in [[Korean language]] is provided by Korean international schools, more of which are affiliated with [[Chongryon]].

====Middle East====

=====The Arab World=====
Schools in the [[Middle East]] follow dual or triple language programmes.  The triple language programme is most commonly found in [[Lebanon]], [[Tunisia]], [[Syria]], and often implemented as well in [[Egypt]].  History, grammar, literature and the [[Arabic language]] are taught in the native language (Arabic), whereas Mathematics and sciences are generally taught in English and/or French.  In Lebanon, however, science and mathematics are taught in either French or English, depending on the school's administration or the grade level.  It is not uncommon to find French- or English- only schools, though usually these institutions are primarily international establishments.

In most [[Gulf countries]] as well as [[Jordan]], English is introduced as a second language early on alongside the primary medium of instruction, Arabic.  In [[Iraq]] however, triple language programmes are, like in Lebanon and Syria, normal, except rather than using French, [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is taught alongside Arabic and English due to Iraq's considerably sized Kurdish minority in the north, and bilingual official language policy regarding Kurdish.

In [[Morocco]], [[Berber languages|Berber]] can be used as a regional medium of elementary education, with widespread use of French and Arabic in higher grades. Due to Morocco's history of French colonialism, sole French-medium education is very widespread.

=====Israel=====
Normally, Israelis are taught in either Hebrew or Arabic depending on religion and ethnicity. Within the standard education system, thorough study of English is compulsory, and depending on the primary medium of education, Arabic or Hebrew are introduced as third languages with significantly lesser emphasis placed on achieving solid proficiency.  Within Hebrew-medium programmes, other foreign languages such as French, German, Russian, or Yiddish can often be studied as well.

Israel is also home to several international schools whereby the sole medium of education is either [[English language|English]] or [[French language|French]]. In general, as English is taught early on across all Israeli schools, most Israelis become comfortably bilingual, much like what one would see in The Netherlands or Scandinavian countries. This in combination with a large proportion of English-language programming on television that is merely subtitled and seldom dubbed.

Recent peace initiatives have also led to a small number of bilingual and multi-religious schools in which both Hebrew and Arabic are used in equal emphasis.  The [[Hand in Hand: Center for Jewish Arab Education in Israel]] runs four bilingual schools, and the [[Neve Shalom]] peace village also hosts a local school.

====Mongolia====
There has been long standing encouragement to teach at least one other language other than Mongolian. Traditionally [[Russian language]] was taught during middle school and high school. After the 1990 transition to democracy, English language has been gaining more ground in Mongolian schools. Today many public schools at all levels teach one other language that are usually English, Russian, Korean, Japanese or Chinese. Although the core curriculum is in Mongolian, it is generally encouraged by the government and the public that the students should have some command of a secondary language when they graduate from high school. Also there are other private schools that teach their curricula in English.

====South Asia====
[[South Asia]] is the [[south]]ern [[region]] of the [[Asia]]n [[continent]], comprising the [[Himalayas|sub-Himalayan]] [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC) countries and, [[#Definition by South Asian Studies programs|for some authorities]], adjoining countries to the west and east.

=====Bangladesh=====
In Bangladesh, Bengali is the first language. However, it has a colonial past and English is widely used in administrations, schools, courts etc. Bangladeshi children start English as Second Language quite early in their age (mostly from age 5-6). In National Curriculum, English is given an importance and it is taught compulsorily until twelfth grade. There are Government approved curriculum as well as other international systems of Educations which maintains English as a 'medium of instruction'.

=====India=====
{{Main|Bilingualism in India}}
The official languages of the Union of [[India]] are [[Hindi]] and English, with 21 other regional languages holding co-official status, including: [[Assamese language|Assamese]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]], [[Bodo language|Bodo]], [[Dogri]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada]], [[Kashmiri language|Kashmiri]], [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]], [[Malayalam]], [[Meitei language|Manipuri]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Nepali language|Nepali]], [[Odia language|Odia]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Santali language|Santali]], [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]] and [[Urdu]].

Education in India follows the [[Three-language formula]], where children are to be taught English (or the medium of instruction in the school, grades 1-12), The Second Language (grades 1-10) is the Official language of the state (In most non-Hindi states) or Hindi (in the others), in a few states some schools offer a choice between the State Language and Hindi, and the third language (grades 5-8, often Hindi (in the non-Hindi states), the regional language of the state (if the student opted for Hindi as the second language,  a foreign language or Sanskrit). An exception is [[Tamil Nadu]] where only [[Tamil language|Tamil]] and English are taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

English-medium schools often find favour with parents, especially in urban areas, due to English's international prestige, India's Colonial heritage, its usage in Indian business and it being the medium of instruction in most Indian universities.

=====Philippines=====
In July 2009 [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] moved towards [[Education in the Philippines#Breakdown of the Program|mother-tongue based learning]] initially by issuing an order which allowed two alternative three-year bridging plans. Depending on the bridging plan adopted, the Filipino and English languages are to be phased in as the language of instruction beginning in the third and fourth grades.&lt;ref&gt;. [https://web.archive.org/web/20100821182443/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074%2C%20s.%202009.pdf DepEd Order 74 of 2009] (PDF, archived from [http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf the original] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120616225924/http://www.deped.gov.ph/cpanel/uploads/issuanceImg/DO%20No.%2074,%20s.%202009.pdf |date=2012-06-16 }} on 2010-08-21))&lt;/ref&gt; Other [[Philippine languages|Philippine regional languages]] are taught in schools, colleges and universities located in their [[Provinces of the Philippines|respective provinces]].

In 2007, President [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] signed a directive in Spain that would reintroduce teaching and learning the Spanish language in the Philippine school system starting in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://getrealphilippines.com/blog/2012/07/re-introduction-of-spanish-mandated-by-arroyo-in-2007-trumpeted-by-bs-aquino-today/|title=Re-introduction of Spanish mandated by Arroyo in 2007, trumpeted by BS Aquino today|date=July 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order, Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007, issued on November 29, 2007, ordered the Department of Education to encourage the teaching and learning of the Spanish language throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.ph/2007/11/29/memorandum-order-no-276-s-2007/|title= Memorandum Order No. 276, s. 2007|date=November 29, 2007|work=Official Gazette|publisher=Government of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Singapore=====
In Singapore, education is bilingual. The medium of instruction is in English and the learning of the mother tongue is compulsory. The mother tongue subject is usually [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Malay language|Malay]] or [[Tamil language|Tamil]], the other official languages of Singapore. They are taught till pre-university level. Previously, students either attended an English-medium or a "vernacular school", which taught in one of the mother tongues. In 1960, government legislation standardised the primary medium of instruction to English, with the different vernacular languages ("mother tongue") allocated as the second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Development of Education in Singapore since 1965|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1121703274255/1439264-1153425508901/Development_Edu_Singapore_draft.pdf |accessdate=29 November 2012 |work= Associate Professor Goh Chor Boon and Professor S. Gopinathan|publisher=National Institute of Education | date=June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Students may also choose to learn a third language (German, French, Japanese, etc.) in secondary school and junior college or, if their respective school does not offer the language, at a [[Ministry of Education (Singapore)|MOE]] Language Centre. This option is limited however, to the top 10% of any PSLE cohort; prospective third language students must have also scored A grades for English and their second language. Singaporean students returning from abroad who did not learn a second language may be exempted from their mother tongue and learn another second language in place of the mother tongue; however, such exemptions are rare and only granted on a case-to-case basis.

=====Thailand and Malaysia=====
Since the mid-1990s bilingual approaches to schooling and higher education have become popular in parts of [[South-east Asia]], especially in [[Thailand]] and [[Malaysia]] where different models have been applied, from L2 immersion (content taught in a non-native language) to parallel immersion, where core subjects are taught in both the mother-tongue and a second language (usually English).

English has been taught in schools in Malaysia as it is a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] country (former British colony). During the 1980s to 1990s, when schools were nationalised under the government of Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohamad]], English became a second language instead of the primary language of instruction. The Malaysian government reversed its decision to have Maths and Science taught in English, but is implementing different programmes designed to improve English language teaching within schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia drops English language teaching|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/jul/10/malaysia-tefl|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=10 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision has raised numerous debates, with various groups arguing for and against the use of English in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The sad state of English in Malaysia|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/malaysia/sad-state-english-malaysia|publisher=[[AsiaOne]]|work=[[The Straits Times]]|date=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the existence of vernacular schools and prominent usage of dialects, some Chinese and Indian children become trilingual, speaking Malay, English and their mother tongue or dialect. However, English is still widely spoken as a [[de facto]] language of trade and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Child Language Development in Singapore and Malaysia|chapter=The Malaysian Sociolinguistic Situation:An Overview|page=7|first1=Irene F.H.|last1=Wong|first2=Henry|last2=Thambyrajah|editor-first=Anna|editor-last=Kwan-Terry|date=1991|publisher=[[NUS Press|Singapore University Press]]|isbn=9789971691493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The difficulties and disputes characteristic of the US experience have not been replicated in these Asian countries, though they are not without controversy.  Generally, it can be said that there is widespread acknowledgment of the need to improve English competence in the population, and bilingual approaches, where language is taught through subject content, are seen to be the most effective means of attaining this.  The most significant limiting factors are the shortage of teachers linguistically competent to teach in a second language and the costs involved in use of expatriate native speakers for this purpose.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], some schools teach bilingual programs which cater to children speaking languages other than English. Baldauf&lt;ref&gt;(2005)&lt;/ref&gt; explains that these programs are now beginning to benefit from more government support. Bilingual education for Indigenous students, however, has only received intermittent official backing. In the Northern Territory, for example, bilingual programs for Indigenous students begun with Federal Government support in the early 1970s, but by December 1998 the Northern Territory Government had announced its decision to shift $3 million away from the 29 bilingual programs to a Territory-wide program teaching English as a second language. Within 12 months though the government had softened its position. Most bilingual programs were allowed to continue under the guise of two-way education. Then on 24 August 2005, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training announced that the government would be "revitalizing bi-lingual education" at 15 Community Education Centres: [[Alekerange, Northern Territory|Alekerange]], [[Angurugu, Northern Territory|Angurugu]], [[Borroloola, Northern Territory|Borroloola]], [[Gapuwiyak, Northern Territory|Gapuwiyak]], [[Gunbalanya, Northern Territory|Gunbalanya]], [[Kalkaringi, Northern Territory|Kalkaringi]], [[Lajamanu, Northern Territory|Lajamanu]], [[Maningrida, Northern Territory|Maningrida]], [[Milingimbi Island|Milingimbi]], [[Ramingining, Northern Territory|Ramingining]], [[Ngkurr, Northern Territory|Ngkurr]], Shepherdson College, [[Numbulwar, Northern Territory|Numbulwar]], [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] and [[Yuendumu, Northern Territory|Yuendumu]]. This revitalisation is conceived as part of an effort aimed at "providing effective education from pre-school through to senior secondary at each of the Territory's 15 Community Education Centres". As Harris &amp; Devlin (1986) observe, "Aboriginal bilingual education in Australia represents much more than a range of education programs. It has been a measure of non-Aboriginal commitment to either assimilation or cultural pluralism". In 2008 it again shifted with the government attempting to force the nine remaining bilingual schools to teach the first four hours of classes in English.

===Europe===
The ''[[European Schools]]'' group is a network of thirteen private schools in EU countries that provide multilingual and multicultural education at nursery, primary and secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Locations of the European Schools |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/locations |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Organisation of studies |url=https://www.eursc.eu/en/European-Schools/studies/studies-organisation |website=Office of the Secretary-General of the European Schools |accessdate=12 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belgium====
[[Belgium]] has three official languages: [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]] and [[German language|German]]. The constitution guarantees free education, so private schools can use any language, but state(-recognised) schools teach in the language of the language area where it is located. For [[Brussels]], which is an officially bilingual French-Dutch area, schools use either Dutch or French as medium.

Even though Belgium has two major languages (Dutch in Flanders, and French in Wallonia), bilingual instruction does rarely occur since Belgian law only permits education in one official language. In Flanders, bilingual instruction is only allowed as a short-term project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=Exploring bilingualism in a monolingual school system: insights from Turkish and native students from Belgian schools|journal=British Journal of Sociology of Education|date=1 May 2010|volume=31|issue=3|pages=307–321|doi=10.1080/01425691003700540|url=https://ugent.academia.edu/OrhanAgirdag/Papers/202294/Exploring_Bilingualism_In_a_Monolingual_School_System_Insights_From_Turkish_and_Native_Students_From_Belgian_Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
{{See also|Language policy in France}}
[[France]] has one official language, [[French language|French]]. However, regional provincial languages including [[Corsican language|Corsican]], [[Breton language|Breton]], [[Gallo language|Gallo]], [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Franco-Provençal language|Franco-Provençal]], [[Occitan language|Occitan]], and [[Catalan language|Catalan]] have charter protection, and bilingual education programmes and regional language course electives have been established. However, due to the strict French-language policy imposed by national government, there is no centrally allocated funding for any of these programmes. All funding is at the municipal level, with many of the regional languages face extreme endangerment. France is known for wanting to maintain its lingual and cultural roots, and speaking a language other than French or mixing French with other languages is looked down on. This is apparent the French educational system, where French is highly prioritized over other languages and emphasis is put not only on the maintenance of the French language, but also on pushing students not to integrate French with other languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Costa|first=James|date=6 Mar 2010|title=France and Language (s): Old Policies and New Challenges in Education.

====Netherlands====
In the [[Netherlands]], there are around 100 bilingual schools. In these schools, the first language is Dutch, whereas the second language is usually English and occasionally German. In the province of [[Friesland]], where [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]] is an official language, some primary schools are trilingual, teaching in Dutch, West Frisian, and English. Most bilingual secondary schools are TVWO (Bilingual Preparatory Scientific Education), but THAVO (Bilingual Higher General Secondary Education) and TVMBO-TL (Bilingual Preparatory Vocational Education - Theoretical Learning Pathway)&lt;ref&gt;TVMBO-TL was recently introduced at O.R.S. Lek en Linge, Culemborg https://www.lekenlinge.nl/downloaddocument?pid=163&amp;doc=KDEyKS10d2VldGFsaWctdm1iby10LnBkZg==&lt;/ref&gt; have been introduced, too.

====Republic of Ireland====
The Republic of Ireland has two official languages, [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[English language|English]]. With the [[Irish language]] facing endangerment, as well as the presence of regions where Irish is still spoken as native (referred to as the [[Gaeltacht]]), the [[Irish constitution]] protects and reserves the right for education to be established through the medium of either official language, and it thus is.

An Irish-medium school is referred to as [[Gaelscoil]] (plural, Gaelscoileanna) This movement has been met with some success in that 10% of the schooling in Ireland is conducted in Irish. The movement has also been successful in setting up schools in both urban and rural areas, ranging from Dublin and Cork, to the traditional Gaeltacht regions.

====Spain====

=====Andalusia=====
In [[Andalusia]] (Spain's second southernmost region), things have changed drastically concerning bilingual education since the introduction of the Plurilingualism Promotion Plan by the autonomous government. The plan was born as the realization for the Andalusian territory of the European language policies regarding the teaching and learning of languages. With special strength in the past ten years bilingual education has worked at most elementary schools.

In addition to this new European scene, the Scheme for the Promotion of Plurilingualism has learned a lot from the first experimental bilingual sections set up in some schools by the Andalusian government in 1998. Following the content-based approach, French and German were used to partly teach other subjects. This successful experience, as show the international tests that the students have been given, is the starting point for a more ambitious scene, where 400 schools will be involved in the next four years, more languages, especially English, will take part, and a lot of investigation and implementation of the Integrated Curriculum of languages must be carried out.

Being aware of the necessity of the Andalusian people to adapt to the new scenario, a major government plan, called "strategies for the second modernization of Andalusia", was designed in 2003. The document also underlined language diversity as a source of richness and a valuable heritage of humankind which needs to be looked after.

It was then clear that a scheme was needed to carry out this new language policy in the territory, especially affecting education, with clear goals, timing and funding.

The scheme is to be developed through five major programmes and also an organization and assessment plan.

The programmes are:
*Bilingual schools
*Official Schools of Languages
*Plurilingualism and teachers
*Plurilingualism and society
*Organization and assessment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205105956/http://www.juntadeandalucia.es/averroes/plurilinguismo/planing.pdf|archive-date=2009-02-05|title=Plurilingualism Promotion Plan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Basque Country, Navarre, Galicia, Catalonia, Valencia and the Balearic Islands=====
In addition to [[Castilian Spanish]] being the primary [[official language]] of [[Spain]], the kingdom also has several co-official regional languages which enjoy equal and unbiased constitutional protection and promotion: [[Catalan language|Catalan/Valencian]] (in [[Catalonia]], [[Valencian Community|Valencia]] and the [[Balearic Islands]]), [[Galician language|Galician]] (in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]), [[Basque language|Basque]] (in the [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] and the northern zone of [[Navarre]]) and [[Aranese]] (in [[Val d'Aran]], [[Catalonia]]).

Many schools are bilingual in the regional language as well as Castilian at both the elementary and secondary levels. Regional universities also often provide programmes through the regional medium. Education in all co-official languages uses to receive both national and regional funding.

Unlike [[France]] in which regional languages face incredible endangerment and possible extinction, Spain's long-established approach to making regional bilingual education mandatory has served often as a model for both the survival and thriving state of the languages indigenous to the country.

====Sweden====
[[Sweden]] has one official language and five recognized minority languages,&lt;ref&gt;Hult, F.M. (2004). Planning for multilingualism and minority language rights in Sweden. ''Language Policy, 3''(2), 181-201.&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Swedish language|Swedish]] is to great extent the only one of these in which education is offered. During the 21st century more and more schools started to offer national programs in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agirdag|first=Orhan|title=The International School Consultancy Group|url=http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304000123/http://www.iscresearch.com/information/isc-news.aspx|archivedate=2016-03-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====United Kingdom and dependencies====
The British Isles have several indigenous languages apart from [[English language|English]]. These include [[Welsh language|Welsh]] (official in Wales), [[Irish Language|Irish]], [[Manx Gaelic]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]], [[Scottish Gaelic]], and the [[Scots language]] (which is sometimes considered as a dialect of English).

[[Scotland]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Wales]], [[Cornwall]], and the [[Isle of Man]] have each established bilingual programmes which provide education through the medium of their indigenous language. Most often, except for the cases of Manx and Cornish, these programmes exist where the language is spoken communally as a first language.

=====Wales=====
Roughly a quarter of schoolchildren in Wales now receive their education through the [[Welsh medium education|medium of Welsh]], and children wishing to join a Welsh medium school ({{Lang-cy|ysgol Gymraeg}}) do not have to speak Welsh to go to one if they are young enough to learn the language quickly. Welsh medium education has met with great success across Wales since the first such schools opened in the 1940s. There are current plans to extend further provision in urban centres such as [[Cardiff]], [[Newport, Wales|Newport]], [[Swansea]] and [[Llanelli]] to cater for growing demand; this has caused controversy in some areas.

Welsh-speaking areas use Welsh-medium education almost exclusively. Parents have a legal right for their children to receive education in Welsh, and each local authority caters for this. In the Western flank of Wales, [[Carmarthenshire]], [[Ceredigion]], [[Gwynedd]] and [[Anglesey]], most primary and secondary schools are Welsh medium or have bilingual streams. Some 75-80% of all pupils in [[Carmarthenshire]] and [[Ceredigion]] receive their education through the medium of Welsh, with this figure increasing in Gwynedd to around 90%.

In English-medium schools, the study of Welsh is compulsory and must be taught from age 5 to age 16 in all state-funded schools.

=====Northern Ireland=====
Irish Gaelic received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. A cross-border body known as [[Foras na Gaeilge]] was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic.
The British government in 2001 ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Irish Gaelic (in respect only of Northern Ireland) was specified under Part III of the Charter, thus giving it a degree of protection and status somewhat comparable to the Welsh language in Wales and Scottish Gaelic in Scotland. This included a range of specific undertakings in relation to education, translation of statutes, interaction with public authorities, the use of placenames, media access, support for cultural activities and other matters (whilst the Ulster variant of [[Scots language|Scots]], known as [[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]], was specified under Part II of the Charter.)

The Education (Northern Ireland) Order 1998 states: "It shall be the duty of the Department (of Education) to encourage and facilitate the development of Irish-medium education."

There are no Ulster Scots-medium schools, even at primary level.

=====Canada=====
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}

======English and French======
In [[Canada]], education is under provincial jurisdiction. However, the federal government has been a strong supporter of establishing Canada as a bilingual country and has helped pioneer the [[French immersion]] programs in the public education systems throughout Canada. In French-immersion, students with no previous French language training, usually beginning in Kindergarten or grade 1, do all of their school work in French. Depending on provincial jurisdiction, some provinces also offer an extended French program that begins in grade 5 which offers relatively more courses in French. In this case the student takes French immersion until grade nine but may continue throughout their high school education. Similar English-immersion programmes also exist for Francophone children.

Education is generally monolingual in either English or French according to the majority population within which a school is located.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} The second official language is introduced with allocated time provided each week for instruction in the language as a subject.

======Quebec======
Quebec is Canada's only legally monolingual French-speaking province. Based on section 59 of Canada's Constitution Act of 1982, provides that not all of the language rights listed under Canada's official bilingualism policy in previous section 23 will apply in Quebec. Specifically:

(1) In Quebec, a child may be educated in English only if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in English.

(2)In New Brunswick, Canada's only officially bilingual province, students have the right to education in the official language which they understand; students able to understand both languages have the right to education in either system.

(3) In the rest of Canada, a child may be educated in French if at least one parent or a sibling was educated in Canada in French, or if at least one parent has French as his or her mother tongue (defined in section 23 as "first language learned and still understood").

One practical consequence of this asymmetry is that all migrants who arrive in Quebec from foreign countries are required to place their children in French-language schools. This includes immigrants whose mother tongue is English and immigrants who received their schooling in English.

On the other hand, Section 23 provides a nearly universal right to English-language schooling for the children of Canadian-born anglophones living in Quebec.
Section 23 also provides, in theory, a nearly universal right to French-language schooling for the children of all francophones living outside Quebec, including immigrants from French-speaking countries who settle outside Quebec, and who are Canadian citizens.

Another element of asymmetry between Quebec and most anglophone provinces is that while Quebec provides public English-language primary and secondary education throughout the province, most other provinces provide French-language education only "where numbers warrant."

======First Nations reserves and Inuit settlements======
Canada also has bilingual programmes for [[First Nations]]' languages on numerous [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canadian aboriginal]] reserves in combination with either English, French, or both. Some programmes are gradually being established, whilst others are already long established. Most notable bilingual programmes that exist include [[Inuktitut]], [[Inuinnaqtun]], [[Cree]], [[Blackfoot]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Mohawk language|Mohawk]], [[Mi'kmaq language|Mi'kmaq]], and Pacific Coast [[Salish languages]].

Many of these programmes were set up in the late 1980s and early 1990s by academic [[linguists]] wishing to preserve the languages, respectively - especially in areas where there either is a healthy speaking base, or an endangerment of as low as two remaining speakers of a language. Prior to this, as late as the 1970s and early 1980s, First Nations and [[Inuit]] in Canada, as Native Americans in the United States, were forced into [[Canadian Indian residential school system|residential schools]] imposed on them by the Canadian government to integrate indigenous cultures into European-Canadian society. This came with the dramatic loss of the languages, religious beliefs, and cultures themselves due to widespread use of corporal punishment and mental abuse. As of 2010, new programmes are mushrooming across Canada to try to save what is left, but are often met with mixed success and funding challenges at federal, provincial, and reserve levels.

======Other minority languages======
In the province of [[British Columbia]], the city of [[Vancouver]] since 2002 has established a new bilingual Mandarin Chinese-English immersion programme at the elementary school level in order to accommodate Vancouver's both historic and present strong ties to the Chinese-speaking world, already in itself having a very sizeable Chinese population local to the city. Six Vancouver schools have thus far adopted the programme, and a secondary school track to continue thereupon is being designed. Other suburbs within what is referred to as the [[Greater Vancouver Regional District]] are also considering adopting the programme into a small number of schools. Similar programmes are being developed for both [[Hindi]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] to serve in representing the large South Asian cultural community and its interests in the [[City of Surrey]]. By default, most schools in British Columbia teach through English, with French immersion options available. In both English and French-medium schools, one can study and take government exams in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]] at the secondary level.

In [[Alberta]], the city of [[Edmonton]] has had a well established Chinese (Mandarin) bilingual education program ([[Edmonton Chinese Bilingual Education Association]]) since 1982. The program is currently offered in 13 schools throughout the city consisting of 6 elementary schools, 4 junior high schools and 3 high schools. Students enrolled in any of the elementary schools spend half a day learning in Chinese and the other half in English.

In [[Manitoba]], [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] communities have played an extensive role in the development and history of the province. Bilingual Ukrainian-English education programmes have therefore long been established, alongside smaller programmes introducing and implementing [[French language|French]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] in the town of [[Gimli, Manitoba|Gimli]], and [[First Nations]]' languages.

Private Islamic and Jewish schools across Canada also have bilingual and trilingual programmes that include [[Arabic]] or [[Hebrew]], respectively.

In [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and other parts of [[Nova Scotia]], a number of secondary schools now offer the option of taking introductory courses in [[Scottish Gaelic]], as reflecting upon the province's both intimate and dark history with the Gaelic language and Highland Scottish diaspora.

=====United States=====
[[File:SER-Niños Charter School.jpg|thumb|[[SER-Niños Charter School]], a bilingual [[charter school|state charter school]] in the [[Gulfton, Houston|Gulfton]] area of [[Houston]], [[Texas]]]]
Bilingual education in the U.S. focuses on English Language Learners (ELL).

The emphasis on English rejects that the student has a dominant language as part of their identity and culture that will continue to develop with time. According to the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] website, a bilingual education program is "an educational program for [[limited English proficiency|limited English proficient]] students". (The Office of English Language Acquisition, 2009).{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} The term "limited English proficiency" remains in use by the federal government, but has fallen out of favor elsewhere. According to [http://www.bankstreet.edu/literacyguide/ell.html Bankstreet's Literacy Guide] this shift is due to the fact that the term ELL represents a more accurate reflection of language acquisition. The term "English language learner" is now preferred in schools and educational research to refer to a student whose first language is not English and who needs language support services in order to succeed in school.

In the United States, proponents of the practice argue that it will not only help to keep non-English-speaking children from falling behind their peers in math, science, and social studies while they master English, but such programs teach English better than English-only programs. For many students, the process of learning literacy and a new language simultaneously is simply an overwhelming task, so bilingual programs began as a way to help such students develop native language literacy first - research by Cummins,&lt;ref&gt;(1997)&lt;/ref&gt; a central researcher in the field, shows that skills such as literacy developed in a first language will transfer to English. Opponents of bilingual education argue that it delays students' mastery of English, thereby retarding the learning of other subjects as well. In [[California]], where at least one-third of students were enrolled in bilingual classes in the mid-1990s,&lt;ref name="'70s 270"&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 978-0-465-04195-4|pages= 270–271|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; there has been considerable politicking for and against bilingual education.

The very first instance of bilingual education in the United States occurred with Polish immigrants in the first permanent English settlement of [[Virginia]] in what is now the United States. The Poles provided the community with manufactured pitch necessary to prevent the sinking of ships, and glass works among other industries. When the [[House of Burgesses]] met in 1619, the rights extended only to Englishmen. The Poles, in turn, launched the first recorded strike in the New World.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"&gt;{{cite book |title= In Quest of a Cultural Identity: An Inquiry for the Polish Community|last= Seidner|first= Stanley S.|year= 1976|publisher= IUME, Teachers College, [[Columbia University]]|location= New York, New York|id= ERIC ED167674|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED167674&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED167674 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In dire need of their skills and industries, the Poles received the "[[rights of Englishmen]]," and established the first bilingual schools with subjects taught in English and Polish.&lt;ref name="In Quest of a Cultural Identity"/&gt;  From this first documented historic beginning, bilingual education existed in some form or another in the United States. During the 18th century, Franciscan missionaries from California to Texas used indigenous languages for translating and teaching the Catholic catechism to Native Americans. By the mid-19th century, private and public bilingual schools had include such native languages as Czech, Dutch, French, German, Norwegian, Spanish, and Swedish.&lt;ref name="The American bilingual Tradition"&gt;{{cite book |title= The American bilingual Tradition|last= Kloss|first= Heinz|origyear= 1977|year= 1998|publisher= Newbury House|location= Rowley, MA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio became the first state in 1839, to adopt a bilingual education law, authorizing German-English instruction at parents' request. Louisiana enacted an identical provision for French and English in 1847, and the New Mexico Territory did so for Spanish and English in 1850.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book |title= Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice|last= Crawford|first= James|year= 1999|publisher= BES|location= Los Angeles, CA|isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the 19th century, about a dozen states had passed similar laws. Elsewhere, many localities provided bilingual instruction without state sanction, in languages as diverse as Norwegian, Italian, Polish, Czech, and Cherokee.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt; Beginning in 1959, public schools in Miami introduced bilingual programs. In 1968 the U.S., with Title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, or, informally, the [[Bilingual Education Act]], Congress first mandated bilingual education in order to give immigrants access to education in their "first" language. The Act was amended in 1988.&lt;ref name="Bilingual Education: History, Politics, Theory and Practice"/&gt;  Federal spending on bilingual education jumped from $7.5 million in 1968 to $150 million by 1979.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

A 1974 [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruling, ''[[Lau v. Nichols]]'', gave further momentum to bilingual education.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;  Here, the Court held that [[San Francisco]] schools violated minority language students' rights when they educated students in the same classes as other students&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; without special provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rethinkingschools.org/archive/17_02/Bili172.shtml Bilingual Education Is A Human and Civil Right - Volume 17 No. 2 - Winter 2002/2003 - Rethinking Schools Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken together, the [[Bilingual Education Act]] and the ''Lau v. Nichols'' ruling mandated that schools needed to at least provide some type of services to support English language learners, though neither specified what type of educational program needed to be provided.  As such, both bilingual and English-only programs flourished after the law's passage and the court ruling.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

The [[Bilingual Education Act]] was terminated in 2001 by new federal education policy, with the passage of [[No Child Left Behind]] by the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]]. This law offers no support for native language learning, but rather emphasized accountability in English only, and mandates that all students, including ELLs, are tested yearly in English.

The majority of U.S. high school students in the United States are required to take at least one to two years of a second language.  The vast majority of these classes are either French or Spanish.  In a large number of schools this is taught in a manner known as [[Language immersion|FLES]], in which students learn about the second language in a manner similar to other subjects such as mathematics or science.  Some schools use an additional method known as [[FLEX (Language Teaching)|FLEX]] in which the "nature of the language" and culture are also taught. High school education almost never uses "immersion" techniques.

======Controversy in the United States======
In recent times there has been a lot of discussion about bilingual education. In the 2009 U.S. Supreme Court decision, [[Horne v. Flores]], the majority opinion stated, "Research on ELL instruction indicates there is documented, academic support for the view that SEI ([[Structured English Immersion]]) is significantly more effective than bilingual education."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Proponents of bilingual education claim that it is not only easier for students to learn English if they are literate in their first language, but that such students will learn English better and become bilingual and biliterate.&lt;ref&gt;(see Krashen, 2002; August &amp; Hakuta, 1997; Crawford, 2000; Cummins, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; One study shows that English language learners introduced to a transitional bilingual program gained a fair amount of English comprehension and reading skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tong |first=F. |author2=Lara-Alecio, R. |author3=Irby, B. |author4=Mathes, P. |author5=Kwok, O. |date=2008 |title=Accelerating Early Academic Oral English Development in Transitional Bilingual and Structured English Immersion Programs |journal=American Educational Research Journal |volume=45 |issue=4 |pages=1011–1044 |doi=10.3102/0002831208320790 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents further claim that effective bilingual programs strive to achieve proficiency in both English and the students' home language. Dual language or Two-Way bilingual programs are one such approach, whereby half of the students speak English and half are considered English language learners (ELLs). The teacher instructs in English and in the ELLs' home language. The dual purpose of this type of classroom is to teach the children a new language and culture, and language diversity in such classrooms is seen as a resource. Programs in English only eradicate the native languages immigrants bring to this country, while dual language bilingual programs serve to maintain such languages in an "additive" context, where a new language is added without the first being lost. One paper states that two-way developmental bilingual education programs in elementary school have the most success in language minority students' long term academic achievement. These students will maintain their gains in academic performance in secondary level academic classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Collier |first=Virginia P. |date=Fall 1995 |title=Acquiring a Second Language for School |journal=Directions in Language &amp; Education - National Clearinghouse for Bilingual Education |volume=1 |issue=4 |quote=To assure cognitive and academic success in a second language, a student's first language system, oral and written, must be developed to a high cognitive level at least through the elementary-school years.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another study shows the positive results of a two-way bilingual education program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=National Center for Research on Cultural Diversity and Second Language Learning |date=March 1999 |title=Two-Way Bilingual Education Programs in Practice: A National and Local Perspective |journal=Center for Applied Linguistics |url=http://www.cal.org/resources/Digest/ed379915.html |accessdate=2008-03-14 |quote=Two-way programs provide both sets of students with ample exposure to the two languages, allowing them to progress academically in both languages and gain an appreciation of another culture. |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314215044/http://www.cal.org/resources/digest/ed379915.html |archivedate=14 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study suggests that the transitional bilingual education method can improve development of the native language without hindering the development of the English language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duran |first=L.K. |author2=Roseth, C.J. |author3=Hoffman, P. |date=2010 |title=An experimental study comparing English-only and Transitional Bilingual Education on Spanish-speaking preschoolers' early literacy development |journal=Early Chilhood Research Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=207–217 |doi=10.1016/j.ecresq.2009.10.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some mistakenly believe that once a student can converse in English (Basic interpersonal communication skills - BICS), they will naturally perform well academically (cognitive academic language proficiency - CALP) in English. It has been postulated that BICS and CALP are two different sets of skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book   |last =Carrasquillo  | first =Angela L  |author2=Rodriguez, Vivian  | title =Language Minority Students in the Mainstream Classroom | publisher =Multilingual Matters Ltd. | year =1996  | location =Bristol, PA  | page =202 |url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED392281&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED392281  | isbn =978-1-85359-297-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of bilingual education claim that students with other primary languages besides Spanish are placed in Spanish classes rather than taught in their native languages&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; and that many bilingual education programs fail to teach students English.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; Critics of bilingual education have claimed that studies supporting bilingual education tend to have poor methodologies and that there is little empirical support in favor of it.

The controversy over bilingual education is often enmeshed in a larger political and cultural context. Opponents of bilingual education are sometimes accused of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]]. This is especially so in the case of such groups as [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]], which is a conservative organization that promotes the stance that English should be the official language of the United States. In [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] and other cities, Minister of education of the [[Young Lords]], Tony Baez and others held marches and other activities to promote bilingual education. Proponents of bilingual education are frequently accused of practicing [[identity politics]], to the detriment of children and of immigrants.
:"To aid and monitor the education of English language learners (ELL)through mother-tongue and English education, the federal government enacted the Bilingual Education Act (Title V11) of the elementary and secondary Education Act in 1968. As an offshoot of president Lyndon B. Johnson's war on poverty, the act strove to help disenfranchised language-miniority students, especially Hispanics. Unfortunately, the acts aims were somewhat ambiguous. As Crawford (2000a) writes 'enacted at the apex of the Great Society, bilingual education act of 1968 passed congress without a single dissent. Americans have spent the past 30 years debating what it was meant to accomplish'." (p.&amp;nbsp;107).&lt;ref&gt;Ovando, Carlos J. (2003). "Bilingual Education in the United States: Historical Development and Current Issues" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/detail?accno=EJ666800 (Bilingual Research Journal, 27(1), 1-24.)]&lt;/ref&gt;

======California======
[[California]] is the state with the highest number of English Learners (ELs) in the United States. One out of three students in California is an EL.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt; In June 1998, [[Proposition 227]] was passed by 61% of the California electorate. This proposition mandates that ELs be placed in structured English immersion for a period "not normally to exceed one year," then be transferred to mainstream classrooms taught "overwhelmingly in English."&lt;ref&gt;[http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm State of California] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618094226/http://primary98.sos.ca.gov/VoterGuide/Propositions/227text.htm |date=2010-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposition also gave parents the possibility to request alternative programs for their children, however, the availability of waivers and information to parents have been a challenge in the implementation of this proposition.&lt;ref&gt;Parrish et al., (2002). "Proposition 227 and Instruction of English Learners in California: Evaluation Update" [http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED482963&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=eric_accno&amp;accno=ED482963 (U.S. Department of Education)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the California Department of Education contracted with the American Institutes for Research (AIR) and WestEd to conduct a five-year evaluation of the effects of Proposition 227.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |title=American Institutes for Research (AIR) |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070913185100/http://www.air.org/news/documents/227Report.pdf |archive-date=2007-09-13 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study methodology focused on "A combination of student achievement analysis, phone interviews, case study site visits, and written surveys was used to examine such questions as how the proposition was implemented, which EL services are most and least effective, and what [[unintended consequence]]s resulted from Proposition 227's implementation."

The authors caution about the limitations in the statewide data. California does not have the capacity to link student academic progress over time across years; however, using student-level linked data over time from the Los Angeles Unified School District, and complementing that analysis with surveys, site visits and interviews, the study found "no conclusive evidence favoring one instructional program over another." Students who remained in bilingual education have similar academic growth trajectories when compared with students who switched to English Immersion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |title=WestEd: Effects of the Implementation of Proposition 227 on the Education of English Learners, K-12: 2002 Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=2007-07-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711042851/http://www.wested.org/cs/we/view/rs/661 |archive-date=2007-07-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

California, among other states, also has many public schools which have Immersion programs, most commonly Spanish/English Immersion but also including other languages. Immersion programs include native speakers of both languages and include instruction in both languages, with primary (grade) schools typically having 90% instruction in the minority language in the early grades, transitioning to 50% instruction in each of the minority language and English in the upper grades.

Proposition 227 has been repealed in 2016 by [[California Proposition 58 (2016)]].

======Arizona======
California was followed by [[Arizona]] in the passage of similar legislation, [[English for Children (Arizona Proposition 203, 2000)|Arizona Proposition 203]], which ended several programs previously available to ESL students. Arizona was the first state to provide bilingual education in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="'70s 270"/&gt;

======Georgia======
During the 1990s the state of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] increased its foreign born population by 233%. That was the second largest increase in the country, and Georgia is the sixth fastest growing state in the United States. Georgia has the seventh largest illegal immigrant population in the country; in the 2000 census 228,000 illegal immigrants lived in the state. During the 1980s and 1990s a labor shortage in the carpet industry contributed to an increase in the Hispanic population of Whitfield County, Georgia. Today almost half of the students in the Dalton (the hub of Whitfield County) public schools are Hispanic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2416 New Georgia Encyclopedia: Whitfield County]&lt;/ref&gt;

Erwin Mitchell, a local Dalton lawyer, founded the [[Georgia Project]] in 1996 to help teach the influx of Hispanic students who have moved into the Dalton public schools. The Georgia Project partners with the [[University of Monterrey]] in Monterrey, [[Mexico]] to bring teachers from Mexico to Georgia Schools. Sixty teachers from the University of Monterrey have taught in Georgia since 1997, and they typically teach for two to three years on [[H-1B visa]]s. The Georgia Project also has a Summer Institute that trains American teachers to speak Spanish and learn about Mexican culture. The Georgia Project is a bilingual/bicultural program that is primarily funded from federal education appropriations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://communityresourcebank.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabid=874 National Immigration Forum: Community Resource Bank, Success Stories, The Georgia Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

======Native American Reservations======
Following similar [[First Nations]]' models to [[Canada]], academic [[linguists]] throughout the [[United States]] are working closely with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] reservations communities to establish immersion and second-language programs for a number of respective tribal languages including [[Navajo language|Navajo]], [[Hopi]], [[Cherokee]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Lakhota]], and [[Sioux]], among others. Due to the combination of often a violent and isolative relationship between European settlers and Native Americans, their languages and communities have suffered dramatically in terms of facing extreme endangerment or extinction. The success of these programmes is mixed, depending largely on how healthy the status of the language in question is.

However, English-medium education still remains most widely used. Native programs often suffer a lack of state support in terms of funding or encouragement due in large part to the strong preference towards a melting-pot society. [[Native American boarding schools]], which enforced white American values and the English language were extensively used as late as the 1990s, and were notorious for implementing corporal punishment if a Native child was caught speaking his or her language or freely practicing their tribal faith.

====South America====

=====Argentina=====
There are many English-Spanish schools in Argentina. Several of them are in the provinces where the Irish who were part of the local Elite used to live. While medium to big sized cities are likely to have several bilingual schools, bilingual education remains an exception rather than the norm and is generally reserved for the upper classes. There is not a nationally encompassing bilingual program available for public schools. Because of the ties that have historically bound private education to religious institutions, many of the bilingual schools in the country are Roman Catholic schools. For example, out of the three available bilingual schools in a medium-sized city such as Mar del Plata, two of them (Holy Mary of Northern Hills and Holy Trinity College) are practicing Roman Catholic schools. {{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Continuing to foster the abilities of children's mother tongue along with other languages has proven essential for their personal and educational development because they retain their cultural identity and gain a deeper understanding of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cummins|first=Jim|date=2001|title=Bilingual children's mother tongue: Why is it important for education|url=|journal=Sprogforum|volume=19|pages=15–20|via=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two 2016 studies of mother-tongue instruction in Ethiopia and Kenya respectively show that it had positive outcomes for the students in both countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Seid|first=Yared|date=2016-12-01|title=Does learning in mother tongue matter?

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

==Literary allusions==
[[File:Inspecting New Arrivals by Giulio Rosati 2.jpg|thumb|''Inspection of New Arrivals'', a typical [[orientalism|Orientalist]] fantasy painted by [[Giulio Rosati]] (1858–1917).]]

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

==Circassian features==
[[File:Circassian woman.jpg|thumb|Circassian woman, date unknown]]
[[File:Bella Kukan.jpg|thumb|Bella Kukan, "Miss Circassia," 2013]]
An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989. [http://johncolarusso.net/pdf/Prometheus_among_the_Circassians.pdf  "Prometheus among the Circassians"]. In ''The World &amp; I''. Washington, D.C.: The Washington Times Publishing Corporation. Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been suggested that a lithe and erect physique were favored for Circassians, and many villages had large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Colarusso |first=John |date=March 1989 |title=Prometheus among the Circassians: A modern oral tale from a little known people of the Caucasus shows striking parallels with myths from Ancient Greece, Ancient India and the pagan Germanic world |magazine=[[World and I]] |publisher=[[The Washington Times|Washington Times Publishing Corporation]] |volume= |issue= |pages=644–651 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maturin Murray Ballou]] described Circassians as being of the "fair and rosy-cheeked race," and "with a form of ravishing loveliness, large and lustrous eyes, and every belonging that might go to make up a Venus".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ballou |first=Maturin Murray |author-link=Maturin Murray Ballou |date=1851 |title=The Circassian Slave, or, the Sultan's Favorite: A Story of Constantinople and the Caucasus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fOhEAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=circassian%20ebony&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=fair%20and%20rosy-cheeked%20Circassian%20race&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Frederick Gleason]] |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Henry Lindlahr]]'s words in the early 20th century, "Blue-eyed Caucasian regiments today form the cream of the Sultan's army. Circassian beauties are admired for their abundant and luxuriant yellow hair and blue eyes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lindlahr |first=Henry |author-link=Henry Lindlahr |date=1974 |orig-year=1919 |chapter=Iris color and Mental Characteristics |title=Natural Therapeutics: Iridiagnosis and Other Diagnostic Methods |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7ky6m_hnfaIC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;vq=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;dq=Blue-eyed%20Caucasian%20regiments%20today%20form%20the%20cream%20of%20the%20Sultan's%20army.&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q=Circassian%20beauties%20are%20admired%20for%20their%20abundant%20and%20luxuriant%20yellow%20hair%20and%20blue%20eyes.&amp;f=false |location=Pomeroy, WA |publisher=Health Research Books |page=32 |isbn=978-0-787-30563-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Circassians; but going to the eastward in the same latitude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun-dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour; it ceases to be perfectly fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Tilloch |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-link=Alexander Tilloch |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-link=Richard Taylor (editor) |date=1816 |title=XLIV.

The pustules of the child in whom the artificial small-pox has been thus inoculated are employed to communicate the same distemper to others|sign=Voltaire|source=On Inoculation}}

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36362">'''Cognitive biology''' is an emerging science that regards natural [[cognition]] as a [[biological function]].&lt;ref&gt;p133 in Lyon and Keijzer (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on the theoretical assumption that every [[organism]]—whether a single cell or [[multicellular]]—is continually engaged in systematic acts of cognition coupled with intentional behaviors, i.e., a [[sensory-motor coupling]].&lt;ref&gt;Van Duijn, et al. (2006). "Principles of minimal cognition: Casting cognition as sensorimotor coordination."&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, if an organism can sense stimuli in its environment and respond accordingly, it is cognitive. Any explanation of how natural cognition may manifest in an organism is constrained by the biological conditions in which its genes survives from one generation to the next.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007). “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; And since by [[Darwinian theory]] the [[species]] of every organism is evolving from a common root, three further elements of cognitive biology are required: (i) the study of cognition in one species of organism is useful, through contrast and comparison, to the study of another species’ cognitive abilities;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Spetch and Friedman (2006), "Comparative cognition of object recognition.".&lt;/ref&gt; (ii) it is useful to proceed from organisms with simpler to those with more complex cognitive systems,&lt;ref&gt;Baluška and Mancuso (2009). Deep evolutionary origins of neurobiology: Turning the essence of ‘neural’ upside-down.&lt;/ref&gt; and (iii) the greater the number and variety of species studied in this regard, the more we understand the nature of cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013a) and visit the Comparative Cognition Society to enjoy their publication, ''[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
While [[cognitive science]] endeavors to explain human thought and the [[conscious mind]], the work of cognitive biology is focused on the most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the past several decades, biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large&lt;ref&gt;[1]See for examples Byrne, et al. (2009), “Elephant cognition in primate perspective.”&lt;/ref&gt; and small,&lt;ref&gt;For instance, Ben Jacob, et al. (2006). "Seeking the foundations of cognition in bacteria.”&lt;/ref&gt; both plant&lt;ref&gt;As one example, see Calvo and Keijzer  (2009), "Cognition in plants."&lt;/ref&gt; and animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comparative-cognition-and-behavior-reviews.org/ ''Comparative Cognition and Behavior Reviews'']&lt;/ref&gt; “Mounting evidence suggests that even [[bacteria]] grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with [[Biological specificity|conspecifics]] and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon and Opie (2007), “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; Without thinking or [[Perception|perceiving]] as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a [[stimulus (physiology)|stimulus]], then finds an appropriate [[Stimulus (psychology)|response]] in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is due to the lack of a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a ''[[science]]'' of cognitive biology has yet to be established.&lt;ref&gt;There is no mention of cognitive biology, for example, in Frankish and Ramsey (2012), ''The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science''. Nor is cognitive biology mentioned in Margolis, et al.(2012), ''The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy of Cognitive Science''.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[prolegomena]]&lt;ref&gt;At the 2007 meeting of the International Society for the History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, a paper was presented with the apt title: “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.” See Lyon and Opie (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors&lt;ref&gt;See Brian Goodwin and Ladislav Kováč, discussed below.&lt;/ref&gt; have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.

Although the two terms are sometimes used synonymously,&lt;ref&gt;See p135, 136, and 150 in Huber and Wilkinson (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive biology should not be confused with the [[Santiago Theory of Cognition|biology of cognition]] in the sense that it is used by adherents to the Chilean School of Biology of Cognition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inteco.cl/biology/&lt;/ref&gt; Also known as the Santiago School, the biology of cognition is based on the work of Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana,&lt;ref&gt;Maturana (1970), “Biology of Cognition.”&lt;/ref&gt; who crafted the doctrine of [[autopoiesis]]. Their work began in 1970 while the first mention of cognitive biology by [[Brian Goodwin]] (discussed below) was in 1977 from a different perspective.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977), "Cognitive biology." A copy of this four page paper is difficult to find. However, an eight page paper—Goodwin (1978), “A cognitive view of biological process,”—is easy to procure and uses his own 1977 paper as a reference. A study of the other references in the ’78 paper suggests a unique perspective without mention of Maturana or Varela.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
'Cognitive biology' first appeared in the literature as a paper with that title by [[Brian Goodwin|Brian C. Goodwin]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin (1977) "Cognitive biology."&lt;/ref&gt; There and in several related publications&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin 1976a, 1976b, and 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; Goodwin explained the advantage of cognitive biology in the context of his work on morphogenesis. He subsequently moved on to other issues of structure, form, and complexity with little further mention of cognitive biology. Without an advocate, Goodwin’s concept of cognitive biology has yet to gain widespread acceptance. 
 
Aside from an essay regarding Goodwin’s conception by [[Margaret Boden]] in 1980, the next appearance of ‘cognitive biology’ as a phrase in the literature came in 1986 from a professor of biochemistry, [[Ladislav Kováč]]. His conception, based on natural principles grounded in bioenergetics and molecular biology, is briefly discussed below. Kováč’s continued advocacy has had a greater influence in his homeland, Slovakia, than elsewhere partly because several of his most important papers were written and published only in Slovakian.

By the 1990s, breakthroughs in molecular, cell, evolutionary, and developmental biology generated a cornucopia of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Yet aside from the theorists already mentioned, no one was addressing cognitive biology except for Kováč.
 
=== Kováč’s cognitive biology ===

Ladislav Kováč's “Introduction to cognitive biology” (Kováč, 1986a) lists ten ‘Principles of Cognitive Biology.’ A closely related thirty page paper was published the following year: “Overview: Bioenergetics between chemistry, genetics and physics.” (Kováč, 1987). Over the following decades, Kováč elaborated, updated, and expanded these themes in frequent publications, including  "Fundamental principles of cognitive biology" (Kováč, 2000), “Life, chemistry, and cognition” (Kováč, 2006a), "Information and Knowledge in Biology: Time for Reappraisal” (Kováč, 2007) and "Bioenergetics: A key to brain and mind" (Kováč, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Although many of his publications are difficult to find, this URL has them all: &lt;http://www.biocenter.sk/lkpublics.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic usage ==

=== University seminar ===
The concept of cognitive biology is exemplified by this seminar description:&lt;ref&gt;The seminar, titled "Cognitive Biology," was presented by Professor William Bechtel in the autumn of 2013 by the Department of Cognitive Science at the University of California, San Diego. The [http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/ seminar description] was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session featured the presentation of a paper titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]" The paper’s author and host of the seminar sessions was [[William Bechtel]], a philosopher of science who has written extensively on the philosophy and history of cognitive science. See for example Bechtel, W., Abrahamsen, A. and Graham, G. (1998), ‘The life of cognitive science’, in ed. W. Bechtel and G. Graham, A Companion to Cognitive Science (Malden, MA and Oxford: Blackwell Publishers Ltd.), pp. 1–104. A more recent example: Abrahamsen, A. and Bechtel, W. (2012). History and core themes. In K. Frankish and W. Ramsey, The Cambridge Handbook of Cognitive Science. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
{{Cquote|Cognitive science has focused primarily on human cognitive activities. These include perceiving, remembering and learning, evaluating and deciding, planning actions, etc. But humans are not the only organisms that engage in these activities. Indeed, virtually all organisms need to be able to procure information both about their own condition and their environment and regulate their activities in ways appropriate to this information. In some cases species have developed distinctive ways of performing cognitive tasks. But in many cases these mechanisms have been conserved and modified in other species. This course will focus on a variety of organisms not usually considered in cognitive science such as bacteria, planaria, leeches, fruit flies, bees, birds and various rodents, asking about the sorts of cognitive activities these organisms perform, the mechanisms they employ to perform them, and what lessons about cognition more generally we might acquire from studying them.&lt;ref&gt;In the preceding paragraph, neither mention nor definition of cognitive biology is made. Rather, context is established through the initial three sentences and an excellent description of cognitive biology is presented thereafter. The original seminar description was followed by the schedule for ten sessions and citations for the several papers to be discussed in each session. The papers cover cognitive aspects for a broad range of motile organisms, beginning with two regarding the cognitive abilities of bacteria. Over the course of ten sessions, the speakers include six biologists, two doctors of psychology, and two doctors of philosophy. The initial session features a talk by Professor Bechtel titled to evoke discussion, "[http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/f13/cs200/bacterialinformationprocessing.pdf Bacterial Information Processing: Is It Cognition?]"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== University workgroup ===
The [[University of Adelaide]] has established a "Cognitive Biology" workgroup using this operating concept:
{{Cquote|Cognition is, first and foremost, a natural biological [[phenomenon]] — regardless of how the engineering of artificial intelligence proceeds. As such, it makes sense to approach cognition like other biological phenomena. This means first assuming a meaningful degree of continuity among different types of organisms—an assumption borne out more and more by [[comparative biology]], especially [[genomics]]—studying simple model systems (e.g., [[microbes]], worms, flies) to understand the basics, then scaling up to more complex examples, such as mammals and [[primates]], including humans.&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
Members of the group study the biological literature on simple organisms (e.g., [[nematode]]) in regard to cognitive process and look for [[homology (biology)|homologues]] in more complex organisms (e.g., crow) already well studied. This comparative approach is expected to yield simple cognitive concepts common to all organisms. “It is hoped a theoretically well-grounded toolkit of basic cognitive concepts will facilitate the use and discussion of research carried out in different fields to increase understanding of two foundational issues: '''what cognition is''' and '''what cognition does''' in the biological context.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon, Pamela (2013a). “Foundations for a Cognitive Biology.” Published on the homepage of the Cognitive Biology Project at the University of Adelaide. http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/&lt;/ref&gt; (Bold letters from original text.)
 
The group’s choice of name, as they explain on a separate webpage, might have been ‘[[embodied cognition]]’&lt;ref&gt;This option perpetuates a bias established by the original interdisciplinary grouping that formed the [[cognitive sciences]] in the 1970s: [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[psychology]]. Clarification of cognition was slow in coming, even as computers and robots became more efficient. Some argued that a cognitive agent had to be embodied to interface with the world, thus excluding stationary computers. So a new member was added to the cognitive sciences, i.e., the science of [[embodied cognition]]. Both robot frogs and biological frogs were valid subjects for experiment.&lt;/ref&gt; or ‘biological cognitive science.’&lt;ref&gt;Such a name implies that this is just another cognitive science, one among equals.&lt;/ref&gt; But the group chose ‘cognitive biology’ for the sake of (i) emphasis and (ii) method. For the sake of emphasis, (i) “We want to keep the focus on biology because for too long cognition was considered a function that could be almost entirely divorced from its physical instantiation, to the extent that whatever could be said of cognition almost by definition had to be applicable to both organisms and machines.” (ii) The method is to “assume (if only for the sake of enquiry) that cognition is a biological function similar to other biological functions—such as respiration, nutrient circulation, waste elimination, and so on.”&lt;ref&gt;Lyon (2013b). “Why Cognitive Biology?” http://www.hss.adelaide.edu.au/philosophy/cogbio/why/.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The method supposes that the genesis of cognition is biological, i.e., the method is ''[[biogenic substance|biogenic]]''. The host of the group’s website has said elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;See also Lyon and Opie (2007) “Prolegomena for a cognitive biology.”&lt;/ref&gt; that cognitive biology requires a biogenic approach, having identified ten principles of biogenesis in an earlier work.&lt;ref&gt;More detail can be found in Lyon (2006), “The biogenic approach to cognition.”.&lt;/ref&gt; The first four biogenic principles are quoted here to illustrate the depth at which the foundations have been set at the [[Adelaide]] school of cognitive biology:

#“Complex cognitive capacities have evolved from simpler forms of cognition. There is a continuous line of meaningful descent.”
#“Cognition directly or indirectly modulates the physico-chemical-electrical processes that constitute an organism .”
#“Cognition enables the establishment of reciprocal causal relations with an environment, leading to exchanges of matter and energy that are essential to the organism’s continued persistence, well-being or replication.”
#“Cognition relates to the (more or less) continuous assessment of system needs relative to prevailing circumstances, the potential for interaction, and whether the current interaction is working or not.”&lt;ref&gt;See Lyon (2006), pps 15-20 for the principles quoted.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other universities ===

* As another example, the Department für Kognitionsbiologie&lt;ref&gt;This is the official website for the Department für Kognitionsbiologie: &lt;http://cogbio.univie.ac.at/home&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at the University of Vienna declares in its mission statement a strong commitment “to experimental evaluation of multiple, testable hypotheses” regarding cognition in terms of evolutionary and developmental history as well as adaptive function and mechanism, whether the mechanism is cognitive, neural, and/or hormonal. “The approach is strongly comparative: multiple species are studied, and compared within a rigorous [[phylogenetic]] framework, to understand the evolutionary history and adaptive function of cognitive mechanisms (‘cognitive phylogenetics’).”&lt;ref&gt;Department für Kognitionsbiologie COGBIO: Department of Cognitive Biology, Faculty of Life Sciences,  University of Vienna, Austria&lt;/ref&gt; Their website offers a sample of their work: “Social Cognition and the Evolution of Language: Constructing Cognitive Phylogenies.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://cogcom.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/proj_cognition_communication/neuron10170_apxutw.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A more restricted example can be found with the Cognitive Biology Group,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kobi.nat.uni-magdeburg.de/ ]&lt;/ref&gt; Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, Otto-von-Guericke University (OVGU) in Magdeburg, Germany. The group offers courses titled “Neurobiology of Consciousness” and “Cognitive Neurobiology.”&lt;ref&gt;Courses from the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) [[Magdeburg]], Germany.&lt;/ref&gt; Its website lists the papers generated from its lab work, focusing on the neural correlates of perceptual consequences and visual attention. The group’s current work is aimed at detailing a dynamic known as ‘[[multistable perception]].’ The [[phenomenon]], described in a sentence: “Certain visual displays are not perceived in a stable way but, from time to time and seemingly spontaneously, their appearance wavers and settles in a distinctly different form.”&lt;ref&gt;Research at the Cognitive Biology Group, Institute of Biology, Faculty of Science, OVGU (Otto-von-Guericke University) Magdeburg, Germany.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A final example of university commitment to cognitive biology can be found at [[Comenius University]] in Bratislava, Slovakia. There in the Faculty of Natural Sciences, the Bratislava Biocenter is presented as a consortium of research teams working in biomedical sciences. Their website lists the Center for Cognitive Biology in the Department of Biochemistry at the top of the page, followed by five lab groups, each at a separate  department of bioscience. The webpage for the Center for Cognitive Biology &lt;ref&gt;http://www.biocenter.sk/welcome1a.html&lt;/ref&gt; offers a link to "Foundations of Cognitive Biology," a page that simply contains a quotation from a paper authored by Ladislav Kováč, the site’s founder. His perspective is briefly discussed below.

== Cognitive biology as a category ==

The words ‘cognitive’ and ‘biology’ are also used together as the name of a category. The category of ''cognitive biology'' has no fixed content but, rather, the content varies with the user. If the content can only be recruited from ''[[cognitive science]]'', then cognitive biology would seem limited to a selection of items in the main set of sciences included by the interdisciplinary concept—[[cognitive psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; These six separate sciences were allied “to bridge the gap between brain and mind” with an [[interdisciplinary]] approach in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Named on page 143 in Miller, George A. "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective." Trends in cognitive sciences 7.3 (2003): 141-144.&lt;/ref&gt; Participating scientists were concerned only with human cognition. As it gained momentum, the growth of cognitive science in subsequent decades seemed to offer a big tent to a variety of researchers.&lt;ref&gt;See first page of Von Eckardt, Barbara. What is cognitive science?. MIT press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Some, for example, considered evolutionary epistemology a fellow-traveler. Others appropriated the keyword, as for example Donald Griffin in 1978, when he advocated the establishment of [[cognitive ethology]].&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, Donald R. "Prospects for a cognitive ethology." Behavioral and Brain Sciences 1.04 (1978): 527-538.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Meanwhile, breakthroughs in [[Molecular biology|molecular]], [[Cell biology|cell]], [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary]], and [[developmental biology]] generated a [[cornucopia]] of data-based theory relevant to cognition. Categorical assignments were [[problematic]]. For example, the decision to append ''cognitive'' to a body of biological research on neurons, e.g. the cognitive biology of neuroscience, is separate from the decision to put such body of research in a category named cognitive sciences. No less difficult a decision needs be made—between the [[Computational biology|computational]] and [[constructivist epistemology|constructivist]]&lt;ref&gt;Stewart, J. (1996). Cognition = life: Implications for higher-level cognition. Behavioural Processes 35: 311-326.&lt;/ref&gt; approach to cognition, and the concomitant issue of [[simulated]] v. [[embodied cognition|embodied]]&lt;ref&gt;Ziemke, Tom (2003). What's that thing called embodiment. In Proceedings of the 25th Annual meeting of the Cognitive Science Society (pp. 1305-1310). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; cognitive models—before appending biology to a body of cognitive research, e.g. the cognitive science of artificial life.
 
One solution is to consider ''cognitive biology'' only as a subset of ''cognitive science''. For example, a major publisher’s website&lt;ref&gt;[55] ''WIRES'' (Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews) (2013). Wiley Online Library. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. http://wires.wiley.com/WileyCDA/&lt;/ref&gt; displays links to material in a dozen domains of major scientific endeavor. One of which is described thus: “Cognitive science is the study of how the mind works, addressing cognitive functions such as perception and action, memory and learning, reasoning and problem solving, decision-making and consciousness.” Upon its selection from the display, the ''Cognitive Science'' page offers in nearly alphabetical order these topics: ''Cognitive Biology'', Computer Science, Economics, Linguistics, Psychology, Philosophy, and Neuroscience. Linked through that list of topics, upon its selection the ''Cognitive Biology'' page offers a selection of reviews and articles with biological content ranging from [[cognitive ethology]]&lt;ref&gt;For consideration of cogbio v cogetho, see p23 in Kamil (1998), “On the Proper Definition of Cognitive Ethology”.&lt;/ref&gt; through [[evolutionary epistemology]]; cognition and art; [[evo-devo]] and cognitive science; [[animal learning]]; genes and cognition; cognition and animal welfare; etc.

A different application of the ''cognitive biology'' category is manifest in the 2009 publication of papers presented at a three-day interdisciplinary workshop on “The New Cognitive Sciences” held at the [[Konrad Lorenz Institute]] for Evolution and Cognition Research in 2006. The papers were listed under four headings, each representing a different domain of requisite cognitive ability: (i) space, (ii) qualities and objects, (iii) numbers and probabilities, and (iv) social entities. The workshop papers examined topics ranging from “Animals as Natural Geometers” and “Color Generalization by Birds” through “Evolutionary Biology of Limited Attention” and “A comparative Perspective on the Origin of Numerical Thinking” as well as “Neuroethology of Attention in Primates” and ten more with less colorful titles. “[O]n the last day of the workshop the participants agreed [that] the title ‘Cognitive Biology’ sounded like a potential candidate to capture the merging of the cognitive and the life sciences that the workshop aimed at representing.”&lt;ref&gt;Tommasi, et al., page x in Preface. See pps 3-11 for a discussion of cognitive science and biology.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the publication of Tommasi, et al. (2009), ''Cognitive Biology: Evolutionary and Developmental Perspectives on Mind, Brain and Behavior.''
 
A final example of categorical use comes from an author’s introduction to his 2011 publication on the subject, ''Cognitive Biology: Dealing with Information from Bacteria to Minds''. After discussing the differences between the cognitive and biological sciences, as well as the value of one to the other, the author concludes: “Thus, the object of this book should be considered as an attempt at building a new discipline, that of ''cognitive biology'', which endeavors to bridge these two domains.”&lt;ref&gt;Author’s italics, p2 in Auletta (2011), Cognitive biology: dealing with information from bacteria to minds.&lt;/ref&gt; There follows a detailed methodology illustrated by examples in biology anchored by concepts from [[cybernetics]] (e.g., self-regulatory systems) and [[quantum information theory]] (regarding probabilistic changes of state) with an invitation "to consider system theory together with information theory as the formal tools that may ground biology and cognition as traditional mathematics grounds physics.”&lt;ref&gt;Auletta (2011), p61. See also, for examples, pps 335 &amp; 340.&lt;/ref&gt;

In standard [[mathematics]], propositions can typically be considered unambiguously true or false. For instance, the proposition ''zero belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply false; while the proposition ''one belongs to the set { 1 }'' is regarded as simply true. However, some mathematicians, computer scientists, and philosophers have been attracted to the idea that a proposition might be ''more or less'' true, rather than wholly true or wholly false. Consider ''My coffee is hot''.

In [[mathematics]], this idea can be developed in terms of [[fuzzy logic]]. In [[computer science]], it has found application in [[artificial intelligence]]. In [[philosophy]], the idea has proved particularly appealing in the case of [[vagueness]]. Degrees of truth is an important concept in law.

'''Ecological design''' is defined by [[Sim Van der Ryn]] and Stuart Cowan as "any form of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts by integrating itself with living processes."&lt;ref&gt;Van der Ryn S, Cowan S(1996). “Ecological Design”. Island Press, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Ecological design is an integrative ecologically responsible design discipline. 

It helps connect scattered efforts in [[green architecture]], [[sustainable agriculture]], [[ecological engineering]], [[ecological restoration]] and other fields. The “eco” prefix was used to ninety sciences including [[eco-city]], eco-management, eco-technique, eco-tecture. It was first used by John Button in 1998. The inchoate developing nature of ecological design was referred to the “adding in “of environmental factor to the design process, but later it was focused on the details of eco-design practice such as product system or individual product or industry as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- This reference cannot be found. Replace with something more accessible.  --&gt;Anne-Marie Willis (1991), “An international Eco Design” conference&lt;/ref&gt;
By including life cycle models through energy and materials flow, ecological design was related to the new [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] subject of [[industrial ecology]]. Industrial ecology meant a conceptual tool emulating models derived from natural ecosystem and a frame work for conceptualizing environmental and technical issues.

Living organisms exist in various systems of balanced symbiotic relationships. The ecological movement of the late twentieth-century is based on understanding that disruptions in these relationships has led to serious breakdown of natural [[ecosystems]]. In human history, technological means have resulted in growth of human populations through fire, implements and weapons. This dramatic increase in explosive population contributed the introduction of mechanical energies in machine production and there have been improvements in mechanized agriculture, manufactured chemical fertilizers and general health measures. Although the earlier invention inclined energy adjusting the ecological balance, population growth following the industrial revolution led to abnormal ecological change.&lt;ref&gt;John McHale (1969), “An Ecological Overview”, in The Future of the Future, New York; George Braziller, pp.66-74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecological design issues and the role of designers==
Since the [[Industrial Revolution]], many propositions in the design field were raised with unsustainable design principles. The architect-designer [[Victor Papanek]] suggested that [[industrial design]] has murdered by creating new species of permanent garbage and by choosing materials and processes that pollute the air.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Papanek (1972), “Design for the Real World: Human Ecological and social change”, Chicago: Academy Edition, ix.&lt;/ref&gt; For these issues, [[R. Buckminster Fuller]], who was invited as University Professor at [[Southern Illinois University]] in Carbondale in 1960s, demonstrated how design could play a central role in identifying major world problems between 1965 and 1975. That included following contents:&lt;ref&gt;[[Victor Margolin]] (1997), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14, 2. pp. 85&lt;/ref&gt;
*Review and analysis of world [[energy resources]]
*Defining more efficient uses of natural resources such as metals
*Integrating machine tools into efficient systems of industrial production
In the 1992 conference, ‘The Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet”, a proposition was put forward that our world is on a path of [[energy production]] and [[energy consumption|consumption]] that cannot be sustained. The report drew attention to Individuals and groups around the world who have a set of principles to develop strategies for change that might be effective in world economics and trade policies, and the design professions will play a role in it. Namely, those meant that design profession becomes not what new products to make, but how to reinvent design culture likely to be realized. He noted designers firstly have to realize that design has historically been a dependent, contingent practice rather than one based on necessity. The design theorist, Clive Dilnot noted design becomes once again a means of ordering the world rather than merely of shaping products.&lt;ref&gt;Clive Dilnot (1982), “Design as a Society Significant Activity: An Introduction”, Design studies 3:2. pp.144&lt;/ref&gt; As a broader approach, the conference of ‘Agenda 21: The Earth Summit Strategy to Save Our Planet’ 1992, emphasized that designers should challenge for facing human problems. These problems were mentioned to six themes: quality of life, efficient use of natural resources, protecting the global commons, managing human settlements, the use of chemicals and the management of human industrial waste, and fostering [[sustainable economic growth]] on a global scale.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Margolin (1988), “Design for a Sustainable World”, Design Issues, vol14,2. pp. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
*1971 [[Ian McHarg]], in his book "Design with Nature", popularized a system of analyzing the layers of a site in order to compile a complete understanding of the qualitative attributes of a place. McHarg gave every qualitative aspect of the site a layer, such as the history, hydrology, topography, vegetation, etc.  This system became the foundation of today's [[Geographic Information Systems]] (GIS), a ubiquitous tool used in the practice of ecological landscape design.
*1978 [[Permaculture]].  Bill Mollison and David Holmgren coin the phrase for a system of designing regenerative human ecosystems.  (Founded in the work of Fukuoka, Yeoman, Smith, etc..
*1994  [[David Orr]], in his book "Earth in Mind: On Education, Environment, and the Human Prospect", compiled a series of essays on "ecolgocial design intelligence" and its power to create healthy, durable, resilient, just, and prosperous communities.
*1994  Canadian biologists [[John Todd (Canadian biologist)|John Todd]] and Nancy Jack Todd, in their book "From Eco-Cities to Living Machines" describe the precepts of ecological design.
*2000 [[Ecosa Institute]] begins offering an [http://ecosa.org/ecological-design-certificate-program/ Ecological Design Certificate], teaching designers to design with nature.
*2004 [[Fritjof Capra]], in his book "The Hidden Connections: A Science for Sustainable Living", wrote this primer on the science of [[living systems]] and considers the application of new thinking by life scientists to our understanding of social organization.
*2004 K. Ausebel compiled compelling personal stories of the world's most innovative ecological designers in "Nature's Operating Instructions."

==Influence==
There are some clothing companies that are using several ecological design methods to change the future of the textile industry into a more environmentally friendly one. Recycling used clothing to minimize the use of resources, using [[biodegradation|biodegradable]] textile materials to reduce the impact on the environment, and using plant dyes instead of poisonous chemicals to improve the appearance of fabric.&lt;ref&gt;Taieb, Amine Hadj et al. (2010). "Sensitising Children to Ecological Issues through Textile Eco-Design". International Journal of Art &amp; Design Education, vol. 29, 3. p313-320&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5698">'''Ecopoetry''' is [[poetry]] with a strong [[ecological]] emphasis or message. Many [[poets]], [[poems]] and books of poems have expressed ecological concerns; but only recently has the term ''ecopoetry'' gained use.  There is now, in English-speaking poetry, a recognisable sub[[genre]] of ecopoetry.

Prior to the term, a number of poems had ecological messages. Although these poets did not mention the word, they were clearly 'Ecopoetic' in stance and exerted an influence on the subsequent subgenre.  Examples include: ''The White Poem'' by Jay Ramsay &amp; Carole Bruce (Rivelin Grapheme Press, 1988), ''Bosco'' (Hearing Eye, 1999; 2001)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=authC2D9C28B0c54816E6EhGs14087F4 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070203183320/http://www.contemporarywriters.com/authors/?p=authC2D9C28B0c54816E6EhGs14087F4 |archivedate=2007-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and (more recently) ''Heavy Water: a poem for Chernobyl'' (Enitharmon Press, 2004).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.enitharmon.co.uk/books/viewBook.asp?BID=97 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070822000957/http://www.enitharmon.co.uk/books/viewBook.asp?BID=97 |archivedate=2007-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of a number of seminal texts helping to introduce the term into wider, critical use was ''Ecopoetry: a Critical Introduction'' edited by J. Scott Bryson (2002).  Another example of the burgeoning use of the term at the millennial turn was the journal ''[[Ecopoetics (journal)|Ecopoetics]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecopoetics.org/ ''Ecopoetics'']&lt;/ref&gt; which broadened the term from poetry into ''[[poiesis]]'' interpreted as making or writing more generally.

Since then, a spate of poetry anthologies and books has appeared, either employing the word explicitly or using the idea as a guiding principle.  Recent instances include [[Alice Oswald]]'s ''The Thunder Mutters'' (2005), [[Forrest Gander]] &amp; John Kinsella's ''Redstart: an Ecological Poetics'', and the ground-breaking ''Earth Shattering: Ecopoems'', edited by [[Neil Astley]] at [[Bloodaxe Books]] (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852247746 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818111930/http://www.bloodaxebooks.com/titlepage.asp?isbn=1852247746 |archivedate=2007-08-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the chief characteristics of ecopoetry, as defined by James Engelhardt, is that it is connected to the world in a way that implies responsibility.  As with other models that explore and assume engagement ([[Marxism]], [[feminism]], etc.), Ecopoetry is "surrounded by questions of ethics".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octopusmagazine.com/issue09/engelhardt.htm|title=Welcome octopusmagazine.com - BlueHost.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a means of describing poetry or poetic projects that embrace the ecological imperative for personal sensitivity and social change, ecopoetry has been cited by such writers as [[John Burnside (writer)|John Burnside]] and [[Mario Petrucci]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.archive.poetrysociety.org.uk/content/poetry-class&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Edging''', '''peaking''', or '''surfing''',&lt;ref name=Bodansky&gt;''Extended Massive Orgasm'', Steve and Vera Bodansky, (2000), pp. 91, 92, 94–98, {{ISBN|0-89793-289-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a orgasm control sexual technique which may be practiced either alone or with a partner and involves the maintenance of a high level of [[sexual arousal]] for an extended period of time without reaching [[Orgasm|climax]].

When practiced by males, orgasm control allows the practitioner to enjoy direct sexual stimulation without waiting through the refractory period common after orgasm. When the decision is made to allow orgasm, the physical sensations may be much greater and more pleasurable than if the orgasm were experienced conventionally. Orgasm control is referenced as 'slow masturbation' in [[Alex Comfort]]'s ''The New Joy of Sex'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;''The New Joy of Sex'', [[Alex Comfort]], (1993), {{ISBN|1-85732-097-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 'extended massive orgasm' in Vera and Steve Bodansky's 2000 book of the same name,&lt;ref name=Bodansky/&gt; and is similar to the [[Venus Butterfly]] technique used in the volume ''The One Hour Orgasm'' (1988) by Leah and Bob Schwartz.

Since orgasm control prolongs the experience of powerful sexual sensations occurring during the final build-up to orgasm, the physical demands of being kept or keeping oneself in this highly excited state for an extended time can induce a pleasurable, almost euphoric state.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Orgasm control can involve either [[sex partner]] being in control of the other partner's orgasm, or a person delaying their own orgasm during [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] with a partner or by [[masturbation]]. To experience orgasm control, any method of [[sexual stimulation]] can be used.

== In partnered sex ==
When shared in sexual activity between partners, one partner would stimulate the other, gradually bringing them up to the point high in the plateau phase where an orgasm is actually building, and will then reduce the level of stimulation to just below that needed to trigger the orgasm. If control of the orgasm is given to a partner and orgasm is not allowed for a time in order to develop an increased level of sexual tension, it is referred to as [[erotic sexual denial]]. By carefully varying the intensity and speed of stimulation, and by practicing with the same partner to learn his or her responses, a person can be held in the highly aroused state near orgasm. This process may be repeated as desired, but at some point repetition may cause the urge to orgasm to become overwhelming. When a partner eventually provides enough stimulation to achieve an orgasm, it may be stronger than usual due to the increased tension and [[Sexual arousal|arousal]] that builds up during the extended stimulation. If the partner whose orgasm is being controlled, sometimes referred to as the [[submissive]] partner, is [[Bondage (sexual)|tied up]], it may better control the orgasm (the activity is sometimes called [[Erotic sexual denial#Tie and tease|tie and tease]] and if orgasm is denied it is [[tease and denial]]). Another possibility is for one partner to help produce [[multiple orgasm]]s in the other.

== In masturbation ==
{{original research|date=November 2010}}
When practiced alone, orgasm control is beneficial for heightening sexual pleasure as well as a training tool which permits the practitioner to increase the duration of sex with a partner.{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} For the female, because there is little or no post-orgasm refractory period, the practitioner can enjoy direct sexual stimulation for longer periods of time, as well as with increased frequency and intensity. For the male, the speed of the rubbing or stroking of the penis may vary to navigate right to the edge of ejaculation. With orgasm control, a male can experience a longer or more intense orgasm, as well as a larger volume of semen expelled during his ejaculation. Because solo masturbation allows for precise control over the feelings, the timing, and the speed of stimulation, many people practice orgasmic control by themselves. One technique, commonly referred to as 'edging', involves masturbating up until the moment before reaching the plateau phase just before orgasm occurs, and then stopping suddenly before experiencing a climax. Another technique, commonly referred to as 'surfing', involves reaching the plateau phase and slowing down the stimulation to maintain a heightened level of sensation for an extended time. Repeating either of these techniques many times during a single masturbation session may result in a stronger, more intense orgasm.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Many individuals{{who|date=January 2014}} assert that orgasm control is more often possible with [[masturbation]]. This is a direct result of the fact that one is then able to control the intensity and duration of stimulation without having to rely on the partner stopping or changing the type of stimulation in order to postpone the orgasm. Masturbation is then the easy way to learn one's limits and could also be seen as the starting point in the technique of orgasm control.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Orgasm control is most easily learned through solitary masturbation, although many individuals enjoy including elements of orgasm control in sex with a partner. Masturbation provides the individual with the opportunity of learning about their bodies and the amount of pleasure they can experience without reaching orgasm. Self-stimulation can help both men and women acknowledge the limits of their body and the techniques that may help them in controlling their orgasms.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

As it has been described by Steve Bodansky and Vera Bodansky in ''Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure'', masturbation practiced with the aim of orgasm control must be carried on with the purpose of making every stroke feel exquisite and not to relieve tension, as 'simple' masturbation does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JqiXUjILAlQC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;dq=steve+and+orgasm+familiarity#v=onepage&amp;q=chapter%205&amp;f=false|title=Extended Massive Orgasm: How You Can Give and Receive Intense Sexual Pleasure|date=2000-11-01|accessdate= 2010-07-27|isbn=9780897932899|author1=Bodansky|first1=Steve|last2=Bodansky|first2=Vera}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to practice this other type of masturbation, the same authors suggest gradual stimulation of the [[genitals]] and then making connections between the primary area ([[Human penis|penis]] or [[clitoris]]) and the secondary area ([[lip]]s, [[nipple]] or other part of the body that is an [[erogenous zone]]). The connection between the two areas is established once the individual stimulates them with exactly the same moves of the same intensity.

'''Environmental health''' is the branch of [[public health]] concerned with all aspects of the [[natural environment|natural]] and [[built environment]] affecting human health. Other terms referring to or concerning environmental health are '''environmental public health''', and '''public health protection/''' '''environmental health protection'''. Environmental health is focused on the natural and built environments for the benefit of human health, whereas [[environmental protection]] is concerned with protecting the natural environment for the benefit of human health and the ecosystem.

==Definitions==
Environmental health has been defined in a 1999 document by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) as:
:Those aspects of the [[human health]] and disease that are determined by factors in the environment. It also refers to the theory and practice of assessing and controlling factors in the environment that can potentially affect health.

:Environmental health as used by the WHO Regional Office for Europe, includes both the direct pathological effects of chemicals, radiation and some biological agents, and the effects (often indirect) on health and well being of the broad physical, psychological, social and cultural environment, which includes housing, urban development, land use and transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Novice| first = Robert (editor) | title = Overview of the environment and health in Europe in the 1990s| work = | publisher = World Health Organization| date =  1999-03-29| url = http://www.euro.who.int/document/e66792.pdf| format = PDF | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2016 the WHO website on environmental health states "Environmental health addresses all the physical, chemical, and biological factors external to a person, and all the related factors impacting behaviours. It encompasses the assessment and control of those environmental factors that can potentially affect health. It is targeted towards preventing disease and creating health-supportive environments. This definition excludes behaviour not related to environment, as well as behaviour related to the social and cultural environment, as well as genetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Health topics: Environmental health| url = http://www.who.int/topics/environmental_health/en/|author=WHO|date=n.d.|accessdate=10 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO has also defined environmental health services as "those services which implement environmental health policies through monitoring and control activities. They also carry out that role by promoting the improvement of environmental parameters and by encouraging the use of environmentally friendly and healthy technologies and behaviors. They also have a leading role in developing and suggesting new policy areas."{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The term [[environmental medicine]] may be seen as a medical specialty, or branch of the broader field of environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Terminology is not fully established, and in many European countries they are used interchangeably.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Environmental health profession==
Environmental health professionals may be known as [[environmental health officer]]s, public health inspectors, environmental health specialists, environmental health practitioners, or sanitarians. Researchers and policy-makers also play important roles in how environmental health is practiced in the field. In many European countries, physicians and veterinarians are involved in environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} In the [[United Kingdom]], practitioners must have a graduate degree in environmental health and be certified and registered with the Chartered Institute of Environmental Health or the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nationalcareersservice.direct.gov.uk/advice/planning/jobprofiles/Pages/environmentalhealthofficer.aspx |title=Job Profiles: Environmental health officer| publisher=National Careers Service (UK) |accessdate=17 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, practitioners in environmental health are required to obtain an approved bachelor's degree in environmental health along with the national professional certificate, the Certificate in Public Health Inspection (Canada) [[CPHI(C)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ciphi.ca |title=Canadian Institute of Public Health Inspectors | accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many states in the [[United States]] also require that individuals have a bachelor's degree and professional [[license]]s in order to practice environmental health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} [[California]] state law defines the scope of practice of environmental health as follows:&lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code, section 106615(e)&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Scope of practice in environmental health" means the practice of environmental health by registered environmental health specialists in the public and private sector within the meaning of this article and includes, but is not limited to, organization, management, education, enforcement, consultation, and emergency response for the purpose of prevention of environmental health hazards and the promotion and protection of the public health and the environment in the following areas: food protection; housing; institutional environmental health; land use; community noise control; recreational swimming areas and waters; electromagnetic radiation control; solid, liquid, and hazardous materials management; underground storage tank control; onsite septic systems; vector control; drinking water quality; water sanitation; emergency preparedness; and milk and dairy sanitation pursuant to Section 33113 of the Food and Agricultural Code.

The environmental health [[profession]] had its modern-day roots in the sanitary and public health movement of the United Kingdom. This was epitomized by [[Edwin Chadwick|Sir Edwin Chadwick]], who was instrumental in the repeal of the [[poor law]]s, and in 1884 was the founding president of the Association of Public Sanitary Inspectors, now called the [[Chartered Institute of Environmental Health]].{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

== Disciplines ==

Five basic disciplines generally contribute to the field of environmental health: environmental epidemiology, toxicology, exposure science, environmental engineering, and environmental law. Each of these disciplines contributes different information to describe problems and solutions in environmental health, but there is some overlap among them.
:*[[Environmental epidemiology]] studies the relationship between environmental exposures (including exposure to chemicals, radiation, microbiological agents, etc.) and human health. Observational studies, which simply observe exposures that people have already experienced, are common in environmental epidemiology because humans cannot ethically be exposed to agents that are known or suspected to cause disease. While the inability to use experimental study designs is a limitation of environmental epidemiology, this discipline directly observes effects on human health rather than estimating effects from animal studies.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Toxicology]] studies how environmental exposures lead to specific health outcomes, generally in animals, as a means to understand possible health outcomes in humans. Toxicology has the advantage of being able to conduct randomized controlled trials and other experimental studies because they can use animal subjects. However there are many differences in animal and human biology, and there can be a lot of uncertainty when interpreting the results of [[animal studies]] for their implications for human health.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Exposure science]] studies human exposure to environmental contaminants by both identifying and quantifying exposures. Exposure science can be used to support environmental epidemiology by better describing environmental exposures that may lead to a particular health outcome,identify common exposures whose health outcomes may be better understood through a toxicology study, or can be used in a risk assessment to determine whether current levels of exposure might exceed recommended levels. Exposure science has the advantage of being able to very accurately quantify exposures to specific chemicals, but it does not generate any information about health outcomes like environmental epidemiology or toxicology.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}
:*[[Environmental engineering]] applies scientific and engineering principles for protection of human populations from the effects of adverse environmental factors; protection of environments from potentially deleterious effects of natural and human activities; and general improvement of environmental quality.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
:*[[Environmental law]] includes the network of treaties, statutes, regulations, common and customary laws addressing the effects of human activity on the natural environment.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Information from epidemiology, toxicology, and exposure science can be combined to conduct a [[risk assessment]] for specific chemicals, mixtures of chemicals or other risk factors to determine whether an exposure poses significant risk to human health (exposure would likely result in the development of [[List_of_pollution-related_diseases|pollution-related diseases]]). This can in turn be used to develop and implement environmental health policy that, for example, regulates chemical emissions, or imposes standards for proper [[sanitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uTgSBW8jE8QC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=environmental%20health%20from%20global%20to%20local%20by%20howard%20frumkin&amp;f=false|title= Environmental Health: from Global to Local|edition=2 Editor= Howard Frumkin|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons|location= San Francisco|year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=January 2015}} Actions of engineering and law can be combined to provide [[risk management]] to minimize, monitor, and otherwise manage the impact of exposure to protect human health to achieve the objectives of environmental health policy.

==Concerns==
{{prose|date=January 2015}}
Environmental health addresses all human-health-related aspects of the natural environment and the built environment. Environmental health concerns include:

* [[Air quality]], including both ambient outdoor air and [[indoor air quality]], which also comprises concerns about [[environmental tobacco smoke]].
* [[Biosafety]]
* [[Effects of climate change on human health|Climate change and its effects on health]].
* [[Disaster preparedness]] and response.
* [[Food safety]], including in [[agriculture]], [[transportation]], [[food processing]], [[wholesale]] and [[retail]] distribution and sale.
* [[Hazardous materials]] management, including [[hazardous waste]] management, contaminated site remediation, the prevention of leaks from [[underground storage tank]]s and the prevention of hazardous materials releases to the environment and responses to emergency situations resulting from such releases.
* [[House|Housing]], including [[substandard housing]] abatement and the inspection of [[jails]] and [[prisons]].
* Childhood [[lead poisoning]] prevention.
* [[Land use planning]], including [[smart growth]].
* Liquid waste disposal, including city [[waste water treatment]] plants and on-site waste water disposal systems, such as [[septic tank]] systems and [[chemical toilet]]s.
* [[Medical waste]] management and disposal.
* [[Noise pollution]] control.
* [[Occupational health]] and [[industrial hygiene]].
* Radiological health, including exposure to [[ionizing radiation]] from [[X-rays]] or [[radioactive isotopes]].
* Recreational water illness prevention, including from [[swimming pools]], spas and [[ocean]] and [[freshwater]] bathing places.
* Safe [[drinking water]].
* [[Solid waste management]], including [[landfill]]s, [[recycling]] facilities, [[composting]] and solid waste transfer stations.
* [[Toxic]] chemical exposure whether in [[consumer products]], housing, workplaces, air, water or soil.
* [[Vector control]], including the control of [[mosquitoes]], [[rodents]], [[flies]], [[cockroach]]es and other animals that may transmit [[pathogens]].

According to recent estimates, about 5 to 10% of [[Disability-adjusted life year]]s (DALYs) lost are due to environmental causes in Europe. By far the most important factor is fine [[Atmospheric particulate matter|particulate matter]] pollution in urban air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eea.europa.eu/soer/countries/nl/national-and-regional-story-netherlands-1 National and regional story (Netherlands) - Environmental burden of disease in Europe: the Abode project]. EEA.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, environmental exposures have been estimated to contribute to 4.9 million (8.7%) deaths and 86 million (5.7%) [[DALYs]] globally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ehjournal.net/content/10/1/9 Knows and unknowns on burden of disease due to chemicals: a systematic review]. Press-Ustinov, A., et al. 2011. Environmental Health 10:9.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Superfund sites created by various companies have been found to be hazardous to human and environmental health in nearby communities. It was this perceived threat, raising the specter of miscarriages, mutations, birth defects, and cancers that most frightened the public.&lt;ref&gt;Schleicher, D. (1995). Superfund’s Abandoned Hazardous Waste Sites. In A. Wildavsky (Ed.), But Is it True?: A Citizen’s Guide to Environmental Health and Safety Issues (153-184) . Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

The Toxicology and Environmental Health Information Program (TEHIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sis.nlm.nih.gov/enviro.html |title=TEHIP|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a comprehensive toxicology and environmental health web site, that includes open access to resources produced by US government agencies and organizations, and is maintained under the umbrella of the Specialized Information Service at the [[United States National Library of Medicine]]. TEHIP includes links to technical databases, bibliographies, tutorials, and consumer-oriented resources. 
TEHIP is responsible for the [[Toxicology Data Network]] (TOXNET),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov/|title=TOXNET|publisher= United States National Library of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; an integrated system of toxicology and environmental health databases including the [[Hazardous Substances Data Bank]], that are open access, i.e. available free of charge.

==Mapping==

There are many environmental health mapping tools. [[TOXMAP]] is a geographic information system (GIS) from the Division of Specialized Information Services&lt;ref&gt;[http://sis.nlm.nih.gov sis.nlm.nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; of the United States National Library of Medicine (NLM) that uses maps of the United States to help users visually explore data from the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) [[Toxics Release Inventory]] and [[Superfund Basic Research Program]]s. TOXMAP is a resource funded by the US federal government. TOXMAP's chemical and environmental health information is taken from the NLM's Toxicology Data Network (TOXNET)&lt;ref&gt;[http://toxnet.nlm.nih.gov toxnet.nlm.nih.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[PubMed]], and from other authoritative sources.

'''Escapist fiction''' is [[fiction]] that provides a psychological escape from thoughts of everyday life by immersing the reader in exotic situations or activities.

The term is not used favorably, though the condemnation contained in it may be slight. Those who defend works described as escapist from the charge either assert that they are not escapist—such as that a [[science fiction]] novel's satiric aspects address real life—or defend the notion of "escape" as such, not "escapism"—as in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s "[[On Fairy-Stories]]" and [[C. S. Lewis]]'s quotation, in his "On Science Fiction" of Tolkien's question of who would be most hostile to the idea of escape, and his answer: jailers.

Genres that can include elements of escapist fiction include:
* [[Bodice ripper]]s/[[Romance novel]]s
* [[Detective novel]]s
* [[Fantasy fiction]]
* [[Horror fiction]]
* [[Pulp magazines|Pulp fiction]]
* [[Science fiction]]
* [[Spy novel]]s
* [[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]s

'''Euhemerism''' ({{IPAc-en|j|uː|ˈ|h|iː|m|ər|ɪ|z|əm|,_|-|h|ɛ|m|-}}) is an approach to the interpretation of [[mythology]] in which mythological accounts are presumed to have originated from real historical events or personages. Euhemerism supposes that historical accounts become myths as they are exaggerated in the retelling, accumulating elaborations and alterations that reflect cultural [[mores]]. It was named for the Greek mythographer [[Euhemerus]], who lived in the late 4th century BC. In the more recent literature of myth, such as ''[[Bulfinch's Mythology]]'', euhemerism is termed the "historical theory" of mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Bulfinch, Thomas. ''Bulfinch's Mythology''. Whitefish: Kessinger, 2004, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Euhemerus was not the first to attempt to rationalize mythology in historical terms, as euhemeristic views are found in earlier writings including those of [[Xenophanes]], [[Herodotus]], [[Hecataeus of Abdera]] and [[Ephorus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis: "Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete" The Classical Journal 63.8 (May 1968, pp. 337–340) p.338.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Herodotus]] presented rationalized accounts of the myth of [[Io (mythology)|Io]] (''Histories'' I.1ff) and events of the Trojan War (''Histories'' 2.118ff).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the enduring influence of Euhemerus upon later thinkers such as [[Ennius]] and [[Antoine Banier]] identified him as the traditional founder of this school of thought.&lt;ref&gt;''An introduction to mythology'', [[Lewis Spence]], 1921, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early history ==

In a scene described in Plato's ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]'', [[Socrates]] offers a euhemeristic interpretation of a myth concerning [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] and [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]:

{{quote|"{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Tell me, Socrates, isn't it from somewhere near this stretch of the Ilisus that people say Boreas carried Orithyia away?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: So they say.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: Couldn't this be the very spot? The stream is lovely, pure and clear: just right for girls to be playing nearby.&lt;br&gt; {{smallcaps|Socrates}}: No, it is two or three hundred yards farther downstream, where one crosses to get to the district of Arga. I think there is even an altar to Boreas there.&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Phaedrus}}: I hadn't noticed it. But tell me, Socrates, in the name of Zeus, do you really believe that legend is true?&lt;br&gt;
{{smallcaps|Socrates}}: Actually, it would not be out of place for me to reject it, as our intellectuals do. I could then tell a clever story: I could claim that a gust of the North Wind blew her over the rocks where she was playing with Pharmaceia; and once she was killed that way people said she had been carried off by Boreas..."&lt;ref&gt;Plato, Phaedr. 229b–d, translation taken from:

Socrates illustrates a euhemeristic approach to the myth of [[Boreas (god)|Boreas]] abducting [[Orithyia (Athenian)|Orithyia]]. He shows how the story of Boreas, the northern wind, can be rationalised: Orithyia is pushed off the rock cliffs through the equation of Boreas with a natural gust of wind, which accepts Orithyia as a historical personage. But here he also implies that this is equivalent to rejecting the myth. Socrates, despite holding some euhemeristic views, mocked the concept that all myths could be rationalized, noting that the mythical creatures of "absurd forms" such as [[Centaurs]] and the [[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]] could not easily be explained.&lt;ref&gt;''Phaedrus'', 229d&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ancient [[skeptic]] philosophical tradition of [[Theodorus the Atheist|Theodorus of Cyrene]] and the [[Cyrenaics]], Euhemerus forged a new method of interpretation for the contemporary religious beliefs. Though his work is lost, the reputation of Euhemerus was that he believed that much of [[Greek mythology]] could be interpreted as natural or historical events subsequently given supernatural characteristics through retelling. Subsequently Euhemerus was considered to be an [[atheism|atheist]] by his opponents, most notably [[Callimachus]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Spyridakis, 1968, pp.&amp;nbsp;338–339.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deification===

Euhemerus' views were rooted in the deification of men, usually kings, into gods through [[apotheosis]]. In numerous cultures, kings were exalted or venerated into the status of divine beings and worshipped after their death, or sometimes even while they ruled. [[Dion of Syracuse|Dion]], the tyrant ruler of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], was deified while he was alive and modern scholars consider his apotheosis to have influenced Euhemerus' views on the origin of all gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerus in Context, Franco De Angelis De Angelis and Benjamin Garstad, Classical Antiquity,Vol. 25, No. 2, October 2006, pp. 211–242.&lt;/ref&gt; Euhemerus was also living during the contemporaneous deification of the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]] and "[[pharaoh|pharaoization]]" of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty|Ptolemies]] in a fusion of Hellenic and Egyptian traditions.

===Tomb of Zeus===

Euhemerus argued that [[Zeus]] was a mortal king who died on [[Crete]], and that his tomb could still be found there with the inscription bearing his name.&lt;ref&gt;''Zeus Is Dead: Euhemerus and Crete'', S. Spyridakis, The Classical Journal, Vol. 63, No. 8, May, 1968, pp. 337–340.&lt;/ref&gt; This claim however did not originate with Euhemerus, as the general sentiment of Crete during the time of [[Epimenides]] of [[Knossos]] (c.&amp;nbsp;600 BC) was that Zeus was buried somewhere in Crete. For this reason, the Cretans were often considered [[Atheism|atheists]], and Epimenides called them all liars (see [[Epimenides paradox]]). [[Callimachus]], an opponent of Euhemerus' views on [[mythology]], argued that Zeus' Cretan tomb was fabricated, and that he was eternal:

{{cquote|''Cretans always lie.'' For the Cretans even built a tomb,&lt;br&gt; 
Lord, for you. But you did not die, for you are eternal.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachus, ''Hymn to Zeus''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A later Latin [[scholia|scholium]] on the ''Hymns'' of Callimachus attempted to account for the tomb of Zeus. According to the scholium, the original tomb inscription read: "The tomb of [[Minos]], the son of [[jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]" but over time the words "Minos, the son" wore away leaving only "the tomb of Jupiter".  This had misled the Cretans into thinking that Zeus had died and was buried there.&lt;ref&gt;The hymns of Callimachus, tr. into Engl. verse, with notes. To which are added, Select epigrams, and the ''Coma Berenices'' of the same author, six hymns of Orpheus, and the ''Encomium of Ptolemy'' by Theocritus, by W. Dodd, 1755, p. 3, footnote.&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by Euhemerus, [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] in the 3rd century AD claimed that [[Pythagoras]] had discovered the tomb of Zeus on Crete and written on the tomb's surface an inscription reading: "Here died and was buried Zan, whom they call Zeus".&lt;ref&gt;Epilegomena to the Study of Greek Religions and Themis a Study of the Social Origins of Greek Religion, Jane Ellen Harrison, Kessinger Publishing, 2003, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]] also wrote about the tomb of Zeus.

==Christians==

Hostile to paganism, the early Christians, such as the [[Church Fathers]], embraced euhemerism in attempt to undermine the validity of pagan gods.&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, p. 397.&lt;/ref&gt; The usefulness of euhemerist views to early Christian apologists may be summed up in [[Clement of Alexandria]]'s triumphant cry in ''Cohortatio ad gentes'': "Those to whom you bow were once men like yourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Seznec (1995) ''The Survival of the Pagan Gods'' Princeton University Press pg 12, who observes (p. 13) of the numerous Christian examples he mentions, "Thus Euhemerism became a favorite weapon of the Christian polemicists, a weapon they made use of at every turn".&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Book of Wisdom===
The ''[[Book of Wisdom|Wisdom of Solomon]]'', a [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical book]], has a passage, {{bibleref|Wisdom|14:12–21}}, giving a euhemerist explanation of the origin of idols.{{wikisource|Wisdom (Bible)}}

===Early Christian apologists===

The [[Early Christianity|early Christian]] [[Christian apologetics|apologists]] deployed the euhemerist argument to support their position that pagan mythology was merely an aggregate of [[fable]]s of human invention. [[Cyprian]], a North African convert to Christianity, wrote a short essay ''De idolorum vanitate'' ("On the Vanity of Idols") in AD 247 that assumes the euhemeristic rationale as though it needed no demonstration. Cyprian begins:

{{quote|That those are no gods whom the common people worship, is known from this: they were formerly kings, who on account of their royal memory subsequently began to be adored by their people even in death. Thence temples were founded to them; thence images were sculptured to retain the countenances of the deceased by the likeness; and men sacrificed victims, and celebrated festal days, by way of giving them honour. Thence to posterity those rites became sacred, which at first had been adopted as a consolation.}}

Cyprian proceeds directly to examples, the [[apotheosis]] of [[Melicertes]] and [[Leucothea]]; "The Castors [i.e. [[Castor and Pollux]]] die by turns, that they may live," a reference to the daily sharing back and forth of their immortality by the Heavenly Twins. "The cave of Jupiter is to be seen in Crete, and his sepulchre is shown," Cyprian says, confounding Zeus and [[Dionysus]] but showing that the [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] cave cult was still alive in Crete in the third century AD. In his exposition, it is to Cyprian's argument to marginalize the [[syncretism]] of pagan belief, in order to emphasize the individual variety of local deities:

{{quote|From this the religion of the gods is variously changed among individual nations and provinces, inasmuch as no one god is worshipped by all, but by each one the worship of its own ancestors is kept peculiar.}}

Eusebius in his ''[[Chronicon (Eusebius)|Chronicle]]'' employed euhemerism to argue the Babylonian God [[Baʿal]] was a deified ruler and that the god [[Belus (Assyrian)|Belus]] was the first Assyrian king.&lt;ref&gt;Chronicon, Pat. Graeca XIX, cols. 132, 133, i. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Euhemeristic views are found expressed also in [[Tertullian]] (''De idololatria''), the ''Octavius'' of [[Marcus Minucius Felix]] and in [[Origen]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism and Christology in Origen: "Contra Celsum" III 22–43, Harry Y. Gamble, Vigiliae Christianae, Vol. 33, No. 1, Mar., 1979, pp. 12–29.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]]' dismissal of paganism in the fifth century, on rationalizing grounds, may have depended on a reading of Cyprian, with the details enormously expanded. [[Isidore of Seville]], compiler of the most influential early medieval encyclopedia, devoted a chapter ''De diis gentium''&lt;ref&gt;Isidore, ''[[Etymologiae]]'', book viii, ch. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; to elucidating, with numerous examples and elaborated genealogies of gods, the principle drawn from [[Lactantius]], ''Quos pagani deos asserunt, homines olim fuisse produntur.'' ("Those whom pagans claim to be gods were once mere men.") Elaborating logically, he attempted to place these deified men in the six great periods of history as he divided it, and created mythological dynasties. Isidore's euhemeristic bent was codified in a rigid parallel with sacred history in [[Petrus Comestor]]'s appendix to his much translated ''Historia scholastica'' (written ca. 1160), further condensing Isidore to provide strict parallels of figures from the pagan [[legend]], as it was now viewed in historicised narrative, and the mighty human spirits of the patriarchs of the [[Old Testament]].&lt;ref&gt;Seznec 1995:16.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin of Braga]] in his ''De correctione rusticorum'' wrote idolatry stemmed from post-deluge survivors of Noah's family who began to worship the [[Sun]] and stars instead of [[deity|God]]. In his view the Greek gods were deified descendants of [[Noah]] who were once real personages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libro.uca.edu/mckenna/pagan4.htm#N_64_|title=Chapter 4: Pagan Survivals in Galicia in the Sixth Century|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle Ages===

Christian writers during the [[Middle Ages]] continued to embrace euhemerism, such as [[Vincent of Beauvais]], [[Petrus Comestor]], [[Roger Bacon]] and [[Godfrey of Viterbo]].&lt;ref&gt;Euhemerism: A Mediaeval Interpretation of Classical Paganism, John Daniel Cooke, Speculum, Vol. 2, No. 4, Oct., 1927, pp. 396–410.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Franciscan friar [[Roger Bacon]] in the 13th century argued that ancient Gods such as [[Minerva]], [[Prometheus]], Atlas, [[Apollo]], [[Io (mythology)|Io]] and [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] were all deified humans. – ''Opus Maius'', ed. J. H. Bridges, Oxford, 1897, pp. 46–47.&lt;/ref&gt;
“After all, it was during this time that Christian apologists had adopted the views of the rationalist Greek philosophers. And had captured the purpose for Euhemerism, which was to explain the mundane origins of the Hellenistic divinities. Euhemerism explained simply in two ways: first in the strictest sense as a movement which reflected the known views of Euhemerus' Hiera Anagraphe regarding Panchaia and the historicity of the family of Saturn and Uranus. The principal sources of these views are the handed-down accounts of Lactantius and Diodorus; or second, in the widest sense, as a rationalist movement which sought to explain the mundane origins of all the Hellenistic gods and heroes as mortals.” Other modern theorists labeled Euhemerism as a “subject of classical paganism that was fostered in the minds of the people of the Middle Ages through the realization that while in most respects the ancient Greeks and Roman had  been superior to themselves, they had been in error regarding their religious beliefs. An examination of the principal writings in Middle English with considerable reading of literature other than English, discloses the fact that the people of the Middle Ages rarely regarded the so-called gods as mere figments of the imagination but rather believed that they were or had been real beings, sometimes possessing actual power.” (John Daniel Cook)

===Christ myth theory===

In his 2011 book, ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', [[Robert M. Price]] supported the [[Christ myth theory]] and suggested that the process of searching for a historical Jesus was like euhemerism.&lt;ref&gt;Price, Robert M, ( 2011) ''The Christ-Myth Theory and Its Problems'', American Atheist Press. {{ISBN|1-57884-017-1}} p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Snorri Sturluson's "euhemerism"==
In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', composed around 1220, the Christian Icelandic bard and historian [[Snorri Sturluson]] proposes that the Norse gods were originally historical leaders and kings. [[Odin]], the father of the gods, is introduced as a historical person originally from [[Asia Minor]], tracing his ancestry back to [[Priam]], the king of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]]. 
As Odin travels north to settle in the [[Nordic countries]], he establishes the royal families ruling in [[Denmark]], [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] at the time:

{{quote|And whatever countries they passed through, great glory was spoken of them, so that they seemed more like gods than men.&lt;ref&gt;Snorri Sturluson, trans. Anthony Faulkes, ''Edda''. Everyman. 1987. (Prologue, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, while Snorri's euhemerism follows the early Christian tradition, the effect is not simply to discredit the divinity of the gods of a religion on the wane, but also (on the model of [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'') to hint that the 'divinisation' was done in order to legitimize more recent Scandinavian rulers.

==In the modern world==

Euhemeristic interpretations of mythology continued throughout the [[early modern period]] from the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;For example in the preface to [[Arthur Golding]]'s 1567 translation of [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' into English, Golding offers a rationale for contemporary Christian readers to interpret Ovid's pagan stories. He argues: 'The true and everliving God the [[Paynim]]s did not know: Which caused them the name of Gods on creatures to bestow'.&lt;/ref&gt; to modern times. In 1711, the French historian [[Antoine Banier]] in his ''Mythologie et la fable expliqués par l'histoire'' ("The mythology and fables of the ancients, explained") presented strong arguments for a euhemerist interpretation of Greek mythology.&lt;ref&gt;''The rise of modern mythology, 1680–1860'', Burton Feldman, Robert D. Richardson'', Indiana University Press, 2000, p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jacob Bryant]]'s ''A New System or Analysis of Ancient Mythology'' (1744) was also another key work on euhemerism of the period, but argued so from a Biblical basis. Of the early 19th century, [[George Stanley Faber]] was another Biblical euhemerist. His work ''The Origin of Pagan Idolatry'' (1816) proposed that all the pagan nations worshipped the same gods, who were all deified men. Outside of Biblical influenced literature, some archaeologists embraced euhemerist views since they discovered myths could verify archaeological findings. [[Heinrich Schliemann]] was a prominent archaeologist of the 19th century who argued myths had embedded historical truths. Schliemann was an advocate of the historical reality of places and characters mentioned in the works of [[Homer]]. He excavated [[Troy]] and claimed to have discovered artifacts associated with various figures from Greek mythology, including the [[Mask of Agamemnon]] and [[Priam's Treasure]].

[[Herbert Spencer]] embraced some euhemeristic arguments in attempt to explain the anthropocentric origin of religion, through [[Veneration of the dead|ancestor worship]]. Rationalizing methods of interpretation that treat some myths as traditional accounts based upon historical events are a continuous feature of some modern readings of mythology.

The twentieth century poet and mythographer [[Robert Graves]] offered many such "euhemerist" interpretations in his telling of ''[[The White Goddess]]'' (1948) and ''[[The Greek Myths]]'' (1955). His suggestions that such myths record and justify the political and religious overthrow of earlier cult systems have been widely criticized and are rejected by most scholars.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Juliette|title=The Concept of the Goddess|editor=Sandra Billington, Miranda Green|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=12|chapter=Chapter 1, The Concept of the Goddess|isbn= 9780415197892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=2008-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=320|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="paganism_reader"&gt;''The Paganism Reader''. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=145|isbn= 9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan" /&gt;&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONROLESOF&gt;Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998).

'''Feminist theory''' is the extension of [[feminism]] into theoretical, fictional, or [[Philosophy|philosophical]] discourse. It aims to understand the nature of [[gender inequality]].  It examines women's and men's [[Gender role|social roles]], experiences, interests, chores, and feminist politics in a variety of fields, such as [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]], [[communication]], [[media studies]], [[psychoanalysis]],&lt;ref name="Chodorow1989"&gt;Chodorow, Nancy J., ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=y4Ul15oJ-WcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory]'' (Yale University Press: 1989, 1991)&lt;/ref&gt; [[home economics]], [[Feminist literary criticism|literature]], [[education]], and [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name="Brabeck&amp;Brown"&gt;Brabeck, M. and Brown, L.

== History ==

Feminist theories first emerged as early as 1794 in publications such as ''[[A Vindication of the Rights of Woman]]'' by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], "The Changing Woman",&lt;ref&gt;"The Changing Woman" (Navajo Origin Myth). Feminist Theory: A Reader. 2nd Ed. Edited by Kolmar, Wendy and Bartowski, Frances.  New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Ain't I a Woman?|Ain't I a Woman]]",&lt;ref&gt;Truth, Sojourner. "Ain't I a Woman". Feminist Theory: A Reader. 2nd Ed. Edited by Kolmar, Wendy and Bartowski, Frances.  New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; "Speech after Arrest for Illegal Voting",&lt;ref&gt;Anthony, Susan B. "Speech After Arrest for Illegal Voting". Feminist Theory: A Reader. 2nd Ed. Edited by Kolmar, Wendy and Bartowski, Frances.  New York: McGraw-Hill, 2005. 91-95.&lt;/ref&gt; and so on.  "The Changing Woman" is a [[Navajo people|Navajo]] Myth that gave credit to a woman who, in the end, populated the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/Changing_Woman-Navajo.html|title=Native American Indian Legends - Changing Woman - Navajo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1851, [[Sojourner Truth]] addressed women's rights issues through her publication, "Ain't I a Woman". Sojourner Truth addressed the issue of women having limited rights due to men's flawed perception of women. Truth argued that if a woman of color can perform tasks that were supposedly limited to men, then any woman of any color could perform those same tasks.  After her arrest for illegally voting, [[Susan B. Anthony]] gave a speech within court in which she addressed the issues of language within the constitution documented in her publication, "Speech after Arrest for Illegal voting" in 1872.  Anthony questioned the authoritative principles of the constitution and its male gendered language.  She raised the question of why women are accountable to be punished under law but they cannot use the law for their own protection (women could not vote, own property, nor themselves in marriage).  She also critiqued the constitution for its male gendered language and questioned why women should have to abide by laws that do not specify women.

[[Nancy Cott]] makes a distinction between ''modern feminism'' and its antecedents, particularly the [[Suffragette|struggle for suffrage]]. In the [[United States]] she places the turning point in the decades before and after women obtained the vote in 1920 (1910–1930). She argues that the prior ''woman movement'' was primarily about woman as a ''[[universalism|universal]]'' entity, whereas over this 20-year period it transformed itself into one primarily concerned with [[Differentiation (sociology)|social differentiation]], attentive to ''[[individuality]]'' and diversity. New issues dealt more with woman's condition as a [[social construct]], [[gender identity]], and relationships within and between genders. Politically this represented a shift from an ideological alignment comfortable with the right, to one more radically associated with the left.&lt;ref&gt;Cott, Nancy F. The Grounding of Modern Feminism. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Kingsley Kent says that Freudian patriarchy was responsible for the diminished profile of feminism in the inter-war years,&lt;ref&gt;Kent, Susan Kingsley. Making Peace: The Reconstruction of Gender in Interwar Britain. Princeton, N.J. 1993&lt;/ref&gt; others such as [[Juliet Mitchell]] consider this to be
overly simplistic since [[Freudian theory]] is not wholly incompatible with feminism.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, Juliet. Psychoanalysis and Feminism: Freud, Reich, Laing, and Women. New York 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Some feminist scholarship shifted away from the need to establish the origins of [[family]], and towards analyzing the process of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;Stocking, George W. Jr. After Tylor: British Social Anthropology, 1888–1951. Madison, Wisconsin 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In the immediate postwar period, [[Simone de Beauvoir]] stood in opposition to an image of "the woman in the home". De Beauvoir provided an [[existentialist]] dimension to feminism with the publication of ''Le Deuxième Sexe'' ([[The Second Sex]]) in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/ethics/de-beauvoir/2nd-sex/index.htm|title=Le Deuxième Sexe (online edition)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the title implies, the starting point is the implicit inferiority of women, and the first question de Beauvoir asks is "what is a woman"?.&lt;ref&gt;Moi, Toril. What is a Woman? And Other Essays. Oxford 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
Woman she realizes is always perceived of as the "other", "''she is defined and differentiated with reference to man and not he with reference to her''". In this book and her essay, "''Woman: Myth &amp; Reality''", de Beauvoir anticipates [[Betty Friedan]] in seeking to demythologise the male concept of woman. "''A myth invented by men to confine women to their oppressed state. For women it is not a question of asserting themselves as women, but of becoming full-scale human beings''." "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman", or as [[Toril Moi]] puts it "a woman defines herself through the way she lives her embodied situation in the world, or in other words, through the way in which she makes something of what the world makes of her". Therefore, woman must regain subject, to escape her defined role as "other", as a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Cartesian]] point of departure.&lt;ref&gt;Bergoffen, Debra B. The Philosophy of Simone de Beauvoir: Gendered Phenomenologies, Erotic Generosities. SUNY 1996 {{ISBN|0-7914-3151-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In her examination of myth, she appears as one who does not accept any special privileges for women. Ironically, feminist philosophers have had to extract de Beauvoir herself from out of the shadow of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] to fully appreciate her.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Shannon. The work of Simone de Beauvoir: Introduction Journal of Speculative Philosophy 2000 14(2):v&lt;/ref&gt; While more philosopher and novelist than activist, she did sign one of the ''Mouvement de Libération des Femmes'' manifestos.

The resurgence of feminist activism in the late 1960s was accompanied by an emerging literature of concerns for the earth and spirituality, and [[environmentalism]]. This in turn created an atmosphere conducive to reigniting the study of and debate on matricentricity,
as a rejection of [[Biological determinism|determinism]], such as [[Adrienne Rich]]&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Adrienne. Of Woman Born: Motherhood as Experience and Institution New York 1976&lt;/ref&gt;
and [[Marilyn French]]&lt;ref&gt;French, Marilyn. Beyond Power: On Women, Men, and Morals. New York 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
while for [[socialist feminists]] like [[Evelyn Reed]],&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Evelyn. Woman's Evolution: From Matriarchal Clan to Patriarchal Family. New York, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;
patriarchy held the properties of capitalism. Feminist psychologists, such as [[Jean Baker Miller]], sought to bring a feminist analysis to previous psychological theories, proving that "there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them".&lt;ref name="harvardsquarelibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/cfs/jean_baker_miller.php Jean Baker Miller] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120720194207/http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/cfs/jean_baker_miller.php |date=2012-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elaine Showalter]] describes the development of feminist theory as having a number of phases. The first she calls "feminist critique" – where the feminist reader examines the ideologies behind literary phenomena. The second Showalter calls [[Gynocriticism|"Gynocritics"]] – where the "woman is producer of textual meaning" including "the [[psychodynamics]] of female creativity; [[linguistics]] and the problem of a female language; the trajectory of the individual or collective female literary career and [[literary history]]". The last phase she calls "gender theory" – where the "ideological inscription and the literary effects of the [[sex/gender distinction|sex/gender system]]" are explored".&lt;ref name=showalter1979&gt;Showalter, Elaine. '[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/180283/ Toward a Feminist Poetics: Women's Writing and Writing About Women]' in ''The New Feminist Criticism: Essays on Women, Literature and Theory'' (Random House, 1988), {{ISBN|978-0-394-72647-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model has been criticized by [[Toril Moi]] who sees it as an [[essentialism|essentialist]] and [[determinism|deterministic]] model for female subjectivity. She also criticized it for not taking account of the situation for women outside the west.&lt;ref name=Moi&gt;Moi, Toril, ''Sexual/Textual Politics'' (Routledge, 2002), {{ISBN|978-0-415-28012-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
From the 1970s onwards, psychoanalytical ideas that have been arising in the field of [[French feminism]] have gained a decisive influence on feminist theory. Feminist psychoanalysis deconstructed the phallic hypotheses regarding the Unconscious. [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Luce Irigaray]] developed specific notions concerning unconscious sexual difference, the feminine and motherhood, with wide implications for film and literature analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Zajko, Vanda and Leonard, Miriam (eds.), ''Laughing with Medusa'' (Oxford, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-199-27438-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplines ==

There are a number of distinct feminist disciplines, in which experts in other areas apply feminist techniques and principles to their own fields.  Additionally, these are also debates which shape feminist theory and they can be applied interchangeably in the arguments of feminist theorists.

===Bodies===
In [[Western thought|western thought]], the body has been historically associated solely with women, whereas men have been associated with the mind. [[Susan Bordo]], a modern feminist philosopher, in her writings elaborates the [[Mind-body dualism|dualistic]] nature of the mind/body connection by examining the early philosophies of [[Aristotle]], [[Hegel]] and [[Descartes]], revealing how such distinguishing [[binaries]] such as spirit/matter and male activity/female passivity have worked to solidify gender characteristics and categorization. Bordo goes on to point out that while men have historically been associated with the intellect and the mind or spirit, women have long been associated with the body, the subordinated, negatively imbued term in the mind/body [[dichotomy]].&lt;ref&gt;Bordo, Unbearable Weight, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;
The notion of the body (but not the mind) being associated with women has served as a justification to deem women as property, objects, and exchangeable commodities (among men).  For example, women's bodies have been objectified throughout history through the changing ideologies of fashion, diet, exercise programs, cosmetic surgery, childbearing, etc. This contrasts to men's role as a moral agent, responsible for working or fighting in bloody wars.
The race and class of a woman can determine whether her body will be treated as decoration and protected, which is associated with middle or upper-class women's bodies.  On the other hand, the other body is recognized for its use in labor and exploitation which is generally associated with women's bodies in the working-class or with women of color.
Second-wave feminist activism has argued for reproductive rights and choice, women's health (movement), and lesbian rights (movement) which are also associated with this Bodies debate.

=== The standard and contemporary sex and gender system ===

The standard sex determination and gender model consists of evidence based on the determined sex and gender of every individual and serve as norms for societal life. The model claims that the sex-determination of a person exist within a male/female dichotomy giving importance to genitals and how they are formed via chromosomes, and DNA-binding proteins (such as the sex-determining region Y genes), which are responsible for sending sex-determined initialization and completion signals to and from the biological sex-determination system in fetuses. Occasionally, mutations occur during the sex-determining process. When this happens, the fetus becomes a hermaphrodite. The standard model defines gender as a social understanding/ideology that defines what behaviors, actions, and appearances are normal for males and females. Studies into biological sex-determining systems also have began working towards connecting certain gender conducts such as behaviors, actions, and desires with sex-determinism.&lt;ref&gt;Mittwoch U (October 1988). "The race to be male". ''[[New Scientist]]''. '''120''' (1635): 38–42.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Socially-biasing children sex and gender system'''
{{essay-like|section|date=July 2018}}
The socially-biasing children sex and gender model broadens the horizons of the sex and gender ideologies. It revises the ideology of sex to be a social construct which is not limited to either male or female. The [[Intersex Society of North America]] which explains that, "nature doesn't decide where the category of 'male' ends and the category of '[[intersex]]' begins, or where the category of 'intersex' ends and the category of 'female' begins. Humans decide. Humans (today, typically doctors) decide how small a penis has to be, or how unusual a combination of parts has to be, before it counts as intersex".&lt;ref&gt;ISNA."Frequently Asked Questions." Intersex Society of North America 1993–2008&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, sex is not a biological/natural construct but a social one instead since, society and doctors decide on what it means to be male, female, or intersex in terms of sex chromosomes and genitals, in addition to their personal judgment on who or how one passes as a specific sex. The ideology of gender remains a social construct but is not as strict and fixed. Instead, gender is easily malleable, and is forever changing. One example of where the standard definition of gender alters with time happens to be depicted in [[Sally Shuttleworth]]'s ''Female Circulation'' in which the, "abasement of the woman, reducing her from an active participant in the labor market to the passive bodily existence to be controlled by male expertise is indicative of the ways in which the ideological deployment of gender roles operated to facilitate and sustain the changing structure of familial and market relations in Victorian England".&lt;ref&gt;Shuttleworth, Sally. "Female Circulation: Medical Discourse and Popular Advertising in the Mid-Victorian Era." Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science. Eds. Mary Jacobus, Evelyn Fox Keller and Sally Shuttleworth. New York: Routledge, 1990. 47-70.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, this quote shows what it meant growing up into the roles of a female (gender/roles) changed from being a homemaker to being a working woman and then back to being passive and inferior to males. In conclusion, the contemporary sex gender model is accurate because both sex and gender are rightly seen as social constructs inclusive of the wide spectrum of sexes and genders and in which nature and nurture are interconnected.

===Epistemologies===
The generation and production of knowledge has been an important part of feminist theory and is at the centre of discussions on [[feminist epistemology]].  This debate proposes such questions as "Are there 'women's ways of knowing' and 'women's knowledge'?"  And "How does the knowledge women produce about themselves differ from that produced by patriarchy?"&lt;ref name="Feminist theory : a reader"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bartkowski|first1=[compiled by] Wendy K. Kolmar, Frances|title=Feminist theory : a reader|date=1999|publisher=Mayfield Pub. Co|location=Mountain View, Calif [u. a.]|isbn=978-1559349253|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feminist theorists have also proposed the "feminist standpoint knowledge" which attempts to replace the "[[view from nowhere]]" with the model of knowing that expels the "view from women's lives".&lt;ref name="Feminist theory : a reader"/&gt; A feminist approach to epistemology seeks to establish knowledge production from a woman's perspective. It theorizes that from personal experience comes knowledge which helps each individual look at things from a different insight.

Central to feminism is that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their [[agency (sociology)|agency]] to this subordination, e.g., acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God; Simone de Beauvoir labels such women "mutilated" and "[[immanent]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Look as Bad Faith'', Debra B. Bergoffen, Philosophy Today 36, 3 (1992), 221-227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It argues, with Simone de Beauvoir, that patriarchal marriage is both a perversion of the meaning of the couple and an institution in transition"'', Marriage, Autonomy, and the Feminine Protest'', Hypatia, Volume 14, Number 4, Fall 1999, pp. 18-35, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/hypatia/v014/14.4bergoffen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"mutilated... immanent...''", ''The Second Sex'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]], H.M. Parshley (Trans), Vintage Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"… women are systematically subordinated… de Beauvoir labels women "mutilated" and "immanent"…  women succumb to 'bad faith' and surrender their agency…", Feminist Perspectives on the Self, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intersectionality===
{{Main article|Intersectionality}}
Intersectionality is the examination of various ways in which people are oppressed, based on the relational web of dominating factors of race, sex, class, nation and sexual orientation. Intersectionality "describes the simultaneous, multiple, overlapping, and contradictory systems of power that shape our lives and political options". While this theory can be applied to all people, and more particularly all women, it is specifically mentioned and studied within the realms of black feminism. [[Patricia Hill Collins]] argues that black women in particular, have a unique perspective on the oppression of the world as unlike white women, they face both racial and gender oppression simultaneously, among other factors. This debate raises the issue of understanding the oppressive lives of women that are not only shaped by gender alone but by other elements such as racism, classism, ageism, heterosexism, ableism etc.

===Language===
{{see also|Feminist language reform|Gender-neutral language|Category:Feminist terminology}}
In this debate, women writers have addressed the issues of masculinized writing through male gendered language that may not serve to accommodate the literary understanding of women's lives. Such masculinized language that feminist theorists address is the use of, for example, "God the Father" which is looked upon as a way of designating the sacred as solely men (or, in other words, biblical language glorifies men through all of the masculine pronouns like "he" and "him" and addressing God as a "He").  Feminist theorists attempt to reclaim and redefine women through re-structuring language.  For example, feminist theorists have used the term "[[womyn]]" instead of "women".  Some feminist theorists find solace in changing titles of unisex jobs (for example, police officer versus policeman or mail carrier versus mailman). Some feminist theorists have [[Reappropriation|reclaimed]] and redefined such words as "[[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]" and "[[Bitch (insult)|bitch]]" and others have invested redefining knowledge into feminist dictionaries.

===Psychology===
[[Feminist psychology]] is a form of psychology centered on societal structures and gender. Feminist psychology critiques the fact that historically psychological research has been done from a male perspective with the view that males are the norm.&lt;ref name="Crawford, M. 2000"&gt;Crawford, M. &amp; Unger, R. (2000). Women and Gender: A feminist psychology (3rd ed.). Boston, MA: McGraw-Hill Companies Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist psychology is oriented on the values and principles of feminism. It incorporates gender and the ways women are affected by issues resulting from it. [[Ethel Dench Puffer Howes]] was one of the first women to enter the field of psychology. She was the Executive Secretary of the [[National College Equal Suffrage League]] in 1914.

One major psychological theory, ''[[Relational-cultural therapy|relational-cultural theory]]'', is based on the work of [[Jean Baker Miller]], whose book ''Toward a New Psychology of Women'' proposes that "growth-fostering relationships are a central human necessity and that disconnections are the source of psychological problems".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/changingthefaceofmedicine/physicians/biography_225.html|title=Biography of Dr. Jean Baker Miller|work=Changing the Face of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by Betty Friedan's ''[[The Feminine Mystique|Feminine Mystique]]'', and other feminist classics from the 1960s, relational-cultural theory proposes that "isolation is one of the most damaging human experiences and is best treated by reconnecting with other people", and that a therapist should "foster an atmosphere of empathy and acceptance for the patient, even at the cost of the therapist's neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/08/us/08miller.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | first=Jeremy | last=Pearce | title=Jean Baker Miller, 78, Psychiatrist, Is Dead | date=8 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory is based on clinical observations and sought to prove that "there was nothing wrong with women, but rather with the way modern culture viewed them".&lt;ref name="harvardsquarelibrary.org"/&gt;

====Psychoanalysis====
{{see also|Psychoanalysis|Feminism and the Oedipus complex}}
Psychoanalytic feminism and [[Psychoanalysis|feminist psychoanalysis]] are based on [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] and his [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic theories]], but they also supply an important critique of it. It maintains that [[gender]] is not biological but is based on the psycho-sexual development of the individual, but also that sexual difference and gender are different notions. Psychoanalytical feminists believe that [[gender inequality]] comes from early childhood experiences, which lead men to believe themselves to be [[Masculinity|masculine]], and women to believe themselves [[Femininity|feminine]]. It is further maintained that gender leads to a [[social structure|social system]] that is dominated by males, which in turn influences the individual psycho-sexual development. As a solution it was suggested by some to avoid the gender-specific structuring of the society [[coeducation]].&lt;ref name=Chodorow1989/&gt;&lt;ref name= Lerman1990/&gt; From the last 30 years of the 20th century, the contemporary French psychoanalytical theories concerning the feminine, that refer to sexual difference rather than to gender, with psychoanalysts like [[Julia Kristeva]],&lt;ref&gt;Kristeva, Julia, Toril Moi (Ed.), 'The Kristeva Reader'.

===Literary theory===
{{main article|Feminist literary criticism}}
{{see also|Gynocriticism}}
Feminist literary criticism is [[literary criticism]] informed by feminist theories or politics. Its history has been varied, from classic works of female authors such as [[George Eliot]], [[Virginia Woolf]],&lt;ref&gt;Humm, Maggie, ''Modernist Women and Visual Cultures''. Rutgers University Press, 2003. {{ISBN|0-8135-3266-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Margaret Fuller]] to recent theoretical work in [[women's studies]] and [[gender studies]] by "[[third-wave feminism|third-wave]]" authors.&lt;ref name=Barry&gt;Barry, Peter, 'Feminist Literary Criticism' in ''Beginning theory'' (Manchester University Press: 2002), {{ISBN|0-7190-6268-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the most general, feminist literary criticism before the 1970s was concerned with the politics of women's authorship and the representation of women's condition within literature.&lt;ref name=Barry/&gt; Since the arrival of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity, feminist literary criticism has taken a variety of new routes. It has considered gender in the terms of [[Sigmund Freud|Freudian]] and [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]] [[psychoanalysis]], as part of the [[deconstruction]] of existing power relations.&lt;ref name=Barry/&gt;

=== Film theory ===
{{main article|Feminist film theory}}
Many feminist film critics, such as [[Laura Mulvey]], have pointed to the "[[male gaze]]" that predominates in classical Hollywood film making. Through the use of various [[film technique]]s, such as [[shot reverse shot]], the viewers are led to align themselves with the point of view of a male protagonist. Notably, women function as objects of this gaze far more often than as proxies for the spectator.&lt;ref name=Chaudhuri&gt;Chaudhuri, Shohini, ''Feminist Film Theorists'' (Routledge, 2006) {{ISBN|978-0-415-32433-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mulvey&gt;Mulvey, Laura 'Visual Pleasure and Narrative Cinema' in ''Feminism and Film Theory''.

===History===
{{main article|Feminist history}}
Feminist history refers to the re-reading and re-interpretation of history from a feminist [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]]. It is not the same as the [[history of feminism]], which outlines the origins and evolution of the [[feminist movement]]. It also differs from [[women's history]], which focuses on the role of women in historical events. The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and choices in the past.&lt;ref name=Cain1994&gt;Cain, William E., ed.

===Geography===
{{main article|Feminist geography}}
Feminist geography is often considered part of a broader [[postmodern]] approach to the subject which is not primarily concerned with the development of conceptual theory in itself but rather focuses on the real experiences of individuals and groups in their own localities, upon the geographies that they live in within their own communities. In addition to its analysis of the real world, it also critiques existing geographical and [[social studies]], arguing that academic traditions are delineated by [[patriarchy]], and that contemporary studies which do not confront the nature of previous work reinforce the male bias of academic study.&lt;ref name=rose&gt;Rose, Gillian, ''[https://www.jstor.org/stable/216079 Feminism and Geography: The Limits of Geographical Knowledge]'' (Univ. of Minnesota Press, 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moss&gt;Moss, Pamela, ''Feminisms in Geography: Rethinking Space, Place, and Knowledges'' (Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, 2007) {{ISBN|978-0-7425-3829-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Welchman, John C., Rethinking Borders. Macmillan, 1996 {{ISBN|0-333-56580-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philosophy===
{{main article|Feminist philosophy}}
The Feminist philosophy refers to a philosophy approached from a feminist perspective. Feminist philosophy involves attempts to use methods of philosophy to further the cause of the feminist movements, it also tries to criticize and/or reevaluate the ideas of traditional philosophy from within a feminist view. This critique stems from the [[dichotomy]] [[Western philosophy]] has conjectured with the [[mind and body]] phenomena.&lt;ref name=Gender&gt;{{cite book|last=Rée|first=Jonathan|title=The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0-203-64177-4|pages=143–145|edition=3rd|author2=Urmson, J.O.}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no specific school for feminist philosophy like there has been in regard to other theories.  This means that Feminist philosophers can be found in the analytic and continental traditions, and the different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues with those traditions.  Feminist philosophers also have many different viewpoints taken on philosophical issues within those traditions. Feminist philosophers who are feminists can belong to many different varieties of feminism. The writings of [[Judith Butler]], [[Rosi Braidotti]], [[Donna Haraway]], [[Bracha Ettinger]] and [[Avital Ronell]] are the most significant psychoanalytically informed influences on contemporary feminist philosophy.

===Sexology===
{{main article|Feminist sexology}}
Feminist sexology is an offshoot of traditional studies of [[sexology]] that focuses on the [[intersectionality]] of sex and gender in relation to the sexual lives of women. Feminist sexology shares many principles with the wider field of sexology; in particular, it does not try to prescribe a certain path or "normality" for women's sexuality, but only observe and note the different and varied ways in which women express their sexuality. Looking at sexuality from a feminist point of view creates connections between the different aspects of a person's sexual life.

From feminists' perspectives, sexology, which is the study of human sexuality and sexual relationship, relates to the intersectionality of gender, race and sexuality. Men have dominant power and control over women in the relationship, and women are expected to hide their true feeling about sexual behaviors. Women of color face even more sexual violence in the society. Some countries in Africa and Asia even practice female genital cutting, controlling women's sexual desire and limiting their sexual behavior. Moreover, Bunch, the women's and human rights activist, states that the society used to see lesbianism as a threat to male supremacy and to the political relationships between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Charlotte. ''Lesbians in Revolt''. 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the past, people viewed being a lesbian as a sin and made it death penalty. Even today, many people still discriminate homosexuals. Many lesbians hide their sexuality and face even more sexual oppression.

===Monosexual paradigm===
{{main article|Monosexuality}}
Monosexual Paradigm is a term coined by Blasingame, a self-identified African American, bisexual female. Blasingame used this term to address the lesbian and gay communities who turned a blind eye to the dichotomy that oppressed bisexuals from both heterosexual and homosexual communities. This oppression negatively affects the gay and lesbian communities more so than the heterosexual community due to its contradictory exclusiveness of bisexuals. 
Blasingame argued that in reality dichotomies are inaccurate to the representation of individuals because nothing is truly black or white, straight or gay. Her main argument is that biphobia is the central message of two roots; internalized heterosexism and racism. Internalized heterosexism is described in the monosexual paradigm in which the binary states that you are either straight or gay and nothing in between. Gays and lesbians accept this internalized heterosexism by morphing into the monosexial paradigm and favoring single attraction and opposing attraction for both sexes. Blasingame described this favoritism as an act of horizontal hostility, where oppressed groups fight amongst themselves. Racism is described in the monosexual paradigm as a dichotomy where individuals are either black or white, again nothing in between. The issue of racism comes into fruition in regards to the bisexuals coming out process, where risks of coming out vary on a basis of anticipated community reaction and also in regards to the norms among bisexual leadership, where class status and race factor predominately over sexual orientation.

===Politics===
{{main article|Feminist political theory}}
Feminist political theory is a recently emerging field in [[political science]] focusing on gender and feminist themes within the state, institutions and policies. It questions the "modern political theory, dominated by universalistic liberalist thought, which claims indifference to gender or other identity differences and has therefore taken its time to open up to such concerns".&lt;ref name="fpt"&gt;Véronique Mottier, ''[http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/publications/eps/onlineissues/spring2004/research/mottier.htm Feminist analyses of the state] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070827202958/http://www.essex.ac.uk/ecpr/publications/eps/onlineissues/spring2004/research/mottier.htm |date=2007-08-27 }}'', Feminist political theory, [[University of Essex]]. Retrieved on 1-10-2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist perspectives entered [[international relations]] in late 1980s, at about the same time as the end of the [[Cold War]]. This time was not a coincidence because the last forty years the conflict between [[US]] and [[USSR]] had been the dominant agenda of international politics. After the Cold War, there was continuing relative peace between the main powers. Soon, many new issues appeared on international relation's agenda. More attention was also paid to social movements. Indeed, in those times feminist approaches also used to depict the world politics. Feminists started to emphasize that while women have always been players in international system, their participation has frequently been associated with in non-governmental settings such as social movements. However, they could also participate in inter-state decision making process as men did. In fact, today, women also participate in iternational politics as the wives of diplomats, nannies who go abroad to find work and support their family, or sex workers trafficked across international boundaries. Women's contributions has not been seen in the areas where hard power plays significant role such as military. In contrast, women are profoundly impacted by decisions the statepersons make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editors=John Baylis, Patricia Owens and Steve Smith|title=The Globalization of World Politics|last=|first=|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|location=|pages=267}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics ===
{{main article|Feminist economics}}
Feminist economics broadly refers to a developing branch of [[economics]] that applies feminist insights and critiques to economics. Research under this heading is often interdisciplinary, critical, or [[heterodox]]. It encompasses debates about the relationship between feminism and economics on many levels: from applying mainstream economic methods to under-researched "women's" areas, to questioning how [[mainstream economics]] values the reproductive sector, to deeply philosophical critiques of economic [[epistemology]] and methodology.&lt;ref&gt;Barker, Drucilla K. and Edith Kuiper, eds. 2003.

Marianne A. Ferber and Julie A. Nelson, ''Feminist Economics Today: Beyond Economic Man'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''Houseworker's Handbook'' Betsy Warrior presents a cogent argument that the reproduction and domestic labor of women form the foundation of economic survival; although, unremunerated and not included in the GDP.&lt;ref name="ncdsv.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdsv.org/images/BH_Modest-Herstory-of-Besty-Warrior_8-2013.pdf|title="A Modest Herstory" of Betsy Warrior }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Warrior: "Economics, as it's presented today, lacks any basis in reality as it leaves out the very foundation of economic life. That foundation is built on women's labor; first her reproductive labor which produces every new laborer (and the first commodity, which is mother's milk and which nurtures every new "consumer/laborer"); secondly, women's labor composed of cleaning, cooking, negotiating social stability and nurturing, which prepares for market and maintains each laborer. This constitutes women's continuing industry enabling laborers to occupy every position in the work force. Without this fundamental labor and commodity there would be no economic activity." Warrior also notes that the unacknowledged income of men from illegal activities like arms, drugs and human trafficking, political graft, religious emoluments and various other undisclosed activities provide a rich revenue stream to men, which further invalidates GDP figures.&lt;ref name="ncdsv.org"/&gt; Even in underground economies where women predominate numerically, like trafficking in humans, prostitution and domestic servitude, only a tiny fraction of the pimp's revenue filters down to the women and children he deploys. Usually the amount spent on them is merely for the maintenance of their lives and, in the case of those prostituted, some money may be spent on clothing and such accouterments as will make them more salable to the pimp's clients. For instance, focusing on just the U.S., according to a government sponsored report by the Urban Institute in 2014, "A street prostitute in Dallas may make as little as $5 per sex act. But pimps can take in $33,000 a week in Atlanta, where the sex business brings in an estimated $290 million per year."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/12/us/in-depth-report-details-economics-of-sex-trade.html|title=In-Depth Report Details Economics of Sex Trade|first=Annie|last=Lowrey|date=12 March 2014|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of this theory have been instrumental in creating alternative models, such as the [[capability approach]] and incorporating gender into the analysis of economic data to affect policy. Marilyn Power suggests that feminist economic methodology can be broken down into five categories.&lt;ref&gt;Power, Marilyn. "Social Provisioning as a Starting Point for Feminist Economics" ''Feminist Economics''. Volume 10, Number 3. Routledge, November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal theory===
{{main article|Feminist legal theory}}
Feminist legal theory is based on the feminist view that law's treatment of women in relation to men has not been equal or fair. The goals of feminist legal theory, as defined by leading theorist Claire Dalton, consist of understanding and exploring the female experience, figuring out if law and institutions oppose females, and figuring out what changes can be committed to. This is to be accomplished through studying the connections between the law and gender as well as applying feminist analysis to concrete areas of law.&lt;ref name=Dalton1&gt;Dalton, Claire, 'Where We Stand: Observations on the Situation of Feminist Legal Thought' in ''Feminist Legal Theory: Foundations'' ed. by D. Kelly Weisberg (Temple University Press, 1993), {{ISBN|978-1-56639-028-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalton2&gt;Dalton, Claire, 'Deconstructing Contract Doctrine' in ''Feminist Legal Theory: Readings in Law and Gender'' ed. by
Katharine T. Bartlett and Rosanne Kennedy (Harper Collins, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bartlett1992&gt;''Feminist Legal Theory: Readings in Law and Gender'' ed. by Katharine T. Bartlett and Rosanne Kennedy (Harper Collins, 1992), {{ISBN|978-0-8133-1248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist legal theory stems from the inadequacy of the current structure to account for discrimination women face, especially discrimination based on multiple, intersecting identities. Kimberlé Crenshaw's work is central to feminist legal theory, particularly her article ''Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics''. ''DeGraffenreid v General Motors'' is an example of such a case. In this instance, the court ruled the plaintiffs, five Black women who were employees of General Motors, were not eligible to file a complaint on the grounds they, as black women, were not "a special class to be protected from discrimination".&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crenshaw|first1=Kimberlé|title=Demarginalizing the Intersection of Race and Sex: A Black Feminist Critique of Antidiscrimination Doctrine, Feminist Theory, and Antiracist Politics|date=1991|publisher=Westview Press, Inc.|isbn=978-0-8133-1247-7|pages=57–80|url=http://politicalscience.tamu.edu/documents/faculty/Crenshaw-Demarginalizing.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150206030330/http://politicalscience.tamu.edu/documents/faculty/Crenshaw-Demarginalizing.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ruling in ''DeGraffenreid'' against the plaintiff revealed the courts inability to understand intersectionality's role in discrimination.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; ''Moore v Hughes Helicopters, Inc.'' is another ruling, which serves to reify the persistent discrediting of intersectionality as a factor in discrimination. In the case of ''Moore'', the plaintiff brought forth statistical evidence revealing a disparity in promotions to upper-level and supervisory jobs between men and women and, to a lesser extent, between Black and white men.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; Ultimately, the court denied the plaintiff the ability to represent all Blacks and all females.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; The decision dwindled the pool of statistical information the plaintiff could pull from and limited the evidence only to that of Black women, which is a ruling in direct contradiction to ''DeGraffenreid''.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; Further, because the plaintiff originally claimed discrimination as a Black female rather than, more generally, as a female the court stated it had concerns whether the plaintiff could "adequately represent white female employees".&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; ''Payne v Travenol'' serves as yet another example of the courts inconsistency when dealing with issues revolving around intersections of race and sex. The plaintiffs in ''Payne'', two Black females, filed suit against Travenol on behalf of both Black men and women on the grounds the pharmaceutical plant practiced racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; The court ruled the plaintiffs could not adequately represent Black males, however, they did allow the admittance of statistical evidence, which was inclusive of all Black employees.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; Despite the more favorable outcome after it was found there was extensive racial discrimination, the courts decided the benefits of the ruling – back pay and constructive seniority – would not be extended to Black males employed by the company.&lt;ref name="Westview Press, Inc"/&gt; ''Moore'' contends Black women cannot adequately represent white women on issues of sex discrimination, ''Payne'' suggests Black women cannot adequately represent Black men on issues of race discrimination, and ''DeGraffenreid'' argues Black women are not a special class to be protected. The rulings, when connected, display a deep-rooted problem in regards to addressing discrimination within the legal system. While the cases of ''DeGraffenreid'' (1976), ''Moore'' (1983), and ''Payne'' (1976) are not recent accounts; they provide proof of the courts inconsistency in procedures and rulings on the basis of sex and race, which serves to reinforce the need for Feminist legal theory to not only be further developed, but also applied.

===Communication theory===
Feminist communication theory has evolved over time and branches out in many directions.  Early theories focused on the way that gender influenced communication and many argued that language was "man made". This view of communication promoted a "[[Information deficit model|deficiency model]]" asserting that characteristics of speech associated with women were negative and that men "set the standard for competent interpersonal communication", which influences the type of language used by men and women. These early theories also suggested that ethnicity, cultural and economic backgrounds also needed to be addressed. They looked at how gender intersects with other identity constructs, such as class, race, and sexuality.   Feminist theorists, especially those considered to be liberal feminists, began looking at issues of equality in education and employment.  Other theorists addressed political oratory and public discourse.  The recovery project brought to light many women orators who had been "erased or ignored as significant contributors".  Feminist communication theorists also addressed how women were represented in the media and how the media "communicated ideology about women, gender, and feminism".&lt;ref&gt;Dow, B. (2009). Feminist approaches to communication. In W. Eadie (Ed.), 21st century communication: A reference handbook. (pp. 82-90). Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Griffin |first=C. |title=Feminist Communication Theories |editor-last1=Littlejohn |editor-first1=Stephen W. |editor-last2=Foss |editor-first2=Karen A. |work=Encyclopedia of Communication Theory |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S8Kf0N0XALIC&amp;pg=PA391 |year=2009 |publisher=SAGE Publications |isbn=978-1-4129-5937-7 |pages=391–392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist communication theory also encompasses access to the public sphere, whose voices are heard in that sphere, and the ways in which the field of communication studies has limited what is regarded as essential to public discourse. The recognition of a full history of women orators overlooked and disregarded by the field has effectively become an undertaking of recovery, as it establishes and honors the existence of women in history and lauds the communication by these historically significant contributors. This recovery effort, begun by [[Andrea Lunsford]], Professor of [[English studies|English]] and Director of the Program in Writing and Rhetoric at [[Stanford University]] and followed by other feminist communication theorists also names women such as [[Aspasia]], [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], and [[Christine de Pisan]], who were likely influential in rhetorical and communication traditions in classical and medieval times, but who have been negated as serious contributors to the traditions.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395"/&gt;

Feminist communication theorists are also concerned with a recovery effort in attempting to explain the methods used by those with power to prohibit women like [[Maria W. Stewart]], [[Sarah Moore Grimké]], and [[Angelina Grimké]], and more recently, [[Ella Baker]] and [[Anita Hill]], from achieving a voice in political discourse and consequently being driven from the public sphere. Theorists in this vein are also interested in the unique and significant techniques of communication employed by these women and others like them to surmount some of the oppression they experienced.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395"/&gt;

Feminist theorist also evaluate communication expectations for students and women in the work place, in particular how the performance of feminine versus masculine styles of communicating are constructed. [[Judith Butler]], who coined the term "[[Social construction of gender|gender performativity]]" further suggests that, "theories of communication must explain the ways individuals negotiate, resist, and transcend their identities in a highly gendered society". This focus also includes the ways women are constrained or "disciplined" in the discipline of communication in itself, in terms of biases in research styles and the "silencing" of feminist scholarship and theory.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395" /&gt;

Who is responsible for deciding what is considered important public discourse is also put into question by feminist theorists in communication scholarship. This lens of feminist communication theory is labeled as [[revalorist theory]] which honors the historical perspective of women in communication in an attempt to recover voices that have been historically neglected.&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395" /&gt; There have been many attempts to explain the lack of representative voices in the public sphere for women including, the notion that, "the public sphere is built on [[Essentialism|essentialist]] principles that prevent women from being seen as legitimate communicators in that sphere", and [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|theories of subalternity]]", which, "under extreme conditions of oppression...prevent those in positions of power from even hearing their communicative attempts".&lt;ref name="Griffin, C. 2009 pp. 391-395" /&gt;

===Design===
Technical writers{{who|date=July 2018}} have concluded that visual language can convey facts and ideas clearer than almost any other means of communication.&lt;ref name="Bosley"&gt;Bosley, Deborah. Gender and Visual Communication: Toward a Feminist Theory of Design. IEEE Transactions on Professional Communication, Vol. 35, No. 4, December 1992, pp. 222-228&lt;/ref&gt; According to the feminist theory, "gender may be a factor in how human beings represent reality."&lt;ref name="Bosley" /&gt;

Men and women will construct different types of structures about the self, and, consequently, their thought processes may diverge in content and form. This division depends on the self-concept, which is an "important regulator of thoughts, feelings and actions" that "governs one's perception of reality".&lt;ref&gt;Markus, Hazel, Oyserman, Daphna. Gender and Thought: The Role of Self Concept. Gender and Thought: Psychological Perspectives, 1989, pp. 100-127&lt;/ref&gt;

With that being said, the self-concept has a significant effect on how men and women represent reality in different ways.

Recently, "technical communicators'{{who|date=July 2018}} terms such as 'visual rhetoric,' 'visual language,' and 'document design' indicate a new awareness of the importance of visual design".&lt;ref name="Bosley" /&gt;

Deborah S. Bosley explores this new concept of the "feminist theory of design"&lt;ref name="Bosley" /&gt; by conducting a study on a collection of undergraduate males and females who were asked to illustrate a visual, on paper, given to them in a text. Based on this study, she creates a "feminist theory of design" and connects it to technical communicators.

In the results of the study, males used more angular illustrations, such as squares, rectangles and arrows, which are interpreted as a "direction" moving away from or a moving toward, thus suggesting more aggressive positions than rounded shapes, showing masculinity.

Females, on the other hand, used more curved visuals, such as circles, rounded containers and bending pipes. Bosley takes into account that feminist theory offers insight into the relationship between females and circles or rounded objects. According to Bosley, studies of women and leadership indicate a preference for nonhierarchical work patterns (preferring a communication "web" rather than a communication "ladder"). Bosley explains that circles and other rounded shapes, which women chose to draw, are nonhierarchical and often used to represent inclusive, communal relationships, confirming her results that women's visual designs do have an effect on their means of communications.{{undue inline|reason=pseudoscience|date=July 2018}}

Based on these conclusions, this "feminist theory of design" can go on to say that gender does play a role in how humans represent reality.

===Black feminist criminology===
{{fringe|section|date=July 2018}}
Black feminist criminology theory  is a concept created by Hillary Potter in the 1990s and a bridge that integrates Feminist theory with criminology. It is based on the integration of Black feminist theory and [[critical race theory]].

For years, Black women were historically overlooked and disregarded in the study of crime and criminology; however, with a new focus on Black feminism that sparked in the 1980s, Black feminists began to contextualize their unique experiences and examine why the general status of Black women in the criminal justice system was lacking in female specific approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gabbidon|first=Shaun L.|authorlink=Shaun L. Gabbidon|title=Criminological Perspectives on Race and Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mCGMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA202|year=2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-16049-4|page=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potter explains that because Black women usually have "limited access to adequate education and employment as consequences of racism, sexism, and classism", they are often disadvantaged. This disadvantage materializes into "poor responses by social service professionals and crime-processing agents to Black women's interpersonal victimization".{{sfnp|Gabbidon|2010|page=224}} Most crime studies focused on White males/females and Black males. Any results or conclusions targeted to Black males were usually assumed to be the same situation for Black females. This was very problematic since Black males and Black females differ in what they experience. For instance, economic deprivation, status equality between the sexes, distinctive socialization patterns, racism, and sexism should all be taken into account between Black males and Black females. The two will experience all of these factors differently; therefore, it was crucial to resolve this dilemma.

Black feminist criminology is the solution to this problem. It takes four factors into account: One, it observes the social structural oppression of Black women. Two, it recognizes the Black community and its culture. Three, it looks at Black intimate and familial relations. And four, it looks at the Black woman as an individual. These four factors will help distinguish Black women from Black males into an accurate branch of learning in the criminal justice system.

====Criticisms====

It has been said{{by whom|date=June 2017}} that Black feminist criminology is still in its "infancy stage"; therefore, there is little discussion or studies that disprove it as an effective feminist perspective. In addition to its age, Black feminist criminology has not actively accounted for the role of religion and spirituality in Black women's "experience with abuse".{{sfnp|Gabbidon|2010|pages=224–225}}

===Feminist science and technology studies===
{{main article|Feminist technoscience}}
Feminist science and technology studies (STS) refers to the transdisciplinary field of research on the ways gender and other markers of identity intersect with technology, science, and culture.  The practice emerged from feminist critique on the masculine-coded uses of technology in the fields of natural, medical, and technical sciences, and its entanglement in gender and identity.&lt;ref name="Aberg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Åsberg|first1=Cecilia|last2=Lykke|first2=Nina|title=Feminist technoscience studies|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|date=5 November 2010|volume=17|issue=4|pages=299–305|doi=10.1177/1350506810377692}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of feminist technoscience theory explains science and technologies to be linked and should be held accountable for the social and cultural developments resulting from both fields.&lt;ref name="Aberg"/&gt;

Some key issues feminist technoscience studies address include:

# The use of feminist analysis when applied to scientific ideas and practices.
# Intersections between race, class, gender, science, and technology.
# The implications of situated knowledges.
#Politics of gender on how to understand agency, body, rationality, and the boundaries between nature and culture.&lt;ref name="Aberg"/&gt;

[[Gender]] has been an important theme explored in [[speculative fiction]]. The genres that make up speculative fiction (SF){{Ref label|Note1|a|a}}, [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], [[supernatural fiction]] [[horror fiction|horror]], [[superhero fiction]], [[science fantasy]] and related genres (utopian/dystopian literature), have always offered the opportunity for writers to explore social conventions, including gender, [[gender roles]], and beliefs about gender.  Like all literary forms, the science fiction genre reflects the popular perceptions of the eras in which individual creators were writing; and those creators' responses to gender stereotypes and gender roles.

Many writers have chosen to write with little or no questioning of gender roles, instead effectively reflecting their own cultural gender roles onto their fictional world.  However, many other writers have chosen to use science fiction and non-realistic formats in order to explore cultural conventions, particularly gender roles.  This article discusses works that have explored or expanded the treatment of gender in science fiction.

In addition to the traditional human genders, science fiction has extended the idea of gender to include transgender humans and hypothetical alien species and robots, and imagined trans-real genders, such as with aliens that are truly hermaphroditic or have a "third" gender, or robots that can change gender at will or are without gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Ferrando | first = Francesca | year = 2015 | chapter = Of Posthuman Born: Gender, Utopia and the Posthuman | editor-last1 = Hauskeller | editor-first1 = M. | editor-last2 = Carbonell | editor-first2 = C. | editor-last3 = Philbeck | editor-first3 = T. | title =  Handbook on Posthumanism in Film and Television | location = London | publisher = Palgrave MacMillan | isbn = 978-1-137-43032-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical analysis==
Science fiction has been described as a useful tool for examining society attitudes to and conceptions of gender;&lt;ref name=DGinSF1&gt;Attebery, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; this is particularly true of literature, more so than for other media.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4/&gt; The conventions of speculative fiction genres encourage writers to explore the subject of biological sex and present alternative models for societies and characters with different beliefs about gender.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4&gt;Attebery, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Extrapolation of an initial speculative premise can as easily start from an idea about marriage customs or chromosomes as a technological change.&lt;ref name=DGinSF4/&gt; In spite of this potential, SF has been said to present only ideas about sex and gender that are fashionable or controversial in the present day, which it then projects into a future or fantasy setting.&lt;ref name=spreadmisand108/&gt;

Science fiction in particular has traditionally been a puritanical genre orientated toward a male readership,&lt;ref name=EoSF1088&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', "Sex" p. 1088, 2nd Ed., (1999), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been described as being by men for men, or sometimes for boys.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Nicholls, Peter]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]]'', [[Lisa Tuttle]], "Women as portrayed in Science Fiction" p. 1343, 2nd Ed., (1999), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-897-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the stereotypical tropes of science fiction, such as [[Extraterrestrial life|aliens]], [[robots]] or [[Superpower (ability)|superpowers]] can be employed in such a way as to be metaphors for gender.&lt;ref name=DGinSF5&gt;Attebery, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fantasy has been perceived as more accepting of women compared to science fiction or horror (and offering more roles than historical fiction or romance), yet seldom attempts to question or subvert the bias toward male superiority.&lt;ref name=EoF393&gt;[[John Clute|Clute, John]] &amp; [[John Grant (author)|John Grant]],''[[The Encyclopedia of Fantasy]]'', "Gender" p. 393, 1st Ed., (1997), Orbit, Great Britain, {{ISBN|1-85723-368-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction's tendency to look to the future and imagine different societies gives it the potential to examine gender roles and preconceptions, whereas the use of archetypes and quasi-historical settings in fantasy has often included patriarchy.&lt;ref name=EoF393/&gt;

===Portrayal of women===
{{See also|Women in speculative fiction}}
[[File:Paolo Uccello 050.jpg|thumb|''The Princess and the Dragon'', [[Paolo Uccello]], c. 1470, a classic image of a damsel in distress.]]
The portrayal of women, or female-identified characters in the speculative genres, has varied widely throughout the genres' history. Some writers and artists have challenged their society's gender norms in producing their work; others have not. Among those who have challenged conventional understandings and portrayals of gender and sexuality, there have been of course significant variations. The common perception of the role of female-identified characters in SF works has long been dominated by one of two stereotypes: a woman who is evil ([[villainess]]) or one who is helpless ([[damsel in distress]]). These characters are usually physically attractive and provocatively dressed, often in [[Gender representation in video games#Women in scanty armor|scanty armor]],&lt;ref name="Adweek 4 June 2013"&gt;{{cite news|last=Griner|first=David|title=Will the Fantasy Genre Ever Grow Up and Ditch the Chainmail Bikini?

Viewers are seeing [[femininity]] in a new light as more female-identified Authors and fans come into the speculative fiction world. There have been female-identified characters in forms of strong woman warriors, or even as a main character who can think for herself.&lt;ref&gt;Hatcher, Melissa McCrory. “Finding Woman&amp;Apos;s Role in The Lord of the Rings.” Mythlore: A Journal of J. R. R. Tolkien, C. S. Lewis, Charles Williams, and Mythopoeic Literature, vol. 25, no. 3-4, 2007, pp. 43–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of these gender rules being broken can be seen in many texts such as “[[The Lord of the Rings]]” by [[J.R.R. Tolkien]] and even “[[The Man in the High Castle]]” by [[Philip K. Dick]]. As more and more readers and fans of science fiction become female identified, the portrayal of female characters changes just as speculative fiction changes.&lt;ref&gt;Bainbridge, William. “Women in Science Fiction.” Sex Roles, vol. 8, no. 10, 1982, pp. 1081–1093.&lt;/ref&gt;


The first critical work focusing on women in SF was  ''Symposium: Women in Science Fiction''  (1975), edited by Jeffrey D. Smith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Symposium: Women in Science Fiction|last= Smith|first= Jeffrey D.|authorlink= |year= 1975|publisher= Fantasmicon Press|location= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other influential works include ''Future Females:A Critical Anthology'' (1981) edited by [[Marleen S.

===Robots and cyborgs and the portrayal of women===
{{Main article|Android (robot)|Gynoid}}
A gynoid is a [[robot]] designed to look like a human female, as compared to an [[android (robot)|android]] modeled after a male (or genderless) human. Gynoids are "irresistibly linked" to men's lust, and are mainly designed as sex-objects, having no use beyond "pleasing men's violent sexual desires".&lt;ref&gt;Melzer, Patricia  ''Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought'', p.204 University of Texas Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-292-71307-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A long tradition exists in fiction of men attempting to create the stereotypical "perfect woman".&lt;ref name="melzer202"&gt;Melzer, Patricia  ''Alien Constructions: Science Fiction and Feminist Thought'', p. 202 University of Texas Press, 2006, {{ISBN|978-0-292-71307-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the [[Greek myth]] of [[Pygmalion (mythology)|Pygmalion]], and the female robot Maria in [[Fritz Lang]]'s [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]. Female cyborgs have been similarly used in fiction, in which natural bodies are modified to become objects of fantasy.&lt;ref name="melzer202" /&gt; Fiction about gynoids or female cyborgs reinforce "essentialist ideas of feminity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SciFi in the mind's eye: reading science through science fiction|last=Grebowicz|first=Margret|author2=L.

===Portrayal of men===
Many male protagonists of science fiction are reflections of a single heroic archetype, often having scientific vocations or interests, and being  "cool, rational, competent", "remarkably sexless", interchangeable, and bland.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Annette (1990). ''Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema''. Verso.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annkuhn107&gt;Kuhn, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; [[Annette Kuhn]] posits that these asexual characters are attempts to gain independence from women and mother figures, and that this and their unfailing mechanical prowess is what gives them fans.&lt;ref name=annkuhn108&gt;Kuhn, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; The "super-male" and [[boy genius]] are also common stereotypes  frequently embodied by male characters.&lt;ref name=annkuhn25&gt;Kuhn, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=annkuhn28&gt;Kuhn, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics argue that much of science fiction fetishizes masculinity, and that incorporation of technology into science fiction provides a metaphor for imagined futuristic masculinity. Examples are the use of "hypermasculine cyborgs and console-cowboys". Such technologies are desirable as they reaffirm the readers' masculinity and protect against feminisation.&lt;ref name=SSF27p234&gt;The Fetishization of Masculinity in Science Fiction: The Cyborg and the Console Cowboy, Amanda Fernbach, ''Science Fiction Studies'', Vol. 27, No. 2 (Jul., 2000), p. 234&lt;/ref&gt; This fetishisation of masculinity via technology in science fiction differs from typical fetishisation in other genres, in which the fetishised object is always feminine.&lt;ref name=SSF27p234/&gt;

The book ''Spreading Misandry'' argues that science fiction is often used to make unfounded political claims about gender, and attempt to blame men for all of society's ills.&lt;ref name=spreadmisand108&gt;{{cite book |title= Spreading Misandry: The Teaching of Contempt for Men in Popular Culture|last= Nathanson|first= Paul |authorlink= |author2=Katherine K.

=== Portrayal of transgender humans ===
{{Original research section|date=December 2017}}

While the ability to shift gender is common in Speculative and Science fiction, there is very little representation of trans identified human characters that are used as little more than a plot device for the author.  Male authors use the ability to change gender either speculate about medical technology or to act out an ideal of femininity.  Female authors use shifting gender to discuss the condition of being woman identified.  Both create trans-identified characters as caricatures of women, rather than full humans.  This is beginning to shift as more trans and queer identified authors are writing within the Sci-Fi/Speculative Fiction/Fantasy genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cheryl-morgan.com/?page_id=9294|title=Changing Images of Trans People in Science Fiction and Fantasy Literature|date=2010-08-16|work=Cheryl's Mewsings|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published source|date=December 2017}}

===Single-gender worlds: utopias and dystopias===
{{Main article|Single-gender worlds}}
{{See also|Utopian and dystopian fiction}}
Single-gender worlds or single-sex societies have long been one of the primary ways to explore implications of gender and gender differences.&lt;ref name=DGinSF13/&gt; In speculative fiction, female-only worlds have been imagined to come about by the action of disease that wipes out men, along with the development of technological or mystical methods that allow female [[parthenogenic]] [[reproduction]]. The resulting society is often shown to be [[utopian]] by feminist writers. Many influential feminist utopias of this sort were written in the 1970s;&lt;ref name=DGinSF13&gt;Attebery, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=erotic1189&gt;Gaétan Brulotte &amp; John Phillips,''Encyclopedia of Erotic Literature', "Science Fiction and Fantasy", p.1189, CRC Press, 2006, {{ISBN|1-57958-441-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name =utopfantast101/&gt; the most often studied examples include Joanna Russ's ''The Female Man'', [[Suzy McKee Charnas]]'s ''[[Walk to the End of the World]]'' and ''[[Motherlines]]'', and [[Marge Piercy]]'s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]''.&lt;ref name=utopfantast101&gt;Bartter, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; Utopias imagined by male authors have generally included equality between sexes, rather than separation.&lt;ref name=utopfantast102/&gt;  Such worlds have been portrayed most often by lesbian or feminist authors; their use of female-only worlds allows the exploration of female independence and freedom from [[patriarchy]]. The societies may not necessarily be lesbian, or sexual at all—a famous early sexless example being ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'' (1915) by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]].&lt;ref name=erotic1189/&gt; Men-only societies are much less common; one example is Athos in ''[[Ethan of Athos]]'' (1986) by [[Lois McMaster Bujold]]. [[Joanna Russ]] suggests men-only societies are not commonly imagined, because men do not feel oppressed, and therefore imagining a world free of women does not imply an increase in freedom and is not as attractive.&lt;ref name=commungender329&gt;Romaine, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt;

Utopias have been used to explore the ramification of gender being either a societal construct, or a hard-wired imperative.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's studies encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen |authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1442 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mary Gentle]]'s ''Golden Witchbreed'', gender is not chosen until maturity, and gender has no bearing on social roles. In contrast, [[Doris Lessing]]'s ''[[The Marriages Between Zones Three, Four and Five]]'' (1980) suggests that men's and women's values are inherent to the sexes and cannot be changed, making a compromise between them essential. In ''My Own Utopia'' (1961) by [[Elizabeth Mann-Borgese]], gender exists but is dependent upon age rather than sex—genderless children mature into women, some of whom eventually become men.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt; Charlene Ball writes in ''Women's Studies Encyclopedia'' that use of speculative fiction to explore gender roles in future societies has been more common in the United States compared to Europe and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1442/&gt;

Eric Leif Davin, for instance, documented almost 1,000 stories published in science fiction magazines by over 200 female-identified authors between 1926 and 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Leif Davin, ''Partners in Wonder: Women and the Birth of Science Fiction, 1926-1965''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proto SF===
In the early twentieth century, some women writers rebelled against the novels in which valiant men rescued weak women or fought against humourless, authoritarian female regimes.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] wrote ''[[Herland (novel)|Herland]]'', an important early feminist utopia,&lt;ref name=WSEncyc1443&gt;{{cite book |title= Women's studies encyclopedia|last= Tierney|first= Helen |authorlink= |year= 1999|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|page=1443 |isbn=978-0-313-31073-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Virginia Woolf]] wrote ''[[Orlando (novel)|Orlando]]''. Both Perkins and Woolf identified strongly with the [[first wave feminism]] of the period,and its call for equal rights and suffrage for women.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;

===The Pulp Era and the Golden Age (1920–1950s)===
SF portrayals of future societies remained broadly patriarchal, and female characters continued to be gender stereotyped and relegated to standardised roles that supported the male protagonists. Early feminist SF visions of all-women utopias were inverted by pulp writers to tell cautionary tales about the "sex war", in which brave men had to rescue society from joyless and dictatorial women, usually to the satisfaction of both sexes.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[John W. Campbell]]'s ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'' was unusual in its covers not depicting men with ray guns and women with large breasts.&lt;ref name="pontin20081020"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Pontin |first=Mark Williams |date=November-December 2008 |title=The Alien Novelist |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/411039/the-alien-novelist/ |magazine=MIT Technology Review |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; William Knoles wrote in his 1960 ''[[Playboy (magazine)|Playboy]]'' article on the era, "Girls of the Slime God", that&lt;ref name="knoles1960"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Girls for the Slime God |last=Knoles |first=William |publisher=Obscura Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-9659569-0-3 |editor-last=Resnick |editor-first=Mike |location=Ames, IA |language=English |orig-year=1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|A quivering bosom was no novel sight for a thirties s-f hero. Space Girls expressed most of their emotions through their pectoral muscle. Bosoms swayed, trembled, heaved, shivered, danced or pouted according to their owners' moods. In fact, if a hero in those days had been a little more observant and had carried a tape measure, he could have saved himself a lot of trouble. When he opened an air lock and a gorgeous stowaway fell out, uniform ripping, it usually took him five or six pages to find out whether she was a Venusian spy or not, whereas the reader knew at once. If her torn uniform revealed pouting young breasts, she was OK—probably someone's kid sister. If she had eager, straining breasts, she was the heroine. But a girl with proud, arrogant breasts was definitely a spy—while a ripe, full bosom meant she was a Pirate Queen and all hell would soon break loose.}}

[[Isaac Asimov]] disagreed, stating in 1969 that "until 1960 there was no branch of literature anywhere (except perhaps for the children's stories in Sunday school bulletins) as puritanical as science fiction", and that Knoles had to get his quotes from one "[[Marvel Science Stories|1938-39 magazine]]" which, Asimov said, published "spicy" stories for its "few readers" before "a deserved death".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/nightfallotherst00asim#page/306/mode/2up|title=Nightfall, and other stories|last=Asimov|first=Isaac|date=1969|publisher=Doubleday|pages=307}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Floyd C.

In the 1940s, post-WWII, female writers like Judith Merril and Leigh Brackett emerged, reclaiming female characters and carving out respect in their own right.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt; [[C. L. Moore]] is an example of a woman successfully writing pulp speculative fiction tales under a genderless pen-name. Her story "No Woman Born" (1944),{{Ref label|Note1|b|b}} in which a female character's mind is transferred into a powerful robot body with feminine attributes is an early example of a work that challenged gender stereotypes of its day by combining femininity with power. Brian Attebery suggest that if the robot had appeared male, the gender would have been unremarkable or even invisible to readers, as masculine figures could be expected to be powerful.&lt;ref name=DGinSF5/&gt;

During the pulp era, unfavorable presentations of matriarchal societies, even [[dystopia]]s were common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Decoding Gender in Science Fiction|last=  Attebery|first= Brian|authorlink= Brian Attebery|page=13 |year= 2002|publisher= Routledge|location= |isbn=978-0-415-93950-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[John Wyndham]]'s ''[[Consider Her Ways]]'' (1956), for example, male rule is described as repressive to women, but freedom from patriarchy was achieved through an authoritarian female-only society modelled on [[ant]]s society.&lt;ref name=battle72&gt;Larbalestier,  "Mama Come Home; Parodies of the Sex-War" p.72&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1930s saw the beginnings of fantasy as a distinct publishing genre. Reacting against the hard, scientific, dehumanizing trends of contemporary science fiction, this new branch of SF drew on mythological and historical traditions and Romantic literature, including [[Greek mythology|Greek]] and [[Roman mythology|Roman]] mythologies, [[Norse sagas]], the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'' and Adventure stories such as [[Alexandre Dumas]]’ ''[[Three Musketeers]]''.&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;  The conventions brought with them a tendency toward patriarchy and cast women in restrictive roles defined as early as in the plays of Euripides.  These roles included that of the "helper-maiden" or of "reproductive demon".&lt;ref name=sevenglobal1/&gt;

The 1930s also saw the advent of the [[sword and sorcery]] subgenre of pulp tales, which brought overt sexualisation to the representation of women in fantasy. Although physically more capable, female characters frequently continued to act as helpers to the male leads, but were now depicted as extremely attractive and very briefly clothed.  The first female lead character of a sword and sorcery story was [[Jirel of Joiry]], created by C. L. Moore and first appearing in "Black God's Kiss" (''[[Weird Tales]]'', volume 24, number 4, October 1934).

===New Wave (1960-1970s)===
Whereas the 1940s and 50s have been called the Golden Age of science fiction in general, the 1960s and 1970s are regarded as the most important and influential periods in the study of gender in speculative fiction.&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;

This creative period saw the appearance of many influential novels by female authors, including [[Ursula K. Le Guin]]'s ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'' (1969), described as the book with which SF "lost its innocence on matters of sex and gender", and ''[[The Dispossessed]]'' (1974);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Joanna Russ]]'s most important works, particularly ''[[The Female Man]]'' (1975), regarded by many as the central work of women's SF;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; and ''[[The Two of Them]]'' (1978); [[Anne McCaffrey]]'s prescient cyborg novel, ''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' (1969);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;  [[Vonda McIntyre]]'s two most influential novels, ''[[The Exile Waiting]]'' (1975) and ''[[Dreamsnake]]'' (1978);&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Marge Piercy]]’s ''[[Woman on the Edge of Time]]'' (1976), the most important contribution to feminist sf by an author known mainly for realistic work;&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; and several novels by [[Octavia Butler]], especially ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) and ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'' (1980), which have been described as groundbreaking, and established an African-American female voice in SF.

Important short stories included many by [[James Tiptree Jr.]] (a male pseudonym used by Alice Sheldon),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Alien plots: female subjectivity and the divine in the light of James Tiptree's "A momentary taste of being"|last= Van der Spek|first= Inez |authorlink= |year= 2000|publisher=Liverpool University Press |pages=7–8 |isbn=978-0-85323-814-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; for instance ''[[The Women Men Don't See]]'' (1973), ''[[The Girl Who Was Plugged In]]'' (1973), and ''[[The Screwfly Solution]]'' (1977).{{Ref label|Note1|c|c}}&lt;ref name=triumffeminism3&gt;Freedman&lt;/ref&gt;

These works coincided with the beginnings of application of feminist theory to SF,.&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt;  creating a self-consciously [[feminist science fiction]]. Feminist SF has been distinguished from earlier feminist utopian fiction by its greater attention to characterisation and inclusion of gender equality.&lt;ref name=utopfantast102&gt;Bartter, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

Male writers also began to approach depiction of gender in new ways, with [[Samuel R. Delany]] establishing himself as the most radical voice among male SF figures for representations of alternative sexualities and gender-models in a series of major works, most importantly (with respect to gender), in ''[[Triton (novel)|Triton]]'' (1976).&lt;ref name="triumffeminism2"/&gt; [[Gary Westfahl]] points out that "Heinlein is a problematic case for feminists; on the one hand, his works often feature strong female characters and vigorous statements that women are equal to or even superior to men; but these characters and statements often reflect hopelessly stereotypical attitudes about typical female attributes. It is disconcerting, for example, that in ''[[Expanded Universe (Heinlein)|Expanded Universe]]'' Heinlein calls for a society where all lawyers and politicians are women, essentially on the grounds that they possess a mysterious feminine practicality that men cannot duplicate." &lt;ref&gt;Gary Westfahl, 'Superladies in Waiting: How the Female Hero Almost Emerges in Science Fiction', ''Foundation'', vol. 58, 1993, pp. 42-62.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern SF (1980–2000s)===
By the 1980s the intersection of feminism and SF was already a major factor in the production of the literature itself.&lt;ref name=triumffeminism3/&gt;

Authors such as [[Nicola Griffith]] and [[Sheri S. Tepper]] frequently write on gender-related themes. Tepper's work has been described as "the definition of feminist science fiction", and her treatment of gender has varied from early optimistic science fantasies, in which women were equally as capable as men, to more pessimistic works, including ''[[The Gate to Women's Country]]'', in which men are the cause of war and pollution and true equality can only be achieved by transcending humanity altogether.&lt;ref name=utopfantast103--104&gt;Bartter, pp.103-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hugo Award|Hugo]], [[Nebula Award|Nebula]] and [[Arthur C. Clarke Award|Arthur C. Clarke award]] winning [[Ancillary Justice]] by [[Ann Leckie]] (2013) portrays a society where gender is an unimportant detail in people's lives. It refers to most characters as female, unless they're talking in a different language than the dominant one. This leaves the gender of most characters unclear. The reader, used to books that consistently use male pronouns, is constantly slightly on edge, because of the consistent use of 'she', 'her' etc.

The September 2017 anthology, [http://topsidepress.com/ Meanwhile, Elsewhere], is a collection of short stories written by trans-identified authors about trans-identified characters.  While these authors are well known to Queer audiences, they are new to Speculative, Sci-Fi and Fantasy readers. The anthology covers multiple genres, from [[Ryka Aoki]]'s "The Gift", in which the main character identifies as trans and everything is fine, to [[Jeanne Thornton]]'s "Angels Are Here To Help Us", which explores access to technology, money and privilege in relation to trans identity.  The book was edited by Cat Fitzpatrick and [[Casey Plett]] and was published by Topside Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topsidepress.com/|title=The Post-Reality Expeditionist's Supply Store|website=The Post-Reality Expeditionist's Supply Store|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bitchmedia.org/article/meanwhile-elsewhere-book-review|title=“Meanwhile, Elsewhere” Envisions a New World for Trans Readers|work=Bitch Media|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Sherrie Inness has said that the portrayals of tough women in later science fiction embody women's fantasies of empowerment,&lt;ref name=toughgirls23&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 23|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the characters of Sharrow in the [[Iain M. Banks]]' novel ''[[Against a Dark Background]]'' (1993) or Alex in the film ''[[Nemesis 2: Nebula|Nemesis 2]]'', who both physically overpower male attackers.&lt;ref name=toughgirls23/&gt;&lt;ref name=toughgirls25&gt;{{cite book |title= Tough girls: women warriors and wonder women in popular culture|last= Inness|first= Sherrie A. |authorlink= |year= 1998|publisher= Published by University of Pennsylvania Press|page= 25|isbn=978-0-8122-3466-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Early television depicted women primarily as idealized "perfect housewives" or (often [[black (race)|black]]) domestic workers.&lt;ref name=fantgirls1&gt;Helford, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-1960s and 1970s, cultural mores had relaxed, and sexual objectification of women became more commonplace. This period also saw diversification in women's roles, with blurring between the roles of middle-class housewife and working mother and the representations of women of different age, race, class, sexual orientation. The appearance of strong female characters, such as in ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'', remained limited by associations of power with male approval.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2&gt;Helford, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s and 70s also saw the beginnings of SF and fantasy elements being incorporated into television programming.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt;

Popular early SF programming in the 1960s reconciled the use of SF tropes that empowered women with stereotypes of women's social domains and femininity. This was seen in popular series such as ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]'' and ''[[Bewitched]]'', both of which have female protagonists with magical abilities.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt;  ''Bewitched'''s Samantha is a witch who chooses to use her abilities as a home-maker, and her husband prefers that she limits such displays of power as much as possible, particularly when they could challenge his ego. Most of her uses of magic were to save her husband appearing foolish in front of his peers or undoing interference from her more empowered and feminist mother, Endora.&lt;ref name=fantgirls2/&gt; In contrast, the titular character of ''I Dream of Jeannie'' was inept in her house-wifely duties and was more likely to use her magic when she felt it appropriate. However, this was always in the service of her "Master", who demanded her nature as a [[genie]] be kept secret. Jeannie's subservience and skimpy clothing also identified her primarily as a sex object.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3&gt;Helford, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Both programs showed women gaining more power and prominence through the metaphor of magic, but that this power was limited by women's willingness to obey male authority.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

The 1960s also saw the first speculative presentations of women outside the realm of domestic life.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt; ''[[Star Trek]]'''s [[Nyota Uhura|Lt. Uhura]] is a famous early example of a woman space explorer, and her race made her a role-model for black women in particular. Her inclusion in the series is credited with bringing more women into science fiction fandom. The character [[Uhura#Role_model|was seen]] as a success of the feminist and [[civil rights movement]]s of the era, representing the ideal of racial equality and women's ability to find meaningful employment outside of marriage and family. However, her role never rose beyond that of futuristic [[receptionist]], and her uniform and prominent but generally silent placement in the background of scenes made her the series primary eye candy.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

SF series of the 1970s followed in a similar vein, with speculative elements used to physically empower women, while society required that they pretend to be typical and non-threatening. Examples include ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'' and the television adaption of ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|Wonder Woman]]''.&lt;ref name=fantgirls3/&gt;

A number of occupations are classified under the broad term of ''[[graphic designer]]''. Graphic design career paths cover all ends of the [[creative industries|creative spectrum]]. Many of these job descriptions overlap heavily.

==Graphic Art Managers==
The following are positions or responsibilities and usually titles, held by experienced graphic designers in related management roles:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Creative Director===
A [[creative director|Creative Director's]] range of experience can be broad and encompass a number of disciplines; visual design; copywriting, art direction, advertising account director, film/video director. A Creative Directors job is to initiate the creative concept of a project and drive the direction of the project. The role of a Creative Director is to formulate creative concepts, whether it is an advertising campaign, brand identity, TV commercial, marketing campaign. A Creative Director was often referred to the 'Ideas Guy' and works with a team of 'creatives' - art director, graphic designer, copywriter, film director to produce the concept and final production.

===Art Director===
[[Art director]]s make sure that illustrators and production artists produce and complete their work on time and to the creative director or client's satisfaction. Art directors also play a major role in the development of a project by making decisions on the visual elements of the project, and by giving the final say on the selection of models, art, props, colors, and other elements. Art directors need advanced training in graphic design as they often do artwork and designing themselves. However, an art director's time may be consumed doing supervisory and administrative work.(See link for more information)

===Art Production Manager===
Art production managers or [[Advertising agency#Other departments and personnel|traffic manager]]s oversee the production aspect of art to improve efficiency and cost effectiveness. Art production managers supervise artists or advise the supervisors of artists. Creative directors and art directors often assume the role of art production managers, especially when production cost is not a critical enough concern to designate a manager for the specific role.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==Hands-on Graphic Designer==
The following are positions or responsibilities, not necessarily titles, held by art directors and graphic designers:{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

===Brand identity Developer===
[[Brand identity]] design is concerned with the visual aspects of a company or organization's brand or identity. A brand identity design is the visual element that represents how a company wants to be seen; it is the company's visual identity, and is how a company illustrates its ‘image.’ A company's brand identity can be represented in terms of design through a unique [[logo]], or [[signage]], and is then often integrated throughout all the elements of a company's materials such as business cards, stationery, packaging, media advertising, promotions, and more. Brand identity may include logo design. Brand identity development is usually a collaborative effort between creative directors, art directors, copywriters, account managers and the client.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Broadcast Designers====
A [[broadcast designer]] is a person involved with creating graphic designs and electronic media incorporated in television productions that are used by [[character generator]] (CG) operators. A broadcast designer may have a degree in [[digital media]] (or a similar degree), or is self-taught in the software needed to create such content.

====Logo Designer====
The job of a [[logo design]]er is to provide a new and innovative way to express the key points of a company through an image. Logo designers take the information given to them by the client and work, using their own creativity along with marketing strategy to find an appropriate image that their client can use to represent what they are trying to encourage, sell, or what they are. It is not likely that a company will specialize in logo design or have a position for a designated logo designer. Art directors and graphic designers usually perform logo designs.

=== Illustrator ===
[[Illustrator]]s conceptualize and create [[illustrations]] that represent an idea or a story through two-dimensional or three-dimensional images. Illustrators may do drawings for printed materials such as books, magazines, and other publications, or for commercial products such as textiles, packaging, wrapping paper, greeting cards, calendars, stationery, and more.

Illustrators use many different media, from pencil and paint to digital formatting, to prepare and create their illustrations. An illustrator consults with clients in order to determine what illustrations will best meet the story they are trying to tell, or what message they are trying to communicate.

Illustrating may be a secondary skill requirement of graphic design or a specialty skill of a freelance artist, usually known for a unique style of illustrating. Illustration may be published separately as in [[fine art]]. However, illustrations are usually inserted into [[page layout]]s for [[communication design]] in the context of graphic design professions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Image Developer====
Similar to illustration are other methods of [[image development (visual arts)|developing images]] such as [[photography]], [[3D modeling]], and [[image editing]]. Creative professionals in these positions are not usually called illustrators, but are utilized the same way. Photographers are likely to freelance. 3D modelers are likely to be employed for long-term projects. Image editing is usually a secondary skill to either of the above, but may also be a specialty to aid web development, software development, or multimedia development in a job title known as multimedia specialist. Although these skills may require technical knowledge, graphic design skills may be applied as well.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Multimedia Developer====
Multimedia developers may come from a graphic design or illustration background and apply those talents to motion, sound, or interactivity. [[Motion graphic design|Motion designers]] are graphic designers for motion. [[Animator]]s are illustrators for motion. [[Videographer]]s are photographers for motion. Multimedia developers may also image edit, [[Sound editor (filmmaking)|sound edit]], program, or compose [[multimedia]] just as multimedia specialists.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Content Developer====
[[Content (media)|Content]] developer is a generic term used for describing illustrators, visual image developers, and multimedia developers in software and web development. The term has a broader scope that includes non-graphical content as well. A generic name for content that is used in a digital composition are [[digital asset]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

====Visual Journalist====
[[Visual Journalist]]s, also known as Infographic Artists create [[information graphics]] or Infographics; visual representations of information, data or knowledge. These graphics are used anywhere where information needs to be explained quickly or simply, such as in signs, maps, journalism, technical writing, and education. They are also used extensively as tools by computer scientists, mathematicians, and statisticians to ease the process of developing and communicating conceptual information. They are applied in all aspects of scientific visualization.

===Layout artist===
A [[page layout|layout artist]] deals with the structure and layout of images and text in a pleasing format. This can include magazine work, [[brochure]]s, [[Flyer (pamphlet)|flyer]]s, [[book]]s, [[CD]] booklets, [[poster]]s, and similar formats. For magazines and similar productions, [[color]], [[typeface]], text formatting, graphic layout and more must be considered. Is the chosen typeface good for long term reading, or will the eyes get tired? Does that title typeface fit the feel of the rest of the article? Are the photos arranged in such a way that is pleasing to the eye, and directs the reader in the right flow or direction? These are just some of the questions that layout artists must ask themselves. Page layouts are usually done by art directors, graphic designers, production artists or a combination of those positions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

[[Entry level job|Entry level]] layout work is often known as [[paste up]] art. Entry level layout graphic designers are often known as [[production artist]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} In an [[Advertising agencies#In-house advertising agencies|in-house art department]], layout artists are sometimes known as [[DTP artist]]s or DTP associates.

====Interface Designer====
[[Interface design]]ers are [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) layout artists. They are employed by multimedia, software, and web development companies. Because [[Graphical control element (software)|graphical control elements]] are interactive, interface design often overlaps [[interaction design]]. Because interfaces are not usually composed as single [[computer file]]s, interface design may require technical understanding, including graphical integration with code. Because interfaces may require hundreds of assets, knowledge of how to automate graphic production may be required. An interface designer may hold the [[job title]] of web designer in a [[web development]] company.

====Web Designer====
A [[web design]]er's work could be viewed by thousands of people every day. Web designers create the pages, layout, and graphics for web pages, and play a key role in the development of a website. Web designers have the task of creating the look and feel of a website by choosing the style, and by designing attractive graphics, images, and other visual elements, and adapting them for the website's pages. Web designers also design and develop the navigation tools of a site. Web designers  may make decisions regarding what content is included on a web page, where things are placed, and how the aesthetic and continuity is maintained from one screen to the next. All of this involves skill and training in computer graphics, graphic design, and in the latest in computer and web technology.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

Depending on the scope of the project, web design may involve collaboration between [[software engineering|software engineers]] and graphic designers. The graphic design of a website may be as simple as a page layout [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or handling just the graphics in an [[HTML editor]], while the advance coding is done separately by [[programmers]]. In other cases, graphic designers may be challenged to become both graphic designer and programmer in the process of web design in positions often known as [[web master]]s.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}

==== Package Designer ====
A [[package design]]er or packaging technician may utilize technical skills aside from graphic design. Knowledge of cuts, crease, folding, nature and behavior of the packaging material such as paper, corrugated sheet, synthetic or other type of materials may also be required. A customer may see the top/outside of a package at first, but may also be drawn to other package design features. A packaging design may require [[Three-dimensional space]] layout skills in addition to visual communication to consider how well a design works at multiple angles. [[Computer-aided design|CAD]] software applications specifically for packaging design may be utilized

[[Image:Huff 'n'puff equipment.png|right|frame|Huff and Puff Apparatus respiration demonstration]]

The '''huff and puff apparatus''' is used in school [[biology]] labs to demonstrate that [[carbon dioxide]] is a product of [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]].  A pupil breathes in and out of the middle tube. The glass tubing is arranged in such a way that one flask bubbles as the pupils breathes in, the other as the pupil breathes out. A suitable carbon dioxide indicator, such as [[limewater]] or [[bicarbonate indicator]] shows the increased presence of carbon dioxide in the outgoing breath.This turns the bicarbonate into milky white substance.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1373">Funded by the [[National Science Foundation]], the '''Innovative Technology Experiences for Students''' and Teachers (ITEST) program was established in 2003 to address the looming shortage of technology workers in the United States. ITEST engages students and teachers in authentic, hands-on learning experiences in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (commonly referred to as '[[Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math|STEM]]' or 'SET' [more common in the U.K.]).

As of early 2012, the program is in its ninth year. Over 195 individual projects across 43 states have been funded. It has impacted:
* over 225,800 students, grades 6-12
* over 8,000 teachers
* over 3,000 parents and caregivers

The ITEST Learning Resource Center (ITEST LRC) at [[Education Development Center]] assists the projects in building bridges between formal and informal learning by facilitating an inclusive community of practice. Findings and lessons learned are shared nationally to improve policy and practice. Visit the website with the link below, or view a 2-page overview (Snapshot).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8280">The '''International Center for Technology Assessment''' (ICTA) is a U.S. non-profit bi-partisan organization, based in [[Washington, D.C.]]. ICTA aims to provide the public with full assessments and analyses of technological impacts on society. ICTA explores the economic, ethical, social, environmental and political impacts that can result from the applications of technology or technological systems.

==Objectives of the Center==

ICTA seeks to assist the public and policy makers in better understanding how technology affects society.

===Nanotechnology===
ICTA lobbies for stronger regulation of [[nanotechnology]] through its Nanotechnology Project ''NanoAction''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nanoaction.org/nanoaction/index.cfm Introduction to NanoAction] NanoAction website&lt;/ref&gt; The [[implications of nanotechnology]] run the gamut from the [[Nanomedicine|medical]], ethical, mental, legal and environmental applications, to fields such as engineering, biology, chemistry, computing, materials science, military applications, and communications. Nanotechnology is improving current techniques along with creating new tools and capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Saini|first=Rajiv |author2=Saini, Santosh |author3=Sharma, Sugandha|title=Nanotechnology: The Future Medicine|journal=Journal of Cutaneous and Aesthetic Surgery|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=32–33|doi=10.4103/0974-2077.63301|pmid=20606992|pmc=2890134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush administration in 2007 decided that no special regulations or labeling of [[nanoparticles]] were required. "The consumer is being made the guinea pig", said George Kimbrell of the International Center for Technology Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planetark.com/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/43305/story.htm FDA Says No New Labeling For Nanotech Products] 27-Jul-07, Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, a coalition of over 40 [[civil society]] groups endorsed a statement of principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials |publisher=International Center for Technology Assessment |year=2008 |url=http://www.icta.org/global/actions.cfm?page=15&amp;type=366&amp;topic=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for [[Precautionary principle|precautionary action]] related to nanotechnology.  The coalition called for strong, comprehensive oversight of the new technology and its products in the International Center for Technology Assessment's report ''Principles for the Oversight of Nanotechnologies and Nanomaterials''.&lt;ref name="JulyCTA07release"&gt;{{cite press release| title = Broad international coalition issues urgent call for strong oversight of nanotechnology| publisher = International Center for Technology Assessment| date = 2007-07-31| url = http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| accessdate = 2007-10-19| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071107065131/http://www.icta.org/press/release.cfm?news_id=26| archivedate = 2007-11-07| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===

Among the projects that ICTA is working upon are ''Patent Watch'', an effort to put stricter ethical and public interest restrictions on patents.

ICTA is also concerned about some of the developments that are taking place in the area of [[Transhumanism|human biotechnology]]. ICTA warns that "a new eugenics age has begun".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icta.org/biotech/index.cfm Human Biotechnology: The Age of the "New Eugenics"] ICTA website&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, this refers to highly profit-driven areas of biotechnology such as [[genetic engineering]], [[genetic screening]], and [[cloning]].

ICTA, in collaboration with approximately 100 other organizations, including [[Friends of the Earth]] and the [[ETC Group (AGETC)|ETC Group]], have put forth a moratorium against [[synthetic biology]]. These organizations claim that “the technology could lead to environmental hazards of Frankensteinian proportions, including new strains of unstoppable invasive species and unpredictable hazards to human health.” They seek global regulation and [[biosafety]] measures on synthetic biology research and technologies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/03/13/10672301-what-to-do-about-synthetic-life What to do about synthetic life? ] By Alan Boyle, Retrieved 14 April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

ICTA also does a lot of work in the areas of [[corporate accountability]] and economics, trying to ensure the observance of ethical principles as part of business practices. Thus, ICTA is a founding member of the ''Center for Corporate Policy'' that works actively in these areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corporatepolicy.org/ Center for Corporate Policy] website&lt;/ref&gt;

ICTA contributes strongly to the areas of [[global warming]] and the environment. In particular, they are concerned about the modern threat to the environment of "biological pollution", such as the [[invasive species]]. Also, the introduction of [[genetically modified plants]] and [[:Genetically modified organism#Transgenic animals|animals]] is of concern. [[Pharming (genetics)|Crops engineered to produce pharmaceuticals (Pharming)]], or resist herbicides may well spread [[genetic pollution]] by cross-pollinating with weeds or other crops, and ICTA is actively addressing these issues.

==History==

ICTA was formed in 1994. Its executive director is consumer advocate Andrew Kimbrell. Its sister organization is the [[Center for Food Safety]].

In 2004, ICTA took an active part in [[Monsanto Canada Inc. v. Schmeiser]], a leading Supreme Court of Canada case on patent rights for biotechnology. The case involved [[Percy Schmeiser]], a Saskatchewan canola farmer. Intervening on Schmeiser’s behalf were a consortium of six non-government organizations, among which was the International Center for Technology Assessment. Schmeiser lost the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycommons.org/entity.jsp?entity=international_center_for_technology_assessment Canada’s Supreme Court Hears Percy Schmeiser’s Appeal], History Commons, January 20, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/techpolicy/2004-01-19-schmeiser_x.htm Small farmer's fight becomes anti-biotech crusade] By Paul Elias, USA TODAY, 1/19/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Friends of the Earth]] and ICTA filed a formal petition with the [[Food and Drug Administration]] for better monitoring and regulating of cosmetic and toiletry products containing [[nanoparticles]] and stated they would sue if the FDA does not take adequate action in 180 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Keay Davidson|title=FDA urged to limit nanoparticle use in cosmetics and sunscreens|publisher=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/05/17/MNGFHIT1161.DTL|accessdate=2007-04-20|date=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Irish Fiscal Advisory Council''' ('''IFAC'''; {{lang-ga|Comhairle Chomhairleach Bhuiséadach na hÉireann}}) is a non-department statutory body providing independent assessment and analysis of the Irish Government's economic and budgetary forecasts, and fiscal approach.  IFAC monitors compliance with EU fiscal rules and agreements.  IFAC was created to counter the "[[green jersey agenda]]" which was identified as a contributor to the Irish financial crisis.

==Purpose==
{{see also|Put on the green jersey}}
IFAC was formed as part of a program of reform of Ireland’s "budgetary architecture" post the Irish economic crisis.  It was established on an interim basis in July 2011, and legally constituted under the Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/FRA.pdf|title=Fiscal Responsibility Act 2012 | publisher=Department of Finance | date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was part of the EU-IMF Programme of Financial Support for Ireland (and whose terms required the creation of a "budgetary advisory council to provide an independent assessment of Government forecasts").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/ireland-business-blog-with-lisa-ocarroll/2010/nov/28/ireland-bailout-full-government-statement|title=Ireland bailout: full Irish government statement|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/IFAC_DoF_Forecasting_MoU_2018_Signed.pdf|title=Memorandum of Understanding between the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the Department of Finance relating to the “Endorsement Function” of the Council under the Fiscal Responsibility Acts 2012 and 2013|publisher=IFAC Department of Finance|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The formation of IFAC was a response to the perceived failure of established Irish economic and Irish regulatory institutions to anticipate and warn over the consequences of the Irish credit bubble (i.e. the so-called "[[put on the green jersey|green jersey agenda"]]), and/or engage in the concerns that were being raised by various international monitors at the time (IMF and OECD) regarding Ireland's economic situation.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/failure-to-heed-warnings-was-cause-of-crash-trichet-30949719.html|title=Failure to heed warnings was cause of crash: Trichet | publisher=Irish Independent | date=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/banking-inquiry/fitzgerald-my-regrets-over-crash-are-with-me-until-i-die-30985532.html|title=FitzGerald: My regrets over crash are with me until I die|publisher=Irish Independent|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC performs a similar role to the "[[Office for Budget Responsibility]]" in the United Kingdom (also formed after the financial crisis), and other equivalent members of the "[[EU Independent Fiscal Institutions Network|Network of European Union Independent Fiscal Institutions]]" (which IFAC joined in September 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/what-is-the-irish-fiscal-advisory-council-for-31277271.html|title=What is the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for? | publisher=Irish Independent | date=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/john-mchale-the-man-whose-job-it-is-to-say-no-minister-30087657.html|title=John McHale The man whose job it is to say 'No Minister' | publisher=Irish Independent | date=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC is structured as a Council of 5 members (one Chairperson) and a supporting analytical team of circa 6.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/gov/budgeting/Ireland.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=OECD Journal on Budgeting | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://audgen.gov.ie/documents/annualreports/2015/report/en/Chapter18.pdf|title=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council| publisher=C&amp;AG Report 2015 | date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The formal mandate of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council (per IFAC website) is to:
* Assess and endorse the Irish Government’s official macroeconomic forecasts.
* Assess the Irish Government's budgetary forecasts.
* Assess the broader fiscal stance of the Irish Government.
* Monitor compliance with legislated fiscal rules by the Irish Government.

IFAC has been well received by Irish financial commentators and its publications are widely covered in the Irish media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/editorial/fiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fopinion%2Feditorial%2Ffiscal-advisory-council-s-timely-warning-1.3211833|title=Fiscal Advisory Council’s timely warning|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejournal.ie/fiscal-council-budget-2018-3581853-Sep2017/|title=Fiscal Council says Ireland is still vulnerable and warns against extra Budget spending|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=5 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/chairman-fiscal-advisory-council-theres-been-a-very-strong-recovery-we-are-now-living-within-our-means-36500320.html|title=Chairman, Fiscal Advisory Council: 'There's been a very strong recovery - we are now living within our means'|publisher=thejournal.ie|date=18 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.businesspost.ie/opinion/jack-horgan-jones-mchales-advice-ignored-ifac-not-afraid-bare-teeth-371851|title=Even if the government refuses listen, having this kind of analysis in the public domain is vital|publisher=Sunday Business Post|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/70b38194-f568-11e3-91a8-00144feabdc0|title=Ireland needs continued austerity says watchdog|publisher=Financial Times|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

The key mandated publications of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council are:
* Bi-annual Fiscal Assessment Report (FAR) (produced after the Irish autumn Budget, and the spring Stability Update).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/fiscal-assessment-reports/|title=Fiscal Assessment Reports|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bi-annual Endorsement Letters of macroeconomic forecasts (produced in advance of the Irish autumn Budget, and the spring Stability Update).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/endorsement-letters/|title=Endorsement Letters|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annual Pre-Budget Statement (produced before the Irish autumn Budget).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/pre-budget-statements/|title=Pre-Budget Statements|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Annual Ex-Post Assessment of Compliance with the Domestic Budgetary Rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/ex-post-assessments-of-compliance-with-the-domestic-budgetary-rule/|title=Assessments of Compliance with the Domestic Budgetary Rule|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has commenced an annual conference titled “Path for the Public Finances” that was started in March 2017. The goal is to bring attention to long-term Irish State finance issues relevant for Ireland. International speakers attend.  Each annual event is intended to focus on a particular theme, which has been:
* March 2017 Path for the Public Finances: Fiscal Risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/path-for-the-public-finances-2017-fiscal-risks/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2017 Fiscal Risks|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* March 2018 Path for the Public Finances: Too Hot, Too Cold! The Irish Cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/ifac-conference/path-for-the-public-finances-2018-too-hot-too-cold-the-irish-cycle/|title=Path for the Public Finances 2018 Too Hot Too Cold The Irish Cycle|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC also publishes Analytical Notes and Working Papers in areas of concern to Irish financial stability (including House Prices, Tax Receipts, Public Debt, and EU Rules/Guidelines).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/analytical-notes/|title=IFAC Analytical Notes Series|publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Focus==

The IFAC looks at major areas that could affect the stability and confidence levels of Irish macroeconomic forecasts, and/or, create the potential for economic shocks.

===Distortion of Irish GDP and GNP===
{{see also|Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland is a leading [[corporate tax haven]] (see [[Corporate haven#Corporate tax haven lists|Corporate tax haven lists]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/ireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401?mode=sample&amp;auth-failed=1&amp;pw-origin=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.irishtimes.com%2Fbusiness%2Feconomy%2Fireland-is-the-world-s-biggest-corporate-tax-haven-say-academics-1.3528401|title=Ireland is the world’s biggest corporate ‘tax haven’, say academics|quote=Study claims State shelters more multinational profits than the entire Caribbean|publisher=Irish Times|date=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Extreme distortions of national economic data is a well-known feature of [[corporate tax haven]]s.&lt;ref name="qqtz"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://qz.com/1300880/tax-havens-mean-40-of-foreign-direct-investments-are-artificial/|title=How tax havens turn economic statistics into nonsense|publisher=Quartz|date=11 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="imfx"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2018/06/inside-the-world-of-global-tax-havens-and-offshore-banking/damgaard.htm|title=Piercing the Veil, FINANCE &amp; DEVELOPMENT, JUNE 2018, VOL. 55, NO. 2 |publisher=IMF Finance &amp; Development|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The top 15 GDP-per-capita countries are heavily represented by traditional and corporate tax havens (see [[Corporate haven#GDP-per-capita tax haven proxy|GDP-per-capita and tax havens]]).  The artificial nature of the distortion makes the haven prone to more severe credit cycles as international capital markets misprice the cost of credit to the tax haven in benign times, only to reverse it sharply in  times of global stress (see [[Corporate haven#Distorted GDP/GNP|tax haven cycles]]).  

{{quote|A stunning $12 trillion—almost 40 percent of all foreign direct investment positions globally—is completely artificial: it consists of financial investment passing through empty corporate shells with no real activity. These investments in empty corporate shells almost always pass through well-known tax havens.

IFAC was one of the members of the economic steering group ((the Economic Statistics Review Group, or "ESRG"), that [[Philip R. Lane]], the Governor of the [[Central Bank of Ireland]], convened to create a new economic statistic to replace Irish GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/newsevents/documents/reportoftheeconomicstatisticsreviewgroup/ESRG_Presentation_-_Press_Briefing.pdf|title=ESRG Presentation and CSO Response|publisher=Central Statistics Office|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/analysis-and-comment/2017/0204/850115-leprechaun-economics/|title=Leprechaun-proofing economic data|publisher=RTE News|date=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The metric, also called GNI*, is circa 30% below Irish GDP.&lt;ref name="gni1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/cso-paints-a-very-different-picture-of-irish-economy-with-new-measure-1.3155462|title=CSO paints a very different picture of Irish economy with new measure|publisher=Irish Times|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gni2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/new-economic-leprechaun-on-loose-as-rate-of-growth-plunges-35932663.html|title=New economic Leprechaun on loose as rate of growth plunges|publisher=Irish Independent|date=15 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish Public Debt===
{{see also|Leprechaun economics}}
{{see also|Modified gross national income}}

Ireland's economic data is distorted by the tax planning schemes of US multinationals based in Ireland (i.e. "[[double Irish]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/business/economy/europe-points-finger-at-ireland-over-tax-avoidance-1.3417948|title=Europe points finger at Ireland over tax avoidance|publisher=Irish Times|date=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While traditionally this distortion manifested itself in divergences between Ireland's GDP and GNI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economic-incentives.blogspot.ie/2013/04/gdp-and-international-comparisons.html|title=International GNI to GDP Comparisons|publisher=Seamus Coffey, University College Cork|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as the schemes have become more developed (i.e. "[[double Irish|capital allowances for intangibles]]"), Irish GNI and GNP have also become materially distorted.  This was most evident in the "[[leprechaun economics]]" affair when Apple restructured its controversial Irish operations (the subject of the EU Commission's €13bn fine) in January 2015 and Irish GDP rose 26.3% while Irish GNP rose 18.7%.

The problem of assessing Ireland's public indebtedness post "[[leprechaun economics]]" and "[[Modified gross national income|modified GNI]]", is captured on page 34 of the OECD 2018 Ireland Survey:&lt;ref name="oecd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/OECD-survey.pdf|title=OECD Ireland Survey 2018|publisher=OECD|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GDP basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 78.8% is not of concern.
* On a Gross Public Debt-to-GNI* basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at 116.5% is more serious, but not alarming.
* On a Gross Public Debt Per Capita basis, Ireland's 2015 figure at over $62,686 per capita, exceeds every other OECD country, except Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/irish-news/politics/national-debt-now-44000-per-head-35904197.html|title=National debt now €44000 per head|publisher=Irish Independent|date=7 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

IFAC introduced a new measure of benchmarking Irish public debt by comparing to Tax Revenues (similar to the Debt-to-EBITDA ratio used in capital markets).  On this basis, Ireland's 2016 Gross Public Debt-to-Tax Revenues is 282.9%, which is the 4th highest of the EU-28 (after Greece, Portugal, and Cyprus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Presentation.pdf|title=Debt levels remain high following the crisis June FAR Slide 7 | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Fiscal-Assessment-Report-June-2017-Final.pdf|title=Section 1.2.2 Recent Fiscal Context June FAR Page 14  | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It shows how difficult making Ireland's EU Debt Rule committments will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/Website-AN5.pdf | title=Future Implications of the Debt Rule | publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council | date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From this, IFAC advised the Irish Government against using funds, or proceeds from State asset sales, to stimulate the fast-growing Irish economy, and instead use for debt repayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rte.ie/news/business/2017/0607/880813-national-debt-it-hasnt-gone-away-you-know/|title=National Debt - it hasn't gone away, you know | publisher=RTE News | date=June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. Multinationals===

Eurostat (2015)]]
Corporation tax was 15.1% of Irish tax revenues in 2016 with 80% coming from foreign-owned multinationals.&lt;ref name="rev1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revenue.ie/en/corporate/documents/research/corporation-tax-returns-2016.pdf|title=An Analysis of 2015 Corporation Tax Returns and 2016 Payments|publisher=Revenue Commissioners|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Irish corporate tax revenue jumped 49% in 2015 alone (from €4.61bn to €6.87bn),&lt;ref name="rev1"/&gt; the year of Apple's Irish restructuring.  This is in an environment where foreign-owned multinationals, attracted to Ireland's corporate tax system, contributed €28.3bn in payments to the Irish economy in 2016 (corporate taxes, wages, and capital spending).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.idaireland.com/newsroom/publications/ireland-s-economic-and-competitiveness-update-q1|title=IDA Ireland Competitiveness|publisher=IDA Ireland|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also in an environment where the 2017 US [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017|TCJA]] legislation, and the EU "digital tax" (and [[Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base|CCCTB]]), are threats to the Irish corporate tax system. 

IFAC have reported on the volatility and concentration of Ireland corporation tax payments, with the top 20 payers now making up almost 40% of all corporation tax payments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiscalcouncil.ie/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/AN-10-Challenges-Forecasting-Irish-Corporation-Tax-Final-Web.pdf|title=Analytical Note 10 Challenges Forecasting Irish Corporation Tax |publisher=Irish Fiscal Advisory Council|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chairperson of IFAC, Seamus Coffey, was separately commissioned by the Irish Government to review Ireland's Corporate Tax Code.&lt;ref name="coffey1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/updates/minister-donohoe-publishes-review-of-irelands-corporation-tax-code/|title=Minister Donohoe publishes Review of Ireland’s Corporation Tax Code|publisher=Department of Finance|date=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coffey2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finance.gov.ie/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/170912-Review-of-Irelands-Corporation-Tax-Code.pdf|title=REVIEW OF IRELAND’S CORPORATION TAX CODE, PRESENTED TO THE MINISTER FOR FINANCE AND PUBLIC EXPENDITURE AND REFORM BY MR.

IFAC noted Ireland’s exposure to U.S. multinationals in the June 2018 report and the impact of a single multinational leaving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/business/irish/losing-just-one-big-multinational-would-leave-ireland-nursing-a-276m-tax-shortfall-36981003.html|title=Losing just one big multinational would leave Ireland nursing a €276m tax shortfall|publisher=Irish Independent|date=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The high exposure of Ireland's economy to U.S. multinationals (14 of Ireland's top 20 firms, a quarter of the Irish labourforce), is discussed in more detail [[Corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland#Low tax economy|here]].  The former IMF mission chief to Ireland, [[Ashoka Mody]], has emphasised how the changes to international tax regimes (i.e. [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]]), could make this event likely, and on a bigger and synchronised scale (discussed [[Double Irish arrangement#Effect of Tax Cuts and Jobs Act|here]]):

'''Kurt Löwenstein''' (18 May 1885 in [[Bleckede]] – 8 May 1939 in Paris) was a German [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany|USPD]]/[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician, Socialist reform pedagogue and one of the founders of [[Socialist Youth of Germany - Falcons]].

==Family and education==

Löwenstein's father, Bernhard Löwenstein, had a clothing shop, which brought the family a modest income. His mother Jeanette, born Blumenthal, died of [[cancer]] in 1892. In 1895 Kurt Löwenstein went to [[Judaism|Jewish]] private school in [[Hanover]]. In 1899 he went to high school where he earned tuition by delivering newspapers and holding after-classes where he helped school classmates with homework.

Between 1904 and 1907 Löwenstein studied [[Theology]] and [[Philosophy]] in [[Halberstadt]] and he was accepted into the orthodox Rabbi school in Berlin. At the same time he also attended Philosophical and Pedagogical courses at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelm University]]. In 1908 he was offered the position of the Rabbi in Hanover but refused it because of religious doubts.

On 29 April 1911 he married Mara Kerwel (1891-1969), a chemist. When they got married, they signed a following [[Prenuptial agreement|marriage contract]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fes.de/archiv/adsd_neu/inhalt/nachlass/nachlass_l/loewenstein-ku.htm source: FES Archiv]&lt;/ref&gt; which is a proof of their progressive thinking and acting concerning [[gender equality]]:

§1 On 1 April 1911 both of the contracties, out of free choice and based on love, agree to found the marriage upon equal rights and responsibilities.

§2 As long as the marriage will last, both contracties and their offspring will use the common name Kerlöw which derives from the marriage.

§3 To legalise the use of this name, state permission should be pursued. If this permission is not given, the contracties promise to use the name in all non administrative areas of life.

§4 To be lawfully wedded both of the contracties will also subject to the state marital contract. However, by a word of honour they declare that the responsibilities and rights, described in the state marital contract will not apply as they find them redundant.

In 1910 he finished his Ph.D thesis on [[Jean-Marie Guyau]]'s pedagogic concepts.

==Politics==
A [[Pacifism|pacifist]], Löwenstein applied to join the [[Red Cross]] in 1914 in [[Grodno]] ([[Belarus]]) where he took care of injured soldiers until 1918. In the meantime he joined ''Soldatenraete'', German Socialist soldier councils, and identified himself as a [[Socialism|Socialist]]. He joined the [[Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (''Unabhängigen Sozialdemokratischen Partei Deutschlands'' - USPD) and became active especially in forming the positions on education and educational politics of the party.

In June 1920 he was elected as a member of the [[Bundestag|National Parliament]] until 1923 as a member of the USPD and from 1923 to 1933 as a Member of the SPD. In September 1920 he was elected an Educational Counselor of Berlin by Election Committee of the City Council. The Brunderburger president denied him of this position in 1920.

From 1921 Löwenstein was responsible for education in the City Council of Berlin – [[Neukölln]]. In this time he organised progressive school tuition fees, providing more school meals for children. He organised special preparation classes for graduation for working class children. Together with [[Fritz Karsen]] they founded the [[Chemnitz|Karl-Marx School]], the first non-religious school in Berlin.

From 1922 to 1934 Löwenstein was Vice-president and one of the co-founders of the [[International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International|Socialist Educational International]] (now the IFM-SEI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifm-sei.org/c/show/24 International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International Official Web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1922 to 1934 he was the president of the International Falcon Movement-Socialist Educational International. From 1924 to 1933 he was the president of German Children's friend movement (ReichsArbeitsGemeinschaft der Kinderfreunde), now the [[Socialist Youth of Germany – Falcons]]. In 1933, when the organisation was forbidden, it united 130,000 children, 10,000 guides and 60,000 parents.

'''Kurt Pahlen'''(May 26, 1907 – July 24, 2003) was an Austrian conductor and musicologist.

== Life ==
Pahlen was born in [[Vienna]], in 1907. At the age of seven, he lost his father, the song accompanist Richard Pahlen. His mother got married for the second time to the banker Paul Raumann and moved to Berlin-[[Schmargendorf]] with him and his son. Kurt Pahlen studied musicology and German studies in his hometown. In addition, he completed an apprenticeship as [[Kapellmeister]] at the [[University of Music and Performing Arts Vienna|Vienna Music Academy]]. In 1929 he received his doctorate.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;[http://www.exilarchiv.de/DE/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2655%3Apahlen-kurt&amp;catid=43&amp;lang=pl Exilarchiv]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his first successes as Kapellmeister of the [[Vienna Volksoper]] and  being appreciated by the {{ill|Revolutionary Socialists of Austria|de|Revolutionäre Sozialisten Österreichs}} as choirmaster, he directed the music events of the Volkshochschule [[Ottakring]]. He was a conductor at [[Radio Wien]] and the [[Vienna Symphony]] and founded an opera studio at Ludo-Hartmann-Platz in the working-class district of Ottakring. Although, according to his own statement he was not personally threatened by [[Nazism]],&lt;ref&gt;See however https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1971-25807-21000-35?cc=2028320&amp;wc=MMGD-23S:n1857874792&lt;/ref&gt; Pahlen did not return in 1938 from a stay in Zürich and emigrated in 1939 to Argentina. In [[Buenos Aires]] he became the music director and head of the Filarmónica Metropolitana, in which also played with the Austrian emigrant Estéban Eitler. Pahlen then became a professor at the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|Universidad de la República]] in [[Montevideo]] and was the founder and holder of the Department of Music History. For many years he was director of [[Teatro Colón]] in Buenos Aires; also taught at the [[Colegio Pestalozzi (Argentina)|Pestalozzi School Buenos Aires.]] In those years he befriended [[Manuel de Falla]], [[Paul Hindemith]], and also from Vienna, [[Erich Wolfgang Korngold]].

After the end of the Third Reich, Pahlen conducted in the [[Vienna State Opera]], the [[Zürich Opera House|Zurich Opera]], [[Theater Basel]], [[Bern Theatre]], [[Badisches Staatstheater Karlsruhe]] and other houses. He has performed with the[[NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra|NDR Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Orchestre de la Suisse Romande]], the [[Mozarteum Orchestra Salzburg]] and other orchestras. In the early 1970s, Pahlen returned to Switzerland and settled in [[Männedorf]]. He was professor at the Internationales Opernstudio of the Zürich Opera House. He taught masterclasses and was president of the Forum for Music and Movement in Lenk. He was [[visiting scholar]] at the [[University of Buenos Aires]],  [[National University of La Plata]], [[Federal University of  Rio de Janeiro]], [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], [[Meritorious Autonomous University of Puebla|Benemérita Universidad Autónoma de Puebla]], [[University of Monterrey]], [[Universidad Veracruzana]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;"Kurt Pahlen", in: Kurt Pahlen: ''Richard Wagner.'' {{full citation needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the {{lang|de|Musiktage}} organized by him for children in [[Lenk im Simmental|Lenk]], he died as a result of a fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/9d4f9ecf50cc7f6dd791f4f80e4616e2|title=Obituaries in the News|work=AP News|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Los Angeles Conservancy''' is a [[historic preservation]] organization in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It works to document, rescue and revitalize [[historic building]]s, places and neighborhoods in the city. The Conservancy is the largest membership based historic preservation organization in the country. The group was formed in 1978 to preserve [[Los Angeles Central Library]], which was threatened with demolition. The organization has over 7000 members and 400 volunteers. There is a volunteer Modern Committee, dedicated to the preservation of [[postwar]] architecture as well as a Historic Theaters Committee that produces the annual "Last Remaining Seats" film series of classic films in the historic [[movie palaces]] in [[downtown Los Angeles]]. The executive director since 1992 has been Linda Dishman. The Conservancy hosts an annual preservation awards ceremony at the [[Millennium Biltmore Hotel]] and works closely with the business, political and development communities to find preservation solutions for historic buildings.

==History of the Service==
[[File:RNLI Exercise 03.jpg|thumb|right|The MVS and RNLI on a joint exercise in Sussex.]]
The MVS was formed on 1 April 1994, a day after the [[Royal Naval Auxiliary Service]] was disbanded.

The RNXS operated small ships such as fleet tenders and inshore minesweepers and ran Naval Control of Shipping centres ashore but was disbanded following the end of the Cold War.

While many of the best aspects of RNXS operating procedures and traditions survive in the MVS, it is emphatically a civilian, but uniformed, charity whose vessels fly a defaced Red Ensign.

However constructive links with the [[Royal Navy]] continue at many levels, including University RN Units.

There are many ex-RN members in the MVS, and more are always welcome.

Over the years MVS volunteers have achieved much.

Among the many occasions when they made a difference was during the MSC Napoli salvage when the MVS played a significant role ashore and afloat and was commended by the then SOSREP, Robin Middleton.

More recently the MVS had a supporting role during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].

Its London Units were involved in an extended deployment as part of the Environment Agency's security operation for the Olympic Rowing and Kayak Sprint events held at Eton Dorney Lake.

The City of London Unit's Nelson 45 launch, Londinium 1 and three RIBs were based at Boveney Lock on the Non-tidal Thames for two weeks.

The MVS craft had the privilege of being invited to take part in celebratory processions for Team GB's many gold medal winners down the river, from the Olympic Venue to Team GB's riverside hotel.

The MVS also assisted Weymouth Harbour Authority during the Olympics.

Poole Unit's ex-Customs launch Avocet, and RIBS from Portsmouth, Christchurch, Bournemouth, Weymouth and Portland Units worked to the Weymouth Harbour Master's instructions, patrolling the port's busy anchorages and approaches.

The MVS's national training vessel East Sussex 1 sailed to Weymouth to act as a floating hotel and control centre for the crews of the other craft.

The MVS's work supporting the Olympics was one of the major factors that led to it receiving the Queen's Diamond Jubilee Volunteering Award 2012.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvs.org.uk/queens-diamond-jubilee-volunteering-award-2012 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141213015440/http://www.mvs.org.uk/queens-diamond-jubilee-volunteering-award-2012 |archivedate=13 December 2014 |df= }} Maritime Volunteer Services recognised at St. James Palace&lt;/ref&gt;

The Maritime Volunteer Service has around 400 members in 27 units around the United Kingdom.

Most units meet weekly for training, which is put into practice afloat using a range of craft including RIBs, launches, dories, and the national training vessel East Sussex 1.

The MVS maintains strong links with local authorities, harbour boards and other maritime organisations.

In 2014 the MVS marked its 20th Anniversary at an official dinner in Portsmouth, where the guest of honour was Vice-Admiral Sir Alan Massey KCB, CBE, RN Chief Executive of the MCA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mvs.org.uk/news/mvs-20th-anniversary-speech-sir-alan-massey |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119183432/http://www.mvs.org.uk/news/mvs-20th-anniversary-speech-sir-alan-massey |archivedate=19 January 2015 |df= }} MCA Chief Executive guest of honour at MVS 20th Anniversary Dinner&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
On 7 May 1997, the then Armed Forces Minister, Dr John Reid, announced during a visit to the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth that the Royal Navy would give formal recognition to the Maritime Volunteer Service.

In his remarks, he said that the Royal Navy's recognition is a tribute to the important role that the MVS play in the education and training of young people in nautical skills. 
&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199798/ldhansrd/vo980507/text/80507w04.htm Formal Recognition], publications.parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016 the First Sea Lord Admiral Sir Philip Jones KCB ADC issued a new Defence Instruction and Notice again recognising the MVS.

==The Defaced Ensign==
[[File:0005 Defaced Red Ensign.jpg|thumb|right|The MVS Defaced Ensign]]
On 2 September 1998, a Warrant was issued giving permission for the MVS to wear a Red Ensign bearing the Service's "V" and "Anchor" logo and naval crown.

The logo was designed by Commander Bruce Nicholls OBE RN, and this is only the thirty-fifth designed Red Ensign approved for use worldwide.

Of that total six are flown by UK public institutions such as Trinity House, the RNLI and the Scout Association, six by dependent territories and five by Commonwealth countries and provinces.

The remainder have been granted to privileged yacht clubs around the world.

The MVS Ensign accurately reflects the Service's aims in promoting maritime skills amongst local communities in ports and harbours around Britain's coast.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.crwflags.com/fotw/flags/gb~mvs.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims &amp; Objectives==
The MVS objects are:

To advance the education and training of the members of the charity and the general public in all aspects of maritime and communication skills and knowledge.

The protection and preservation of life and property primarily, but not exclusively, within the maritime environment.

==Training==
Each member is issued an individual training log book and members can train in variety of RYA courses including:

•	RYA Basic Navigation and Safety Course

•	RYA Day Skipper Theory Course

•	RYA Coastal Skipper / Yachtmaster Offshore Theory Course

•	RYA Diesel Engine Course

•	RYA Marine Radio Short Range Certificate Course

•	RYA First Aid

Members can also train with materials produced by the MVS covering:

•	Safety at Sea

•	Operation of Inboard and Outboard Motors

•	Boat Handling

•	Vessel Repair and Maintenance

•	Chart Work and Navigation including use of navigation equipment

•	Emergency Response such as pollution, incidents and afloat patrols

'''Marketing science''' is a field that approaches [[marketing]]&amp;nbsp;– the understanding of customer needs, and the development of approaches by which they might be fulfilled&amp;nbsp;– predominantly through  [[scientific method]]s, rather than through tools and techniques common with research in [[the arts]] or in [[humanities]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://greenbookblog.org/2016/07/14/what-does-marketing-science-bring-to-the-table/|title=What Exactly Is Marketing Science?|work=GreenBook|access-date=2018-02-21|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The field of marketing science, in the pursuit of "truths" in marketing, is related to, but more general than [[marketing research]], which is oriented towards a specific product, service or campaign.

Before marketing science was formally labeled, its activity appeared as [[management science]] within the [[marketing]] framework.&lt;ref&gt;David B. Montgomery 2001. "Management Science in Marketing: Prehistory, Origin, and Early Years of the INFORMS Marketing College." Marketing Science 20 (4): 337–348. {{doi|10.1287/mksc.20.4.337.9762}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The interaction between academics and practitioners in marketing science dates back to 1961, with the founding of the [[Marketing Science Institute]]. Interest in marketing science as a field grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s as electronic [[point-of-sale]] data grew and  [[barcode reader]]s led to a "marketing information revolution." &lt;ref&gt;Robert C. Blattberg, Rashi Glazer, and John D.C. Little, eds. 1994. The Marketing Information Revolution. Boston Mass.: Harvard Business School Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before conferences were organized with a "marketing science" label, four meetings were convened as "Market Measurement and Analysis" conferences from 1979 to 1982, sponsored by [[The Institute of Management Sciences]] and the [[Operations Research Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;Dick R. Wittink 2001. "Market Measurement and Analysis: The First ‘Marketing Science’ Conference." Marketing Science 20 (4): 349–356. {{doi|10.1287/mksc.20.4.349.9758}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The first officially labeled Marketing Science Conference was hosted by the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|School of Management at UCLA]] in 1983.

== Marketing science and Big Data ==
The marketing profession has long relied on data. But as the [[data flood]] gets bigger, progressive marketers are turning to [[big data]] analysis methods as well as systematic observation, testing and measurement to study broad [[behavioral pattern]]s, [[drill down]] from the [[Data aggregation|aggregate]] to the individual and produce new insights that improve business outcomes.

[[File:Max-Planck-Institut.jpg|thumbnail|Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law]]
The '''Max Planck Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law''' ({{lang-de|Max-Planck-Institut für ausländisches und internationales Strafrecht}}) is a non-university research institute located in [[Freiburg im Breisgau|Freiburg]], [[Germany]]. The institute is part of the [[Max Planck Society]] and is conducting basic research into [[criminal law]] and [[criminology]].

The Institute is currently headed by [[Hans-Jörg Albrecht]] (criminology) and [[Ulrich Sieber]] (criminal law). In 2006, the Institute had a total of 149 employees, including 30 researchers and 51 young researchers, as well as 20 third-party employees and 41 visiting researchers. The library comprises more than 400,000 titles and is one of the largest libraries in the area. A former director is [[Albin Eser]].

== History ==
The history of the Institute dates back to 1938, when by [[Adolf Schönke]] held the "Seminar for Foreign and International Criminal Law" at the [[Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg]]. This led to the founding of the "Institute for Foreign and International Criminal Law" in 1947. The Institute was renamed in 1966, when it joined the Max Planck Society.

{{Atheism and Irreligion Sidebar}}
'''Metaphysical naturalism''' (also called '''ontological naturalism''', '''philosophical naturalism''', '''scientific materialism''' and '''antisupernaturalism''') is a philosophical worldview, which holds that there is nothing but [[natural]] elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]].  [[Methodological naturalism]] is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible [[ontology|ontological]] foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or [[spiritual naturalism]]. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].

==Definition==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], geologist and president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that; 1. Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]]; and 2. Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]]. Non-physical or quasi-physical [[substance (philosophy)|substance]], such as [[information]], [[idea]]s, [[values]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[intellect]], and other [[emergentism|emergent phenomena]], either [[supervenience|supervene]] upon the physical or can be [[eliminative materialism|reduced]] to a physical account; and 3. Nature operates by the laws of [[physics]] and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; and 4. the [[supernatural]] does not exist, i.e., only nature is [[reality|real]].  [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is therefore a [[metaphysical]] philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

[[Carl Sagan]] put it succinctly: "The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur C. Danto]], naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the vagueness of the general term "naturalism", [[David Papineau]] traces the current usage to philosophers in early 20th century America such as [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]: "So understood, 'naturalism' is not a particularly informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized—that is, they would both reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}} Papineau remarks that philosophers widely regard naturalism as a "positive" term, and "few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists'", while noting that "philosophers concerned with religion tend to be less enthusiastic about 'naturalism'" and that despite an "inevitable" divergence due to its popularity, if more narrowly construed, (to the chagrin of [[John McDowell]], [[David Chalmers]] and [[Jennifer Hornsby]], for example), those not so disqualified remain nonetheless content "to set the bar for 'naturalism' higher".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}}

Philosopher and theologian [[Alvin Plantinga]], a [[evolutionary argument against naturalism|well-known critic of naturalism]] in general, comments: "Naturalism is presumably not a religion. In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: it can be said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological naturalism===

Metaphysical naturalism is an approach to [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], which deals with existence ''per se''. It should not be confused with [[methodological naturalism]], which sees [[empiricism]] as the basis for the scientific method.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Regarding science and evolution, [[Eugenie C. Scott]], a notable opponent of teaching [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] in US public schools, stresses the importance of separating metaphysical from methodological naturalism:
{{quote|If it is important for Americans to learn about science and evolution, decoupling the two forms of naturalism is essential strategy. ... I suggest that scientists can defuse some of the opposition to evolution by first recognizing that the vast majority of Americans are believers, and that most Americans want to retain their faith. It is demonstrable that individuals can retain religious beliefs and still accept evolution as science. Scientists should avoid confusing the methodological naturalism of science with metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"/&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|"Creationism, Ideology, and Science"}}

===Lack of necessity for worship===

The historian [[Richard Carrier]], in his book ''Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism,'' describes metaphysical naturalism thus: as a philosophy "wherein worship is replaced with curiosity, devotion with diligence, holiness with sincerity, ritual with study, and scripture with the whole world and the whole of human learning". Carrier wrote that it is the naturalist’s duty "to question all things and have a well-grounded faith in what is well-investigated and well-proved, rather than what is merely well-asserted or well-liked".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and naturalism==
{{main article|Uniformitarianism}}
Metaphysical naturalism is the philosophical basis of science as described by Kate and Vitaly (2000) "There are certain philosophical assumptions made at the base of the scientific method — namely, 1) that reality is objective and consistent, 2) that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that 3) rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded. Philosophy is at least implicitly at the core of every decision we make or position we take, it is obvious that correct philosophy is a necessity for scientific inquiry to take place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|A.Sergei|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Schafersman]], agrees that methodological naturalism is "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching [[Creationism]] or [[Intelligent Design]] in US public schools such as [[Eugenie Scott]], Schafersman asserts that "while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} as well as the similarly controversial assertion: "I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} On the other hand, Scott argues:
{{quote|that a clear distinction must be drawn between science as a way of knowing about the natural world and science as a foundation for philosophical views. One should be taught to our children in school, and the other can optionally be taught to our children at home. Once this view is explained, I have found far more support than disagreement among my university colleagues. Even someone who may disagree with my logic or understanding of philosophy of science often understands the strategic reasons for separating methodological from philosophical [[materialism]]—if we want more Americans to understand evolution.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=1996 |chapter="Creationism, Ideology, and Science" |title=The Flight From Science and Reason |publisher=The New York Academy of Sciences, |pages=519–520 |editors=Gross, Levitt, and Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=2008 |url=http://ncse.com/religion/science-religion-methodology-humanism |title=Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism |publisher=NCSE |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism}} However, there are other controversies, [[Arthur Newell Strahler]] embeds peculiar [[anthropic principle|anthropic]] distinctions in the name of naturalism: "The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Strahler|1992|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variously known as [[background independence]], the [[cosmological principle]], the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or [[uniformitarianism]], there ''are'' important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around. You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the out crop of rock."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1987|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way "prove" the validity of induction—an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1965|pp=223–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's "uniformity of process" are an assumption: "As such, it is another ''a priori'' assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1984|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to R. Hooykaas: "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts ... It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooykaas|1963|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various associated beliefs==
Contemporary naturalists possess a wide diversity of beliefs within metaphysical naturalism.  Most metaphysical naturalists have adopted some form of [[materialism]] or [[physicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Certainly most philosophical naturalists today are materialists[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undesigned universe===
Metaphysical naturalists argue that the scientific facts and theories that we have to explain the origins of the universe provide no evidence for supernatural beings or deities.&lt;ref name=sag&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard |last= Carrier |title= Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism |date= 2010-08-09 |publisher= AuthorHouse |location= Bloomington, Indiana |section= Free Preview |accessdate= 2013-12-25 |url=http://bookstore.authorhouse.com/Products/SKU-000406158/Sense-and-Goodness-Without-God.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Richard Carrier explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...no other worldview is directly and substantially supported by any scientific evidence, whereas all scientific evidence so far does support Metaphysical Naturalism, often directly, sometimes substantially. Though naturalism has not yet been proved, it is the best bet going.&lt;ref name=sag/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One might say that either it has always existed or it had a purely natural origin, being neither created nor designed.

===Abiogenesis and evolution===
Since nature is all there is, and there was once no life, abiogenesis is implied: that life arose spontaneously from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=166–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Carrier, [The Argument from Biogenesis: Probabilities Against a Natural Origin of Life],  ''Biology and Philosophy'' 19.5 (November 2004), pp. 739-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists reason about ''how'', not ''if'' evolution happened.  They maintain that humanity's existence is not by [[intelligent design]] but rather a natural process of [[emergence]].

===Ethics and meta-ethics===

Some embrace [[virtue ethics]] and many see no compelling argument against [[ethical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=168–176, 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2012}}  Some may advocate for a [[Science of morality]].  One example of an attempt to ground a naturalist meta-ethical system is [[Richard Carrier]]'s chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" which was peer reviewed by four philosophers.  It sets out to prove a [[Moral realism]] centered around human satisfaction.  [[Alexander Rosenberg]] has expressed a contrary position that naturalists, in general, have to accept [[moral nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Alexander |title=The Disenchanted Naturalist’s Guide to Reality |url=http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |work=On the Human Forum |publisher=National Humanities Center (United States) |authorlink=Alexander Rosenberg |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226150034/http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The mind is a natural phenomenon===

If any variety of metaphysical naturalism is true, any [[mental properties]] that exist are [[causality|caused]] by and [[ontology|ontologically]] dependent upon nature.

Metaphysical naturalists do not believe in a [[soul]] or [[spirit]], nor in [[ghost]]s, and when explaining what constitutes the [[mind]] they rarely appeal to [[substance dualism]]. If one's mind, or rather one's [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and existence as a [[person]], is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as [[idea]]s, [[theories]], [[emotions]], moral and personal [[values]], or [[aesthetic]] response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.&lt;ref name="stace3"&gt;Stace, W.T, Mysticism and Philosophy. N.Y.: Macmillan, 1960; reprinted, Los Angeles: Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility of reason===
Metaphysical naturalists hold that [[reason]] is the refinement and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of [[pure reason]] alone can securely discover logical errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value of society===
Humans are [[social animals]], which is why humanity developed [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In terms of evolution, this means that differential reproductive success somehow depended on traits that permit the development and maintenance of a healthy and productive culture and civilization.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

==History&lt;!--'History of metaphysical naturalism' redirects here--&gt;==
{{also|History of materialism|History of metaphysical realism}}
===Ancient and medieval philosophy===
Naturalism was the foundation of two ([[Vaisheshika]], [[Nyaya]]) of the six orthodox schools and one ([[Carvaka]]) heterodox school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;A Chatterjee (2012), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/naturalism-india/ Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), ''Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass'', {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pp. 227–246&lt;/ref&gt; The Carvaka, Nyaya, Vaisheshika schools originated in the 7th, 6th, and 2nd century BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (1999), ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Western metaphysical naturalism has originated in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. The earliest [[pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, especially the [[Milesian school|Milesians]] ([[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]) and the [[atomists]] ([[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]]), were labeled by their peers and successors "the ''physikoi''" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φυσικός or ''physikos'', meaning "natural philosopher," borrowing on the word φύσις or ''[[physis]]'', meaning "nature") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as [[Epicureanism]], which sought to explain everything that exists as the product of atoms falling and swerving in a [[Void (philosophy)|void]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', books I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine [[Demiurge|Artisan]], contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic ''[[Weltanschauungen]]'', of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]… while the [[Stoics]] adopted a [[Teleological argument|divine teleology]]…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system. This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters. [[Cicero]]… preserves Aristotle's own [[Allegory of the cave|cave-image]]: if [[Troglodytae|troglodytes]] were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged. But Aristotle grew to abandon this view; although he believes in a divine being, the [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] is not the [[efficient cause]] of action in the Universe, and plays no part in constructing or arranging it... But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces. Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or ''[[phusis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the rise and dominance of [[Christianity]] in the West and the later spread of [[Islam]], metaphysical naturalism was generally abandoned by intellectuals. Thus, there is little evidence for it in [[medieval philosophy]]. The reintroduction of Aristotle's empirical epistemology as well as previously lost treatises by Greco-Roman natural philosophers which was begun by the medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] without resulting in any noticeable increase in commitment to naturalism.

===Modern philosophy===
It was not until the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern era of philosophy]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that naturalists like [[Benedict Spinoza]] (who put forward a theory of [[psychophysical parallelism]]), [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the proponents of [[French materialism]] (notably [[Denis Diderot]], [[Julien La Mettrie]], and [[Baron d'Holbach]]) started to emerge again in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this period, some metaphysical naturalists adhered to a distinct doctrine, [[materialism]], which became the dominant category of metaphysical naturalism widely defended until the end of the 19th century.

[[Immanuel Kant]] rejected ([[reductionist]]) materialist positions in metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not hostile to naturalism. His [[transcendental philosophy]] is considered to be a form of [[liberal naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', a form of [[natural philosophy]], was developed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]](2002), ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801'', Harvard university Press, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; as an attempt to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen after Hegel was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]],&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s [[dialectical materialism]], especially Engels's dialectical philosophy of nature (''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'').

Another notable school of late modern philosophy advocating naturalism was [[German materialism]]: members included [[Ludwig Büchner]], [[Jacob Moleschott]], and [[Karl Vogt]].&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, ''The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 165: "During the 1850s German ... scientists conducted a controversy known ... as the materialistic controversy. It was specially associated with the names of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner" and p. 173: "Frenchmen were surprised to see Büchner and Vogt. ... [T]he French were surprised at German materialism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nineteenth Century and After]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-VXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q= Vol. 151], 1952, p. 227: "the Continental materialism of Moleschott and Buchner&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary philosophy===
In the early 20th century, [[matter]] was found to be a form of [[energy]] and therefore not fundamental as materialists had assumed. (See [[History of physics]].) In [[contemporary philosophy]], renewed attention to the [[problem of universals]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], the development of [[mathematical logic]], and the post-[[logical positivism|positivist]] revival of [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]], initially by way of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] [[linguistic philosophy]], further called the naturalistic paradigm into question. Developments such as these, along with those within science and the [[philosophy of science]] brought new advancements and revisions of naturalistic doctrines by naturalistic philosophers into metaphysics, [[ethics]], the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], etc., the products of which include [[physicalism]] and [[eliminative materialism]], [[supervenience]], [[causal theory of reference|causal theories of reference]], [[anomalous monism]], [[naturalized epistemology]] (e.g. [[reliabilism]]), [[internalism and externalism]], [[ethical naturalism]], and [[property dualism]], for example.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen in contemporary philosophy is [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Objectivism is an expression of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[ethical idealism]] within a naturalistic framework.

The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the middle of the twentieth century, the acceptance of the causal closure of the physical realm led to even stronger naturalist views. The [[causal closure]] thesis implies that any mental and biological causes must themselves be physically constituted, if they are to produce physical effects. It thus gives rise to a particularly strong form of ontological naturalism, namely the physicalist doctrine that any state that has physical effects must itself be physical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 1950s onwards, philosophers began to formulate arguments for ontological physicalism. Some of these arguments appealed explicitly to the causal closure of the physical realm (Feigl 1958, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958). In other cases, the reliance on causal closure lay below the surface. However, it is not hard to see that even in these latter cases the causal closure thesis played a crucial role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Papineau |first=David |authorlink=David Papineau |year=2007 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2007/entries/naturalism/#NatPhy |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor=Edward N.

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], an advocacy group opposing [[creationism]] in public schools,&lt;ref name="Williams 2"&gt;{{cite news |title=The God curriculum  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/smcreate07.xml&amp;page=2 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |location=London |first=Sally |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism—and later of metaphysical naturalism—followed the advances of science and the increase of its [[explanatory power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism did not exist as a philosophy before the nineteenth century, but only as an occasionally adopted and non-rigorous method among natural philosophers. It is a unique philosophy in that it is not ancient or prior to science, and that it developed largely due to the influence of science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism is almost unique in that it would not exist as a philosophy without the prior existence of science. It shares this status, in my view, with the philosophy of existentialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical naturalism==

In the context of creation and evolution debates, [[Internet Infidels]] co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder argues against what he calls "the argument from bias", that ''a priori,'' the supernatural is merely ruled out due to an unexamined stipulation. Lowder believes "there are good empirical reasons for believing that metaphysical naturalism is true, and therefore a denial of the supernatural need not be based upon an ''a priori'' assumption".&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"/&gt;

Richard Carrier argues in ''Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism'' that Metaphysical Naturalism is true. Topics covered include [[metaphilosophy]],  [[semantics]], [[epistemology]], the nature and [[origin of the universe]] (including a proposal that [[spacetime]] may be the [[ground of all being]] and [[brute fact|a rejection of the logical possibility for any ultimate answer]]),  free will [[compatibilism]], the nature of [[mind]], [[abstract objects]], [[Reductionism#Ontological reductionism|ontological reductionism]], the nature of [[emotions]], the [[meaning of life]], the nature of [[reason]], [[atheism]], [[aesthetics]], [[morality]] (including [[ethical naturalism]] and a recommendation for a [[science of morality]]), and [[politics]].

===Argument from physical minds===

Several Metaphysical Naturalists have used the trends in scientific discoveries about minds to argue that no supernatural minds exist.  For instance, Lowder says, "Since all known mental activity has a physical basis, there are probably no disembodied minds. But God is conceived of as a disembodied mind. Therefore, God probably does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/minds.html |title=Argument from Physical Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowder argues the correlation between mind and brain implies that supernatural souls do not exist because the theist position, according to Lowder, is that the mind depends upon this soul instead of the brain.&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/infidels/newsletter/1999/march.html#Naturalism |date=March 1999 |work=Internet Infidels Newsletter |title=The Empirical Case for Metaphysical Naturalism |first=Jeffery Jay |last=Lowder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological argument for naturalism===

{{quote|[Elegance] goes directly to the question of how the laws of nature are constructed. Nobody knows the answer to that. Nobody! It's a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, in my view, to say that some extremely elegant creator made those laws. But I think if you go down that road, you must have the courage to ask the next question, which is: Where did that creator come from? And where did his, her, or its elegance come from? And if you say it was always there, then why not say that the laws of nature were always there and save a step?&lt;ref name="Sagan2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Sagan |first2=T. |last2=Head |year=2006 |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |series=Literary Conversations Series |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=9781578067367 |lccn=2005048747 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&amp;pg=PR14 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Carl Sagan]]|''Conversations with Carl Sagan''}}

==Arguments against==

Arguments against metaphysical naturalism include the following examples.

===Evolutionary argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}
[[Alvin Plantinga]] is the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy at Calvin College. He is a [[Christian]], and a well-known critic of naturalism.  He argues, in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], that the probability that evolution has produced humans with [[Reliabilism|reliable true beliefs]], is low or inscrutable, unless their evolution was guided, for example, by God.  According to David Kahan of the [[University of Glasgow]], in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of [[supernatural]] theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |title=Gifford Lecture Series - Warrant and Proper Function 1987-1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104024641/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ |title=Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers — Letters to the Editor |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=11 April 2010 |quote=...I do indeed think that evolution functions as a contemporary shibboleth by which to distinguish the ignorant fundamentalist goats from the informed and scientifically literate sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, 'It is absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).' Daniel Dennett goes Dawkins one (or two) further: 'Anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant.' You wake up in the middle of the night; you think, can that whole Darwinian story really be true? Wham! You are inexcusably ignorant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do think that evolution has become a modern idol of the tribe. But of course it doesn't even begin to follow that I think the scientific theory of evolution is false. And I don't.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |title=Warrant and Proper Function |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507863-2 |at=Chap. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[supernormal stimuli]]).''

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[evil demon]] or [[brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.K. |last=Beilby |year=2002 |chapter=Introduction by Alvin Plantinga |title=Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism |series=Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-8763-7 |lccn=2001006111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p40tc_T7-rMC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1–2, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Take ''philosophical naturalism'' to be the belief that there aren't any supernatural entities—no such person as God, for example, but also no other supernatural entities, and nothing at all like God. My claim was that naturalism and contemporary evolutionary theory are at serious odds with one another—and this despite the fact that the latter is ordinarily thought to be one of the main pillars supporting the edifice of the former. (Of course I am ''not'' attacking the theory of evolution, or anything in that neighborhood; I am instead attacking the conjunction of ''naturalism'' with the view that human beings have evolved in that way. I see no similar problems with the conjunction of ''theism'' and the idea that human beings have evolved in the way contemporary evolutionary science suggests.) More particularly, I argued that the conjunction of naturalism with the belief that we human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine... is in a certain interesting way self-defeating or self-referentially incoherent.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"/&gt;|Alvin Plantinga|"Introduction" in ''Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism''}}

Branden Fitelson of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] argue that Plantinga must show that the combination of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that "at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true", and that defects such as [[cognitive bias]] are nonetheless consistent with being made in the image of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's [[hyperbolic doubt]] is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: "[neither] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by [[philosophy of mind|philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]] and historian [[Richard Carrier]] who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antinominalist argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Theory of Forms|Hylomorphism|Scholasticism}}
[[Edward Feser]], in his 2008 book ''The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism'', lays a plenary case against naturalism by re-examining pre-Modern philosophy. Beginning in the second chapter, Feser cites the [[Plato]]nic&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 31-49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 2, pp. 53-72&lt;/ref&gt; answers to the [[problem of universals]]—that is, [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Feser also offers arguments against [[nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; And by defending realism and rejecting nominalism, he rejects [[eliminative materialism]]—and thus naturalism.

In the third chapter, Feser summarizes three of [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas's]] arguments for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 90-119&lt;/ref&gt; These include arguments for an unmoved mover,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 91-102&lt;/ref&gt; first, uncaused cause &lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 102-110&lt;/ref&gt; and (supernatural) supreme intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-118&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that these must exist not as a matter of probability—as in the [[intelligent design]] view, particularly of [[irreducible complexity]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-114&lt;/ref&gt;—but as a necessary consequence of "obvious, though empirical, starting points".&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Metapsychology''' ([[Greek language|Greek]]: ''meta'' 'beyond, transcending', and ''ψυχολογία'' '[[psychology]]')&lt;ref name=OMD&gt;[https://archive.is/20070813174048/http://cancerweb.ncl.ac.uk/cgi-bin/omd?metapsychology Metapsychology Online Medical Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; is that aspect of any psychological theory which refers to the structure of the theory itself (hence the prefix "meta") rather than to the entity it describes. The psychology is about the psyche; the metapsychology is about the psychology. The term is used mostly in discourse about psychoanalysis, the psychology developed by [[Sigmund Freud]], which today is regarded as a branch of science (with roots in the work of Freud's scientific mentors and predecessors, especially Helmholtz, Brucke, Charcot, and Janet) and/or a hermeneutics of understanding (with roots in Freud's literary sources, especially Sophocles and, to a lesser extent, Goethe and Shakespeare).  Emphasis on the scientific status of psychoanalysis has been renewed in the emerging discipline of neuropsychoanalysis, whose major exemplar is Mark Solms. The hermeneutic vision of psychoanalysis is the focus of influential works by Donna Orange.

On March 10, 1898, he wrote to Fiess: "It seems to me that ({{lang-de|als ob}})&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite book |last=Roudinesco |first=Élisabeth |authorlink=Élisabeth Roudinesco |last2=Plon |first2=Michel |title=Wörterbuch der Psychoanalyse.

A salient example of Freud's own metapsychology is his chracterization of psychoanalysis as a "simultaneously closed system, fundamentally unrelated and impervious to the external world and as an open system inherently connected and responsive to environmental influence''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dunn |first=Jonathan |title=The foundational wisdom in Freud's and Loewald's metapsychologies |journal=Modern Psychoanalysis |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |pages=2–25 |publisher=Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies |url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/6559b62f61964d350d95da9f488c482a/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=36244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s, Freud wrote a series of twelve essays, to be collected as ''Preliminaries to a Metapsychology''. Five of these were published independently under the titles: "Instincts and Their Vicissitudes," "Repression," "The Unconscious," "A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams," and "Mourning and Melancholia." The remaining seven remained unpublished, an expression of Freud's ambivalence about his own attempts to articulate the whole of his vision of psychoanalysis.  In 1919 he wrote to [[Lou Andreas-Salome]], "Where is my Metapsychology? In the first place it remains unwritten".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Freud |first=Sigmund |authorlink=Sigmund Freud |title=On metapsychology: the theory of psychoanalysis |page=102 |publisher=The Penguin Freud Library |volume=11 |location=London |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-140-13801-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1920 he published ''[[Beyond the Pleasure Principle]]'', a text with metaphysical ambitions.

'''''Oedipus Judaicus''''' by [[William Drummond of Logiealmond|William Drummond]] was first published in 1811 in a limited edition of 200 copies. The book was originally intended for use in a scholastic setting in an attempt to protect Drummond's political career from ridicule.

The work is a commentary on a supposed [[astrological allegory]] in the [[Old Testament]] of the Bible, patterned after the ''[[Oedipus Aegyptiacus]]'' of [[Athanasius Kircher|Kircher]]. In the book, Drummond seeks possible sources of the Biblical writings, from the [[Dendera temple complex|Temple of Denderah]] to parallels with the [[Roman mythology|Roman god]]s, dealing primarily with the [[s:Bible (King James)/Genesis#Chapter 49|49th chapter]] of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and the [[book of Joshua]] to draw his conclusions.

The book was reprinted in 1866 and again in 1986, and is again in print.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3402">'''Ohio Public Interest Research Group''' ('''Ohio PIRG''') is a [[non-profit organization]] that is part of the state [[Public Interest Research Groups|PIRG]] organizations. It works on a variety of political activities. 

In the United States, Public Interest Research Groups (PIRGs) are [[non-profit organization]]s that employ [[grassroots]] organizing, direct advocacy, [[investigative journalism]], and [[Law suit|litigation]] to affect public policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=U.S. PIRG: About Us |url=http://www.uspirg.org/page/usp/about-us |accessdate=October 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==

Ohio PIRG's mission is to deliver persistent, result-oriented public interest activism that protects our environment, encourages a fair, sustainable economy, and fosters responsive, democratic government.&lt;ref name="Project Vote Smart"&gt;{{cite web |publisher= Project Vote Smart |url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/826/ohio-public-interest-research-group#.UoEDluI7eNM |title=Ohio PIRG"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The PIRGs emerged in the early 1970s on U.S. [[college]] campuses. The PIRG model was proposed in the book ''[[Action for a Change]]'' by [[Ralph Nader]] and [[Donald K. Ross (author)|Donald Ross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nader|first=Ralph|title=Action for a Change: A Student's Manual for Public Interest Organizing|year=1972|publisher=Grossman Publishers|location=New York|author2=Donald Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Among other early accomplishments, the PIRGs were responsible for much of the [[Container deposit legislation#United States|Container Container Deposit Legislation in the United States]], also known as "bottle bills."&lt;ref name="Boston College, The Heights, Volume LVI, Number 4, 22 September 1975"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Boston College]] |url=http://newspapers.bc.edu/cgi-bin/bostonsh?a=d&amp;d=bcheights19750922.2.30|title=PIRG Backs "Bottle Bill"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Sun Sentinel"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Sun Sentinel]] |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1991-11-08/news/9102150529_1_bottle-bill-beverage-containers-industry-recycling-program|title=Bottle Bill Beverage Containers Recycling Program"|accessdate=2013-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Orrmulum.jpg|thumb|A page from the ''Ormulum'' demonstrating the editing performed over time by Orm ([[#Parkes1983|Parkes 1983]], pp. 115–16), as well as the insertions of new readings by "Hand B".]]

The '''''Ormulum''''' or '''''Orrmulum''''' is a twelfth-century work of biblical [[exegesis]], written by a monk named Orm (or Ormin) and consisting of just under 19,000 lines of early [[Middle English]] verse. Because of the unique [[phonetics|phonetic]] [[orthography]] adopted by its author, the work preserves many details of English pronunciation existing at a time when the language was in flux after the [[Norman conquest of England]]. Consequently, it is invaluable to [[philology|philologists]] and [[historical linguistics|historical linguists]] in tracing the development of the language.

After a preface and dedication, the work consists of [[Homily|homilies]] explicating the biblical texts set for the mass throughout the [[liturgical year]]. It was intended to be consulted as the texts changed, and is agreed to be tedious and repetitive when read straight through.  Only about a fifth of the promised material is in the single manuscript of the work to survive, which is in the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford.

Orm was concerned with priests' ability to speak the [[vernacular]], and developed an idiosyncratic spelling system to guide his readers in the pronunciation of the vowels. He used a strict [[Metre (poetry)|poetic metre]] to ensure that readers know which syllables are to be stressed. Modern scholars use these two features to reconstruct Middle English as Orm spoke it ([[#Burchfield1987|Burchfield 1987]], p.&amp;nbsp;280).

==Origins==
Unusually for work of the period, the ''Ormulum'' is neither anonymous nor untitled. The author names himself at the end of the dedication:
:{| cellpadding="8"
| {{lang|enm|Icc was þær þær i crisstnedd was}}&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; {{lang|enm|Orrmin bi name nemmnedd}}
| Where I was christened, I was&lt;br /&gt; named Ormin by name
| &lt;br /&gt;{{small|(Ded. 323–24)}}
|}
At the start of the preface, the author identifies himself again, using a different spelling of his name, and gives the work a title:
:{| cellpadding="8"
| {{lang|enm|Þiss boc iss nemmnedd Orrmulum}}&lt;br /&gt; &amp;nbsp; {{lang|enm|forrþi þatt Orrm itt wrohhte}}
| This book is named Ormulum,&lt;br /&gt; for Orm wrought [created] it
| &lt;br /&gt;{{small|(Pref. 1–2)}}{{Ref label|notabene_A|A|none}}
|}

The name "Orm" derives from [[Old Norse]], meaning ''worm'', ''serpent'' or ''dragon''. With the suffix of "myn" for "man" (hence "Ormin"), it was a common name throughout the [[Danelaw]] area of England. The meter probably dictated the choice between each of the two forms of the name. The title of the poem, "Ormulum", is modeled after the [[Latin language|Latin]] word ''speculum'' ("mirror") ([[#Matthew2004|Matthew 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;936), so popular in the title of medieval Latin non-fiction works that the term [[speculum literature]] is used for the genre.

The Danish name is not unexpected; the language of the ''Ormulum'', an East Midlands dialect, is stringently of the Danelaw ([[#Bennett1982|Bennett and Smithers 1982]], pp.&amp;nbsp;174–75). It includes numerous Old Norse phrases (particularly doublets, where an English and Old Norse term are co-joined), but there are very few [[Old French]] influences on Orm's language ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;33). Another—likely previous—East Midlands work, the ''[[Peterborough Chronicle]]'', shows a great deal of French influence. The linguistic contrast between it and the work of Orm demonstrates both the sluggishness of the Norman influence in the formerly Danish areas of England and the assimilation of Old Norse features into early Middle English ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], pp.&amp;nbsp;259–63).

[[File:BourneAbbeyInterior.jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the church of [[Bourne Abbey]], where the ''Ormulum'' was composed: the two nave arcades, although now [[whitewash]]ed, remain from the church Orm would have known.]]
According to the work's dedication, Orm wrote it at the behest of Brother Walter, who was his brother both ''{{lang|enm|affterr þe flæshess kinde}}'' (biologically) and as a fellow [[canon (priest)|canon]] of an [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] order ([[#Matthew2004|Matthew 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;936). With this information, and the evidence of the dialect of the text, it is possible to propose a place of origin with reasonable certainty. While some scholars, among them Henry Bradley, have regarded the likely origin as [[Elsham Priory]] in north Lincolnshire ([[#Bennett1982|Bennett and Smithers 1982]], pp.&amp;nbsp;174–75), as of the mid-1990s it became widely accepted that Orm wrote in the [[Bourne Abbey]] in [[Bourne, Lincolnshire]] ([[#Treharne2000|Treharne 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;273). Two additional pieces of evidence support this conjecture: firstly, Arrouaisian canons established the abbey in 1138, and secondly, the work includes dedicatory prayers to [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]], the patrons of Bourne Abbey ([[#Parkes1983|Parkes 1983]], pp.&amp;nbsp;115–27). The Arrouaisian rule was largely that of Augustine, so that its houses often are loosely referred to as [[Augustinians|Augustinian]] (Jack, George, in [[#Matthew2004|Matthew and Harrison 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;936–37; [[#Parkes1983|Parkes 1983]], pp.&amp;nbsp;115–27).

Scholars cannot pinpoint the exact date of composition. Orm wrote his book over a period of decades and the manuscript shows signs of multiple corrections through time ([[#Burchfield1987|Burchfield 1987]], p.&amp;nbsp;280). Since it is apparently an autograph, with two of the three hands in the text generally believed by scholars to be Orm's own, the date of the manuscript and the date of composition would have been the same. On the evidence of the third hand (that of a collaborator who entered the [[pericope]]s at the head of each homily) it is thought that the manuscript was finished circa 1180, but Orm may have begun the work as early as 1150 ([[#Parkes1983|Parkes 1983]], pp.&amp;nbsp;115–27). The text has few topical references to specific events that could be used to identify the period of composition more precisely.

==Manuscript==
Only one copy of the ''Ormulum'' exists, as [[Bodleian Library]] [[manuscript|MS]] Junius&amp;nbsp;1 ([[#Burchfield1987|Burchfield 1987]], p.&amp;nbsp;280). In its current state, the manuscript is incomplete: the book's table of contents claims that there were 242&amp;nbsp;homilies, but only 32 remain ([[#Matthew2004|Matthew 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;936). It seems likely that the work was never finished on the scale planned when the table of contents was written, but much of the discrepancy was probably caused by the loss of [[Section (bookbinding)|gatherings]] from the manuscript. There is no doubt that such losses have occurred even in modern times, as the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] antiquarian [[Jan van Vliet]], one of its seventeenth-century owners, copied out passages that are not in the present text (Jack, George, in [[#Matthew2004|Matthew and Harrison 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;936–37). The amount of redaction in the text, plus the loss of possible gatherings, led [[J. A. W. Bennett]] to comment that "only about one fifth survives, and that in the ugliest of manuscripts" ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;30).

The [[parchment]] used in the manuscript is of the lowest quality, and the text is written untidily, with an eye to economical use of space; it is laid out in continuous lines like prose, with words and lines close together, and with various additions and corrections, new exegesis, and allegorical readings, crammed into the corners of the margins (as can be seen in the reproduction above). [[Robert Burchfield]] argues that these indications "suggest that it was a 'workshop' draft which the author intended to have recopied by a professional scribe" ([[#Burchfield1987|Burchfield 1987]], p.&amp;nbsp;280).

It seems curious that a text so obviously written with the expectation that it would be widely copied should exist in only one manuscript and that, apparently, a draft. Treharne has taken this as suggesting that it is not only modern readers who have found the work tedious ([[#Treharne2000|Treharne 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;273). Orm, however, says in the preface that he wishes Walter to remove any wording that he finds clumsy or incorrect (quoted in [[#Bennett1982|Bennett and Smithers 1982]], pp.&amp;nbsp;175–76).

The [[provenance]] of the manuscript before the seventeenth century is unclear. From a signature on the flyleaf we know that it was in [[Jan van Vliet|van Vliet]]'s collection in 1659. It was auctioned in 1666, after his death, and probably was purchased by [[Franciscus Junius (the younger)|Franciscus Junius]], from whose library it came to the Bodleian as part of the Junius donation ([[#Holt1878|Holt 1878]], pp. liv–lvi).{{Ref label|notabene_A|A|none}}

==Contents and style==
The ''Ormulum'' consists of 18,956 lines of metrical verse, explaining Christian teaching on each of the texts used in the [[mass (liturgy)|mass]] throughout the church calendar ([[#Treharne2000|Treharne 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;273). As such, it is the first new [[homily]] cycle in English since the works of [[Ælfric of Eynsham]] (c. 990). The motivation was to provide an accessible English text for the benefit of the less educated, which might include some clergy who found it difficult to understand the Latin of the [[Vulgate]], and the parishioners who in most cases would not understand spoken Latin at all ([[#Treharne2000|Treharne 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;273).

Each homily begins with a paraphrase of a [[Gospel]] reading (important when the laity did not understand Latin), followed by [[exegesis]] ([[#Bennett1982|Bennett and Smithers 1982]], pp.&amp;nbsp;174–75). The theological content is derivative; Orm closely follows [[Bede]]'s exegesis of [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]], the ''Enarrationes in Matthoei'', and the ''[[Glossa Ordinaria]]'' of the Bible. Thus, he reads each verse primarily [[allegory|allegorically]] rather than literally (Jack, George, in [[#Matthew2004|Matthew and Harrison 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;936–37). Rather than identify individual sources, Orm refers frequently to "{{lang|enm|ðe boc}}" and to the "holy book" ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;31). Bennett has speculated that the ''Acts of the Apostles'', ''Glossa Ordinaria'', and Bede were bound together in a large [[Vulgate]] Bible in the abbey so that Orm truly was getting all of his material from a source that was, to him, a single book. ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;31).

Although the sermons have been deemed "of little literary or theological value" ([[#Burchfield1987|Burchfield 1987]], p.&amp;nbsp;280) and though Orm has been said to possess "only one rhetorical device", that of repetition ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;32), the ''Ormulum'' never was intended as a book in the modern sense, but rather as a companion to the [[liturgy]]. Priests would read, and congregations hear, only a day's entry at a time. The tedium that many experience when attempting to read the ''Ormulum'' today would not exist for persons hearing only a single homily each day. Furthermore, although Orm's poetry is, perhaps, subliterary, the homilies were meant for easy recitation or chanting, not for aesthetic appreciation; everything from the overly strict meter to the orthography might function only to aid [[Public speaking|oratory]] ([[#Bennett1982|Bennett and Smithers 1982]], pp.&amp;nbsp;174–75).

Although earlier metrical homilies, such as those of Ælfric and [[Wulfstan (died 1023)|Wulfstan]], were based on the rules of [[Old English literature|Old English poetry]], they took sufficient liberties with meter to be readable as prose. Orm does not follow their example. Rather, he adopts a "jog-trot fifteener" for his rhythm, based on the Latin [[Iamb (poetry)|iambic]] ''[[Heptameter|septenarius]]'', and writes continuously, neither dividing his work into stanzas nor rhyming his lines, again following Latin poetry ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;31). The work is unusual in that no critic ever has stepped forward to defend it on literary grounds. Indeed, Orm was humble about his oeuvre: he admits in the preface that he frequently has padded the lines to fill out the meter, "to help those who read it", and urges his brother Walter to edit the poetry to make it more meet ([[#Treharne2000|Treharne 2000]], pp.&amp;nbsp;274–75).

A brief sample may help to illustrate the style of the work. This passage explains the background to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]:

|}

==Orthography==
Rather than conspicuous literary merit, the chief scholarly value of the ''Ormulum'' derives from Orm's idiosyncratic orthographical system  ([[#Treharne2000|Treharne 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;273). He states that since he dislikes the way that people are mispronouncing English, he will spell words exactly as they are pronounced, and describes a system whereby vowel length and value are indicated unambiguously ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], pp.&amp;nbsp;31–32).

Orm's chief innovation was to employ doubled consonants to show that the preceding vowel is short and single consonants when the [[vowel length|vowel is long]] ([[#Treharne2000|Treharne 2000]], p.&amp;nbsp;273). For syllables that ended in vowels, he used accent marks to indicate length. In addition to this, he used two distinct letter forms for ''g'', using the old [[yogh]] for {{IPA|[d͡ʒ]}} and {{IPA|[j]}}, and the new ''g'' for {{IPA|[ɡ]}} (Jack, George, in [[#Matthew2004|Matthew and Harrison 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;936–37). His devotion to precise spelling was meticulous; for example, having originally used ''eo'' and ''e'' inconsistently for words such as "beon" and "kneow," which had been spelled with ''eo'' in [[Old English]], at line 13,000 he changed his mind and went back to change all ''eo'' spellings, replacing them solely with ''e'' alone (''ben'' and ''knew''), to reflect the pronunciation ([[#Matthew2004|Matthew 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;936; Jack, George, in [[#Matthew2004|Matthew and Harrison 2004]], pp.&amp;nbsp;936–37).

The combination of this system with the rigid meter, and the stress patterns this implies, provides enough information to reconstruct his pronunciation with some precision; making the reasonable assumption that Orm's pronunciation was in no way unusual, this permits scholars of [[history of English]] to develop an exceptionally precise snapshot of exactly how Middle English was pronounced in the Midlands in the second half of the twelfth century ([[#Matthew2004|Matthew 2004]], p.&amp;nbsp;936).

==Significance==
Orm's book has a number of innovations that make it valuable. As Bennett points out, Orm's adaptation of a classical meter with fixed stress patterns anticipates future English poets, who would do much the same when encountering foreign language prosodies ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;31). The ''Ormulum'' is also the only specimen of the homiletic tradition in England between Ælfric and the fourteenth century, as well as being the last example of the Old English verse homily. It also demonstrates what would become [[Modern English|Received Standard English]] two centuries before [[Geoffrey Chaucer]] ([[#Burchfield1987|Burchfield 1987]], p.&amp;nbsp;280). Further, Orm was concerned with the laity. He sought to make the Gospel comprehensible to the congregation, and he did this perhaps forty years before the [[Fourth Council of the Lateran]] of 1215 "spurred the clergy as a whole into action" ([[#Bennett1986|Bennett 1986]], p.&amp;nbsp;33). At the same time, Orm's idiosyncrasies and attempted orthographic reform make his work vital for understanding Middle English. The ''Ormulum'' is, with the ''[[Ancrene Wisse]]'' and the ''[[Ayenbite of Inwyt]]'', one of the three crucial texts that have enabled philologists to document the transformation of Old English into Middle English ([[#Burchfield1987|Burchfield 1987]], p.&amp;nbsp;280).

'''Paramatman''' ([[Sanskrit]]: परमात्मन्, [[IAST]]: Paramātmāṇ) or '''Paramātmā''' is the Absolute [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] or Supreme self) in [[Vedanta]] and [[Yoga]] philosophies in the [[Hindu]] theology. The Paramatman is the “Primordial Self” or the “Self Beyond” who is spiritually practically identical with the Absolute, identical with the [[Brahman]]. Selflessness is the attribute of Paramatman, where all personality/individuality vanishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Occult Glossary:A Comendium of Oriental and Theosophical Terms|author=T. Depurucker|publisher=Kessinger Publishing|page=130|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eRztON94euYC&amp;pg=PA130&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word stem ''paramātma'' (परमात्मन्, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmən|}}, its nominative singular being ''paramātmā'' — परमात्मा, pronounced {{IPA-sa|pərəmaːtmaː|}}) is formed from two words, ''parama'', meaning "supreme" or "highest", and ''ātma'', which means individual self.

The word “[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]” generally denotes the Individual Self, but by the word “Paramatman” which word also expresses Boundless Life, Boundless Consciousness, Boundless Substance in Boundless Space, is meant the Atman of all atmans or the Supreme Self or the Universal Self. The word “Atman” which literally means non-darkness or light, is Brahman the subtlest indestructible Divine existence. The word “Paramatman” refers to the Creator all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Atman and Paramatman|url=http://autobiography.swami.center.org/atman-and-paramatman.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Jain theology==
{{main|Jīva (Jainism)}}
In [[Jainism]], each atman or individual self is a potential Paramatman or God, both are essentially the same. It remains as atman only because of its binding [[karma|"karmic"]] limitations, until such time as those limitations are removed. As Paramatman, the atman represents the ultimate point of spiritual evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Encyclopaedia of Oriental Philosophy|publisher=Global Vision Publishing House|page=245|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZgNHE-48jNcC&amp;pg=PA245 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though Jain [[mysticism]] centers around Atman and Paramatman because it believes in the existence of soul, in Jainism, which accepts neither [[Vedic]] authority nor [[Monism]], all enlightened souls are referred to as Paramatman and regarded as gods. Jainism honours the soul of each man as its own eternally distinct [[Messiah|savior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The World’s Great Religions:An Anthology of Sacred Texts|author=Selwyn Gurney Champion|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|page=149|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wEjIX4FldtkC&amp;pg=PA149 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Paramatman of Jainism is unable to create and govern the world, there is no place of God as a creator and bestower of fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=A Jaina Perspective on the Philosophy of Religion|author=Arvind Sharma|publisher=[[Motilal Banarsidass]] |p=4 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BtbbLjvTkGMC&amp;pg=PA4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Paramatman in Buddhism==

Buddhism rejects a metaphysics of "ground" such as the paramatman.

==Description of Paramatman in the Upanishads==

The sage of the [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] IV.4.2, though not using the word “Paramatman”, explains that at the time of release the portion (aspect) of the Paramatman and the portion (aspect) of the [[Jiva]] presiding in the right eye become unified with the Paramatman and the Jiva presiding in the heart, then the Jiva does not see, smell, taste, speak, hear, feel, touch and know; when Paramatman goes out, the Chief [[Prana]] goes out after Him, followed by the Lower Prana. Paramatman goes out riding on the Jiva following consciousness and work, knowledge of former life or natural capacity. In the [[Prashna Upanishad]] IV.11 the word “Atman” cannot refer to Jiva because the Jiva cannot of its own accord throw off its body or understand avidya, therefore, it refers to Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sacred Books of the Hindus, Vol. 15.

==Parable of the Two Birds==

The word, Paramatman, is not to be found in the [[Rig Veda]] but through allusion referring to Paramatman as Isha. This distinction is made because all of its mantras which in the form of prayers are addressed to gods. In its great Riddle Hymn (Sukta I.164) is the famous mantra - R.V.I.164.20, that was revealed to Rishi Deergatamaah Auchathyah and borrowed  by [[Mundaka Upanishad]] III.1.1-3, which belongs to [[Atharva Veda]], to weave the parable of the Two Birds:-Two birds.
 
:::Two birds, beautiful of wings, close companions, cling to one common tree: of the two one eats the sweet fruit of that tree; the other eats not but watches his companion. The self is the bird that sits immersed on the common tree; but because he is not lord he is bewildered and has sorrow. But when he sees that other who is the Lord and the beloved, he knows that all is His greatness and his sorrow passes away from him. When, a seer, he sees the Golden-hued, the maker, the Lord, the Spirit who is the source of Brahman, then he becomes the knower and shakes from his wings sin and virtue; pure of all stains he reaches the supreme identity.

-Translation of Verses 1-3 of Third Mundaka Upanishad by Sri Aurobindo.

Here at, [[Aurobindo]] makes the [[Spirit]] or [[Purusha]] as the Source of everything, including [[Brahman]]. He makes Purusha more fundamental. Thus, he does not have to say Brahman to be the source of inferior Brahman, and he also dismisses the sense of Reality revealed in imaginative and emotional build-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Parable of Two Birds|author=Ry Deshpande|url=http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415120619/http://archives.mirroroftomorrow.org/blog/_archives/2010/9/30/4631783.html|archivedate=15 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case of Two souls==

The Dualistic School of Philosophy initiated by Anandatirtha draws its support from  the afore-cited passage as well as from the passage of [[Katha Upanishad]] I.3.1  of an earlier Upanishad that speaks about two souls which taste the fruits of action, both of which are lodged in the recess of the human heart, and which are different from each other as light and shade, that carried the flaw – how could the Universal soul be regarded as enjoying the fruits of action? The followers of [[Madhava (Vishnu)|Madhava]] draw their support from the [[Bhagavad Gita]] XV.16 that speaks about two persons in this world, the Mutable and the Immutable; the Mutable is all these things, while the Immutable is the one who exists at the top of them, one is the Jivatman and the other, Paramatman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=151|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jivatman is ''chit'', the sentient, and Paramatman is [[Isvara]], both have the same attributes; they are inseparably present together on the tree which is ''achit'', the insentient, or the gross ''Avidya'' component of existence. Jivatman and Paramatman are both seated in the heart, the former is driven by the three modes of nature and acts, the latter simply witnesses as though approving the former’s activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Two birds in a tree - Soul and Supersoul|url=http://www.speakingtree.in/spiritual-blogs/seekers/philosophy/two-birds-in-a-tree-soul-and-supersoul}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Paramātmā, the Universal Self, and [[Ātman (Hinduism)|'ātma]], the Individual Self, is likened to the indwelling God and the soul within one's heart. Paramatman is one of the many aspects of [[Brahman]]. Paramatman is situated at the core of every individual [[jiva]] in the [[Macrocosm and microcosm|macrocosm]]. The [[Upanishad]]s do compare Atman and Paramatman to two birds sitting like friends on the branch of a tree (body) where the Atman eats its fruits ([[karma]]), and the Paramatman only observes the Atman as a witness (sākṣin) of His friend's actions.

==Advaita==
In [[Advaita]] philosophy, individual souls are called Jīvātman, and the Highest Brahman is called Paramātman. The Jivatman and the Paramatman are known to be one and the same when the Jivatman attains the true knowledge of the Brahman (Skt. ''Brahmajñāna'')  . In the context of Advaita, the word Paramatman is invariably used to refer to [[Nirguna Brahman]], with [[Ishvara]] and [[Bhagavan]] being terms used to refer to Brahman with qualities, or [[Saguna Brahman]].

[[Brahman]] and [[Isvara]] are not synonymous words, the apparent similarity is on account of similar looking attributes imagined with regard to the impressions these two words activate. According to Advaita, Isvara is Brahman associated with Maya in its excellent aspect, as the empirical reality it is the determinate Brahman; Isvara has no reality apart from Brahman. The [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]] developed the conception of a personal God. The [[Katha Upanishad]] states that never has any man been able to visualise Paramatman by means of sight, heart, imagination or mind. The Anandamaya-kosha is the Isvara of the Upanishads. [[Gaudapada]] called duality Maya, and non-duality, the only reality. Maya is the Cosmic Nescience that has in it the plurality of subject and object and therefore, Isvara is organically bound with the world. Beyond the Prana or Isvara is the state of the Infinite limitless Brahman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A constructive survey of Upanishadic philosophy|author=Ramachandra Dattatrya Ranade|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|pages=189–197|url=https://archive.org/details/A.Constructive.Survey.of.Upanishadic.Philosophy.by.R.D.Ranade.1926.djvu}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is why in the [[Bhagavad Gita]] VII.24, Krishna tells Arjuna – “not knowing My unsurpassable and undecaying supreme nature the ignorant believe Me to have assumed a finite form through birth.”

With regard to the cause of [[Samsāra]], as to where it resides and the means of its removal, [[Adi Shankara]] in his [[Vivekachudamani]].49. instructs that the individual self is the Paramatman in reality, the association of the individual self with ''ajnana'' i.e. with ''avidya'', which he terms as ''anatmabandhah'', bondage by the [[Anatman (Hinduism)|anatman]] or non-atman, makes it to identify itself with gross, subtle and causal bodies and from that arises [[Samsāra]] which is of the form of superimposition of qualities of ''sukha'', ''dukha'' etc., on itself, the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Samkara’s Vivekacudamani|author=Sri Chandrashekhara Bharati of Sringeri|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|place=Mumbai|page=65|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ncQYAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;dq=sri+samkara's+vivekacudamani&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cSjAUOuVM4vprQe-moHoCw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brahma Kumaris==
According to [[Brahma Kumaris]] religion, Paramatma (Supreme Soul) is called [[Shiva]], or Shiva Baba. His form is a point of infinitesimal light and his abode is Paramdham or [[Nirvana]].

==Vaishnavism==
Paramatman is beyond knowledge and ignorance, devoid of all material attributes ([[upadhi]]). In Chapter 13 of the [[Bhagavad Gita]], Paramatman is described as [[Krishna]] residing in the hearts of all beings and in every atom of matter. He is the overseer and the permitter of their actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en Bhagavad Gita 13.23] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312211826/http://vedabase.net/bg/13/23/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en Bhagavata Purana 7.14.38] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312212902/http://vedabase.net/sb/7/14/38/en |date=12 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paramatman is different from five elements (pancha mahabhutas), the [[sense]]s, [[mind]], [[pradhana]] and jiva.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en Bhagavata Purana 3.28.41] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217121958/http://vedabase.net/sb/3/28/41/en |date=17 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vaishnavism#Vaishnava sampradayas|Vaishnava sects]] maintain that attaining knowledge of Brahman and identification of Atman with Brahman is an intermediate stage of self-realization, and only [[Bhakti Yoga]] can lead to the next step of Paramatman realization as the indwelling God, ultimately leading up to liberation ([[Moksha|Mukti]]) by God-realization.

The Viṣṇu or the deity of the ''quality of goodness'' in the material world is the puruṣa-avatāra known as [[Ksirodakasayi Vishnu|Kṣīrodakaśāyī Viṣṇu]] or ''Paramātmā''.[https://web.archive.org/web/20101123213949/http://vedabase.net/sb/1/2/23/en]

In Bengal, Vaishnava Krishna is viewed as one endowed with his essential svarupa-shakti, he is Bhagawat in full manifestation endowed with Jivasakti and Mayasakti, he the Paramatman and Brahman. Brahman, Paramatman and Bhagavan are 3 gradations of the ultimate reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Traditions of Mysticism in Bengal|author=Sandhu Santidev|publisher=Genesis Publishing (P) Ltd.|page=101|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JGeitIm_--cC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=paramatman&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tk7VULagB9DQrAfEnIFY&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=paramatman&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Time==
[[Time]] is described in Vedas:

{{quote|My Lord, I consider Your Lordship to be eternal time, the supreme controller, without beginning and end, the all-pervasive one. ... Eternal time is the witness of all our actions, good and bad, and thus resultant reactions are destined by Him. It is no use saying that we do not know why and for what we are suffering. We may forget the misdeed for which we may suffer at this present moment, but we must remember that Paramātmā is our constant companion, and therefore He knows everything, past, present and future. And because the Paramātmā feature of Lord Kṛṣṇa destines all actions and reactions, He is the supreme controller also. Without His sanction not a blade of grass can move.[http://vedabase.net/sb/1/8/28/en]}}

PGIS combines [[Participatory Learning and Action]] (PLA) methods with [[geographic information system]]s (GIS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |title=Overview: Mapping for Change: The emergence of a new practice |author1=Jon Corbett |author2=Giacomo Rambaldi |author3=Peter Kyem |author4=Dan Weiner |author5=Rachel Olson |author6=Julius Muchemi |author7=Mike McCall |author8=Robert Chambers |year=2006 |work=54:13-19 IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081053/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch01_overview_pp13-19.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; PGIS combines a range of geo-spatial information management tools and methods such as sketch maps, [[participatory 3D modelling]] (P3DM), [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[global positioning system]] (GPS) data to represent peoples' spatial knowledge in the forms of (virtual or physical) two- or three-dimensional maps used as interactive vehicles for spatial learning, discussion, information exchange, analysis, decision making and advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=246&amp;article=263&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Spatial Information Management and Communication in Developing Countries |author=Rambaldi G., Kwaku Kyem A.

PGIS practice is geared towards community empowerment through measured, demand-driven, user-friendly and integrated applications of geo-spatial technologies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} GIS-based maps and spatial analysis become major conduits in the process. A good PGIS practice is embedded into long-lasting spatial decision-making processes, is flexible, adapts to different socio-cultural and bio-physical environments, depends on multidisciplinary facilitation and skills and builds essentially on visual language. The practice integrates several tools and methods whilst often relying on the combination of 'expert' skills with socially differentiated local knowledge. It promotes interactive participation of stakeholders in generating and managing spatial information and it uses information about specific landscapes to facilitate broadly-based decision making processes that support effective communication and community advocacy.

If appropriately utilized,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |title=Practical ethics for PGIS practitioners, facilitators, technology intermediaries and researchers |author1=Gicomo Rambaldi |author2=Robert Chambers |author3=Mike McCall |author4=Jefferson Fox |year=2006 |work=PLA 54:106-113, IIED, London, UK |publisher=iapad.org |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716081038/http://www.iapad.org/publications/ppgis/ch14_rambaldi_pp106-113.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the practice could exert profound impacts on community empowerment, innovation and social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ejisdc.org/ojs/include/getdoc.php?id=247&amp;article=264&amp;mode=pdf |title=Participatory Mapping and Geographic Information Systems: Whose Map?

The '''[[Paul Scherrer]] Institute''' (PSI) is a multi-disciplinary research institute which belongs to the [[ETH Domain|Swiss Federal Institutes of Technology Domain]] covering also [[ETH Zurich]] and [[École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|EPFL]]. It was established in 1988 through the merger of EIR (''Eidgenössisches Institut für Reaktorforschung'', Federal Institute for Reactor Research, established in 1960) and SIN (''Schweizerisches Institut für Nuklearphysik'', Swiss Institute for Nuclear Physics, established in 1968). It is based in [[Villigen]] and [[Würenlingen]].

The PSI is a multi-disciplinary research centre for the natural sciences and technology. In national and international collaboration with universities, other research institutes and industry, PSI is active in solid-state physics, materials sciences, elementary particle physics, life sciences, nuclear and non-nuclear energy research, and energy-related ecology.

PSI is a User Laboratory, offering access to its facilities to researchers affiliated to many different institutions, and it runs several [[particle accelerator]]s. The 590&amp;nbsp;MeV [[cyclotron]], with its 72&amp;nbsp;MeV companion pre-accelerator, is one of them. {{asof|2011}}, it delivers a proton beam of up to 2.2&amp;nbsp;mA, which is the world record for such proton cyclotrons. It drives the spallation neutron source complex. The [[Swiss Light Source]] (SLS), built in 2001, is a [[synchrotron light]] source with a 2.4&amp;nbsp;GeV electron [[storage ring]]. It is one of the world's best with respect to electron beam brilliance and stability.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed:  [[Image:Aerial view of the PSI.jpg|thumb|422px|Aerial view of the Paul Scherrer Institute in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psi.ch/media/schweizer-spitzenforschung-allemand]&lt;/ref&gt;]] --&gt; An X-ray [[free-electron laser]] called [[SwissFEL]] is currently under construction and is slated to begin operation in 2016.&lt;ref name=swissfel&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/media/overview-swissfel |title=Overview: SwissFEL – the new large-scale facility at the Paul Scherrer Institute |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |website=Paul Scherrer Institute |accessdate=17 September 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140917084615/http://www.psi.ch/media/overview-swissfel|archive-date=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Injector 1 is a variable energy cyclotron built by the Dutch company [[Philips]] Gloeilampen-Fabrieken. Its one-piece magnet has an azimuthally varying magnetic field for vertical focusing even at relativistic energies. The beam energy goes up to 72 MeV for protons and 120 MeV Z2/A for ions with charge Z and mass number A. Equipped with several ion sources, Injector 1 offers a wide variety of beams ranging from protons and deuterons to light and heavy ions. Polarized beams of protons and deuterons are also available. In 1994 an ECR ion source was installed to extend its ability to accelerate heavy ions. This machine has been decommissioned on 1 December 2010.

The Injector 2 cyclotron has been built to replace the multiparticle variable energy Injector 1. It provides high intensity, high quality beams of 72&amp;nbsp;MeV protons to be injected into the 590 MeV Ring cyclotron.

The Injector 2 is itself a ring cyclotron, but with 4 sectormagnets and with an extremely low injection energy of 870&amp;nbsp;keV. The 870&amp;nbsp;keV proton beam is achieved by extracting protons from an [[ion source]] with 60&amp;nbsp;kV and additional acceleration of the particles by means of a [[Cockcroft Walton|Cockcroft-Walton]] type accelerator operated at 810&amp;nbsp;kV.

It was put in operation in 1984.

The Ring Cyclotron is a separated sector cyclotron with a fixed beam energy of 590&amp;nbsp;MeV, built by PSI and commissioned in 1974. The 72&amp;nbsp;MeV beam from either one of two injector cyclotron enters from the back of the cyclotron, is injected into an orbit in the center of the Ring, accelerated over about 186 revolutions and extracted at the full energy.

The design is based on criteria that allow operation at very high beam intensities: an open structure of four large and powerful RF-cavities providing a high acceleration voltage, and a flat-top cavity operating at the third harmonic of the accelerating RF-voltage. The resulting strong, phase-independent energy gain per revolution gives good turn separation and hence beam extraction with low beam losses. This is a mandatory condition for high current operation in a cyclotron. Presently, a continuous beam current of 2.2&amp;nbsp;mA at 590&amp;nbsp;MeV can be extracted from the ring cyclotron. This corresponds to a beam power of approximately 1.3&amp;nbsp;MW turning the PSI-proton facility into the world's most powerful accelerator complex at the moment.{{When|date=March 2016}}

==Spallation Neutron Source (SINQ)==
[[Neutron scattering]] is one of the most effective ways to obtain information on both the structure and the dynamics of condensed matter. A wide scope of problems, ranging from fundamental to solid state physics and chemistry, and from materials science to biology, medicine and environmental science, can be investigated with neutrons. Aside from the scattering techniques, non-diffractive methods like imaging techniques can also be applied with increasing relevance for industrial applications.

The spallation neutron source [http://www.psi.ch/sinq SINQ] is a continuous source – the first of its kind in the world – with a flux of about 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; n/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/s. Beside thermal neutrons, a cold moderator of liquid deuterium (cold source) slows neutrons down and shifts their spectrum to lower energies. These neutrons have proved to be particularly valuable in materials research and in the investigation of biological substances. SINQ is a user facility. Interested groups can apply for beamtime on the various instruments by using the SINQ proposal system.

==Spallation Ultracold Neutron Source (UCN)==

Neutrons from the spallation target are brought to [[Thermal neutron|thermal energies]] by means of a [[heavy water]]. Some of the neutrons are further cooled down to [[Kinetic energy#Relativistic kinetic energy of rigid bodies|kinetic energies]] below 300&amp;nbsp;neV by means of a solid [[deuterium]] moderator.&lt;ref&gt;http://ucn.web.psi.ch/posters/UCN-Source08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ucn.web.psi.ch/ucn_source_project.htm |title=UCN Home Page |publisher=Ucn.web.psi.ch |date= |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These ultra cold neutrons are used by the nEDM experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nedm.web.psi.ch/ |title=EDM Home Page |publisher=Nedm.web.psi.ch |date=2001-09-12 |accessdate=2013-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to probe the [[Neutron electric dipole moment]] at scales below the current upper limit

==Swiss Muon Source (SμS)==

Thanks to the high proton current (2200&amp;nbsp;μA), the Swiss Muon Source is the world's most intense continuous beam muon source today.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Scherrer Institut (PSI) :: Large Scale Facilities {{cite web |url=http://www.psi.ch/science/large-scale-facilities |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429220301/http://www.psi.ch/science/large-scale-facilities |archivedate=2011-04-29 |df= }}, retrieved 2011-04-02&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main applications of these intense muon beams is [[Muon spin spectroscopy]]. [[Mu to E Gamma]] and [[Mu3e]] use the beam as well.

== Proton Therapy Programme ==
Since 1984 PSI operates the OPTIS facility for treatment of eye tumours. It was the first such installation in Western Europe, developed by PSI physicists. In close cooperation with the 'Hôpital Opthalmique' of the University of Lausanne by March 2008 nearly 5000 patients have been treated at PSI with this unique method, in which a proton beam is directed accurately onto the eye tumour.

Since 1996 PSI has also operated the only compact scanning gantry in the world for proton radiation therapy of deep-seated tumours. The spot-scanning technique developed at PSI enables malignant tumours to be targeted with high precision deep inside in the body, and their growth successfully stopped, without damaging healthy tissue around the target area. By March 2008, 320 patients, suffering from brain, head and neck, skull-base, spinal cord or abdominal tumours, had been treated at Gantry 1.

The excellent and promising results of patient treatment have led to the (Project [http://p-therapie.web.psi.ch/e/proscan.html PROSCAN]) with the objectives to install a dedicated and compact [[superconducting]] proton accelerator
and to develop a new Gantry ([http://p-therapie.web.psi.ch/e/forschung.html Gantry 2]) with advanced 2-dimensional and fast parallel scanning features. The new compact superconducting cyclotron has been in operation since February 2007, and patient treatment at Gantry 2 began in November 2013. With these expansions, PSI is able to offer year-round treatment at its Center for Proton Therapy (CPT). {{asof|2015}}, work is ongoing on a third gantry with a similar specification to Gantry 2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.psi.ch/protontherapy/proton-therapy-at-psi |title= Proton Therapy at PSI |accessdate=2015-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of these developments are to increase radiation precision of even moving tumours and to transfer the knowledge and proton therapy technology into hospital-based projects.

With the expansion of the facility, PSI will be able to strengthen the clinical research program and to treat more than 500 patients per year, including those with eye tumours.

== Roles ==

'''Auditor''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing their own companies or their suppliers for compliance to international quality standards such as [[ISO9000]] and [[AS9100]]. They may also be independent auditors under an auditing body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://committee.iso.org/sites/tc176sc2/home/page/iso-9001-auditing-practices-grou.html|title=ISO 9001 Auditing Practices Group|website=committee.iso.org|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Process quality''': Quality engineers may be tasked with value stream mapping and statistical process control to determine if a process is likely to produce defective product. They may create inspection plans and criteria to ensure defective parts are detected prior to completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.automotiveengineeringhq.com/process-quality-engineer/|title=Process Quality Engineer|website=''automotiveengineeringhq.com''|accessdate=7 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Supplier quality''': Quality engineers may be responsible for auditing suppliers or performing root cause and corrective action at their facility or overseeing such activity to prevent the delivery of defective product.

== Software ==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2018}}
IT services are increasingly interlinked in workflows across platform boundaries, device and organisational boundaries, for example in cyber-physical systems, business-to-business workflows or when using cloud services. In such contexts, quality engineering facilitates the necessary all-embracing consideration of quality attributes.

In such contexts an "end-to-end" view of quality from management to operation is vital. Quality engineering integrates methods and tools from [[enterprise architecture]]-management, [[Software product management]], [[IT service management]], [[software engineering]] and [[systems engineering]], and from [[software quality management]] and [[information security management]]. This means that quality engineering goes beyond the classic disciplines of software engineering, information security management or software product management since it integrates management issues (such as business and IT strategy, risk management, business process views, knowledge and information management, operative performance management), design considerations (including the [[software development process]], [[requirements analysis]], [[software testing]]) and operative considerations (such as configuration, monitoring, [[IT service management]]). In many of the fields where it is used, quality engineering is closely linked to compliance with legal and business requirements, contractual obligations and standards. As far as quality attributes are concerned, reliability, security and safety of IT services play a predominant role.

In quality engineering, quality objectives are implemented in a collaborative process. This process requires the interaction of largely independent actors whose knowledge is based on different sources of information.

== Quality objectives ==

[[Quality objectives]] describe basic requirements for [[software quality]]. In quality engineering they often address the quality attributes of availability, security, safety, reliability and performance. With the help of quality models like ISO/IEC 25000 and methods like the [[GQM|Goal Question Metric]] approach it is possible to attribute metrics to quality objectives. This allows measuring the degree of attainment of quality objectives. This is a key component of the quality engineering process and, at the same time, is a prerequisite for its continuous monitoring and control. To ensure effective and efficient measuring of quality objectives the integration of core numbers, which were identified manually (e.g. by expert estimates or reviews), and automatically identified metrics (e.g. by statistical analysis of source codes or automated regression tests) as a basis for decision-making is favourable.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=Proceedings of the 32nd ACM/IEEE International Conference on Software Engineering |author1=Michael Kläs |author2=Frank Elberzhager |author3=Jürgen Münch |author4=Klaus Hartjes |author5=Olaf von Graevemeyer | title=Transparent combination of expert and measurement data for defect prediction: an industrial case study | accessdate=8 April 2014 | date=2–8 May 2010 | publisher=ACM New York, USA | volume=2 | url=http://www.klaes.org/Z-files/Klaes-2010-ICSE-Paper.pdf | pages=119–128 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Actors ==

The end-to-end quality management approach to quality engineering requires numerous actors with different responsibilities and tasks, different expertise and involvement in the organisation.

Different roles involved in quality engineering:
* Business architect, 
* IT architect, 
* Security officer, 
* Requirements engineer, 
* Software quality manager,
* Test manager,
* Project manager,
* Product manager and 
* Security architect.

Typically, these roles are distributed over geographic and organisational boundaries. Therefore, appropriate measures need to be taken to coordinate the heterogeneous tasks of the various roles in quality engineering and to consolidate and synchronize the data and information necessary in fulfilling the tasks, and to make them available to each actor in an appropriate form.

== Knowledge management ==

[[Knowledge management]] plays an important part in quality engineering.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | journal=IEEE Software |author1=Jacek Czerwonka |author2=Nachiappan Nagappan |author3=Wolfram Schulte |author4=Brendan Murphy | title=CODEMINE: Building a Software Development Data Analytics Platform at Microsoft | accessdate=7 April 2014 | date=July–August 2013 | publisher=IEEE Computer Society | volume=30 | number=4 | url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/200717/CodeMine.pdf | pages=64–71 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The quality engineering knowledge base comprises manifold structured and unstructured data, ranging from code repositories via requirements specifications, standards, test reports, enterprise architecture models to system configurations and runtime logs. Software and system models play an important role in mapping this knowledge. The data of the quality engineering knowledge base are generated, processed and made available both manually as well as tool-based in a geographically, organisationally and technically distributed context. Of prime importance is the focus on [[quality assurance]] tasks, early recognition of risks, and appropriate support for the collaboration of actors.

This results in the following requirements for a quality engineering knowledge base:

* Knowledge is available in a quality as required. Important quality criteria include that knowledge is consistent and up-to-date as well as complete and adequate in terms of granularity in relation to the tasks of the appropriate actors.
* Knowledge is interconnected and traceable in order to support interaction between the actors and to facilitate analysis of data. Such traceability relates not only to interconnectedness of data across different levels of abstraction (e.g. connection of requirements with the services realizing them) but also to their traceability over time periods, which is only possible if appropriate versioning concepts exist. Data can be interconnected both manually as well as (semi-) automatically.
* Information has to be available in a form that is consistent with the [[domain knowledge]] of the appropriate actors. Therefore, the knowledge base has to provide adequate mechanisms for information transformation (e.g. aggregation) and visualization. The [[RACI matrix|RACI]] concept is an example of an appropriate model for assigning actors to information in a quality engineering knowledge base.
* In contexts, where actors from different organisations or levels interact with each other, the quality engineering knowledge base has to provide mechanisms for ensuring confidentiality and integrity.
* Quality engineering knowledge bases offer a whole range of possibilities for analysis and finding information in order to support quality control tasks of actors.

== Collaborative processes ==

The quality engineering process comprises all tasks carried out manually and in a (semi-)automated way to identify, fulfil and measure any quality features in a chosen context. The process is a highly collaborative one in the sense that it requires interaction of actors, widely acting independently from each other.

The quality engineering process has to integrate any existing sub-processes that may comprise highly structured processes such as [[IT service management]] and processes with limited structure such as [[agile software development]]. Another important aspect is change-driven procedure, where change events, such as changed requirements are dealt with in the local context of information and actors affected by such change. A pre-requisite for this is methods and tools, which support change propagation and change handling.

The objective of an efficient quality engineering process is the coordination of automated and manual [[quality assurance]] tasks. Code review or elicitation of quality objectives are examples of manual tasks, while regression tests and the collection of code metrics are examples for automatically performed tasks. The quality engineering process (or its sub-processes) can be supported by tools such as ticketing systems or security management tools.

The '''Religious Studies Center''' (RSC) is the research and publishing arm of [[BYU Religious Education|Religious Education]] at [[Brigham Young University]] (BYU), sponsoring scholarship on [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saint]] (LDS) [[Culture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|culture]], [[History of the Latter Day Saint movement|history]], [[Standard Works|scripture]], and [[Beliefs and practices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|doctrine]].&lt;ref name=RE2003&gt;{{cite journal | title=Religious Studies Center | journal=Religious Educator | year=2003 | volume=4 | issue=1 | pages=110–111 | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/RelEducator,437 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The dean of Religious Education serves as the RSC's director, and an associate dean oversees the two branches of the RSC: research and publications.

==History==

Holland]], dean of Religious Education at BYU.&lt;ref name=treasury&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Preface | title=A Book of Mormon Treasury: Gospel Insights From General Authorities and Religious Educators | year=2003 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | location=Provo, Utah | page=ix–x | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,22453 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the recommendation of [[List of presidents of Brigham Young University}BYU president]] [[Dallin H. Oaks]], the establishment of the RSC was approved by BYU's Board of Trustees in early 1976.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; Holland became the RSC's first director, with Keith H. Meservy, assistant professor of ancient scripture, as administrator.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; In 1976, Holland was appointed  [[Church Educational System#Chronology of the Commissioner of Church Education|Commissioner of Church Education]], and [[Ellis T. Rasmussen]] replaced him as dean of Religious Instruction and general director of the RSC.&lt;ref&gt;Rasmussen served as dean from 1976-81.  See: {{cite journal | author=McCarlie, V. Wallace | title=Sidney B. Sperry: Father of Religious Education at BYU | journal=Religious Education Review | date=Winter 2009 | url=http://byureligiouseducationreview.com/2009WinterSidneySperry.php | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100126183328/http://byureligiouseducationreview.com/2009WinterSidneySperry.php | archivedate=2010-01-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Religious Education dean is also the RSC general director.  For Rasmussen, see: {{cite journal | author=Anderson, Lavina Fielding | authorlink=Lavina Fielding Anderson | title=A Respectful Meeting of the Minds | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=June 1978 | page=70| url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1978/06/a-respectful-meeting-of-the-minds | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The RSC brought together several earlier BYU institutions. It became the home of the '''Richard L. Evans Chair of Christian Understanding''',&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt; which had been founded in 1973 with [[Truman G. Madsen]] as its first occupant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Chair of Christian Understanding Founded | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=January 1973 | page=138 | url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1973/01/news-of-the-church/chair-of-christian-understanding-founded | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madsen became a professor emeritus in 1994, and the position was renamed the '''Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding''', reflecting the hope that holders would extend the hand of friendship to all people, not just Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Grover |first=Steven David |date=2008 |title=Building Bridges: The Richard L. Evans Chair of Religious Understanding |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/volume-9-number-2-2008/building-bridges-richard-l-evans-chair-religious-understanding |journal=Religious Educator |volume=9 |issue=2 |pages=45–56 |publisher=[[Brigham Young University]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RSC also assumed and expanded upon the activities of the '''Institute of Mormon Studies''', which was founded to study Mormon history and doctrine under [[Daniel H. Ludlow]] in 1961 and Madsen in 1966. Likewise, the RSC absorbed the '''Book of Mormon Institute''', a center for research on the [[Book of Mormon]], with Ludlow as its first director in 1965, followed by [[Paul R. Cheesman]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=wilkinson/&gt;

In September 1985, at the request of Holland, then BYU's president, the RSC began holding annual symposia on the Book of Mormon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Cheesman, Paul R. | authorlink=Paul R. Cheesman | chapter=Preface | title=The Book of Mormon: The Keystone Scripture: Papers from the First Annual Book of Mormon Symposium | page=ix | year=1988 | publisher=Religious Studies Center | url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/u?/rsc,19326 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first of these was organized by  [[Paul R.

Cheesman (1921-1991) Papers, 1945-1991 |publisher=[[Harold B. Lee Library]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each symposium successively covered following sections of the book&lt;ref name=matthews87&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Conversation about the BYU Religious Studies Center | journal=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] | date=January 1987 | pages=79–80 | url=http://www.lds.org/ensign/1987/01/news-of-the-church/a-conversation-about-the-byu-religious-studies-center | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1994, when papers on the entire book had been published in nine anthology volumes in the ''Book of Mormon Symposium Series''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Religious Studies Center Publications | editor=[[Monte S.

The faculty publications directors have consisted of [[S. Kent Brown]] (1985{{snd}}1987), Charles D. Tate Jr. (1987{{snd}}1994), [[Kent P. Jackson]] (1994{{snd}}2001), Richard D. Draper (2001{{snd}}2004), [[Richard N. Holzapfel]] (2004{{snd}}2010), [[Robert L. Millet]] (2010{{snd}}2012), Dana M. Pike (2012{{snd}}2013), Thomas A. Wayment (2013{{snd}}2018), and [https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles Scott C. Esplin] (2018{{snd}}present).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles |title=Faculty and Staff Profiles |website=Religious Studies Center |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; All have significantly influenced the nature and quality of the academic books and journal articles published.

In 2001, the dean of Religious Education, Andrew C. Skinner, asked Richard D. Draper to reorganize the center with Holzapfel as editor of the new ''Religious Educator'' journal and [https://rsc.byu.edu/faculty-and-staff-profiles Devan Jensen] as executive editor to professionalize the publications. The RSC created a new advisory board with male and female members from diverse backgrounds with interest in ancient scripture and modern history and doctrine of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church). Draper negotiated a partnership with Covenant Communications to publish RSC materials; that partnership lasted about five years. The ''Religious Educator'' relied on copyediting by Ted D. Stoddard with design work by Stephen Hales Creative, based in Provo, Utah. Holzapfel started a project to digitize past RSC content; initiated translation of selected articles into Spanish, Portuguese, and German; and launched the ''BYU Religious Education Review'' magazine. Under the leadership of directors Millet, Pike, and Wayment, publications continued to win awards (see list below) and reach a wider audience.

==Purpose==
The RSC seeks to improve religion teaching at BYU, to encourage LDS religious studies, and to promote the study of other religions.  Believing that [[General Authority|church leaders]], not scholars, are the ultimate doctrinal authority, the RSC seeks to only add historical, cultural, and linguistic context and to explore new views of the LDS religious tradition.&lt;ref name=RE2003/&gt; The RSC coordinates and publishes this research&lt;ref name=waterman&gt;{{cite journal | author=Waterman, Bryan | title=A Guide to the Mormon Universe: Mormon Organizations &amp; Periodicals | journal=[[Sunstone Magazine|Sunstone]] | date=December 1994 | issue=97 | page=52 | format=[[PDF]] | url=http://www.sunstonemagazine.com/pdf/097-44-65.pdf | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the hopes of growing the body of LDS literature and thought.&lt;ref name=RE2003/&gt;

In 1977, as Church Commissioner of Education, Holland told the center that he hoped it would bring dialogue with other cultures and religions, leading to greater understanding, brotherhood, and peace.&lt;ref name=ofcountries/&gt;  Later, as president of BYU in 1986, Holland recalled that the RSC was established to inform those within the university and the general LDS membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Holzapfel, Richard N. | authorlink=Richard N. Holzapfel | title=It's a classic! | date=October 21, 2008 | work=RSC Blog | url=http://rsc.byu.edu/blog/?p=4 | accessdate=2009-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the RSC began posting its complete library in English and selections in Spanish and Portuguese in order to increase its worldwide presence.&lt;ref&gt;http://rsc.byu.edu/{{full citation needed|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symposia and Conferences===
A primary function of the RSC is the organization of symposia and conferences on religious subjects, from which selected papers are later published.&lt;ref name=waterman/&gt; Anthologies from symposia on broad topics make up several volumes in the RSC Monograph Series.&lt;ref name=supporting&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Larry C. |year=1985 |title=Supporting Saints: Life Stories of Nineteenth-Century Mormons |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/out-print/supporting-saints-life-stories-nineteenth-century-mormons |pages=xi–xii |publisher=Religious Studies Center |location=Provo, Utah |chapter=Foreword |chapterurl=https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/supporting-saints-life-stories-nineteenth-century-mormons/foreword-and-introduction |isbn=0-8849-4565-0 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moorty |first=S.

The RSC is also involved with the annual [[Sidney B. Sperry Symposium]],&lt;ref name=treasury/&gt; which have been held at BYU since 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | chapter=Sperry, Sidney B. | author=Rasmussen, Ellis T. | title=Encyclopedia of Latter-day Saint History | editor=[[Richard O.

Garr]] | publisher=[[Deseret Book]] | location=Salt Lake City, Utah | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often, [[general authorities]] deliver the keynote addresses at these symposia.&lt;ref name=treasury/&gt;

In 2003 the Religious Education Administrative Council approved a proposal by Richard Neitzel Holzapfel and Thomas A. Wayment to host a conference on the Saturday before Easter which would focus on Jesus's last twenty-four hours and Resurrection. The conference was held and rebroadcast on KBYU Television, helping Religious Education expand its audience. The response to this conference, now called the [http://rsc.byu.edu/easterconference BYU Easter Conference], was so positive that the university decided it should be an annual event, cosponsored by Religious Education and the RSC. Early on, nearly one thousand attendees heard Elder D. Todd Christofferson give the keynote address at the second annual conference, "The Atonement and the Resurrection," later published in the ''Religious Educator''. In subsequent years, the event was shifted to Fridays, often targeted to coincide with Good Friday. Over the years keynote addresses were delivered by President [[Cecil O. Samuelson]] in 2006, Elder F. Enzio Busche in 2007, and Sister [[Bonnie D. Parkin]] in 2009. An estimated 2,500 people attended the 2013 Easter Conference that featured Elder [[John M. Madsen]], [[Bradley R. Wilcox|Brad Wilcox]], and [[Brent L. Top]]. Other well-known keynote addresses have been given by [[Elaine S. Dalton]], [[Spencer J. Condie]], [[Sheri L. Dew]], and BYU president, [[Kevin J Worthen]].&lt;ref&gt;https://rsc.byu.edu/easterconference&lt;/ref&gt; The annual event has stayed quite popular among people living along the [[Wasatch Front]]. The proceedings are published every other year by the RSC in cooperation with  [[Deseret Book]].

In 2006 the RSC began sponsoring the [http://rsc.byu.edu/conferences Church History Symposium], copublishing the proceedings with [[Deseret Book]]. Professor [[Alexander L. Baugh]] initiated the event by proposing a conference to acknowledge the two hundredth anniversary of [[Oliver Cowdery]]'s birth. Since that time, this event has become a premier venue for rigorous and faithful scholarship on Church history. The topics have been Oliver Cowdery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsc.byu.edu/recent-books-archived/days-never-be-forgotten-oliver-cowdery|title=Days Never to Be Forgotten: Oliver Cowdery|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wilford Woodruff]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent/banner-gospel-wilford-woodruff |title=Banner of the Gospel: Wilford Woodruff |website=Religious Studies Center |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Taylor (Mormon)|John Taylor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsc.byu.edu/archived/champion-liberty-john-taylor|title=Champion of Liberty: John Taylor|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Preserving the History of the Latter-day Saints,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent/preserving-history-latter-day-saints|title=Preserving the History of the Latter-day Saints|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A Firm Foundation: Church Organization and Administration,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent/firm-foundation-administrative-and-organizational-history-church|title=A Firm Foundation|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Go Ye into All the World: The Growth and Development of Mormon Missionary Work,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://rsc.byu.edu/recent-books/go-ye-all-world|title=Go Ye into All the World|publisher=Rsc.byu.edu|accessdate=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Joseph F.

===Periodicals===
In addition to books and articles, the RSC publishes its own periodicals.&lt;ref name="RE2003" /&gt; In 1986 the RSC began publishing the quarterly&lt;ref name="matthews87" /&gt; (later triannual) ''Religious Studies Center Newsletter'', which carried updates on RSC symposia, books, and research,&lt;ref name="waterman" /&gt; and was distributed to Church Educational System faculty and LDS military chaplains.&lt;ref name="matthews87" /&gt;  In 2008 the newsletter was replaced by ''BYU Religious Education Review'', a semiannual magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://catalog.lib.byu.edu/uhtbin/cgisirsi/?ps=VG1FAxkplw/LEE/152540253/8/2016759/BYU+religious+education+review |title=BYU Religious Education Review |website=[[Harold B. Lee Library]] |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Dean Robert L. Millet and others created the ''Religious Educator'' journal to focus on "teaching the gospel, publishing studies on scripture, doctrine, and LDS Church history, and sharing the messages of outstanding devotional essays."&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Educator'' 1 (2000): i.&lt;/ref&gt; Millet replaced the temporary editorial board in 2001 with Richard Neitzel Holzapfel, who became the full-time editor in chief. Holzapfel asked Ted D. Stoddard, a professor in the Marriott School of Business, to explore design and content issues and prepare guidelines that would enhance the scholarly basis of this new publication. Holzapfel clarified the purpose of this new venture: "Our hope is to provide readers with carefully prepared, inspirational, and information-packed writings on a wide range of subjects explicitly associated with the Restoration. Teachers, authors, researchers, and students of Latter-day Saint studies at every level will appreciate discussions of relevant ideas and issues from a perspective of faith."&lt;ref&gt;''Religious Educator'' 3, no. 2 (2002): vi&lt;/ref&gt; The main audience consists of Church Educational System teachers, such as volunteers and paid professionals in [[LDS Seminaries]] and [[Institutes of Religion]] and religion professors at church colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Religious Educator: Perspectives on the Restored Gospel |journal=Religious Educator |date=Spring 2000 |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=i |url=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/RelEducator/id/376 |accessdate=November 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the RSC agreed to oversee and help fund the student journal ''Studia Antiqua''.

==Types of diseases==
Because pornographic film making involves [[unsimulated sex]], usually without [[condom]]s ([[Bareback (sex)|barebacking]]), pornographic actors are particularly vulnerable to [[sexually transmitted disease]]s including [[Chlamydia infection|chlamydia]], [[gonorrhea]],  [[syphilis]], and [[HIV/AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez-Hart|first1=C|last2=Chitale|first2=RA|last3=Rigg|first3=R|last4=Goldstein|first4=BY|last5=Kerndt|first5=PR|last6=Tavrow|first6=P|title=Sexually transmitted infection testing of adult film performers: is disease being missed?|journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases|date=December 2012|volume=39|issue=12|pages=989–94|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3182716e6e|pmid=23191956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grudzen|first1=CR|last2=Meeker|first2=D|last3=Torres|first3=J|last4=Du|first4=Q|last5=Andersen|first5=RM|last6=Gelberg|first6=L|title=HIV and STI risk behaviors, knowledge, and testing among female adult film performers as compared to other California women|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=February 2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=517–22|doi=10.1007/s10461-011-0090-0|pmid=22101890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=BY|last2=Steinberg|first2=JK|last3=Aynalem|first3=G|last4=Kerndt|first4=PR|title=High Chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence and reinfection among performers in the adult film industry|journal=Sexually Transmitted Diseases|date=July 2011|volume=38|issue=7|pages=644–8|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e318214e408|pmid=21844714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former pornographic actress [[Shelley Lubben]], a 1980s outbreak of HIV led to the death of 27 porn stars between 1985 and 1992, including [[Wade Nichols]] (who died in 1985),&lt;ref name=Lubben2013/&gt; [[John Holmes (actor)|John Holmes]] (1988), [[Marc Stevens (actor)|Marc Stevens]] (1989), and [[Al Parker]] (1992).&lt;ref name=Lubben2013&gt;{{cite web |last=Lubben |first=Shelley |date=September 3, 2013 |title=STD and HIV Outbreaks in the Porn Industry Since the 1980's |url=http://pornharmsresearch.com/2013/09/std-and-hiv-outbreaks-in-the-porn-industry-since-the-1980s/ |type=compilation |website=pornharmsresearch.com |publisher=Morality in Media |accessdate=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1986, Holmes was diagnosed as HIV-positive. Six months previously, he had tested negative. During the summer of 1986, Holmes, knowing his HIV status, agreed to perform in two pornographic films to be filmed in Italy, without informing the producers of his HIV status. Performers in one film, ''The Rise and Fall of the Roman Empress'', were [[Ilona Staller|Ilona "Cicciolina" Staller]], who later became a member of the Italian parliament, [[Tracey Adams]], [[Christoph Clark]], and [[Amber Lynn]].&lt;ref name=Huge2008&gt;{{cite book |author=Various |year=2008 |editor-last=Patrick |editor-first=John |title=Huge |publisher=STARbooks |page=13 |isbn=978-1-934187-29-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Performers in the other film, ''The Devil In Mr. Holmes'', were Adams, Lynn, [[Karin Schubert]], and [[Marina Hedman]].{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Subsequently, it was revealed that Holmes had consciously chosen not to reveal his HIV status to his producers or co-stars before engaging in unprotected sex for the filming.&lt;ref name=Huge2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden010112&gt;{{cite news |last=Holden |first=Stephen |date=12 January 2001 |title= WADD: The Life and Times of John C.

After four years of no reported HIV-issues within the industry, in April 2004, AIM diagnosed [[Darren James]] as being HIV-positive. It was concluded that James had been infected while engaging in unprotected [[anal sex]] with Brazilian actress Bianca Biaggi during a scene for the video ''Split That Booty 2'' in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref name=AVNTest&gt;[http://business.avn.com/articles/15953.html AVN - Test Results Pending for Two Performers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618141354/http://business.avn.com/articles/15953.html |date=2009-06-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afyi"&gt;{{cite web

The heterosexual segment of the porn industry voluntarily shut down for 30 days (a 60-day moratorium was originally announced but it was lifted early) while it tried to deal with the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/7652.php AIDS in pornography industry of California contained says adult industry body]&lt;/ref&gt; Darren James, Jessica Dee, and Lara Roxx were barred from further production of sexually explicit content. About 60 actors who had had contact with James or Roxx were barred from working until HIV tests were completed and they were declared HIV negative. A further estimated 130 actors who had had contact with James were tested and received an HIV-negative result. A total of five actors were diagnosed with the virus by the end of the moratorium: one male and four females, including one transgender woman&lt;ref name="afyi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="lat1" /&gt; named Jennifer.&lt;ref name=AVNMay2004 /&gt;

In June 2009, AIM reported that a female adult entertainer had tested positive, though it was believed that transmission occurred in her private life. LA County Public Health claimed that there had been 16 "unreported" HIV cases in the adult film industry. The AIM Healthcare Foundation claimed those cases did not involve actors in production companies that followed their testing protocols and included members of the general public who used AIM Healthcare testing services or individuals attempting to work in the porn industry who never were able to obtain employment in adult films because of their failure to provide proof negative status for HIV or other STD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-porn-hiv12-2009jun12,0,3569962.story More porn HIV cases disclosed]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2010, AIM reported that an actor or actress had been infected with HIV. The name and gender of the person was not released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/10/porn-actor-has-tested-positive-for-hiv-industry-clinic-officials-confirm.html|title=Porn Actor has Tested Positive for HIV; Industry Clinic Officials Confirm a Quarantine is in Effect|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=October 12, 2010|accessdate=October 13, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20101013025742/http://latimesblogs.latimes.com//lanow//2010//10//porn-actor-has-tested-positive-for-hiv-industry-clinic-officials-confirm.html| archivedate= 13 October 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivid Entertainment]] and [[Wicked Pictures]] were the first companies to announce a production shutdown.

In December, the HIV positive performer was identified as Derrick Burts. Burts had worked in both heterosexual and gay pornography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/health/la-me-porn-hiv-20101208,0,5306958.story | work=Los Angeles Times | first=Molly | last=Hennessy-Fiske | date=December 8, 2010 | title=HIV-positive porn performer speaks out}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite contracting [[gonorrhea]], [[chlamydia infection|chlamydia]] and [[syphilis]], Burts continued taking part in unprotected sex in films before quitting once he was diagnosed as being HIV positive. He was informed by the Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation that he had contracted the disease, which according to Burts, he received on a set outside the AIM system, while having oral sex scene with another "[[HIV positive]] male actor".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/derrick-burts-hiv-in-pornography-the-naked-truth-2167532.html | location=London | work=The Independent | title=Derrick Burts: HIV in pornography: the naked truth | date=December 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011, the industry was temporarily shut down because of news of a performer was testing positive for the virus. [[Diane Duke]], executive director of the [[Free Speech Coalition]], confirmed the situation.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} Production later resumed production when a performer was retested and it came back negative.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Rumors surfaced of a fourth HIV positive test during September but they were never substantiated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Moratorium Update|url=https://www.freespeechcoalition.com/component/content/article/230-moratorium-update-september-9-2013.html|accessdate=9 September 2013|work=Free Speech Coalition|date=9 September 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131205073222/http://www.freespeechcoalition.com/component/content/article/230-moratorium-update-september-9-2013.html|archive-date=2013-12-05|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, a male porn actor tested HIV positive, leading FSC to halt production for one week. This infection was also determined to have taken place off-set.&lt;ref name="PASS Blog"/&gt;

==Testing and clinics==
The revelations led to the creation of the [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] (AIM Healthcare or AIM) in 1998, which helped set up a monitoring system in the pornographic film industry in the United States, and pornographic film actors were required to be tested for HIV every 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Basten|first=Fred |author2=Laurie Holmes |author3=John C. Holmes|title=Porn King: The John Holmes Story|year=1998|publisher=John Holmes Inc|isbn=978-1-880047-69-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AIM system required all sexual contact to be logged, with positive test results leading to all sexual contacts for the last three to six months being contacted and re-tested. The use of condoms became standard in films featuring homosexual [[anal sex]].{{why?|date=January 2018}} Due to accurate and mandatory medical tests, HIV and [[AIDS]] cases became rare in the pornographic film industry.{{source needed|date=January 2018}}

However, testing is voluntary (though refusal to be tested can result in the actor not being cast in a sex role) and there is no testing or monitoring of the pornographic film industry in other countries. There have been indications that actors have voluntarily left the industry, at least the industry in the United States, rather than be tested by AIM and have their AIDS and HIV status disclosed.

AIM closed all its operations in May 2011, forcing the industry to look for other mechanisms for supporting and enforcing regular testing.&lt;ref name="romero"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.laweekly.com/informer/2011/05/porn_clinic_closed_aim_testing.php|title=Porn Clinic AIM Closes For Good: Valley-Based Industry Scrambles to Find New STD Testing System|last=Dennis Romero|date=May 3, 2011|work=[[LA Weekly]]|accessdate=May 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gap was filled by the [[Free Speech Coalition]], which set up the APHSS system, now known as [[Performer Availability Screening Services]] (PASS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FSC Pass |url=http://www.fscpass.com|accessdate= |date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==

===Regulations to limit the spread of HIV===
Due to this limited outbreak, the California State government considered regulating the industry. Some proposed to mandate the wearing of [[condom]]s during sexually explicit scenes. Industry insiders say this would ruin sales of their wares since the unprotected content is one of the selling points of some of their films. They say the wearing of condoms ruins the sexual fantasies of many viewers. Insiders say that such regulation would force the industry underground, out of California or overseas where it would be more prone to health risks for performers. The non-profit [[Adult Industry Medical Health Care Foundation]] (AIM Healthcare) worked with the government, to develop policies that both the industry and the government would find acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 1892037 | pmid=17579507 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040126 | volume=4 | issue=6 | title=The adult film industry: time to regulate? | year=2007 | journal=PLoS Med. | pages=e126 | last1 = Grudzen | first1 = CR | last2 = Kerndt | first2 = PR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ballot measure in Los Angeles ===
In the 2012 election voters in Los Angeles were presented with [[Measure B]] ("Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act") with the following text:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/2012/11/06/ca/la/meas/B/|title=Measure B: Safer Sex In the Adult Film Industry Act - Los Angeles County, CA|accessdate=2012-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Shall an ordinance be adopted requiring producers of adult films to obtain a County public health permit, to require adult film performers to use condoms while engaged in sex acts, to provide proof of blood borne pathogen training course, to post permit and notices to performers, and making violations of the ordinance subject to civil fines and criminal charges?}}

Proponents of the measure claimed pornography performers were significantly more likely to acquire HIV than the general population and that they are generally not given health insurance by their employers and so the tax payer would foot the bill for HIV treatment. Opponents claimed it to be a waste of tax dollars because of existing stringent HIV testing protocols and because nobody has contracted HIV on set in the past eight years in the United States.{{When|date=September 2016}}

The measure passed with 57% voting for and 43% voting against.&lt;ref name=DailyMail8November2012&gt;{{cite news|last=Shergold|first=Adam|title=California votes to mandate condoms in porn industry|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2229232/Measure-B-California-votes-mandate-condoms-LA-porn-industry-amid-fears-industry-leave-state.html?ITO=1490&amp;ns_mchannel=rss&amp;ns_campaign=1490|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Daily Mail (London)|date=8 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Porn industry trade group vows to fight condom requirement|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/11/porn-industry-trade-group-plans-to-fight-condom-decision.html|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=7 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] tried several times to have California's Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health's Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to [[occupational safety and health]] regulation; in a 2014 case brought against [[Treasure Island Media]] an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitz-Gerald|first1=Sean|title=Condoms Required for CA Porn Performers: Judge|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Judge-Issues-Landmark-Ruling-on-Unprotected-Porn-242117921.html|work=NBC Southern California|date=January 27, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Het Schilder-Boeck''''' or '''''Schilderboek''''' is a book written by the [[Southern Netherlands|Flemish]] writer and painter [[Karel van Mander]] first published in 1604 in [[Haarlem]] in the [[Dutch Republic]], where van Mander resided.  The book is written in 17th century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and its title is commonly translated into English as 'The Book of Painters' or 'The Book of (or on) Painting' and sometimes as 'The Book on Picturing'.  Het Schilder-Boeck consists of six parts and is considered one of the principal sources on the history of art and art theory in the 15th and 16th century [[Low Countries]]. The book was very well received and sold well.  Karel van Mander died two years after its publication.  A second posthumous edition, which included a brief, anonymous biography of van Mander was published in 1618.  This second edition was translated by [[Hessel Miedema]] into English and published in 1994-1997 together with a facsimile of the original and 5 volumes of notes on the text.

==Summary==
Het Schilder-Boeck is divided into six parts that have separate title pages and are indexed.  The parts are:

* '''The foundations of the noble and free art of painting''' (''Den Grondt der Edel vry Schilder-const: Waer in haer ghestalt, aerdt ende wesen, de leer-lustighe Jeught in verscheyden Deelen in Rijm-dicht wort voor ghedraghen.'')
* '''Lives of the illustrious ancient painters including Egyptians, Greek and Romans''' (''Het Leven Der oude Antijcke doorluchtighe Schilders, soo wel Egyptenaren, Griecken als Romeynen'')
* '''Lives of the modern or contemporary illustrious Italian painters''' (''Het Leven Der Moderne, oft dees-tijtsche doorluchtighe Italiaensche Schilders.'')
* '''Lives of the illustrious Netherlandish and German painters''' (''Het Leven der Doorluchtighe Nederlandtsche, en Hooghduytsche Schilders.'')
* '''Commentary on the Metamorphoses of Publius Ovidius Nasso''' (''Wtlegghingh op den Metamorphosis Pub. Ouidij Nasonis.'')
* '''Depiction of figures''' (''Uvtbeeldinge der Figueren'')

==Historiographic background==
The history of early Netherlandish painting was first described by the Italian [[Lodovico Guicciardini]] in his ''Descrittione di Lodovico Guicciardini patritio fiorentino di tutti i Paesi Bassi altrimenti detti Germania inferiore ''(1567; The Description of the Low Countries).  This book formed a source for [[Giorgio Vasari]]'s famous biographical accounts of painters in his book ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', often referred to as the "Vite".  
That tradition took little account of the geographic topology of the [[Low countries]] and the [[van Eyck]] brothers were considered the fathers of Netherlandish painting concentrated in [[Bruges]]. Karel van Mander intended to correct this misconception by listing all the famous early Netherlandish painters.  He encountered many difficulties in obtaining accurate information, due to the political and religious unrest at the time.

The biographies in the Schilder-Boeck are similar in style and format to Vasari's ''Vite''.  Karel van Mander digresses only rarely from the format: starting per painter with an overview of the childhood years and a list of teachers, followed by some career information and concluding with a list of notable works. The second edition includes a biography of van Mander himself that Miedema believes was written by his brother, who may have been with him on his deathbed.  Other candidates have been proposed as authors of the biography.  Recently his son [[Karel van Mander the Younger]] was identified as a possible author.  His son would have relied on biographical information that Karel van Mander had written himself as well as on his own recollections and notes.  The information in the biographical sketch is not entirely reliable but is still regarded as the best source of information on van Mander's life.&lt;ref name=du&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001199301_01/_zev001199301_01_0012.php H. Duits, 'Het leven van Karel van Mander. Kunstenaarsleven of schrijversbiografie?'], De zeventiende eeuw 9 (1993), nr. 2, p. 117-136&lt;/ref&gt;

Van Mander was writing in a country where [[Calvinist]]s were powerful and religious art was regarded with suspicion. The market for religious subjects was quickly replaced in favor of genre scenes and historical allegories. It became fashionable to choose politically correct subjects such as stories too old to be offensive to either Protestants or Catholics. The city of Haarlem needed to reinvent itself after losing its attraction as a pilgrimage site for St. [[Bavo]]. Its leaders commissioned paintings depicting the city's glorious past, such as in the story of the crusade against [[Damietta]], which was the basis for the [[Coat of arms of Haarlem]]. Artists and writers helped update the local source of inspiration for art.  Van Mander contributed to this effort by supplying a list of biographies of ancient painters in ''Lives of Ancient Egyptian, Greek and Roman painters'' and his commentaries on [[Ovid]]'s Metamorphoses and the depiction of figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0277.htm Index] to ''Lives of great Greek and Roman painters'' on the [[Digital library for Dutch literature|DBNL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The six parts of the ''Schilder-Boeck''==

===The foundations of the noble and free art of painting===
The book begins with a book on the "foundation" of the art of paintings. This introductory book has fourteen chapters on art theory listing such subjects as landscapes, animals, drapery, and arrangements of subjects.

===Lives of the illustrious ancient painters including Egyptians, Greek and Roman===
''Het Schilder-boek''{{'}}s biographies of ancient painters is almost entirely based on [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]]'s ''[[Naturalis Historia]]'' and offers no new material.&lt;ref&gt;Hessel Miedema, ''Karel Van Mander's Grondt Der Edel Vry Schilder-Const: ("Foundations of the Noble and Free Art of Painting")'', ''Journal of the History of Ideas'', Vol. 34, No. 4 (Oct. - Dec., 1973), pp. 653-668, Published by: University of Pennsylvania Press&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lives of the modern or contemporary illustrious Italian painters===
Van Mander based this part of the ''Schilder-Boeck'' on Vasari's ''Vite''. The ''Vite'' had been published half a century earlier.  For this reason he only translated about half of Vasari's biographical sketches, and he added Italian artists from his years in Italy, such as [[Tintoretto]] who became known after Vasari's work was published.  Van Mander also purposefully editorialized Vasari's biographies by reinterpreting some of Vasari's material and by adding to Vasari's text with a view to updating it.&lt;ref name=can&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/498003/_Insights_into_the_Dutch_Vasari_Van_Manders_Life_of_Titian_ Amy Golahny, "Insights into the Dutch Vasari: Van Mander's Life of Titian"], In: [[Canadian Journal of Netherlandic Studies]] 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  What follows is a list of Vasari sketches that van Mander translated and included in his work:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0278.htm Index] to the ''Lives of modern Italian painters'' on the [[Digital library for Dutch literature|DBNL]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commentary on the Metamorphoses of Publius Ovidius Nasso===
Van Mander had received a [[Renaissance humanism|humanist training]] and had earlier published a translation of Ovid's ''Metamorphoses''.  In the ''Schilder-Boeck'' he provided a commentary on the ''Metamorphoses''.  Van Mander accepted the Renaissance view that there was no conflict between classical mythology and Old Testament history and that mythology was able to convey evangelical truths and lessons. For instance, the myth of the Titans assaulting Jupiter's throne could be interpreted as an illustration of the Christian dictum that pride is the cause of all evil.  The allegorized interpretation of the [[Metamorphoses]] of Ovid in the Schilder-Boeck is inspired by this Renaissance view of classical mythology.&lt;ref name=ret&gt;Karel van Mander in: Marijke Spies, Ton van Strien and Henk Duits, 'Amsterdam University Press Rhetoric Rhetoricians and Poets, Studies in Renaissance Poetry and Poetics, 1999, p. 93-97&lt;/ref&gt;

This part was well-received and was later sold as a separate book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/mand001schi01_01/mand001schi01_01_0545.htm Index] to the
 ''Explanation of Ovid's Metamorphoses'' on the DBNL&lt;/ref&gt;

===Depiction of figures===
The final book about the depiction of figures contains a list of various animals, birds and other objects that can have meaning for the painter to include in his arrangement. This book includes some pagan rituals for use in historical allegories. Included before the index to the ''Metamorphoses'', it is meant as an extra guide for that book.

==The indexes==
Because the pages are numbered only on the right-hand page, the indexes have an addendum to the page number to indicate the front (recto) or back (verso) of the "folio" to be able to locate text more efficiently. Looking up painters remains difficult because the indexes use first names rather than last names, since the last names in use by the painters themselves were not consistent in all regions where the painters were active. Many painters were better known by their nicknames than their given names. For this reason, the spelling of the names used in the text does not always match the names in the indexes.

==Legacy==
[[File:Karel van Mander - Schilderboeck 2nd edition title page.tiff|thumb|Title page of the second edition of the ''Schilder-Boeck'']]

The ''Schilder-Boeck'' introduced Dutch and Flemish artists to Italian art and encouraged them to travel to Italy.

The ''Schilder-Boeck'' was very influential on art writing in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. [[Cornelis de Bie]] (''Gulden Cabinet'', 1662), [[Joachim von Sandrart]] (''Teutsche Akademie'', 1675), [[Samuel Dirksz van Hoogstraten]] (''Inleyding tot de hooge schoole der schilderkonst'', 1678), [[Filippo Baldinucci]] (''Notizie de' Professori'', 1681) and [[Arnold Houbraken]] (''Schouburg'', 1720) are some of the early biographers who used material from the ''Schilder-Boeck'' for their biographical sketches of Netherlandish painters or as a basis for developing their own art theory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8iL0uoNEJXUC&amp;dq=%22illusionism+in+Dutch+and+Flemish+Art%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s Thijs Weststeijn, 'The Visible World: Samuel Van Hoogstraten's Art Theory and the Legitimation of Painting in the Dutch Golden Age'], Amsterdam University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Lives of the illustrious Netherlandish and German painters'' is the longest book in the ''Schilder-Boeck''. It has historically been and still is the most important book for historians looking for details on (early) Netherlandish painters.&lt;ref name=mel&gt;Walter S. Melion, ''Shaping the Netherlandish Canon: Karel Van Mander's Schilder-Boeck'', University of Chicago Press, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; This book is still the most-cited primary source in biographical accounts of the lives of many artists he included. Of most interest to historians is his criticism of the work of these artists, especially when he describes the painting style, use of color, location and owner of the paintings, thus becoming a valuable source for art [[provenance]].

The ''Schilder-Boeck'' is included in the ''Basic Library'' of the ''dbnl'' ([[Canon of Dutch Literature]]), which contains what its compilers believe to be the 1,000 most important works in Dutch literature from the Middle Ages to today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/basisbibliotheek/index.php?c=17 Website of the ''Basic Library'' of the dbnl, the section on the Golden Age] (in Dutch)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Translation==
The ''Lives of the illustrious Netherlandish and German painters'' was translated into modern Dutch and English by Miedema and published in the 1990s. In his attempt to provide a systematic overview of the ''Lives'', Miedema includes a long list of the sources on which Karel van Mander relied as he did for his own modern translation, and includes prints, photos of paintings, sculpture, architecture and stained glass window cartoons to illustrate the text. He also publishes new archival evidence.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Trinity House, Kirkgate Leith.jpg|thumb|Trinity House, Kirkgate, Leith]]
[[File:Trinity House Maritime Museum - geograph.org.uk - 626296.jpg|thumb|Trinity House, Leith]]
'''Trinity House''', 99 Kirkgate, is a category A [[listed building]]&lt;ref name= "historic scotland"&gt;[http://data.historic-scotland.gov.uk/pls/htmldb/f?p=2200:15:0::::BUILDING:27834 Historic Scotland - Listed Buildings - 99 New Kirkgate, Trinity House]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Leith]], Edinburgh, Scotland, which was a [[guild hall]], [[customs house]], and centre for maritime administration and [[poor relief]]. In the [[Scotland in the Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]] and [[Scotland in the Early Modern Era|Early Modern Era]] it also served as an [[almshouse]] and [[Hospital#Medieval Europe|hospital]]. Now in [[Historic Scotland|state care]], it houses a [[maritime museum]].

Trinity House was the headquarters of the Incorporation of Masters and Mariners, a [[Guild|trade incorporation]] and charitable organisation founded in the 14th century when the shipowners and shipmasters of Leith formed a [[Fraternity]] (from which the name, ''Trinity'', may derive). The present Trinity House is a Category A [[Listed building|listed]] [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]] house, designed by [[Thomas Brown (architect)|Thomas Brown]] and built in 1816-8, using the existing basement and vaults of the former Trinity House and mariners' hospital of 1555.&lt;ref name= "historic scotland" /&gt;

Concerned to improve safety at sea, Trinity House established the first formal [[Seamanship|nautical training]] in the country and licensed [[Maritime pilot|pilot]]s for the [[Firth of Forth|Forth]] and around the [[Geography of Scotland|Scottish coast]]. By collecting Licht Money (light money), by the 17th century they were maintaining primitive coal-fired lights in the Forth. In the 19th century, Trinity House was involved in the planning and funding of new and more reliable [[lighthouse]]s that took advantage of improvements in technology. These included the [[Bell Rock lighthouse]], [[Fidra lighthouse]] and the [[Isle of May lighthouse]].

The Masters and Mariners invested in land, which became known as Trinity Mains, near the village of [[Newhaven, Edinburgh|Newhaven]]. This land later developed into a suburb of Leith and is now the modern-day district of [[Trinity, Edinburgh|Trinity]].

The medieval Incorporation served as a blueprint for the establishment of Trinity Houses in other maritime centres, including Dundee, [[Hull Trinity House|Hull]], [[Trinity House, London|London]] and [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House|Newcastle-upon-Tyne]].

==History==
[[File:Convening Room Trinity House, Leith N wall.JPG|thumb|Convening Room Trinity House]]
The Masters and Mariners of the Trinity House in the Kirkgate was the oldest and wealthiest of the [[trade guild]]s of Leith. The guilds were divided into four groups:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricscotland.com/history/leith/11.htm The Story of Leith - The Trade Guilds of Leith]&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Sea captain|skipper]]s and [[Sailor|mariner]]s of the Trinity House
# [[Maltman|maltmen]], [[brewer]]s, and [[sled]]ders or [[cart]]ers
# [[Artisan|craftsmen]] and meal men (''[[Cereal|corn merchants]]'')
# traffickers (''[[merchant]]s''), and all other gentlemen and residents of Leith not members of any of the other corporations

In 1380 [[Robert II of Scotland|King Robert II]] granted the Incorporation of Master and Mariners of Leith the right to levy a [[Duty (economics)|duty]], called prime gilt, of 12 [[Scottish coinage|pennies]] on each [[ton]] of goods landed at Leith. An additional voluntary contribution, called crown money, was also collected. Trade was largely conducted over the [[North Sea]], with the [[Nordic countries|Nordic]] and [[Baltic region]]s, the [[Low Countries]] and France. The funds raised by the prime gilt and crown money were then used for the [[Poor relief|relief]] of the sick, the poor and the widows and orphans of lost or captured mariners; and to care for aged mariners.

In 1555 the Incorporation had sufficient funds to build a hospital at the Kirkgate. The basement of this building survives under the current Trinity House.

Following a series of disputes over payments, in 1566 [[Mary Queen of Scots]] confirmed the right of the Incorporation to collect payments: ratifying "the gift, foundation, erection and institution of the hospital and of the prime gilt". Refusal to pay would result in the [[confiscation]] of sails and anchor.

In 1680, funded by fees and by a levy on Leith shipmasters, the Masters and Mariners appointed a professor to teach the mathematics of navigation to the sons and apprentices of shipmasters. This training for future officers was subsequently extended across Scotland.

On 29 June 1797 the Corporation of the Trinity House of Leith was granted a [[royal charter]].

As a result of the requirement for formal qualifications stipulated in the [[Merchant Seamen Act 1844]], in 1855 Trinity House and other Leith organisations founded the Leith Navigational School (also called the Government Navigation School), based at a room at [[St Ninian's Church, Leith|St Ninian's Church]] (also called the Mariners' Church), on Commercial Street. In 1903 Leith Navigation School came under the control of the [[Scottish Education Department]], and the name was changed to [[Leith Nautical College]] (since merged to become part of [[Jewel &amp; Esk College]], which in 2012 merged to become [[Edinburgh College]]).

Prime gilt was abolished in 1862, so Trinity House had to depend on property income to meet pension payments.

Currently Trinity House is in the care of [[Historic Environment Scotland]].

The '''type–token distinction''' is used in disciplines such as [[logic]], [[linguistics]], [[metalogic]], [[typography]], and [[computer programming]] to clarify what words mean.

==Overview==
The sentence "''they drive the same car''" is ambiguous. Do they drive the same ''type'' of car (the same model) or the same instance of a car type (a single vehicle)? Clarity requires us to distinguish words that represent abstract types from words that represent objects that embody or exemplify types. The type–token distinction separates types (abstract descriptive concepts) from tokens (objects that instantiate concepts).

For example: "bicycle" represents a type: the concept of a bicycle; whereas "my bicycle" represents a token of that type: an object that instantiates that type. In the sentence "the bicycle is becoming more popular" the word "bicycle" represents a type that is a concept; whereas in the sentence "the bicycle is in the garage" the word "bicycle" represents a token: a particular object.

(The distinction in [[computer programming]] between [[class (software)|classes]] and [[object (computer science)|objects]] is related, though in this context, "class" sometimes refers to a set of objects (with class-level attribute or operations) rather than a description of an object in the set, as "type" would.)

The words type, concept, property, quality, feature and attribute (all used in describing things) tend to be used with different verbs. E.g. Suppose a rose bush is defined as a plant that is "thorny", "flowering" and "bushy". You might say a rose bush ''instantiates'' these three types, or ''embodies'' these three concepts, or ''exhibits'' these three properties, or ''possesses'' these three qualities, features or attributes.

Property types (e.g "height in metres" or "thorny") are often understood [[ontology|ontologically]] as concepts. Property instances (e.g. height = 1.74) are sometimes understood as measured values, and sometimes understood as sensations or observations of reality.

Some say types exist in descriptions of objects, but not as tangible [[physical object]]s. They say one can show someone a particular bicycle, but cannot show someone the type "bicycle", as in "''the bicycle'' is popular.". However types do exist in the sense that they appear in mental and documented models.

Some say tokens are objects that are tangible, exist in space and time as physical matter and/or energy. However, tokens can be intangible objects of types such as "thought", "tennis match", "government" and "act of kindness".

== Occurrences ==
There is a related distinction very closely connected with the type-token distinction. This distinction is the distinction between an object, or type of object, and an '''''occurrence''''' of it. In this sense, an occurrence is not necessarily a token. Considering the sentence: "[[A rose is a rose is a rose]]". We may equally correctly state that there are eight or three words in the sentence. There are, in fact, three word types in the sentence: "rose", "is" and "a". There are eight word tokens in a token copy of the line. The line itself is a type. There are not eight word types in the line. It contains (as stated) only the three word types, 'a', 'is' and 'rose', each of which is unique. So what do we call what there are eight of? They are occurrences of words. There are three occurrences of the word type 'a', two of 'is' and three of 'rose'.

The need to distinguish tokens of types from occurrences of types arises, not just in linguistics, but whenever types of things have other types of things occurring in them.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ''[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/types-tokens Types and Tokens]''&lt;/ref&gt; Reflection on the simple case of occurrences of [[numeral system|numerals]] is often helpful.{{citation needed|date=January 2017|reason=Claim made with no support or citation, term used without definition.}}

== Typography ==
In [[typography]], the type–token distinction is used to determine the presence of a text printed by [[movable type]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Herbert E. Brekle|Brekle, Herbert E.]]: ''Die Prüfeninger Weiheinschrift von 1119. Eine paläographisch-typographische Untersuchung'', Scriptorium Verlag für Kultur und Wissenschaft, Regensburg 2005, {{ISBN|3-937527-06-0}}, p.&amp;nbsp;23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The defining criteria which a typographic print has to fulfill is that of the type identity of the various [[letter form]]s which make up the printed text. In other words: each letter form which appears in the text has to be shown as a particular instance ("token") of one and the same type which contains a reverse image of the printed [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]].}}

== Charles Sanders Peirce ==
:''There are only 26 letters in the [[English alphabet]] and yet there are more than 26 letters in this [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letters have been created.''

The word 'letters' was used three times in the above paragraph, each time in a different meaning. The word 'letters' is one of many words having "type–token ambiguity". This section disambiguates 'letters' by separating the three senses using terminology standard in logic today. The key distinctions were first made by the American logician-philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] in 1906 using terminology that he established.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sanders Peirce, Prolegomena to an apology for pragmaticism, Monist, vol.16 (1906), pp. 492–546.&lt;/ref&gt;

The letters that are created by writing are physical objects that can be destroyed by various means: these are letter TOKENS or letter INSCRIPTIONS. The 26 letters of the alphabet are letter TYPES or letter FORMS.

'''Peirce's type–token distinction''', also applies to words, sentences, paragraphs, and so on: to anything in a universe of discourse of character-string theory, or [[concatenation theory]]. There is only one word type spelled el-ee-tee-tee-ee-ar,&lt;ref&gt;Using a variant of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s structural-descriptive naming found in [[John Corcoran (logician)|John Corcoran]], [https://philarchive.org/archive/CORSTC Schemata: the Concept of Schema in the History of Logic], Bulletin of Symbolic Logic, vol. 12 (2006), pp. 219–40.&lt;/ref&gt; namely, 'letter'; but every time that word type is written, a new word token has been created.

Some logicians consider a word type to be the class of its tokens. Other logicians counter that the word type has a permanence and constancy not found in the class of its tokens. The type remains the same while the class of its tokens is continually gaining new members and losing old members.

The word type 'letter' uses only four letter types: el, ee, tee, and ar. Nevertheless, it uses ee twice and tee twice. In standard terminology, the word type 'letter' has six letter OCCURRENCES and the letter type ee OCCURS twice in the word type 'letter'. Whenever a word type is inscribed, the number of letter tokens created equals the number of letter occurrences in the word type.

Peirce's original words are the following.
"A common mode of estimating the amount of matter in a ... printed book is to count the number of words. There will ordinarily be about twenty 'thes' on a page, and, of course, they count as twenty words. In another sense of the word 'word,' however, there is but one word 'the' in the English language; and it is impossible that this word should lie visibly on a page, or be heard in any voice .... Such a ... Form, I propose to term a Type. A Single ... Object ... such as this or that word on a single line of a single page of a single copy of a book, I will venture to call a Token. .... In order that a Type may be used, it has to be embodied in a Token which shall be a sign of the Type, and thereby of the object the Type signifies." – Peirce 1906, Ogden-Richards, 1923, 280-1.

These distinctions are subtle but solid and easy to master. This section ends using the new terminology to disambiguate the first paragraph.

:''There are 26 letter types in the English alphabet and yet there are more than 26 letter occurrences in this sentence type. Moreover, every time a child writes the alphabet 26 new letter tokens have been created.''

==History==
The program has its roots in the Library Science Program at the Armour Institute of Chicago created in September 1893 as part of the strong cultural movement following the [[Industrial Revolution]] to professionally educate men and women for the upcoming twentieth century and for the technical world.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The public library had come to be seen by most as a "university of the people," and those who were to become the "best librarians" were those formally educated in the trade.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Seeking a director, Gunsaulus, the president of the Institute, asked Melvil Dewey to recommend the best person for the job. Dewey recommended [[Katharine Sharp]], who was finishing up her library science degree program in Dewey's school in Albany, NY.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Once established, the school became the only library science program in the Midwest and the fourth in the United States.

Sharp, in turn, became the library school: "Her enthusiasm, her drive, and her unswerving dedication were the determining factors for the school during its formative years in Chicago as well as the following ten years when she directed the Illinois State Library School on the Urbana-Champaign campus." &lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 6-7&lt;/ref&gt; The school in Chicago, operating off of a technical institute model, began taking on a university structure under Sharp's leadership. The Armour facility did not provide enough collection or classroom space that was needed, and finances were becoming tight. The University of Illinois and the University of Wisconsin were interested in the program, and both universities offered to accept Sharp's program. Sharp chose the University of Illinois, and the program moved to Urbana.&lt;ref&gt;Grotzinger 1992, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial location for the library science program was in [[Altgeld Hall]] where it remained until 1926. It then moved to the Main Library for the next fifty three years until 1979. The program then relocated to David Kinley Hall until 1993. An additional relocation went underway when the University purchased property from [[Acacia Fraternity]]'s Illinois Heth chapter and moved the school to its current location at Fifth and Daniel Streets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rushacacia.com/History&lt;/ref&gt;

The school officially changed its name from the Graduate School of Library and Information Science (GSLIS) to the School of Information Sciences in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;http://ischool.illinois.edu/articles/2015/10/faculty-vote-favor-name-change-proposal&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The school is located on the corner of Fifth and Daniel streets in Champaign, Illinois. It is situated next to the Department of Speech and Hearing Science and across the street from the Department of Psychology. The building was formerly the location of the [[Acacia Fraternity]] and still has functional showers for both men and women along with three kitchens. A computer lab, known as the Learning Resource Lab (LRL), is located in the basement and available for student use 24/7 with card access. Other areas, such as the second floor lounge and the doctoral student area, serve as study spots for students. Wireless Internet access is also available in all public areas, and technology support is provided by the department's Help Desk on the second floor. The Help Desk is staffed by current iSchool master's students.

The building is also in close proximity to many campus libraries. The University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, one of three campuses of the University of Illinois system, has over 40 libraries; their combined holdings are among the largest in the United States and the world. One such library, The Center for Children's Books, which houses more than 16,000 youth trade books, is located on the bottom floor of the iSchool building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ccb.lis.illinois.edu/aboutus.html | date=2014-11-27 | title=Center for Children's Books - About Us | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141204173206/http://ccb.lis.illinois.edu/aboutus.html | archivedate=2014-12-04 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
