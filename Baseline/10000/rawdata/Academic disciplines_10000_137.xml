The Aesthetic-Usability Effect describes a paradox that people perceive more [[aesthetic]] designs as much more intuitive, than those considered to be less aesthetically pleasing. The effect has been observed in several experiments and has significant implications regarding the acceptance, use, and performance of a design. Usability and aesthetics are the two most important factors in assessing the overall [[user experience]] for an application. [[Usability]] and [[aesthetics]] are judged by a user's reuse expectations, and then their post-use, or experienced, final judgement. A user's [[cognitive style]] can influence how they interact with and perceive an application, which in turn can influence their judgement of said application.

== History==
Masaaki Kurosu and Kaori Kashimura, researchers at Hitachi in Tokyo, demonstrated the aesthetic-usability effect in their study. The results of the analysis show that “the apparent usability is less correlated with the inherent usability compared to the apparent beauty. ... This suggests that the user may be strongly affected by the aesthetic aspect of the interface even when they try to evaluate the interface in its functional aspects, and it is suggested that the interface designers should strive not only to improve the inherent usability but also brush up the apparent usability or the aesthetic aspect of the interface.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kurosu|first1=Masaaki|title=Apparent usability vs. inherent usability: experimental analysis on the determinants of the apparent usability|journal=CHI '95 Conference Companion on Human Factors in Computing Systems|pages=292–293}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, aesthetic usability effect play an important role in user experience.

== The aesthetics factor==
The aesthetics factor was manipulated by differing in terms of color combination, visual layout, and text font, which determine the level of aesthetics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Sangwon|last2=Koubeka|first2=Richard J.|year=2011|title=The Impact of Cognitive Style on User Preference Based on Usability and Aesthetics for Computer-Based Systems|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10447318.2011.555320|journal=International Journal of Human–Computer Interaction|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the study by Hall and Hanna, users perceived websites with white–black and black–white color combinations as less pleasing and stimulating than ones with non-grayscale color combinations. A few previous studies Kurosu &amp; Kashimura (1995) Tractinsky (1997) Tractinsky ( 2000) demonstrated a significant effect of visual layout on perceived aesthetics in experiments with Automated Teller Machine (ATM) layouts with different arrangements of content items.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Human-computer Interaction and Management Information Systems: Foundations|last=Zhang|first=Yahong|last2=Zhang|first2=Ping|last3=Galletta|first3=Dennis F.|publisher=Routledge, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2006|isbn=978-0-7656-1486-5|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an experiment using home robotic control systems, Conklin (2006) showed that the manipulation of interface aesthetics with the use of color, layout, and font style was successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conklin|first=S. M.|last2=Koubek|first2=R. J.|last3=Thurman|first3=J. A.|last4=Newman|first4=L. C.|year=2006|title=The effects of aesthetics and cognitive style on perceived usability.|url=|journal=Proceedings of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society Annual Meeting|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, McCracken and Wolfe (2004) recommended using of Georgia or Verdana font styles not intermixed in the body text of a website rather than Times New Roman or Arial intermixed in the body text.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=User-centered Website Development: A Human-computer Interaction Approach|last=McCracken|first=Daniel D.|last2=Jean Wolfe|first2=Rosalee|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2004|isbn=9780130411617|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The effect of cognitive style==
Cognitive style is a characteristic of the user determined by the [[Cognitive styles analysis|Cognitive Styles Analysis (CSA)]].The interface and functional features of an application can be harmonized or non-harmonized in accordance with a user's cognitive style. Cognitive styles could be classified into two groups of people-imager and verbalizer, or [[Cognitive style#Multi-dimensional models and measures|the Wholist-Analytic and the Verbal-Imagery]] dimension. So an application success might vary, depending on how it caters to individual cognitive style. Imagers are more influenced by aesthetics factor and tends to utilize the aesthetics features in understanding and using an application. In 2011, Sangwon Lee and Richard J. Koubeks&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; showed results that the effect of aesthetics factor on pre-use preference was significantly different based on cognitive styles. There were significant differences in the pre-use preference of the changing aesthetics but not between the two types of cognitive styles of the test subjects. The same applied to the pre-use usability factor of the application as well. There was little difference in the effect of aesthetics on Wholist-Analytic versus Verbal-Imagery. This may be surprising considering that imagers think in pictures (visually), versus verbalizers who think in words. The effect of usability on the time performance was not significantly different between the two groups.

== Cultural aesthetics for user interface design==
Usability and aesthetics are two important factions for designing user interfaces. Thus, with the Internet being increasingly strong in the national marketplace, it is unreasonable to design a single common website for everyone and to expect it to attract the international audiences with the same aesthetic interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reineche|first=Katharina|last2=Bernstein|first2=Abraham|year=2011|title=Improving Performance, Perceived Usability, and Aesthetics with Culturally Adaptive User Interface|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1970382|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction (TOCHI)|volume=18|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; What users perceive as beautiful and usable strongly depends on their cultural background. Thus, the cultural aesthetics is a reasonable way to improve user interfaces and Cultural Adaptivity is a way to increase that. The idea is that websites automatically compose personalised interfaces based on the individual cultural backgrounds of its users; this is a deep understanding of the term culture.
There are several different factors of defining the user's cultural background, such as the user's first language, religion, the education level and the form of education and the social or political norm of the culture .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nisbett|first1=Richard|title=The Geography of Thought: How Asians and Westerners Think Differently...and Why|date=2003|publisher=Free Press|location=Now York|isbn=978-0743255356}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sail|first1=Haytham|last2=M. Okeefe|first2=Robert|last3=S.Hone|first3=Kate|title=The impact of religious affiliation on trust in the context of electronic commerce. Interacting with Computers|date=February 2004|pages=7–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Salome|first1=Schmid-isler|title=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences|date=5 January 2000|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|location=Los Alamitos, California, USA|isbn=0-7695-0493-0|url=https://www.alexandria.unisg.ch/11938/}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of those factors are very important aspects of defining the cultures of users and influencing the aesthetic direction of users.

== The influence of design aesthetics in usability testing==
Aesthetics designs are more effective at fostering positive attitudes than unaesthetic designs, and make people more tolerant of design problems. The design aesthetics is employed in two ways: it may refer to the objective features of a stimulus or to the subjective reaction to the specific product features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lidwell|first1=William|last2=Holden|first2=Kritina|last3=Butler|first3=Jill|title=Universal Principles of Design|date=2003|publisher=Rockport| isbn=9781592530076|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Universal_Principles_of_Design.html?id=e4AaWB3QX6cC}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A study between two functionally identical mobile phones with highly appealing visual appearance not appealing visual appearance to determine the influence of appearance on perceived usability, performance measures and perceived attractiveness. The data confirmed that the aesthetically appealing prototype was rated significantly more attractive than the unappealing prototype. Furthermore, an interaction between prototype and product usage was found, showing an increase in the perceived attractiveness rating of the aesthetically appealing prototype after product usage whereas the attractiveness-rating of the unappealing prototype decreased after product usage. The main effect of product usage (before vs. after) was not significant. The results showed that participants using the highly appealing phone rated their appliance as being more usable than participants operating the unappealing model. Furthermore, the visual appearance of the phone had a positive effect on performance, leading to reduced task completion times for the attractive model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Andreas|last1=Sonderegger|first2=Juergen|last2=Sauer|title=The influence of design aesthetics in usability testing: Effects on user performance and perceived usability|journal=Applied Ergonomics|date=2010|volume=4|issue=3|pages=403–410|url=https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&amp;hl=en&amp;user=4DQsjnwAAAAJ&amp;citation_for_view=4DQsjnwAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shariah Advisory Council===
[[File:SAC Banner.jpg|thumb|Shariah Advisory Council Banner]]
The Arab Chamber established the first [[Shariah Advisory Council]] in Hong Kong, made up of experts in the Islamic code of law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=1&amp;art_id=55142&amp;sid=15756465&amp;con_type=1 SAR shariah council formed - The Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016011810/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=1&amp;art_id=55142&amp;sid=15756465&amp;con_type=1 |date=2012-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was established because of the great of [[Shariah]] compliance of banking services, financial products, and commercial establishments requiring compliance supervision and regulation, and the lack of services that was provided in Hong Kong and China. The Shariah Advisory Council, established by The Chamber, filled that gap and to this day has provided council and regulation for many establishments throughout Hong Kong and China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabianbusiness.com/hk-s-islamic-new-year-191901.html HK’s Islamic New Year - Banking &amp; Finance - ArabianBusiness.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong Islamic Index===
The '''HK Islamic Index''' (HKII), was established in 2007 by the Chamber to support Hong Kong's ambitions to develop into an [[Shariah]] compliant, [[Islamic banking]] and financial centre and was the first time a chamber of commerce had taken the initiative to create its own equity index. Reuters, Bloomberg, and Quamnet have been contracted to disseminate the HK Islamic Index. The HKII comprises 78 companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, with 39 each from Hong Kong and mainland China. The Hong Kong Islamic Index was valued at [[HK$]]1,419 as of 20 June 2011. Stocks under the index are listed from the Real Estate, Transportation, Information Technology, Industrial Goods, Utilities, Energy, Material, Telecommunications, or Consumer Goods sectors.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.quamnet.com/markets.action?showIndice=HKII Quamnet.com Stock Markets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hkislamicindex.com/constituents.htm HK Islamic Index Limited&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Amwal Credit Union===
[[File:ACU Logo.jpg|thumb|ACU Logo]]
The Arab Chamber of Commerce and Industry recognised that when The Chamber was established there was a lack of Islamic Banking in Hong Kong and China. In 2009 it established the '''Amwal Credit Union''', which would provide [[Shariah]] compliant, Islamic banking and finance based on the core principles of community and individual responsibility, environmental responsibility, and Islamically permissible banking practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amwalcreditunion.org/index_welcome_extended.html AmwalCreditUnion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=16&amp;art_id=78214&amp;sid=22728450&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20090216&amp;fc=1 Credit crunch opens doors for other possibilities - The Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016012013/http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?we_cat=16&amp;art_id=78214&amp;sid=22728450&amp;con_type=1&amp;d_str=20090216&amp;fc=1 |date=October 16, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Astroinformatics''' is an interdisciplinary field of study involving the combination of [[astronomy]], [[data science]], [[informatics]], and [[Information technology|information]]/[[Communications technologies|communications]] technologies.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;&lt;ref name=pdf&gt;[http://www.math.bas.bg/~nkirov/zip/SEEDI_astro_presentation.pdf Astroinformatics and digitization of astronomical heritage], Nikolay Kirov. The fifth SEEDI International Conference Digitization of cultural and scientific heritage, May 19–20, 2010, Sarajevo. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Astroinformatics is primarily focused on developing the tools, methods, and applications of [[computational science]], [[data science]], and [[statistics]] for research and education in data-oriented astronomy.&lt;ref name="astroinfo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk D. |title=Astroinformatics: data-oriented astronomy research and education |journal=Earth Science Informatics |date=12 May 2010 |volume=3 |issue=1–2 |pages=5–17 |doi=10.1007/s12145-010-0055-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts in this direction included [[data exploration|data discovery]], [[metadata standards]] development, [[data modeling]], astronomical [[data dictionary]] development, [[data access]], [[information retrieval]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Science User Scenarios for a Virtual Observatory Design Reference Mission: Science Requirements for Data Mining|eprint=astro-ph/0008307|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[data integration]], and [[data mining]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Kargupta |editor-first1=Hillol |display-editors=etal |title=Next generation of data mining |date=2008 |location=London |isbn=9781420085860 |last1=Borne |first1=Kirk|chapter=Scientific Data Mining in Astronomy |publisher=CRC Press |pages=91–114}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the astronomical [[Virtual Observatory]] initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1117/12.487536|chapter=Distributed data mining in the National Virtual Observatory|title=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|volume=5098|pages=211|series=Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery: Theory, Tools, and Technology V|year=2003|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VOdm" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laurino |first1=O. |last2=D’Abrusco |first2=R. |last3=Longo |first3=G. |last4=Riccio |first4=G. |title=Astroinformatics of galaxies and quasars: a new general method for photometric redshifts estimation |journal=Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society |date=21 December 2011 |volume=418 |issue=4 |pages=2165–2195 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2966.2011.19416.x|arxiv=1107.3160 |bibcode=2011MNRAS.418.2165L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further development of the field, along with astronomy community endorsement, was presented to the [[National Research Council (United States)]] in 2009 in the Astroinformatics "State of the Profession" Position Paper for the 2010 [[Astronomy and Astrophysics Decadal Survey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: A 21st Century Approach to Astronomy|eprint = 0909.3892 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That position paper provided the basis for the subsequent more detailed exposition of the field in the Informatics Journal paper ''Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy Research and Education''.&lt;ref name="astroinfo" /&gt;

Astroinformatics as a distinct field of research was inspired by work in the fields of [[Bioinformatics]] and [[Geoinformatics]], and through the [[eScience]] work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Online Science'|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/gray/JimGrayTalks.htm|website=Talks by Jim Gray|publisher=Microsoft Research|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)]] at [[Microsoft Research]], whose legacy was remembered and continued through the Jim Gray eScience Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jim Gray eScience Award|url=http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/collaboration/focus/escience/jim-gray-award.aspx|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the primary focus of Astroinformatics is on the large worldwide distributed collection of digital astronomical databases, image archives, and research tools, the field recognizes the importance of legacy data sets as well—using modern technologies to preserve and analyze historical astronomical observations. Some Astroinformatics practitioners help to [[Digital data|digitize]] historical and recent astronomical observations and images in a large [[database]] for efficient retrieval through [[World wide web|web]]-based interfaces.&lt;ref name=pdf/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casca.ca/lrp2010/Docs/LRPReports/astroinformatics_lrp.pdf Astroinformatics in Canada], Nicholas M. Ball, David Schade. Retrieved 1 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Another aim is to help develop new methods and software for astronomers, as well as to help facilitate the process and analysis of the rapidly growing amount of data in the field of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Astroinformatics' helps Astronomers explore the sky|url=http://phys.org/news/2013-10-astroinformatics-astronomers-exploring-sky.html|website=Phys.org|publisher=Heidelberg University|accessdate=11 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics is described as the "Fourth Paradigm" of astronomical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fourth Paradigm: Data-Intensive Scientific Discovery|url=https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/fourth-paradigm-data-intensive-scientific-discovery/|website=Microsoft Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many research areas involved with astroinformatics, such as data mining, machine learning, statistics, visualization, scientific data management, and semantic science.&lt;ref name="VOdm"&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-94-007-5618-2_9|chapter=Virtual Observatories, Data Mining, and Astroinformatics|title=Planets, Stars and Stellar Systems|pages=403|year=2013|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|isbn=978-94-007-5617-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data mining]] and [[machine learning]] play significant roles in Astroinformatics as a [[Scientific method|scientific research]] discipline due to their focus on "knowledge discovery from data" ([[data mining|KDD]]) and "learning from data".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Ball |first1=N.M. |last2=Brunner |first2=R.J. |title=Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=1049 |doi=10.1142/S0218271810017160 |year=2010|arxiv=0906.2173 |bibcode=2010IJMPD..19.1049B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1063/1.3059074 |chapter=The LSST Data Mining Research Agenda |title=AIP Conference Proceedings |pages=347 |year=2008 |last1=Borne |first1=K |last2=Becla |first2=J |last3=Davidson |first3=I |last4=Szalay |first4=A |last5=Tyson |first5=J. A |last6=Bailer-Jones |first6=Coryn A.L|arxiv=0811.0167 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of data collected from astronomical sky surveys has grown from gigabytes to terabytes throughout the past decade and is predicted to grow in the next decade into hundreds of petabytes with the [[Large Synoptic Survey Telescope]] and into the exabytes with the [[Square Kilometre Array]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1063/1.3059076|chapter=Parametrization and Classification of 20 Billion LSST Objects: Lessons from SDSS|title=AIP Conference Proceedings|pages=359|year=2008|last1=Ivezić|first1=Ž|last2=Axelrod|first2=T|last3=Becker|first3=A.

A|last21=Bailer-Jones|first21=Coryn A.L|arxiv=0810.5155}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plethora of new data both enables and challenges effective astronomical research. Therefore, new approaches are required. In part due to this, data-driven science is becoming a recognized academic discipline. Consequently, astronomy (and other scientific disciplines) are developing information-intensive and data-intensive sub-disciplines to an extent that these sub-disciplines are now becoming (or have already become) standalone research disciplines and full-fledged academic programs. While many institutes of education do not boast an astroinformatics program, such programs most likely will be developed in the near future.

[[Informatics]] has been recently defined as "the use of digital data, information, and related services for research and knowledge generation". However the usual, or commonly used definition is "informatics is the discipline of organizing, accessing, integrating, and mining data from multiple sources for discovery and decision support." Therefore, the discipline of astroinformatics includes many naturally-related specialties including data modeling, data organization, etc. It may also include transformation and normalization methods for data integration and information visualization, as well as knowledge extraction, indexing techniques, information retrieval and data mining methods. Classification schemes (e.g., [[taxonomy (general)|taxonomies]], [[ontology (information science)|ontologies]], [[folksonomy|folksonomies]], and/or collaborative [[Tag (metadata)|tagging]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Collaborative Annotation for Scientific Data Discovery and Reuse|url=http://www.asis.org/Bulletin/Apr-13/AprMay13_RDAP_Borne.html|website=Bulletin of the ASIS&amp;T|publisher=American Society for Information Science and Technology|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;) plus [[Astrostatistics]] will also be heavily involved. [[Citizen science]] projects (such as [[Galaxy Zoo]]) also contribute highly valued novelty discovery, feature meta-tagging, and object characterization within large astronomy data sets. All of these specialties enable scientific discovery across varied massive data collections, collaborative research, and data re-use, in both research and learning environments.

In 2012, two position papers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astroinformatics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Feigelson|first1=Eric|title=Astrostatistics in a Nutshell|url=https://asaip.psu.edu/Articles/astrostatistics-in-a-nutshell|website=asaip.psu.edu|publisher=The Astrostatistics and Astroinformatics Portal, Penn State University|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; were presented to the Council of the [[American Astronomical Society]] that led to the establishment of formal working groups in Astroinformatics and [[Astrostatistics]] for the profession of [[astronomy]] within the US and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv|last1=Feigelson|first1=E.|last2=Ivezić|first2=Ž.|last3=Hilbe|first3=J.|last4=Borne|first4=K.|title=New Organizations to Support Astroinformatics and Astrostatistics|eprint=1301.3069|class=astro-ph.IM|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Astroinformatics provides a natural context for the integration of education and research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=The Revolution in Astronomy Education: Data Science for the Masses|eprint = 0909.3895 |class=astro-ph.IM|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experience of research can now be implemented within the classroom to establish and grow [[data literacy]] through the easy re-use of data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using Data in the Classroom|url=http://serc.carleton.edu/usingdata/index.html|website=Science Education Resource Center at Carleton College|publisher=National Science Digital Library|accessdate=11 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has many other uses, such as repurposing archival data for new projects, literature-data links, intelligent retrieval of information, and many others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borne|first1=Kirk|title=Astroinformatics: Data-Oriented Astronomy|location=George Mason University, USA|url=http://www.iccs-meeting.org/iccs2009/PosterPapers/Poster-paper18.pdf|accessdate=January 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''astrophysical maser''' is a naturally occurring source of [[Stimulated emission|stimulated]] [[spectral line]] emission, typically in the [[microwave]] portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This emission may arise in [[molecular cloud]]s, [[comet]]s, [[planet]]ary [[atmosphere]]s, [[stellar atmosphere]]s, or  various other conditions in [[interstellar space]].

==Background==
{{main|maser}}

===Discrete transition energy===
Like a [[laser]], the emission from a [[maser]] is [[Stimulated emission|stimulated]] (or ''seeded'') and monochromatic, having the [[frequency]] [[Max Planck|corresponding]] to the [[energy]] difference between two [[Quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] energy levels of the species in the gain medium which have been [[Laser pumping|pumped]] into a [[Statistical mechanics|non-thermal]] [[Population inversion|population distribution]]. However, naturally occurring masers lack the [[resonance|resonant]] [[Cavity resonator|cavity]] engineered for terrestrial laboratory masers. The emission from an astrophysical maser is due to a single pass through the gain medium and therefore generally lacks the spatial [[Coherence (physics)|coherence]] and [[Normal mode|mode]] purity expected from a laboratory maser.

===Nomenclature===
Due to the differences between engineered and naturally occurring masers, it is often stated &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springerlink.com/content/n823360t68138811/ Masers, Lasers and the Interstellar Medium], Vladimir Strelnitski 1997, Astrophysics and Space Science, vol. 252, pp. 279-287&lt;/ref&gt; that astrophysical masers are not "true" masers because they lack an oscillation cavity. The distinction between oscillator-based ''[[Laser#Terminology|laser]]s'' and single-pass ''lasers'' was intentionally disregarded by the laser community in the early years of the technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/openbook/030908699X/html/202.html Biographical Memoirs V.83], [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]]&lt;/ref&gt;

This fundamental incongruency in language has resulted in the use of other paradoxical definitions in the field. For example, if the gain medium of a (misaligned) laser is emission-seeded but non-oscillating radiation, it is said to emit [[amplified spontaneous emission]] or ''ASE''. This ASE is regarded as unwanted or parasitic (some researchers would add to this definition the presence of insufficient [[feedback]] or unmet [[lasing threshold]]): that is, the users wish the system to behave as a laser. The emission from astrophysical masers is, in fact, ASE but is sometimes termed [[superradiant emission]] to differentiate it from the laboratory phenomenon. This simply adds to the confusion, since both sources are superradiant. In some laboratory lasers, such as a single pass through a [[Regenerative circuit|regeneratively]] amplified [[Ti-sapphire laser|Ti:Sapph]] stage, the physics is directly analogous to an amplified ray in an astrophysical maser.

Furthermore, the practical limits of the use of the ''m'' to stand for ''microwave'' in ''maser'' are variously employed. For example, when lasers were initially developed in the visible portion of the spectrum they were called ''optical masers.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://prola.aps.org/abstract/PR/v112/i6/p1940_1 Infrared and Optical Masers], A. L. Schawlow and C. H. Townes 1958 Physical Review 112, 1940&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Townes|Townes]] advocated that the ''m'' stand for ''molecule'' since energy states of molecules generally provide the masing transition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/physics/laureates/1964/townes-lecture.pdf C. H. Townes] [[Nobel Prize]] lecture&lt;/ref&gt; Along these lines, some will use the term ''laser'' to describe any system which exploits an electronic transition and the term ''maser'' to describe a system which exploits a [[Rotational transition|rotational]] or [[Vibrational transition|vibrational]] transition, regardless of the output frequency. Some [[astrophysicist]]s use the term ''iraser'' to describe a maser emitting at a [[wavelength]] of a few [[micrometre]]s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/119074614/HTMLSTART?CRETRY=1&amp;SRETRY=0 An ISO survey of possible water and hydroxyl IRASER transitions towards the star-forming regions W49, W3(OH) and Sgr B2M], M. D. Gray and J. A. Yates 1999 [[Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society]] 310, 1153&lt;/ref&gt; even though the [[optics]] community has similar sources which they call lasers. The term ''taser'' has been used to describe laboratory masers in the [[Terahertz radiation|terahertz]] regime&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=APPLAB000065000015001865000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes TASERs: Possible dc pumped terahertz lasers using interwell transitions in semiconductor heterostructures], A. N. Korotkov, D. V. Averin, and K. K. Likharev 1994 Applied Physics Letters 65, 1865&lt;/ref&gt; although [[astronomer]]s might call these ''sub-millimeter masers'' and laboratory [[physicist]]s generally call these ''gas lasers'' or specifically ''[[ethanol|alcohol]] lasers'' in reference to the gain species. The [[electrical engineering]] community typically limits the use of the word microwave to frequencies roughly between 1&amp;nbsp;[[GHz]] and 300&amp;nbsp;GHz, that is wavelengths between 1&amp;nbsp;mm and 33&amp;nbsp;cm.

===Astrophysical conditions===
The simple existence of a pumped population inversion is not sufficient for the observation of a maser. For example, there must be velocity coherence along the line of sight so that Doppler shifting does not prevent inverted states in different parts of the gain medium from radiatively coupling. Also, while [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] in laboratory lasers and masers may be achieved by selectively oscillating the desired modes, polarisation in natural masers will only arise in the presence of a polarisation-state dependent pump or of a [[magnetic field]] in the gain medium. Finally, the radiation from astrophysical masers can be quite weak and may escape detection due to the limited sensitivity (and relative remoteness) of astronomical observatories and due to the sometimes overwhelming spectral absorption from unpumped molecules of the maser species in the surrounding space. This latter obstacle may be partially surmounted through the judicious use of the spatial filtering inherent in [[interferometry|interferometric]] techniques, especially [[very long baseline interferometry]] (VLBI).

The major use of maser study is that they give valuable information on the conditions in space, such as temperature, number density, magnetic field, and velocity, in the most interesting of environments — including stellar birth and death, and the centres of galaxies containing [[black hole]]s.{{ref|11}}{{ref|12}} The conditions involved in these events still need more accurate measuring so that theoretical models can be refined or revised.

==Discovery==

===Historical background===
In 1965 an unexpected discovery was made by Weaver ''et al.'':{{ref|1}} emission lines in space, of unknown origin, at a frequency of 1665&amp;nbsp;MHz. At this time many researchers still thought that molecules could not exist in space, and so the emission was at first attributed to an unknown form of interstellar matter named ''Mysterium'', but the emission was soon identified as line emission from OH molecules in compact sources within molecular clouds.{{ref|2}} More discoveries followed, with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emission in 1969,{{ref|3}} CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH emission in 1970{{ref|5}} and SiO emission in 1974,{{ref|4}} all coming from within molecular clouds. These were termed "masers", as from their narrow line-widths and high effective temperatures it became clear that these sources were amplifying microwave radiation.

Masers were then discovered around highly evolved [[Late-type star]]s (named [[OH/IR star]]s). First was OH emission in 1968,{{ref|6}} then H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O emission in 1969{{ref|7}} and SiO emission in 1974.{{ref|8}} Masers were also discovered in external galaxies in 1973,{{ref|9}} and in the [[Solar System]] in comet halos.

Another unexpected discovery was made in 1982 with the discovery of emission from an extra-galactic source with an unrivalled luminosity about 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; times larger than any previous source.{{ref|10}} This was termed a ''[[megamaser]]'' because of its great luminosity; many more megamasers have since been discovered.

A weak disk maser was discovered in 1995 emanating from the star MWC 349A, using NASA's [[Kuiper Airborne Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;Hydrogen Recombination Beta-Lines in MWC 349; C Thom, VS Strelnitski, J Martin-Pintado, HE Matthews, HA Smith; Astronomy and Astrophysics; v. 300, p.843&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence for an ''anti-pumped'' ([[dasar]]) sub-thermal population in the 4830&amp;nbsp;MHz transition of formaldehyde (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO) was observed in 1969 by Palmer ''et al.''

===Detection===
The connections of maser activity with far Infra-red (FIR) emission has been used to conduct searches of the sky with optical telescopes (because optical telescopes are easier to use for searches of this kind), and likely objects are then checked in the radio spectrum. Particularly targeted are molecular clouds, OH-IR stars, and FIR active galaxies.

===Known interstellar species===
The following species have been observed in stimulated emission from astronomical environments: &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lachowicz | first=Paweł | date=16 May 2007 | title=Astrophysical masers | url=https://users.camk.edu.pl/ptz/wyklad/maser.pdf | page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics of maser radiation==
The amplification or ''gain'' of radiation passing through a maser cloud is exponential. This has consequences for the radiation they produce:

===Beaming===
Small path differences across the irregularly shaped maser cloud become greatly distorted by exponential gain. Part of the cloud that has a slightly longer path length than the rest will appear much brighter (as it is the exponent of the path length that is relevant), and so maser spots are typically much smaller than their parent clouds. The majority of the radiation will emerge along this line of greatest path length in a "beam"; this is termed ''beaming''.

===Rapid variability===
As the gain of a maser depends exponentially on the population inversion and the [[velocity]]-coherent path length, any variation of either will itself result in exponential change of the maser output.

===Line narrowing===
Exponential gain also amplifies the centre of the line shape ([[Normal distribution|Gaussian]] or [[Cauchy distribution|Lorentzian]], etc.) more than the edges or wings. This results in an emission line shape that is much taller but not much wider. This makes the line appear narrower relative to the unamplified line.

===Saturation===
The exponential growth in intensity of radiation passing through a maser cloud continues as long as pumping processes can maintain the population inversion against the growing losses by stimulated emission. While this is so the maser is said to be ''unsaturated''. However, after a point, the population inversion cannot be maintained any longer and the maser becomes ''saturated''. In a saturated maser, amplification of radiation depends linearly on the size of population inversion and the path length. Saturation of one transition in a maser can affect the degree of inversion in other transitions in the same maser, an effect known as ''competitive gain''.

===High brightness===
The ''[[brightness temperature]]'' of a maser is the temperature a [[black body]] would have if producing the same emission brightness at the wavelength of the maser. That is, if an object had a temperature of about 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;[[Kelvin|K]] it would produce as much 1665-MHz radiation as a strong interstellar OH maser. Of course, at 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;K the OH molecule would [[dissociate]] ([[KT (energy)|kT]] is greater than the [[covalent bond|bond]] energy), so the brightness temperature is not directly indicative of the [[temperature|kinetic temperature]] of the maser gas but is nevertheless useful in describing maser emission. Masers have huge effective temperatures, many around 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;K, but some of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;K and even 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;K.

===Polarisation===
An important aspect of maser study is [[Polarization (waves)|polarisation]] of the emission. Astronomical masers are often very highly polarised, sometimes 100% (in the case of some OH masers) in a [[Circular polarization|circular fashion]], and to a lesser degree in a [[Linear polarization|linear fashion]]. This polarisation is due to some combination of the [[Zeeman effect]], magnetic beaming of the maser radiation, and [[anisotropic]] pumping which favours certain [[magnetic quantum number|magnetic-state]] transitions.

It should be noted that many of the characteristics of [[megamaser]] emission are different.

==Maser environments==

===Comets===
[[Comet]]s are small bodies (5–15&amp;nbsp;km diameter) of frozen volatiles (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) embedded in a crusty silicate filler. They orbit the sun in eccentric orbits and as they approach the sun the volatiles vaporise to form a halo, and later a tail, around the nucleus. Once vaporised these molecules can form inversions and mase.

The impact of comet [[Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9|Shoemaker-Levy 9]] with [[Jupiter]] in 1994 resulted in maser emissions in the 22&amp;nbsp;GHz region from the water molecule.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmovici, C. B.; Montebugnoli, S.; Pogrebenko, S.; Colom, P. [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=1995DPS....27.2802C&amp;amp;db_key=AST&amp;amp;data_type=HTML&amp;amp;format=&amp;amp;high=412cca40f919078 Water MASER Detection at 22 GHz after the SL-9/Jupiter Collision], [[Bulletin of the American Astronomical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the apparent rarity of these events, observation of the intense maser emission has been suggested as a detection scheme for [[extrasolar planets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/impact2000/pdf/3002.pdf Radio Search for Extrasolar Cometary Impacts at 22 Ghz (water Maser Emission)], Catastrophic Events Conference, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultraviolet light from the sun breaks down some H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules forming OH molecules that can mase. In 1997, 1667-MHz maser emission from the OH molecule was observed from comet [[Hale-Bopp]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogley R.N., Richards A.M.S., Spencer R.E. "[http://www.astro.keele.ac.uk/oldusers/rno/Research/ogley_IAJ_24_97.ps A Masing Hale-Bopp]", Irish Astr. J., 1997, 24, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planetary atmospheres===
It is predicted that masers exist in the atmospheres of gas giant planets, e.g. [http://www.atnf.csiro.au/news/newsletter/jun03/3and12mm_masers.htm]. Such masers would be highly variable due to planetary rotation (10-hour period for Jovian planets).

===Planetary systems===
In 2009, S. V. Pogrebenko et al.&lt;ref&gt;S. V. Pogrebenko et al., A&amp;A, 494, L1-L4 (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; reported [http://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2009/05/aa11186-08.pdf] the detection of water masers in the plumes of water associated with  the Saturnian  moons Hyperion, Titan, Enceladus, and Atlas.

===Stellar atmospheres===
[[File:Eso0725a.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|Pulsations of the [[Mira variable]] [[S Orionis]], showing dust production and [[maser]]s (ESO)]]
The conditions in the atmospheres of [[late-type star]]s support the pumping of different maser species at different distances from the star.  Due to instabilities within the nuclear burning sections of the star, the star experiences periods of increased energy release.  These pulses produce a shockwave that forces the atmosphere outward.  Hydroxyl masers occur at a distance of about 1000 to 10000 [[astronomical unit]]s (AU), water masers at a distance of about 100 to 400 AU, and silicon monoxide masers at a distance of about 5 to 10 AU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Vlemmings|author2=Diamond|author3=van Langevelde|author4=M Torrelles|title=The Magnetic Field in the Star-forming Region Cepheus a from Water Maser   Polarization Observations|doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20054275|date=2006|journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics|volume=448|issue=2|pages=597–611|arxiv=astro-ph/0510452|bibcode = 2006A&amp;A...448..597V }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both radiative and collisional pumping resulting from the shockwave have been suggested as the pumping mechanism for the silicon monoxide masers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Malcolm|year=2012|title=Maser Sources in Astrophysics|publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] |pages=218–230|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These masers diminish for larger radii as the gaseous silicon monoxide condenses into dust, depleting the available maser molecules.  For the water masers, the inner and outer radii limits roughly correspond to the density limits for maser operation.  At the inner boundary, the collisions between molecules are enough to remove a population inversion.  At the outer boundary, the density and optical depth is low enough that the gain of the maser is diminished.  Additionally, the hydroxyl masers are supported chemical pumping.  At the distances where these masers are found water molecules  are disassociated by UV radiation.

===Star-forming regions===
{{main|Star formation}}
[[Young stellar objects]] and (ultra)compact [[H II region]]s embedded in [[molecular cloud]]s and [[Dark nebula|giant molecular clouds]], support the bulk of astrophysical masers. Various pumping schemes - both radiative and collisional and combinations thereof - result in the maser emission of multiple transitions of many species. For example, the OH molecule has been observed to mase at 1612, 1665, 1667, 1720, 4660, 4750, 4765, 6031, 6035, and 13441&amp;nbsp;MHz. Water and [[methanol]] masers are also typical of these environments. Relatively rare masers such as [[ammonia]] and [[formaldehyde]] may also be found in star-forming regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Fish|author2=Reid|author3=Argon|author4=Xing-Wu Zheng|title=Full-Polarization Observations of OH Masers in Massive Star-Forming   Regions: I.

===Supernova remnants===
[[Image:IC 443.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer|WISE]] image of [[IC 443]], a [[supernova remnant]] with maser emission]]
The 1720&amp;nbsp;MHz maser transition of the OH molecule is known to be associated with [[supernova remnants]] that interact with [[molecular clouds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1068168 |title=Supernova Remnant OH Masers: Signposts of Cosmic Collision |date=2002 |last1=Wardle |first1=M. |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue=5577 |pages=2350–2354 |pmid=12089433 |last2=Yusef-Zadeh |first2=F|bibcode = 2002Sci...296.2350W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extragalactic sources===
While some of the masers in star forming regions can achieve luminosities sufficient for detection from external galaxies (such as the nearby [[Magellanic Clouds]]), masers observed from distant galaxies generally arise in wholly different conditions. Some galaxies possess central [[black hole]]s into which a disk of molecular material (about 0.5 [[parsec]] in size) is falling. Excitations of these molecules in the [[Active galaxy|disk]] or in a [[Relativistic jet|jet]] can result in ''[[megamaser]]s'' with large luminosities. Hydroxyl, water, and formaldehyde masers are known to exist in these conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1146/annurev.astro.41.011802.094927 |title=MEGA-MASERS AND GALAXIES |date=2005 |last1=Lo |first1=K.Y. |journal=Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics |volume=43 |pages=625–676|bibcode = 2005ARA&amp;A..43..625L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ongoing research==
Astronomical masers remain an active field of research in [[radio astronomy]] and laboratory astrophysics due, in part, to the fact that they are valuable diagnostic tools for astrophysical environments which may otherwise elude rigorous quantitative study and because they may facilitate the study of conditions which are inaccessible in terrestrial laboratories.

===Variability===
''Maser variability'' is generally understood to mean the change in apparent brightness to the observer. Intensity variations can occur on timescales from days to years indicating limits on maser size and excitation scheme. However, masers change in various ways over various timescales.

===Distance determinations===
Masers in star-forming regions are known to move across the sky along with the material that is flowing out from the forming star(s). Also, since the emission is a narrow spectral line, line-of-sight velocity can be determined from the [[Doppler shift]] variation of the observed frequency of the maser, permitting a three-dimensional mapping of the dynamics of the maser environment. Perhaps the most spectacular success of this technique is the dynamical determination of the distance to the galaxy [[NGC 4258]] from the analysis of the motion of the masers in the black-hole disk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Herrnstein|author2=Moran|author3=Greenhill|author4=Diamond|author5=Inoue|author6=Nakai|author7=Miyoshi|author8=Henkel|author9=Riess|title=A 4% Geometric Distance to the Galaxy NGC4258 from Orbital Motions in a   Nuclear Gas Disk|doi=10.1038/22972|date=1999|journal=Nature|volume=400|issue=6744|pages=539–541|arxiv=astro-ph/9907013|bibcode = 1999Natur.400..539H }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Also, water masers have been used to estimate the distance and [[proper motion]] of galaxies in the [[Local Group]], including that of the [[Triangulum Galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |arxiv=astro-ph/0503058|bibcode=2005Sci...307.1440B|doi=10.1126/science.1108342 |title=The Geometric Distance and Proper Motion of the Triangulum Galaxy (M33) |date=2005 |last1=Brunthaler |first1=A. |journal=Science |volume=307 |issue=5714 |pages=1440–1443 |pmid=15746420 |last2=Reid |first2=MJ |last3=Falcke |first3=H |last4=Greenhill |first4=LJ |last5=Henkel |first5=C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Very Long Baseline Interferometry|VLBI]] observations of maser sources in late type stars and star forming regions provide determinations of their [[trigonometric parallax]] and therefore their distance. This method is much more accurate than other distance determinations, and gives us information about the galactic distance scale (e.g. the distance of spiral arms).

===Open issues===
Unlike terrestrial lasers and masers for which the excitation mechanism is known and engineered, the reverse is true for astrophysical masers. In general, astrophysical masers are discovered empirically then studied further in order to develop plausible suggestions about possible pumping schemes. Quantification of the transverse size, spatial and temporal variations, and polarisation state (typically requiring VLBI telemetry) are all useful in the development of a pump theory. Galactic formaldehyde masing is one such example that remains problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Hoffman|author2=Goss|author3=Patrick Palmer|author4=Richards|title=The Formaldehyde Masers in NGC 7538 and G29.96-0.02: VLBA, MERLIN, and   VLA Observations|doi=10.1086/379062|date=2003|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=598|issue=2|pages=1061–1075|arxiv=astro-ph/0308256|bibcode = 2003ApJ...598.1061H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, some masers have been predicted to occur theoretically but have yet to be observed in nature.

Whilst there is a trend towards the miniaturization of devices, in particular, networks consisting of several miniaturized body sensor units (BSUs) together with a single body central unit (BCU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biomed Tech|year=2002|volume=47|pages=365–8|title=Body Area Network BAN—a key infrastructure element for patient-centered medical applications|vauthors=Schmidt R, Norgall T, Mörsdorf J, Bernhard J, von der Grün T |pmid=12451866|issue=1|doi=10.1515/bmte.2002.47.s1a.365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger decimeter (tab and pad) sized [[smart devices]], accompanied devices, still play an important role in terms of acting as a data hub, data gateway and providing a user interface to view and manage BAN applications, in-situ. The development of WBAN technology started around 1995 around the idea of using  [[wireless personal area network]] (WPAN) technologies to implement communications on, near, and around the human body. About six years later, the term "BAN" came to refer to systems where communication is entirely within, on, and in the immediate proximity of a human body.&lt;ref name=Yuce&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|year=2010|volume=162|issue=1|title=Implementation of wireless body area networks for healthcare systems|author=M.

==Concept==
The rapid growth in physiological sensors, low-power integrated circuits, and wireless communication has enabled a new generation of [[wireless sensor networks]], now used for purposes such as monitoring traffic, crops, infrastructure, and health. The body area network field is an interdisciplinary area which could allow inexpensive and continuous health monitoring with real-time updates of medical records through the Internet. A number of intelligent physiological sensors can be integrated into a wearable wireless body area network, which can be used for computer-assisted rehabilitation or early detection of medical conditions. This area relies on the feasibility of implanting very small biosensors inside the human body that are comfortable and that don't impair normal activities. The implanted sensors in the human body will collect various physiological changes in order to monitor the patient's health status no matter their location. The information will be transmitted wirelessly to an external processing unit. This device will instantly transmit all information in real time to the doctors throughout the world. If an emergency is detected, the physicians will immediately inform the patient through the computer system by sending appropriate messages or alarms. Currently the level of information provided and energy resources capable of powering the sensors are limiting. While the technology is still in its primitive stage it is being widely researched and once adopted, is expected to be a breakthrough invention in [[healthcare]], leading to concepts like [[telemedicine]] and [[mHealth]] becoming real.

==Applications==
Initial applications of BANs are expected to appear primarily in the healthcare domain, especially for continuous monitoring and logging vital parameters of patients suffering from [[chronic disease]]s such as [[diabetes]], [[asthma]] and [[heart attacks]].

* A BAN network in place on a patient can alert the hospital, even before they have a heart attack, through measuring changes in their [[vital signs]].
* A BAN network on a diabetic patient could auto inject insulin through a pump, as soon as their insulin level declines.

Other applications of this technology include sports, military, or security. Extending the technology to new areas could also assist communication by seamless exchanges of information between individuals, or between individual and machines.

==Standards==
The latest international standard for BANs is the [[IEEE 802.15.6]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.6-2012.html IEEE P802.15.6-2012 Standard for Wireless Body Area Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
A typical BAN or BSN requires vital sign monitoring [[sensors]], motion detectors (through [[accelerometers]]) to help identify the location of the monitored individual and some form of communication, to transmit vital sign and motion readings to medical practitioners or care givers. A typical body area network kit will consist of sensors, a [[microprocessor|Processor]], a [[transceiver]] and a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Physiological sensors, such as [[ECG]] and [[SpO2]] sensors, have been developed. Other sensors such as a blood pressure sensor, [[EEG]] sensor and a [[PDA]] for BSN interface are under development.&lt;ref&gt;http://vip.doc.ic.ac.uk/bsn/m621.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless communication in the U.S.===
The FCC has approved the allocation of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum bandwidth for medical BAN low-power, wide-area radio links at the 2360–2400&amp;nbsp;MHz band. This will allow off-loading MBAN communication from the already saturated standard Wi-Fi spectrum to a standard band.&lt;ref name="urlBody Area Networks should free hospital bandwidth, untether patients - Computerworld"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9227683/_Body_Area_Networks_should_free_hospital_bandwidth_untether_patients?source=CTWNLE_nlt_emgtech_2012-06-06

|website=
|accessdate=2012-06-06
|date=2012-06-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2360–2390&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range is available on a secondary basis. The FCC will expand the existing Medical Device Radiocommunication (MedRadio) Service in Part 95 of its rules. MBAN devices using the band will operate under a ‘license-by-rule’ basis which eliminates the need to apply for individual transmitter licenses. Usage of the 2360–2390&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies are restricted to indoor operation at health-care facilities and are subject to registration and site approval by coordinators to protect aeronautical telemetry primary usage. Operation in the 2390–2400&amp;nbsp;MHz band is not subject to registration or coordination and may be used in all areas including residential.&lt;ref name="urlFCC Dedicates Spectrum Enabling Medical Body Area Networks | FCC.gov"&gt;{{cite web

==Challenges==
Problems with the use of this technology could include:

* '''Data Quality''': Data generated and collected through BANs can play a key role in the patient care process. It is essential that the quality of this data is of a high standard to ensure that the decisions made are based on the best information possible
* '''Data Management''': As BANs generate large volumes of data, the need to manage and maintain these datasets is of utmost importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439821817;jsessionid=QYm6NTA3ICOGNBvOn3i9MA** Lai, D. , Begg, R.K. and Palaniswami, M. eds, Healthcare Sensor Networks: Challenges towards practical implementation], {{ISBN|978-1-4398-2181-7}}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sensor Validation''': Pervasive sensing devices are subject to inherent communication and hardware constraints including unreliable wired/wireless network links, interference and limited power reserves. This may result in erroneous datasets being transmitted back to the end user. It is of the utmost importance especially within a healthcare domain that all sensor readings are validated. This helps to reduce false alarm generation and to identify possible weaknesses within the hardware and software design.
* '''Data Consistency''': Data residing on multiple mobile devices and wireless patient notes need to be collected and analysed in a seamless fashion. Within body area networks, vital patient datasets may be fragmented over a number of nodes and across a number of networked PCs or Laptops. If a medical practitioner′s mobile device does not contain all known information then the quality of patient care may degrade.
* '''Security''': Considerable effort would be required to make WBAN transmission secure and accurate. It would have to be made sure that the patient ‘'secure‘’ data is only derived from each patient's dedicated WBAN system and is not mixed up with other patient's data. Further, the data generated from WBAN should have secure and limited access. Although security is a high priority in most networks, little study has been done in this area for WBANs. As WBANs are resource-constrained in terms of power, memory, communication rate and computational capability, security solutions proposed for other networks may not be applicable to WBANs. Confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and freshness of data together with availability and secure management are the security requirements in WBAN. The IEEE 802.15.6 standard, which is latest standard for WBAN, tried to provide security in WBAN. However, it has several security problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book&lt;!-- Deny Citation Bot--&gt; |arxiv = 1501.02601|last1 = Toorani|first1 = Mohsen|chapter= On Vulnerabilities of the Security Association in the IEEE 802.15.6 Standard|title= Financial Cryptography and Data Security |volume = 8976 |pages = 245–260|year = 2015|doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-48051-9_18|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-662-48050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interoperability''': WBAN systems would have to ensure seamless [[data transfer]] across standards such as [[Bluetooth]], [[ZigBee]] etc. to promote information exchange, [[plug and play]] device interaction. Further, the systems would have to be [[scalable]], ensure efficient migration across networks and offer uninterrupted connectivity.
* '''System devices''': The sensors used in WBAN would have to be low on complexity, small in form factor, light in weight, power efficient, easy to use and reconfigurable. Further, the storage devices need to facilitate remote storage and viewing of patient data as well as access to external processing and analysis tools via the [[Internet]].
* '''Invasion of privacy''': People might consider the WBAN technology as a potential threat to freedom, if the applications go beyond "secure" medical usage. Social acceptance would be key to this technology finding a wider application.
* '''Interference''': The wireless link used for body sensors should reduce the interference and increase the coexistence of sensor node devices with other network devices available in the environment. This is especially important for large scale implementation of WBAN systems.&lt;ref name=Yuce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garcia P., "A Methodology for the Deployment of Sensor Networks", IEEE Transactions On Knowledge And Data Engineering, vol. 11, no. 4, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Cost''': Today's consumers expect low cost health monitoring solutions which provide high functionality. WBAN implementations will need to be cost optimized to be appealing alternatives to health conscious consumers.
*'''Constant monitoring''': Users may require different levels of monitoring, for example those at risk of cardiac ischemia may want their WBANs to function constantly, while others at risk of falls may only need WBANs to monitor them while they are walking or moving. The level of monitoring influences the amount of energy required and the life cycle of the BAN before the energy source is depleted.
*'''Constrained deployment''': The WBAN needs to be wearable, lightweight and non intrusive. It should not alter or encumber the user's daily activities. The technology should ultimately be transparent to the user i.e., it should perform its monitoring tasks without the user realising it.
*'''Consistent performance''': The performance of the WBAN should be consistent. Sensor measurements should be accurate and calibrated, even when the WBAN is switched off and switched on again.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucc.ie/en/media/research/misl/2009publications/pervasive09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The wireless links should be robust and work under various user environments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5545">{{lowercase|title=cDNA Library}}
{{Unreferenced|date=May 2008}}
A '''cDNA library''' is a combination of cloned cDNA ([[complementary DNA]]) fragments inserted into a collection of host cells, which together constitute some portion of the [[transcriptome]] of the organism and are stored as a "[[DNA library|library]]". cDNA is produced from fully transcribed [[mRNA]] found in the [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] and therefore contains only the expressed genes of an organism. Similarly, tissue-specific cDNA libraries can be produced. In [[eukaryotic]] cells the mature mRNA is already [[RNA splicing|spliced]], hence the cDNA produced lacks [[introns]] and can be readily expressed in a bacterial cell. While information in cDNA libraries is a powerful and useful tool since gene products are easily identified, the libraries lack information about [[enhancers]], [[introns]], and other regulatory elements found in a [[genomic library|genomic DNA library]].

== cDNA Library Construction ==
[[File:Formation of a cDNA Library.jpg|thumb|300 px|Formation of a cDNA library.]]

cDNA is created from a mature [[mRNA]] from a eukaryotic cell with the use of [[reverse transcriptase]]. In eukaryotes, a [[mRNA#Polyadenylation|poly-(A) tail]] (consisting of a long sequence of adenine nucleotides) distinguishes [[mRNA]] from [[tRNA]] and [[rRNA]] and can therefore be used as a [[Primer (molecular biology)|primer]] site for reverse transcription. This has the problem that not all transcripts, such as those for the [[histone]], encode a [[poly-A tail]].

=== mRNA extraction ===
Firstly, the mRNA is obtained and purified from the rest of the RNAs. Several methods exist for purifying RNA such as [[trizol]] extraction and [[column purification]]. Column purification is done by using oligomeric dT nucleotide coated resins where only the mRNA having the poly-A tail will bind. The rest of the RNAs are eluted out. The mRNA is eluted by using eluting buffer and some heat to separate the mRNA strands from oligo-dT.

=== cDNA construction ===
Once mRNA is purified, ''oligo-dT'' (a short sequence of deoxy-thymidine nucleotides) is tagged as a complementary primer which binds to the poly-A tail providing a free 3'-OH end that can be extended by reverse transcriptase to create the complementary DNA strand. Now, the mRNA is removed by using a [[RNAse]] enzyme leaving a single stranded cDNA (sscDNA). This sscDNA is converted into a double stranded DNA with the help of [[DNA polymerase]]. However, for DNA polymerase to synthesize a complementary strand a free 3'-OH end is needed. This is provided by the sscDNA itself by generating a ''[[hairpin loop]]'' at the 3' end by coiling on itself. The polymerase extends the 3'-OH end and later the loop at 3' end is opened by the scissoring action of [[S1 nuclease|''S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; nuclease'']]. [[Restriction endonucleases]] and [[DNA ligase]] are then used to [[cloning|clone]] the sequences into bacterial [[plasmid]]s.

The cloned bacteria are then selected, commonly through the use of antibiotic selection. Once selected, stocks of the bacteria are created which can later be grown and sequenced to compile the cDNA library.

== cDNA Library uses ==
cDNA libraries are commonly used when reproducing eukaryotic genomes, as the amount of information is reduced to remove the large numbers of non-coding regions from the library. cDNA libraries are used to express eukaryotic genes in prokaryotes. Prokaryotes do not have introns in their DNA and therefore do not possess any enzymes that can cut it out during transcription process. cDNA does not have introns and therefore can be expressed in prokaryotic cells. cDNA libraries are most useful in [[reverse genetics]] where the additional genomic information is of less use. Additionally, cDNA libraries are frequently used in [[functional cloning]] to identify genes based on the encoded protein's function. 

=== cDNA Library vs. Genomic DNA Library ===
cDNA library lacks the non-coding and regulatory elements found in genomic DNA. [[Genomic DNA library|Genomic DNA libraries]] provide  more detailed information about the organism, but are more resource-intensive to generate and maintain.

== Cloning of cDNA ==
cDNA molecules can be cloned by using restriction site linkers. Linkers are short, double stranded pieces of DNA ('''oligodeoxyribonucleotide''') about 8 to 12 nucleotide pairs long that include a [[restriction endonuclease]] cleavage site e.g. BamHI.
Both the cDNA and the linker have blunt ends which can be ligated together using a high concentration of T4 DNA ligase. Then sticky ends are produced in the cDNA molecule by cleaving the cDNA ends (which now have linkers with an incorporated site) with the appropriate endonuclease. A [[cloning vector]] ([[plasmid]]) is then also cleaved with the appropriate endonuclease. Following "[[sticky end]]" ligation of the insert into the vector the resulting recombinant DNA molecule is transferred into ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'' host cell for cloning.

'''Card sorting''' is a technique in [[user experience design]] in which a person tests a group of subject experts or users to generate a [[dendrogram]] (category tree) or [[folksonomy]]. It is a useful approach for designing [[information architecture]], workflows, menu structure, or web site navigation paths.

Card sorting uses a relatively low-tech approach. The person conducting the test (usability analyst, user experience designer, etc.) first identifies key concepts and writes them on  [[index card]]s or [[Post-it note]]s. Test subjects, individually or sometimes as a group, then arrange the cards to represent how they see the structure and relationships of the information.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 1995" &gt;{{cite web

Groups can be organized as collaborative groups ([[focus groups]]) or as repeated individual sorts. The literature discusses appropriate numbers of users needed to produce trustworthy results.&lt;ref name="Nielsen 2004" &gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that context, the items to organize are those significant in the environment. The way the items are organized should make sense to the target audience and cannot be determined from [[first principles]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The field of [[information architecture]] is founded on the study of the structure of information. If an accepted and standardized [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] exists for a subject, it would be natural to apply that taxonomy to organize both the information in the environment, and any navigation to particular subjects or functions.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} Card sorting is useful when:
* The variety of items to organize is so great that no existing taxonomy is accepted as organizing the items.
* Similarities among the items make them difficult to divide clearly into categories.
* Members of the audience that uses the environment differ significantly in how they view the similarities among items and the appropriate groupings of items.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

==Basic method==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
To perform a card sort:
# A person representative of the audience receives a set of index cards with terms written on them.
# This person groups the terms in whatever way they think is logical, and gives each group a category name, either from an existing card or by writing a name on a blank card.
# Testers repeat this process across a group of test subjects.
# The testers later analyze the results to discover patterns.

==Variants==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}
===Open card sorting===
In an '''open card sort''', participants create their own names for the categories. This helps reveal not only how they mentally classify the cards, but also what terms they use for the categories. Open sorting is '''generative'''; it is typically used to discover patterns in how participants classify, which in turn helps generate ideas for organizing information.

===Closed card sorting===
In a '''closed card sort''', participants are provided with a predetermined set of category names. They then assign the index cards to these fixed categories. This helps reveal the degree to which the participants agree on which cards belong under each category. Closed sorting is '''evaluative'''; it is typically used to judge whether a given set of category names provides an effective way to organize a given collection of content.

===Reverse card sorting===
In a '''reverse card sort''' (more popularly called [[tree testing]]), an existing structure of categories and sub-categories is tested. Users are given tasks and are asked to complete them navigating a collection of cards. Each card contains the names of subcategories related to a category, and the user should find the card most relevant to the given task starting from the main card with the top-level categories. This ensures that the structure is evaluated in isolation, nullifying the effects of navigational aids, visual design, and other factors. Reverse card sorting is '''evaluative'''—it judges whether a predetermined hierarchy provides a good way to find information.

==Analysis==
Various methods can be used to analyze the data. The purpose of the analysis is to extract patterns from the population of test subjects, so that a common set of categories and relationships emerges. This common set is then incorporated into the design of the environment, either for navigation or for other purposes. Card sorting is also evaluated through [[dendrogram]]s. There is some indication that different evaluation methods for card sorting provide different results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

==Online (remote) card sorting==
A number of web-based tools are available to perform card sorting. The perceived advantage of web-based card sorting is that it reaches a larger group of participants at a lower cost. The software can also help analyze the sort results. A perceived disadvantage of a remote card sort is the lack of personal interaction between card sort participants and the card sort administrator, which may produce valuable insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tullis|first1=Tom|title=Card-sorting Tools|url=http://measuringuserexperience.com/cardsorting/index.htm|website=Measuring User Experience|page=1|accessdate=29 August 2017|date=3 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''casebook method''', similar to but not exactly the same as the [[case method]], is the primary method of teaching [[law]] in [[Law school in the United States|law schools in the United States]].  It was pioneered at [[Harvard Law School]] by [[Christopher C. Langdell]].  It is based on the principle that rather than studying highly abstract summaries of legal rules (the technique used in most countries), the best way to learn [[Law of the United States|American law]] is to read the actual judicial [[opinion]]s which become the law under the rule of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (due to its Anglo-American [[common law]] origin).

==History and technique==
To set up the case method of law study, American law [[professor]]s traditionally collect the most illustrative cases concerning a particular area of the law in special textbooks called [[casebook]]s.  Some professors heavily edit cases down to the most important paragraphs, while deleting nearly all citations and paraphrasing everything else; a few present all cases in full, and most others are in between.  One common technique is to provide almost all of the entire text of a landmark case which created an important legal rule, followed by brief notes summarizing the holdings of other cases which further refined the rule.  
  
Traditionally, the casebook method is coupled with the [[Socratic method]] in American law schools.  For a given class, a professor will assign several cases from the casebook to read, and may also require students to be familiar with any notes following those cases.  In class, the professor will ask students questions about the assigned cases to determine whether they identified and understood the correct rule from the case, if there is one—in certain heavily contested areas of the law, there will ''not'' be any ''one'' correct rule.

A typical example in the law of contracts is ''[[Hadley v Baxendale]]'' (1854), a case that is still routinely tested on bar examinations today.  Treatises designed for practicing lawyers as well as textbooks for students earning non-legal degrees (i.e., business law courses for business administration students) concisely state the famous rules announced in that case that (1) consequential damages are limited to those foreseen by the parties at the time of contracting, thus implying that (2) a party must notify the other up front of its specific needs in order to expand what is mutually foreseeable and thereby recover consequential damages if the other breaches.  Thus stated, ''Hadley'' seems simple enough, but a casebook for a law school course will ''never'' say that.  Rather, the law student must deduce those principles from the somewhat archaic text of the Court of Exchequer's mid-19th-century decision.

This teaching method differs in two ways from the teaching methods used in most other academic programs: (1) it requires students to work almost exclusively with primary source material, which can be written in obscure or obsolete language for older cases; and (2) a typical American law school class is supposed to be a dialogue about the meaning of a case, not a straightforward lecture.

In some law schools, the casebook method is used in conjunction with lectures or other more structured forms of instruction.  This is especially true in classes which are more heavily geared toward [[statutory law]], such as [[tax law]] (which in the USA is governed by the [[Internal Revenue Code]]) and certain areas of [[commercial law]] (particularly courses dealing with the [[Uniform Commercial Code]]).

This method is also used in other [[common law]] countries, including [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

===Law school outlines===
To facilitate the case method of study, "law school outlines" are used as legal topic [[study aid]]s. Typically, the outlines are created by [[law school]] students; however, there are professional outlines also available.  An outline typically provides a concise and direct statement of legal issues in a particular area of [[law]], organized according to the typical law school [[curriculum]]. In some cases, outlines are organized according to specific professors or courses. Outlines often remove many legal nuances and fact specific distinctions in [[case law]] to establish more generalized legal principles.  Students must remember to be cautious before relying on outlines written by others found on online databases.  They frequently come with copyright notices and may often be outdated.  Many such sites also warn their users that relying on these outlines alone will not be sufficient to prepare for an exam and they should only be used as a supplement to the studying process.

[[File:Quakingfallcolors.JPG|thumb|upright=1.35|Many organisms, including [[aspen tree]]s, reproduce by cloning]]
'''Cloning''' is the process of producing [[genetics|genetically]] identical individuals of an [[organism]] either naturally or artificially. In nature, many organisms produce clones through [[asexual reproduction]]. Cloning in [[biotechnology]] refers to the process of creating clones of organisms or copies of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s or [[DNA]] fragments ([[molecular cloning]]). Beyond [[biology]], the term refers to the production of multiple copies of [[digital media]] or [[software]].

The term '''clone''', invented by [[J. B. S. Haldane]], is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] word [[wikt:κλών#Ancient Greek|κλών]] ''klōn'', "twig", referring to the process whereby a new plant can be created from a twig. In botany, the term '''lusus''' was traditionally used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=de Candolle, A.|year=1868|title=Laws of Botanical Nomenclature adopted by the International Botanical Congress held at Paris in August 1867; together with an Historical Introduction and Commentary by Alphonse de Candolle, Translated from the French|publisher=L.

Weddell}}{{rp|21, 43}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[horticulture]], the spelling ''clon'' was used until the twentieth century; the final ''e'' came into use to indicate the vowel is a "long o" instead of a "short o".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Natural cloning==
Cloning is a natural form of reproduction that has allowed life forms to spread for hundreds of millions of years.

==Molecular cloning==
{{Main|Molecular cloning}}
Molecular cloning refers to the process of making multiple molecules. Cloning is commonly used to amplify [[DNA]] fragments containing whole [[genes]], but it can also be used to amplify any DNA sequence such as [[Promoter (biology)|promoters]], non-coding sequences and randomly fragmented DNA. It is used in a wide array of biological experiments and practical applications ranging from [[genetic fingerprinting]] to large scale protein production. Occasionally, the term cloning is misleadingly used to refer to the identification of the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] location of a gene associated with a particular phenotype of interest, such as in [[positional cloning]]. In practice, localization of the gene to a chromosome or genomic region does not necessarily enable one to isolate or amplify the relevant genomic sequence. To amplify any DNA sequence in a living organism, that sequence must be linked to an [[origin of replication]], which is a sequence of DNA capable of directing the propagation of itself and any linked sequence. However, a number of other features are needed, and a variety of specialised [[cloning vector]]s (small piece of DNA into which a foreign DNA fragment can be inserted) exist that allow [[protein production]], [[affinity tag]]ging, single stranded [[RNA]] or DNA production and a host of other molecular biology tools.

Cloning of any DNA fragment essentially involves four steps&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=iGenetics: A Molecular Approach |author= Peter J. Russel |year= 2005 |isbn=978-0-8053-4665-7 |location=San Francisco, California, United States of America |publisher=Pearson Education}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# fragmentation - breaking apart a strand of DNA
# [[DNA ligase|ligation]] - gluing together pieces of DNA in a desired sequence
# [[transfection]] – inserting the newly formed pieces of DNA into cells
# screening/selection – selecting out the cells that were successfully transfected with the new DNA

Although these steps are invariable among cloning procedures a number of alternative routes can be selected;  these are summarized as a ''cloning strategy''.

Initially, the DNA of interest needs to be isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using [[restriction enzyme]]s, and incubated with the fragment of interest under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called [[DNA ligase]]. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is transfected into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, [[electroporation]], [[optical injection]] and [[biolistics]]. Finally, the transfected cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, there is a need to identify the cells that have been successfully transfected with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable [[antibiotic]] resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been transfected, to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on [[X-gal]] medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of [[PCR]], restriction fragment analysis and/or [[DNA sequencing]].

== Cell cloning ==

===Cloning unicellular organisms===
[[File:Human cell-line colony being cloned in vitro through use of cloning rings.jpg|right|thumb|Cloning cell-line colonies using cloning rings]]
Cloning a cell means to derive a population of cells from a single cell. In the case of unicellular organisms such as bacteria and yeast, this process is remarkably simple and essentially only requires the [[inoculation]] of the appropriate medium. However, in the case of cell cultures from multi-cellular organisms, cell cloning is an arduous task as these cells will not readily grow in standard media.

A useful tissue culture technique used to clone distinct lineages of cell lines involves the use of cloning rings (cylinders).&lt;ref name="CloningRings"&gt;{{cite journal|last=McFarland|first=Douglas|authorlink=Douglas McFarland|year=2000|title= Preparation of pure cell cultures by cloning|journal=Methods in Cell Science|volume=22|issue=1|pages=63–66|pmid=10650336|doi= 10.1023/A:1009838416621}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this technique a single-cell suspension of cells that have been exposed to a [[mutagen|mutagenic agent]] or drug used to drive [[Selection (biology)|selection]] is plated at high dilution to create isolated colonies, each arising from a single and potentially clonal distinct cell. At an early growth stage when colonies consist of only a few cells, sterile [[polystyrene]] rings (cloning rings), which have been dipped in grease, are placed over an individual colony and a small amount of [[trypsin]] is added. Cloned cells are collected from inside the ring and transferred to a new vessel for further growth.

=== Cloning stem cells ===
{{Main|Somatic-cell nuclear transfer}}
[[Somatic-cell nuclear transfer]], known as SCNT, can also be used to create embryos for research or therapeutic purposes. The most likely purpose for this is to produce embryos for use in [[stem cell research]]. This process is also called "research cloning" or "therapeutic cloning." The goal is not to create cloned human beings (called "reproductive cloning"), but rather to harvest stem cells that can be used to study human development and to potentially treat disease. While a clonal human blastocyst has been created, stem cell lines are yet to be isolated from a clonal source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/health/blog/2008/01/california_biot.html|title=California biotech says it cloned a human embryo, but no stem cells produced|first=Gideon|last=Gil|publisher=Boston Globe|date=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapeutic cloning is achieved by creating embryonic stem cells in the hopes of treating diseases such as diabetes and Alzheimer's. The process begins by removing the nucleus (containing the DNA) from an egg cell and inserting a nucleus from the adult cell to be cloned.&lt;ref name="Halim"&gt;{{cite web |last=Halim |first=N. |date=September 2002 |title=Extensive new study shows abnormalities in cloned animals |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |publisher=Massachusetts institute of technology |url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/2002/cloning-0911.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of someone with Alzheimer's disease, the nucleus from a skin cell of that patient is placed into an empty egg. The reprogrammed cell begins to develop into an embryo because the egg reacts with the transferred nucleus. The embryo will become genetically identical to the patient.&lt;ref name=Halim /&gt; The embryo will then form a blastocyst which has the potential to form/become any cell in the body.&lt;ref name="Plus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Plus |first=M. |year=2011 |title= Fetal development |accessdate=October 31, 2011 |url= https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/002398.htm |publisher=Nlm.nih.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reason why SCNT is used for cloning is because somatic cells can be easily acquired and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point to remember is that cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor's somatic cell nucleus.&lt;ref name="Latham"&gt;{{cite web |last=Latham |first=K. E. |year=2005 |title=Early and delayed aspects of nuclear reprogramming during cloning |publisher=Biology of the Cell |pages=97, 119–132 |url=http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140802122210/http://submit.biolcell.org/boc/097/0119/0970119.pdf |archivedate=2 August 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, the same way it would on sperm cells.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

The process of cloning a particular farm animal using SCNT is relatively the same for all animals. The first step is to collect the somatic cells from the animal that will be cloned. The somatic cells could be used immediately or stored in the laboratory for later use.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; The hardest part of SCNT is removing maternal DNA from an oocyte at metaphase II. Once this has been done, the somatic nucleus can be inserted into an egg cytoplasm.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This creates a one-cell embryo. The grouped somatic cell and egg cytoplasm are then introduced to an electrical current.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; This energy will hopefully allow the cloned embryo to begin development. The successfully developed embryos are then placed in surrogate recipients, such as a cow or sheep in the case of farm animals.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt;

SCNT is seen as a good method for producing agriculture animals for food consumption. It successfully cloned sheep, cattle, goats, and pigs. Another benefit is SCNT is seen as a solution to clone endangered species that are on the verge of going extinct.&lt;ref name=Latham /&gt; However, stresses placed on both the egg cell and the introduced nucleus can be enormous, which led to a high loss in resulting cells in early research. For example, [[Dolly (sheep)|the cloned sheep Dolly]] was born after 277 eggs were used for SCNT, which created 29 viable embryos. Only three of these embryos survived until birth, and only one survived to adulthood.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Campbell KH, McWhir J, Ritchie WA, Wilmut I |title=Sheep cloned by nuclear transfer from a cultured cell line |journal=Nature |volume=380 |issue=6569 |pages=64–6 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8598906 |doi=10.1038/380064a0 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the procedure could not be automated, and had to be performed manually under a [[microscope]], SCNT was very resource intensive. The biochemistry involved in reprogramming the [[cellular differentiation|differentiated]] somatic cell nucleus and activating the recipient egg was also far from being well understood. However, by 2014 researchers were reporting cloning success rates of seven to eight out of ten&lt;ref&gt;Shukman, David (14 January 2014) [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-25576718 China cloning on an 'industrial scale'] BBC News Science and Environment, Retrieved 10 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2016, a Korean Company Sooam Biotech was reported to be producing 500 cloned embryos per day.&lt;ref name="NewScientist500"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Zastrow|first1=Mark|title=Inside the cloning factory that creates 500 new animals a day|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2076681-inside-the-cloning-factory-that-creates-500-new-animals-a-day/|accessdate=23 February 2016|publisher=New Scientist|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In SCNT, not all of the donor cell's genetic information is transferred, as the donor cell's [[mitochondria]] that contain their own [[mitochondrial DNA]] are left behind. The resulting hybrid cells retain those mitochondrial structures which originally belonged to the egg. As a consequence, clones such as Dolly that are born from SCNT are not perfect copies of the donor of the nucleus.

== Organism cloning ==
{{See also|Asexual reproduction|Cuttings (plants)|vegetative reproduction}}
'''Organism cloning''' (also called reproductive cloning) refers to the procedure of creating a new multicellular organism, genetically identical to another. In essence this form of cloning is an asexual method of reproduction, where fertilization or inter-gamete contact does not take place. Asexual reproduction is a naturally occurring phenomenon in many species, including most plants and some insects. Scientists have made some major achievements with cloning, including the asexual reproduction of sheep and cows. There is a lot of ethical debate over whether or not cloning should be used. However, cloning, or asexual propagation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/plantanswers/misc/asexualpropagation.html |title=Asexual Propagation |publisher=Aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been common practice in the horticultural world for hundreds of years.

=== Horticultural ===
[[File:Vine shoots.JPG|thumb|Propagating plants from [[cuttings (plants)|cuttings]], such as grape vines, is an ancient form of cloning]]
{{For|the use of cloning in viticulture|Propagation of grapevines}}
The term ''clone'' is used in horticulture to refer to descendants of a single plant which were produced by [[vegetative reproduction]] or [[apomixis]]. Many horticultural plant [[cultivar]]s are clones, having been derived from a single individual, multiplied by some process other than sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Sagers, Larry A. (2 March 2009) [http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf Proliferate favorite trees by grafting, cloning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301102536/http://www.usu.edu/ust/pdf/2009/march/itn03030976.pdf |date=1 March 2014 }} Utah Stae University, Deseret News (Salt Lake City) Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, some European cultivars of [[grape]]s represent clones that have been propagated for over two millennia. Other examples are [[potato]] and [[banana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1073/pnas.1102001108| title = Multidisciplinary perspectives on banana (''Musa'' spp.) domestication| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| volume = 108| url = http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130704133315/http://www.agr.kuleuven.ac.be/nieuws/fiches/PNAS-110720.pdf| dead-url = yes| archive-date = 2013-07-04| issue = 28| pages = 11311–11318| year = 2011| last1 = Perrier| first1 = X.| last2 = De Langhe| first2 = E.| last3 = Donohue| first3 = M.| last4 = Lentfer| first4 = C.| last5 = Vrydaghs| first5 = L.| last6 = Bakry| first6 = F.| last7 = Carreel| first7 = F.| last8 = Hippolyte| first8 = I.| last9 = Horry| first9 = J. -P.| last10 = Jenny| first10 = C.| last11 = Lebot| first11 = V.| last12 = Risterucci| first12 = A. -M.| last13 = Tomekpe| first13 = K.| last14 = Doutrelepont| first14 = H.| last15 = Ball| first15 = T.| last16 = Manwaring| first16 = J.| last17 = De Maret| first17 = P.| last18 = Denham| first18 = T.| pmid = 21730145| pmc = 3136277}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grafting]] can be regarded as cloning, since all the shoots and branches coming from the graft are genetically a clone of a single individual, but this particular kind of cloning has not come under [[ethics|ethical]] scrutiny and is generally treated as an entirely different kind of operation.

Many [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s, [[vine]]s, [[fern]]s and other [[perennials|herbaceous perennial]]s form [[clonal colony|clonal colonies]] naturally. Parts of an individual plant may become detached by [[Fragmentation (cell biology)|fragmentation]] and grow on to become separate clonal individuals. A common example is in the vegetative reproduction of moss and liverwort gametophyte clones by means of [[gemma (botany)|gemmae]]. Some vascular plants e.g. [[dandelion]] and certain [[viviparity|viviparous]] grasses also form [[seed]]s asexually, termed [[apomixis]], resulting in clonal populations of genetically identical individuals.

=== Parthenogenesis ===
Clonal derivation exists in nature in some animal species and is referred to as [[parthenogenesis]] (reproduction of an organism by itself without a mate). This is an asexual form of reproduction that is only found in females of some insects, crustaceans, nematodes,&lt;ref&gt;Castagnone-Sereno P, et al. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23682915 Diversity and evolution of root-knot nematodes, genus Meloidogyne: new insights from the genomic era] Annu Rev Phytopathol. 2013;51:203-20&lt;/ref&gt; fish (for example the [[hammerhead shark]]&lt;ref name =NYTShubin&gt;Shubin, Neil (24 February 2008) [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/24/opinion/24shubin.html Birds Do It. Bees Do It. Dragons Don’t Need To] New York Times, Retrieved 21 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;), the [[Komodo dragon]]&lt;ref name =NYTShubin/&gt; and [[whiptail lizard|lizards]]. The growth and development occurs without fertilization by a male. In plants, parthenogenesis means the development of an embryo from an unfertilized egg cell, and is a component process of apomixis. In species that use the [[XY sex-determination system]], the offspring will always be female. An example is the little fire ant (''[[Wasmannia auropunctata]]''), which is native to [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]] but has spread throughout many tropical environments.

=== Artificial cloning of organisms ===
Artificial cloning of organisms may also be called ''reproductive cloning''.

==== First steps ====
[[Hans Spemann]], a [[Germans|German]] [[embryologist]] was awarded a [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine]] in 1935 for his discovery of the effect now known as embryonic induction, exercised by various parts of the embryo, that directs the development of groups of cells into particular tissues and organs. In 1928 he and his student, [[Hilde Mangold]], were the first to perform [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] using [[amphibian]] embryos – one of the first steps towards cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=De Robertis|first1=EM|title=Spemann's organizer and self-regulation in amphibian embryos|journal=Nature Reviews. Molecular Cell Biology|date=April 2006|volume=7|issue=4|pages=296–302|pmid=16482093|pmc=2464568|doi=10.1038/nrm1855}}.  See [http://www.nature.com/nrm/journal/v7/n4/box/nrm1855_BX1.html Box 1: Explanation of the Spemann-Mangold experiment]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Methods ====
Reproductive cloning generally uses "[[somatic cell nuclear transfer]]" (SCNT) to create animals that are genetically identical. This process entails the transfer of a nucleus from a donor adult cell (somatic cell) to an egg from which the nucleus has been removed, or to a cell from a [[blastocyst]] from which the nucleus has been removed.&lt;ref name=HumanGenomeInfo&gt;{{cite web|title=Cloning Fact Sheet|url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|publisher=Human Genome Project Information|accessdate=25 October 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml|archivedate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the egg begins to divide normally it is transferred into the uterus of the surrogate mother. Such clones are not strictly identical since the somatic cells may contain mutations in their nuclear DNA. Additionally, the [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] in the [[cytoplasm]] also contains DNA and during SCNT this mitochondrial DNA is wholly from the cytoplasmic donor's egg, thus the [[mitochondrion|mitochondrial]] genome is not the same as that of the nucleus donor cell from which it was produced. This may have important implications for cross-species nuclear transfer in which nuclear-mitochondrial incompatibilities may lead to death.

Artificial ''embryo splitting'' or ''embryo twinning'', a technique that creates monozygotic twins from a single embryo, is not considered in the same fashion as other methods of cloning. During that procedure, a donor [[embryo]] is split in two distinct embryos, that can then be transferred via [[embryo transfer]]. It is optimally performed at the 6- to 8-cell stage, where it can be used as an expansion of [[IVF]] to increase the number of available embryos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Illmensee K, Levanduski M, Vidali A, Husami N, Goudas VT |title=Human embryo twinning with applications in reproductive medicine |journal=Fertil. Steril. |volume= 93|issue= 2|pages= 423–7|date=February 2009 |pmid=19217091 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2008.12.098 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If both embryos are successful, it gives rise to [[Monozygotic twins|monozygotic (identical) twins]].

[[Dolly (sheep)|Dolly]], a [[Finn-Dorset]] [[domestic sheep|ewe]], was the first mammal to have been successfully cloned from an adult somatic cell. Dolly was formed by taking a cell from the udder of her 6-year old biological mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rantala, Milgram|first=M., Arthur|title=Cloning: For and Against|year=1999|publisher=Carus Publishing Company|location=Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8126-9375-1|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dolly's embryo was created by taking the cell and inserting it into a sheep ovum.

Dolly was publicly significant because the effort showed that genetic material from a specific adult cell, programmed to express only a distinct subset of its genes, can be reprogrammed to grow an entirely new organism. Before this demonstration, it had been shown by John Gurdon that nuclei from differentiated cells could give rise to an entire organism after transplantation into an enucleated egg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gurdon J | journal=Dev. Biol. | date= Apr 1962 | volume=4| issue=2 | pages=256–73 | title=Adult frogs derived from the nuclei of single somatic cells | pmid= 13903027 | doi=10.1016/0012-1606(62)90043-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this concept was not yet demonstrated in a mammalian system.

The first mammalian cloning (resulting in Dolly the sheep) had a success rate of 29 embryos per 277 fertilized eggs, which produced three lambs at birth, one of which lived. In a bovine experiment involving 70 cloned calves, one-third of the calves died young. The first successfully cloned horse, [[Prometea]], took 814 attempts. Notably, although the first{{clarify|does this mean "first vertebrate"?|date=February 2016}} clones were frogs, no adult cloned frog has yet been produced from a somatic adult nucleus donor cell.

There were early claims that [[Dolly the sheep]] had pathologies resembling accelerated aging. Scientists speculated that Dolly's death in 2003 was related to the shortening of [[telomere]]s, DNA-protein complexes that protect the end of linear [[chromosome]]s. However, other researchers, including [[Ian Wilmut]] who led the team that successfully cloned Dolly, argue that Dolly's early death due to respiratory infection was unrelated to deficiencies with the cloning process. This idea that the nuclei have not irreversibly aged was shown in 2013 to be true for mice.&lt;ref name="Wakayama" /&gt;

Dolly was named after performer [[Dolly Parton]] because the cells cloned to make her were from a [[mammary gland]] cell, and Parton is known for her ample cleavage.&lt;ref name=BBCname&gt;BBC. 22 February 2008.

==== Human cloning ====
{{Main|Human cloning}}
Human cloning is the creation of a genetically identical copy of a human. The term is generally used to refer to artificial human cloning, which is the reproduction of human cells and tissues. It does not refer to the natural conception and delivery of [[monozygotic|identical]] [[multiple birth|twins]].  The possibility of human cloning has raised [[ethics of cloning|controversies]]. These ethical concerns have prompted several nations to pass [[legislation]] regarding human cloning and its legality. As of right now, scientists have no intention of trying to clone people and they believe their results should spark a wider discussion about the laws and regulations the world needs to regulate cloning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Martinez|first1=Bobby|title=WATCH: Scientists clone monkeys using technique that created Dolly the sheep|url=http://fox61.com/2018/01/25/watch-scientists-clone-monkeys-using-technique-that-created-dolly-the-sheep/|website=Fox61|publisher=fox61|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two commonly discussed types of theoretical human cloning are ''therapeutic cloning'' and ''reproductive cloning''. Therapeutic cloning would involve cloning cells from a human for use in medicine and transplants, and is an active area of research, but is not in medical practice anywhere in the world, {{as of|2014|lc=y}}. Two common methods of therapeutic cloning that are being researched are [[somatic-cell nuclear transfer]] and, more recently, [[Induced pluripotent stem cell|pluripotent stem cell induction]]. Reproductive cloning would involve making an entire cloned human, instead of just specific cells or tissues.&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 18523539 | volume=10 | issue=2 | title=Therapeutic cloning: promises and issues | pmc=2323472 | date=July 2007 | journal=Mcgill J Med | pages=112–20 | last1 = Kfoury | first1 = C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Ethical issues of cloning ====
{{Main|Ethics of cloning}}

There are a variety of [[bioethics|ethical]] positions regarding the possibilities of cloning, especially [[human cloning]]. While many of these views are [[religious]] in origin, the questions raised by cloning are faced by [[secular]] perspectives as well.  Perspectives on human cloning are theoretical, as human therapeutic and reproductive cloning are not commercially used; animals are currently cloned in laboratories and in livestock production.

Advocates support development of therapeutic cloning in order to generate tissues and whole organs to treat patients who otherwise cannot obtain transplants,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml#organsQ |title=Cloning Fact Sheet |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502125744/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/elsi/cloning.shtml |publisher=U.S. Department of Energy Genome Program |date=2009-05-11 |archivedate=2013-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; to avoid the need for [[immunosuppressive drugs]],&lt;ref name="ncbi.nlm.nih.gov"/&gt; and to stave off the effects of aging.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael (September 2007).

==== Cloning extinct and endangered species ====
Cloning, or more precisely, the reconstruction of functional DNA from [[extinct]] species has, for decades, been a dream.

In 2001, a cow named Bessie gave birth to a cloned Asian [[gaur]], an endangered species, but the calf died after two days. In 2003, a [[banteng]] was successfully cloned, followed by three African wildcats from a thawed frozen embryo. These successes provided hope that similar techniques (using surrogate mothers of another species) might be used to clone extinct species. Anticipating this possibility, tissue samples from the last ''bucardo'' ([[Pyrenean ibex]]) were frozen in [[liquid nitrogen]] immediately after it died in 2000. Researchers are also considering cloning endangered species such as the giant panda and cheetah.

In 2002, geneticists at the [[Australian Museum]] announced that they had replicated DNA of the [[thylacine]] (Tasmanian tiger), at the time extinct for about 65 years, using [[polymerase chain reaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/auspac/05/28/aust.thylacines/|title=Cloning to revive extinct species|first=Grant|last=Holloway|publisher=CNN.com|date=2002-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 15 February 2005 the museum announced that it was stopping the project after tests showed the specimens' DNA had been too badly degraded by the ([[ethanol]]) preservative. On 15 May 2005 it was announced that the thylacine project would be revived, with new participation from researchers in [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

In 2003, for the first time, an extinct animal, the Pyrenean ibex mentioned above was cloned, at the Centre of Food Technology and Research of Aragon, using the preserved frozen cell nucleus of the skin samples from 2001 and domestic goat egg-cells. The ibex died shortly after birth due to physical defects in its lungs.&lt;ref name="The Telegraph"&gt;{{cite news | title =Extinct ibex is resurrected by cloning | url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4409958/Extinct-ibex-is-resurrected-by-cloning.html | accessdate = 2009-02-01 |work = The Telegraph | location=London | first1=Richard | last1=Gray | first2=Roger | last2=Dobson | date=31 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most anticipated targets for cloning was once the [[woolly mammoth]], but attempts to extract DNA from frozen mammoths have been unsuccessful, though a joint Russo-Japanese team is currently working toward this goal.  In January 2011, it was reported by Yomiuri Shimbun that a team of scientists headed by Akira Iritani of Kyoto University had built upon research by Dr. Wakayama, saying that they will extract DNA from a mammoth carcass that had been preserved in a Russian laboratory and insert it into the egg cells of an African elephant in hopes of producing a mammoth embryo. The researchers said they hoped to produce a baby mammoth within six years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3075381.stm|title=Scientists 'to clone mammoth'|publisher=BBC News|date=2003-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-16068581 |title=BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was noted, however that the result, if possible, would be an elephant-mammoth hybrid rather than a true mammoth.&lt;ref name=rure&gt;[http://expert.ru/russian_reporter/2015/05/kogda-oni-vernutsya/ "Когда вернутся мамонты"] ("When the Mammoths Return"), February 5, 2015 (retrieved September 6, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is the survival of the reconstructed mammoth: [[ruminant]]s rely on a [[symbiosis]] with specific [[microbiota]] in their stomachs for digestion.&lt;ref name=rure/&gt;

Scientists at the [[University of Newcastle (Australia)|University of Newcastle]] and [[University of New South Wales]] announced in March 2013 that the very recently extinct [[gastric-brooding frog]] would be the subject of a cloning attempt to resurrect the species.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yong|first=Ed|title=Resurrecting the Extinct Frog with a Stomach for a Womb|website=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]|date=2013-03-15|url=http://phenomena.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/15/resurrecting-the-extinct-frog-with-a-stomach-for-a-womb/|accessdate=2013-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dolly the sheep was created from a six year old cell sample from a mammary gland. Because of this, she aged quicker than other naturally born animals because she was started from already aging cells. She died prematurely at six years old, not only from her age but from respiratory issues and severe arthritis. {{citation needed|date=August 2018}}{{dubious|date=August 2018}}

A detailed study released in 2016 and less detailed studies by others suggest that once cloned animals get past the first month or two of life they are generally healthy. However, early pregnancy loss and neonatal losses are still greater with cloning than natural conception or assisted reproduction (IVF). Current research is attempting to overcome these problems.&lt;ref name="BBCname" /&gt;

Discussion of cloning in the popular media often presents the subject negatively. In an article in the 8 November 1993 article of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', cloning was portrayed in a negative way, modifying Michelangelo's ''[[Creation of Adam]]'' to depict Adam with five identical hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIME Magazine – U.S. Edition –  Vol. 142 No. 19|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|accessdate=5 November 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171105153733/http://content.time.com/time/magazine/0,9263,7601931108,00.html|archivedate=5 November 2017|date=8 November 1993|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]''{{'s}} 10 March 1997 issue also critiqued the ethics of human cloning, and included a graphic depicting identical babies in beakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Today The Sheep…|journal=Newsweek|date=9 March 1997|url=http://www.newsweek.com/today-sheep-170570|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of cloning, particularly human cloning, has featured a wide variety of [[science fiction]] works. An early fictional depiction of cloning is [[Bokanovsky's Process]] which features in [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1931 dystopian novel ''[[Brave New World]]''. The process is applied to fertilized human [[Egg (biology)|eggs]] ''[[in vitro]]'', causing them to split into identical genetic copies of the original.&lt;ref&gt;Huxley, Aldous; "Brave New World and Brave New World Revisited"; p. 19; HarperPerennial, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bhelkar|first1=Ratnakar D.|title=Science Fiction: Fantasy and Reality|date=2009|publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist|isbn=9788126910366|page=58|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=bvt_NyXYGb0C&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;pg=PA58|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following renewed interest in cloning in the 1950s, the subject was explored further in works such as [[Poul Anderson]]'s 1953 story ''UN-Man'', which describes a technology called "exogenesis", and [[Gordon Rattray Taylor]]'s book ''[[The Biological Time Bomb]]'', which popularised the term "cloning" in 1963.&lt;ref name="stableford"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stableford|first1=Brian M.|title=Science Fact and Science Fiction: An Encyclopedia|date=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=9780415974608|pages=91–92|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uefwmdROKTAC&amp;lpg=PA92&amp;pg=PA91|language=en|chapter=Clone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning is a recurring theme in a number of contemporary science fiction films, ranging from action films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993), ''[[Alien Resurrection]]'' (1997), ''[[The 6th Day]]'' (2000), ''[[Resident Evil (film)|Resident Evil]]'' (2002), ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Star Wars: Episode II]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]'' (2005), to comedies such as [[Woody Allen]]'s 1973 film ''[[Sleeper (1973 film)|Sleeper]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070707/|title=Sleeper (1973)|author=planktonrules|date=17 December 1973|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of cloning is represented variously in fiction. Many works depict the artificial creation of humans by a method of growing cells from a tissue or DNA sample; the replication may be instantaneous, or take place through slow growth of human embryos in [[artificial womb]]s. In the long-running British television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the [[Fourth Doctor]] and his companion [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]] were cloned in a matter of seconds from DNA samples ("[[The Invisible Enemy (Doctor Who)|The Invisible Enemy]]", 1977) and then — in an apparent [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to the 1966 film ''[[Fantastic Voyage]]'' — shrunk to microscopic size in order to enter the Doctor's body to combat an alien virus. The clones in this story are short-lived, and can only survive a matter of minutes before they expire.&lt;ref name="muir"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muir|first1=John Kenneth|title=A Critical History of Doctor Who on Television|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9781476604541|pages=258–9|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qMKSCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;pg=PA259|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science fiction films such as ''[[The Matrix]]'' and ''Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones'' have featured scenes of human [[foetus]]es being cultured on an industrial scale in mechanical tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mumford|first1=James|title=Ethics at the Beginning of Life: A Phenomenological Critique|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0199673964|page=108|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UCnmRCDGJ0cC&amp;lpg=PA108&amp;pg=PA108|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cloning humans from body parts is also a common theme in science fiction. Cloning features strongly among the science fiction conventions parodied in Woody Allen's ''Sleeper'', the plot of which centres around an attempt to clone an assassinated dictator from his disembodied nose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Humber|first1=James M.|last2=Almeder|first2=Robert|title=Human Cloning|date=1998|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9781592592050|page=10|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vNGUBwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;pg=PA10|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2008 ''Doctor Who'' story "[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]", a duplicate version of the [[Tenth Doctor]] spontaneously grows from his severed hand, which had been cut off in a sword fight during an earlier episode.&lt;ref name="smithka"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lewis|first1=Courtland|last2=Smithka|first2=Paula|title=Doctor Who and Philosophy: Bigger on the Inside|date=2010|publisher=Open Court|isbn=9780812697254|pages=32–33|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ShPnLHcKqUwC&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=What's Continuity without Persistence?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the death of her beloved 14-year old Coton de Tulear named Samantha in late 2017, [[Barbra Streisand]] announced that she had cloned the dog, and was now "waiting for [the two cloned pups] to get older so [she] can see if they have [Samantha's] brown eyes and her seriousness." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/entertainment/streisand-dog-clone-1.4555800?cmp=rss|title=Twice as nice: Barbra Streisand cloned her beloved dog and has 2 new pups|work=CBC News|access-date=2018-03-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation cost $50,000 through the pet cloning company ViaGen.

===Cloning and identity===
Science fiction has used cloning, most commonly and specifically [[human cloning]], to raise the controversial questions of identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=Patrick|title=How Popular media represent cloning as an ethical problem|jstor=3527566|volume=28|issue=2|pages=6–13|doi=10.2307/3527566|pmid=9589288|journal=The Hastings Center Report|url=http://kie.georgetown.edu/nrcbl/documents/hcr/v28/h28n2p06.pdf|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csustan.edu/honors/documents/journals/thresholds/Delacruz.pdf |title=Yvonne A. De La Cruz '&amp;#39;Science Fiction Storytelling and Identity: Seeing the Human Through Android Eyes'&amp;#39; |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[A Number]]'' is a 2002 play by [[English people|English]] [[playwright]] [[Caryl Churchill]] which addresses the subject of human cloning and identity, especially [[nature and nurture]]. The story, set in the near future, is structured around the conflict between a father (Salter) and his sons (Bernard 1, Bernard 2, and Michael Black) – two of whom are clones of the first one. ''A Number'' was adapted by Caryl Churchill for television, in a co-production between the [[BBC]] and [[HBO Films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = Uma Thurman, Rhys Ifans and Tom Wilkinson star in two plays for BBC Two| publisher = BBC| date = 2008-06-19| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/06_june/19/stage.shtml| accessdate = 2008-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a Japanese television series named "Bunshin" was created. The story's main character, Mariko, is a woman studying child welfare in Hokkaido. She grew up always doubtful about the love from her mother, who looked nothing like her and who died nine years before. One day, she finds some of her mother's belongings at a relative's house, and heads to Tokyo to seek out the truth behind her birth. She later discovered that she was a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Review of Bunshin |url =http://doramaworld.blogspot.com/2012/06/review-of-bunshin.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2013 television series ''[[Orphan Black]]'', cloning is used as a scientific study on the behavioral adaptation of the clones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2234222/|title=Orphan Black (TV Series 2013– )|author=foreverbounds|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a similar vein, the book ''[[The Double (Saramago novel)|The Double]]'' by Nobel Prize winner [[José Saramago]] explores the emotional experience of a man who discovers that he is a clone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=John |last=Banville |title='The Double': The Tears of a Clone|work=The New York Times |date=2004-10-10|accessdate=14 January 2015 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/10/books/review/10BANV01.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning as resurrection===
Cloning has been used in fiction as a way of recreating historical figures. In the 1976 [[Ira Levin]] novel ''[[The Boys from Brazil (novel)|The Boys from Brazil]]'' and its [[The Boys from Brazil (film)|1978 film adaptation]], [[Josef Mengele]] uses cloning to create copies of [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0077269/|title=The Boys from Brazil (1978)|author=Christian Lee Pyle (CLPyle)|date=12 October 1978|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'', which spawned a [[Jurassic Park|series of ''Jurassic Park'' feature films]], a bioengineering company develops a technique to resurrect extinct species of [[dinosaur]]s by creating cloned creatures using DNA extracted from [[fossil]]s. The cloned dinosaurs are used to populate the Jurassic Park [[Animal theme park|wildlife park]] for the entertainment of visitors. The scheme goes disastrously wrong when the dinosaurs escape their enclosures. Despite being selectively cloned as females to prevent them from breeding, the dinosaurs develop the ability to reproduce through [[parthenogenesis]].&lt;ref name="cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohen|first1=Daniel|title=Cloning|date=2002|publisher=Millbrook Press|isbn=9780761328025|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TpBEOaHhb4oC&amp;lpg=PA73&amp;pg=PA73|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for warfare===
The use of cloning for military purposes has also been explored in several fictional works. In ''Doctor Who'', an alien race of armour-clad, warlike beings called [[Sontaran]]s was introduced in the 1973 serial "[[The Time Warrior]]". Sontarans are depicted as squat, bald creatures who have been genetically engineered for combat. Their weak spot is a "probic vent", a small socket at the back of their neck which is associated with the cloning process.&lt;ref name="thompson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thompson|first1=Dave|title=Doctor Who FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Most Famous Time Lord in the Universe|date=2013|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=9781480342958|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=QcEXAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT119&amp;pg=PT119|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of cloned soldiers being bred for combat was revisited in "[[The Doctor's Daughter]]" (2008), when the Doctor's DNA is used to create a female warrior called [[Jenny (Doctor Who)|Jenny]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barr|first1=Jason|last2=Mustachio|first2=Camille D. G.|title=The Language of Doctor Who: From Shakespeare to Alien Tongues|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442234819|page=219|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ImuYAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA219&amp;pg=PA219|accessdate=5 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' was set against the backdrop of a historical conflict called the [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)|Clone Wars]]. The events of this war were not fully explored until the prequel films ''[[Star Wars: Episode II – Attack of the Clones|Attack of the Clones]]'' (2002) and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III – Revenge of the Sith|Revenge of the Sith]]'' (2005), which depict a [[Space warfare in fiction|space war]] waged by a massive army of heavily armoured [[clone trooper]]s that leads to the foundation of the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]]. Cloned soldiers are "manufactured" on an industrial scale, genetically conditioned for obedience and combat effectiveness. It is also revealed that the popular character [[Boba Fett]] originated as a clone of [[Jango Fett]], a mercenary who served as the genetic template for the clone troopers.&lt;ref name="mcdonald"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Paul F.|title=The Star Wars Heresies: Interpreting the Themes, Symbols and Philosophies of Episodes I, II and III|date=2013|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786471812|pages=167–171|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Wf4CAQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA169&amp;pg=PA167|accessdate=4 November 2017|language=en|chapter=The Clones}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1185834/|title=Star Wars: The Clone Wars (2008)|author=compel_bast|date=15 August 2008|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning for exploitation===
A recurring sub-theme of cloning fiction is the use of clones as a supply of [[Organ (anatomy)|organs]] for [[Organ transplant|transplantation]]. The 2005 [[Kazuo Ishiguro]] novel ''[[Never Let Me Go (novel)|Never Let Me Go]]'' and the [[Never Let Me Go (2010 film)|2010 film adaption]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1334260/|title=Never Let Me Go (2010)|author=espenshade55|date=11 February 2011|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; are set in an [[alternate history]] in which cloned humans are created for the sole purpose of providing organ donations to naturally born humans, despite the fact that they are fully sentient and self-aware. The 2005 film ''[[The Island (2005 film)|The Island]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0399201/|title=The Island (2005)|date=22 July 2005|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolves around a similar plot, with the exception that the clones are unaware of the reason for their existence.

The exploitation of human clones for dangerous and undesirable work was examined in the 2009 British science fiction film ''[[Moon (film)|Moon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1182345/|title=Moon (2009)|author=larry-411|date=17 July 2009|website=IMDb|accessdate=3 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the futuristic novel ''[[Cloud Atlas (novel)|Cloud Atlas]]'' and subsequent [[Cloud Atlas (film)|film]], one of the story lines focuses on a genetically-engineered fabricant clone named Sonmi~451, one of millions raised in an artificial "wombtank," destined to serve from birth. She is one of thousands  created for manual and [[emotional labor]]; Sonmi herself works as a server in a restaurant. She later discovers that the sole source of food for clones, called 'Soap', is manufactured from the clones themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technewsdaily.com/8402-human-clones-cloud-atlas.html|title=Technology News – 2017 Innovations and Future Tech|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Anthropology}}

'''Cognitive anthropology''' is an approach within [[cultural anthropology]] in which scholars seek to explain patterns of shared knowledge, [[cultural]] [[innovation]], and transmission over time and space using the methods and [[theories]] of the [[cognitive sciences]] (especially [[experimental psychology]] and [[evolutionary biology]]) often through close collaboration with historians, ethnographers, archaeologists, linguists, musicologists and other specialists engaged in the description and [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of cultural forms. Cognitive anthropology is concerned with what people from different groups know and how that implicit knowledge, in the sense of what they think subconsciously, changes the way people perceive and relate to the world around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Cognitive anthropology has strong ties to [[ethnoscience]] and [[linguistics]].

==Scope==
Cognitive anthropology studies a range of domains including folk taxonomies, the interaction of language and thought, and cultural models.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From a linguistics stand-point, cognitive anthropology uses language as the doorway to study cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Quinn|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its general goal is to break language down to find commonalities in different cultures and the ways people perceive the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Colby|Fernandez|Kronenfeld|1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Linguistic study of cognitive anthropology may be broken down into three subfields: [[semantics]], [[syntactics]], and [[pragmatics]].

==Methods==
In contrast to traditional ethnographic methods in cultural anthropology, cognitive anthropology primarily uses quantitative methodologies in order to study culture. Because of the field's interest in determining shared knowledge, [[consensus analysis]] has been used as its most widely used statistical measure.&lt;ref&gt; {{Harvcoltxt|D'Andrade|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the techniques used is [[Cultural Network Analysis]], the drawing of networks of interrelated ideas that are widely shared among members of a population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Sieck|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there has been some interchange between cognitive anthropologists and those working in artificial intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Gomm|2009|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation with cognitive science==
Anthropology is one of six fields which contributed to the founding of [[cognitive science]]. However, anthropology has been criticised for being detached from cognitive science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bender|first1=Andrea|last2=Hutchins|first2=Edwin|last3=Medin|first3=Douglas|title=Anthropology in Cognitive Science|journal=Topics in Cognitive Science|date=8 March 2010|volume=2|issue=3|pages=374–385|doi=10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01082.x|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01082.x/abstract|accessdate=12 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plasticity.jpg|thumb|Nonlinear static analysis of a 3D structure subjected to plastic deformations]]

'''Computer-aided engineering''' ('''CAE''') is the broad usage of [[computer software]] to aid in [[engineering]] analysis tasks.  It includes {{nowrap|[[finite element analysis]] (FEA)}}, {{nowrap|[[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD)}}, {{nowrap|[[multibody dynamics]] (MBD)}}, [[durability]] and [[optimization]].

== Overview ==
Computer Softwares used to analyse CAD geometry tools that have been developed to support these activities are considered CAE tools. CAE tools are being used, for example, to analyse the robustness and performance of components and assemblies. The term encompasses simulation, [[verification and validation|validation]], and [[Process optimisation|optimisation]] of products and manufacturing tools. In the future, CAE systems will be major providers of information to help support design teams in decision making.  Computer-aided engineering is used in many fields such as automotive, aviation, space, and shipbuilding industries.&lt;ref name=saracoglu /&gt;

In regard to [[information network]]s, CAE systems are individually considered a single [[node (networking)|node]] on a total information network and each node may interact with other nodes on the network.

CAE systems can provide support to businesses. This is achieved by the use of reference architectures and their ability to place information views on the business process. Reference architecture is the basis from which information model, especially product and manufacturing models.

The term CAE has also been used by some in the past to describe the use of computer technology within engineering in a broader sense than just engineering analysis. It was in this context that the term was coined by  '''Jason Lemon''', founder of [[SDRC]] in the late 1970s. This definition is however better known today by the terms [[CAx]] and [[Product Lifecycle Management|PLM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marks|first1=Peter|title=2007: In Remembrance of Dr. Jason A. Lemon, CAE pioneer|url=http://gfxspeak.com/2011/07/08/in-remembrance-of-dr-jason-a-lemon-cae-pioneer/|website=gfxspeak.com|accessdate=2 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== CAE fields and phases ==
CAE areas covered include:
*[[Stress analysis]] on components and assemblies using [[Finite Element Analysis]] (FEA);
*Thermal and fluid flow analysis [[Computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD);
*[[Multibody dynamics]] (MBD) and [[Kinematics]];
*Analysis tools for process simulation for operations such as [[casting]], [[molding (process)|molding]], and die press forming.
*[[Multidisciplinary design optimization|Optimization]] of the product or process.

In general, there are three phases in any computer-aided engineering task:
*Pre-processing &amp;ndash; defining the model and environmental factors to be applied to it. (typically a finite element model, but facet, [[voxel]] and thin sheet methods are also used)
*Analysis solver (usually performed on high powered computers)
*Post-processing of results (using visualization tools)

This cycle is iterated, often many times, either manually or with the use of [[Multidisciplinary design optimization#Commercial MDO Tools|commercial optimization software]].

==CAE in the automotive industry==
CAE tools are very widely used in the [[automotive industry]]. In fact, their use has enabled the automakers to reduce product development cost and time while improving the safety, comfort, and durability of the vehicles they produce. The predictive capability of CAE tools has progressed to the point where much of the design verification is now done using computer simulations (diagnosis) rather than physical [[prototype]] testing. CAE dependability is based upon all proper assumptions as inputs and must identify critical inputs (BJ). Even though there have been many advances in CAE, and it is widely used in the engineering field, physical testing is still a must. It is used for verification and [[Finite element updating|model updating]], to accurately define loads and boundary conditions and for final prototype sign-off.

==The future of CAE in the product development process==
Even though CAE has built a strong reputation as a verification, troubleshooting and analysis tool, there is still a perception that sufficiently accurate results come rather late in the [[design cycle]] to really drive the design. This can be expected to become a problem as modern products become ever more complex. They include [[smart system]]s, which leads to an increased need for multi-physics analysis including [[Control System|controls]], and contain new lightweight materials, to which engineers are often less familiar. CAE software companies and manufacturers are constantly looking for tools and process improvements to change this situation. On the software side, they are constantly looking to develop more powerful solvers, better use computer resources and include engineering knowledge in pre- and post-processing. On the process side, they try to achieve a better alignment between 3D CAE, 1D System Simulation and physical testing. This should increase modeling realism and calculation speed. On top of that, they try to better integrate CAE in the overall [[Product lifecycle|product lifecycle management]]. In this way, they can connect product design with product use, which is an absolute must for smart products. Such an enhanced engineering process is also referred to as [[predictive engineering analytics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van der Auweraer|first1=Herman|last2=Anthonis|first2=Jan|last3=De Bruyne|first3=Stijn|last4=Leuridan|first4=Jan|title=Virtual engineering at work: the challenges for designing mechatronic products|journal=Engineering with computers|date=2012|volume=29|issue=3|pages=389–408|doi=10.1007/s00366-012-0286-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seong Wook Cho|last2=Seung Wook Kim|last3=Jin-Pyo Park|last4=Sang Wook Yang|last5=Young Choi|title=Engineering collaboration framework with CAE analysis data|journal=International Journal of Precision Engineering and Manufacturing|date=2011|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Configuration management''' ('''CM''') is a [[systems engineering]] process for establishing and maintaining consistency of a product's performance, functional, and physical attributes with its requirements, design, and operational information throughout its life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=202239 |title=''MIL-HDBK-61A, ""Military Handbook: Configuration Management Guidance'' |publisher=Department of Defense |date=7 February 2001 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320093634/https://assist.daps.dla.mil/quicksearch/basic_profile.cfm?ident_number=202239 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geia.org/ANSI-EIA-649-A-Standard----NATIONAL-CONSENSUS-STANDARD-FOR-CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT- |title=''ANSI/EIA-649B, ""National Consensus Standard for Configuration Management'' |publisher=TechAmerica |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=2012-03-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801125835/http://www.geia.org/ANSI-EIA-649-A-Standard----NATIONAL-CONSENSUS-STANDARD-FOR-CONFIGURATION-MANAGEMENT- |archivedate=1 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The CM process is widely used by military engineering organizations to manage changes throughout the [[system lifecycle]] of [[complex system]]s, such as [[weapon]] systems, [[military vehicles]], and [[information system]]s. Outside the military, the CM process is also used with IT service management as defined by [[ITIL]], and with other [[domain model]]s in the civil engineering and other [[industrial engineering]] segments such as roads, bridges, [[canal]]s, dams, and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History and Heritage of Civil Engineering |work=[[American Society of Civil Engineers|ASCE]] |url=http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216235716/http://live.asce.org/hh/index.mxml?versionChecked=true |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 February 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-08 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institution of Civil Engineers What is Civil Engineering |work=[[Institution of Civil Engineers|ICE]] |url=http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//little_book_full_colour.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060923023137/http://www.ice.org.uk/downloads//little_book_full_colour.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2006-09-23 |accessdate=2007-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management and the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) National Lessons Learned Program''|work=Federal Transportation Administration|url=http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/FTA-National-Lessons-Learned-Program.aspx|accessdate=2007-09-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120907165342/http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/FTA-National-Lessons-Learned-Program.aspx|archivedate=7 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
CM applied over the life cycle of a system provides visibility and control of its performance, functional, and physical attributes. CM verifies that a system performs as intended, and is identified and documented in sufficient detail to support its projected life cycle. The CM process facilitates orderly management of system information and system changes for such beneficial purposes as to revise capability; improve performance, reliability, or maintainability; extend life; reduce cost; reduce risk and liability; or correct defects. The relatively minimal cost of implementing CM is returned many fold in cost avoidance. The lack of CM, or its ineffectual implementation, can be very expensive and sometimes can have such catastrophic consequences such as failure of equipment or loss of life.

CM emphasizes the functional relation between parts, subsystems, and systems for effectively controlling system change. It helps to verify that proposed changes are systematically considered to minimize adverse effects. Changes to the system are proposed, evaluated, and implemented using a standardized, systematic approach that ensures consistency, and proposed changes are evaluated in terms of their anticipated impact on the entire system. CM verifies that changes are carried out as prescribed and that documentation of items and systems reflects their true configuration. A complete CM program includes provisions for the storing, tracking, and updating of all system information on a component, subsystem, and system basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |title=''Systems Engineering Fundamentals'' |publisher=Defense Acquisition University Press |date=January 2001 |accessdate=2012-03-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211165311/http://www.dau.mil/pubs/pdf/SEFGuide%2001-01.pdf |archivedate=11 February 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A structured CM program ensures that documentation (e.g., requirements, design, test, and acceptance documentation) for items is accurate and consistent with the actual physical design of the item. In many cases, without CM, the documentation exists but is not consistent with the item itself. For this reason, engineers, contractors, and management are frequently forced to develop documentation reflecting the actual status of the item before they can proceed with a change. This [[reverse engineering]] process is wasteful in terms of human and other resources and can be minimized or eliminated using CM.

==History==
Configuration Management originated in the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the 1950s as a technical management discipline for hardware material items—and it is now a standard practice in virtually every industry. The CM process became its own technical discipline sometime in the late 1960s when the DoD developed a series of [[United States Military Standard|military standards]] called the "480 series" (i.e., MIL-STD-480, MIL-STD-481 and MIL-STD-483) that were subsequently issued in the 1970s. In 1991, the "480 series" was consolidated into a single standard known as the MIL–STD–973 that was then replaced by MIL–HDBK–61 pursuant to a general DoD goal that reduced the number of military standards in favor of industry [[technical standards]] supported by [[standards organization|standards developing organizations]] (SDO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |title=''Memorandum, Specifications and Standards – A New Way of Doing Business'' |publisher=Secretary of Defense |date=29 June 1994 |accessdate=2012-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021123641/https://acc.dau.mil/CommunityBrowser.aspx?id=32397 |archivedate=21 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This marked the beginning of what has now evolved into the most widely distributed and accepted standard on CM, [[ANSI–EIA–649]]–1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.wcupa.edu/~yang/495ppt/config_management.pdf |title=''Configuration Management Compliance Validation: Critical Review and Technology Assessment(CR/TA)Report'' |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |date= |accessdate=14 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now widely adopted by numerous organizations and agencies, the CM discipline's concepts include [[systems engineering]] (SE), [[Integrated Logistics Support]] (ILS), [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI), [[ISO 9000]], [[Prince2]] project management method, [[COBIT]], [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] (ITIL), [[product lifecycle management]], and [[Application Lifecycle Management]].  Many of these functions and models have redefined CM from its traditional holistic approach to technical management. Some treat CM as being similar to a librarian activity, and break out change control or change management as a separate or stand alone discipline.

==Overview==

CM is the practice of handling changes systematically so that a [[system]] maintains its [[system integrity | integrity]] over time. CM implements the policies, procedures, techniques, and tools that manage, evaluate proposed changes, track the status of changes, and maintain an inventory of system and support documents as the system changes. CM programs and plans provide technical and administrative direction to the development and implementation of the procedures, functions, services, tools, processes, and resources required to successfully develop and support a complex system. During system development, CM allows [[program management]] to track requirements throughout the life-cycle through acceptance and operations and maintenance. As changes inevitably occur in the requirements and design, they must be approved and documented, creating an accurate record of the system status. Ideally the CM process is applied throughout the [[system lifecycle]]. Most professionals mix up or get confused with [[Asset management]] (AM), where it inventories the assets on hand. The key difference between CM and AM is that the former does not manage the financial accounting aspect but on service that the system supports.

The CM process for both hardware- and software-configuration items comprises five distinct disciplines as established in the MIL–HDBK–61A&lt;ref&gt;
Compare: {{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;
and in ANSI/EIA-649. These disciplines are carried out{{by whom?|date=July 2016}} as policies and procedures for establishing [[Baseline_(configuration_management)|baselines]] and for performing a standard [[change management | change-management]] process.  The [[IEEE 12207]] process IEEE 12207.2 also has these activities and adds "Release management and delivery".

The five disciplines are:

# CM Planning and Management: a formal document and plan to guide the CM program that includes items such as: 
#* personnel
#* responsibilities and resources
#* training requirements
#* administrative meeting guidelines, including a definition of procedures and tools
#* baselining processes
#* configuration control and configuration-status accounting
#* naming conventions
#* audits and reviews
#* subcontractor/vendor CM requirements
# Configuration Identification (CI): consists of setting and maintaining baselines, which define the system or subsystem architecture, components, and any developments at any point in time. It is the basis by which changes to any part of a system are identified, documented, and later tracked through design, development, testing, and final delivery. CI incrementally establishes and maintains the definitive current basis for Configuration Status Accounting (CSA) of a system and its [[configuration item]]s (CIs) throughout their lifecycle (development, production, deployment, and operational support) until disposal.
# Configuration Control: includes the evaluation of all change-requests and change-proposals, and their subsequent approval or disapproval. It covers the process of controlling modifications to the system's design, hardware, firmware, software, and documentation.
# Configuration Status Accounting: includes the process of recording and reporting configuration item descriptions (e.g., hardware, software, firmware, etc.) and all departures from the baseline during design and production. In the event of suspected problems, the verification of baseline configuration and approved modifications can be quickly determined.
# Configuration Verification and Audit: an independent review of hardware and software for the purpose of assessing compliance with established performance requirements, commercial and appropriate military standards, and functional, allocated, and product baselines. Configuration audits verify that the system and subsystem configuration documentation complies with the functional and physical performance characteristics before acceptance into an architectural baseline.

==Software==
{{main|Software configuration management}}

The traditional software configuration management (SCM) process is looked upon by practitioners as the best solution to handling changes in software projects. It identifies the functional and physical attributes of software at various points in time, and performs systematic control of changes to the identified attributes for the purpose of maintaining software integrity and traceability throughout the software development life cycle.

The SCM process further defines the need to trace changes, and the ability to verify that the final delivered software has all of the planned enhancements that are supposed to be included in the release. It identifies four procedures that must be defined for each software project to ensure that a sound SCM process is implemented. They are:
#Configuration identification
#Configuration control
#Configuration status accounting
#Configuration audits

These terms and definitions change from standard to standard, but are essentially the same.

*Configuration identification is the process of identifying the attributes that define every aspect of a configuration item.  A configuration item is a product (hardware and/or software) that has an end-user purpose.  These attributes are recorded in configuration documentation and baselined. [[Baseline (configuration management)|Baselining]] an attribute forces formal configuration change control processes to be effected in the event that these attributes are changed.
*Configuration change control is a set of processes and approval stages required to change a configuration item's attributes and to re-baseline them.
*Configuration status accounting is the ability to record and report on the configuration baselines associated with each configuration item at any moment of time.
*Configuration audits are broken into functional and [[physical configuration audit]]s.  They occur either at delivery or at the moment of effecting the change.  A functional configuration audit ensures that functional and performance attributes of a configuration item are achieved, while a physical configuration audit ensures that a configuration item is installed in accordance with the requirements of its detailed design documentation.

=== Configuration management database ===
The [[Information Technology Infrastructure Library]] (ITIL) specifies the use of a Configuration management system (CMS) or [[Configuration management database]] (CMDB) as a means of achieving industry best practices for Configuration Management.  CMDBs are used to track Configuration Items (CIs) and the dependencies between them, where CIs represent the things in an enterprise that are worth tracking and managing, such as but not limited to computers, software, software licenses, racks, network devices, storage, and even the components within such items.

The benefits of a CMS/CMDB includes being able to perform functions like root cause analysis, impact analysis, change management, and current state assessment for future state strategy development. Example systems, commonly identifies themselves as [[IT service management|IT Service Management (ITSM)]] systems, include FreshService, ServiceNow and Samanage.

=== Information assurance ===
For [[information assurance]], CM can be defined as the management of security features and assurances through control of changes made to hardware, software, firmware, documentation, test, test fixtures, and test documentation throughout the life cycle of an information system.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Information Systems Security Glossary]]&lt;/ref&gt; CM for information assurance, sometimes referred to as '''S'''ecure '''C'''onfiguration '''M'''anagement, relies upon performance, functional, and physical attributes of IT platforms and products and their environments to determine the appropriate security features and assurances that are used to measure a system configuration state. For example, configuration requirements may be different for a [[network firewall]] that functions as part of an organization's Internet boundary versus one that functions as an internal local [[network firewall]].

==Maintenance systems==

Configuration management is used to maintain an understanding of the status of complex assets with a view to maintaining the highest level of serviceability for the lowest cost. Specifically, it aims to ensure that operations are not disrupted due to the asset (or parts of the asset) overrunning limits of planned lifespan or below quality levels.

In the military, this type of activity is often classed as "mission readiness", and seeks to define which assets are available and for which type of mission; a classic example is whether aircraft on board an aircraft carrier are equipped with bombs for ground support or missiles for defense.

===Operating System configuration management===
Configuration management can be used to maintain [[Operating system|OS]] configuration files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=C. Lueninghoener|title=Getting Started with Configuration Management. ;login: issue:  April 2011, Volume 36, Number 2|url=https://www.usenix.org/system/files/login/articles/105457-Lueninghoener.pdf|accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Example systems include [[Ansible (software)|Ansible]], [[Bcfg2]], [[CFEngine]], [[Chef (software)|Chef]], [[Otter (software)|Otter]], [[Puppet (software)|Puppet]], [[Quattor]], [[SaltStack]], and [[Vagrant (software)|Vagrant]].

A theory of configuration maintenance was worked out by [[Mark Burgess (computer scientist)|Mark Burgess]],&lt;ref&gt;M. Burgess, Cfengine: a site configuration engine, USENIX Computing systems, Vol8, No. 3 1995 [https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/compsystems/1995/sum_burgess.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.

Burgess, Configurable immunity for evolving human-computer systems, Science of Computer Programming 51 2004, p197-213 [http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/immunity.pdf pdf] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303000000/http://research.iu.hio.no/papers/immunity.pdf |date=3 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a practical implementation on present day computer systems in the software [[CFEngine]] able to perform real time repair as well as preventive maintenance.

===Preventive maintenance===
{{Main|Preventive maintenance}}
Understanding the "as is" state of an asset and its major components is an essential element in preventive maintenance as used in maintenance, repair, and overhaul and [[enterprise asset management]] systems.

Complex assets such as aircraft, ships, industrial machinery etc. depend on many different components being serviceable. This serviceability is often defined in terms of the amount of usage the component has had since it was new, since fitted, since repaired, the amount of use it has had over its life and several other limiting factors. Understanding how near the end of their life each of these components is has been a major undertaking involving labor-intensive record keeping until recent developments in software.

===Predictive maintenance===
{{Main|Predictive maintenance}}
Many types of component use electronic sensors to capture data which provides live [[condition monitoring]]. This data is analyzed on board or at a remote location by computer to evaluate its current serviceability and increasingly its likely future state using algorithms which predict potential future failures based on previous examples of failure through field experience and modeling. This is the basis for "predictive maintenance".

Availability of accurate and timely data is essential in order for CM to provide operational value and a lack of this can often be a limiting factor. Capturing and disseminating the operating data to the various support organizations is becoming an industry in itself.

The consumers of this data have grown more numerous and complex with the growth of programs offered by original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). These are designed to offer operators guaranteed availability and make the picture more complex with the operator managing the asset but the OEM taking on the liability to ensure its serviceability.

==Construction==
More recently configuration management has been applied to large construction projects which can often be very complex and have a huge amount of details and changes that need to be documented. Construction agencies such as the Federal Highway Administration have used configuration management for their infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management for Transportation Management Systems Handbook''|work=Federal Highway Administration |url=http://www.everyspec.com/DOT/FHWA-OP-04-013_SEP2003_41209/ |accessdate=28 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are construction-based configuration management tools that aim to document change orders and RFIs in order to ensure a project stays on schedule and on budget. These programs can also store information to aid in the maintenance and modification of the infrastructure when it is completed.  One such application, ccsNet, was tested in a case study funded by the Federal Transportation Administration (FTA) in which the efficacy of configuration management was measured through comparing the approximately 80% complete construction of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Agency (LACMTA) 1st and 2nd segments of the Red Line, a $5.3&amp;nbsp;billion rail construction project.  This study yielded results indicating a benefit to using configuration management on projects of this nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Configuration Management Case Study''|work=PACO Technologies, Inc|url=http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/Case-Study.aspx|accessdate=28 March 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826174139/http://www.pacotechnologies.com/Pages/Case-Study.aspx|archivedate=26 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Timothy|title=Impact of past crises on current crisis communications: Insights from: Situational crisis communication theory|journal=Journal of Business Communication|year=2004|volume=41|pages=265–289|doi=10.1177/0021943604265607}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 February 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''crisis''' “should be reserved for serious events that require careful attention from management.”{{sfn|Coombs|2012|p=19}}

[[Crisis management]] has been defined as "a set of factors designed to combat crises and to lessen the actual damages inflicted."{{sfn|Coombs|2007|p=5}} Crisis management should not merely be reactionary; it should also consist of preventative measures and preparation in anticipation of potential crises. Effective crisis management has the potential to greatly reduce the amount of damage the organization receives as a result of the crisis, and may even prevent an incident from ever developing into a crisis.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|p=19}}

== Theories in crisis communication research ==
In crisis communication literature, several streams of research exist at the same time. Different theories demonstrate certain ways to look at and explain crisis situations.

=== Image repair theory (IRT) ===
William  established [[Image restoration theory|image repair theory]] (IRT) based on apologia studies. IRT assumes that image is an asset that a person or an organization attempts to protect during a crisis. When the person or the organization is attacked, the accused should draft messages to repair its image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Accounts, Excuses, and Apologies|last = Benoit|first = William L.|publisher = SUNY Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1438453989|location = Albany:NY|pages =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Benoit further introduced 5 general and 14 specific response strategies the accused could harness during a crisis. General categories include deny, evading responsibility, reducing offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Account, Excuses, and Aplogies|last=Benoit|first=William L.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2014|isbn=978-1438453989|location=Albany:NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) ===
Timothy Coombs started working on [[Situational crisis communication theory|situational crisis communication theory (SCCT)]] in 1995. Originated from [[Attribution (psychology)|attribution theory]], SCCT assumes that crises are negative events that stakeholders attempt to attribute responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Coombs|first = W.Timothy|date = 1995|title = Choosing the right words the development of guidelines for the selection of the "appropriate" crisis-response strategies|url = http://mcq.sagepub.com/content/8/4/447.full.pdf|journal = Management Communication Quarterly|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coombs believes crisis managers can employ different crisis strategies according to different crisis types. Different from IRT, SCCT is an audience-oriented theory which focuses on stakeholders’ perceptions of crisis situations. This idea is in line with Benoit’s argument that crisis concerns more about perception than reality.

=== Social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) model ===
As social networks and blogs become popular, people spend more time online during crises. Social-mediated crisis communication (SMCC) model is introduced to investigate crisis management in online context. The model first explains how the source and form of information affect response selections and then proposes crisis response strategies. The model argues that five factors influence an organizations’ communication during a crisis: crisis origin, crisis type, infrastructure, message strategy, and message form.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Liu|first = Brooke Fisher|date = 2011|title = How publics respond to crisis communication strategies: The interplay of information form and source|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811111000956|journal = Public Relations Review|doi =10.1016/j.pubrev.2011.08.004|pmid =|access-date =|volume=37|pages=345–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Integrated crisis mapping (ICM) model ===
Another line of crisis communication research focuses on stakeholders’ emotional changes in times of crises. Jin, Pang, and Cameron introduces integrated crisis mapping (ICM) model to understand stakeholders’ varied emotion during a crisis. ICM assumes that people keep interpreting their emotions during a crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Jin|first = Yan|last2 = Pang|first2 = Augustine|last3 = Cameron|first3 = Glen T.|date = 2012|title = The role of emotions in crisis responses: Inaugural test of the integrated crisis mapping (ICM) model|url = https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Glen_Cameron/publication/235252414_The_role_of_emotions_in_crisis_responses_Inaugural_test_of_the_integrated_crisis_mapping_(ICM)_model/links/00b49529cdb385a510000000.pdf|journal = Journal of Public Relations Research|doi =|pmid =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Covariation-based approach to crisis communication ===
As an extension of SCCT, Andreas Schwarz suggested to apply Kelley's covariation principle (attribution theory) more consistently in crisis communication to better explain the emergence and perception of causal attributions in crisis situations and deduce certain information strategies from this model and/or according findings. In this approach the three informational dimensions of consensus, distinctiveness, and consistency are conceptualized for situations of organizational crises (or other types of crisis) to predict the likelihood of stakeholders to make organizational attributions, entity attributions, or circumstance attributions and subsequently influence responsibility perceptions and evaluations of organizational reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwarz|first=Andreas|date=2012|title=Stakeholder attributions in crises: the effects of covariation information and attributional inferences on organizational reputation|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1553118X.2011.596869|journal=International Journal of Strategic Communication|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.1080/1553118X.2011.596869|pmid=|access-date=1 September 2016|via=|pages=174–195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discourse of renewal ===
The [[discourse of renewal]] theory examines the components an organization can employ when navigating a crisis in order to mitigate significant issues within the organization when entering the post-crisis stage. It is a theory assessed by Gregory Ulmer, Timothy Sellnow, and Matthew Seeger as a framework that "emphasizes learning from the crisis, ethical communication, communication that is prospective in nature, and effective organizational rhetoric".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/855491795|title=Effective crisis communication : moving from crisis to opportunity|last=1969-|first=Ulmer, Robert R.,|others=Sellnow, Timothy L.

==Categories of crisis management==

Coombs identifies three phases of [[crisis management]].{{sfn|Coombs|2007}}

#''Pre-crisis'': preparing ahead of time for crisis management in an effort to prevent a future crisis from occurring.{{sfn|Coombs|2007}} This category is also sometimes called the ''prodromal'' crisis stage.{{sfn|Finks|1986|p=21}}
#''Crisis'': the response to an actual crisis event.{{sfn|Coombs|2007}}
#''Post-crisis'': occurs after the crisis has been resolved; the efforts by the crisis management team to understand why the crisis occurred and to learn from the event.{{sfn|Coombs|2007}}

Inside the management step, Bodeau-Ostermann identifies 6 successive phases:
- reaction, where the group behaves on first sight,
- extension, because the crisis dilutes itself and touches neighbours,
- means (material and human), which constitutes an overview of success/failures of emergency reaction,
- focus, stands as a concrete action or event on which the team leaders concentrate to fight crisis,
- retraction, is the moment where the group diminishes means involved, in accordance with its aims,
- rehabilitation, where, as a last step, result is, for the group, emergence of new values, stronger than the older.

== Crisis response strategy ==
Both situational crisis communication theory and image repair theory assume organizations should protect their reputation and image through appropriate responses to the crisis. Therefore, how to draft effective message to defend the crisis becomes the focal point of crisis communication research. Image repair theory provides series of options that organizations usually adopt including denial, evade responsibility, reduce offensiveness, corrective action, and mortification. Specifically, denial strategy contains two sub-strategies, simple denial and shift blame. Evade responsibility strategy includes provocation, defeasibility, accident, good intention. Reduce offensiveness strategy garners bolstering, minimization, differentiation, transcendence, attack accuser, and compensation.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

SCCT also offers a handful of strategies: denial, scapegoat, attack the accuser, excuse, justification, ingratiation, concern, compassion, regret, apology. Coombs argues different strategy should be adopted according different situations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Crisis communication tactics==

=== Pre-crisis ===

* Researching and collecting information about crisis risks specific to the organization.
* Creating a crisis management plan that includes making decisions ahead of time about who will handle specific aspects of a crisis if and when it occurs. 
* Conducting exercises to test the plan at least annually.&lt;ref name="Coombs"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.instituteforpr.org/crisis-management-communications/|title = Crisis Management and Communications|last = Coombs|first = W. Timothy|date =|website =|publisher =|access-date =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Preparing [[press release]] templates for the organization’s [[public relations]] team in the event of a crisis.
* The chain of command that all employees will follow in the dissemination of information to all [[publics]] during a crisis situation.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|p=20}} 
A rapid response crisis communications team should be organized during the pre-crisis stage &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alfonso|first=González-Herrero|author2=Smith, Suzanne|title=Crisis Communications Management on the Web: How Internet-Based Technologies are Changing the Way Public Relations Professionals Handle Business Crises|journal=Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management|date=2008|volume=16|issue=3|pages=143–153|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1468-5973.2008.00543.x/abstract|accessdate=28 February 2014|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5973.2008.00543.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all individuals who will help with the actual crisis communication response should be trained.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|pp=20-21}} At this stage the communication professional focuses on detecting and identifying possible risks that could result in a crisis.

=== In-crisis ===

Crisis communication tactics during the crisis stage may include the following: the identification of the incident as a crisis by the organization’s crisis management team; the collection and processing of pertinent information to the crisis management team for decision making; and also the dissemination of crisis messages to both internal and external publics of the organization.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|pp=20-21}}

=== Post-crisis ===

* Reviewing and dissecting the successes and failures of the crisis management team in order to make any necessary changes to the organization, its employees, practices, or procedures.
* Providing follow-up crisis messages as necessary.{{sfn|Coombs|2012|pp=20-21}}
Timothy Coombs proposes that post-crisis communication should include the following five steps:
* Deliver all information promised to stakeholders as soon as that information is known.
* Keep stakeholders updated on the progression of recovery efforts including any corrective measures being taken and the progress of investigations.
* Analyze the crisis management effort for lessons and integrate those lessons in to the organization’s crisis management system.
* Scan the Internet channels for online memorials.
* Consult with victims and their families to determine the organization’s role in any anniversary events or memorials.&lt;ref name="Coombs"/&gt;
In general, Timothy Coombs raises some practices regarding to crisis response strategy based on SCCT that crisis managers should consider carefully.
* All victims or potential victims should receive instructing information, including recall information. This is one-half of the base response to a crisis.
* All victims should be provided an expression of sympathy, any information about corrective actions and trauma counseling when needed. This can be called the “care response.” This is the second-half of the base response to a crisis.
* For crises with minimal attributions of crisis responsibility and no intensifying factors, instructing information and care response is sufficient.
* For crises with minimal attributions of crisis responsibility and an intensifying factor, add excuse and/or justification strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* For crises with low attributions of crisis responsibility and no intensifying factors, add excuse and/or justification strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* For crises with low attributions of crisis responsibility and an intensifying factor, add compensation and/or apology strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* For crises with strong attributions of crisis responsibility, add compensation and/or apology strategies to the instructing information and care response.
* The compensation strategy is used anytime victims suffer serious harm.
* The reminder and ingratiation strategies can be used to supplement any response.
* Denial and attack the accuser strategies are best used only for rumor and challenge crises.

== Benoit's 5 Major Strategies ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2018}}

=== Denial ===
There are two forms of denial: Simple denial which involves denying the involvement or the act, and shifting the blame, which is also known as [[Scapegoating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://emiltowner.com/2007/05/31/benoits-five-major-strategies-2/|title=Benoit’s Five Major Strategies|date=2007-05-31|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=July 2018}}

=== Evasion of Responsibility ===
Evading responsibility involves the following 4 steps. 
# Provocation, suggesting that the accused only responded after being provoked. 
# Defeasibility, suggesting that lack of control or information is to blame. 
# Accidents, suggesting that it was an accident
# Good intentions, suggest that it was done with good intentions in mind, despite the negative outcome. 

=== Reducing ===
The apologists will attempt to reduce the offensiveness of the acts by: 
* Bolstering by describing positive attributes
* Minimizing to decrease the negative view of the situation
* Differentiation by comparing the act to other similar acts that ended in worse terms 
* Transcending by discussion in terms of abstract values and group loyalty.  
* Attacking the accuser in an attempt to eliminate credibility 
* Offering compensation to victims 

=== Corrective Action ===
The apologist will express corrective action when they attempt to correct the situation and prevent it from ever happening again. 

=== Mortification ===
When the apologist admits wrongful behavior and asks for forgiveness while apologizing. 

== Crisis communication dilemma ==
An increasing number of studies are investigating "[[stealing thunder]]". The concept originates from law, which indicates that lawyers report flaws in their own cases instead of giving the opponent opportunities to find the flaw. Journal articles frequently demonstrates the advantage of adopting "stealing thunder" strategy in minimizing reputational loss during crises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Claeys|first=An-sofie|last2=Cauberghe|first2=Verolien|date=2012|title=Crisis response and crisis timing strategies, two sides of the same coin|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0363811111001317|journal=Public Relations Review|doi=10.1016/j.pubrev.2011.09.001|pmid=|access-date=|volume=38|pages=83–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue organizations should report the problems first.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Spence|first1=P.

Companies are unwilling to disclose their crisis because there is a chance that the public will never know.

In [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], especially the study of [[mechanics]] and [[fluid dynamics]], the '''d'Alembert-Euler condition''' is a requirement that the [[streakline]]s of a flow are [[irrotational]].  Let '''x'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;'''x'''('''X''',''t'') be the coordinates of the point '''x''' into which '''X''' is carried at time ''t'' by a (fluid) flow.  Let &lt;math&gt;\ddot{\mathbf{x}}=\frac{D^2\mathbf{x}}{Dt}&lt;/math&gt; be the second [[material derivative]] of '''x'''.  Then the d'Alembert-Euler condition is:
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{curl}\  \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The d'Alembert-Euler condition is named for [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] and [[Leonhard Euler]] who independently first described its use in the mid-18th century.  It is not to be confused with the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations|Cauchy–Riemann conditions]].

A '''designer baby''' is a human [[embryo]] which has been [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]], usually following guidelines set by the parent or scientist, to produce desirable traits. This is done using [[germinal choice technology|various methods]], such as [[human germline engineering|germline engineering]] or [[preimplantation genetic diagnosis]] (PGD). This technology is the subject of ethical debate, bringing up the concept of genetically modified "superhumans" to interbreed with and eventually replace modern humans.

==Preimplantation genetic diagnosis==
{{Main article|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}

In [[medicine]] and (clinical) [[genetics]] '''pre-implantation genetic diagnosis''' (PGD or PIGD) (also known as '''embryo screening''') is a procedure performed on [[embryo]]s  prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]], sometimes even on [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Fertilisation|fertilization]]. The methods of PGD help to identify and locate genetic defects in early embryos that were conceived through [[In vitro fertilisation|in vitro fertilization]] (IVF).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stankovic|first=Bratislav|date=2005-02-07|title='It's a Designer Baby!' - Opinions on Regulation of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis|ssrn=1756573|location=Rochester, NY|publisher=Social Science Research Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IVF procedure is carried out by the removal of one or two cells when the embryo is at a specific stage in development. The PGD uses the IVF technique to obtain [[oocyte]]s or [[embryo]]s for evaluation of the organism's genome.

The PGD procedures allow scientists to identify damaged or mutated genes associated with diseases in the oocytes or embryos by using [[In situ hybridization|in-situ hybridization]] (ISH).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=Mark|year=2008|title=Designer babies’ and Harm to Supernumerary Embryos|url=|journal=American Philosophical Quarterly|volume=45.4|pages=349–364|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ISH technique labels specific nucleic acid sequences on a gene that can help detect genetic abnormalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bishop|first=Ryan|year=2010|title=Applications of Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) in Detecting Genetic Aberrations of Medical Significance|url=|journal=Bioscience Horizons|volume=3.1|pages=85–95|via=|doi=10.1093/biohorizons/hzq009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, this technique can also help select for desirable traits by avoiding implanting embryos with genes that have serious diseases or disabilities. Examples of desirable traits that could be selected would be increased muscle mass, voice pitch, or high intelligence. Overall, the procedure of PGD to select for a positive trait is referred to the creation of a "designer baby".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This is not a new technology - the first PGD babies, and thus also the first designer babies were created in 1989 and born in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Handyside AH, Kontogianni EH, Hardy K, Winston RM |title=Pregnancies from biopsied human preimplantation embryos sexed by Y-specific DNA amplification |journal=Nature |volume=344 |issue=6268 |pages=768–70 |year=1990 |pmid=2330030 |doi=10.1038/344768a0 |bibcode=1990Natur.344..768H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 article by Carolyn Abraham in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' stated that "Recent breakthroughs have made it possible to scan every chromosome in a single embryonic cell, to test for genes involved in hundreds of 'conditions,' some of which are clearly life-threatening while others are less dramatic and less certain". There is already a "[[DNA microarray|microchip]] that can test a remarkable 1,500 genetic traits at once, including [[heart disease]], [[seasonal affective disorder]], [[obesity]], [[Athletics (U.S.)|athletic]] ability, [[Human hair color|hair]] and [[eye color]], [[Human height|height]], susceptibility to [[alcohol]] and [[nicotine]] addictions, [[lactose intolerance]] and one of several genes linked to [[intelligence]]. It is still difficult to get enough DNA for such extensive testing but the chip designer thinks this technical problem will be solved soon.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Abraham, [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/pregnancy/pregnancy-trends/unnatural-selection-is-evolving-reproductive-technology-ushering-in-a-new-age-of-eugenics/article2294636/singlepage/ Unnatural selection: Is evolving reproductive technology ushering in a new age of eugenics?],  January  07, 2012, ''The Globe and Mail''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation of Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis===
PGD has been used primarily for medical purposes, but as the possibilities of the procedure increase the idea of non-medical uses has become a popular topic of debate. Non-medical motivations could lead to potential problems when trying to make the distinction of when the procedure is needed or desired.

For example, PGD has the ability to select an embryo based on gender preferences (Stankovic). Since changing a gender is not needed, but desired this could cause much controversy. Additionally, the procedure is able to create a donor offspring or a “savior sibling”, which can assist a pre-existing offspring for medical purposes.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The “savior sibling” is a brother or sister that is created to donate life-saving tissue to an existing child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sheldon|first=S.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=S.|date=2004-12-01|title=Should selecting saviour siblings be banned?|url=http://jme.bmj.com/content/30/6/533|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics|language=en|volume=30|issue=6|pages=533–537|doi=10.1136/jme.2003.004150|issn=1473-4257|pmc=1733988|pmid=15574438}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been arguments against the procedures of  “savior siblings” because many believe that this will lead humans closer to the creation of designer babies. For example, one critique said, “the new technique is a dangerous first step towards allowing parents to use embryo testing to choose other characteristics of the baby, such as eye colour and sex”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/2125482.stm|title=BBC NEWS {{!}} Health {{!}} Pro-life challenge to embryo testing|website=news.bbc.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Selective breeding|artificial selection]] of traits through the use of PGD has become a widely debated topic and governments have started to regulate this procedure.

Many countries completely prohibit PGD, including [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], and [[Switzerland]]. Other countries restrict PGD to medical use only, including [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Netherlands]], [[Italy]], [[Norway]], and the [[United Kingdom]].

In contrast, the United States federal law does not have any regulation of PGD. Those who are in favor of PGD believe the government should not be involved in the procedure and parents should have a reproductive choice. The opposing side has argued that PGD will allow embryo selection based on trivial traits. While other critics believe that this procedure could lead to a new form of [[Eugenics]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The regulation of PGD has become an important topic, however much of the artificial trait selection remains only prospective until technology advances. For example, scientist do not know which specific gene is associated with specific traits, like voice pitch or intelligence. Nevertheless, with the current rate of technological advancements, it is believed that in the next twenty years the artificial selection of desirable traits will exist.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Human germline engineering==

The other use for ''designer babies'' concerns possible uses of [[human germline engineering]] techniques (such as [[CRISPR]]) to create desired genetic traits of a child, such as disease resistance, athletic ability, and intelligence.&lt;ref name="Gordon1999"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordon JW |title=Genetic enhancement in humans |journal=Science |volume=283 |issue=5410 |pages=2023–4 |year=1999 |pmid=10206908 |doi=10.1126/science.283.5410.2023 |bibcode=1999Sci...283.2023G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Understanding of genetics for human traits===
{{Expand Section|date=December 2012}}
[[Genetics]] explains the process of parents passing down certain genes to their children. Genes are inherited from both biological parents, and each gene expresses a specific trait. The traits expressed by genes can be something physically seen—such as hair color, eye color, or height—or can be things such as diseases and disorders.&lt;ref name="What is Genetics"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Genetics.aspx|title=What is Genetics?|date=2009-12-11|newspaper=News-Medical.net|access-date=2016-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Human genes are found within chromosomes. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes, 46 individual chromosomes. 23 chromosomes are inherited from the father, and 23 from the mother. Each chromosome can carry about 20,000 genes.&lt;ref name="What is Genetics"/&gt;

Researchers have already connected the genes in the striped zebra fish which control the colour of the fish to genes in humans that determine skin colour.&lt;ref name="Green 2007" /&gt; Many other things could be discovered in further years especially with the new possibilities of cloning animals.

Scientists have been able to better understand the genetic traits of humans through projects such as The [[Human Genome Project]]. This project was launched around 1990 and was an international research project that had an end goal of mapping and understanding every gene in the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.genome.gov/12011238/an-overview-of-the-human-genome-project/|title=An Overview of the Human Genome Project - National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)|website=www.genome.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a part of the Human Genome Project, we have been able to pin point specific locations for about 12,800 specific genes within different chromosomes.&lt;ref name="What is Genetics"/&gt;

In recent times, the cost of gene sequencing has been radically reduced due to technological developments such as [[next generation sequencing]]. This enables the development of [[Biobank]]s that can store genetic information about a large number of people, enabling studies such as [[Genome-wide association study]] on genetic variants that cause common phenotypic traits in many people.

=== Germline modification ===
Germline modification has been around since the 1980s, as there have been successful animal trials dating back to that time.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=Kevin R.|last2=Chan|first2=Sarah|last3=Harris|first3=John|title=Human Germline Genetic Modification: Scientific and Bioethical Perspectives|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0188440912002445|journal=Archives of Medical Research|volume=43|issue=7|pages=491–513|doi=10.1016/j.arcmed.2012.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order for [[germline]] modification to be successful, medical professionals must know how to introduce a gene into the patient's’ cell and the germline so that it will be transferred subsequent generations and still maintain the proper functionality.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The way in which genes are integrated into the DNA is what determines that difference between germline modification and [[somatic cell]] modification.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lappé|first=Marc|date=1991-12-01|title=Ethical Issues in Manipulating the Human Germ Line|url=http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/6/621|journal=Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|language=en|volume=16|issue=6|pages=621–639|doi=10.1093/jmp/16.6.621|issn=0360-5310|pmid=1787391}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In order to be transferred to subsequent generations, these changes need to be carried out through the development of [[germ cell]]s.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4020-8852-0_12|title=Medical Enhancement and Posthumanity|last=Dresser|first=Rebecca|date=2008-01-01|publisher=Springer Netherlands|isbn=9781402088513|editor-last=Gordijn|editor-first=Bert|series=The International Library of Ethics, Law and Technology|pages=191–205|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-8852-0_12|editor-last2=Chadwick|editor-first2=Ruth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes in the germline result in permanent and heritable changes to the DNA.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  While amplification of positive effects would occur, there is also the risk that amplification of possible negative effects would also occur.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Since the results are generational, it is more complicated to study the long-term effects and therefore it is not a simple task to figure out if the benefits of germline modification outweigh the harm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Allowing families to have the ability to design their children and select for desirable traits is another major concern that germline modification presents.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Germline modification can be accomplished through different techniques that focus on modification of the [[epithelium|germinal epithelium]], [[germ cell]]s, or the [[fertilized egg]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Most of the techniques include transporting [[transgene]]s and then the transgenes are integrated with the DNA of the zygote.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  After integration, the transgene becomes a stable and functioning portion of the host’s genome.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  One technique involves a specific sequence of cloned DNA being inserted into the fertilized egg using the [[microinjection]] technique.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The sequence is inserted directly into the pronucleus.  The second technique uses the [[transfection]] process.  Stem cells obtained from the embryo during the [[blastocyst]]s stage are modified, combined with [[naked DNA]], and the resulting cell is reinserted into the embryo that is developing.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The third technique focuses on carrying DNA into the embryo by using [[retrovirus]]es.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

===Feasibility of gene therapy===
{{Main article|Gene therapy}}

Gene therapy is the use of DNA as a pharmaceutical agent to treat disease.  [[Gene therapy vector|Gene]] therapy was first conceptualized in 1972, with the authors urging caution before commencing gene therapy studies in humans.&lt;ref name="Friedman 1972"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors= |title=Gene therapy for human genetic disease? |journal=Science |volume=178 |issue=4061 |pages=648–9 |year=1972 |pmid=4343766 |doi=10.1126/science.178.4061.648 |bibcode=1972Sci...175..949F }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first FDA-approved gene therapy experiment in the [[United States]] occurred in 1990, on a four-year-old girl named, Ashanti DeSilva, she was treated for [[adenosine deaminase deficiency|ADA]]-[[severe combined immunodeficiency|SCID]].&lt;ref name="Gene Therapy Finds Its Niche"&gt;Sheridan, C. (2011). Gene therapy finds its niche. Nature Publishing Group, 29(2), 121–128. Nature Publishing Group. {{doi|10.1038/nbt.1769}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/genetics/sect4.htm|title=Gene Therapy|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a disease that had left her defenseless against infections spreading throughout her body. Dr. [[William French Anderson|W French Anderson]] was a major lead on this clinical trial, he worked for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://history.nih.gov/exhibits/genetics/sect4.htm|title=Gene Therapy - A Revolution in Progress: Human Genetics and Medical Research|website=history.nih.gov|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, over 1,700 clinical trials have been conducted using a number of techniques for gene therapy.&lt;ref name="JGenMed Database"&gt;''J. Gene Med.'' [http://www.wiley.com/legacy/wileychi/genmed/clinical/ Gene Therapy Clinical Trials Database].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Techniques in gene therapy ===
The techniques used in gene therapy, which are also referred to as vectors, have a method of using a healthy gene to attack and replace an infected gene. The number of techniques or vectors that have been used to conduct these clinical trials vary. A few of the techniques are basic processing, [[gene doping]], and [[viral vector]]s. Viral infections can be life-threatening in patients who are immune-compromised because they cannot mount an effective immune response. Approaches to protection from infection using gene therapy include T cell-based immunotherapy, stem-cell based therapy, genetic vaccines, and other approaches to genetic blockade of infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asgct.org/about_gene_therapy/diseases.php|title=Gene Therapy for Diseases {{!}} ASGCT - American Society of Gene &amp; Cell Therapy|website=www.asgct.org|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also other approaches known as T cell-based approaches, cell therapy, stem-cell-based approaches, and genetic vaccines.

Basic processing can be achieved through replacement of a mutated gene, inactivation of a mutated gene, or introduction of a new gene to help fight a disease caused by mutation. Secondly, gene doping is a procedure of gene therapy that modulates gene expression of a particular gene. This procedure is mainly used to improve athletic ability for sporting events. This is a genetic form of human enhancement that is able to treat muscle-wasting disorders. It is a highly controversial procedure because the results do nothing unusual to the bloodstream, so athletic officials would be unable to detect chemicals in a blood or urine test. An example of gene doping would be proving athlete with [[erythropoietin]] (EPO), a hormone that increases the red blood cell count. Lastly, viral vectors are able to mimic the methods of a normal virus in the human body to introduce favorable genes into a human cell. For instance, scientists are able to positively change the host's genome by removing the genes that cause disease from a virus and replacing it with genes of the desired trait (“Types of Gene Therapy”).

The aforementioned techniques have been used by scientists, but the most popularized techniques are [[naked DNA]] and DNA complexes. The injection of the naked DNA is the simplest form of the vector delivery method. The naked DNA is a histone-free, modified DNA sequence that removes proteins that would normally surround these structures. This form of delivery is sometimes used as a natural compound, but the United States has been making large waves of synthetic compounds for gene delivery. The other form, which is DNA complexes, has been used when a compound is crossed with a chemical mix in order to produce the desired compound. There are other studies that are currently underway that have been referred to as the hybrid method because there is a combination of two or more gene therapy techniques used. This can instill the idea that the desired gene will stick during the delivery, transfer, and implant.

The manipulation of an organism’s genome for a desirable trait is related to the medical procedure of [[cloning]]. The process of [[cloning]] results in making genetically identical organisms. Moreover, scientists can use gene therapy vectors to modify the DNA to be identical to a particular organism. Moreover, the techniques established by the field of gene therapy can potentially be used to create “designer babies”. This can be achieved through the use of IVF to assist in creating a genetically designed baby.

==== Disease control in gene therapy ====
Gene therapy is being studied for the treatment of a wide variety of acquired and inherited disorders.

Lee Silver has projected a [[dystopia]] in which a race of [[Übermensch|superior humans]] look down on those without genetic enhancements, though others have counseled against accepting this vision of the future.&lt;ref name="Silver 1998"&gt;{{cite book| author=Silver, Lee M.| title=Remaking Eden: Cloning and Beyond in a Brave New World| publisher=Harper Perennial| year=1998| isbn=0-380-79243-5| authorlink=Lee M.

There are risks associated with genetic modifications to any organism.  When focusing on the ethics behind this treatment, medical professionals and clinical ethicists take many factors into consideration.  They look at whether or not the goal and outcome of the treatment are supposed to impact an individual and their family lineage or a group of people.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The main ethical issue with pure germline modification is that these types of treatments will produce a change that can be passed down to future generations and therefore any error, known or unknown, will also be passed down and will affect the offspring.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=W. French|date=1985-08-01|title=Human Gene Therapy: Scientific and Ethical Considerations|url=http://jmp.oxfordjournals.org/content/10/3/275|journal=Journal of Medicine and Philosophy|language=en|volume=10|issue=3|pages=275–292|doi=10.1093/jmp/10.3.275|issn=0360-5310|pmid=3900264}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New diseases may be introduced accidentally.&lt;ref name = "Green 2007"&gt;{{cite book | last = Green | first = Ronald M. | title = Babies By Design: The Ethics of Genetic Choice | publisher = Yale University Press | year = 2007 | location = New Haven | pages = 96–97 | id = 129954761 | isbn = 978-0-300-12546-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agar2006"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agar|first=Nicholas|year=2006|title=Designer Babies: Ethical Considerations|url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biotechnology/agar.html|journal=ActionBioscience.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of germline modification is justified when it is used to correct genetic problems that cannot be treated with somatic cell therapy, stabilize DNA in a mating that has the potential to be high risk, provide an alternative to the abortion of embryos that genetically problematic for a family, and intensify the incidence of genes that are favorable and desirable.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This can ultimately lead to perfected lineages on a genotypic level and possibly a phenotypic level.  Ultimately, these issues raise potential questions about the welfare and identity of individuals that have been genetically modified through the germline.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Safety is a major concern when it comes to the gene editing and mitochondrial transfer. Since the effects of germline modification can be passed down to multiple generations, experimentation of this treatment brings forth many questions and concerns about the ethics of completing this research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  If a patient has undergone germline modification treatment, the coming generations, one or two after the initial treatment, will be used as trials to see if the changes in the germline have been successful.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  This extended waiting time could possess harmful implications since the effect of the treatment is not known until it has been passed down to a few generations.  Problems with the gene editing may not appear until after the child with edited genes is born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=January 2016|title=Designer babies|journal=Obstetrics, gynecology and reproductive medicine|volume=26|issue=2|pages=59–60|doi=10.1016/j.ogrm.2015.11.011|last1=Pang|first1=Ronald T.K}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the patient assumes the risk alone, consent may be given for the treatment, but it is less justified when it comes to giving consent for future generations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  On a larger scale, germline modification has the potential to impact the gene pool of the entire human race in a negative or positive way.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Germline modification is considered a more ethically and morally acceptable treatment when a patient is a carrier for a harmful trait and is treated to improve the genotype and safety of the future generations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  When the treatment is used for this purpose, it can fill the gaps that other technologies may not be able to accomplish.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Since experimentation of the germline occurs directly on embryos, there is a major ethical deliberation on experimenting with fertilized eggs and embryos and killing the flawed ones.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  The embryo cannot give consent and some of the treatments have long-lasting and harmful implications.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  In many countries, editing embryos and germline modification for reproductive use is illegal.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ishii|first=Tetsuya|title=Germline genome-editing research and its socioethical implications|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1471491415001070|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|volume=21|issue=8|pages=473–481|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2015.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2017, the United States of America restricts the use of germline modification and the procedure is under heavy regulation by the [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] and [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  The American [[National Academy of Sciences]] and [[National Academy of Medicine]] gave qualified support to human genome editing in 2017 once answers have been found to safety and efficiency problems "but only for serious conditions under stringent oversight."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/health/human-gene-editing-panel.html|title=Human Gene Editing Receives Science Panel’s Support|last=Harmon|first=Amy|date=2017-02-14|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-17|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germline modification would be more practical if sampling methods were less destructive and used the polar bodies rather than embryos.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Another risk involved with having a designer baby is the lack of regulation of egg freezing centers as shown by failures in egg clinics at the Pacific Fertility Clinic in San Francisco and at the Ahuja Medical Center in Beachwood Ohio.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Jane. “Egg Freezing Industry Reeling After Two Major Malfunctions.” NBC News, 12 Mar. 2018, www.nbcnews.com/health/womens-health/egg-freezing-industry-reeling-after-two-major-malfunctions-n856016. Accessed 25 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these centers lost hundreds of eggs after some of the tanks holding the eggs failed. Egg freezing centers are not required to report their failures to any government agency and don't have to tell the public unless a negative news report comes out about the incident. One of these facilities already knew that the tank that malfunctioned had issues long before, and the eggs were supposed to be transferred from the defective tank but they never were.

In 2018, the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]] issued a report which concluded that under certain circumstances, editing of the DNA of human embryos could be acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawkes|first=Nigel|date=2018-07-17|title=Human genome editing is not unethical, says Nuffield Council|url=https://www.bmj.com/content/362/bmj.k3140|journal=BMJ|language=en|volume=362|pages=k3140|doi=10.1136/bmj.k3140|issn=0959-8138|pmid=30018086}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Nuffield Council is a British independent organisation that evaluates ethical questions in medicine and biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5486">The '''effective number of parties''' is a concept introduced by Laakso and Taagepera (1979) which provides for an adjusted number of [[political parties]] in a country's [[party system]].  The idea behind this measure is to count parties and, at the same time, to [[Weight function|weight]] the count by their relative strength. The relative strength refers to their vote share ("effective number of electoral parties") or seat share in the parliament ("effective number of parliamentary parties"). This measure is especially useful when comparing [[electoral system]]s across countries, as is done in the field of [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;Lijphart, Arend (1999): Patterns of Democracy. New Haven/London: Yale UP&lt;/ref&gt; The number of parties equals the effective number of parties only when all parties have equal strength. In any other case, the effective number of parties is lower than the actual number of parties. The effective number of parties is a frequent operationalization &lt;!-- what does this word mean? --&gt; for the fragmentation of a party system.

[[File:Effective Number of Parliamentary Parties in the Netherlands (1981-2017).png|thumb|Example of how the Effective Number of Parties shows the fragmentation of the Dutch political landscape (1981-2017)]]

There are two major alternatives to the  effective number of parties-measure.&lt;ref name="Lijphart1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Arend Lijphart]] |title=Electoral Systems and Party Systems: A Study of Twenty-seven Democracies, 1945-1990 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hsz3ML3hgUUC&amp;pg=PA69 |date=1 January 1994 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-827347-9 |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt; John K. Wildgen's index of "hyperfractionalization" accords special weight to small parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cps.sagepub.com/content/4/2/233.extract |title=The Measurement of Hyperfractionalization |publisher=Cps.sagepub.com |date=1971-07-01 |accessdate=2014-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juan Molinar's index gives special weight to the largest party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1963951|title=Counting the Number of Parties: An Alternative Index|first=Juan|last=Molinar|date=1 January 1991|publisher=|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=85|issue=4|pages=1383–1391|doi=10.2307/1963951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunleavy and Boucek provide a useful critique of the Molinar index.&lt;ref&gt;P. Dunleavy and F. Boucek (2003): 'Constructing the Number of Parties.' Party Politics 9(3): 291-315.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulae==
According to [[Markku Laakso|Laakso]] and [[Rein Taagepera|Taagepera]] (1979)&lt;ref&gt;Laakso, M.; R. Taagepera (1979): Effective Number of Parties: A Measure with Application to West Europe. ''Comparative Political Studies'' 12:3-27.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''effective number of parties'' is computed by the following formula:
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N = \frac{1}{\sum_{i=1}^n p_i^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
Where n is the number of parties with at least one vote/seat and &lt;math&gt; p_i^2 &lt;/math&gt; the square of each party’s proportion of all votes or seats. The proportions need to be ''normalised'' such that, for example, 50 per cent is 0.5 and 1 per cent is 0.01. This is also the formula for the [[Simpson index|inverse Simpson index]], or the true diversity of order 2.

An alternative formula proposed by Golosov (2010)&lt;ref&gt;Golosov, Grigorii V. (2010): The Effective Number of Parties: A New Approach. ''Party Politics'' 16:171-192.&lt;/ref&gt; is
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{p_i}{p_i+p_1^2-p_i^2} &lt;/math&gt;
|}
which is equivalent - if we only consider parties with at least one vote/seat - to
{|
|-
| &lt;math&gt;N = \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{1}{1+(p_1^2/p_i)-p_i} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Here, n is the number of parties, &lt;math&gt; p_i^2 &lt;/math&gt; the square of each party’s proportion of all votes or seats, and &lt;math&gt; p_1^2 &lt;/math&gt; is the square of the largest party’s proportion of all votes or seats.

==Values==
The following table illustrates the difference between the values produced by the two formulas for eight hypothetical vote or seat constellations:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Constellation !! Largest component, fractional share !! Other components, fractional shares !! N, Laakso-Taagepera !! N, Golosov
|-
| A || 0.75 || 0.25 || 1.60 || 1.33
|-

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4448">In [[philosophy]] and [[rhetoric]], '''eristic''' (from ''[[Eris (mythology)|Eris]]'', the ancient Greek [[goddess]] of chaos, strife, and discord) refers to [[argument]] that aims to successfully dispute another's argument, rather than searching for [[truth]]. According to T.H. Irwin, "It is characteristic of the eristic to think of some arguments as a way of defeating the other side, by showing that an opponent must assent to the negation of what he initially took himself to believe."&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, T.H. "Plato's Objection to the Sophists." The Greek World. London: Routledge, 1995. P. 585. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Eristic is arguing for the sake of conflict, as opposed to resolving conflict.&lt;ref&gt;H.D. Rankin (1983). Sophists, Socratics and Cynics. Pp. 233–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in education==
Eristic was a type of "question-and-answer"&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Nehamas. "Eristic, Antilogic, Sophistic, Dialectic: Plato's Demarcation of Philosophy from Sophistry". (page 6)&lt;/ref&gt; teaching method popularized by the [[Sophism|Sophists]], such as [[Euthydemus (Socratic literature)|Euthydemos]] and [[Dionysodoros]]. Students learned eristic arguments to "refute their opponent, no matter whether he [said] yes or no in answer to their initial question".&lt;ref&gt;Irwin, T.H. "Plato's Objection to the Sophists." The Greek World. London: Routledge, 1995. 583. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Plato]] contrasted this type of argument with [[dialectic]] and other more [[reason]]able and [[logic]]al methods (e.g., at [[The Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']] 454a). In the dialogue [[Euthydemus (dialogue)|''Euthydemus'']], Plato satirizes eristic. It is more than persuasion, and it is more than discourse. It is a combination that wins an argument without regard to truth. Plato believed that the eristic style "did not constitute a method of argument" because to argue eristically is to consciously use fallacious arguments, which therefore weakens one's position.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Nehamas. "Eristic, Antilogic, Sophistic, Dialectic: Plato's Demarcation of Philosophy from Sophistry". (page 7).&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike Plato, [[Isocrates]] (often considered a Sophist) did not distinguish eristic from dialectic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0168:book=5:section=454a&lt;/ref&gt; He held that both lacked a "'useful application' ... that created responsible citizens",&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, Charles. Classical rhetoric and modern public relations: an Isocratean model. New York: Routledge, 2013. P. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; which unscrupulous teachers used for "enriching themselves at the expense of the youth."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0144:speech=15:section=45&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical eristic==
[[Schopenhauer]] considers that only logic pursues truth. For him, [[dialectic]], [[sophistry]] and eristic have no objective truth in view, but only the appearance of it, and pay no regard to truth itself because it aims at victory. He names these three last methods as "eristic dialectic (contentious argument)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://coolhaus.de/art-of-controversy/eristii.htm Controversial Dialectic] on CoolHaus.de accessed at January 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Schopenhauer]], [[The Art of Being Right|''Eristic Dialectic'']] is mainly concerned to tabulate and analyze dishonest stratagems,&lt;ref&gt;In his ''Dialectica Eristica'' Schopenhauer presents 38 eristic stratagems&lt;/ref&gt; so that they may at once be recognized and defeated, in order to continue with a productive dialectic debate. It is for this very reason that Eristic Dialectic must admittedly take victory, and not objective truth, for its selfish aim and purpose.

==Argumentation theory==
[[Argumentation theory]] is a field of study that asks critical questions about eristic arguments and the other types of dialogue.

Models of food-sharing are based upon general [[evolutionary theory]]. When applied to human behavior, these models are considered a branch of [[human behavioral ecology]]. Several types of food-sharing models have been developed, including [[kin selection]], [[reciprocal altruism]], tolerated theft, group cooperation, and costly signaling. Kin selection and reciprocal altruism models of food-sharing are based upon evolutionary concepts of kin selection and [[Altruism (biology)|altruism]]. Since the theoretical basis of these models is formulated around [[reproductive fitness]], one underlying assumption of these models is that greater resource accumulation increases reproductive fitness. Food-sharing has been theorized as an important development in early human evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Isaac |first=Glynn |title=The Food-sharing Behavior of Protohuman Hominids |url=http://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1038/scientificamerican0478-90 |journal=Scientific American |volume=238 |issue=4 |pages=90–108 |doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0478-90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=1978-10-01 |title=The Harvey Lecture Series, 1977-1978.

==Kin selection models==

[[W. D. Hamilton]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hamilton |first=W. D. |authorlink=W. D. Hamilton |date=1964 |title=The genetical evolution of social behavior |url= |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=7 |pages=1:52}}&lt;/ref&gt; was among the first to propose an explanation for [[natural selection]] of altruistic behaviors among related individuals. According to his model, natural selection will favor altruistic behavior towards kin when the benefit (as a contributing factor to reproductive fitness) towards the recipient (scaled based upon Wright's [[coefficient of genetic relatedness]] between donor and recipient) outweighs the cost of giving. In other words, [[kin selection]] implies that food will be given when there is a great benefit to the recipient with low cost to the donor. An example of this would be sharing food among kin during a period of surplus. The implications of kin-selection is that natural selection will also favor the development of ways of determining kin from non-kin and close kin from distant kin. When [[Hamilton's rule]] is applied to food-sharing behavior, a simple expectation of the model is that close kin should receive food shares either more frequently or in larger quantities than distant relatives and non-kin.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Feinman |first=Saul |date=2016-12-07 |title=An evolutionary theory of food sharing |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/053901847901800404 |journal=Social Science Information |volume=18 |issue=4–5 |pages=695–726 |doi=10.1177/053901847901800404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, greater imbalances in the quantities shared between close kin are expected than those shared with non-kin or distantly related individuals&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hames |first=Raymond |title=Garden labor exchange among the Ye'kwana |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0162309587900288 |journal=Ethology and Sociobiology |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=259–284 |doi=10.1016/0162-3095(87)90028-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, if reciprocal altruism is an important factor, then this may not be the case among close kin who are also reciprocity partners&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Gurven |first=Michael |last2=Hill |first2=Kim |last3=Kaplan |first3=Hillard |last4=Hurtado |first4=Ana |last5=Lyles |first5=Richard |date=2000-06-01 |title=Food Transfers Among Hiwi Foragers of Venezuela: Tests of Reciprocity |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1007067919982 |journal=Human Ecology |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=171–218 |doi=10.1023/A:1007067919982}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see subsection below). Based on Feinman's&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; extension of Hamilton's model, cheating such as recipients not sharing food with their donors, is more likely to take place between unrelated (or distantly related) individuals than closely related individuals.

==Reciprocal models==

In addition to expanding the ideas of Hamilton and kin-based altruism, Saul Feinman&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; also theorized food-sharing based on [[Robert Trivers]]'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Trivers |first=Robert L. |authorlink=Robert Trivers |date=1971-03-01 |title=The Evolution of Reciprocal Altruism |url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/406755 |journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology |volume=46 |issue=1 |pages=35–57 |doi=10.1086/406755}}&lt;/ref&gt; model of [[reciprocal altruism]]. Following Trivers' ideas, reciprocal altruism models of food-sharing generate expectations of when and how a recipient of food from a donor will share food in a future interaction with that donor.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=Hillard |last2=Hill |first2=Kim |last3=Cadeliña |first3=Rowe V. |last4=Hayden |first4=Brian |last5=Hyndman |first5=David Charles |last6=Preston |first6=Richard J. |last7=Smith |first7=Eric Alden |last8=Stuart |first8=David E. |last9=Yesner |first9=David R. |date=1985-01-01 |title=Food Sharing Among Ache Foragers: Tests of Explanatory Hypotheses [and Comments and Reply] |jstor=2743137 |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=223–246}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Winterhalder |first=Bruce |title=Diet choice, risk, and food sharing in a stochastic environment |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/0278-4165(86)90017-6 |journal=Journal of Anthropological Archaeology |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=369–392 |doi=10.1016/0278-4165(86)90017-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the kin selection model, food will be shared when the benefit towards the recipient is greater than the costs to the donor, such as a period of surplus.

[[File:Chimpanzees-Share-Forbidden-Fruit-pone.0000886.s002.ogv|thumb|Food sharing in [[chimpanzee]]s]]

In 1984, Jim Moore&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Moore |first=Jim |title=The evolution of reciprocal sharing |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0162309584900311 |journal=Ethology and Sociobiology | year=1984 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=5–14 |doi=10.1016/0162-3095(84)90031-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; proposed a model for the evolution of reciprocal food-sharing based on evidence from [[chimpanzee]]s and modern human [[hunter-gatherer]] groups. This model was designed to address problems that Trivers' model failed to address. One problem, according to Moore, was that the model did not adequately explain the initial development of reciprocal altruism. If a population started with one reciprocal altruist who only gives benefits to other reciprocal altruists, then this trait would not be selected as there would be no other altruists to interact with.

Moore's model made the following assumptions:

* Humans evolved from chimp-like ancestors with a similar hierarchical social structure (i.e., open dominance hierarchy that is male-dominated)
* Males were highly motivated to achieve high rank. The short term reward of this was the position itself and the long-term reward was reproductive success, which resulted from greater access to mates with high rank position.
* Begging behavior similar to that of [[chimpanzee]]s existed, such as that between an infant and mother
* There is an intermediate range of resource abundance that will favor sharing (e.g., meat for human ancestors that were occasionally-carnivorous herbivores)

With these assumptions, Moore proposed that human ancestors would have learned to hunt and share food if they faced punitive action from other group members if an individual did not share food with the group. An individual who finds a scarce, defensible resource would have faced begging behavior from other group members. Costs and benefits of sharing in this scenario can be sorted into status, fight risk, and nutritional value. Nutritional value is determined by the size of the food portion relative to the nutritional needs of the individuals. The nutritional value remains constant throughout this scenario, or declines in value as portions of it are consumed by the obtaining individual. As another individual begs with increasing intensity, the beggar's social cost increases, until the beggar's social costs exceed that of fighting; this is paralleled by the benefits to the food-obtainer. If the benefits to the food-obtainer exceed the beggar's cost of fighting, then the beggar should attack. At or before this time, the food-obtainer should decide to share or not. This decision is made depending on the expected reaction from the beggar. It is expected that they will decide to share at a time that would maximize benefits and minimize loss in nutritional value. If the beggar was initially dominant, it may follow up the first sharing interaction with further begging or fighting, reciprocation of sharing, or let the incident pass. Further begging and fighting impose risk onto the beggar as the food-obtainer might feel and behave dominantly and become dominant if the beggar loses. Inaction allows the food-obtainer to remain slightly dominant. If other group members witnessed this change in dominance position, then the beggar may demonstrate [[redirected aggression]] and attack a lower-rank bystander. Later, when the beggar obtains food, it may chose to reciprocate after getting the initial food-obtainer to beg, but this only occurs if the benefits offered exceed the status cost of the initial food-obtainer's begging. Thus, Moore's model predicted that natural selection would favor aggressive sharing and assertive reciprocation to re-establish status.

Feinman attempted to combine kin selection and reciprocal food-sharing models.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Based on inequalities in direct access to food resources among hunter-gatherers, donors are more likely to share foods that their recipients do not have direct access to.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Feinman also hypothesizes that, as a donor's reproductive value decreases, the probability of the donor giving food increases, either with or without reciprocal sharing. For example, older individuals (mostly women) in some foraging societies will share food and care of younger unrelated individuals. Further, the probability of a donor giving food will decrease as the reproductive value of a recipient also decreases. Some foods are not as predictable in their distribution and are thus termed less reliable.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As foods become less reliable, they are expected to be shared more because they are rarer than more commonly encountered food sources. As food becomes scarcer, donors are expected to become more strict in their sharing habits and may favor close relatives, recipients who actively reciprocate and give food, and recipients with higher reproductive value (such as younger offspring or prospective mates) over others. Donors will also tend to share with those who remain familiar and in close proximity to them. Feinman also hypothesizes that donors are more likely to share with those who are culturally similar to them over those who are culturally different.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recent studies of chimpanzees and other nonhuman primates have found evidence to support reciprocal sharing; however, other factors such as grooming and begging behaviors may also contribute to patterns of nonhuman primate food sharing.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jaeggi |first=Adrian V. |last2=Stevens |first2=Jeroen M.G. |last3=Van Schaik |first3=Carel P. |date=2010-09-01 |title=Tolerant food sharing and reciprocity is precluded by despotism among bonobos but not chimpanzees |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ajpa.21288/abstract |journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology |volume=143 |issue=1 |pages=41–51 |doi=10.1002/ajpa.21288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jaeggi |first=Adrian V. |last2=Groot |first2=Evelien De |last3=Stevens |first3=Jeroen M.

==Tolerated theft==

Models of tolerated theft seek to explain why in some hunter-gatherer societies, scrounging behaviour is tolerated by other members of a group.&lt;ref name=BlurtonJones1987&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Blurton Jones |first=Nicholas G. |date=1987-03-01 |title=Tolerated theft, suggestions about the ecology and evolution of sharing, hoarding and scrounging |url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/053901887026001002 |journal=Information (International Social Science Council) |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=31–54 |doi=10.1177/053901887026001002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This developed in response to variance-reduction models, as reciprocal behavior might have socially related taboos tied to it (such as rules preventing a person to accumulate more wealth). Variance-reduction models seek to explain why redistribution of large food packages (caches or prey items) occurs in daily practices of hunter-gatherers. According to variance reduction theory, it is more optimal to do so than to let excess food rot or spoil.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Blurton Jones argued from an evolutionary biology perspective that, if these taboos did not exist, then it would be more beneficial to be selfish if one found food and did not share and also accepted shares from others (essentially, a cheater under altruism models). Under this idea, selfishness would be expected to develop as a dominant behavior. Unlike cooperative models that link sharing to hunting, tolerated theft links sharing to arrival of any food package (either hunted or scavenged). Cooperative and reciprocal models, according to Jones, could not explain how food-sharing initially developed in societies. He claimed tolerated theft did, then once it became frequent, reciprocal altruism could develop.&lt;ref name=BlurtonJones1987/&gt;

Jones outlines several assumptions for his model of tolerated theft:&lt;ref name=BlurtonJones1987/&gt;

* Food can be taken by force, unlike rescue or other reciprocal behaviors
* Food can be broken apart into portions, like parts of a single carcass
* Individuals fight only for fitness gain. In this case, a resource’s fitness benefit determines the fight outcome. Individuals with much to gain will fight harder and usually win, gaining the fitness benefit.
* Resource values are unequal, but individuals have equal [[resource holding potential]] (RHP), a measurement of strength and fighting ability. 
* Some parts of a food package will have higher value than others (i.e., they follow a [[Diminishing returns|diminishing]] value curve).

Therefore, the individual that obtains a large package of food (in cases where this seldom happens) faces asymmetric contests over food, and the obtainer does not benefit from fighting over less valuable portions. However, latecomers who have not obtained food on their own will have much to gain even from the less valuable portions. It is not worth the effort for a food-obtainer to fight over these portions, and so the obtainer should be expected to relinquish these without a fight since it would likely lose to the latecomer. Thus, another expectation is that natural selection will favor the ability to assess costs and benefits. Among frequently interacting individuals, the roles of obtainer and latecomer/thief are interchanged, balancing out benefits of latecomer gains and obtainer losses, so reciprocation develops to avoid injury. Equal, reciprocal sharing is the eventual consequence from this tolerated theft behavior. When food packages are small to begin with, then theft is less tolerated as portions have lower returns along the assumed diminishing value curve. Hoarding is expected in cases where either food can be defended, there is a season of scarcity, a synchronous glut (ex. salmon run or agricultural harvest), or when accumulated food no longer follows a diminishing curve (as with financial capital). Scrounging is expected to increase among groups when active foragers miss out on sharing opportunities due to their own acts of less successful foraging. Foragers do worse than scroungers because scroungers are able to participate in 100% of sharing events.

Based on studies by de Waal and others,&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; chimpanzees exhibit tolerated theft behaviors. These are typically between mother and offspring and involve commonly available plant foods.

== Costly signaling models ==

[[Costly signaling theory|Costly signaling]] has been interpreted from ethnographic studies in regards to food sharing to explain why certain individuals (primarily men) tend to target difficult-to-acquire foods that sometimes produce less optimal yields. One explanation for this behavior is as a means for men to signal their reproductive quality to prospective mates.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hawkes |first=Kristen |last2=Bliege Bird |first2=Rebecca |date=2002-01-01 |title=Showing off, handicap signaling, and the evolution of men's work |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/evan.20005/abstract |journal=Evolutionary Anthropology: Issues, News, and Reviews |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=58–67 |doi=10.1002/evan.20005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Eric Alden |date=2004-12-01 |title=Why do good hunters have higher reproductive success? |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-004-1013-9 |journal=Human Nature |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=343–364 |doi=10.1007/s12110-004-1013-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Hawkes |first=K. |last2=O'connell |first2=J.

In their study of turtle hunting by the [[Meriam people]] (one of the indigenous [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples), Smith and Bliege Bird&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Smith |first=Eric Alden |last2=Bird |first2=Rebecca L. Bliege |date=2000-07-01 |title=Turtle hunting and tombstone opening |url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(00)00031-3/fulltext |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=245–261 |doi=10.1016/S1090-5138(00)00031-3 |pmid=10899477}}&lt;/ref&gt; frame this collective food-sharing behavior within a costly signaling framework. Among the Meriam, a family will sponsor a turtle-hunting group to collect turtles for feasting purposes associated with funerary activities. Since the hunting group does not receive any of the turtles in return, this behavior does not fit within a reciprocal or cooperative food-sharing framework. Instead, the benefits to hunters is through the signals from hunting. The leaders of these hunting groups signal their skills, specialized knowledge, and charisma which allow them to gain widespread social status when they are successful. This benefit allows hunters to gain priority in other social considerations such as marriages and alliances. The family who sponsored these hunting groups receives all of the captured turtles with no expectation of reciprocal payment in the future. The costs to the hunters are through provisioning the hunt itself, including the purchase of fuel for the boats.

Another consideration of group cooperation is as a way to increase food yields in comparison to acquiring food individually; this can be considered a form of [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]]. Bruce Winterhalder&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; incorporates food-sharing among groups into the diet breadth model derived from [[optimal foraging theory]] as a means to reduce risk. Risk is measured in this model as a measure of the probability that a forager's net acquisition rate (NAR) falls below a minimum value, such as a threshold for starvation. Through the use of a [[Stochastic calculus|stochastic model]], a group of independent foragers are able to meet and pool their resources at the end of a foraging period and divide the total resources equally among the group. Through a series of simulations exploring values of group size and other parameters of the model, the results suggest that risk is effectively reduced by pooling and dividing equal shares of resources. When compared with changes in diet breadth, sharing seems to be better at reducing risk than changing the diet breadth. Examination of various group sizes suggests that small groups are capable of effectively reducing risk.

The '''GenI process'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1011107944|title=The Source of the Universe|last=Genreith|first=Siegfried|publisher=Books on Demand|others=|year=2017|isbn=9783848223572|location=Norderstedt|pages=44|oclc=}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|dʒ|iː|n|aɪ}} for Generic Intelligence) models team decision making by launching a chaotic competition between so-called ideas, where one idea after another dwindles out until exactly one remains. The decision statistics are completely determined by the process start configuration and match those known from [[Measurement in quantum mechanics|quantum measurements]]. The random process accomplishes this in a natural way without any fine adjustment. Therefore, it is also of interest for the interpretation of physical processes.

In mathematical terms, the GenI process describes a time-discrete [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;X: [0,1] \times \mathbb{N}_0 \rightarrow 2^E&lt;/math&gt; in the state space of the [[Set (mathematics)|finite subsets]] of a [[countable set]] ''E'', together with a mapping &lt;math&gt;2^E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;  of the [[power set]] on ''E'' into an [[Vector space|n-dimensional complex vector space]]. In principle, it can be classified as a [[Markov chain]] of first order, with variable [[Markov chain|transition probabilities]] &lt;math&gt;P(X_{n+1} \mid X_n)&lt;/math&gt;.

There are two expressions of the GenI process, for &lt;math&gt;n \geq 2&lt;/math&gt; and for &lt;math&gt;n=2&lt;/math&gt;.

== GenI process on eigenvector swarms ==

=== Background ===
The GenI [[Stochastic process|random process]] determines changes in the complex vector space from the random behavior of independent individuals within a [[Swarm behaviour|swarm]]-like construct. The swarm has a [[Quantum superposition|superposition]] state &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j e_j \in \mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt;, that controls the individual activities via a target function. The [[Amplitude|amplitudes]] &lt;math&gt;\beta_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; are also called ideas (cf "Generalized Quantum Modeling" &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabora|first=Liane|last2=Kitto|first2=Kirsty|date=2017|title=Toward a Quantum Theory of Humor|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fphy.2016.00053/full|journal=Frontiers in Physics|language=English|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fphy.2016.00053|issn=2296-424X}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The swarm takes one of the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenstates]] &lt;math&gt;\gamma e_j&lt;/math&gt;  after a finite number of steps, with the well-defined [[probability]] &lt;math&gt;\frac {\vert{\beta_j}\vert^2} {\sum_k {\vert \beta_k \vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The individuals follow defined rules and are allowed to make mistakes, based on the processes in simulated shoals of fish&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=COUZIN|first=IAIN D.|last2=KRAUSE|first2=JENS|last3=JAMES|first3=RICHARD|last4=RUXTON|first4=GRAEME D.|last5=FRANKS|first5=NIGEL R.|authorlink5=Nigel R.

The GenI [[algorithm]] starts a [[Chaotics|chaotic]] [[decision-making]] process as a [[competition]] of ideas, such as running in a team that has to choose from a limited number of solutions to a given task. In the course of the process, a selection mechanism leads to ideas becoming extinct one after the other until finally just one survives that represents the solution to the problem.

Let ''E'' be a countable set and &lt;math&gt;\tilde E := \{ S \subset E : \vert S \vert &lt; \infty \} \subset 2^E&lt;/math&gt; the set of finite subsets of ''E''. Next &lt;math&gt;B = (e_1, \ldots, e_n)&lt;/math&gt; the [[canonical basis]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde B :=
\{i^k e_j : k = 0 \ldots 3, j = 1 \ldots n \}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''i'' is the [[imaginary unit]] in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;.

A given &lt;math&gt;\rho : E  \rightarrow \tilde B&lt;/math&gt; maps each element of ''E'' into &lt;math&gt;\tilde B&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\forall e \in \tilde B : \vert \rho^{-1} (\{e\}) \vert = \infty&lt;/math&gt;. For a set &lt;math&gt;S \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt;  the complex vector &lt;math&gt;\rho(S) := \sum_{s \in S} \rho(s)
= \sum_j \beta_j e_j&lt;/math&gt; denotes its state with complex '''amplitudes''' &lt;math&gt;\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;. Each such set ''S'' is called an Eigenvector-swarm or '''E-swarm'''.

A [[Ordered pair|pair]] &lt;math&gt;s, t \in E&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\rho(s) + \rho(t) = 0&lt;/math&gt; is a '''null pair'''. A [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(s_0, s_1, s_2, s_3)&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null ring''' generated by &lt;math&gt;s_0&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;\exists j : \rho(s_k) = i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt;.

A set &lt;math&gt;N \in \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; is called a '''null set''', if &lt;math&gt;\rho(N) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. A maximal null set &lt;math&gt;N \subset S&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''entropy''' of ''S'' and &lt;math&gt;S \setminus N&lt;/math&gt; the '''entropy free residual swarm'''.

The term &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_j (S) := 2 \frac {\vert \beta_j \vert \sqrt{\sum_{k \neq j} \vert \beta_k \vert^2}}
{\sum_{k=1}^n \vert \beta_k\vert^2} \in [0; 1]&lt;/math&gt; denotes the '''excitation''' of the swarm in index ''j''.

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(l)} = S_D^{(l)} + N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; be a series of swarms (as an instantiation of &lt;math&gt;X(\omega, l)&lt;/math&gt;) with the respective separation into a maximal null swarm &lt;math&gt;N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; and the entropy free residual swarm &lt;math&gt;S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho(S^{(l)}) =\sum_{k=1}^{n} \beta_k^{(l)} e_k&lt;/math&gt; the respective state and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon_j^{(l)} := \varepsilon_j(S^{(l)})&lt;/math&gt; the excitations.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and start with a given swarm &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': If &lt;math&gt;\forall j : \varepsilon_j^{(l)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then finish the process. 
# '''Step''': Each element &lt;math&gt;s  \in S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; generates an additional null ring within the swarm.
# '''Step''': Each null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; (including the newly generated) with &lt;math&gt;\rho( r)= i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho( t)= - i^k e_j&lt;/math&gt; gets selected with probability &lt;math&gt;p= \varepsilon_j^{(l) 2}&lt;/math&gt; (and "burned" in the next step). 
# '''Step''': For each selected null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, ''t'' leaves the swarm with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{r\})} {\varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{r\}) + \varepsilon_j(S \setminus \{t\})}&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise ''t'' stays and ''r'' leaves the swarm.
# '''Step''': The resulting swarm is &lt;math&gt;S^{(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow l+1&lt;/math&gt; and start over with step 2.

==== Interpretation ====
[[File:Competition_of_ideas_within_an_GenI_swarm.jpg|alt=Competition of ideas within an GenI swarm|thumb|Competition of ideas within an GenI swarm: Graph a shows the evolution of absolute amplitudes during a GenI process operating in a four options environment. Due to its intrinsically chaotic behavior, it is impossible to predict the GenI process evolution at any point. The option with the lowest initial chance finally wins.
Chart b shows the according evolution of entropy rising dramatically at the end for the winning idea. Figure c displays the native paths of each idea in the complex plane.

]]
As soon as the excitation disappears in each index, the process naturally comes to rest in step 4 (except for the hard abort condition in step 2), since no null pair is "burned" and the state of the swarm no longer changes. The role of the excitation here reminds of the dynamics of a grain of sand in the formation of the [[Ernst Chladni|Chladnic sound figures]]. On the other hand, excitation as a target in step 5 leads to a systematic distortion from 50% likelihood for an individual to remain. This leads here to an improved tendency to reduce the excitation. The following interpretation is obvious based on biological swarm behavior&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;: Each individual tends to follow the rule "reduce the excitation". It remains free in its decision to do nothing (step 4), to follow the rule, or to disregard it (step 5).

These results support the '''statement of convergence (hypothesis)''':

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)} = S&lt;/math&gt; be a given E-swarm with &lt;math&gt;\rho(S) = \sum_{j=1}^n \beta_j a_j&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;n \ge 2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_j =
\vert \beta_j \vert&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\vert S \vert = \sqrt{\sum b_j^2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;S : \mathbb{N}_0 \times [0; 1] \rightarrow \tilde E&lt;/math&gt; be a GenI process with  &lt;math&gt;\rho ( S^{(m)}(\omega))=\sum \beta_j^{(m)}(\omega) a_j&lt;/math&gt;.

Then &lt;math&gt;P \left(\tilde S^{(m)} \underset{m \rightarrow \infty}\longrightarrow \gamma a_j
\right) =P \left(\sum_{k \ne j} b_k^{(m) 2} \underset{m \rightarrow
\infty}\longrightarrow 0 \right) = \frac{b_j^2}{\vert {S} \vert^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

== GenI process on Pauli swarms ==
The P(auli) process represents a special version of the GenI process for binary YES-NO decisions. It determines a time discrete [[stochastic process]] &lt;math&gt;X: [0;1] \times \mathbb{N}_0 \mapsto 2^E&lt;/math&gt; in the state space of finite subsets of a countable set E, together with a map &lt;math&gt;\rho : 2^E \rightarrow \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; from the power set on E into the [[Complex number|complex]] [[Matrix ring|matrix algebra]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt;, a perspective vector &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt; and a basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Background ===
[[File:Competition within a GenI-swarm.jpg|alt=Competition within a GenI-swarm|thumb|Competition within a GenI-swarm: The diagrams a-c demonstrate the Pauli process (as a special expression of the GenI process) evolution using a fixed perspective p = (1;1) under an external environment defined by the observable p3.
Diagrams d-f show another test case under the internal environment defined by the swarm itself. Graphs a/d show the evolution of absolute amplitudes. Charts b/e show the according evolution of entropy for each type according to the swarm member images in {p0, ... , p3}. Null pairs for P-swarm do not relate to environment options as is true for E-swarms. Figures c/f display the native paths of each idea in the complex plane.]]
The GenI random process determines changes in the complex vector space out of the random behavior of independent individuals within a swarm-like construct. The swarm ''S'' has an image &lt;math&gt; \rho(S) \in  \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; in the complex matrix algebra. Together with a perspective &lt;math&gt;v \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;, the state of the swarm is determined by &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \rho(S) v&lt;/math&gt;. A basis &lt;math&gt;a_1, a_2 \in \mathbb{C}^2&lt;/math&gt;  is called the environment and represents the options under which the swarm makes a decision. This can also be the [[Eigenvalues and eigenvectors|eigenvectors]] of &lt;math&gt; \rho(S) \in  \mathbb{C}^{2 \times 2}&lt;/math&gt; itself and so create a [[self-reference]]. The environment, perspective and state of the swarm control the individual activities via a target variable (excitation). The amplitudes &lt;math&gt;\beta_j a_j&lt;/math&gt; in the decomposition are also referred to as ideas with respect to the environment (see regarding "Generalized Quantum Modeling" &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;). The swarm takes one of the eigenstates &lt;math&gt;\gamma a_j&lt;/math&gt;  after a finite number of steps, with the well-defined probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\vert{\beta_j}\vert^2}  {{\vert \beta_1 \vert}^2 + {\vert \beta_2 \vert}^2}&lt;/math&gt;. The individuals follow defined rules and are allowed to make mistakes, based on the processes in simulated shoals of fish&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The GenI algorithm starts a chaotic decision-making process as a competition of ideas, such as running in a team that has two possible solutions to a given task. In the course of the process, a selection mechanism leads to the survival of only one of the two ideas that represents the solution to the problem. The model in principal allows a moving environment.

The special properties of the P-process also allow interpretations of physical processes (see in particular [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]]'s ur-alternatives (archetypal objects) &lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Weizsäcker, Carl Friedrich, Freiherr von, 1912–2007.|Title=Aufbau der Physik|Publisher=C.

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(l)} = S_D^{(l)} + N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; be a series of swarms (as an instance von &lt;math&gt;X(\omega, l)&lt;/math&gt;) with the respective separation in a maximal null swarm &lt;math&gt;N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; and the entropy freed residual swarm &lt;math&gt;S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\tilde S^{(l)} =\beta_1^{(l)} a_1 + \beta_2^{(l)} a_2&lt;/math&gt; the respective states and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon^{(l)} := \varepsilon(S^{(l)})&lt;/math&gt; the excitations.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow 0&lt;/math&gt; and start with a given swarm &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': If &lt;math&gt; \varepsilon^{(l)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;, then finish the process.
# '''Step''': Each element &lt;math&gt;s  \in S_D^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; generates an additional null ring within the swarm.
# '''Step''': Each null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt; (including the newly generated) gets selected with probability &lt;math&gt;p= \varepsilon^{(l) 2}&lt;/math&gt; (and gets "burned" in next step).
# '''Step''': For each selected null pair &lt;math&gt;r,t \in N_S^{(l)}&lt;/math&gt;, ''t'' leaves the swarm with probability &lt;math&gt;\frac {\varepsilon(S \setminus \{r\})} {\varepsilon(S \setminus \{r\}) + \varepsilon(S \setminus \{t\})}&lt;/math&gt;. Otherwise ''t'' stays and ''r'' leaves the swarm.
# '''Step''': The resulting swarm is &lt;math&gt;S^{(l+1)}&lt;/math&gt;.
# '''Step''': Set &lt;math&gt;l \leftarrow l+1&lt;/math&gt; and start over with step 2.

The results support the '''statement of convergence (hypothesis)''':

Let &lt;math&gt;S^{(0)} = S&lt;/math&gt; be a given P-swarm with &lt;math&gt;\tilde S = \beta_1 a_1 + \beta_2 a_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b_j =

'''Giorgio Vasari''' ({{IPA-it|ˈdʒordʒo vaˈzaːri|lang}}; 30 July 1511 – 27 June 1574) was an [[Italians|Italian]] [[List of Italian painters|painter]], [[Architecture of Italy|architect]], writer, and historian, most famous today for his ''[[Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]'', considered the ideological foundation of [[art history|art-historical]] writing.

==Early life==
Vasari was born on 30 July 1511 in [[Arezzo]], [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref name=gaunt&gt;Gaunt, W. (ed.) (1962) ''Everyman's dictionary of pictorial art. Volume II.'' London: Dent, p. 328. {{ISBN|0-460-03006-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recommended at an early age by his cousin [[Luca Signorelli]], he became a pupil of [[Guglielmo da Marsiglia]], a skillful painter of [[stained glass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.travelingintuscany.com/art/giorgiovasari.htm|title=Art in Tuscany {{!}} Giorgio Vasari and Italian Renaissance painting {{!}} Podere Santa Pia, Holiday house in the south of Tuscany|website=www.travelingintuscany.com|access-date=2017-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sent to [[Florence]] at the age of sixteen by Cardinal Silvio Passerini, he joined the circle of [[Andrea del Sarto]] and his pupils [[Rosso Fiorentino]] and [[Jacopo Pontormo]], where his humanist education was encouraged. He was befriended by [[Michelangelo]], whose painting style would influence his own. He died on 27 June 1574 in [[Florence]], [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]], at aged 62.&lt;ref name=gaunt/&gt;

==Painting==

[[File:Giorgio Vasari - The Garden of Gethsemane - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Giorgio Vasari, ''The Garden of Gethsemane'']]  
In 1529, he visited [[Rome]] where he studied the works of [[Raphael]] and other artists of the Roman [[High Renaissance]]. Vasari's own [[Mannerist]] paintings were more admired in his lifetime than afterwards. In 1547 he completed the hall of the chancery in Palazzo della Cancelleria in Rome with frescoes that received the name [[Sala dei Cento Giorni]]. He was consistently employed by members of the [[Medici family]] in [[Florence]] and Rome, and worked in [[Naples]] (for example on the [[Vasari Sacristy]]), Arezzo and other places. Many of his pictures still exist, the most important being the wall and ceiling paintings in the Sala di Cosimo I in the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in Florence, where he and his assistants were at work from 1555, and the frescoes begun by him inside the vast [[cupola]] of the [[Florence Cathedral|Duomo]] were completed by [[Federico Zuccari]] and with the help of [[Giovanni Balducci]]. He also helped to organize the decoration of the [[Studiolo of Francesco I|Studiolo]], now reassembled in the Palazzo Vecchio.

Among his other pupils or followers are included [[Sebastiano Flori]], [[Bartolomeo Carducci]], Domenico Benci,  Tommaso del Verrocchio, Federigo di Lamberto (Federigo del Padovano), Niccolo Betti, Vittor Casini, [[Mirabello Cavalori]] (Salincorno), Jacopo Coppi (Jacopo di Meglio), Piero di Ridolfo, [[Stefano Veltroni]] of [[Monte San Savino]], Orazio Porta of Monte San Savino, [[Alessandro Fortori]] of Arezzo, Bastiano Flori of Arezzo, Fra Salvatore Foschi of Arezzo, and Andrea Aretino.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BaIZAAAAYAAJ ''The History of Painting in Italy: The Florentine, Sienese, and Roman schools''], by Luigi Lanzi, page 201-202.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Architecture==
Aside from his career as a painter, Vasari was also successful as an architect.&lt;ref&gt;"Vasari's ability as a painter cannot match his talents either as an historian or as an architect," according to [[Lawrence Gowing]], ed., Biographical Encyclopedia of Artists, v.4 (Facts on File, 2005): 695.&lt;/ref&gt; His [[loggia]] of the [[Uffizi|Palazzo degli Uffizi]] by the [[Arno]] opens up the vista at the far end of its long narrow courtyard. It is a unique piece of urban planning that functions as a public piazza, and which, if considered as a short street, is unique as a Renaissance street with a unified architectural treatment. The view of the Loggia from the Arno reveals that, with the [[Vasari Corridor]], it is one of very few structures that line the river which are open to the river itself and appear to embrace the riverside environment.

[[File:Firenze - Uffizi.jpg|thumb|right|The Uffizi Loggia]]
In Florence, Vasari also built the long passage, now called Vasari Corridor, which connects the Uffizi with the [[Palazzo Pitti]] on the other side of the river. The enclosed corridor passes alongside the River Arno on an arcade, crosses the [[Ponte Vecchio]] and winds around the exterior of several buildings. It was once the home of the Mercado de Vecchio.&lt;ref&gt;Pevsner, N., ''A History of Building Types,'' Princeton University Press, 1979, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt;

He also renovated the medieval churches of [[Santa Maria Novella]] and [[Basilica di Santa Croce, Florence|Santa Croce]]. At both he removed the original [[rood screen]] and loft, and remodelled the retro-[[choir]]s in the Mannerist taste of his time.  In Santa Croce, he was responsible for the painting of ''The Adoration of the Magi'' which was commissioned by [[Pope Pius V]] in 1566 and completed in February 1567.  It was recently restored, before being put on exhibition in 2011 in Rome and in Naples.  Eventually it is planned to return it to the church of Santa Croce in [[Bosco Marengo]] (Province of Alessandria, Piedmont).

In 1562 Vasari built the octagonal dome on the [[Basilica of Our Lady of Humility]] in [[Pistoia]], an important example of [[high Renaissance]] architecture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Christian Travelers Guide to Italy'' by David Bershad, Carolina Mangone, Irving Hexham 2001 {{ISBN|0-310-22573-6}}-page [https://books.google.com/books?id=KRkU9ocQr2oC&amp;pg=PA139]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Rome, Vasari worked with [[Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola]] and [[Bartolomeo Ammanati]] at [[Pope Julius III]]'s [[Villa Giulia]].

==''The Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects''==
{{main|Lives of the Most Excellent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects}}
[[File:Vite.jpg|thumb|A cover of the ''Lives'']]
Often called "the first art historian",&lt;ref&gt;[http://arthistorians.info/vasarig Vasari, Giorgio.] Dictionary of Art Historians, 2013. Retrieved 26 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari invented the genre of the encyclopedia of artistic biographies with his ''Le Vite de' più eccellenti pittori, scultori, ed architettori'' (''[[Lives of the Most Eminent Painters, Sculptors, and Architects]]''), dedicated to Grand Duke [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], which was first published in 1550. He was the first to use the term "[[Renaissance]]" (''rinascita'') in print, though an awareness of the ongoing "rebirth" in the arts had been in the air since the time of [[Leone Battista Alberti|Alberti]], and he was responsible for our use of the term [[Gothic Art]], though he only used the word Goth which he associated with the "barbaric" German style. The ''Lives'' also included a novel treatise on the technical methods employed in the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, Giorgio. (1907) ''[https://archive.org/details/vasariontechniqu1907vasa Vasari on technique: being the introduction to the three arts of design, architecture, sculpture and painting, prefixed to the Lives of the most excellent painters, sculptors and architects]''. [[Gerard Baldwin Brown|G. Baldwin Brown]] Ed. Louisa S. Maclehose Trans. London: Dent.&lt;/ref&gt; The book was partly rewritten and enlarged in 1568, with the addition of woodcut portraits of artists (some conjectural).

The work has a consistent and notorious bias in favour of [[Florence, Italy|Florentines]], and tends to attribute to them all the developments in Renaissance art – for example, the invention of [[engraving]]. Venetian art in particular (along with arts from other parts of Europe), is systematically ignored in the first edition. Between the first and second editions, Vasari visited Venice and while the second edition gave more attention to Venetian art (finally including [[Titian]]), it did so without achieving a neutral point of view. There are also many inaccuracies within his ''Lives''. For example, Vasari writes that [[Andrea del Castagno]] killed [[Domenico Veneziano]], which is not true, given Andrea died several years before Domenico.

Vasari's biographies are interspersed with amusing gossip. Many of his anecdotes have the ring of truth, while others are inventions or generic fictions, such as the tale of young [[Giotto]] painting a fly on the surface of a painting by [[Cimabue]] that the older master repeatedly tried to brush away, a genre tale that echoes anecdotes told of the Greek painter Apelles. He did not research archives for exact dates, as modern art historians do, and naturally his biographies are most dependable for the painters of his own generation and those of the immediate past. Modern criticism – with new materials opened up by research – has corrected many of his traditional dates and attributions.

Vasari includes a sketch of his own biography at the end of the ''Lives'', and adds further details about himself and his family in his lives of Lazzaro Vasari and [[Francesco de' Rossi (Il Salviati)|Francesco Salviati]].

According to the historian Richard Goldthwaite,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Goldthwaite, ''The Economy of Renaissance Florence'', 2009, pp. 390.&lt;/ref&gt; Vasari was one of the earliest authors to use the term "competition" (or "concorrenza" in Italian) in its economic sense. He used it repeatedly, and stressed the concept in his introduction to the life of [[Pietro Perugino]], in explaining the reasons for Florentine artistic preeminence. In Vasari's view, Florentine artists excelled because they were hungry, and they were hungry because their fierce competition amongst themselves for commissions kept them so.  Competition, he said, is "one of the nourishments that maintain them."

==Social standing==

Vasari enjoyed high repute during his lifetime and amassed a considerable fortune. In 1547, he built himself a fine house in [[Arezzo]] (now a museum honouring him), and decorated its walls and vaults with paintings. He was elected to the municipal council or priori of his native town, and finally rose to the supreme office of [[gonfalonier]]e.

In 1563, he helped found the Florence [[Accademia delle Arti del Disegno|''Accademia e Compagnia delle Arti del Disegno'']], with the Grand Duke and Michelangelo as ''capi'' of the institution and 36 artists chosen as members.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gauvin Alexander Bailey]], ‘Santi di Tito and the Florentine Academy: Solomon Building the Temple in the Capitolo of the Accademia del Disegno (1570-71),’ Apollo CLV, 480 (February 2002): 31-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hand of God''', or '''Manus Dei''' in Latin, also known as '''Dextera domini/dei''', the "[[right hand of God]]", is a motif in [[Jew]]ish and [[Christian art]], especially of the [[Late Antique]] and [[Early Medieval]] periods, when depiction of [[Jehovah]] or [[God the Father]] as a full human figure was considered unacceptable. The hand, sometimes including a portion of an arm, or ending about the wrist, is used to indicate the intervention in or approval of affairs on Earth by God, and sometimes as a subject in itself. It is an artistic metaphor that is generally not intended to indicate that a hand was physically present or seen at any subject depicted. The Hand is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture (in Christian examples), but sometimes performing an action. In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism"&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0002_0_01141.html "Anthropomorphism"], Jewish Virtual Library, especially the section on Jewish art near the end.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand of God has traditionally been understood as a symbol for God's intervention or approval of human affairs, it is also possible that the hand of God reflects the anthropomorphic conceptions of the deity that may have persisted in late antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Bar Ilan, 321–35; Roth, 191; C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, 97–118; Jensen, 120–21; Paulsen, 105–16; Jill Joshowitz, ''The Hand of God:The Anthropomorphic God of Late Antique Judaism: Archaeological and Textual Perspectives'', (B.A. thesis, Yeshiva University, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The largest group of Jewish imagery from the ancient world, the 3rd century [[Dura-Europos synagogue|synagogue at Dura-Europas]], has the hand of God in five different scenes, including the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'',&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; and no doubt this was one of the many iconographic features taken over by Christian art from what seems to have been a vigorous tradition of Jewish narrative art. Here and elsewhere it often represents the ''[[bath Kol]]'' (literally "daughter of a voice") or voice of God,&lt;ref&gt;A matter disputed by some scholars&lt;/ref&gt; a use also taken over into Christian art.

The hand may also relate to older traditions in various other religions in the [[Ancient Near East]].&lt;ref&gt;Summarized by Hachili, 145&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Amarna art|art of the Amarna period]] in Egypt under [[Akhenaten]], the rays of the [[Aten]] sun-disk end in small hands to suggest the bounty of the supreme deity. Like the [[hamsa]] [[amulet]], the hand is sometimes shown alone on buildings, although it does not seem to have existed as a portable [[amulet]]-type object in Christian use. It is found from the 4th century on in the [[Catacombs of Rome]], including paintings of ''Moses receiving the Law'' and the ''Sacrifice of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Hachili, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

There are numerous references to the hand, or arm, of God in the [[Hebrew Bible]], most clearly metaphorical in the way that remains current in modern English, but some capable of a literal interpretation.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt; They are usually distinguished from references to a placement at the [[right hand of God]]. Later [[rabbinic literature]] also contains a number of references. There are three occasions in the gospels when the voice of God is heard, and the hand often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sacred texts and commentary==
[[File:Abraham und Isaak.JPG|thumb|left|The Hand of God intervenes at the ''Sacrifice of Isaac'', [[Culture of Armenia|Armenian]], [[Akdamar Island|Akdamar]], 10th century]]

===Hebrew Bible===
The hand of God, which encompasses God's arm and fingers as well, is one of the most frequently employed anthropomorphisms of the Hebrew Bible. References to the hand of God occur numerous times in the Pentateuch alone, particularly in regards to the unfolding narrative of the Israelites' exodus from Egypt (cf. Exodus 3:19–20, Exodus 14: 3, 8, 31).&lt;ref&gt;For an overview of scholarship on anthropomorphism in biblical and rabbinic Judaism see Meir Bar Ilan, "The Hand of God: A Chapter in Rabbinic Anthropomorphism", in Rashi 1040–1990 ''Hommage a Ephraim'' E. Urbach ed. Gabrielle Sed Rajna. (1993): 321–35; Edmond Cherbonnier, "The Logic of Biblical Anthropomorphism", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 55.3 (1962): 187–206; Alon Goshen Gottstein, "The Body as Image of God In Rabbinic Literature", ''Harvard Theological Review'' 87.2 (1994): 171–95; Jacob Neusner, ''The Incarnation of God'' (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1988); Morton Smith, "On the Shape of God and Humanity of Gentiles", in ''Religion in Antiquity'' ed. Jacob Neusner (Leiden: Brill, 1968), 315–26; David Stern, "Imitatio Hominis: Anthropomorphism and the Character(s) of God in Rabbinic Literature", ''[[Prooftexts (journal)|Prooftexts]]'' 12.2 (1992): 151– 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
There are no references to the hand of God as an active agent or witness in the New Testament, though there are several to Jesus standing or sitting by the [[right hand of God]] in God's heavenly court,&lt;ref&gt;Mark 16:19, Luke 22:69, Matthew 22:44 and 26:64, Acts 2:34 and 7:55, 1 Peter 3:22&lt;/ref&gt; a conventional term for the place of honour beside a host or senior family member. For example, when Stephen is filled with the "holy spirit" he looks to heaven and sees Jesus standing by the right hand of God (Acts 7:55). There are three occasions in the [[Gospels]] when the voice of God is heard, and the hand of God often represents this in visual art.&lt;ref&gt;"in Ravenna and in Western art from the ninth until the eleventh centuries" according to Schiller I, 149, although Western examples of the hand in depictions of these occasions extend well before and after these dates.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rabbinic literature===
[[Anthropomorphic]] [[aggadot]] regarding the hand of God appear frequently in the corpus of rabbinic literature and expand upon anthropomorphic biblical narratives.

==Christian art==
[[File:Apsis mosaic San Clemente n2.jpg|thumb|right|Clothed hand clutching wreath, [[San Clemente, Rome]], 1140–43.]]
In Christian art, the hand of God has traditionally been understood as an artistic metaphor that is not intended to indicate that the deity was physically present or seen in any subject depicted. In the late antique and early medieval periods, the representation of the full-bodied figure of God the Father would have been considered a grave violation of the Second Commandment.&lt;ref&gt;Linda and Peter Murray, "Trinity", in ''The Oxford Companion to Christian Art and Architecture'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1998), 544.&lt;/ref&gt; According to conventional art historical interpretation, the representation of the hand of God in early Christian art thus developed as a necessary and symbolic compromise to the highly anti-anthropomorphic tenor of the Second Commandment, though anthropomorphic interpretations are certainly plausible.&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Griffith and David Paulsen, "Augustine and the Corporeality of God", ''[[Harvard Theological Review]]'' 95.1 (2002): 97–118; Robin Jensen, Face to Face: Portraits of the Divine in Early Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress, 2005), 120–21; David Paulsen, "Early Christian Belief in a Corporeal Deity: Origen and Augustine as Reluctant Witnesses", Harvard Theological Review, 83.2 (1990): 105–16.&lt;/ref&gt; In early Christian and Byzantine art, the hand of God is seen appearing from above in a fairly restricted number of narrative contexts, often in a [[blessing]] gesture, but sometimes performing an action. Gertrud Schiller distinguishes three functions of the hand in Christian art: as symbol of either God's presence or the voice of God, or signifying God's acceptance of a sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II 674 (Index headings)&lt;/ref&gt; In later Christian works it tends to be replaced by a [[God the Father in Western art|fully realized figure of God the Father]], whose depiction had become acceptable in [[Western Christianity]], although not in [[Eastern Orthodox]] or Jewish art.&lt;ref name="JVL Anthropomorphism" /&gt;

===Iconography===
The motif of the hand, with no body attached, provides a problem for the artist in how to terminate it. In Christian narrative images the hand most often emerges from a small cloud, at or near the top of the image, but in iconic contexts it may appear cut off in the picture space, or spring from a border, or a victor's [[wreath]] (left). A cloud is mentioned as the source of the voice of God in the gospel accounts of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]] (see below). Several of the examples in the [[Dura Europos synagogue]] (see below) show a good part of the forearm as well as the hand, which is not found in surviving Christian examples, and most show an open palm, sometimes with the fingers spread out. Later examples in Jewish art are closer in form to Christian styles.

In Christian art, the hand of God usually occupies the form of a blessing gesture, if they are not performing an action, though some just show an open hand. The normal blessing gesture is to point with the index and next finger, with the other fingers curled back and thumb relaxed. There is also a more complicated Byzantine gesture that attempts to represent the Greek letter ''[[Chi (letter)|chi]]'', [[Christ]]'s initial, which looks like a Latin letter "X". This is formed by crossing the thumb and little finger inside the palm, with only the forefinger and next one extended,&lt;ref&gt;Didron, I, 201–3&lt;/ref&gt; or a variant of this.

Especially in Roman mosaics, but also in some German imperial commissions, for example on the [[Lothair Cross]], the hand is clenched around a wreath that goes upwards, and behind which the arm then disappears, forming a tidy circular motif. Especially in these examples, the hand may show the sleeve of a garment, sometimes of two layers, as at [[San Clemente, Rome]]. In blessing forms the hand often has a [[Halo (art)|halo]], which also may provide a convenient termination point. This may or may not be a cruciform halo, indicating the divinity, and specifically the [[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]], or [[Pre-existing Christ]] (see below).
[[File:San Pedro de la Nave capitel.JPG|thumb|left|[[Visigoth]]ic capital with the ''[[Sacrifice of Isaac]]''.]]

The hand is regularly seen in depictions of certain scenes, though it may occur on occasion in a much wider range.&lt;ref&gt;See index of Schiller II under "Hand of God"&lt;/ref&gt; In many scenes one or more angels, acting as the messengers of God, may appear instead of the hand. A virtually unique mosaic depiction of the ''[[Ark of the Covenant]]'' (806) at [[Germigny-des-Prés]], also features the hand of God.

In Christian art the hand will often actually represent the hand of [[God the Son]], or the Logos; this is demonstrated when later depictions start to substitute for the Hand a small half-length portrait of Christ as Logos in a similar circular frame. It is nearly always Christ in the East, but in the West God the Father will sometimes be shown in this way. However, in many contexts the person of the Trinity intended cannot be confirmed from the image alone, except in those images, like the ''[[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]]'', where Jesus the [[Incarnate Christ]] is also present, where the hand is clearly that of God the Father. Later [[Eastern Orthodox]] images often identify Hands as the Logos with the usual monogram used in [[icon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;For example [[:File:St George - Pskov school.jpg|in this icon]], as compared to [[:File:Borisgleb riding.jpg|this one]], which shows the Hand replaced with a Christ/Logos.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Old Testament imagery====
*In the [[Vienna Genesis]] the hand appears above the ''Expulsion of [[Adam and Eve]] from [[Paradise]]''. More often, God was shown in this story using the conventional [[depiction of Jesus]] representing the pre-existent Christ or ''[[Logos (Christianity)|Logos]]'', who was seen as the Creator by Early Christian writers,&lt;ref&gt;The account in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] naturally credits the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]] to the single figure of God, in Christian terms, God the Father. However the first person plural in Genesis 1:26 "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness", and New Testament references to Christ as creator (John 1:3, Colossians 1:15) led Early Christian writers to associate the Creation with the [[Logos]].&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Adam and Eve was the Old Testament subject most frequently seen in Christian art that needed a pictorial representation of God. A well known modern variant of the traditional hand motif is a sculpture of 1898 by [[Auguste Rodin]] called the ''Hand of God'', which shows a gigantic hand creating Adam and Eve.
*The [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] first appears in Christian art in 4th century depictions from the Roman catacombs and sarcophagi, as well as pieces like a fragment from a marble table from [[Cyprus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kurt Weitzmann|Weitzmann, Kurt]], ed., ''[http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15324coll10/id/156533 Age of spirituality : late antique and early Christian art, third to seventh century]'', no. 380, 1979, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, {{ISBN|978-0-87099-179-0}}; full text available online from The Metropolitan Museum of Art Libraries.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abraham]] is restrained by the hand, which in the [[Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus]] grasped his knife hand, as the angel often does in other depictions.&lt;ref&gt;Though both hand and knife are now missing, with only a wrist stump now remaining.&lt;/ref&gt; However the angel mentioned in the biblical text is more usual, and often included as well. The use of the hand in this scene, at least in Christian art, indicates God's acceptance of the sacrifice, as well as his intervention to change it.
[[File:Paris psaulter gr139 fol422v.jpg|thumb|[[Moses]] receives the [[Tablets of the Law]], and hears the call of God. [[Paris Psalter]].]]
*Some depictions have the hand passing [[Moses]] the [[Tablets of the Law]], found in the Roman catacombs, various Bibles (see gallery), the [[Paris Psalter]], and in mosaic in the [[Basilica of San Vitale]], [[Ravenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Noga-Banai, Galit. ''The Trophies of the Martyrs: An Art Historical Study of Early Christian Silver Reliquaries'', Oxford University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-19-921774-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-921774-8}} [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BUyGDWSsi4sC&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=Dura-Europos+Moses+receiving+the+law#v=onepage&amp;q=Dura-Europos%20Moses%20receiving%20the%20law&amp;f=false Google books]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The prophet [[Ezekiel]] (2:9–10) received his prophecy by hand: "Then I looked, and I saw a hand stretched out to me. In it was a scroll, which he unrolled before me. On both sides of it were written words of lament and mourning and woe"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+2&amp;version=NIV Ezekiel Ch. 2], NIV&lt;/ref&gt; and this and other moments from Ezekiel sometimes include the hand. In the [[Paris Psalter]], Moses, [[Jonah]] and [[Isaiah]] are all shown blessed by hands, from which rays of light come. Other prophets are sometimes also shown with the hand.
*In the [[Klosterneuburg]] Altar, [[Drogo Sacramentary]] (shown below) and San Vitale, Ravenna, [[Melchizedek]] is shown blessed by it, in the last combined with [[Abel]]. This relates to the approval of his sacrifice mentioned in the biblical text, and possibly also to the hand's association with divinely ordained monarchy (see below), as Melchizedek was both priest and king according to [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18–20, and his appearance in art is often to evoke this as well as his function as a [[typology (theology)|type]] for Christ.
*The hand can appear in other contexts; the Carolingian [[Utrecht Psalter]] atypically illustrates nearly all the [[Psalms]], probably following an Antique model, and shows the hand in at least 27 of these images, despite also using a figure of Christ-as-God in the heavens even more frequently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psalter.library.uu.nl/default.asp Utrecht Psalter online] – for hands see Psalms 2,5,14,21–23,26,29,40,42,48,53–55,63,77,83,86,105,111,118,123–125,132,136–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A mosaic in the [[Mausoleum of Galla Placidia]] in Ravenna shows the battle of [[Beth-horon]] with the [[Amorites]] ([[Joshua]], 10:11), where: "As they fled before Israel on the road down from Beth Horon to Azekah, the LORD hurled large hailstones down on them from the sky, and more of them died from the hailstones than were killed by the swords of the Israelites" – with a large hand representing God.
*The story in [[Book of Daniel|Daniel]] 5:1–31 of [[the writing on the wall]] is rarely depicted until the 17th century, when [[Belshazzar's Feast (Rembrandt)|Rembrandt's well known version]] and others were produced.

====New Testament imagery====

*In depictions of the ''[[Life of Christ in art|Life of Christ]]'', the hand often appears at the [[Baptism of Jesus|Baptism of Christ]] representing the voice of God, above the [[dove]] representing the [[Holy Spirit]], which is much more common, thus showing the whole [[Trinity]] as present and active.&lt;ref&gt;Grabar, 115 &amp; Schiller, I pp. 134 &amp; 137–9&lt;/ref&gt; The hand never seems to appear without the dove, as the Holy Spirit as a dove is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark: "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased."&lt;ref&gt;Mark 3:16–17 NIV; all three [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice.&lt;/ref&gt; Both dove and hand are normally located centrally, pointing straight down at Jesus. The hand is mostly found in ''Baptism''s between the 6th (e.g. [[Rabbula Gospels]]) and 11th centuries.
*The hand is found in some Western and later Armenian scenes of the [[Transfiguration of Jesus]],&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 148–151. See also [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=riNIXZzr_NcC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=%22hand+of+God%22+iconography&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=%22hand%20of%20God%22%20iconography&amp;f=false Mathews, p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; where again the [[Synoptic Gospels]] have the voice of God speaking, this time from a cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bible.cc/matthew/3-17.htm Bible texts and commentaries]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The hand is sometimes seen in the [[Agony in the Garden]], though an angel is more common. This is the third and final occasion when the voice of God is mentioned in the gospels, this time only in the [[Gospel of John]] (12:28). The earliest known example is in the [[St Augustine Gospels]] of c.600.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 49&lt;/ref&gt;
*From [[Carolingian art]] until the [[Romanesque art|Romanesque period]], the hand may appear above the top of the cross in the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], pointing straight down. Sometimes it holds a wreath over Christ's head, as on the rear of the [[Ottonian art|Ottonian]] [[Lothair Cross]] at [[Aachen Cathedral]]. The hand represents divine approval, and specifically acceptance of his sacrifice,&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, II, 107–108 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and possibly also the storm mentioned in the gospels.
*The hand may be seen in the [[Ascension of Christ]], sometimes, as in the [[Drogo Sacramentary]], reaching down and clasping that of Christ, as though to pull him up into the clouds. The ivory plaque now in [[Munich]] (left) with such a depiction is possibly the earliest [[Ascension of Jesus in Christian art|representation of the Ascension]] to survive. 
*In [[Eastern Orthodox]] [[icon]]s of the [[Last Judgement]], the hand often holds the scales in which souls are weighed (in the West [[Saint Michael]] typically does this). The hand may emerge from the [[Hetoimasia]] usually present, and is typically huge in size compared to the full figures nearby in the composition.

====Divine approval of rulers imagery====
[[File:Main Justice Louvre.jpg|thumb|upright|The recreated "Hand of Justice" used in [[Napoleon]]'s coronation, [[Musée du Louvre]].]]
The hand often blesses rulers from above, especially in Carolingian and Ottonian works, and coins. The hand may hold a wreath or crown over the ruler's head, or place it on the head. A posthumous coin of [[Constantine the Great]] (the "deification issue") had shown the hand reaching down to pull up a veiled figure of Constantine in a [[quadriga]], in a famously mixed message that combined pagan conventions, where an [[eagle]] drew deified emperors up to the heavens, with Christian iconography. From the late 4th century coins of Late Antique rulers such as [[Arcadius]] (and his empress), [[Galla Placidia]] and others show them being crowned by it – it was in fact mostly used for empresses, and often only appears on issues from the Eastern Empire.&lt;ref&gt;''Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius'', Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88402-193-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-88402-193-3}}
[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sdCjnwoQLR0C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=coin+crowned+by+%22hand+of+god%22&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google books] gives a full account of Late Antique usage. See also [http://www.davidrsear.com/academy/roman_glossary.html#Manus David Sear] coin glossary&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is not then seen in [[Byzantine art]] until the late 10th century, when it appears in coins of [[John I Tzimisces]] (969–976), long after it was common in the West.&lt;ref&gt;Zach Margulies, [http://www.forumancientcoins.com/numiswiki/view.asp?key=christian%20themes%20in%20byzantine%20coinage "Christian Themes in Byzantine Coinage, 307 - 1204"]&lt;/ref&gt; In later Byzantine miniatures figures the hand is often replaced by a full figure of Christ (in these examples much smaller than the Emperor) placing a crown on the head.&lt;ref&gt;Examples [[:File:Basilios II.jpg|here]] and [[:File:Nicephorus III and Maria of Alania BnF Coislin79 fol2bis.jpg|here]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar symbolism was represented by the "Main de Justice" ("Hand of Justice"), part of the traditional [[French Crown Jewels#Sceptre of Charles V and Main de Justice|French Coronation Regalia]], which was a [[sceptre]] in the form of a short gold rod surmounted by an [[ivory]] hand in the blessing gesture. The object now in the [[Louvre]] is a recreation, made for Napoleon or a restored Bourbon king, of the original, which was destroyed in the [[French Revolution]], although the original ivory hand has survived (now displayed separately). [[Engraved gem]]s are used for an authentic medieval feel. Here the hand represents the justice-dispensing power of God as being literally in the hands of the king.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

====Saints imagery====
[[File:BambergGregoryUnkFolDedicationMin.jpg|thumb|[[Presentation miniature]] in a copy of [[St Gregory]]'s ''[[Moralia in Job]]'', 11th century.]]
The hand can also be shown with images of saints, either actioning a [[miracle]] associated with a saint – in Catholic theology it is God who performs all miracles – or above an iconic scene. In the [[Bayeux Tapestry]] the hand appears over [[Westminster Abbey]] in the scene showing the funeral of [[Edward the Confessor]]. The hand sometimes appears (see gallery) in scenes of the murder of [[martyr]]s like St [[Thomas Becket]], clearly indicating neither involvement nor approval of the deed, but approval of the saint. In the [[dedication miniature]] shown, the blessing hand seems pointed neither at [[Emperor Henry III]], nor [[St Gregory]] or the abbot, but at the copy of Gregory's book – the same copy that contains this miniature. This looser usage of the motif reaches its peak in Romanesque art, where it occasionally appears in all sorts of contexts – indicating the "right" speaker in a miniature of a [[disputation]], or as the only decoration at the top of a monastic [[charter]]. A number of Anglo-Saxon coins of [[Edward the Elder]] and [[Æthelred the Unready]] has a large hand dominating their reverse sides, although religious symbols were rarely so prominent on Anglo-Saxon coins.&lt;ref&gt;Casson, 274 &amp; illustration on 269&lt;/ref&gt;

====Icons====
In [[Eastern Orthodox]] icons the hand remained in use far longer than in the Western church, and is still found in modern icons, normally emerging from circular bands. Apart from the narrative scenes mentioned above it is especially often found in icons of [[military saint]]s, and in some Russian icons is identified by the usual inscription as belonging to Jesus Christ. In other versions of the same composition a small figure of Christ of about the same size as the hand takes its place, which is also seen in many Western works from about 1000 onwards.
 
The earliest surviving [[icon]] of the [[Virgin Mary]], of about 600 from [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], has an often overlooked hand, suggesting to Robin Cormack that the emphasis of the subject is on the [[Incarnation]] rather than a simple [[Virgin and Child]].&lt;ref&gt;See also the apse mosaic of the [[Euphrasian Basilica]], from about the 550s, which has a very similar composition.&lt;/ref&gt; Another of the very few major Eastern works showing the Virgin from before the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]], an apse mosaic (lost in 1922) from [[İznik|Nicaea]], also shows the hand above a standing Virgin. Few similar uses of the hand are seen in later Virgins, though the iconographically adventurous Byzantine [[Chludov Psalter]] (9th century) has a small miniature showing the hand and dove above a Virgin &amp; Child.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I, p. 7 &amp; fig. 3&lt;/ref&gt; The hand occasionally appears in Western ''[[Annunciation]]s'', even as late as [[Simone Martini]] in the 14th century, by which time the dove, sometimes accompanied by a small image of God the Father, has become more common.&lt;ref&gt;Schiller, I pp. 43,44,45,47, figs 82, 97, 108&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BMprintAN00343789 001 l.jpg|thumb|left|220px|Anonymous print on the situation of the Netherlands in the 1570s, with three hands]]

====Ravenna mosaics====
The hand appears at the top of a number of Late Antique [[apse]] mosaics in Rome and Ravenna, above a variety of compositions that feature either Christ or the cross,&lt;ref&gt;One previously at [[Santi Cosma e Damiano]] (for example, see Dodwell, p. 5), seems now to have been restored away. Others are in [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], [[Santa Prassede]], and others illustrated here or on Commons.&lt;/ref&gt; some covered by the regular contexts mentioned above, but others not. The motif is then repeated in much later mosaics from the 12th century.

====Late Medieval and early Renaissance art====
From the 14th century, and earlier in some contexts, [[God the Father in Western art|full figures of God the Father]] became increasingly common in Western art, though still controversial and rare in the Orthodox world. Naturally such figures all have hands, which use the blessing and other gestures in a variety of ways. It may be noted that the most famous of all such uses, [[Michelangelo]]'s creating hand of God in the [[Sistine Chapel ceiling]], breaks clear of God's encircling robe above the wrist, and is shown against a plain background in a way reminiscent of many examples of the earlier motif.

The motif did not disappear in later iconography, and enjoyed a revival in the 15th century as the range of religious subjects greatly expanded and depiction of God the Father became controversial again among Protestants. The prints of [[Daniel Hopfer]] and others make frequent use of the hand in a variety of contexts, and the personal [[emblem]] of [[John Calvin]] was a heart held in the Hand. Very free use of the motif is made in prints relating to the religious and political fall-out of the Reformation over the next two centuries, in prints on the [[Dutch Revolt]] for example. In a high [[Rococo]] setting at the [[Windberg Abbey]], [[Lower Bavaria]], the Hand of God holds scales in which a lily stem indicating Saint Catherine's purity outweighs the crown and sceptre of worldly pomp.

The similar but essentially unrelated arm-reliquary was a popular form during the medieval period when the hand was most used. Typically these are in precious metal, showing the hand and most of the forearm, pointing up erect from a flat base where the arm stopped. They contained [[relic]]s, usually from that part of the body of the saint, and it was the saint's hand that was represented.

==Examples in late antique and medieval Jewish art==
[[File:Ezekiel 3.jpeg|thumb|Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones cycle [[Dura Europos synagogue]]]]
The hand of God appears in several examples from the small surviving body of figurative Jewish religious art. It is especially prominent in the wall paintings of the third-century [[Dura Europos synagogue]], and also seen in the nave mosaic of the sixth century [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, and on a sixth-seventh century [[Bema#Judaism|bimah]] screen found at the fourth-fifth century [[Susiya]] synagogue.&lt;ref&gt;Cecil Roth, "Anthropomorphism, Jewish Art", in ''Encyclopedia Judaica'', ed. Fred Skolnik and Michael Berenbaum (Thomson Gale; Detroit : Macmillan Reference USA, 2007), 191 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Dura Europos synagogue===
In the Dura Europos synagogue, the hand of God appears ten times, in five out of the twenty-nine biblically themed wall paintings including the ''Binding of Isaac'', ''Moses and the Burning Bush'', ''Exodus and Crossing of the Red Sea'', ''Elijah Reviving the Child of the Widow of Zarepheth'', and ''Ezekiel in the Valley of Dry Bones''.&lt;ref&gt;Kraeling, 57&lt;/ref&gt;  In several examples the hand includes the forearm as well.

===Beth Alpha synagogue===
[[File:Beit alfa02.jpg|thumbnail|right|Binding of Isaac mosaic, [[Beth Alpha]]]]
In the [[Beth Alpha]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the ''Binding of Isaac'' panel on the northern entryway of the synagogue's nave mosaic floor.&lt;ref&gt;Eleazar Sukenik, ''The Synagogue at Beth Alpha'', 40.&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God appearing in the Beth Alpha ''Binding of Isaac'' mosaic panel is depicted as a disembodied hand emerging from a fiery ball of smoke, "directing the drama and its outcome" according to [[Meyer Schapiro]].&lt;ref&gt;Shapiro, 30&lt;/ref&gt; The hand of God is positioned strategically in the upper center of the composition, directly above the ram that the angel of God instructs Abraham to sacrifice in place of Isaac.

===Susiya synagogue===

In the [[Susiya]] synagogue, the hand of God appears on the defaced remains of a marble bimah screen that perhaps once illustrated a biblical scene such as ''Moses Receiving the Law'' or the ''Binding of Isaac''.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Werlin, "Khirbet Susiya" in ''The Late Ancient Synagogues of Southern Palestine'', (Ph.D. diss., University of North Carolina Chapel Hill, 2012): 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the hand was subjected to intense [[iconoclastic]] hacking, the iconoclasts left some vestiges of the thumb and the receding fingers intact.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Fine, "Iconoclasm: Who Defeated this Jewish Art", ''Bible Review'' (2000): 32-43; Robert Shick, "Iconoclasm", in ''The Christian Communities of Palestine from Byzantine to Islamic Rule: A Historical and Archaeological Study'' (Darwin Press Inc.: Princeton, N.J.), 213.&lt;/ref&gt; A thumbnail has been carved into the thumb. Foerster asserts that the hand of God originally held a Torah scroll, identifying the small piece of raised marble located between the thumb and fingers as a Torah scroll.&lt;ref&gt;Foerster, ''Decorated Marble Chancel Screens'', 1820.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Birdhea5.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Birds' Head Haggadah]]]]

===Birds' Head Haggadah===
{{main|Birds' Head Haggadah}}
The hand of God appears in the early 14th-century [[Haggadah]], the [[Birds' Head Haggadah]], produced in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;"Bird's Head Haggadah", Israel Museum Digital Catalogue, Israel Museum, Jerusalem http://www.english.imjnet.org.il/popup?c0=13475.&lt;/ref&gt; Two hands of God appear underneath the text of the ''[[Dayenu]]'' song, dispensing the [[manna]] from heaven. The Birds' Head Haggadah is a particularly important visual source from the medieval period, as it is the earliest surviving example of a medieval illuminated Hebrew Haggadah.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14308">Since prehistoric times,  significant changes in communication technologies (media and appropriate inscription tools) have evolved in tandem with shifts in political and economic systems, and by extension, systems of power. Communication can range from very subtle processes of exchange, to full conversations and mass communication. Human communication was revolutionized with the [[origin of speech]] approximately 500,000 BCE. Symbols were developed about 30,000 years ago.
The imperfection of speech, which nonetheless allowed easier dissemination of ideas and stimulated [[invention]]s, eventually resulted in the creation of new forms of communications, improving both the range at which people could communicate and the longevity of the information. All of those inventions were based on the key concept of the symbol.

The oldest known  symbols created for the purpose of communication were [[cave paintings]], a form of [[rock art]], dating to the [[Upper Paleolithic]] age. The oldest known cave painting is located within [[Chauvet Cave]], dated to around 30,000 [[Anno Domini|BC]].&lt;ref name="Paul Martin Lester"/&gt; These paintings contained increasing amounts of information: people may have created the first [[calendar]] as far back as 15,000 years ago.&lt;ref name="rappenglueck"/&gt; The connection between drawing and writing is further shown by [[linguistics]]: in  [[Ancient Egypt]] and [[Ancient Greece]] the concepts and words of drawing and writing were one and the same (Egyptian: 's-sh', Greek: 'graphein').&lt;ref name="David Diringer BBP"/&gt;

==Petroglyphs==
{{Details|Petroglyphs}}
[[File:Haljesta.jpg|thumb|right|92x92px|Petroglyphs from [[Häljesta]], Sweden. Nordic [[Bronze Age]] ]]

The next advancement in the history of communications came with the production of [[petroglyph]]s, carvings into a rock surface. It took about 20,000 years for homo sapiens to move from the first cave paintings to the first petroglyphs, which are dated to approximately the Neolithic and late Upper Paleolithic boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago.

It is possible that humans of that time used some other forms of communication, often for [[mnemonic]] purposes - specially arranged stones, symbols carved in wood or earth, [[quipu]]-like ropes, [[tattoo]]s, but little other than the most durable carved stones has survived to modern times and we can only speculate about their existence based on our observation of still existing 'hunter-gatherer' cultures such as those of [[Africa]] or [[Oceania]].&lt;ref name="David Diringer HotA"/&gt;

==Pictograms==
{{Details|Pictograms}}
[[File:Piktograf1.png|thumb|right|150px|Pictograph from 1510 telling a story of coming of [[missionaries]] to [[Hispaniola]] ]]

A [[pictogram]] (pictograph) is a [[symbol]] representing a [[concept]], [[Object (philosophy)|object]], activity, place or event by [[illustration]]. Pictography is a form of [[proto-writing]] whereby [[idea]]s are transmitted through [[drawing]]. Pictographs were the next step in the evolution of communication: the most important difference between petroglyphs and pictograms is that petroglyphs are simply showing an event, but
pictograms are telling a story about the event, thus they can for example be ordered [[chronological]]ly.

Pictograms were used by various ancient [[culture]]s all over the world since around 9000&amp;nbsp;BC, when tokens marked with simple pictures began to be used to label basic farm produce, and become increasingly popular around 6000–5000&amp;nbsp;BC.

They were the basis of [[Cuneiform (script)|cuneiform]] &lt;ref name="Linguistics 201: The Invention of Writing"/&gt; and [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]], and began to develop into [[logogram|logographic]] [[writing system]]s around 5000&amp;nbsp;BC.

==Ideograms==
{{Details|Ideograms}}
[[File:Our Father in heaven - Mikmaq hierogl.gif|frame|right|The beginning of the Lord's Prayer in [[Míkmaq hieroglyphic writing]]. The text reads ''Nujjinen wásóq'' – "Our father / in heaven".]]

Pictograms, in turn, evolved into ideograms, graphical symbols that represent an [[idea]]. Their ancestors, the pictograms, could represent only something resembling their form: therefore a pictogram of a circle could represent a sun, but not concepts like 'heat', 'light', 'day' or 'Great God of the Sun'. Ideograms, on the other hand, could convey more abstract concepts, so that for example an ideogram of two sticks can mean not only 'legs' but also a verb 'to walk'.

Because some ideas are universal, many different cultures developed similar ideograms. For example, an eye with a tear means 'sadness' in [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] ideograms in [[California]], as it does for the [[Aztec]]s, the early [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Ideograms were precursors of [[logogram|logographic writing systems]] such as [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] and [[Chinese character]]s. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Examples of ideographical proto-writing systems, thought not to contain language-specific information, include the [[Vinca script]] (see also [[Tărtăria tablets]]) and the early [[Indus script]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} In both cases there are claims of decipherment of linguistic content, without wide acceptance. {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Writing==
{{Details|History of writing}}
[[File:Sumerian 26th c Adab.jpg|thumb|250px|26th century&amp;nbsp;BC Sumerian [[cuneiform script]] in [[Sumerian language]], listing gifts to the high priestess of [[Adab (city)|Adab]] on the occasion of her election. One of the earliest examples of human [[writing]].]]

The oldest-known forms of writing were primarily [[logogram|logographic]] in nature, based on [[pictogram|pictographic]] and [[ideogram|ideographic]] elements. Most writing systems can be broadly divided into three categories: ''logographic'', ''syllabic'' and ''alphabetic'' (or ''segmental''); however, all three may be found in any given writing system in varying  proportions, often making it difficult to categorise a system uniquely.

The invention of the first [[writing system]]s is roughly contemporary with the beginning of the [[Bronze Age]] in the late [[Neolithic]] of the late 4000&amp;nbsp;BC. The first writing system is generally believed to have been invented in pre-historic [[Sumer]] and developed by the late [[3rd millennium BC|3000's&amp;nbsp;BC]] into [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]]. [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and the undeciphered [[Proto-Elamite]] writing system and [[Indus script|Indus Valley script]] also date to this era, though a few scholars have questioned the [[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Valley]] script's status as a writing system.

The original Sumerian writing system was derived from a system of [[clay]] [[Token coin|tokens]] used to represent [[commodities]]. By the end of the 4th millennium&amp;nbsp;BC, this had evolved into a method of keeping [[Account (accountancy)|accounts]], using a round-shaped [[stylus]] impressed into soft clay at different angles for recording [[number]]s. This was gradually augmented with pictographic writing using a sharp stylus to indicate what was being counted. Round-stylus and sharp-stylus writing was gradually replaced about 2700–2000&amp;nbsp;BC by writing using a wedge-shaped stylus (hence the term [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]]), at first only for [[logogram]]s, but developed to include [[phonetic]] elements by the 2800&amp;nbsp;BC. About 2600&amp;nbsp;BC cuneiform began to represent syllables of spoken [[Sumerian language]].

Finally, cuneiform writing became a general purpose writing system for [[logogram]]s, [[syllable]]s, and numbers. By the 26th century&amp;nbsp;BC, this script had been adapted to another Mesopotamian language, [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], and from there to others such as [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Hittite language|Hittite]]. Scripts similar in appearance to this writing system include those for [[Ugaritic language|Ugaritic]] and [[Old Persian language|Old Persian]].

The [[Chinese script]] may have originated independently of the Middle Eastern scripts, around the 16th century&amp;nbsp;BC (early [[Shang Dynasty]]), out of a late neolithic Chinese system of proto-writing dating back to c. 6000&amp;nbsp;BC. The pre-Columbian writing systems of the [[Americas]], including [[Olmec]] and [[Maya script|Mayan]], are also generally believed to have had independent origins.

===Alphabet===
{{Details|History of the alphabet}}
[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''A Specimen'' of typeset fonts and languages, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]''.]]

The first pure [[alphabet]]s (properly, "[[abjad]]s", mapping single symbols to single phonemes, but not necessarily each phoneme to a symbol) emerged around 2000&amp;nbsp;BC in [[Ancient Egypt]], but by then alphabetic principles had already been incorporated into [[Egyptian hieroglyph]]s for a millennium (see [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets]]).

By 2700&amp;nbsp;BC, Egyptian writing had a set of some [[Egyptian hieroglyph#Uniliteral signs|22 hieroglyphs]] to represent syllables that begin with a single [[consonant]] of their language, plus a vowel (or no vowel) to be supplied by the native speaker. These glyphs were used as pronunciation guides for [[logogram]]s, to write grammatical inflections, and, later, to transcribe loan words and foreign names.

However, although seemingly alphabetic in nature, the original Egyptian uniliterals were not a system and were never used by themselves to encode Egyptian speech. In the [[Middle Bronze Age]] an apparently "alphabetic" system is thought by some to have been developed in central [[Egypt]] around 1700&amp;nbsp;BC for or by [[Semitic people|Semitic]] workers, but we cannot read these early writings and their exact nature remains open to interpretation.

Over the next five centuries this Semitic "alphabet" (really a [[syllabary]] like [[Phoenician writing]]) seems to have spread north. All subsequent alphabets around the world{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} with the sole exception of Korean [[Hangul]] have either descended from it, or been inspired by one of its descendants.

==History of telecommunication==
{{Details|History of telecommunication}}
The [[history of telecommunication]] - the [[Transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[Signal (electrical engineering)|signals]] over a distance for the purpose of [[communication]] - began thousands of years ago with the use of [[smoke signal]]s and [[drum (communication)|drums]] in [[Africa]], [[United States|America]] and parts of [[Asia]]. In the 1790s the first fixed [[Semaphore line|semaphore systems]] emerged in [[Europe]] however it was not until the 1830s that [[electrical]] [telecommunication] systems started to appear.

The '''Indonesian ceremonial bronze axes''' were [[Bronze Age]] objects that were produced in the [[Nusantara|Indonesian archipelago]] between the 1st and 2nd century AD. Archaeological sites in [[Java]], [[Bali]], [[Sulawesi]], the eastern islands, and around [[Lake Sentani]] in [[Papua (province)|Papua]] have been uncovered, showing the bronze axes at the center of a bronze production or at burial sites. They are a testimony of the extensive trade network in the islands of the archipelago in the first millennium AD, thought to be connected to the [[Dong Son culture]].  

==Archaeology== 
[[File:MET 29G A29AR4.jpg|thumb|left|Blade-shaped bronze axe contains delicate pattern and are too weak to be used as weapon or agricultural tools, which indicates their ceremonial use.]]
The first record of metalwork in the Indonesian archipelago was around 500 BC. Most of the earliest bronze objects were probably used for ceremonies e.g. highly-stylized axes and [[kettledrum]]s. Findings of bronze objects from this period are numerous in Indonesia. Even people in the eastern side of Indonesia, that had not shown any signs of contact with Hinduism coming from the Indian subcontinent, had developed sophisticated metal-working techniques. Bronze must have been imported into these islands, because many small-sized islands e.g. [[Bali]] or [[Rote Island|Rote]], did not mine copper nor tin, the raw materials for bronze-making, and yet bronze artifacts were found to be produced extensively in these islands.{{sfn|Miksic|2001|p=33}} 

Ceremonial bronze axes continued to be developed during the pre-Classic era from the 1st to 2nd century AD. During this period, bronze-casting industries flourished, especially in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. These industries were probably instrumental in the manufacture of various kinds of bronze objects in Indonesia, including the ceremonial bronze axes. Various types of bronze axes were discovered across Indonesia e.g. numerous swallow-tail socketed bronze axes found in Java, the large axe with anthropomorphic carving e.g. those found in [[Rote Island]] and [[Makassar]], and the curved bronze blade found in many sizes including miniatures.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=39}} These archaeological findings of bronze objects production center and various sites indicating their use in a ceremony indicate a thriving inter-island trade in the [[Nusantara|Indonesian archipelago]] in the first millennium AD.{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}} 

==Form==
There are various forms of ceremonial bronze axes found in Indonesia. The similarities between these bronze axes are their artistic delicate patterns and their delicate fragile design which indicate their ceremonial use. A bronze ceremonial axe discovered in Landu on North [[Rote Island|Rote]] in 1875, contains anthropomorphic designs decorated with geometric patterns e.g. concentric circles, fish-bone pattern, and spirals, is very similar with the early art of the southwest Pacific; but with additional geometric motifs also found in bronze objects coming from mainland Asia, e.g. striated pattern.{{sfn|Heekeren|2013|p=11}} This is very similar with those discovered in Sulawesi, such as the Makassar Axe which was kept in the [[National Museum of Indonesia]].{{sfn|Bellwood|2001|p=38}}

This type of enormous bronze axes was produced using [[lost-wax casting]] in two parts which was then combined in the middle. The final object contains a hollow. This well-decorated bronze axe was without a doubt ceremonial in use, but the exact nature of the use is unknown. Being hollow (because the two parts were combined into one), it may have been used as a water vessel, or hanged as percussive instrument, or simply acted as heirloom objects as a symbol of status in important ceremonies.{{sfn|Heekeren|2013|p=10}}

Swallow-tail socketed bronze axes were found in Java. An exceptionally large axe discovered in [[Bogor]] have its swallowtail part adorned on one of its surface by a roughly drawn mask with bud-shaped eyes.

Other types of Indonesian ceremonial bronze axe is the curved blade which have been discovered everywhere in the archipelago from [[West Java]] (e.g. at [[Bandung]]) to [[Sulawesi]]. The blade-shaped bronze axe were produced in full size and as miniatures. Although looks like a weapon, its elegant blade is not strong enough for any practical use in both warfare or agriculture.{{sfn|I Wayan Ardika|2001|p=41}}

Illustration of these axes carried by plumed warriors appears on various bronze objects across the archipelago and northern Vietnam, the origin of the [[Dong Son drum]].

The '''International Geography Olympiad''' ('''iGeo''') is an annual competition for 16- to 19-year-old [[geography]] students from all over the world. Students chosen to represent their countries are some of the best, chosen from thousands of students who participate enthusiastically in their own National Geography Olympiads. iGeo tests the abilities of every participants in spatial patterns and processes. The iGeo consists of three parts: a written test, a multimedia test and a substantial fieldwork exercise requiring observation, leading to cartographic representation and geographical analysis. The programme also includes poster presentations by teams, cultural exchanges, and time for students to get to know their fellow students and explore the host city.

The International Geography Olympiad is organised by the [[International Geographical Union]] (IGU) Olympiad Task Force, who produce tests with reference to the local organisers and the international board.

After the first iGeo in 1996, it was recommended that the competition was held biennially. Due to the competition growing in popularity, since 2012 the competition has been held annually, rather than biennially, as is the case with the other large [[International Science Olympiad]]s.

== History of competition and national success ==

During the 1994 Congress of the International Geographical Union (IGU) in [[Prague]], people from [[Poland]] and the [[Netherlands]] launched the idea of an International Geography Competition (iGeo) or Olympiad for students between 15 and 19 years of age. The first one was held in 1996 in [[The Hague]], Netherlands, with five participating countries. The participant count grew to 24 countries with the 2008 competition in [[Carthage]], [[Tunisia]].

Before 2012, the International Science Olympiads were held every two years, and some regional geography Olympiads were held during intervening years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.geoolympiad.org/fass/geoolympiad/what-is-igeo/index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; These include the Asia Pacific Regional Geography Olympiads (APRGO), which were held in 2007 (Hsinchu, Taiwan&lt;ref&gt;http://promotinggeog.geo.ntnu.edu.tw/iGeo2010taipei/introduction.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://spock.nehs.hc.edu.tw/newsletter/1205/B.htm&lt;/ref&gt;), 2009 (Tsukuba, Japan&lt;ref&gt;http://japan-igeo.com/english/pdf/result.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and 2011 (Merida, Mexico&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gtansw.org.au/files/geog_bulletin/2012/2_GTA%20Bulletin%201%202012-2_Asia%20Pacific%20Olympiad.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the Central European Regional Geography Olympiads (CERIGEO). Since 2013, the International Geography Olympiad, in concordance with the other Olympiads, has been held on a yearly basis.

At the most recent iGeo, held in [[Quebec City]], [[Canada]] between July and August 2018, there were 43 participating countries.

The next Olympiad is the 2019 iGeo, which will be held in [[Hong Kong]], China in August 2019.

The '''''International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders''''' is a [[Peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[healthcare journal|medical journal]] that covers topics relevant to speech and language [[communication disorder|disorders]] and speech and language therapy. Article types published are research reports, reviews, discussions, and clinical fora. It is the official journal of the [[Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists]]. The journal is published by [[Wiley-Blackwell]] and [[Editor-in-chief|edited]] by Dr Steven Bloch and Dr Cristina McKean. The journal was established in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1460-6984/homepage/ProductInformation.html|title=About the journal |publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |work=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a 2016 [[impact factor]] of 2.195.&lt;ref name=WoS&gt;{{cite book |year=2012 |chapter=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders |title=2011 [[Journal Citation Reports]] |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |edition=Science  |series=[[Web of Science]] |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journal is available online and is published 6 times a year.

The movie ''[[The King's Speech]]'' has caused much awareness about [[stuttering]]. In response to this, a virtual issue of the journal was produced on the theme of ''The King's Speech'' and stuttering research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/10.1111/(ISSN)1460-6984/homepage/the_king_s_speech_virtual_issue.htm|title=The King's Speech and Stuttering Research|publisher=[[Wiley-Blackwell]] |work=International Journal of Language &amp; Communication Disorders }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">The '''javelin argument''', credited to [[Lucretius]], is an ancient [[logical argument]] that the [[universe]], or [[cosmology|cosmological]] [[space]], must be infinite: 

:As to space, I need but ask you, how can that be bounded? For whatever bounds, it that thing must itself be bounded likewise; and to this bounding thing there must be a bound again, and so on for ever and ever throughout all immensity. Suppose, however, for a moment, all existing space to be bounded, and that a man runs forward to the uttermost borders, and stands upon the last verge of things, and then hurls forward a winged javelin,&amp;mdash; suppose you that the dart, when hurled by the vivid force, shall take its way to the point the darter aimed at, or that something will take its stand in the path of its flight, and arrest it? For one or other of these things must happen. There is a dilemma here that you never can escape from.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=GyQgAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA86 Google Books result]: [[William Hurrell Mallock|W. H. Mallock]], ''[[Lucretius]]''. John B. Alden:New York, 1883. p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

This argument was used to support the [[Epicurean]] thesis about the universe.

However, the argument assumes incorrectly that a finite universe must necessarily have a "limit" or edge. The argument fails in the case that [[shape of the universe|the universe might be shaped]] like the surface of a [[hypersphere]] or [[torus]]. (Consider a similar fallacious argument that the Earth's surface must be infinite in area: because otherwise one could go to the Earth's edge and throw a javelin, proving that the Earth's surface continued wherever the javelin hit the ground.)

The '''McMaster Nuclear Reactor''' (MNR) is a 5[[MWe#Watts electrical and thermal|MW&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;]] [[pool-type reactor]] located on the campus of [[McMaster University]], in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], Canada.

==Description==
MNR began operating in April 1959, as the first [[university]] based [[research reactor]] in the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], and remains the highest-flux reactor in a university environment in [[Canada]] to this day{{when|date=February 2014}}.  The reactor consists of two connected pools; the core can be located and operated in either one. This allows the core to be moved away from experimental apparatus for maintenance.  MNR is an example of a reactor where the core is visible while the reactor is operating. The core itself appears to be glowing blue when looked at from the surface, as a result of the [[Cherenkov radiation]].

MNR is the only research reactor in Canada with a full containment structure. The reactor is fuelled with low-[[enriched uranium|enrichment uranium]] and cooled and moderated with light water.  Heat is transported to the atmosphere through the secondary coolant system via two [[cooling tower]]s adjacent to the reactor building.

The reactor is used for a variety of purposes: undergraduate education involves NAA ([[Neutron Activation Analysis]]), reactor physics experiments and [[radioisotope]]s for tracers and counting experiments. Graduate studies use neutron beams for [[neutron]] [[radiography]], neutron diffraction, prompt gamma NAA and geochronological techniques. Commercial activities include [[radioisotope]] production and [[neutron]] [[radiography]]. The facilities also include a [[Hot Cell]] and high-activity [[cobalt]] source and high level radioisotope laboratories. Researchers using MNR are based at McMaster as well as other universities in Canada and around the world.

The MNR also produces half of Canada's production of [[iodine-125]], while [[Chalk River Laboratories]], produces the other half. During the [[National Research Universal Reactor#2009 Shutdown|2009 shutdown]] of the Chalk River, however, the university increased production of iodine-125 by 20% and offered to retrofit the MNR to handle the production of [[molybdenum-99]]. The MNR had previously handled the production of molybdenum in the 1970s when the Chalk River facilities underwent a vessel replacement.&lt;ref&gt;

==Alleged links to terrorism and lawsuit==
[[Paul L. Williams (author)|Paul L. Williams]], an American author, has published books which claim that McMaster University in general and the nuclear reactor specifically have been infiltrated by terrorist groups, who have managed to steal {{convert|82|kg}} of unspecified [[nuclear material]].

The University strenuously denies these claims, and in 2007 was in the process of suing Williams for upwards of $2 million.  The [[Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission]], which regulates all radioactive material in Canada, have released a letter stating that "We can confirm that there has never been a report of any nuclear material that has been lost or stolen from McMaster's reactor".&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11621">'''Memory work''' is a process of engaging with the past which has both an [[ethical]] and [[historical]] dimension.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; [[Edgar Reitz|Edgar Reitz's]] ''[[Heimat (film series)|Heimat]]'' and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in ''Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject'', edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and memory==
The premise for memory work or ''travail de memoire'' is that history is not memory. We try to represent the past in the present through memory, history and the archives. As [[Paul Ricoeur]] argued, memory alone is fallible.&lt;ref&gt;(1955) Ricoeur, Paul. ''History and Truth''. Translated by C. A. Kelbley. Evanston: Northwestern University press. (2nd edition 1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Historical accounts are always partial and potentially misrepresent since historians do not work with bare, uninterpreted facts.  [[Historian]]s construct and use archives that contain traces of the past. However, historians and [[librarian]]s determine which traces are preserved and stored. This is an interpretive activity. Historians pose questions to which the archives responds leading them to “facts that can be asserted in singular, discrete propositions that usually include dates, places, proper names, and verbs of action or condition”.&lt;ref&gt;(2000) Ricoeur, Paul. La Mémoire, l'Histoire, l'Oubli: l'ordre philosophique: Éditions du Seuil, p.226&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals remember events and experiences some of which they share with a collective. Through mutual reconstruction and recounting collective memory is reconstructed. Individuals are born into familial discourse which already provides a backdrop of communal memories against which individual memories are shaped. A group's communal memory becomes its common knowledge which creates a social bond, a sense of belonging and identity. Professional historians attempt to corroborate, correct, or refute collective memory. Memory work then entails adding an ethical component which acknowledges the responsibility towards revisiting distorted histories thereby decreasing the risk of social exclusion and increasing the possibility of social cohesion of at-risk groups.

The concept of memory-work as distinguished from history-as-memory finds a textbook case in the Vichy Syndrome as described by Rousso.&lt;ref&gt;(1991) Rousso, Henry. ''The Vichy Syndrome: History and Memory in France since 1944''. Translated by A. Goldhammer. Cambridge/London: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; His title uses medical lexicon to refer to history-memory as dependent on working consciously with unconscious memories to revise accounts of history. This calls for an expanded archive that includes the "oral and popular tradition"&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's Heimat and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject, edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the written traditions normally associated with the archives.

==Pierre Nora on memory work==
[[Pierre Nora]], introduced 'lieu de mémoire' about 25 years ago, he traced the surge in memory work at the level of the nation-state to the revisiting of distorted histories of the [[anti-Semitic]] [[Vichy regime|Vichy France]] (1940-1944) following the death of [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;(2002) Nora, Pierre. "The Reasons for the Current Upsurge in Memory." Transit-Virtuelles Forum.22 Retrieved Access 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; Structural changes resulted from the end of the peasantry and the dramatic economic slump as oil prices worldwide rose in 1974. Added to this was the intellectual collapse of Marxism precipitated in part by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]]’s ''[[Gulag Archipelago]]'' which forced the French to rethink attitudes towards the past. 'Lieu de mémoire' closed down perspectives to better understand cultural memory, instead of opening up perspectives. He associated memory with place, and location.

During memory work, the process of producing an image or what we refer to as the production of the imaginary, is central. Therefore, the key in the analysis of remembered history are contradictions.&lt;ref&gt;*(2008), Haug, Frigga. "Australian Feminist Studies" in Memory Work. Volume 23, 537-541.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jacques Derrida on memory work==
After meeting at Yale University in 1966, Jacques Derrida was a colleague and friend of [[Paul de Man]]'s&lt;ref name="NYT1dec1987"&gt;{{cite news|title=Yale Scholar Wrote for Pro-Nazi Newspaper|publisher=New York Timesdate=1 December 1987|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1350&amp;dat=19871201&amp;id=QkNPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5wIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6723,1648630}}page 1&lt;/ref&gt; until de Man's death in 1983. In 1984 Derrida gave three lectures, including one at Yale University on the art of memory. In ''Memories:for Paul de Man'' {{harv|Derrida|1986}} described the relationship between memory work and deconstruction in this often-cited passage.

{{quote|"The very condition of a deconstruction may be at work in the work, within the system to be deconstructed. It may already be located there, already at work. Not at the center, but in an eccentric center, in a corner whose eccentricity assures the solid concentration of the system, participating in the construction of what it, at the same time, threatens to deconstruct. One might then be inclined to reach this conclusion: deconstruction is not an operation that supervenes afterwards, from the outside, one fine day. It is always already at work in the work. Since the destructive force of Deconstruction is always already contained within the very architecture of the work, all one would finally have to do to be able to deconstruct, given this always already, is to do memory work. Yet since I want neither to accept nor to reject a conclusion formulated in precisely these terms, let us leave this question suspended for the moment."{{harv|Derrida|1986|p=71}}&lt;ref name="Derrida1986"&gt;{{cite book|first=Jacques|last=Derrida|title=Memories:for Paul de Man|year=1986|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|pages=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Barbara Gabriel on memory work==
[[Barbara Gabriel]] provided a model for reading the complexities of memory and forgetting by situating ''[[wikt:unheimlich|unheimlich]]'' within the ''[[wikt:heimlich|heimlich]]'', in a [[Freudian]] 'one within the other structure'.&lt;ref&gt;(2004) Gabriel, Barbara. "The Unbearable Strangeness of Being; Edgar Reitz's ''Heimat'' and the Ethics of the Unheimlich" in ''Postmodernism and the Ethical Subject'', edited by B. Gabriel and S. Ilcan. Montreal &amp; Kingston: McGill-Queen's University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As point of departure Gabriel examined [[Edgar Reitz]]'s eleven-part West German television series entitled [[Heimat (film series)|''Heimat'']]. Reitz' work was in response to a larger movement in Germany national memory work provoked in part by an American television series entitled the ''Holocaust'' followed viewed by millions. As European art in general and German art in particular resurged in the 1960s, artists like [[Günter Grass]] and Edgar Reitz captured international attention as they grappled with issues of identity in a divided, post-Holocaust Germany. Gabriel developed  the concept of an impulse towards national memory work in Germany that stemmed from a haunted subject yearning for a lost, far away, nostalgic place, a utopic homeland. "How do we confront that which we have excluded in order to be, whether it is the return of the repressed or the return of the strangers?"&lt;ref&gt;(1982) Kristeva, Julia. ''Powers of Horror.'' New York: University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, that which we fear as 'other' is within ourselves through our shared humanity. Repressed memories haunt all of us.

==Artistic and Activist Memory Work==

After attending a memory methodology workshop in Cape Town, South Africa in 2005 on forced removal traumas, Australian performance artist Tanya Heyward, created a performance piece called ''Site'' in Melbourne Watch House in 2006. She referred to a burial ground at Prestwich Street, Cape Town, South Africa with three thousand skeletons dating back to Dutch colonization, the largest of its kind in the South Africa.&lt;ref name=activist_memory_work&gt;

==Post-colonial views==
The concept of memory work is part of a sociological imagination from a post-national point of view. Expanding on [[Norbert Loeffler]]: The idea of one national history is only acceptable as a question, not as an answer.

Memory work is related to identity work often associated with displaced persons. Some of the most provocative research on memory work has been authored by the [[Pied-noir]], or French colonials in Algeria, who returned to [[France]] following the [[Algerian War]]. Examples of such thinkers include [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Hélène Cixous]]. Another major writer in this field, [[Julia Kristeva]], also moved away from the country of her birth, having emigrated to France from Bulgaria when she was 24.

'''Institute of Mathematics of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]''' ({{lang-uk|Інститут математики Національної академії наук України}}) is a government-owned [[research institute]] in [[Ukraine]] that carries out basic research and trains highly qualified professionals in the field of mathematics. It was founded on 13 February 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imath.kiev.ua/institute/?cat=1&amp;lang=en |title=History of the Institute |language=Ukrainian |publisher=Institute of Mathematics |accessdate=29 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable research results==
The perturbation theory of toroidal invariant manifolds of dynamical systems was developed here by academician [[Nikolay Bogolyubov|M. M. Bogolyubov]], [[Yurii Mitropolskiy|Yu. O. Mitropolsky]], academician of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine|NAS of Ukraine]] and the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], and [[Anatoly Samoilenko|A. M. Samoilenko]], academician of the NAS of Ukraine. The theory's methods are used to investigate oscillation processes in broad classes of applied problems, in particular, the phenomena of passing through resonance and various bifurcations and synchronizations.

[[Sharkovskii's theorem|Sharkovsky’s order theorem]] was devised by its author while he worked for the Institute. It became the basis for the theory of one-dimensional dynamical systems that enabled the study of chaotic evolutions in deterministic systems, and, in particular, of ‘ideal turbulence’.

The school of the NAS academician [[Yurij Berezansky|Yu. M. Berezansky]] constructed the theory of generalized functions of infinitely many variables on the basis of spectral approach and operators of generalized translation.

The school of the NAS academician [[Anatoliy Skorokhod|A. V. Skorokhod]] investigated a broad range of problems related to random processes and stochastic differential equations.

Heuristic methods of phase lumping of complex systems were validated, important results in queuing theory and reliability theory were obtained, and a series of limit theorems for [[semi-Markov process]]es were proved by [[Volodymyr Korolyuk|V. S. Korolyuk]], academician of the NAS of Ukraine. He has also constructed the Poisson approximation for stochastic homogeneous additive functional with semi-Markov switching.

[[Udacity]]: [https://www.udacity.com/wiki/cs271/unit1_notes Introduction to Artificial Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a partially observable system would be a [[card game]] in which some of the cards are discarded into a pile face down.  In this case the observer is only able to view their own cards and potentially those of the dealer.  They are not able to view the face-down (used) cards, nor the cards which will be dealt at some stage in the future.  A memory system can be used to remember the previously dealt cards that are now on the used pile. This adds to the total sum of knowledge that the observer can use to make decisions.

In contrast, a fully observable system would be that of [[chess]].  In chess (apart from the 'who is moving next' state, and minor subtleties such as whether a side has castled, which may not be clear) the full state of the system is observable at any point in time.

Partially observable is a term used in a variety of mathematical settings, including that of Artificial Intelligence and [[Partially observable Markov decision process]]es.

'''Pop Culture Classroom''', based in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], is a nonprofit organization that educates in the areas of literacy and arts through alternative approaches to learning and character development. The organization creates educational programs for underserved youths, schools and communities by using comic books, graphic novels and related media to inspire passion for reading, art, and learning.

==Overview and history==
Pop Culture Classroom was founded in 2010 as Comic Book Classroom,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pow! Comic Book Classroom project takes on illiteracy in metro schools|url=http://www.denverpost.com/theater/ci_18562585 |publisher=Denver Post|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Colorado charitable organization focused on enhancing and improving student’s learning experience through the use of comic book media. At the same time, the founders of Comic Book Classroom also created the [[Denver Comic Con]] event. The Original Founders of Comic Book Classroom and Denver Comic Con are Charlie LaGreca, Frank Romero, David Vinson and Kevin Vinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://popcultureclassroom.org/about/history/|publisher=Pop Culture Classroom|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2010 and 2012, the Original Founders were joined by accomplished educators Illya Kowalchuk and Christina Angel, and experienced event organizers Michael Newman and Bruce Macintosh, who became an integral part of organizational development as the foundations of both Comic Book Classroom and Denver Comic Con educational programs were developed simultaneously.

The Classroom program debuted the first version of its “Storytelling Through Comics” curriculum to local area schools, and with the help of hundreds of dedicated volunteers and generous donations, the Denver Comic Con event became a reality on Father’s Day weekend, June 15, 2012. It was an unexpected and overwhelming success. The 2013 and 2014 Denver Comic Con’s built on that success.

Proceeds from Denver Comic Con fund the staffing, supplies and infrastructure of The Classroom program that promotes literacy through the medium of sequential art and storytelling. “Storytelling Through Comics” is a graphic literature creation program that is offered free of charge to schools, teachers and community organizations. The program currently offers students an educational experience that includes instruction in reading &amp; vocabulary, writing stories, and eventually the creation of the students’ own comics. Completed entries are then published in a class collection.

In 2014, the Comic Book Classroom Board of Directors voted to change the name to Pop Culture Classroom (PCC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Wrap-Up: Denver Comic Con 2014! (Part 1)|url=http://popcultureclassroom.org/the-classroom/education-wrap-up-denver-comic-con-2014-part-1/|publisher=Pop Culture Classroom|accessdate=2014-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name change reflects the board’s broader vision for the organization. In addition to expanding the reach of our comic-based curriculum, PCC seeks to use other elements of pop culture to advance our mission of literacy education and to spark the creative spirit within every child.

==Need==
The need for literacy education in Colorado inspired the CBC program. High percentages of elementary and middle school-aged children in Colorado do not have or cannot afford after-school care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Need For After-School |url= http://www.afterschoolallstars.org/programs/need-for-after-school/|publisher=After-School All Stars|website=Afterschoolallstars.org|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, several studies show that children who receive arts education often outperform children who do not in most educational areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Champions of Change: The Impact on the Art of Learning |url= http://artsedge.kennedy-center.org/champions/pdfs/ChampsReport.pdf |publisher=The Arts Education Partnership|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curriculum==
Pop Culture Classroom’s “Storytelling Through Comics” curriculum is designed to educate 11- to 14-year-old students (grades 5-8) about literacy and the arts. The common core curriculum enhances students’ writing and reading abilities and artistic skills through an interactive educational experience focused around comic books and graphic novels. It can be offered as an after-school course, a stand-alone unit, or as a complement to an existing language arts curriculum in a classroom.

The six-week program is broken out into a series of distinct lesson modules:

•	The Joy of Reading: Students learn the terms associated with the creation, design and reading of comics and gain an understanding of the enjoyment and personal fulfillment associated with the medium.&lt;br&gt;
•	Visual &amp; Textual Storytelling: Students learn about storytelling arcs and define exposition, event, rising action, crisis, falling action and conclusion. Participants begin drafting their own short comic strip using the storytelling arc as a template.&lt;br&gt;
•	Dialogue: Students are introduced to dialogue as a narrative device and begin scripting their stories.&lt;br&gt;
•	Analyzing Conflict Resolution through Dialogue and Using an Outline: Students learn how dialogue reveals conflict and resolution in comics and learn the technique of reverse outlining to pace their stories.&lt;br&gt;
•	Basic Drawing for Comics: Students learn basic drawing techniques from a guest artist.&lt;br&gt;
•	Creating Comics and the “Author’s Chair” Celebration: Students finish their comic story using techniques taught in previous modules and celebrate their achievement.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The CBC curriculum is designed to meet the needs of early and challenged readers as well as students in more advanced stages of literacy. The curriculum includes dialogue around text and image, discussion and use of vocabulary and terminology. 
The larger goals of the curriculum are to teach literacy and arts engagement while fostering identity growth, positive peer relationships, communication skills, and community development among young people.

==Benefits==
Each local graduate receives a customized one-day ticket for themselves and a caregiver to [[Denver Comic Con]]. At the convention, graduates are welcomed as guests of honor. Additionally, they are given the chance to work with industry professionals in the Comic Book Classroom Corral, sell sketches to attendees, and further their understanding that popular culture has a valuable place in society and represents a viable career path. Graduates also receive a graduate package that includes the Denver Comic Con pass as well as a graduation certificate, custom CBC pencil, button, and sketchpad.

In addition, [[Denver Comic Con]] offers free admission to 200 educators annually during its Educator’s Day on Friday.

==Programming==
Pop Culture Classroom’s programming includes:

'''In-schools programs'''
*Trained volunteers facilitate the program in local schools as an after-school program, a stand-alone unit or as a complement to existing language arts classes or programs.

'''Online Resources'''
*Pop Culture Classroom offers a variety of downloadable resources that parents and teachers can use to integrate sequential arts education into their own educational efforts or classroom programs.
*The CBC website offers “Rowrr Recommends” reviews of age-appropriate comic books and graphic literature for children and their parents.
Comic Book Classroom Kids’ Corral

The focal point of the annual [[Denver Comic Con]] is the Comic Book Classroom Kids’ Corral, which is designed to spotlight the CBC program, its students, and graduates. The 5000-square foot activity center provides educational youth-based programming and activities for younger attendees and families. In addition, many Denver Comic Con guests have donated their time and talents to working with students in the CBC Kids’ Corral.

Programming is conducted by volunteers, many of whom are trained arts educator or comic industry professionals. In addition to actively teaching in classrooms and after-school programs, volunteers provide administrative support, curriculum/assessment development, comic and literature reviews, outreach, website development, fundraising and event planning.

==Influence==
Since the first Pop Culture Classroom program was conducted at Force Elementary School (Denver Public Schools) in the spring of 2010, Pop Culture Classroom has impacted over 400 students in the Denver metro region. The organization has conducted programs at over a dozen elementary and middle schools in the Denver area as well as community organizations such as the Boys &amp; Girls Club of Metro Denver and the [[WOW! Children's Museum]] of Lafayette, Colorado.

==Support==
Supplementary support for CBC’s educational programming is provided by the [[Stan Lee Foundation]] and the national non-for-profit organization Generation Schools. In 2013, actor [[William Shatner]] appeared in the Pop Culture Classroom's "Corral" at [[Denver Comic Con]] to read [[Maurice Sendak]]'s children's book [[Where The Wild Things Are]] in support of Pop Culture Classroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Denver Comic Con 2013: Hey Kids, Come See William Shatner Read 'Where The Wild Things Are' |url= http://geek-news.mtv.com/2013/06/03/william-shatner-where-the-wild-things-are/ |publisher=MTV Geek|accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15778">'''Predictive maintenance''' ('''PdM''') techniques are designed to help determine the condition of in-service equipment in order to predict when maintenance should be performed. This approach promises cost savings over routine or time-based [[preventive maintenance]], because tasks are performed only when warranted. 

All downtime in production or processes needs to be minimize  or the productivity and the profitability will down crease. Maintenance is a key factor to solve these down times and the latest form in maintenance is to use big data to optimize and help maintenance to predict all the outcomes for the future and help companies to do maintenance before anything is broken and in advance and according to their own plan. &lt;ref&gt;C.K.M.Lee, Kam. K.M Ng, Yi  = Big Data Analytics for Predictive Mainte-nance Strategies. 
URL = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312004126_Big_Data_Analytics_for_Predictive_Maintenance_Strategies
accesdate = 6 November 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

The main promise of predictive maintenance is to allow convenient scheduling of [[corrective maintenance]], and to prevent unexpected equipment failures. The key is "the right information in the right time". By knowing which equipment needs maintenance, maintenance work can be better planned (spare parts, people, etc.) and what would have been "unplanned stops" are transformed to shorter and fewer "planned stops", thus increasing plant availability. Other potential advantages include increased equipment lifetime, increased plant safety, fewer accidents with negative impact on environment, and optimized spare parts handling.

Predictive maintenance differs from [[preventive maintenance]] because it relies on the actual condition of equipment, rather than average or expected life statistics, to predict when maintenance will be required.

Some of the main components that are necessary for implementing predictive maintenance are data collection and preprocessing, early fault detection, fault detection, time to failure prediction, maintenance scheduling and resource optimization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322900854_Fault_Class_Prediction_in_Unsupervised_Learning_using_Model-Based_Clustering_Approach?channel=doi&amp;linkId=5a74cec40f7e9b41dbce3114&amp;showFulltext=true|title=Fault Class Prediction in Unsupervised Learning using Model-Based Clustering Approach|last=Amruthnath|first=Nagdev|last2=Gupta|first2=Tarun|date=2018-02-02|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.22085.14563}}&lt;/ref&gt; Predictive maintenance has also been considered to be one of the driving forces for improving productivity and one of the ways to achieve "[[Just-in-time manufacturing|just-in-time]]" in manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/322869981_A_Research_Study_on_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning_Algorithms_for_Fault_Detection_in_Predictive_Maintenance?channel=doi&amp;linkId=5a738a1ca6fdcc53fe1474b5&amp;showFulltext=true|title=A Research Study on Unsupervised Machine Learning Algorithms for Fault Detection in Predictive Maintenance|last=Amruthnath|first=Nagdev|last2=Gupta|first2=Tarun|date=2018-02-01|doi=10.13140/rg.2.2.28822.24648}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Predictive maintenance evaluates the condition of equipment by performing periodic (offline) or continuous (online) equipment [[condition monitoring]]. The ultimate goal of the approach is to perform maintenance at a scheduled point in time when the maintenance activity is most cost-effective and before the equipment loses performance within a threshold. This results in a reduction in unplanned downtime costs because of failure where for instance costs can be in the hundreds of thousands per day depending on industry.&lt;Ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://learnoilanalysis.com/oil-analysis-saves-you-money-but-how-much/|title=How Much Does Predictive Maintenance Save You Money?|website=LearnOilAnalysis.com|access-date=2017-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In energy production in addition to loss of revenue and component costs, fines can be levied for non delivery increasing costs even further. This is in contrast to time- and/or operation count-based maintenance, where a piece of equipment gets maintained whether it needs it or not. Time-based maintenance is labor intensive, ineffective in identifying problems that develop between scheduled inspections, and so is not cost-effective.

The "predictive" component of predictive maintenance stems from the goal of predicting the future trend of the equipment's condition. This approach uses principles of statistical process control to determine at what point in the future maintenance activities will be appropriate.

Most predictive inspections are performed while equipment is in service, thereby minimizing disruption of normal system operations. Adoption of PdM can result in substantial cost savings and higher system reliability.

[[Reliability centered maintenance|Reliability-centered maintenance]] (RCM) emphasizes the use of predictive maintenance techniques in addition to traditional preventive measures. When properly implemented, RCM provides companies with a tool for achieving lowest asset net present costs (NPC) for a given level of performance and risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mather|first=D.|date=2008|title=The value of RCM|website=Plant Services|url=http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2008/177.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One goal is to transfer the PdM data to a [[computerized maintenance management system]] (CMMS) so that the equipment condition data is sent to the right equipment object in the CMMS system in order to trigger maintenance planning, work order execution, and reporting.&lt;ref name="PengEquip12"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9uYSIH2eP_oC&amp;pg=PA132 |title=Equipment Management in the Post-Maintenance Era: A New Alternative to Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) |author=Peng, K. |publisher=CRC Press |pages=132–136 |year=2012 |isbn=9781466501942 |accessdate=18 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unless this is achieved, the PdM solution is of limited value, at least if the PdM solution is implemented on a medium to large size plant with tens of thousands pieces of equipment. In 2010, the mining company Boliden, as a first, implemented a combined [[Distributed Control System]] (DCS) and PdM solution integrated with the plant CMMS system on an object to object level, transferring equipment data using protocols like [[Highway Addressable Remote Transducer Protocol]] (HART), [[IEC61850]] and [[OLE for process control]] (OPC).

==Technologies==

To evaluate equipment condition, predictive maintenance utilizes [[nondestructive testing]] technologies such as [[infrared]], acoustic (partial discharge and airborne ultrasonic), corona detection, [[vibration analysis]], sound level measurements, [[oil analysis]], and other specific online tests. A new approach in this area is to utilize measurements on the actual equipment in combination with measurement of process performance, measured by other devices, to trigger equipment maintenance. This is primarily available in collaborative process automation systems (CPAS).  Site measurements are often supported by [[wireless sensor networks]] to reduce the wiring cost.

Vibration analysis is most productive on high-speed rotating equipment and can be the most expensive component of a PdM program to get up and running. Vibration analysis, when properly done, allows the user to evaluate the condition of equipment and avoid failures. The latest generation of vibration analyzers comprises more capabilities and automated functions than its predecessors. Many units display the full vibration spectrum of three axes simultaneously, providing a snapshot of what is going on with a particular machine. But despite such capabilities, not even the most sophisticated equipment successfully predicts developing problems unless the operator understands and applies the basics of vibration analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Yung, C. (2006) "Vibration analysis: what does it mean?" ''Plant Services'' [http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2006/154.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Remote visual inspection is the first non destructive testing. It provides a cost-efficient primary assessment. Essential information and defaults can be deduced from the external appearance of the piece, such as folds, breaks, cracks and corrosion.The remote visual inspection has to be carried out in good conditions with a sufficient lighting (350 LUX at least). When the part of the piece to be controlled is not directly accessible, an instrument made of mirrors and lenses called endoscope is used. Hidden defects with external irregularities may indicate a more serious defect inside.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

Acoustical analysis can be done on a sonic or [[Ultrasound|ultrasonic]] level. New ultrasonic techniques for condition monitoring make it possible to "hear" friction and stress in rotating machinery, which can predict deterioration earlier than conventional techniques.&lt;ref name="PlantServices"&gt;Kennedy, S. (2006) "New tools for PdM" ''Plant Services''. [http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2006/072.html] Learn about condition monitoring beyond oil analysis, temperature and vibration in Sheila Kennedy's monthly Technology Toolbox column.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultrasonic technology is sensitive to high-frequency sounds that are inaudible to the human ear and distinguishes them from lower-frequency sounds and mechanical vibration. Machine friction and stress waves produce distinctive sounds in the upper ultrasonic range.
Changes in these friction and stress waves can suggest deteriorating conditions much earlier than technologies such as vibration or oil analysis. With proper ultrasonic measurement and analysis, it’s possible to differentiate normal wear from abnormal wear, physical damage, imbalance conditions, and lubrication problems based on a direct relationship between asset and operating conditions.

Sonic monitoring equipment is less expensive, but it also has fewer uses than ultrasonic technologies. Sonic technology is useful only on mechanical equipment, while ultrasonic equipment can detect electrical problems and is more flexible and reliable in detecting mechanical problems.

Infrared monitoring and analysis has the widest range of application (from high- to low-speed equipment), and it can be effective for spotting both mechanical and electrical failures; some consider it to currently be the most cost-effective technology. 
Oil analysis is a long-term program that, where relevant, can eventually be more predictive than any of the other technologies. It can take years for a plant's oil program to reach this level of sophistication and effectiveness. 
Analytical techniques performed on oil samples can be classified in two categories: used oil analysis and wear particle analysis. Used oil analysis determines the condition of the lubricant itself, determines the quality of the lubricant, and checks its suitability for continued use. Wear particle analysis determines the mechanical condition of machine components that are lubricated. Through wear particle analysis, you can identify the composition of the solid material present and evaluate particle type, size, concentration, distribution, and morphology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plantservices.com/articles/2006/212.html  Robin, L. (2006) "Slick tricks in oil analysis" ''Plant Services'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of '''Model Based Condition Monitoring''' for predictive maintenance programs is becoming increasingly popular over time.  This method involves spectral analysis on the motor’s current and voltage signals and then compares the measured parameters to a known and learned model of the motor to diagnose various electrical and mechanical anomalies.  This process of "model based" condition monitoring was originally designed and used on NASA’s space shuttle to monitor and detect developing faults in the space shuttle’s main engine.&lt;ref&gt;A. Duyar and W. C. Merrill, "Fault Diagnosis for the Space Shuttle Main Engine", AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control and Dynamics, vol. 15, no. 2, pp. 384-389, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  It allows for the automation of data collection and analysis tasks, providing round the clock condition monitoring and warnings about faults as they develop.

'''Psychosociology''' or '''psycho-sociology''' is the study of problems common to [[psychology]] and [[sociology]], particularly the way individual behavior is influenced by the groups the person belongs to.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/psychosociology Psychosociology], [[Merriam-Webster]]&lt;/ref&gt;
For example, in the study of [[criminals]], ''psychology'' studies the personality of the criminal shaped by the criminal's upbringing.  ''Sociology'' studies the behavior of the entire group itself: the methods the criminal group uses to recruits members and the way the group changes over time. ''Psychosociology'' studies the criminal's behavior, which is created by the group they belong to, such as the young people living in the same neighborhood block.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mon.univ-montp2.fr/claroline/backends/download.php?url=L1BQVF9XSEFUX0lTX1BTWUNIT1NPQ0lPTE9HWS5wcHQ%3D&amp;cidReset=true&amp;cidReq=DUGCIPSYSOCI. What is Psychosociology], Espace Pédagogique Claroline Université montpellier 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many social factors that can affect the psychology of others. An example of this is social [[cliques]]. Whether one gets accepted into their desired clique or not, it changes the way they think of themselves, and the people around them. Friendships at young ages while growing up also have much to do with not only psychological development, but [[social skills]] and [[social behavior]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thomas J|first1=Berndt|title=The Features and Effects of Friendship in Early Adolescence|jstor=1130071|publisher=Wiley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same goes for common laws in society. Whether an individual's group decides to obey by them or not, it affects that individual's outlook on the law and their group as a whole. The way people may act or speak dictates the way others see them in a society. For example, individuals can see authority in many different ways depending on their experiences and what others have told them. Because of this, based on people's social knowledge of authority, their opinions and ideas are very different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Diesing|first1=Paul|title=How Does Social Science Work?|jstor=j.ctt5hjpmm.13|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Every individual has their own unique and personal psychological thought process in which they use to analyze the world around them. People internalize and process sociological factors in ways relative to their psychological thought process. This relationship is reciprocated with one another as society can alter and morph the ways that people think while at the same time, society can be influenced by the externalized psychological thinking of the individuals within the society itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bandura|first=Albert|date=2001-08-01|title=Social Cognitive Theory of Mass Communication|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03|journal=Media Psychology|volume=3|issue=3|pages=265–299|doi=10.1207/S1532785XMEP0303_03|issn=1521-3269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, one could see how psychology is instrumental in helping the sociologist to view the wide spread effects of social facts within an individuals behavior.

'''Secondary notation''' is the set of [[sensory cue|visual cues]] used to improve the readability of a [[formal notation]]. Examples of secondary notation include the [[syntax highlighting]] of computer [[source code]], sizes and [[color code]]s for easy recognition of [[consumer symbol]]s such as [[bank note]]s or [[coin]]s, or the regular typographic conventions often found in [[technical book]]s to highlight sections with the same type of content.

Secondary notation provides redundant (more than necessary) information; if the visual cues are the only way that some information is provided, such as in [[traffic light]]s, or a [[Legend (chart)|chart's key]], it is not secondary. Secondary notation is often not a part of the formal notation itself. Rather, it is a method of organizing the formal notation to allow it to be more easily understood. Thus, secondary notation does not change the actual meaning of the formal notation, rather it allows for the meaning to be readily understood. In text such as [[Programming language|programming languages]], this can be done using cues such as [[Indent style|indentation]] and [[Color code|coloring]]. In formal graphical notations, this can be done through the use of symmetry or proximity to indicate relatedness.

==In different contexts==

Secondary notation annotates formal notation in a number of contexts which can be broken down to two main domains: text and graphics.

===Textual context===

There are a number of common instances of secondary notation that are seen in text. Secondary notation is common in [[typography]] and in [[code editor]]s appearing as boldness, italics, and spacing/indentation.

====Textual secondary notation in computer source code====

Secondary notation in the form of coloring and indentation is commonly implemented in [[integrated development environment]]s to make source code more readable and make the formal notation more understandable. The following [[C (programming language)|C source code]] does not use secondary notation to ease the interpretation of the formal notation:

&lt;code&gt;
int main(){while(true){printf("I'm stuck in an infinite loop!");}}
&lt;/code&gt;

The following is the same code, but with indentation and [[syntax highlight]]ing. As a result, the formal notation of C is easier to read:

&lt;source lang="c"&gt;
int main()
{
    while (true) {
        printf("I'm stuck in an infinite loop!");
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

====Textual secondary notation in typography====

A number of examples of secondary notation that commonly appear in English writing include

* '''[[Emphasis (typography)#Font styles and variants|Boldness]]''' which is used to put emphasis on a certain area of text.
* ''[[Italic type|Italics]]'' which is another method of applying emphasis on a certain area of text.
* The following example effectively uses [[Indentation (typesetting)|indentation]] to separate items on a shopping list that must be bought at different stores. Indented items all must be bought at the store within which the items are nested.

&lt;source lang="md"&gt;
 1. Allison's Frozen Foods 
     - Frozen Tuna
     - Chicken patties
     - Fish sticks
     - 2lb of hamburgers
  
 2. Sarah's Groceries
     - 3 boxes of cereal
     - 2 boxes of fruit juice
     - 2 dozen eggs 
  
 3. Jim's Formal Wear
     - 2 dress shirts
     - 1 orange tie
&lt;/source&gt;

===Graphical context===
Secondary notation is commonly used in graphical contexts to better convey information beyond what the formal notation of the graphic makes explicit.

==== Flowcharts ====
[[File:Well drawn process model (vertically oriented).png|thumb|This is a well drawn model of the steps a user would take to place an order for some products on a website.]]
[[File:Poorly drawn process model of ordering from a website.png|thumb|This is a poorly drawn model of the steps a user would take to place an order for some products on a website.]]
A graphical representation that has been well studied and can be heavily impacted by secondary notation is a [[flowchart]] and especially [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]]. Research has shown that there are a number of layout factors unincorporated into the formal notation that impact a flowchart's ease of understanding:
# '''Minimize arc crossings:''' the number of times lines cross should be kept to a minimum to ease traceability. In [[DRAKON|drakon-charts]] all the arc (line) crossings  are forbidden.
# '''Minimize line bends:''' additional bends add to the visual complexity of the model
# '''Leverage symmetry:''' position elements symmetrically when possible
# '''Align labels horizontally:''' textual labels are easier to read when aligned horizontally
# '''Use of locality:''' group related items together to be easily recognizable

The examples on the right show how these techniques can drastically affect the ease of understanding when looking at a process model. The model depicts a simplified process for ordering products from a website. Both diagrams contain exactly the same blocks with the same interconnections. However, the one that uses better secondary notation can be readily understood whereas the other model requires careful analysis to understand its contents.

==== Misuse ====
While inadequate use of secondary notation can significantly increase the amount of effort necessary to understand a model, misuse of secondary notation can also be a detriment. Use of symmetry can make a graphic more visually appealing, but can also convey misconceptions if used incorrectly. For instance, placing unrelated items close together may cause a reader to perceive them as being related. Additionally, arbitrary use of coloring may distract a reader as they wonder about the meanings of the various colors.

==Experts vs. novices==
The ability of individuals to understand and use secondary notation has been shown{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} to vary based on experience within the relevant field. Experts in a field are generally more able to utilize the clues provided by secondary notation. Specifically, while reading diagrams, experts have been shown to have more skill at reading the larger structure of the diagram and using it to guide their examination of the details provided by the formal notation. This compares to novices who often focusing on the details of the formal notation and ignoring the hints provided by the secondary notation.

There are also differences based on level of experience/expertise when creating documents that utilize secondary notation. Experts tend to be more consistent in their use of conventions while novices tend to vary between conventions, sometimes adhering on a surface level, but failing to convey the desired information. In the case of circuit diagrams, this is illustrated by common novice mistakes such as creating visual symmetry where there is no logical symmetry and frequent transitions between differing secondary notation conventions.

== As part of formal notation ==
In some cases, secondary notation is part of the formal notation. Such formal notations attempt to improve readability by enforcing the presence of visual cues. The trade-off is that, what in many other cases is only secondary notation (like, for example, indentation in [[free-form language]]s), is now part of the formal notation, and thus is not optional.

For example, the [[Python (programming language)|Python]] programming language requires source code to follow strict indentation rules. This is intended to improve readability of the code, by ensuring that statements that are at the same level of nesting within a block are aligned to the same column. Other types of secondary notation, however, are not part of the formal notation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk|title=Python:  Myths about Indentation|website=www.secnetix.de|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when wrapping long lines, every line that is a continuation of a previous line can be indented arbitrarily.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/|title=PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code|website=www.python.org|language=en|access-date=2017-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;source lang="python"&gt;
if x == 1:
    print "x is 1"
    print "x is odd"
print "This is always printed"
    # this is illegal
    print "Hello world"
str = " ".join (
    "these words are indented",
    "for better readability")
&lt;/source&gt;

[[Markdown]] also uses indentation as part of the formal syntax of the language. Indentation is required in Markdown when creating certain source code representations of [[block quotation]]s as well as when creating sections of source code to be rendered as the code itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax|title = Markdown Syntax|date = 2015-04-19|accessdate = 2015-04-19|website = Daring Fireball|publisher = |last = Gruber|first = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MUSTARD.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Segmented regression|SegReg]] program: yield of mustard ([[colza]]) and soil salinity]]
'''Soil salinity control''' relates to controlling the problem of soil salinity and reclaiming salinized agricultural land.

The aim of soil salinity control is to prevent [[soil degradation]] by [[salination]] and [[land reclamation|reclaim]] already salty (saline) soils. Soil reclamation is also called soil improvement, rehabilitation, remediation, recuperation, or amelioration.

The primary man-made cause of [[Soil salinity|salinization]] is [[irrigation]]. [[river|River water]] or [[groundwater]] used in irrigation contains salts, which remain behind in the soil after the water has [[evaporation|evaporated]].

The primary method of controlling soil salinity is to permit 10-20% of the irrigation water to [[Leaching model|leach]] the soil,that will be drained and discharged through an appropriate [[Drainage system (agriculture)|drainage system]]. The salt concentration of the [[Watertable control|drainage water]] is normally 5 to 10 times higher than that of the irrigation water, thus salt export matches salt import and it will not accumulate.

==The soil salinity problem==

[[soil salinity|Salty (saline) soils]] are [[soil]]s that have a high [[salt]] content.  The predominant salt is normally [[sodium chloride]] (NaCl, "table salt"). [[Saline soils]] are therefore also ''sodic soils'' but there may be sodic soils that are not saline, but [[alkaline soils|alkaline]].

{{quotebox|title=World Soil Salt Degradation|This damage is an average of 2,000 hectares of irrigated land in arid and semi-arid areas daily for more than 20 years across 75 countries (each week the world loses an area larger than Manhattan)...To feed the world's anticipated nine billion people by 2050, and with little new productive land available, it's a case of all lands needed on deck.&amp;mdash;''principal author Manzoor Qadir, Assistant Director, Water and Human Development, at UN University's Canadian-based Institute for Water, Environment and Health''&lt;ref name="physorg102014"&gt;http://phys.org/news/2014-10-world-hectares-farm-soil-daily.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
}}
{{clear}}

According to a study by UN University, about {{convert|62|e6ha|e3sqmi e6acre|abbr=none}}, representing 20% of the world's irrigated lands are affected, up from {{convert|45|e6ha|e3sqmi e6acre|abbr=unit}} in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name="physorg102014"/&gt;  In the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]], home to over 10% of the world's population, crop yield losses for [[wheat]], [[rice]], [[sugarcane]] and [[cotton]] grown on salt-affected lands could be 40%, 45%, 48%, and 63%, respectively.&lt;ref name="physorg102014"/&gt;

Salty soils are a common feature and an [[Environmental impact of irrigation|environmental problem]] in [[irrigated land]]s in [[arid]] and [[semi-arid]] regions, resulting in poor or little crop production.&lt;ref&gt;I.P. Abrol, J.S.P Yadav, and F. Massoud 1988. Salt affected soils and their management, Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Soils Bulletin 39.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The problems are often associated with high [[water table]]s, caused by a lack of natural [[subsurface drainage]] to the underground. Poor subsurface drainage may be caused by insufficient transport capacity of the [[aquifer]] or because water cannot exit the aquifer, for instance if the aquifer is situated in a [[topographical]] depression.

Worldwide, the major factor in the development of saline soils is a lack of precipitation.  Most naturally saline soils are found in [[arid|(semi)arid regions]] and [[semi arid|climates]] of the earth.

===Primary cause===
[[File:Soil Salinity2.jpg|thumb|250px|Irrigated saline land with poor crop stand]]
The primary cause of man-made salinization is the salt brought in with irrigation water. All irrigation water derived from rivers or groundwater, however 'sweet', contains salts that remain behind in the soil after the water has evaporated.

For example, assuming irrigation water with a low salt concentration of 0.3 g/l (equal to 0.3&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ corresponding to an electric conductivity of about 0.5 FdS/m) and a modest annual supply of irrigation water of 10,000 m³/ha (almost 3&amp;nbsp;mm/day) brings 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg salt/ha each year. In the absence of sufficient natural drainage (as in waterlogged soils) and without a proper leaching and [[drainage]] program to remove salts, this would lead to a high soil salinity and reduced [[crop yield]]s in the long run.

Much of the water used in irrigation has a higher salt content than in this example, which is compounded by the fact that many irrigation projects use a far greater annual supply of water. [[Sugar cane]], for example, needs about 20,000 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/ha of water per year. As a result, irrigated areas often receive more than 3,000&amp;nbsp;kg/ha of salt per year and some receive as much as 10,000&amp;nbsp;kg/ha/year.

===Secondary cause===
The secondary cause of salinization is [[Waterlogging (agriculture)|waterlogging]] in irrigated land. Irrigation causes changes to the natural [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] of irrigated lands. Large quantities of water in irrigation projects are not consumed by plants and must go somewhere. In irrigation projects it is impossible to achieve 100% irrigation efficiency where all the irrigation water is consumed by the plants. The maximum attainable irrigation efficiency is about 70% but usually it is less than 60%. This means that minimum 30%, but usually more than 40% of the irrigation water is not evaporated and it must go somewhere.

Most of the water lost this way is stored underground which can change the original [[geohydrology|hydrology]] of [[aquifer|local aquifers]] considerably. Many aquifers cannot absorb and transport these quantities of water and so the [[water table]] rises leading to water logging.

Waterlogging causes three problems: 
* The shallow water table and lack of [[Oxygenation (environmental)|oxygenation]] of the root zone reduces the yield of most crops
* It leads to an accumulation of salts brought in with the irrigation water as their removal through the aquifer is blocked
* With the upward [[seepage]] of [[groundwater]] more salts are brought into the soil and the salination is aggravated

Aquifer conditions in irrigated land and the groundwater flow have an important role in soil salinization,&lt;ref name="Balances"&gt;ILRI, 2003.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Salt affected area===
Normally, the salinization of agricultural land affects a considerable area of irrigation projects, on the order of 20 to 30%. When the agriculture in such a fraction of the land is abandoned, a new salt and [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] is attained, a new equilibrium is reached, and the situation becomes stable.

In India alone, thousands of square kilometres have been severely salinized. China and Pakistan do not lag much behind (perhaps China has even more salt affected land than India). A regional distribution of the 3,230,000&amp;nbsp;km² of saline land worldwide is shown in the following table derived from the FAO/UNESCO Soil Map of the World.&lt;ref&gt;R.Brinkman, 1980.

[[File:GOHANA2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[CumFreq]] program: spatial variation of soil salinity]]

===Spatial variation===
Although the principles of the processes of salinization are fairly easy to understand, it is more difficult to explain why certain parts of the land suffer from the problems and other parts do not, or to [[predict]] accurately which part of the land will fall victim. The main reason for this is the variation of natural conditions in time and space, the usually uneven distribution of the irrigation water, and the seasonal or yearly changes of [[agricultural practices]]. Only in lands with undulating [[topography]] is the prediction simple: the depressional areas will degrade the most.

The preparation of salt and water balances&lt;ref name="Balances" /&gt; for distinguishable sub-areas in the [[irrigation]] project, or the use of agro-hydro-salinity models,&lt;ref name="Snellen"&gt;[http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/toolsalt.pdf SaltMod: ''a tool for interweaving of irrigation and drainage for salinity control'']. In: W.B.Snellen (ed.), Towards integration of irrigation, and drainage management. ILRI Special report, p. 41-43. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt; can be helpful in explaining or predicting the extent and severity of the problems.

==Diagnosis==
[[File:maize egypt.png|thumb|250px|The maize crop (corn) in Egypt has a salt tolerance of ECe=5.5 dS/m beyond which the yield declines &lt;ref&gt; H.J. Nijland and S. El Guindy, ''Crop yields, watertable depth and soil salinity in the Nile Delta, Egypt''. In: Annual report 1983. International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:rice egypt.png|thumb|250px|The rice crop in Egypt has a similar salt tolerance as maize. &lt;ref&gt; On line collection of salt tolerance data of agricultural crops from measurements in farmers' fields [https://www.waterlog.info/croptol.htm] &lt;/ref&gt; ]]

===Measurement===
Soil salinity is measured as the salt [[concentration]] of the soil [[solution]] in tems of g/l or [[electric conductivity]] (EC) in [[Siemens (unit)|dS/m]]. The relation  between these two units is about 5/3 : y g/l =&gt; 5y/3 dS/m. [[Seawater]] may have a salt concentration of 30 g/l (3%) and an EC of 50 dS/m.

The standard for the determination of soil salinity is from an extract of a saturated paste of the soil, and the EC is then written as ECe. The extract is obtained by [[centrifugation]]. The salinity can more easily be measured, without centrifugation, in a 2:1 or 5:1 water:soil mixture (in terms of g water per g dry soil) than from a saturated paste. The relation between ECe and EC&lt;sub&gt;2:1&lt;/sub&gt; is about 4, hence : ECe&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;4&amp;nbsp;EC&lt;sub&gt;1:2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2003, ''This paper discusses soil salinity''. Lecture notes, International Course on Land Drainage International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/salinity.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Classification===
Soils are considered saline when the ECe &gt; 4.&lt;ref&gt;L.A.Richards (Ed.), 1954. Diagnosis and improvement of saline and alkali soils. USDA Agricultural Handbook 60. [http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=10158&amp;page=2 On internet]&lt;/ref&gt; When 4 &lt; ECe &lt; 8, the soil is called slightly saline, when 8 &lt; ECe &lt; 16 it is called (moderately) saline, and when ECe&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;16 severely saline.

===Crop tolerance===
Sensitive crops lose their vigor already in slightly saline soils, most crops are negatively affected by (moderately) saline soils, and only salinity resistant crops thrive in severely saline soils. The University of Wyoming &lt;ref name="Alan"&gt;Alan D. Blaylock, 1994, ''Soil Salinity and Salt tolerance of Horticultural and Landscape Plants. [http://www.wyomingextension.org/agpubs/pubs/WY988.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Government of Alberta &lt;ref name="Albert"&gt;Government of Alberta, [http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3303 ''Salt tolerance of Plants'']&lt;/ref&gt; report data on the salt tolerance of plants.

==Principles of salinity control==
[[Drainage system (agriculture)|Drainage]] is the primary method of controlling soil salinity. The system should permit a small fraction of the irrigation water (about 10 to 20 percent, the drainage or leaching fraction) to be drained and discharged out of the irrigation project.
&lt;ref name="Hoorn"&gt;J.W. van Hoorn and J.G. van Alphen (2006), Salinity control. In: H.P. Ritzema (Ed.), Drainage Principles and Applications, p. 533-600, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In irrigated areas where salinity is stable, the salt concentration of the drainage water is normally 5 to 10 times higher than that of the irrigation water. Salt export matches salt import and salt will not accumulate.

When reclaiming already salinized soils, the salt concentration of the drainage water will initially be much higher than that of the irrigation water (for example 50 times higher). Salt export will greatly exceed salt import, so that with the same drainage fraction a rapid desalinization occurs. After one or two years, the soil salinity is decreased so much, that the salinity of the drainage water has come down to a normal value and a new, favorable, equilibrium is reached.

In regions with pronounced [[dry season|dry]] and [[wet season]]s, the drainage system may be operated in the wet season only, and closed during the dry season. This practice of checked or controlled drainage saves irrigation water.

The discharge of salty drainage water may pose ''environmental problems'' to downstream areas. The environmental hazards must be considered very carefully and, if necessary mitigating measures must be taken. If possible, the drainage must be limited to wet seasons only, when the salty effluent inflicts the least harm.

==Drainage systems==
[[File:DrainSection2.png|thumb|left|250px|Parameters of a horizontal drainage system]]
[[File:WellDrain2.png|thumb|right|250px|Parameters of a vertical drainage system]]
Land drainage for soil salinity control is usually by ''horizontal drainage system'' (figure left), but ''vertical systems'' (figure right) are also employed.

The drainage system designed to evacuate salty water also lowers the [[water table]]. To reduce the cost of the system, the lowering must be reduced to a minimum. The highest permissible level of the water table (or the shallowest permissible depth) depends on the irrigation and agricultural practices and kind of crops.

In many cases a seasonal average water table depth of 0.6 to 0.8 m is deep enough. This means that the water table may occasionally be less than 0.6 m (say 0.2 m just after an irrigation or a rain storm). This automatically implies that, in other occasions, the water table will be deeper than 0.8 m (say 1.2 m). The fluctuation of the water table helps in the breathing function of the soil while the expulsion of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) produced by the [[plant]] [[root]]s and the inhalation of fresh [[oxygen]] (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is promoted.

The establishing of a not too deep water table offers the additional advantage that excessive field irrigation is discouraged, as the crop yield would be negatively affected by the resulting elevated water table, and irrigation water may be saved.

The statements made above on the optimum depth of the water table are very general, because in some instances the required water table may be still shallower than indicated (for example in rice paddies), while in other instances it must be considerably deeper (for example in some [[orchard]]s). The establishment of the optimum depth of the water table is in the realm of [[Watertable control|agricultural drainage criteria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Agricultural Drainage Criteria'', Chapter 17 in: H.P.Ritzema (2006), Drainage Principles and Applications, Publication 16, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. {{ISBN|90-70754-33-9}}.

==Soil leaching==
[[File:SoilLeaching2.jpg|thumb|250px|Water balance factors in the soil]]
The [[vadose zone]] of the [[soil]] below the soil surface and the [[watertable]] is subject to four main [[hydrology|hydrological]] inflow and outflow factors:&lt;ref name="Balances" /&gt;
*[[Infiltration (hydrology)|Infiltration]] of rain and [[irrigation]] water (Irr) into the soil through the soil surface (Inf) :
*Inf = Rain + Irr
*[[Evaporation]] of soil water through plants and directly into the air through the soil surface (Evap)
*[[Percolation]] of water from the unsaturated zone soil into the groundwater through the watertable (Perc)
*[[Capillary rise]] of [[groundwater]] moving by capillary suction forces into the unsaturated zone(Cap)
In [[steady state]] (i.e. the amount of water stored in the unsaturated zone does not change in the long run) the [[Hydrology (agriculture)|water balance]] of the unsaturated zone reads: Inflow = Outflow, thus:
*Inf + Cap = Evap + Perc &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; or :
*Irr + Rain + Cap = Evap + Perc
and the ''salt balance'' is
*Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc = Evap.Fc.Ce + Perc.Cp + Ss
where Ci is the salt [[concentration]] of the irrigation water, Cc is the salt concentration of the capillary rise, equal to the salt concentration of the upper part of the groundwater body, Fc is the fraction of the total evaporation transpired by plants, Ce is the salt concentration of the water taken up by the plant roots, Cp is the salt concentration of the percolation water, and Ss is the increase of salt storage in the unsaturated soil. This assumes that the rainfall contains no salts. Only along the coast this may not be true. Further it is assumed that no [[Surface runoff|runoff]] or surface drainage occurs.&lt;br&gt;
The amount of  removed by plants (Evap.Fc.Ce) is usually negligibly small: Evap.Fc.Ce = 0
[[File:SALTMOD4.JPG|thumb|250px|Leaching curves, calibrating leaching efficiency]]
The salt concentration Cp can be taken as a part of the salt concentration of the soil in the unsaturated zone (Cu) giving: Cp=Le.Cu, where Le is the [[Leaching model|leaching efficiency]]. The leaching efficiency is often in the order of 0.7 to 0.8,&lt;ref&gt;R.J.Oosterbaan and M.A.Senna, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict drainage and salinity control in the Nile delta. In: Annual Report 1989, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands, p. 63-74. See ''Case Study Egypt'' in the SaltMod manual : [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/saltmod.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; but in poorly [[soil structure|structured]], heavy [[clay]] soils it may be less. In the Leziria Grande polder in the delta of the Tagus river in Portugal it was found that the leaching efficiency was only 0.15.&lt;ref&gt;E.A. Vanegas Chacon, 1990. Using SaltMod to predict desalinization in the Leziria Grande Polder, Portugal. Thesis. Wageningen Agricultural University, The Netherlands&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Assuming that one wishes to avoid the soil salinity to increase and maintain the soil salinity Cu at a desired level Cd we have: &lt;br&gt;
Ss = 0, Cu = Cd and Cp = Le.Cd. Hence the salt balance can be simplified to:
*Perc.Le.Cd = Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc
Setting the amount percolation water required to fulfill this salt balance equal to Lr (the ''leaching requirement'')
it is found that:
*Lr = (Irr.Ci + Cap.Cc) / Le.Cd .
Substituting herein Irr = Evap + Perc &amp;minus; Rain &amp;minus; Cap and re-arranging gives :
*Lr = [ (Evap&amp;minus;Rain).Ci + Cap(Cc&amp;minus;Ci) ] / (Le.Cd &amp;minus; Ci) &lt;ref name="Hoorn" /&gt;
With this the irrigation and drainage requirements for salinity control can be computed too.&lt;br&gt;
In irrigation projects in [[arid|(semi)arid zones]] and [[semi arid|climates]] it is important to check the leaching requirement, whereby the ''field irrigation efficiency'' (indicating the fraction of irrigation water percolating to the underground) is to be taken into account.&lt;br&gt;
The desired soil salinity level Cd depends on the crop tolerance to salt. The [[University of Wyoming]],&lt;ref name="Alan"/&gt; USA, and the [[Government of Alberta]],&lt;ref name= "Albert" /&gt; Canada, report crop tolerance data.

==Strip cropping: an alternative==
[[File:StripCropping.jpg|thumb|250px|Hydrological principles of ''strip cropping'' to control the depth of the water table and the soil salinity]]
In irrigated lands with scarce water resources suffering from drainage (high water table) and soil salinity problems, [[strip cropping]] is sometimes practiced with strips of land where every other strip is irrigated while the strips in between are left permanently [[fallow]].&lt;ref&gt;ILRI, 2000.  ''Irrigation, groundwater, drainage and soil salinity control in the alluvial fan of Garmsar''. Consultancy assignment to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations, International Institute for Land Reclamation and Improvement (ILRI), Wageningen, The Netherlands. On line: [http://www.waterlog.info/pdf/garmsar.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to the water application in the irrigated strips they have a higher [[watertable]] which induces [[Groundwater|flow of groundwater]] to the unirrigated strips. This flow functions as subsurface drainage for the irrigated strips, whereby the water table is maintained at a not-too-shallow depth, [[Leaching (agriculture)|leaching]] of the soil is possible, and the soil salinity can be controlled at an acceptably low level.

In the unirrigated (sacrificial) strips the soil is dry and the groundwater comes up by [[capillary rise]] and evaporates leaving the salts behind, so that here the soil salinizes. Nevertheless, they can have some use for [[livestock]], sowing salinity resistant [[grasses]] or [[weed]]s. Moreover, useful salt resistant trees can be planted like [[Casuarina]], [[Eucalyptus]] or [[Atriplex]], keeping in mind that the trees have deep rooting systems and the salinity of the wet subsoil is less than of the topsoil. In these ways [[wind erosion]] can be controlled. The unirrigated strips can also be used for [[salt]] harvesting.

==Soil salinity models==
{{Expand section|date=October 2007}}
[[File:File-Saltmod8 (2).JPG|thumb|250px|SaltMod components]]
The majority of the computer models available for water and solute transport in the soil (e.g. SWAP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swap.alterra.nl/ SWAP model]&lt;/ref&gt; DrainMod-S,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod/models.html DrainMod-S model] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081025223837/http://www.bae.ncsu.edu/soil_water/drainmod/models.html |date=2008-10-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UnSatChem,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ars.usda.gov/Services/docs.htm?docid=8966 UnSatChem model]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hydrus (software)|Hydrus]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pc-progress.com/en/default.aspx?hydrus-3d Hydrus model]&lt;/ref&gt; ) are based on Richard's [[differential equation]] for the movement of water in unsaturated soil in combination with Fick's differential [[convection–diffusion equation]] for [[advection]] and [[Fick's laws of diffusion|dispersion]] of salts.

The models require input of soil characteristics like the relations between variable unsaturated [[soil moisture]] content, water tension, [[water retention curve]], unsaturated [[hydraulic conductivity]], dispersivity and [[Mass diffusivity|diffusivity]]. These relations vary to a great extent from place to place and from time to time and are not easy to measure. Further, the models are difficult to [[calibration|calibrate]] under farmer's field conditions because the soil salinity here is spatially very variable. The models use short time steps and need at least a daily, if not an hourly, data base of [[hydrology|hydrological]] phenomena. Altogether this makes model application to a fairly large [[project]] the job of a team of specialists with ample facilities.

Simpler models, like [[SaltMod]],&lt;ref name="Snellen" /&gt; based on monthly or seasonal water and soil balances and an empirical capillary rise function, are also available. They are useful for long-term salinity predictions in relation to [[irrigation]] and [[drainage]] practices.

LeachMod,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waterlog.info/leachmod.htm LeachMod]&lt;/ref&gt; using the SaltMod principles, helps in analyzing leaching experiments in which the soil salinity was monitored in various root zone layers while the model will optimize the value of the leaching efficiency of each layer so that a fit is obtained of observed with simulated soil salinity values.

Spatial variations owing to variations in [[topography]] can be simulated and predicted using salinity cum [[groundwater model]]s, like [[SahysMod]].

The '''taxonomy of Liliaceae''' has had a complex history since the first description of this [[flowering plant]] [[family (biology)|family]] in the mid-eighteenth century. Originally, the [[Liliaceae]] or Lily family were defined as having a "[[Calyx (flower)|''calix'']]" (perianth) of six equal-coloured parts, six [[stamens]], a single [[Style (botany)|style]], and a superior, three-chambered (trilocular) [[Ovary (botany)|ovary]] turning into a [[Capsule (botany)|capsule]] fruit at maturity. The [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the Liliaceae family progressively expanded until it became the largest plant family and also extremely diverse, being somewhat arbitrarily defined as all [[species]] of plants with six [[tepals]] and a superior ovary. It eventually came to encompass about 300 [[genus (biology)|genera]] and 4,500 [[species]], and was thus a "[[Catch-all taxon|catch-all]]"  and hence [[paraphyletic]] [[taxon]]. Only since the more modern taxonomic systems developed by the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG) and based on [[phylogenetic]] principles, has it been possible to identify the many separate taxonomic groupings within the original family and redistribute them, leaving a relatively small core as the modern Liliaceae family, with fifteen genera and 600 species.

The Liliaceae emerged from the [[Liliales]] [[Order (biology)|order]], separating from its [[sister clade]] around 52&amp;nbsp;million years ago ([[mya (unit)|mya]]), and [[Genetic divergence|diversifying]] around 34&amp;nbsp;mya. Of the major [[clades]], the [[Lilieae]] arose in [[Eurasia]] while the [[Medeoleae]] arose in [[North America]]  but was subsequently dispersed, as may have the [[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]]. Liliaceae [[fossils]] have been dated to the [[Paleogene]] and [[Cretaceous]] eras in the [[Antarctic]].

The Liliaceae probably arose as shade plants, with subsequent evolution to open areas including [[deciduous forest]] in the more open autumnal period. This was accompanied by a shift from [[rhizomes]] to [[bulbs]], to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves.

While the suprageneric (above genus level) structure of the family has varied greatly with its ever-changing [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]], as currently constituted the family consists of three [[subfamily|subfamilies]], [[Lilioideae]], [[Calochortoideae]] and [[Streptopoideae]]. [[Lilioideae]] is further divided into two [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]], [[Medeoleae]] and [[Lilieae]]. The three subfamilies contain fifteen genera and approximately 600 species in all.

== History ==

=== Pre-Darwinian ===
The [[type genus]], ''[[Lilium]]'', from which the name of the family was derived, was originally formally described by Carl [[Linnaeus]] in 1753, with seven species.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/314/mode/1up Lilium vol.&amp;nbsp;i p.&amp;nbsp;302]}} He placed ''Lilium'' within the ''Hexandria Monogynia'' (six [[stamens]], one [[carpel]]) in his [[Linnaean taxonomy|sexual classification]] in the ''[[Species Plantarum]]''.{{sfn|Linnaeus|1753|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/358106#page/297/mode/1up Hexandria monogynia vol.&amp;nbsp;i pp.&amp;nbsp; 285–352]}} The Liliaceae [[family (biology)|family]] was first described by [[Michel Adanson]] in 1763,{{sfn|Lobstein|2013}}{{sfn|Adanson|1763|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/6958#page/588/mode/1up VIII Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;42–60]}} but formally named by [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu]] in 1789.{{sfn|Jussieu|1789|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/7125#page/143/mode/1up Lilia pp.&amp;nbsp;48–49]}}{{sfn|Stevens|2013}} Adanson described eight subfamilies with 78 genera, however the subfamily he described as ''Lis'' (Lilies) had seven genera (''Uvularia'', ''[[Erythronium|Mithridatium]]'', ''[[Gloriosa (plant)|Mendoni]]'', ''Lilium'', ''Fritillaria'', ''Imperialis'' — now part of ''Fritillaria'' — and ''Tulipa'') of which four are in the modern genus.{{sfn|Adanson|1763|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/6958#page/594/mode/1up Liliaceae Section II Les Lis ''Lilia''  p.&amp;nbsp;48]}} Jussieu placed these into the ''Ordo'', ''Lilia'' in the ''Classis'', ''Stamina Perigyna'' of the [[Monocots|''Monocotyledones'']] (monocots), with eight genera (''Tulipa'', ''Erythronioum'', ''[[Gloriosa (plant)|Methonica]]'', ''[[Uvularia]]'', ''[[Fritillaria]]'', ''Imperialis'', ''Lilium'', ''[[Yucca]]'') only four of which remain in the family. He defined ''Lilia'' as "[[Calyx (flower)|calix]]" ([[perianth]]) of six equal coloured parts, six stamens, a superior ovary, single style, and trilocular capsule. The term ''Ordo'' at that time was closer to what we now understand as Family, rather than [[Order (biology)|Order]].{{sfn|ICN|2012|loc=[http://www.iapt-taxon.org/nomen/main.php?page=art18 18.2 Names of families and subfamilies, tribes and subtribes]}}{{sfn|Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/204/mode/1up Des familles et des tribus pp.&amp;nbsp;192–195]}} Although Jussieu used the [[Latin]] "''Lilia''" in his ''Genera Plantarum'', elsewhere he used the French "''Liliacées''",{{sfn|de Jussieu|1778|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/89076#page/388/mode/1up p.&amp;nbsp;228]}} as had Adanson. The word "Liliaceae" was soon widely used by botanists such as [[Samuel Frederick Gray]],{{sfn|Gray|1821|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95185#page/185/mode/1up Fam IX Liliaceae Jussieu.  vol 2: p.&amp;nbsp;173]}} [[John Lindley]],{{sfn|Lindley|1830|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31944#page/347/mode/1up CCLI: Liliaceae. p.&amp;nbsp;279]}} and [[Pierre-Joseph Redouté]]{{sfn|Redouté|1802–1816}} in the early nineteenth century.

Gray (1821) provided the first description of Jussieu's scheme in English, identifying two genera occurring in Britain (''Tulipa'', ''Fritillaria''), distinguished by the absence or presence of basal nectaries. His key used the presence of six equal stamens, a single style, a simple [[petaloid]] (undifferentiated [[tepals]] resembling petals) perianth and a trilocular capsule with flat seeds to identify the family.{{sfn|Gray|1821|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95185#page/10/mode/1up An Arrangement of the Families, and of the anomalous Genera of phenogamous Plants, according to their sexual Organs. vol 2: p.&amp;nbsp;vi]}} Although [[Augustin De Candolle]] (1813) had not explicitly described the Liliaceae, his overall [[de Candolle system|classification scheme]] influenced many later writers including Gray.{{sfn|Gray|1821|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/95186#page/26/mode/1up The genera of British plants, according to their mutual relations, with the number of species in each genus. 2. Plantae Endogenae: B Plantae Endogenae Phenogamae - 14. Liliaceae. vol 1: p.&amp;nbsp;xx]}} In this scheme, {{sfn|Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/231/mode/1up Esquisse. D'une Série linéaire et par conséquent artificielle, pour la disposition des familles naturelles du règne végetal p.&amp;nbsp;219]}} the Liliaceae were considered a family within those [[vascular plants]] (''Vasculares'') whose vascular bundles were thought to arise from within (''Endogènes'', [[endogenous]]), a term he preferred to ''Monocotylédonés''. Jussieu's ''Monocotyledones'' became the ''[[Phanerogams|Phanérogames]]'' (''Phenogamae'' in Gray), meaning "visible seed", hence ''Endogenæ phanerogamæ''.{{sfn| Marilaun|1890–1891}} Candolle also instituted the concept of [[Taxonomic rank|ordered ranks]], based on classes, subclasses, ''familles'' (Latin: ''ordines naturales'') and ''tribus'' ([[Tribe (biology)|tribes]]),{{sfn| Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/204/mode/1up Des familles et des tribus pp.&amp;nbsp;192–195]}} subdividing the Liliaceae.

Lindley was the first post-Linnaean English [[systematist]], publishing his work in 1830,{{sfn|Lindley|1830}} and following the reasoning of Jussieu he used the term tribe to describe the Liliaceae as a division of the [[Petaloid monocots|hexapetaloid monocots]], characterised by a superior ovary, highly developed perianth, inward turning anthers, a trilocular polyspermous capsule and seeds with a soft spongy coat. He offered seven genera as examples (''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Lilium]]'', ''[[Calochortus]]'', ''[[Blandfordia]]'', ''[[Polianthes]]'', ''[[Hemerocallis]]'' and ''[[Funkia]]''). By 1846, in his final work, he refined and greatly expanded his taxonomy, favouring the term ''Alliances of Endogens'' over monocots as a class, of which there were eleven. Of these "alliances", the [[Liliales]] consisted of four Orders (families) including Liliaceae, which he referred to as ''lilyworts'' in the vernacular, with 133 genera and 1200 species.{{sfn|Lindley|1846|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/32198#page/274/mode/1up Order LXII: Liliaceae - Lilyworts. pp.&amp;nbsp;200–205]}} In this work he unhappily acknowledged the confusing array of different approaches to the classification of the Liliaceae, the lack of a clear definition, and the great diversity in the [[circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the order, which had expanded vastly, with many subdivisions. As he saw it, the Liliaceae had already become a ("[[Catch-all taxon|catch-all]]") grouping,{{sfn|Kubitzki|Rudall|Chase|1998}} being "everything that does not belong to the other parts of the Lilial Alliance", but expressed hope that the future would reveal some characteristic that would group them better.{{sfn|Lindley|1846|loc=p&amp;nbsp;.201}} In other words, he foresaw that Liliaceae would come to be regarded as [[paraphyletic]]. By the time of the next major British classification, that of [[Bentham and Hooker]] in 1883 (published in Latin) several of Lindley's other families had been absorbed into the Liliaceae.{{sfn|Bentham|Hooker|1862–1883|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/14690#page/309/mode/1up Vol III Part II Liliaceae pp. 748–836]}} This was the last major classification using the "natural" or pre-evolutionary approach to classification, based on characteristics selected ''[[a posteriori]]'' in order to group together taxa that have the greatest number of shared characteristics. This approach, also referred to as polythetic was superseded by ones based on an understanding of the acquisition of characteristics through evolution, referred to as [[phyletic]].{{sfn|Stuessy|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b9Q2EOkw7toC&amp;pg=PA47 Natural classification p.&amp;nbsp;47]}}{{sfn|Datta|1988|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=X7lfMACvjs4C&amp;pg=PA21 Systems of classification p.&amp;nbsp;21]}}{{sfn|Stace|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA19 The development of plant taxonomy p.&amp;nbsp;17]}}

[[File:Wettstein Fritillaria ophioglossifolia.jpg|thumb|''[[Fritillaria ophioglossifolia]]'', [[R Wettstein]] ''Handbuch der Systematischen Botanik'' 1901–1924]]Although [[Charles Darwin]]'s [[Origin of Species]] (1859) preceded Bentham and Hooker's publication, the latter project was commenced much earlier and [[George Bentham]] was initially sceptical of [[Darwinism]].{{sfn|Stuessy|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=b9Q2EOkw7toC&amp;pg=PA47 Natural classification p.&amp;nbsp;47]}} The new [[phyletic]] approach changed the way that taxonomists considered plant classification, incorporating [[evolutionary]] information into their schemata, but this did little to further define the circumscription of Liliaceae.{{sfn|Singh|2004|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=In_Lv8iMt24C&amp;pg=10 Historical background of plant classification. pp.&amp;nbsp;10–29]}} The major works in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century employing this approach were in the [[German language|German]] literature, the [[Eichler system|Eichler]] (1875–1886), [[Engler system|Engler and Prantl]] (1886–1924) and [[Wettstein system|Wettstein]] (1901–1935) systems. These placed the Liliaceae into one of the major subdivisions of the [[monocotyledons]], the [[Liliiflorae]].{{sfn|Eichler|1886|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=XE0bAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 Liliiflorae p.&amp;nbsp;34]}}{{sfn|Engler|1900–1968}}{{sfn|Engler|1903|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/63778#page/127/mode/1up Liliiflorae p.&amp;nbsp;93]}}{{sfn|Carter|1913}}{{sfn|Wettstein|1924|loc=[http://biolib.mpipz.mpg.de/wettstein/botanik/high/IMG_5926.html Liliiflorae p.&amp;nbsp;862]}} In the English literature, [[Bessey system|Charles Bessey]] (1915)  followed [[Adolf Engler]] in defining Liliaceae as "Pistil mostly 3-celled;  stamens 6; perianth of two similar whorls, each of three similar leaves", although placing the Liliales in a novel subclass of monocots, the [[Strobiloideae]],{{sfn|Bessey|1915}} while from [[Hutchinson system|John Hutchinson]] (1959) onwards the Liliaceae were treated as part of the [[Liliales]] (see [[#Tab1|Table 1]]).

Over time the Liliaceae became increasingly broadly, and somewhat arbitrarily, defined as all species of plants with six tepals and a superior ovary. They eventually came to encompass about 300 genera and 4,500 species, within the [[Order (biology)|order]] [[Liliales]] in the [[Cronquist system|scheme]] of [[Arthur Cronquist]] (1981).{{sfn|Cronquist|1981}} Cronquist was a "[[Lumpers and splitters|lumper]]" preferring a small number of very large groupings and his classification of the Liliaceae represented the greatest expansion of the family to date. Cronquist placed most flowering [[petaloid monocots]] with six stamens in this very broad (and clearly [[polyphyletic]]) family, hence the alternative name lilioid monocots.{{sfn|Rasmussen|1985}} He rejected the importance of ovary position and thus included with the Liliaceae with their superior ovary ([[hypogynous]]), the [[Amaryllidaceae]], some species of which had an inferior ovary (epigynous), and which others separated into a distinct family.{{sfn|Lawrence|1951}}{{sfn|Judd et al.|2007}}{{sfn|Thorne|1992}} The Liliaceae were one of the major families in the Cronquist system which included 22 families in addition to Liliaceae in the more restricted sense (''[[sensu stricto]]'', ''s.s.'') used by others.{{sfn|Reveal|1997}}{{sfn|Datta|1988}} Later more conventional schemes include the [[Thorne system (1992)|system]] of [[Robert F. Thorne]]{{sfn|Thorne|1992}} and that of [[Armen Takhtajan]]{{sfn|Takhtajan|1980}} which characterised the family as [[petaloid]] monocots, characterised by showy flowers with tepals and without [[starch]] in the [[endosperm]].

=== Deconstructing Liliaceae ===

Other botanists in the twentieth century echoed Lindley's concerns about the lack of a clearly defined grouping for Liliaceae. The earliest of these was [[Johannes Paulus Lotsy]] (1911),{{sfn|Lotsy|1907–1911|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/68460#page/721/mode/1up 3: Cormophyta Siphonogamia. Liliifloren p.&amp;nbsp;715]}} building on Wettstein's work. Lotsy suggested four separate families, Liliaceae, Alliaceae, Agapanthaceae and Gilliesiaceae, within the ''Liliifloren''. This recognised the major groupings that would later be transferred to [[Amaryllidaceae]] as subfamilies [[Allioideae]] and [[Agapanthoideae]], with [[Gilliesieae]] as a tribe within the Allioideae. This approach was later followed by [[Herbert Huber (botanist)|Herbert Huber]] in 1969.{{sfn|Huber|1969}} These various proposals to separate small groups of genera into more homogeneous families made little impact until [[Dahlgren system|Rolf Dahlgren]] (1985), following Huber's lead,{{sfn|Meerow|2002}} developed a system incorporating new information, including [[synapomorphy|synapomorphic characters]] (i.e., shared characters believed to have evolved from a common ancestor).{{sfn|Rasmussen|1985}} While Cronquist was a "lumper", Dahlgren was a "[[Lumpers and splitters|splitter]]", preferring a larger number of more homogeneous groupings. Where Cronquist saw one family, Dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders (predominantly [[Liliales]] and [[Asparagales]]), reducing Liliaceae to ten genera (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Walters|Keil|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=418 Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;418]}}{{sfn|Kelch|2002}} Over the 1980s, in the context of a more general review of the classification of [[angiosperms]], the Liliaceae were subjected to more intense scrutiny. By the end of that decade, the [[Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew]], the [[British Museum of Natural History]] and the [[Edinburgh Botanical Gardens]] formed a committee to examine the possibility of separating the family into smaller taxa, at least for the purpose of organizing their [[herbaria]]. That committee finally recommended that 24 new families be created in the place of the original broad Liliaceae, largely by elevating subfamilies to the rank of separate families.{{sfn|Datta|1988}}{{sfn|Mathew|1989}}

The 1990s saw considerable progress in plant [[phylogenetics]] and [[cladistic]] theory, enabling a [[phylogenetic tree]] to be constructed for the flowering plants.{{sfn|Chase et al|1993}} The establishment of major new [[clades]] necessitated a departure from the older but widely used classifications such as Cronquist and Thorne, based largely on morphology rather than genetic data. These developments complicated discussions on plant evolution and necessitated a major taxonomic restructuring.{{sfn|Utech|2003}}{{sfn|APG III|2009}} ''[[rbcL]]'' gene sequencing and cladistic analysis of monocots in 1995 had redefined the Liliales [[Order (biology)|order]]{{sfn|Chase et al.| 1995a}} out of four original morphological orders ''[[sensu]]'' [[Rolf Dahlgren|Dahlgren]]. The largest clade within this redefined Liliales, christened the "core Liliales" representing a now much reduced Liliaceae, had all previously been included in the Liliales, and included three taxonomic groups: (i) Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren,{{sfn|Rasmussen|1985|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=3iGndTFY0skC&amp;pg=PA233 Liliaceae pp.233–238]}} but also both the (ii) [[Calochortaceae]] as defined by [[MN Tamura|Minoro Tamura]] (''[[sensu]]'' Tamura){{sfn|Tamura|1998b}} and (iii) ''Clintonia-Medeola'' which had been included in Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura{{sfn|Tamura|1998b}} (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

This newly, more narrowly (''[[sensu stricto]]'', ''s.s.'') circumscribed Liliaceae, corresponded to the emerging circumscription of the family in the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] system (1998).{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} While this also corresponded most closely with Dahlgren's circumscription relative to the older much broader (''sensu lato'', ''s.l.'') constructions, it gave rise to some potentially confusing terminology. Compared to the very broad historical ''s.l.'' construction of Liliaceae, the Dahlgren, Tamura and APG constructions were much narrower. These have variously been referred to as "core Liliales" and ''sensu'' APG{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} for the broadest construction, while the intervening schemes of Tamura and [[Takhtajan]] (who was also a "splitter"){{sfn|APG|1998}} which are narrower have been referred to as Liliaceae ''s.s.'', ''sensu'' Dahlgren, and ''sensu'' Tamura. Of these the narrowest circumscription is that of Dahlgren, including only [[Lilieae]] ''s.l.''.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} In modern terminology, while "core Liliales" represents Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG, Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura corresponds to [[Lilioideae]] ''s.l.'', and ''sensu'' Dahlgren with [[Lilieae]] ''s.l.'' or Lilioideae ''s.s.''. [[Calochortoideae]] and [[Streptopoideae]] ''sensu APG'' represent  and [[Calochortaceae]] ''sensu'' Tamura, and ''Clintonia'' plus ''Medeola'' ([[Medeoleae]]) Medeoloideae ''sensu'' Tamura (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Stevens|2015|loc=[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APWeb/orders/Lilialesweb.htm#Liliaceae Liliaceae]}}

== Modern classification of Liliaceae ==

To meet the need for a thorough revision of the taxonomy of the flowering plants ([[angiosperms]]), [[systematist]]s formed the [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Group]] (APG), resulting in a new classification published in 1998.{{sfn|APG|1998}} The scheme was largely based on the work of [[Kåre Bremer]] and colleagues at [[Uppsala University|Uppsala]] and [[University of Stockholm|Stockholm]] universities in the late 1970s,{{sfn|Bremer|Wanntorp|1978}}{{sfn|Bremer|Bremer|Thulin|1997}}{{sfn|Williams et al.|2010}} and became universally accessible on the internet in 1996.{{sfn|Bremer|Bremer|2005}}
It was an ordinal system, concentrating on orders rather than families, prioritising [[monophyly]], in which Liliales were recognised as one of ten monocot orders, containing nine families.{{sfn|APG|1998}}  However progress was rapid and the modern era of the taxonomy of the Liliaceae family comes from [[Walter S. Judd|Judd]] and colleagues{{sfn|Judd et al.|2007}} (2002), the [[APG II]] (2003{{sfn|APG II|2003}}) and [[APG III]] (2009{{sfn|APG III|2009}}{{sfn|Chase|Reveal|2009}}), while the Linear APG III assigned it the family number 61.{{sfn|LAPGIII|2009}} The original APG did not specifically address the issues of the [[polyphyly]] within Liliaceae, but APG II did so within the two closely morphologically related orders, Liliales and Asparagales{{sfn|Rudall et al.|2000}} recognising the continued common use of Liliaceae in the broad sense (''[[sensu lato]]'', ''s.l.'').

These studies of [[DNA]] and [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] data (particularly reproductive morphology) together with [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic analyses]], allowed the conclusion that the "[[lilioid monocot|petaloid monocots]]" do not belong to one botanical family but rather are distributed across two separate orders, the [[Asparagales]] and [[Liliales]]. The [[monophyly]] of these newly defined orders is supported by [[cladistic]] analysis based on morphology, [[18S rDNA]], the [[plastid]] [[gene]] ''rbcL'', and other DNA sequences.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2000}}{{sfn|Chase et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Davis et al.|2004}}{{sfn|Graham et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Hilu et al.|2003}}{{sfn|Pires et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Rudall et al.|1997a}}{{sfn|Källersjö et al.|1998}}{{sfn|Fay|2000}}{{sfn|Soltis et al.|2000}}{{sfn|Stevenson et al.|2000}}{{sfn|McPherson|Graham |2001}}{{sfn|Goldblatt|1995}}{{sfn|Stevenson|Loconte|1995}}{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Givnish et al.|2005}}{{sfn|Givnish et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Rønsted et al.|2005}}{{sfn|Zomlefer et al.|2001}}

These studies, together with other analyses within each of these two orders, allowed the redistribution of the original genera of Liliaceae ''s.l.'' into a variety of families across the Liliales and Asparagales, as illustrated in [[#Clad1|Cladogram 1]].{{sfn|Soltis et al.|2005}} This redistribution resulted in considerable changes both in the suprafamilial positioning of Liliaceae within the overall APG classification (as shown in Table 1 below), as well as the subfamilial structure (see [[#Suprageneric subdivisions|Suprageneric subdivisions]]).{{sfn|Reveal|2010}}

== Phylogeny ==

The synthesis of molecular data with [[cladistic analysis]] suggests eleven orders of [[monocotyledons]], one of fourteen [[clades]] of [[Angiosperms]], and forming a [[Evolutionary grade|grade]] with six other orders.{{sfn|Meerow|2012}} Sequencing of the ''[[rbcL]]'' and ''trnL-F'' [[chloroplast DNA|plastid genes]] revealed four main Liliales lineages:{{sfn|Rudall et al.|2000}}
# Liliaceae group: [[Liliaceae]] (including some former [[Uvulariaceae]] and [[Calochortaceae]]), [[Philesiaceae]] and [[Smilacaceae]];
# [[Campynemataceae]];
# Colchicaceae group (Colchicoid lilies): [[Colchicaceae]] (including ''Petermannia'' and ''Uvularia''), [[Alstroemeriaceae]] and ''Luzuriaga'';
# [[Melanthiaceae]] (including [[Trilliaceae]]).

The original Liliaceae family in the broad sense (''[[sensu lato]]'', ''s.l.''), which encompassed a large number of differing groups of genera, was highly [[polyphyletic]] (see [[#Clad|Cladogram 1]]). This led to botanists increasingly adopting a more narrow [[monophyletic]] concept, ''i.e.'' strict sense (''[[sensu stricto]]'', ''s.s.'') of the family based on [[molecular phylogenetic]] relationships, as expressed in the 2009 APG III system, rather than the older ''sensu lato'' one. Former members of the Liliaceae are now principally classified in different families and subfamilies of the Liliales and Asparagales as shown in the phylogeny represented in Cladogram I. Other families and orders containing former Liliaceae taxa are the [[Nartheciaceae]] ([[Dioscoreales]]), [[Tofieldiaceae]] ([[Alismatales]]), [[Tecophilaeaceae]] ([[Asparagales]]) and the former [[Uvulariaceae]]. The achlorophyllous (non-[[photosynthesising]])  [[Corsiaceae]] were added to Liliales by APG III in 2009.{{sfn|APG III|2009}}{{sfn|Meerow|2012}}

[[Sequencing]] of the ''[[rbcL]]'' and [[Maturase K|''matK'']] [[chloroplast DNA|chloroplast genes]] of ''Lilium'' and related genera{{sfn|Hayashi|Kawano|2000}} confirmed the [[Circumscription (taxonomy)|circumscription]] of the family in the ''sensu stricto'' usage of [[Minoru N. Tamura|Tamura]] (1998).{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} Chloroplast ''[[ndhF]]'' gene sequencing also supported Liliaceae monophyly, reuniting the Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura and Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura (see [[#tab2|Table 2]] &amp; [[#tab3|Table 3]] below).

The major [[Genetic divergence|diversification]] amongst the [[Angiosperms]] (flowering plants) can be dated to the end of the [[Early Cretaceous]] [[Period (geology)|period]] which stretched from 146 to 100 million years ago ([[Mya (unit)|mya]]).{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Bremer|2000}}{{sfn|Wikström|Savolainen|Chase|2001}} The development of a phylogenetic approach to taxonomy, starting with [[Charles Bessey]]'s ''[[Bessey system|The phylogenetic taxonomy of flowering plants]]'' (1915) suggested the Liliales formed some of the earliest [[monocots]],{{sfn|Bessey|1915}} with an estimated date of origin of 124&amp;nbsp;mya for the [[stem group|stem node]] (most recent common ancestor of the clade of interest and its [[sister clade]]) age{{sfn|Janssen|Bremer|2004}} and between 117&amp;nbsp;mya{{sfn|Janssen|Bremer|2004}} to 82&amp;nbsp;mya{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}} for the crown node (most recent common ancestor of the sampled species of the clade of interest) age. Molecular analysis suggests that the Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG ("core Liliales") were part of one of four early clades of Liliales, namely [[Campynemataceae]], [[Melanthiaceae]], [[Alstroemeriaceae]] + [[Luzuriagaceae]] + [[Colchicaceae]] and [[Smilacaceae]] + Liliaceae, dated to 68–65&amp;nbsp;mya (stem node) with the separation of the Smilaceae and Liliaceae [[sister clade]]s (crown node) occurring later at around 55–52&amp;nbsp;mya.{{efn|Janssen and Bremer (2004) have somewhat earlier dates of 91 and 80&amp;nbsp;mya respectively but consider these similar within methodological limits{{sfn|Janssen|Bremer|2004}}}}  [[Genetic divergence|divergence]] within the Liliaceae appeared at about 36–34&amp;nbsp;mya, within Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura ([[Lilioideae]] ''s.l.'') at 27&amp;nbsp;mya, Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren ([[Lilieae]] ''s.s.'' and [[Tulipeae]]) at 20&amp;nbsp;mya ([[Miocene]]).

Within the Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren there developed two main evolutionary subclades (see [[#Clad2|Cladogram II]] and [[#Tab3|Table 3]]). The first of these, characterised as the Lilieae s.s. (''Lilium, Fritillaria, Nomocharis), Cardiocrinum), Notholirion'') diverged around 12&amp;nbsp;mya. The second subclade was the Tulipeae (''Erythronium, Tulipa''), (''Gagea''). Divergence within ''[[Calochortus]]'' is dated to 7&amp;nbsp;mya. This places the emergence of the Liliaceae at approximately the last ([[Maastrichtian]] period) of the [[Late Cretaceous]] periods (72 to 66&amp;nbsp;mya) to early ([[Paleocene]]) [[Paleogene]] periods (66 to 23&amp;nbsp;mya), formerly the Cretaceous–[[Tertiary]] boundary, 65&amp;nbsp;mya.{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Leitch et al.|2007}}

The southern hemisphere intercontinental distributions of Liliales suggests a connection to [[Gondwana]], whose breakup into western (Africa, South America) and eastern (Australia, Antarctica, Madagascar, India) portions occurred at 180–150&amp;nbsp;mya, and the final separation of the western portion into Africa and South America at 80&amp;nbsp;mya coinciding with the emergence of the Liliales. Thus the immediate ancestor of the Liliales is likely to have existed during the period of interconnection of the African and South American-Antarctic-Australian portions of Late Cretaceous Gondwana. While the ancestral clade appears to have been distributed in both northern and southern hemispheres, Liliaceae ''per se'' is [[holarctic]], confined to the northern hemisphere with both Eurasian (including some North African representatives) and North American lineages. It is likely that they originated in North America but were able to expand to Eurasia ~30–40&amp;nbsp;mya via [[Beringia]] that connected the two during the Tertiary period. The presence of genera whIch are restricted to Eurasia suggests a [[vicariance]] (separation of populations by continental division) split between Medeoleae and Lilieae involving Eurasia and North America ([[#Clad2|Cladogram II]]).{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}

Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren arose in [[Eurasia]],{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Vinnersten|Bremer|2001}}{{sfn|Leitch et al.|2007}} while within Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren the [[Lilieae]] ''s.s.'' subclade arose in the [[Himalayas]] ([[Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau]]), with later [[Evolutionary radiation|radiation]] there in [[montane]] and alpine habitats. Species of ''Lilium'' and ''Fritillaria'' then dispersed into the rest of Eurasia and North America. The second subclade, the Tulipeae arose in [[East Asia]] with subsequent colonisation of North America by ''Erythronium'' and ''Lloydia''. On the other hand, ''Clintonia-Medeola'' ([[Medeoleae]]) may have appeared in North America but subsequently underwent intercontintental dispersal (although some evidence points to a Eurasian origin). The Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura ([[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]]) appears to have evolved in western North America, with subsequent colonisation of East Asia by ''Streptopus'' and the ancestral ''Tricyrtis''.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

Liliaceae probably arose as [[shade plants]] in closed shaded habitats, with subsequent evolution of Liliaceae ''sensu'' Dahlgren and ''Calochortus'' to open areas including [[deciduous forest]] in the more open autumnal period, but then a return of some species (e.g. ''Cardiocrinum''). This was accompanied by a shift from rhizomes to bulbs, to more showy flowers, the production of capsular fruit and narrower parallel-veined leaves. Again, some reversal to the broader reticulate-veined leaves occurred (e.g. ''Cardiocrinum'').{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} In addition such molecular studies show that share characteristics do not necessarily indicate descent from a common ancestor but rather may arise from adaptive [[Convergence (evolution)|convergence]] in similar habitats. {{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

The fossil record of Liliales is relatively poor,{{sfn|Wilkin|Mayo|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sEfKwaRHQj4C&amp;pg=PA43 p.&amp;nbsp;43]}} but Liliaceae [[fossils]] have been dated to the Paleogene{{sfn|Stilwell|Feldmann|2000|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;162}} and Cretaceous periods in the [[Antarctic]].{{sfn|Goin et al.|2012|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=D0jDXAWyylMC&amp;pg=PA58 West Antarctic Paleoflora p.&amp;nbsp;58]}}{{sfn|Sambamurty|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FrdidPp6HuAC&amp;pg=PA172 p.&amp;nbsp;172]}}{{sfn|Friis et al.|2011}}

== Characteristics ==
{{main|Liliaceae#Description}}

=== Liliaceae ===

The diversity of characteristics complicates description of Liliaceae morphology, and confused taxonomic classification for centuries. The diversity is also of considerable evolutionary significance (see [[#Evolution|Evolution]]).{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} The Liliaceae family are characterised as monocotyledonous, perennial, herbaceous, bulbous (or [[rhizomatous]] in the case of [[Medeoleae]]){{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} flowering plants with simple [[trichomes]] (root hairs) and contractile [[root]]s.{{sfn|Spichiger|Perret|2002}} The flowers may be [[inflorescence|arranged]] along the stem, developing from the base, or as a single flower at the tip of the stem, or as a cluster of flowers. They contain both male (androecium) and female (gynoecium) characteristics and are symmetric radially, but sometimes as a mirror image. Most flowers are large and colourful, except for Medeoleae. Both the petals and sepals are usually similar and appear as two concentric groups (whorls) of "petals", that are often striped or multi-coloured, and produce nectar at their bases. The stamens are usually in two groups of three (trimerous) and the pollen has a single groove (monosulcate). The ovary is superior, i.e. placed above the attachment of the other parts. There are three fused carpels (syncarpous) with one to three chambers ([[locule]]s), a single style and a three-lobed stigma. The embryo sac is of the ''Fritillaria'' type. The fruit is generally a wind-dispersed capsule, but occasionally a berry (Medeoleae) which is dispersed by animals. The leaves are generally simple and elongated with veins parallel to the edges, arranged singly and alternating on the stem, but may form a rosette at the base of the stem.

===Subclades===

(See [[#Tab3|Table 3]]). The ten genera (two genera of Table 3 are subsumed into other genera) of the [[Lilioideae]] subfamily are characterised by contractile [[bulb]]s and roots and a [[megagametophyte]] (embryo-sac) of the ''[[Fritillaria]]''-type with four [[megaspore]]s. Within the Lilioideae, the eight genera considered as Liliaceae by Dahlgren (''sensu'' Dahlgren), that is [[Lilieae]] ''s.l.'', are characterised by [[loculicidal]] [[Capsule (botany)|capsules]] and a basic chromosome number x=12. Within this clade, Lilieae ''s.s.'' are characterised by papillose [[tepals]] (with the exception of ''Fritillaria'') and numerous fleshy bulb-scales as well as a morphologically distinct karyotype with two long [[Centromere#metacentric|metacentric]] [[chromosomes]] and 10 [[telocentrics]] of medium length.{{sfn|Gao et al.|2012}} The two genera within Tulipeae are distinguished by pseudo-basifixed [[anthers]] and single bulb scales. The two genera of [[Medeoleae]] are distinguished by having rhizomes instead of bulbs and [[berries]] instead of capsules, and a very unusual form of vesicular-arbuscular [[mycorrhizae]].{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}

The five genera constituting the [[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]] subfamilies form another distinct group, previously characterised under the Calochortoideae alone. These have creeping [[rhizome]]s, styles divided at their apices, and an embryo-sac of the ''[[Polygonum]]''-type with a simple megaspore and triploid [[endosperm]]. At times, these genera were considered as a separate family (Calochortaceae; e.g. Tamura) or even placed in the more heterogeneous [[Uvulariaceae]] ''sensu'' Dahlgren. However most of the latter had low morphological similarity to the Liliaceae, and ''[[Uvularia]]'' and ''[[Disporum]]'' are now classified in the [[Colchicaceae]]. ''Disporum '' contained both Asian and North American species which had always been distinguishable. Following molecular analysis, the North American species were restored to the genus ''[[Prosartes]]'' and retained in Liliaceae, subfamily Streptopoideae, while the Asian species were moved to Colchicaceae.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Shinwari et al.|1994}}{{sfn|Simpson|2011}}

== Subdivisions ==

=== Suprageneric subdivisions ===

Due to the diversity of the originally broadly defined Liliaceae (''s.l.''), many attempts have been made to form supageneric classification systems, organizing the genera into [[subfamilies]], [[Tribe (biology)|tribes]], or other suprageneric taxa (taxonomic groupings between genus and family).{{sfn|Peruzzi|Leitch|Caparelli|2009}} By 1813, Candolle recognised five subdivisions which he called tribes (''[[Asparagaceae|Asparagées]]'', ''[[Trilliaceae|Trilliacées]]'', ''[[Asphodeloideae|Asphodelées]]'', ''[[Bromeliaceae|Bromeliées]]'', ''[[Tulipa]]cées''),{{sfn|Candolle|1813|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/88297#page/231/mode/1up Esquisse. D'une Série linéaire et par conséquent artificielle, pour la disposition des familles naturelles du règne végetal p.&amp;nbsp;219]}} all of which Jussieu had made separate families, with the exception of ''Tulipa'', which was a genus within the Liliaceae. By 1845, John Lindley observed that the family had become extremely diverse, ill-defined and unstable, not only by its overall circumscription, but also by its subdivisions. For the 133 genera he included, he described eleven ''suborders''.{{sfn|Lindley|1846|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/32198#page/274/mode/1up Order LXII: Liliaceae - Lilyworts. pp.&amp;nbsp;200–205]}} By the 1870s, as [[John Gilbert Baker|Baker]] describes in his revision of the family, the taxonomy of Liliaceae had become vast and complicated. His approach was to divide the family into eight tribes.{{sfn|Baker|1871}}{{sfn|Baker|1873}}

In 1879, a revision of the North American Liliaceae by [[Sereno Watson]] described sixteen tribes, of which the Lilieae correspond most closely to current concepts of the family,{{sfn|Watson|1879}} [[Bentham and Hooker]] described twenty tribes in 1883, and Engler and Prantl in their [[Engler system|extensive description]] of the Liliaceae in 1899 identified 31 tribes distributed over 11 subfamilies, with Tulipeae and Alieae representing the modern family.{{sfn|Engler|Prantl|1888|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/56456#page/672/mode/1up Engler Liliaceae pp.&amp;nbsp;10–91 ]}} In 1936, [[Franz Buxbaum]] undertook a major revision of the Liliaceae and among others described the subfamily [[Lilioideae]] with three tribes: [[Lloydieae]] (''[[Gagea]]'', ''[[Lloydia]]'' and ''Szechenya'' and ''Giradiella'' — both now included in ''Lloydia''), [[Tulipeae]] (''[[Erythronium]]'', ''[[Tulipa]]'' and ''Eduardoregalia'' — now part of ''Tulipa'') and Lilieae (''[[Korolkowia]]'', ''[[Fritillaria]]'', ''[[Notholirion]]'', ''[[Cardiocrinum]]'', ''Nomocharis'' and ''[[Lilium]]'').{{sfn|Buxbaum|1936}}{{sfn|Buxbaum|1937}}{{sfn|Vinnersten|Reeves|2003}} Hutchinson included most of these genera within the Tulipeae tribe.{{sfn|Hutchinson|1959}} The complex rearrangements of the various genera, tribes and subfamilies over a 30-year period from 1985, discussed by Peruzzi and colleagues (2009),{{sfn|Peruzzi|Leitch|Caparelli|2009}} are partly summarised in [[#tab2|Table 2]] below.

Classifications published since the use of [[molecular phylogenetics]] have taken a narrower view of the Liliaceae (''s.s.''). In 1998, [[Minoru N. Tamura|Tamura]] considered ''[[Calochortus]]'' sufficiently distinct to elevate the subfamily [[Calochortoideae]] to family status as Calochortaceae,{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}}{{sfn|Tamura|1998b}} resulting in the term Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura to indicate Liliaceae without the Calochortoideae. In 2009, [[Takhtajan]] used an even narrower definition (see [[#tab2|Table 2]] &amp; [[#tab3|Table 3]] below).{{sfn|Takhtadzhi︠a︡n|2009|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=oumyfO-NHuUC&amp;pg=PA634 Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;634 ]}}

Despite now having established a taxonomic grouping for the Liliaceae family that is genetically monophyletic, compared to the prior longstanding [[polyphyletic]] assemblages under this name,{{sfn|Chase et al.| 1995a}}{{sfn|Chase|Stevenson|Wilkin|Rudall|1995b}} the morphology remains diverse,{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} and there exists within the Liliaceae clade a number of subclades. There appeared to be two major clades, the first and largest of these consisted of three subclades: ''Clintonia''—''Medeola''—''Gagea'', ''Lilium'' ''Fritillaria''—''Notholirion'', and ''Tulipa—Erythronium''. The second smaller clade, ''Streptopus''—''Tricyrtis'' contained elements of Dahlgren's Uvulariaceae. The position of ''Calochortus'' remained problematic, being considered a sister clade to Liliaceae, as treated by Tamura, but further analysis suggested it was in fact sister to ''Tricyrtis'', although it is now considered separate once again (see [[#Tab3|Table 3]]).{{sfn|Rudall et al.|2000}}{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}}{{sfn|Fay et al.|2006}}{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013a}}{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013b}}

Also enigmatic were ''Clintonia'', ''Medeola'', ''Scoliopus'', and ''Tricyrtis''. ''Clintonia'', with a [[disjunct distribution]] involving East Asia and North America, and the closely related ''Medeola'' form a subclades and are now considered a separate tribe (Medeoleae) within the Lilioideae, although at different times they have been considered a separate subfamily (Medeoloideae) or family (Medeolaceae). Sequencing of the ''rbcL ''and ''matK'' chloroplast genes established monophyly for ''Clintonia'', but with separate clades corresponding to the two areas of distribution.{{sfn|Hayashi et al.|2001}} The [[Angiosperm Phylogeny Website]] (APWeb){{sfn|Stevens|2015|loc=[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APWeb/orders/Lilialesweb.htm#Liliaceae Liliaceae]}} includes four of Takhtajan's families in Liliaceae, recognizing three subfamilies, one of which is divided into two tribes and referred to as Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG III.{{sfn|Mabberley|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFFgAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA489 Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;489]}}

==== Historical treatment ====

Historically, the inclusion of genera within Liliaceae has been extremely broad. Of the various published systems, one of the best known and also the broadest modern circumscription is the [[Cronquist system]] (1981),{{sfn|Cronquist|1981}} which included nearly 300 genera in Liliaceae. Most of these have been reassigned to other families, as shown in the following collapsed list, following [[ITIS]], together with their disposition as APG III transfers to other families and subfamilies, within [[Liliales]] and three other orders, [[Alismatales]], [[Asparagales]] and [[Dioscoreales]]. Current members of Liliaceae are shown in '''bold'''.{{sfn|Chase et al.|2009}}

The largest genera are ''Gagea'' (200),{{sfn|Tison|Peterson|Harpke|Peruzzi|2012}} ''Fritillaria'' (130), ''Lilium'' (110), and ''Tulipa'' (75 species), all within the Lilieae tribe. Various authorities (''e.g.'' [[ITIS]] 16,{{sfn|ITIS|2015|loc=[https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=42633&amp;source=from_print Liliaceae]}} [[Germplasm Resources Information Network|GRIN]] 27,{{sfn|GRIN|2015|loc=[http://www.ars-grin.gov/cgi-bin/npgs/html/family.pl?652 Liliaceae]}} [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families|WCSP]],{{sfn|WCLSPF|2015|loc=[http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/qsearch.do?plantName=Liliaceae Liliaceae]}} [[National Center for Biotechnology Information|NCBI]],{{sfn|NCBI|2015|loc=[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Taxonomy/Browser/wwwtax.cgi?id=4677 Liliaceae]}} DELTA{{sfn|Watson|Dallwitz|2015|loc=[http://delta-intkey.com/angio/www/liliacea.htm Liliaceae Juss.]}}) differ on the exact number of genera included in Liliaceae ''s.s.'', but generally there are about fifteen to sixteen genera, depending on whether or not ''[[Amana (plant)|Amana]]'' is included in ''[[Tulipa]]'' and ''Lloydia'' in ''[[Gagea]]''. For instance ''Amana'' is still listed separately in WCSP.

The exact subdivision of Liliaceae differs between authors. In 2002 Patterson and Givnish identified two major clades corresponding to Tamura's Calochortaceae and Liliaceae,{{sfn|Tamura|1998a}} but preferred to retain his original division into two separate families rather than the overarching "core Liliales" (Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG). Within Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura they confirmed his decision to include Medeola-Clintonia as a separate subfamily, Medeolioideae, with the remaining genera as subfamily Lilioideae. Liliodeae was then divided into two tribes, Lilieae and Tulipeae (''Tulipa'', ''Erythronium'', ''Gagea'', ''Lloydia''). Within Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura, they proposed erecting a second subfamily, Streptopoideae (''Prosartes'', ''Scoliopus'', ''Streptopus''), with the remaining genera in subfamily Calochortoideae.{{sfn|Patterson|Givnish|2002}} Subsequent work by Rønsted ''et al.''(2005){{sfn|Rønsted et al.|2005}} and by Fay ''et al.'' (2006) confirmed the overall phylogenetic relationships of Patterson and Givnish and their subdivisions, and further elucidated the position of ''Gagea'' within the tribe Tulipae, but the latter authors restored the broader circumscription of Liliaceae ''sensu'' APG .{{sfn|Fay et al.|2006}} In 2013, Kim ''et al.'' proposed further subdivision, placing the two genera of Calochortoideae (''Calochortus'' and ''Tricyrtis'') into subfamilies of their own and splitting off ''Gagea'' from the rest of Tulipeae by resurrecting the tribe [[Lloydieae]].{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013a}}{{sfn|Kim et al.|2013b}} (see [[#tab 3|Table 3]])

The best known schema, the [[APWeb]], lists fifteen genera, arranged as follows, and illustrated in Table 4, with three subfamilies, [[Lilioideae]] representing Liliaceae ''sensu'' Tamura and the two subfamilies of Calochortaceae ''sensu'' Tamura ([[Streptopoideae]] and [[Calochortoideae]]) as proposed by Patterson and Givnish now included within Lilaceae sensu APG.{{sfn|Stevens|2015|loc=[http://www.mobot.org/MOBOT/Research/APWeb/orders/Lilialesweb.htm#Liliaceae Liliaceae]}}

== Etymology ==
The name Liliaceae was coined by [[Michel Adanson]] in 1763.{{sfn|Adanson|1763|loc=[https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/6958#page/588/mode/1up VIII Liliaceae p.&amp;nbsp;42–60]}} The name was derived from ''[[Lilium]]'' and the [[Taxonomic rank#Terminations of names|family suffix]] ''-aceae''. ''Lilium'' is the [[type genus]] of the family, which is the [[Latin]] for Lily, which in turn came from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] name for it, ''λείριον'' (leírion).{{sfn|Gledhill|2006|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=NJ6PyhVuecwC&amp;pg=PA16 Family names p.&amp;nbsp;16]}}{{sfn|OED|2005}}

'''Convergence''' is a phenomenon in telecommunication and media industry to integrate services, content offerings, and means of communication under one core technology or ecosystem. It includes cultural, society, business, service, technology, regulatory, and content aspects that need to be considered.

It’s practical application manifests in various concrete examples, as e.g. Internet, digital convergence, media convergence, home applications, and telecommunication. This article describes a wide are of aspects of convergence, with illustrations of convergent merging technologies (NBIC, nano-, bio-, info- and cognitive technologies) and convergence of media technology.

==Definitions==
"'''''Convergence''' is a deep integration of knowledge, tools, and all relevant activities of human activity for a common goal, to allow society to answer new questions to change the respective physical or social ecosystem. Such changes in the respective ecosystem open new trends, pathways, and opportunities in the following divergent phase of the process''" (Roco 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Roco | first1 = MC | year = 2002 | title = 'Coherence and divergence of megatrends in science and engineering | url =https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1020157027792 | journal = J Nanopart Res | volume = 4 | issue = | pages = 9–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bainbridge and Roco 2016 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bainbridge | first1 = W.S. | last2 = Roco | first2 = M.C. | year = 2016 | title = 'Science and technology convergence: with emphasis for nanotechnology-inspired convergence | url = | journal = J. Nanoparticle Res. | volume = 18 | issue = | page = 211 | doi=10.1007/s11051-016-3520-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;). [[File:Leatherman-Charge-XTi.jpg|thumb|A converged mechanical tool, the multitool. Within one device, it provides many tools.]]
Siddhartha Menon defines convergence, in his ''Policy initiative Dilemmas on Media Covergence: A Cross National Perspective'', as integration and digitalization. Integration, here, is defined as "a process of transformation measure by the degree to which diverse media such as phone, data broadcast and information technology infrastructures are combined into a single seamless all purpose network architecture platform".&lt;ref&gt;Siddhartha, 2&lt;/ref&gt; Digitalization is not so much defined by its physical infrastructure, but by the content or the medium. [[Jan van Dijk]] suggests that "digitalization means breaking down signals into bytes consisting of ones and zeros".&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, J. (1999). The network society. London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Menon, Siddhartha. "Policy Initiative Dilemmas On Media Convergence: A Cross National Perspective." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–35. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 20 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is defined by Blackman, 1998, as a trend in the evolution of technology services and industry structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Blackman | first1 = C | year = 1998 | title = Convergence between telecommunications and other media: how should regulation adapt? | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 163–170 | doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Convergence is later defined more specifically as the coming together of telecommunications, computing and broadcasting into a single digital bit-stream.&lt;ref&gt;Collin, 1998; Gates, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conlins | first1 = R | year = 1998 | title = Back to the future: Digital Television and Convergence in the United Kingdom | url = | journal = Telecommunication Policy | volume = 22 | issue = 4–5| pages = 383–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gate | first1 = A | year = 2000 | title = Convergence and competition: Technological change, industry concentration and competition policy in the telecommunications sector | url = | journal = University of Toronto Faculty of Law Review | volume = 58 | issue = 2| pages = 83–117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mueller stands against the statement that convergence is really a takeover of all forms of media by one technology: digital computers.&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, 1999, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mueller | first1 = M | year = 1999 | title = Digital Convergence and its consequences | url = | journal = Javnost/The Public | volume = 6 | issue = 3| pages = 11–27 | doi=10.1080/13183222.1999.11008716}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Media technological convergence''' is the tendency that as [[technological change|technology changes]], different technological system sometimes evolve toward performing similar tasks. Digital convergence refers to the convergence of four industries into one conglomerate, ITTCE ([[IT industry|Information Technologies]], [[telecommunication industry|Telecommunication]], [[Consumer Electronics]], and  [[Entertainment industry|Entertainment]]). Previously separate technologies such as voice (and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video can now share resources and interact with each other synergistically. Telecommunications convergence (also called "network convergence") describes emerging [[telecommunications]] technologies, and [[network architecture]] used to migrate multiple communications services into a single network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchnetworkingchannel.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid100_gci1310061,00.html|title=What is network convergence? - Definition from WhatIs.com|work=SearchITChannel|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically this involves the converging of previously distinct media such as [[telephony]] and [[data communications]] into common interfaces on single devices, such as most smart phones can make phone calls and search the web.

'''Media convergence''' is the interlinking of computing and other information technologies, media content, media companies and communication networks that have arisen as the result of the evolution and popularization of the Internet as well as the activities, products and services that have emerged in the digital media space. Closely linked to the multilevel process of media convergence are also several developments in different areas of the media and communication sector which are also summarized under the term of [[media deconvergence]]. Many experts{{who|date=May 2013}} view this as simply being the tip of the iceberg, as all facets of institutional activity and social life such as business, government, art, journalism, health, and education are increasingly being carried out in these digital media spaces across a growing network of [[information and communication technology]] devices. Also included in this topic is the basis of computer networks, wherein many different operating systems are able to communicate via different [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]]. 
Convergent services, such as [[VoIP]], [[IPTV]], [[Smart TV]], and others, tend to replace the older technologies and thus can [[disruptive innovation|disrupt markets]]. IP-based convergence is inevitable and will result in new service and new demand in the market.&lt;ref name = "Shin"&gt;Shin, Dong Hee, Won – Yong Kim, and Dong-Hoon Lee. "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications." Conference Papers – International Communication Association (2006): 1–19. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. EBSCO. Web. 26 Oct. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; When the old technology converges into the public-owned common, IP based services become access-independent or less dependent. The old service is access-dependent.&lt;ref&gt;Grieve, W. and Levin, S. (2005). From Clones To Packets: The Development Of Competition In Local Residential Telecommunications. TPRC 2005 The 33rd Research Conference on Communication, Information and Internet Policy, September 23–25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History of media technological convergence ==

Communication networks were designed to carry different types of information independently. The older media, such as television and radio, are broadcasting networks with passive audiences. Convergence of telecommunication technology permits the manipulation of all forms of information, voice, data, and video.  Telecommunication has changed from a world of scarcity to one of seemingly limitless capacity. Consequently, the possibility of audience interactivity morphs the passive audience into an engaged audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blackman|first=Colin|journal=Telecommunication Policy|title=Convergence between telecommunications and other media|year=1998|volume=22|issue=Elsevier Science Ltd.|pages=163–170|doi=10.1016/s0308-5961(98)00003-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historical roots of convergence can be traced back to the emergence of [[mobile telephony]] and the [[Internet]], although the term properly applies only from the point in marketing history when fixed and mobile telephony began to be offered by operators as joined products. Fixed and mobile operators were, for most of the 1990s, independent companies. Even when the same organization marketed both products, these were sold and serviced independently.

In the 1990s an implicit and often explicit assumption was that new media was going to replace the old media and Internet was going to replace broadcasting. In Nicholas Negroponte's ''[[Being Digital]]'', Negroponte predicts the collapse of broadcast networks in favor of an era of narrow-casting. He also suggests that no government regulation can shatter the [[media conglomerate]]. "The monolithic empires of mass media are dissolving into an array of cottage industries... Media barons of today will be grasping to hold onto their centralized empires tomorrow.... The combined forces of technology and human nature will ultimately take a stronger hand in plurality than any laws Congress can invent."&lt;ref&gt;Negroponte, Nicholas. ''Being Digital''. Knopf, 1995. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The new media companies claimed that the old media would be absorbed fully and completely into the orbit of the emerging technologies.
[[George Gilder]] dismisses such claims saying,{{clarify|date=April 2015}} "The computer industry is converging with the television industry in the same sense that the automobile converged with the horse, the TV converged with the nickelodeon, the word-processing program converged with the typewriter, the CAD program converged with the drafting board, and digital desktop publishing converged with the Linotype machine and the letterpress." Gilder believes that computers had come not to transform mass culture but to destroy it.

Media companies put Media Convergence back to their agenda, after the [[dot-com bubble]] burst. Erstwhile Knight Ridder promulgated concept of portable magazines, newspaper, and books in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Smith, G. |title=Back to the Future: The Tablet computer that looks just like an iPad... but it is 17 Years Old |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-1381528/Knight-Ridder-tablet-looks-just-like-iPad-17-YEARS-OLD.html |publisher=MailOnline |date=28 April 2011 |accessdate=2013-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;"Within news corporations it became increasingly obvious that an editorial model based on mere replication in the internet of contents that had previously been written for print newspapers, radio, or television was no longer sufficient."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Ramón Salaverria, Media Convergence|url = https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|website = online.journalism.utexas.edu|accessdate = 2015-11-20|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20151120215558/https://online.journalism.utexas.edu/detail.php?story=251&amp;year=2008|archive-date = 2015-11-20|dead-url = yes|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of digital communication in the late 20th century has made it possible for media organizations (or individuals) to deliver text, audio, and video material over the same wired, wireless, or fiber-optic connections. At the same time, it inspired some media organizations to explore multimedia delivery of information. This digital convergence of news media, in particular, was called "Mediamorphosis" by researcher Roger Fidler [https://web.archive.org/web/20090315053135/http://rji.missouri.edu/staff-and-advisers/roger-fidler.php], in his 1997 book by that name. Today, we are surrounded by a multi-level convergent media world where all modes of communication and information are continually reforming to adapt to the enduring demands of technologies, "changing the way we create, consume, learn and interact with each other".&lt;ref&gt;(Jenkins, Henry (2006) Convergence Culture, New York University Press, New York.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Converging technological fields ==

'''NBIC''', an acronym for [[Nanotechnology|'''N'''anotechnology]], [[Biotechnology|'''B'''iotechnology]], [[Information technology|'''I'''nformation technology]] and [[Cognitive science|'''C'''ognitive science]], was, in 2014,  the most popular term for converging technologies. It was introduced into public discourse through the publication of ''[[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]'', a report sponsored in part by the U.S. [[National Science Foundation]].&lt;ref name="Roco and Bainbridge 2003"&gt;{{cite book| editor = Roco, Mihail C.| editor2 = Bainbridge, William Sims| editor2-link = William Sims Bainbridge| title = [[Converging Technologies for Improving Human Performance]]| publisher = Springer| date = 2003| isbn = 1-4020-1254-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other acronyms have been offered for the same concept such as GNR ([[Genetics|'''G'''enetics]], '''N'''anotechnology and [[Robotics|'''R'''obotics]]) ([[Bill Joy]], 2000, [[Why The Future Doesn't Need Us|Why the future doesn't need us]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us | first = Bill | last= Joy | authorlink= Bill Joy | url= https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy.html |publisher= Wired |date= 2000  }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Examples of technology implications ==

Convergent solutions include both [[Landline|fixed-line]] and mobile technologies. Recent examples of new, convergent services include:

* Using the Internet for voice and [[video telephony]]
* [[Video on demand]]
* [[Fixed-mobile convergence]]
* [[Mobile-to-mobile convergence]]
* [[Location-based service]]s
* Integrated products and bundles

Convergent technologies can integrate the fixed-line with mobile to deliver convergent solutions. Convergent technologies include:

* [[IP Multimedia Subsystem]]
* [[Session Initiation Protocol]]
* [[IPTV]]
* [[Voice over IP]]
* [[Voice call continuity]]
* [[DVB-H|Digital video broadcasting – handheld]]

==Convergence in appliances==
Some media observers expect that we will eventually access all media content through one device, or "black box".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/1986-04-compute-magazine/Compute_Issue_071_1986_Apr#page/n21/mode/2|title=Compute! Magazine Issue 071|publisher=|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, media business practice has been to identify the next "black box" to invest in and provide media for. This has caused a number of problems. Firstly, as "black boxes" are invented and abandoned, the individual is left with numerous devices that can perform the same task, rather than one dedicated for each task. For example, one may own both a computer and a video games console, subsequently owning two DVD players. This is contrary to the streamlined goal of the "black box" theory, and instead creates clutter.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, 15&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, technological convergence tends to be experimental in nature. This has led to consumers owning technologies with additional functions that are harder, if not impractical, to use rather than one specific device. Many people would only watch the TV for the duration of the meal's cooking time, or whilst in the kitchen, but would not use the microwave as the household TV. These examples show that in many cases technological convergence is unnecessary or unneeded.

Furthermore, although consumers primarily use a specialized media device for their needs, other "black box" devices that perform the same task can be used to suit their current situation. As a 2002 Cheskin Research report explained: "...Your email needs and expectations are different whether you're at home, work, school, commuting, the airport, etc., and these different devices are designed to suit your needs for accessing content depending on where you are- your situated context." Despite the creation of "black boxes", intended to perform all tasks, the trend is to use devices that can suit the consumer's physical position.&lt;ref&gt;Cheskin Research. "Designing Digital Experiences for Youth", Market Insights Series, Fall 2002 pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the variable utility of portable technology, convergence occurs in high end mobile devices. They incorporate multimedia services, GPS, Internet access, and mobile telephony into a single device, heralding the rise of what has been termed the "smart phone," a device designed to remove the need to carry multiple devices. Convergence of media occurs when multiple products come together to form one product with the advantages of all of them, also known as the black box. This idea of one technology, concocted by [[Henry Jenkins]], has become known more as a fallacy because of the inability to actually put all technical pieces into one. For example, while people can have e-mail and Internet on their phone, they still want full computers with Internet and e-mail in addition. Mobile phones are a good example, in that they  incorporate [[digital camera]]s, mp3 players, [[dictaphone|voice recorder]]s, and other devices. This type of convergence is popular.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} For the consumer, it means more features in less space; for [[media conglomerate]]s it means remaining competitive.

However, convergence has a downside. Particularly in initial forms, converged devices are frequently less functional and reliable than their component parts (e.g., a mobile phone's web browser may not render some web pages correctly, due to not supporting certain rendering methods, such as the [[iPhone]] browser not supporting [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] content). As the number of functions in a single device escalates, the ability of that device to serve its original function decreases.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture: Where Old and New Media Collide'' New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; As Rheingold asserts, technological convergence holds immense potential for the "improvement of life and liberty in some ways and (could) degrade it in others".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; He believes the same technology has the potential to be "used as both a weapon of social control and a means of resistance".&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"/&gt; Since technology has evolved in the past ten years or so, companies are beginning to converge technologies to create demand for new products. This includes phone companies integrating [[3G]] and [[4G]] on their phones. In the mid 20th century, television converged the technologies of movies and radio, and television is now being converged with the mobile phone industry and the Internet. Phone calls are also being made with the use of personal computers. Converging technologies combine multiple technologies into one. Newer mobile phones feature cameras, and can hold images, videos, music, and other media. Manufacturers now integrate more advanced features, such as video recording, GPS receivers, data storage, and security mechanisms into the traditional cellphone.

==Convergence on the internet==
The role of the [[internet]] has changed from its original use as a communication tool to easier and faster access to information and services, mainly through a [[broadband]] connection. The television, radio and newspapers were the world's media for accessing news and entertainment; now, all three media have converged into one, and people all over the world can read and hear news and other information on the internet. The convergence of the internet and conventional TV became popular in the 2010s, through [[Smart TV]], also sometimes referred to as "Connected TV" or "Hybrid TV", (not to be confused with [[IPTV]], [[Internet TV]], or with [[Web television|Web TV]]). Smart TV is used to describe the current trend of integration of the Internet and [[Web 2.0]] features into modern [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es, as well as the technological convergence between computers and these television sets or set-top boxes. These new [[information appliance|devices]] most often also have a much higher focus on [[online]] [[interactive media]], [[Internet TV]], [[over-the-top content]], as well as [[video on demand|on-demand]] [[streaming media]], and less focus on traditional [[broadcasting|broadcast]] media like previous generations of [[television set]]s and [[set-top box]]es always have had.&lt;ref name="businessinsider1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Kovach |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-a-smart-tv-2010-12 |title=What Is A Smart TV? |publisher=Businessinsider.com |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital convergence==
Digital Convergence means inclination for various innovations, media sources, content that become similar with the time. It enables the convergence of access devices and content as well as the industry participant operations and strategy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Digital Product Management, Technology and Practice: Interdisciplinary Perspectives: Interdisciplinary Perspectives|last=Strader|first=Troy|publisher=Business Science Reference|year=2011|isbn=9781616928773|location=Hershey, PA|pages=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is how this type of technological convergence creates opportunities, particularly in the area of product development and growth strategies for digital product companies.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The same can be said in the case of individual content producers such as vloggers in the [[YouTube]] video-sharing platform. The convergence in this example is demonstrated in the involvement of the Internet, home devices such as smart television, camera, the YouTube application, and the digital content. In this setup, there are the so-called "spokes",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Strategies and Policies in Digital Convergence|last=Park|first=Sangin|publisher=Idea Group Reference|year=2007|isbn=1599041561|location=Hershey, PA|pages=106}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are the devices that connect to a central hub, which could either be the smart TV or PC. Here, the Internet serves as the intermediary, particularly through its interactivity tools and social networking, in order to create unique mixes of products and services via horizontal integration.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The above example highlights how digital convergence encompasses three phenomena:

# previously stand-alone devices are being connected by networks and software, significantly enhancing functionalities;
# previously stand-alone products are being converged onto the same platform, creating hybrid products in the process; and,
# companies are crossing traditional boundaries such as hardware and software to provide new products and new sources of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marketing of High-technology Products and Innovations|last=Mohr|first=Jakki|last2=Sengupta|first2=Sanjit|last3=Slater|first3=Stanley|publisher=Prentice Hall|year=2010|isbn=9780136049968|location=Upper Saddle, NJ|pages=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is the convergence of different types of digital contents. According to Harry Strasser, former CTO of [[Siemens]] "[digital convergence will substantially impact people's lifestyle and work style]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/1110194/A_Computing_Studio_Method_for_Teaching_Design_Thinking|title=A Computing Studio Method for Teaching Design Thinking|last=Van der Post|first=L.|date=2010|publisher=Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University|pages=12–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next hot trend in digital convergence is converged content, mixing personal (user-generated) content with professional (copyright protected) content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/sep/15/the-new-media-ownership-law-doesnt-address-the-real-crisis-journalism-is-facing|title=The new media ownership law doesn't address the real crisis journalism is facing|publisher=The Guardian|author=Margaret Simons}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example are personal music videos that combine user-generated photos with chart music. The German startup [[Trivid GmbH]] has developed [[Clipgenerator]] that enables users to create personal music videos with popular chart music and to share them in social communities such as [[Facebook]], [[Myspace]] and [[Bebo]].

==Convergence in the marketplace==
Convergence is a global marketplace dynamic in which different companies and sectors are being brought together, both as competitors and collaborators, across traditional boundaries of industry and technology. In a world dominated by convergence, many traditional products, services and types of companies will become less relevant, but a stunning array of new ones is possible. An array of technology developments act as accelerators of convergence, including mobility, analytics, cloud, digital and social networks. As a disruptive force, convergence is a threat to the unprepared, but a tremendous growth opportunity for companies that can out-innovate and out-execute their ever-expanding list of competitors under dramatically new marketplace rules. With convergence, lines are blurred as companies diversify outside of their original markets. For instance, mobile services are increasingly an important part of the automobile; chemicals companies work with agribusiness; device manufacturers sell music, video and books; booksellers become consumer device companies; search and advertising companies become telecommunications companies ("telcos"); media companies act like telcos and vice versa; retailers act like financial services companies and vice versa; cosmetics companies work with pharmaceutical companies; and more. Mobile phone usage broadens dramatically, enabling users to make payments online, watch videos, or even adjusting their home thermostat while away at work.

==Media convergence{{anchor|Media}}==
Generally, media convergence refers to the merging of both old and new media and can be seen as a product, a system or a process. Jenkins states that convergence is, "the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behaviour of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted"&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins (2006) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, pg 2&lt;/ref&gt; According to Jenkins, there are five areas of convergence: technological, economic, social or organic, cultural and global.&lt;ref&gt;The Handbook of global online journalism, edited by Eugenia Siapera and  Andreas Vilglis, pg 26&lt;/ref&gt; So media convergence is not just a technological shift or a technological process, it also includes shifts within the industrial, cultural, and social paradigms that encourage the consumer to seek out new information. Convergence, simply put, is how individual consumers interact with others on a social level and use various media platforms to create new experiences, new forms of media and content that connect us socially, and not just to other consumers, but to the corporate producers of media in ways that have not been as readily accessible in the past. However, Lugmayr and Dal Zotto argued, that media convergence takes place on technology, content, consumer, business model, and management level.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 2, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783662482926&lt;/ref&gt; They argue, that media convergence is a matter of evolution and can be described through the triadic phenomenon of convergence, divergence, and coexistence. Today's digital media ecosystems coexist, as e.g. mobile app stores provide vendor lock-ins into particular eco-systems; some technology platforms are converging under one technology, due to e.g. the usage of common communication protocols as in digital TV; and other media are diverging, as e.g. media content offerings are more and more specializing and provides a space for niche media.&lt;ref&gt;Artur Lugmayr, Cinzia Dal Zotto, Media Convergence is NOT King: The Triadic Phenomenon of Media 'Convergence-Divergence-Coexistance' is King. Media Convergence Handbook Vol. 1, Springer-Verlag, 2016, https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302467971_Media_Convergence_is_NOT_King_The_Triadic_Phenomenon_of_Media_Convergence-Divergence-Coexistence_IS_King&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances in technology bring the ability for technological convergence that Rheingold believes can alter the "social-side effects," in that "the virtual, social and physical world are colliding, merging and coordinating."&lt;ref name="Rheingold, Howard 2000 pp 157-82"&gt;Rheingold, Howard (2000) Smart Mobs: the next social revolution, Perseus, Cambridge, Massachusetts, pp 157–82&lt;/ref&gt; It was predicted in the late 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/1988-02-compute-magazine|title=COMPUTE! magazine issue 93 Feb 1988|quote=If the wheels behind the CD-ROM industry have their way, this product will help open the door to a brave, new multimedia world for  microcomputers, where the computer is intimately linked with the other household electronics, and every gadget in the house reads  tons of video, audio, and text data from CD-ROM disks. }}&lt;/ref&gt; around the time that [[CD-ROM]] was becoming commonplace, that a [[digital revolution]] would take place, and that old media would be pushed to one side by [[new media]]. Broadcasting is increasingly being replaced by the Internet, enabling consumers all over the world the freedom to access their preferred media content more easily and at a more available rate than ever before.

However, when the [[dot-com bubble]] of the 1990s suddenly popped, that poured cold water over the talk of such a digital revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. (2008) Convergence Culture : Where Old and New Media Collide, 2nd ed., p.6&lt;/ref&gt; In today's society, the idea of media convergence has once again emerged as a key point of reference as newer as well as established media companies attempt to visualize the future of the entertainment industry. If this revolutionary digital paradigm shift presumed that old media would be increasingly replaced by new media, the convergence paradigm that is currently emerging suggests that new and old media would interact in more complex ways than previously predicted. The paradigm shift that followed the digital revolution assumed that new media was going to change everything. When the dot com market crashed, there was a tendency to imagine that nothing had changed. The real truth lay somewhere in between as there were so many aspects of the current media environment to take into consideration. Many industry leaders are increasingly reverting to media convergence as a way of making sense in an era of disorientating change. In that respect, media convergence in theory is essentially an old concept taking on a new meaning. Media convergence, in reality, is more than just a shift in technology. It alters relationships between industries, technologies, audiences, genres and markets. Media convergence changes the rationality media industries operate in, and the way that media consumers process news and entertainment. Media convergence is essentially a process and not an outcome, so no single black box controls the flow of media. With proliferation of different media channels and increasing portability of new telecommunications and computing technologies, we have entered into an era where media constantly surrounds us.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner | first=Tobias | title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014 | url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902/Under_the_Macroscope_Convergence_in_the_US_Television_Market_between_2000_and_2014 | work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence requires that media companies rethink existing assumptions about media from the consumer's point of view, as these affect marketing and programming decisions. Media producers must respond to newly empowered consumers.
Conversely, it would seem that hardware is instead diverging whilst media content is converging. Media has developed into brands that can offer content in a number of forms. Two examples of this are ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Matrix]]''. Both are films, but are also books, video games, cartoons, and action figures. Branding encourages expansion of one concept, rather than the creation of new ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins 2006, p.101-112&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, hardware has diversified to accommodate media convergence. Hardware must be specific to each function. While most scholars argue that the flow of cross-media is accelerating,&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins H, Deuze M (2008) Editorial: Convergence culture. Convergence 14(1): 5¡V12.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell suggests, especially between films and video game, the semblance of media convergence is misunderstood by people outside of the media production industry. The conglomeration of media industry continues to sell the same story line in different media. For example, Batman is  in comics, films, anime, and games. However, the data to create the image of batman in each media is created individually by different teams of creators. The same character and the same visual effect repetitively appear in different media is because of the synergy of media industry to make them similar as possible.  In addition, convergence does not happen when the game of two different consoles is produced. No flows between two consoles because it is faster to create game from scratch for the industry.&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Casey. "Games Are Not Convergence: The Lost Promise Of Digital Production And Convergence." Convergence: The Journal of Research Into New Media Technologies 17.3 (2011): 271–286. Communication &amp; Mass Media Complete. Web. 8 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the more interesting new media journalism forms is virtual reality. Reuters, a major international news service, has created and staffed a news “island” in the popular online virtual reality environment Second Life (www.secondlife.com, accessed January 3, 2008). Open to anyone, Second Life has emerged as a compelling 3D virtual reality for millions of citizens around the world who have created avatars (virtual representations of themselves) to populate and live in an altered state where personal flight is a reality, altered egos can flourish, and real money (US$1,296,257 were spent during the 24 hours concluding at 10:19&amp;nbsp;a.m. eastern time January 7, 2008) can be made without ever setting foot into the real world. The Reuters Island in Second Life is a virtual version of the Reuters real-world news service but covering the domain of Second Life for the citizens of Second Life (numbering 11,807,742 residents as of January 5, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Pavlic J. V. New Media Journalism // 21st Century Communication. A Reference Handbook. Volume 1 &amp; 2. /Ed. By William F. Eadie. Los Angeles, 2009. 970 p. P. 643-651.&lt;/ref&gt;

Media convergence in the digital era means the changes that are taking place with older forms of media and media companies. Media convergence has two roles, the first is the technological merging of different media channels – for example, magazines, radio programs, TV shows, and movies, now are available on the Internet through laptops, iPads, and smartphones. As discussed in ''Media Culture'' (by Campbell), convergence of technology is not new. It has been going on since the late 1920s.  An example is RCA, the Radio Corporation of America, which purchased Victor Talking Machine Company and introduced machines that could receive radio and play recorded music.  Next came the TV, and radio lost some of its appeal as people started watching television, which has both talking and music as well as visuals.  As technology advances, convergence of media change to keep up. The second definition of media convergence Campbell discusses is cross-platform by media companies. This usually involves consolidating various media holdings, such as cable, phone, television (over the air, satellite, cable) and Internet access under one corporate umbrella. This is not for the consumer to have more media choices, this is for the benefit of the company to cut down on costs and maximize its profits.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;Campbell, Richard, Christopher R. Martin, and Bettina Fabos. Media &amp; Culture An Introduction To Mass Communication. 8th ed. Boston: Bedford/St. Martin's, 2013. 9–10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  As stated in the article, Convergence Culture and Media Work, by Mark Deuze, “the convergence of production and consumption of media across companies, channels, genres, and technologies is an expression of the convergence of all aspects of everyday life: work and play, the local and the global, self and social identity."&lt;ref name=Holt&gt;Holt, Jennifer, and Alisa Perren, eds.

=== Convergence culture ===

[[Henry Jenkins]] determines convergence culture to be the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who will go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they want. The convergence culture is an important factor in [[transmedia storytelling]].  Convergence culture introduces new stories and arguments from one form of media into many. Transmedia storytelling is defined by Jenkins as a process "where integral elements of a fiction get dispersed systematically across multiple delivery channels for the purpose of creating a unified and coordinated entertainment experience. Ideally, each medium makes its own unique contribution to the unfolding of the story".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2011/08/defining_transmedia_further_re.html#sthash.xLqb8MkC.dpuf |title= Transmedia 202: Further Reflections |date=August 1, 2011 |accessdate= April 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[The Matrix (franchise)|The Matrix]] starts as a [[The Matrix|film]], which is followed by two other instalments, but in a convergence culture it is not constrained to that form. It becomes a story not only told in the movies but in [[The Animatrix|animated shorts]], video games and comic books, three different media platforms. Online, a wiki is created to keep track of the story's expanding canon. Fan films, discussion forums, and social media pages also form, expanding The Matrix to different online platforms. Convergence culture took what started as a film and expanded it across almost every type of media.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"&gt;HCD Media Group, . Henry Jenkins. 2009. Video.

Convergence culture is a part of [[participatory culture]]. Because average people can now access their interests on many types of media they can also have more of a say. Fans and consumers are able to participate in the creation and circulation of new content. Some companies take advantage of this and search for feedback from their customers through social media and sharing sites such as [[YouTube]]. 
Besides marketing and entertainment, convergence culture has also affected the way we interact with news and information. We can access news on multiple levels of media from the radio, TV, newspapers, and the internet. The internet allows more people to be able to report the news through independent broadcasts and therefore allows a multitude of perspectives to be put forward and accessed by people in many different areas. Convergence allows news to be gathered on a much larger scale. For instance, photographs were taken of torture at [[Abu Ghraib]]. These photos were shared and eventually posted on the internet. This led to the breaking of a news story in newspapers, on TV, and the internet.&lt;ref name="Jenkens 2009"/&gt;

Media scholar Henry Jenkins has described the media convergence with [[participatory culture]] as:

{{quote|...a "catalyst" for amateur digital film-making and what this case study suggests about the future directions popular culture may take. Star Wars fan films represent the intersection of two significant cultural trends—the corporate movement towards media convergence and the unleashing of significant new tools, which enable the grassroots archiving, annotation, appropriation, and recirculation of media content. These fan films build on long-standing practices of the fan community but they also reflect the influence of this changed technological environment that has dramatically lowered the costs of film production and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/cms/People/henry3/starwars.html|title=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|work=MIT Comparative Media Studies/Writing|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Cell phone convergence ===
The social function of the cell phone changes as the technology converges. Because of technological advancement, cell phones function more than just as a phone. They contain an internet connection, video players, MP3 players, gaming, and a camera. Another example, [[Rok Sako To Rok Lo]] (2004) was screened in Delhi, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mumbai, and other part of India through EDGE-enabled mobile phones with live video streaming facility.&lt;ref name = "Jenkins"/&gt;{{page needed|date=May 2013}}

=== Social movements ===
The integration of [[social movement]]s in cyberspace is one of the potential strategies that social movements can use in the age of media convergence. Because of the [[Net neutrality|neutrality of the internet]] and the [[End-to-end principle|end-to-end design]], the power structure of the internet was designed to avoid discrimination between applications. Mexico's [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatistas]] campaign for land rights was one of the most influential case in the information age; Manuel Castells defines the Zapatistas as "the first informational guerrilla movement".&lt;ref&gt;Castells, 2004:82&lt;/ref&gt; The Zapatista uprising had been marginalized by the popular press. The Zapatistas were able to construct a grassroots, decentralized social movement by using the internet. The Zapatistas Effect, observed by Cleaver,&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; continues to organize social movements on a global scale. A sophisticated webmetric analysis, which maps the links between different websites and seeks to identify important nodal points in a network, demonstrates that the Zapatistas cause binds together hundreds of global NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;Garrido and Halavais, 2003:181&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the social movement organized by Zapatistas targets their campaign especially against global neoliberalism.&lt;ref&gt;Cleaver, 1988:630&lt;/ref&gt; A successful social movement not only need online support but also protest on the street. Papic wrote, "Social Media Alone Do Not Instigate Revolutions", which discusses how the use of social media in social movements needs good organization both online and offline.&lt;ref&gt;Papic, M., Noonan, S. (2011) "Social Media As a Tool for Protest." Stratfor, 3 Feb. 2011. Web. 20 Nov. 2011. {{cite web |url=http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512075702/http://www.stratfor.com/weekly/20110202-social-media-tool-protest |archivedate=2013-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study, "Journalism in the age of media convergence: a survey of undergraduates’ technology-related news habits", concluded that several focus group respondents reported they generally did not actively engage in media convergence, such as viewing slide shows or listening to podcast that accompanied an online story, as part of their Web-based news consumption, a significant number of students indicated the interactive features often associated with online news and media convergence were indeed appealing to them.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins, L,. "JOURNALISM IN THE AGE OF MEDIA CONVERGENCE: A SURVEY OF UNDERGRADUATES’ TECHNOLOGY-RELATED NEWS HABITS", International Journal of Trends in Economics Management &amp; Technology (IJTEMT), Vol.3 Issue 2, {{ISSN|2321-5518}}, April 2014, pp: 41–48&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples in Regulation ==

===Example: VoIP===
The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has not been able to decide how to regulate VoIP (Internet Telephony) because the convergent technology is still growing and changing. In addition to its growth, FCC is tentative to set regulation on VoIP in order to promote competition in the telecommunication industry.&lt;ref&gt;Written in 2011, 10, 27&lt;/ref&gt; There is not a clear line between telecommunication service and the information service because of the growth of the new convergent media. Historically, telecommunication is subject to state regulation. The state of California concerned about the increasing popularity of internet telephony will eventually obliterate funding for the [[Universal Service Fund]]&lt;ref&gt;Kopytoff, V. (2005). Internet Phones in Spotlight, Companies face more scrutiny by U.S., state agencies. IP Telephony News, March, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Some states attempt to assert their traditional role of common carrier oversight onto this new technology.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, J (2004). California Regulator Vote to Exammine Rules to Control Voice Over Internet Protocol. ''Electronic Commerce and Law Report'' (Vol. 9, No.7) 156-57&lt;/ref&gt; Meisel and Needles (2005) suggests that the FCC, federal courts, and state regulatory bodies on access line charges will directly impact the speed in which Internet telephony market grows.&lt;ref&gt;Meisel, J., Needles, M. Voice over Internet protocol development and public policy Implications. INFO: ''the journal of policy, regulation and strategy for telecommunications, information and media,'' Vol.7, Number 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On one hand, the FCC is hesitant to regulate convergent technology because VoIP with different feature from the old Telecommunication; no fixed model to build legislature yet. On the other hand, the regulations is needed because Service over the internet might be quickly replaced telecommunication service, which will affect the entire economy.

Convergence has also raised several debates about classification of certain telecommunications services. As the lines between data transmission, and voice and media transmission are eroded, regulators are faced with the task of how best to classify the converging segments of the telecommunication sector. Traditionally, telecommunication regulation has focused on the operation of physical infrastructure, networks, and access to network. No content is regulated in the telecommunication because the content is considered private. In contrast, film and Television are regulated by contents. The rating system regulates its distribution to the audience. Self-regulation is promoted by the industry. Bogle senior persuaded the entire industry to pay 0.1 percent levy on all advertising and the money was used to give authority to the Advertising Standards Authority, which keeps the government away from setting legislature in the media industry.&lt;ref&gt;PERSPECTIVE: Media convergence puts self-regulation at top of the agenda." Campaign 1 Nov. 2002: 02. General Reference Center GOLD. Web. 13 Oct. 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The premises to regulate the new media, two-ways communications, concerns much about the change from old media to new media. Each medium has different features and characteristics. First, internet, the new medium, manipulates all form of information – voice, data and video. Second, the old regulation on the old media, such as radio and Television, emphasized its regulation on the scarcity of the channels. Internet, on the other hand, has the limitless capacity, due to the end-to-end design. Third, Two-ways communication encourages interactivity between the content producers and the audiences. 
"...Fundamental basis for classification, therefore, is to consider the need for regulation in terms of either market failure or in the public interests"(Blackman).&lt;ref&gt;

===Emerging trends in communications===
[[Network neutrality]] has emerged as an issue. Wu and Lessig (2004) set out two reasons to adapt neutral network model for computer networks. First, "a neutral network eliminates the risk of future discrimination, providing more incentive to invest in broadband application development." Second, "neutral network facilitates fair competition among application, no bias between applications."&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T., Lessig, L. EX Parte Submission in CS Docket No. 02-52. August, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The two reasons also coincide with FCC's interest to stimulate investment and enhance innovation in broadband technology and services.&lt;ref&gt;FCC, 2004d&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004d). Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, March 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;
Despite regulatory efforts of deregulation, privatization, and liberalization, the  infrastructure barrier has been a negative factor in achieving effective competition. "Kim et al. argues that IP dissociates the telephony application from the infrastructure and Internet telephony is at the forefront of such dissociation."&lt;ref&gt;Kim, et al. Regulating Internet telephony: The Challenges and the Opportunities. Proceedings of 15th Portland International Conference on Technology Management.&lt;/ref&gt;  The neutrality of the network is very important for fair competition.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, T. (2004). Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination, Journal of Telecommunications &amp; High Technology Law, Vol. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; As the former FCC Charman [[Michael Powell]] put it: "From its inception, the Internet was designed, as those present during the course of its creating will tell you, to prevent government or a corporation or anyone else from controlling it. It was designed to defeat [[discrimination]] against users, ideas and technologies".&lt;ref&gt;FCC (2004f). Remarks of Michael J. Copps: Federal Communications Commissioner: The Beginning Of The End Of The Internet? Discrimination, Closed Networks, And The Future of Cyberspace New America Foundation, Washington, Dc. October 9, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these reasons, Shin concludes that regulator should make sure to regulate application and infrastructure separately.

The layered model was first proposed by Solum and Chug, Sicker, and Nakahata. Sicker, Warbach and Witt have supported using a layered model to regulate the telecommunications industry with the emergence of convergence services. Many researchers have different layered approach, but they all agree that the emergence of convergent technology will create challenges and ambiguities for regulations.&lt;ref name = "Shin"/&gt; The key point of the layered model is that it reflects the reality of network architecture, and current business model.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"&gt;Whitt, R.S. (2004). A Horizontal Leap Forward: Formulating a New Communications
Public Policy Framework Based on the Network Layers Mode. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS
LAW JOURNAL, Vol. 56, Number 3, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;
The layered Model consists of 1. Access Layer – where the physical infrastructure resides: copper wires, cable, or fiber optic. 2. transport layer – the provider of service. 3. Application layer –  the interface between the data and the users. 4. content layer – the layer which users see.&lt;ref name = "Whitt"/&gt; In ''Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications'', Shin combines the Layered Model and Network Neutrality as the principle to regulate the future convergent Media Industry.&lt;ref&gt;Shin, D. , Kim, W. and Lee, D. , 2006-06-16 "Convergence Technologies and the Layered Policy Model: Implication for Regulating Future Communications" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the International Communication Association, Dresden International Congress Centre, Dresden, Germany Online &lt;PDF&gt;. 2011-03-14 from http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p91470_index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example: Messaging==
Combination services include those that integrate SMS with voice, such as voice SMS. Providers include Bubble Motion, Jott, Kirusa, and SpinVox. Several operators have launched services that combine SMS with mobile instant messaging (MIM) and presence. Text-to-landline services also exist, where subscribers can send text messages to any landline phone and are charged at standard rates. The text messages are converted into spoken language. This service has been popular in America, where fixed and mobile numbers are similar. Inbound SMS has been converging to enable reception of different formats (SMS, voice, MMS, etc.). UK companies, including consumer goods companies and media giants, should soon{{when|date=May 2011}} be able to let consumers contact them via voice, SMS, MMS, IVR, or video using one five-digit number or [[long number]]. In April 2008, O2 UK launched voice-enabled shortcodes, adding voice functionality to the five-digit codes already used for SMS. This type of convergence is helpful for media companies, broadcasters, enterprises, call centres and help desks who need to develop a consistent contact strategy with the consumer. Because SMS is very popular today, it became relevant to include [[text messaging]] as a contact possibility for consumers. To avoid having multiple numbers (one for voice calls, another one for SMS), a simple way is to merge the reception of both formats under one number. This means that a consumer can text or call one number and be sure that the message will be received.

==Example: Mobile==
"Mobile service provisions" refers not only to the ability to purchase mobile phone services, but the ability to wirelessly access everything: voice, Internet, audio, and video. Advancements in [[WiMAX]] and other leading edge technologies provide the ability to transfer information over a wireless link at a variety of speeds, distances, and non-line-of-sight conditions.

==Example: Multi-play in telecommunications==
Multi-play is a marketing term describing the provision of different telecommunication services, such as [[Internet access]], television, telephone, and mobile phone service, by organisations that traditionally only offered one or two of these services. Multi-play is a catch-all phrase; usually, the terms [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] (voice, video and data) or quadruple play (voice, video, data and wireless) are used to describe a more specific meaning. A dual play service is a marketing term for the provisioning of the two services: it can be high-speed Internet ([[digital subscriber line]]) and telephone service over a single broadband connection in the case of phone companies, or high-speed Internet ([[cable modem]]) and TV service over a single broadband connection in the case of cable TV companies. The convergence can also concern the underlying communication [[infrastructure]]. An example of this is a [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service, where communication services are packaged allowing consumers to purchase TV, Internet, and [[telephony]] in one subscription. The broadband cable market is transforming as pay-TV providers move aggressively into what was once considered the telco space. Meanwhile, customer expectations have risen as consumer and business customers alike seek rich content, multi-use devices, networked products and converged services including on-demand video, digital TV, high speed Internet, VoIP, and wireless applications. It is uncharted territory for most broadband companies.

A quadruple play service combines the [[triple play (telecommunications)|triple play]] service of broadband Internet access, television, and telephone with [[wireless]] service provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm Integrated Design for VoIP-Enabled Quadruple Play Devices] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226070457/http://www.d2tech.com/4-news/2007/07-10-29a.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This service set is also sometimes humorously referred to as "The [[Fantastic Four]]" or "Grand Slam".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|title=Cable consortium mobilizes quad-play with Sprint|work=CED|accessdate=17 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927040031/http://www.cedmagazine.com/cable-consortium-mobilizes-quad-play.aspx|archivedate=27 September 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental aspect of the quadruple play is not only the long-awaited broadband convergence but also the players involved. Many of them, from the largest global service providers to whom we connect today via wires and cables to the smallest of startup service providers are interested. Opportunities are attractive: the big three telecom services – [[telephony]], cable television, and [[wireless]]—could combine their industries. In the UK, the merger of [[Virgin Media|NTL:Telewest]] and [[Virgin Mobile]] resulted in a company offering a quadruple play of cable television, broadband Internet, home telephone, and mobile telephone services.

==Example: Home network==
Early in the 21st century, home LAN convergence so rapidly integrated home [[Router (computing)|router]]s, [[wireless access point]]s, and [[DSL modem]]s that users were hard put to identify the resulting box they used to connect their computers to their Internet service. A general term for such a combined device is a [[residential gateway]].

[[File:Doppelschluessel.jpg|thumb|The [[Berlin key]]]]
"'''The Berlin key or how to do words with things'''" is an essay  by sociologist [[Bruno Latour]], that originally appeared as ''La clef de Berlin et autres lecons d'un amateur de sciences'', La Dècouverte, in 1993. "The Berlin key or how to do words with things" was later published   as the first chapter in P.M. Graves-''Brown's Matter, Materiality and Modern Culture''. In the 15-page chapter, written informally in third-person narrative, Latour describes a common object used in Berlin, a "Berlin Key" which is constructed so that after opening leaving one's apartment house, after unlocking the street door  from the inside, one can only retrieve the key from the outside in a manner which locks the door behind oneself; upon entering, after one unlocks the door with the key, one must retrieve it from the inside, again locking the door behind oneself; this prevents leaving the door open but unlocked. The essay  is organized to expose  deftly exposes how many layers of significance a unique key can connote.&lt;ref name=Ryzewski&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryzewski|first=Krista|title=The Berlin Key|url=https://brown.edu/Departments/Joukowsky_Institute//courses/13things/7444.html|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Latour&gt;{{cite web|last=Latour|first=Bruno|title=The Berlin Key or How to Do Words with Things|url=http://www.bruno-latour.fr/sites/default/files/P-36-Berliner-KEY-GBpdf.pdf|publisher=Routledge|accessdate= 16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the P.M. Graves-Brown version, [[Lydia Davis]] translated the piece into English. Additional editing was completed and illustrations redrawn by PMGB.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt; The title could have been chosen as a witty word-play off of [[J.L. Austin]]'s ''[[How to Do Things With Words]]''.

Latour argues that while an object's purposefully designed material nature may recommend or permit a highly controlled set of functional purposes, it may also offer a broad range of valuable possibilities.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;&lt;ref name=Maycroft&gt;{{cite web|last=Maycroft|first=Neil|title=The objectness of everyday life: disburdenment or engagement?|url=http://eprints.lincoln.ac.uk/1258/1/Objects_and_Use.pdf|accessdate=5 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Latour uses the Berlin key to show that there are social constraints which force people to do whatever it is that the object makes them do; thus, the object (the Berlin key) is a sign, of sorts, telling the inhabitants to 'lock their doors at night, but never during the day.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;&lt;ref name=Ying&gt;{{cite web|last=Ying|first=Jing|title=The Berlin key|url=https://jingalex.wordpress.com/2007/09/20/the-berlin-key/|accessdate=16 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;'

Latour discusses the relationship between the social realm and the technological realm.  He asserts that the [[Sociologist]] and the Technologist are "enemy brothers", thinking they will come to an end—the sociologist with the social and the technologist with objects.&lt;ref name=Latour /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="33376">'''Wildlife observation''' is the practice of noting the occurrence or abundance of a dead or living animal [[species]] at a specific location and time.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, D. E. and R. L. Winstead, 1980. Estimating the numbers of wildlife populations. Pp. 221-247. In S.D. Schemnitz (editor). Wildlife Management and Techniques Manual. The Wildlife Society,Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; The process of scientific wildlife observation includes the reporting of what ([[diagnosis]] of the species), where ([[geographical location]]), when (date and time), who (details about observer), and why (reason for observation, or explanations for occurrence). Wildlife observation can be performed if the animals are alive, with the most notable example being face-to-face observation and live cameras, or are dead, with the primary example being the notifying of where roadkill has occurred. This outlines the basic information needed to collect data for a wildlife observation; which can also contribute to scientific investigations of distribution, habitat relations, trends, and movement of wildlife species. One example of this type of activity is [[birdwatching|bird watching.]] Wildlife observation allows for the study of organisms with minimal disturbance to their ecosystem depending on the type of method or equipment used. The use of equipment such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), more commonly known as drones, may disturb and cause negative impacts on wildlife.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hodgson|first=Jarrod C.|last2=Koh|first2=Lian Pin|date=2016-05-23|title=Best practice for minimising unmanned aerial vehicle disturbance to wildlife in biological field research|journal=Current Biology|volume=26|issue=10|pages=R404–405|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2016.04.001|issn=1879-0445|pmid=27218843}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized equipment can be used to collect more accurate data.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/policy/605fw4.html|title=605 FW 4, Wildlife Observation, Fish and Wildlife Service Manual, U.S.  Fish and Wildlife Service|website=www.fws.gov|access-date=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance==
Through wildlife observation, there are many important details that can be discovered about the environment. For instance, if a fisher in Taiwan discovers that a certain species of fish he/she frequently catches is becoming rarer and rarer, there might be a substantial issue in the water that fisher is fishing in. It could be that there is a new predator in the water that has changed the [http://nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/food-chain/ animal food chain], a source of pollution, or perhaps even a larger problem. Regardless of the reason, this process of observing animals can help identify potential issues before they become severe problems in the world.

Additionally, through animal observation, those who participate are also actively participating in the conservation of animal life. Oftentimes, the two subjects go hand-in-hand with one another because through the observation of animals, individuals are also discovering what issues animals around the world are currently facing and if there are any ways to put up a fight against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalwildlife.org|title=Global Wildlife Conservation|website=globalwildlife.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; With more observation, fewer species of animals will become extinct.

==Research==
Before one can get started observing wildlife and helping the environment, it is important to research the animal they are choosing to observe. If one simply went into the observation process and skipped the crucial process of obtaining knowledge about the animals, it would be difficult for them to determine if anything was out of the ordinary.&lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Watch-Wildlife|title=How to Watch Wildlife|newspaper=wikiHow|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before observing, it would be wise to find out simple information about the animal such as:
* What the animal eats - Is the animal a carnivore, herbivore, or omnivore?
* What animals prey on the animal?
* Where does the animal live?
* Is the animal dangerous?
* Is it endangered?
* Does the animal travel in packs or alone?
* What are the animal's sleeping habits? &lt;ref name="How to Watch Wildlife"/&gt;

==Projects and programs devoted to wildlife observation==

===Projects===
There are a variety of projects and websites devoted to wildlife observations. One of the most common projects are for bird observations (for example: [http://ebird.org e-bird]). For those who enjoy bird watching, there are a variety of ways one can contribute to this type of wildlife observation. The National Wildlife Refuge System has volunteer opportunities, citizen science projects, and if one is limiting in time; could purchase a Federal Duck Stamp that donates money to the wildlife refuge lands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fws.gov/refuges/birding/getinvolved.html|title=Get Involved {{!}} National Wildlife Refuge System|last=System|first=National Wildlife Refuge|website=www.fws.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past few years, websites dedicated to reporting wildlife across broad taxonomic ranges have become available. For example, the [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/california California Roadkill Observation System] provides a mechanism for citizen-scientists in California to report wildlife species killed by vehicles. The [http://www.wildlifecrossing.net/maine Maine Audubon Wildlife Road Watch] allows reporting of observations of both dead and live animals along roads. A more recent addition to wildlife observation tools are the web sites that facilitate uploading and management of images from remote wildlife cameras. For example, the [[Smithsonian Institution]] supports the [http://eMammal.wordpress.com eMammal] and [http://siwild.si.edu Smithsonian Wild] programs, which provide a mechanism for volunteer deployment of wildlife cameras around the world.  Similarly, the [http://wildlifeobserver.net Wildlife Observer Network] hosts over a dozen wildlife-camera projects from around the world, providing tools and a database to manage photographs and camera networks.

===Monitoring programs===
Monitoring programs for wildlife utilize new and easier ways to monitor animal species for citizen scientists and research scientists alike. One such monitoring device is the automated recorder. Automated recorders are a reliable way to monitor species such as bird, bats, and amphibians as they provide ability to save and independently identify a specific animal call.&lt;ref name="Furnas"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Furnas|first1=Brett J.|title=Using Automated Recorders and Occupancy Models to Monitor Common Forest Birds Across a Large Geographic Region|journal=Journal of Wildlife Management|date=February 2015|volume= 79|pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;325–337.|doi=10.1002/jwmg.821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The automated recorder analyzes the sounds of the species to identify the species and how many there are.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt; It was found that using the automated recorders produced larger quantity and even more quality data when compared with traditional, point-count data recording.&lt;ref name="Acevedo"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Acevedo|first1=Miguel A.and |last2=Villanueva-Rivera|first2=Luis J.|title=Using Automated Digital Recording Systems as Effective Tools for the Monitoring of Birds and Amphibians|journal=Wildlife Society Bulletin|date=2006|volume= 34 | issue = 1 |pages=pp.&amp;nbsp;211–214. |doi=10.2193/0091-7648(2006)34[211:uadrsa]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While providing better quality, it also provides a permanent record of the census which can be continually reviewed for any potential bias.&lt;ref name="Acevedo" /&gt; This monitoring device can improve wildlife observation and potentially save more animals. Using this device can allow for continued tracking of populations, continued censusing of individuals within a species, and allow for faster population size estimates.&lt;ref name="Furnas" /&gt;

==Live watching and observation==

===Birdwatching===
One of the most popular forms of wildlife observation, [[birdwatching]], is typically performed as a recreational pleasure. Those looking to birdwatch typically travel into a forest or other wooded area with a pair of binoculars in hand to aid the process. Birdwatching has become all the more important with the amount of deforestation that has been occurring in the world. Birds are arguably the most important factor in the balance of environmental [[system]]s: "They pollinate plants, disperse seeds, scavenge carcasses and recycle nutrients back into the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.audubon.org/magazine/march-april-2013/why-do-birds-matter|title=Why Do Birds Matter?|date=2013-03-06|newspaper=Audubon|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A decrease in the total number of birds would cause destruction to much of the environmental system. The plants and trees around the world would die at an alarming rate which would, in turn, set off a chain reaction that would cause many other animals to die due to the environment change and [[Habitat destruction|habitat loss]]. 
[[File:Birdwatching on beach.jpg|thumb|244x244px|Birdwatchers on a beach]]

One of the ways that birdwatching has an effect on the environment as a whole is that through consistent birdwatching, an observer would be able to identify whether they are seeing less of a certain species of bird. If this happens, there typically is a reasons for the occurrence, whether it be because of an increase in pollution in the area or possibly an increase in the population of predators.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://birding.about.com/od/birdconservation/a/importconserve.htm|title=bird wildlife conservation protect protection conserve environment|newspaper=About.com Home|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; If a watcher were to take notice of a change in what they typically see, they could notify the city or park and allow them to investigate into the cause a bit further. Through this action, birdwatchers are preserving the future for both animal and human life.

Subsequently, by taking children birdwatching it is allowing the future generation to understand the importance of animal observation. If children learn at a young age how the environmental system works and that all life is intertwined, the world will be in much better hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These children will be the ones pioneer conservation movements and attempt to protect the habit for all animals.

===Livestreams===
Live streams of animal exhibits at various zoos and aquariums across the United States have also become extremely popular. The [[Tennessee Aquarium]] has a webcam that allows online viewers to take a look into the happening so their Secret Reef exhibit which consists of reef fish, sharks, and a rescued green sea turtle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tnaqua.org/animals-exhibits/secret-reef-cam/|title=Secret Reef Cam {{!}} Tennessee Aquarium|last=Aquarium|first=Tennessee|website=www.tnaqua.org|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most popular animals cams in the United States though come from, naturally, the largest zoo in the United States: [[San Diego Zoo|The San Diego Zoo]]. The San Diego Zoo features eight live cams on their website – A panda, elephant, ape, penguin, polar bear, tiger, condor, and koala. The purpose of the live streams is to help educate the public about the behaviors of several different animals and to entertain those who might not be able to travel to a zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://zoo.sandiegozoo.org/content/video-more|title=Video &amp; More|date=2013-12-03|newspaper=San Diego Zoo|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other notable zoos that have webcams are the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]], [[Woodland Park Zoo]], [[Houston Zoo]], and [[Zoo Atlanta|Atlanta Zoo]].

Additionally, the [[National Museum of Natural History|Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History]] has opened a butterfly and plant observation pavilion. Visitors walk into a large tent and experience a one-of-a-kind situation in which hundreds of rare butterflies from all across the world are inches from their faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://naturalhistory.si.edu/butterflies/|title=Butterflies + Plants: Partners in Evolution, Home Page|website=naturalhistory.si.edu|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collecting data===
As is the case with a majority of subjects, one of the best and most effective ways to observe live animals is through data collection. This process can be done through a livestream or in the wild but it is more useful if the data is collected on animals that are in currently in the wild.&lt;ref name="study.com"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://study.com/academy/lesson/how-to-observe-measure-describe-animal-behavior.html|title=How to Observe, Measure &amp; Describe Animal Behavior {{!}} Study.com|newspaper=Study.com|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ways the data can be collected are endless and it really just depends on what purpose an individual has as to what data would be the most useful.

For example, if someone is interested in how deer interact with other animals in a certain location, it would be beneficial for them to take notes and record all of the animals that are native to the area where the deer are located. From there, they can describe any scenarios in which the deer had a positive or negative interaction with the other species of animals. In this instance, it would not really be helpful for the observer to collect data pertaining to the types of food the deer eat because the study is only focusing on the interaction amongst animals.

Another example of how collecting data on wildlife would be useful is keeping track of the total number of a certain species exists within a forest. Naturally, it will be impossible to get a definitive number but if an accurate approximation can be made, it could be beneficial in determining if there has been a random increase or decrease in the population. If there is an increase, it could be due to a change in the species migration habits and if there is a decrease, it could be due to an external factor such as pollution or introduction of a new predator.&lt;ref name="study.com"/&gt;

==Deceased wildlife observation==
[[File:Wildlife crossing.jpg|thumb|244x244px|An example of a wildlife crossing sign]]

===Online systems and mobile apps===
Many states have already begun to set up websites and systems for the public. The main purpose behind the movement is so that they can notify other individuals about [[Roadkill|road-killed]] wildlife. If enough people fill out the forms located on the websites, the government will become notified that there have been occurrences of a loss of animal life and will take the steps required to prevent it. Typically, the step that is taken is the posting of a wildlife crossing sign that, in turn, allows the public to know where there are common animal crossings. Maine and California are the states that have been the pioneers of this movement and this process has become particularly important on heavily traveled roads as no one would like endanger the animals or themselves.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net {{!}} wildlife observation reporting|website=www.wildlifecrossing.net|access-date=2016-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, there is an app (available on both iPhone and Android devices) made specifically for the purpose of identifying road-kill called [https://www.herpmapper.org/mobile/mapper “Mobile Mapper.”] The app is a partner of the HerpMapper website. The purpose of the website is to use the user recorded observations for research and conservation purposes.&lt;ref name="wildlifecrossing.net|title=wildlifecrossing.net"/&gt;

On average, the cost of repairing a car that has been damaged by a deer or other medium to large-sized animal is $2,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though there is no way that accidents involving animals can completely be prevented, placing more signs about possible animal crossings zones would cause drivers to drive more carefully and therefore have fewer accidents. Economically, this means that more families will be saving money and it could be used in a different way to help contributed to society as a whole.

==Issues leading to the extinction of animals==

===Climate change===
[[Climate change]] is one of the most heavily discussed topics around the world today, both politically and scientifically. The climate that Earth is currently experiencing has been steadily changing over time due to both natural causes and human exploitation.&lt;ref name="Media"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/global-warming/climate-change-and-animals.html|title=Climate change - effects on animals|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change has the potential to be detrimental to wildlife across the world, whether that be through rising sea levels, changes in temperatures through the years, or [[deforestation]].&lt;ref name="Media"/&gt; These are just a few of the examples of the contributing factors to climate change.

Climate change is not something that citizens can entirely prevent from happening even if they wanted to. There are many natural causes such as [[Volcano|volcanic activity]] and the Earth's orbit around the sun that are strong contributing factors to the phenomena.&lt;ref name="Canada"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=65CD73F4-1|title=climatechange.gc.ca - Facts on Climate Change - Causes of Climate Change|last=Canada|first=Government of Canada, Environment and Climate Change|website=www.climatechange.gc.ca|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are, however, prevention measures that can be taken to prevent climate change from happening as quickly. The primary way to prevent climate change is for society to reduce the amount of [[greenhouse gas]]es that are present in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Canada"/&gt; This can be done through the improving of energy efficiency in many buildings, the stoppage of deforestation so more carbon dioxide can be removed from the atmosphere, and mode switching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cehtp.org/faq/climate_change/preventing_and_preparing_for_climate_change|title=Climate Change|website=cehtp.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rising sea levels====
One of the more notable effects climate change has on the environment is the rising of sea levels around the world. Over the past 100 years, the sea level has risen approximately 1.8 millimeters each year.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.actforlibraries.org/the-impact-of-rising-sea-levels-on-animal-life/|title=The Impact of Rising Sea Levels on Animal Life {{!}} Actforlibraries.org|website=www.actforlibraries.org|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The steady rise in sea levels can be attributed to the steadily increasing temperatures the Earth faces each year which causes the ice caps and glaciers to melt.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; This increase in sea level is detrimental to the [[Coast|coastal ecosystems]] that exist around the world.
[[File:Polar bear after unlucky hunt for a seal.jpg|thumb|Polar bear hunting for food]]
The increase in sea level causes flooding on coastal wetlands, where certain animals will be unable to survive due to [http://eden.cce.cornell.edu/disasters/Documents/PDFs/saltwater%20innundation%20fact%20sheet.pdf saltwater inundation].&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt; The increase in the total amount of saltwater present in these wetlands could prove to be problematic for many species. While some may simply have to migrate to other areas, smaller ecosystems within the wetlands could be destroyed which, once again, influences the animal food chain.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Polar bear]]s are animals that are specifically affected through the process of rising sea levels. Living near the Arctic region, polar bears find their food on ice caps and sheets of ice. As these sheets continue to become fewer in quantity, it is predicted that the polar bears will have a difficult time sustaining life and that by the year 2050, there could be less than 20,000 on Earth.&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;

[[Coral reef]]s are the primary ecosystem that would be affected through a continuing increase in the sea level:&lt;blockquote&gt;"The coral reef ecosystem is adapted to thrive within certain temperature and sea level range. Corals live in a symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic [[zooxanthellae]]. Zooxanthellae need the sunlight in order to produce the nutrients necessary for the coral. Sea level rise may cause a decrease in solar radiation at the sea surface level, affecting the ability of photosynthetic zooxanthellae to produce nutrients for the coral, whereas, a sudden exposure of the coral reef to the atmosphere due to a low tide event may induce coral bleaching."&lt;ref name="actforlibraries.org"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Coral reefs with fishes.JPG|thumb|Coral reef with fish]]
The loss of coral would have a subsequent effect on the total number of fish that exist within these ecosystems. In the Indo-Pacific coral reefs alone, there are in-between 4000 and 5000 different species of fish that have a relationship with the species of coral.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eatlas.org.au/content/relationship-between-corals-and-fishes-great-barrier-reef|title=Relationship between corals and fishes on the Great Barrier Reef {{!}} eAtlas|website=eatlas.org.au|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the numerous different species of [[Butterflyfish|butterfly fish]] that feed on coral within these reefs would be affected if the coral was unable to live due to an increase in sea level.&lt;ref name="eatlas.org.au"/&gt; Referring back to the food chain topic, this would then subsequently but directly affect species of snappers, eels, and sharks that use butterfly fish as a primary source of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://a-z-animals.com/animals/butterfly-fish/|title=Butterfly Fish (Chaetodontidae) - Animals - A-Z Animals - Animal Facts, Information, Pictures, Videos, Resources and Links|last=A-Z-Animals.com|website=a-z-animals.com|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the snappers cannot find any butterfly fish to eat because the butterfly fish are dying due to the lack of coral, it means that the snapper population will decrease as well.

The rising of sea level has the possibility to be catastrophic to the coastal ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-coastal-areas|title=Climate Impacts on Coastal Areas|last=EPA,OA|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pollution===
[[Pollution]] is another crucial threat to animal life, and human life, across the world. Every form of pollution has an effect on wildlife, whether it be through the air, water, or ground. While sometimes the origin and form of pollution is visible and easy to determine, other times it can be a mystery as to what exactly is causing the death of animals. Through constant and consistent observation of habitat analysis, humans can help prevent the loss of animal life by recognizing the early signs of pollution before the problem becomes too large.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ocean and water pollution====
[[File:Deepwater Horizon oil spill fishing closure map 2010-06-02.png|thumb|Map of the area where fishing was affected because of the BP oil spill]]
Pollution can enter bodies of water in many different ways - Through toxic runoff from pesticides and fertilizers, containers of oil and other hazardous materials falling off of ships, or just from debris  from humans that has not been picked up.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.worldwildlife.org/threats/pollution|title=Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF|website=World Wildlife Fund|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; No matter what the form of pollution is, the effects water pollution has on animal life can be drastic. For example, the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|BP oil spill]] which occurred in 2010 impacted over 82,000 birds, 6,000 sea turtles, approximately 26,000 marine animals, and hundreds of thousands of fish.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/programs/public_lands/energy/dirty_energy_development/oil_and_gas/gulf_oil_spill/a_deadly_toll.html|title=A Deadly Toll|website=www.biologicaldiversity.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the observation of how animal life was and has been affected by this spill is unique and definitely on the larger scale, it still represents an accurate depiction of how observation can be crucial to animal lives. For example, by observing that a certain species of sea turtle was affected by the oil spill, zoologists and their teams would be able to determine the effects the loss of that sea turtle would have.&lt;ref name="A Deadly Toll"/&gt;

Another prominent example is how if one day a fisherman goes to a lake that he/she frequently visits and notices two or three dead fish on the surface. Knowing that that frequently does not happen, the fisherman tells his local city officials and park rangers about the occurrence and they find out that a farmer has been using a new pesticide that runs off into the lake. By simply observing what is common and what is not, the effects of some water pollution can be stopped before becoming too severe.

====Air pollution====
[[File:Pollution de l'air.jpg|thumb|Smoke coming from a factory]]
Air pollution is commonly associated with the image of billowing clouds of smoke rising into the sky from a large factory. While the fumes and smoke previously stated definitely is a prominent form of air pollution, it is not the only one. Air pollution can come from the emission of cars, smoking, and other sources.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Air pollution does not just affect birds though, like one may have thought. Air pollution affects mammals, birds, reptiles, and any other organism that requires oxygen to live.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; Frequently, if there is any highly dangerous air pollution, the animal observation process will be rather simple: There will be an abundance of dead animals located near the vicinity of the pollution.

The primary concern of air pollution is how widespread the pollution can become in a short period of time. [[Acid rain]] is one of the largest forms of pollution today. The issue with acid rain is that it affects literally every living organism it comes in contact with, whether that be trees in a forest, water in an ocean or lake, or the skin of humans and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.climateandweather.net/world-weather/acid-rain.html|title=Acid Rain|last=Media|first=Ali Penman {{!}} Web Smart|website=www.climateandweather.net|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, acid rain is a combination of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that are emitted from factories.&lt;ref name="Pollution {{!}} Threats {{!}} WWF"/&gt; If it is not controlled in a timely manner, it could lead to loss of life due to the dangerous nature of the composition of the rain.

===Deforestation===
Deforestation has become one of the most prevalent issues environmentally. With an continuously growing population and not having the space to contain all the humans on Earth, forests are frequently the first areas that are cleared to make more room.&lt;ref name="Society"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://environment.nationalgeographic.com/environment/global-warming/deforestation-overview/|title=Deforestation Facts, Deforestation Information, Effects of Deforestation - National Geographic|last=Society|first=National Geographic|newspaper=National Geographic|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to National Geographic, forests still cover approximately 30 percent of the land on Earth but each year large portions are cleared.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

With deforestation, there are numerous subsequent side effects. Most notably, the clearing of entire forests (in some instances) destroys the habitat for hundreds of species of animals and 70 percent of the animals that reside in the forest will die as a result.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, deforestation causes a reduction in the total [[Canopy (biology)|canopy cover]] which leads to more extreme temperature swings on the ground level because there are no branches and leaves to catch the sun's rays.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

The way to combat the severe effects on the loss of animal life would be to stop cutting trees and forests down. While this is unlikely and almost impossible to happen, there is another solution: the partial removal of forests. By only removing portions of the forest, it keeps the environment of the entire forest in tact which allows the animals to adapt to their surroundings.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt; Additionally, it is recommended that for every tree that is cut down that another one be planted elsewhere in the forest.&lt;ref name="Society"/&gt;

==Economic effects of animal observation==

===Costs of observation===
Typically, the costs of animal observation are minuscule. As previously stated, animal observation can be done on a small or large scale; it just depends what goal an individual has in mind. For example, animal observation can be performed in the backyard of a house or at a local state park at no charge. All one would have to do is take a notepad, phone, or other device to write down their data and observations. On a larger scale, animal observation could be performed at an animal reserve, where the associated costs would be those associated with keeping the animals happy inside the reserve.

While it is impossible to pinpoint exactly how much the zoos across the world spend on live streaming, it is estimated to be in the $1,000 range for every camera that is set up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://livestream.com/platform/pricing|title=Livestream {{!}} Plans &amp; Pricing|website=Livestream|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs that observation prevents===
Referring back to the example from the "Deceased Wildlife Observation" section, it becomes apparent how animal observation can save families and the government money. With the average cost of repairing a car that has damage from a large sized animal being $2,000, families and the government could save money by making the public aware that they should proceed with caution in areas where animals have been hit.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hcn.org/issues/291/15268|title=Roadkill statistics|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pollution in Maracaibo lake.jpg|thumb|298x298px|Water pollution at Maracaibo lake]]
Additionally, approximately $44 million of the $4.3 billion spent on water purity is spent each year on protecting aquatic species from nutrient pollution.&lt;ref name="Roadkill statistics"/&gt; It is encouraging that the government is willing to spend the money to help save animals' lives, sometimes the effects of the pollution take effect before they are able to stop them entirely.  One million seabirds and hundred thousand aquatic mammals and fish that are killed as a result of water pollution each year and that has its economic effects, both directly and indirectly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dosomething.org/us/facts/11-facts-about-pollution|title=11 Facts About Pollution {{!}} DoSomething.org {{!}} Volunteer for Social Change|website=www.dosomething.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Directly, the loss of aquatic mammals and fish has a direct impact on the sales of food. The EPA estimated recently that the effects of pollution cost the fishing industry tens of millions of dollars in sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/nutrientpollution/effects-economy|title=The Effects: Economy|last=EPA,OW,OWOW|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indirectly, the loss of birds causes humans to spend more money on pest control because the food chain is out of order.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.whatdobirdseat.info|title=What do Birds Eat?|website=www.whatdobirdseat.info|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small rodents and insects that some birds prey upon are no longer being killed if the birds die. This means more of these pests find their ways into homes which causes more people to call exterminators, therefore setting off a chain reaction. The exterminators then must use insecticides to kill the animals which can have harmful runoff into the ground and local water systems, instead of allowing it to be done naturally by the animal food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.toxicsaction.org/problems-and-solutions/pesticides|title=The Problem with Pesticides {{!}} Toxics Action Center|website=www.toxicsaction.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
