'''Action Transfers''', also known as '''rub-on transfers''', were an art-based children's pastime that was extremely popular throughout the world from the 1960s to the 1980s. They consisted of a printed [[Corrugated fiberboard|cardboard]] background image and a transparent sheet of coloured [[dry transfer]] figures of people, animals, vehicles, weapons, explosions and so on. These transfers were supposed to be applied to the background scene by rubbing the top surface of the transparent sheet with a hard object or stylus; typically, this would mean a ball-point pen or a pencil; the figure would thereby be transferred from its sheet to the background. Since it was not customary to determine exactly where the transfers should be applied, surreal or comic effects could be achieved—whether deliberately or inadvertently—by juxtaposing the transfers and the background inappropriately. It was also possible to apply the transfer figures elsewhere than on the supplied background, and conversely it is quite common to come across finished transfer sets in which the descriptive lettering from the sheets has been applied to the background; an effect not intended by the manufacturer.

A number of different sets were distributed by a wide variety of companies between the late 1960s and the 1980s; these included sets based on popular comics and cartoons (e.g., [[DC Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]], [[Hanna Barbera]], and [[Walt Disney|Disney]] cartoons), television series and movies (e.g., ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica]]''), as well as original content sets. Since Letraset had a patent monopoly on the dry rub-down transfer process, until the end of the 1970s any transfers supplied with these sets would have been printed by Letraset, firstly at [[Waterloo Road, London|Waterloo Road]] in [[London]], then later at [[Ashford, Kent|Ashford]] in [[Kent]], and finally at their factory in [[Italy]].

==History==
[[Image:Letraset-boegen.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Typographic character sheets made by Letraset (left) and similar product made by a rival (right).]]
[[Letraset]], the company that developed the [[Instant Lettering]] transfer sheets that dominated design and publishing before the advent of [[desktop publishing]], created the first dry rub-down transfer sets for children and marketed them as "[[Instant Pictures]]" in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The First Instant Pictures|url=http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_ranges/busybees_linking.shtml|website=www.action-transfers.com/|publisher=Action Transfers|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were originally [[silk screen]] printed and monochromatic, but by 1966 they were being produced using four spot colours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Panoramas|url=http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_ranges/panoramas_linking.shtml|website=www.action-transfers.com/|publisher=Action Transfers|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Instant Pictures after 1965 were produced for either [[John Waddington Ltd.]] or [[Patterson Blick]].

Letraset purchased a [[rotary gravure]] press which they installed at Ashford in Kent, and there they produced true full-colour transfers for the first time starting in 1967. These were not strictly [[CMYK]] colour transfers, because white ink is also required—since transfers are printed on transparent plastic, and not on white paper.

In 1969 the first Action Transfer sets were produced in this way, initially with a range of twelve sets—although the range rapidly expanded. Letraset stopped using the title "Instant Pictures" and from then on referred to their own transfers as "Action Transfers", even if they were not actually in the range of sets originally given that name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_a/chronology.shtml Action Transfers: the Chronology]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, the production of Action Transfers was transferred to Letraset's Italian factory, [[Sodecor]], where offset litho printing was used with transfers for the first time. The impetus for the move was a joint venture undertaken with [[Gillette (brand)|Gillette]] to produce Action Transfers under the name Kalkitos. These were widely distributed around the world, with the brand name occasionally differing; in the US, they were known as [[Presto Magix]].

After the acquisition of Letraset by [[Esselte]] in 1981, the production of transfers was continued by a British company named [[Acorn Printed Products]], that was formed by several ex-Letraset staff members. Acorn still produce transfers to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Acorn Printed Products|url=http://www.action-transfers.com/html/a_ranges/acorn.shtml|website=www.action-transfers.com|publisher=Action Transfers|accessdate=23 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Agate Bowl''' ({{lang-de|Achatschale}}) is a bowl cut out of a single piece of [[agate]] in the fourth century at the court of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]], and now displayed in the [[Imperial Treasury (Vienna)|Imperial Treasury]] at the [[Hofburg Palace]] in [[Vienna]], Austria.&lt;ref name="leithe"&gt;Leithe-Jasper 2004, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries it was widely regarded as the "greatest masterpiece" and the "best and most important piece" in the collection.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"&gt;Kunsthistorisches Museum 1991, pp. 111–14.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1564, Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian II]] and his brothers declared it by deed to be an "inalienable heirloom of the house of Austria".&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt; They valued this ancient precious stone carving, not just for its craftsmanship, but for a "natural miracle" in the stone itself that reveals a mysterious inscription—the name ''XRISTO'' (''Christ'') at the bottom of the bowl within the grain of the stone.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt; It is now generally believed that the inscription inspired the legend that the bowl was the [[Holy Grail]]. The Agate Bowl is the largest carved stone bowl in the world.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt;

==Description==
The Agate Bowl is 76 cm (30 in) wide including the handles.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt; The bowl is cut from a single, massive block of [[agate]], the largest carved stone bowl in the world.&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt;

==History==
The Agate Bowl dates from the fourth century and is believed to have been created at the court of [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]]. Its first documented reference is in a deed from 1564 written by Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximillian II]] and his brothers, declaring the bowl to be an "inalienable heirloom of the house of Austria",&lt;ref name="leithe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt; to be owned by the entire [[House of Habsburg]]. In 1619, an inventory of the estate of Holy Roman Emperor [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] records, "the word KRISTO is to be seen in quite large letters in the nature of the stone".&lt;ref name="kunst"/&gt;

From the seventeenth to the twentieth century, documented descriptions of an inscription ''B.XRISTO.RI.XXPP'' was seen as a reference to [[Jesus Christ]]. Because the writing seemed to be neither painted nor carved in the bowl, but appeared in the natural veining of the stone itself, the Agate Bowl was regarded a relic, even considered to be the [[Holy Grail]].

In 1951, after the relic was [[Antiques restoration|restored]], the inscription was reinterpreted by art historian Rudolf Egger to read ''ARISTO'', the name of the stone cutter. Others believe the inscription is in fact an optical illusion.

'''Alfred William Parsons''' [[Royal Academician|RA]] (2 December 1847 &amp;ndash; 16 January 1920) was an English artist: [[illustrator]], [[landscape painter]] and [[garden designer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gardenofpraise.com/artprint51.htm Biography] (gardenofpraise.com).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.racollection.org.uk/ixbin/indexplus?_IXSESSION_=Lwm0RD8l9u6&amp;_IXSR_=&amp;_IXACTION_=display&amp;_MREF_=10367&amp;_IXSP_=1&amp;_IXFPFX_=templates/full/&amp;_IXSPFX_=templates/full/&amp;_IXTRAIL_=Academicians Orange Lillies] (Royal Academy of Arts Collections).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?did=1&amp;uin=uk.bl.ethos.390316 Parsons' biography] (British Library).&lt;/ref&gt;

Alfred Parsons was well known for his English [[landscape painting]]s and fine [[botanical illustration]]s which brought him into contact with [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]], for whom he provided illustrations. He regularly exhibited his art work from 1868 to 1919.  He also artistically designed significant gardens mostly in England and some in Scotland and the United States. Parsons and his contemporaries believed that an artist could design better gardens. He won the Chantrey Bequest in 1887 and the published his book ''Notes From Japan'' in 1896. Parsons became President of the [[Society of Painters in Watercolours]] in 1905, and among many other works, he illustrated [[Ellen Willmott]]'s ''The Genus Rosa''. He was a keen [[gardener]] and for the last six years of his life took care of his roses at Luggershill, [[Broadway, Worcestershire]], England.

Alfred Parsons was born in [[Beckington]]&lt;ref&gt;Beckington Parish Register Baptism, Ancestry.co.uk (February 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; near [[Frome]], Somerset, the son of Dr Joshua Parsons, a surgeon and dedicated gardener of [[alpine plant|alpines]] and correspondent of [[William Robinson (gardener)|William Robinson]],&lt;ref&gt;Marion Mako, "Painting with nature in Broadway, Worcestershire", ''Journal of the Garden History Society'' '''34'''.1 (Summer 2006:47-63), p. 47, 49..&lt;/ref&gt; and raised in London. After being educated privately, he started work as a clerk in the [[General Post Office|Post Office]] in 1867. After two years, he left the unsuitable desk-job to pursue studies at the [[Royal College of Art|Kensington School of Art]], and went on to exhibit at various galleries including the [[Grosvenor Gallery]] and the [[Royal Academy]], where he exhibited every year from 1874 to the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Mako 2006:48.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons, whose interest in "Englishness"&lt;ref&gt;Mako 2006: "The Cult of Englishness" pp48ff.&lt;/ref&gt; paralleled the tastes of upper-class American émigrés, joined the notable artistic community in the village of [[Broadway, Worcestershire|Broadway]] in the [[Cotswolds]] ([[Worcestershire]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://jssgallery.org/Essay/Broadway/Broadway.htm Broadway] (Worcestershire); Marion Mako, "Painting with nature in Broadway, Worcestershire", ''Journal of the Garden History Society'' '''34'''.1 (Summer 2006:47-63), examines painterly effects in some gardens designed by Parsons for friends in the Broadway circle.&lt;/ref&gt; His associates included the American artists [[Francis Davis Millet]], who remained Parson's closest friend until he drowned aboard the ''[[RMS Titanic|Titanic]]'', and  [[Edwin Austin Abbey]], with whom he collaborated in illustrated books. Through American contacts made while at the artists' colony he became an illustrator for ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harpers.org/subjects/AlfredParsons ''Harper's Magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; and also provided illustrations for books&amp;nbsp;– including short stories by [[Thomas Hardy]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://victorian.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/victorianweb/art/illustration/hardyshortfiction/index.html Illustrated Thomas Hardy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100408114444/http://victorian.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/victorianweb/art/illustration/hardyshortfiction/index.html |date=2010-04-08 }} (Victorian Web).&lt;/ref&gt; and travel books (see below). [[Henry James]] noted that Parson's images of English country life mirrored the aspirations of Americans:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Was it there&lt;ref&gt;In America.&lt;/ref&gt; that Mr. Parsons learned so well how Americans would like England to appear? ...The England of his pencil... is exactly the England that the American imagination, restricted to itself, constructs from the poets, the novelists, from all the delightful testimony it inherits".&lt;ref&gt;James, "Our artists in Europe", ''Harper's Magazine'', '''79''' (June 1889), quoted in Mako 2006:49.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The three men, Parsons, Millet and Abbey, lived together and entertained sociably at 54, [[Bedford Gardens, London|Bedford Gardens]], London.&lt;ref&gt;Parsons gave it up in 1914 (Mako 2006:59).&lt;/ref&gt; William Robinson asked him to provide illustrations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=William|title=The Wild Garden|year=1903|publisher=John Murray|location=London|pages=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; for ''The Wild Garden: Or, Our Groves and Shrubberies Made Beautiful by the Naturalisation of Hardy Exotic Plants'' (1881, the 1903-5th edition being the best one) led to Robinson's invitation for Parsons to lend advice at his [[Gravetye Manor]]. Several artists engraved Parsons' illustrations. As it was the custom, he never engraved himself. Parsons' first garden commission, however, came through the architect [[Philip Webb]], who was designing [[Clouds House|Clouds]] in Wiltshire for [[Percy Wyndham (1835–1911)|Mr and Mrs Percy Wyndham]], prominent figures among the aesthetic-minded group called "[[The Souls]]": Parsons provided an unostentatious planting of spring bulbs, ''[[Magnolia × soulangeana]]'', roses and lilies, in a framework of clipped yews, wedding new and old elements.&lt;ref&gt;Mako 2006:52.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parsons' long-lasting association with the Anglo-American group centred in Broadway, began in 1885, when Parsons and his London friends rented a house facing the Green, where [[John Singer Sargent]] began painting ''[[Carnation, Lily, Lily, Rose]]''. Parsons first made a garden for himself and his friends at Russell House facing the Evesham road at the western entrance to Broadway, then a garden setting for [[Mary Anderson (stage actress)|Mary Anderson, Mrs Antonio de Navarro]] at Court Farm (1896 onwards) and later for himself, at Luggershill (1903 onwards).

Parsons' fine illustrated book, his only published text, ''Notes in Japan'' (London, 1895, reprinted) came from his visit to that country between 1892 and 1894.

[[Ellen Willmott]]'s ''The Genus Rosa'', published in two volumes between 1910 and 1914,&lt;ref name ="BBC"&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Forgotten Gardeners {{ndash}} Ellen Willmott|series = [[Woman's Hour]]| url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/womanshour/03/2007_13_fri.shtml| network = [[BBC]]| station = [[BBC Radio 4]]| airdate = 30 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes 132 watercolours of roses painted by  Parsons between 1890 and 1908, which are now held by the [[Lindley Library]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stuart Thomas, OBE|first=Graham|title=A Garden of Roses|year=1987|publisher=Pavilion Books Limited|location=London|isbn=1-85145-059-9|pages=160}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Willmott also commissioned Parsons to paint her three gardens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hobhouse and Wood|first=Penelope and Christopher|title=Painted Gardens.

As a designer of gardens, Parsons went into partnership in 1898 with Captain Walter Croker St-Ives Partridge (1855—1924), as Parsons and Partridge of Newbury, Berkshire. In 1884 they took into the partnership Charles Clement Tudway (1846—1926).&lt;ref&gt;Nicole Milette, ''Parsons, Partridge, Tudway: an unsuspected garden design partnership, 1884-1914'' (York : Institute of Advanced Architectural Studies, University of York) 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Parson's  restorations of old gardens and designs of sympathetic settings for old houses can be appreciated at 15th-century [[Great Chalfield Manor]] and at Elizabethan  [[Littlecote House]], both in Wiltshire. Alfred Parsons and Walter Partridge also worked on the gardens at [[Welbeck Abbey]], 1899—1905 and at [[Bryngarw Country Park|Bryngarw]], Glamorganshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.coflein.gov.uk/pdf/CPG195/ |title=CADW/ICOMOS Register of Landscapes, Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in Wales: Brygarw |access-date=2011-10-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031221312/http://www.coflein.gov.uk/pdf/CPG195/ |archive-date=2014-10-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An early essay was [[Wightwick Manor]], a reproduction black-and-white house, for which Parsons provided the garden in 1887.

== History ==

In 1893, a group of American [[architect]]s, [[Painting|painters]] and [[sculptor]]s met regularly while planning the fine arts section of the [[1893 World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]]. The group discussed the idea of forming an American school for artists in Europe as a place for American artists to study and further their skills. Led by [[Charles Follen McKim|Charles F. McKim]] of architectural practice [[McKim, Mead &amp; White]], they decided that Rome, which they considered a veritable museum of masterpieces of painting, sculpture and architecture throughout the ages, would be the best location for the school. The program began with institutions such as [[Columbia University]] and [[University of Pennsylvania]], who would provide scholarships to artists to fund their travel to Rome. In October 1894 the American School of Architecture opened temporarily at the [[Palazzo Torlonia]]; directed by [[Austin W. Lord]], it had three fellows, one visiting student, and a library with one volume. In July 1895, the program moved into the larger Villa Aurora. Renting space out to the American School of Classical Studies and the British &amp; American Archeological Society Library, and financial contributions from McKim, allowed for the school to remain open.&lt;ref name="AAA"&gt;{{cite web | author=| year=2011 | title=Finding Aid | work=American Academy in Rome records, 1855-[ca.1981], (bulk dates 1894-1946) | publisher=[[Archives of American Art]] | url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/american-academy-rome-records-6320/more | accessdate=17 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895, the American School of Architecture in Rome was [[Incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in [[New York (state)|New York]] state and 10 shares of [[capital stock]] were issued. Despite fund-raising efforts and the American School of Classical Studies pulling out of Villa Aurora, the organization struggled financially. McKim made up for the financial loss with his personal funds. These struggles would cause the American School of Architecture to restructure and base their program on the [[French Academy in Rome|French Academy]]. In June 1897, the institution dissolved itself and formed the American Academy in Rome.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; Among its incorporators was [[Charles Moore (businessman)|Charles Moore]].&lt;ref&gt;Caemmerer, H. Paul. "Charles Moore and the Plan of Washington." ''Records of the Columbia Historical Society.'' Vol. 46/47 (1944/1945): 237-258, 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy introduced bills to the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] to make it a "national institution," which was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn Brown [http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015030974136;seq=9;view=1up;num=I ''1860-1930: Memories''] (Washington DC, 1931), pp. 425-28)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, the Academy moved into Villa Mirafiore, which was soon purchased and renovated. They formed an [[Financial endowment|endowment]], which raised over a million dollars, designating those having donated over $100,000 as founders. These founders included: McKim, [[Harvard College]], [[Carnegie Corporation of New York|The Carnegie Foundation]], [[J.P. Morgan]], [[J.P. Morgan, Jr.]], [[John D. Rockefeller, Jr.]], [[The Rockefeller Foundation]], [[William K. Vanderbilt]], [[Henry Walters]], and others.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; Ever since, the American Academy has always been primarily privately financed.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Jean Nathan (June 9, 1994), [https://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/garden/in-rome-renovation-worthy-of-the-medici.html In Rome, Renovation Worthy of the Medici] ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, financing comes from private donations as well as grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]] and the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/04/11/arts/american-academy-gives-1991-rome-prizes.html American Academy Gives 1991 Rome Prizes] ''The New York Times'', April 11, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, the American School of Classical Studies in Rome merged with the Academy, giving the Academy two wings: one that focuses on [[fine art]] and one, [[classical studies]]. Women were a part of the School of Classical Studies, but were not permitted participation in the School of Fine Arts until after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; Since 1914, [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Aaron Copland]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Mary McCarthy (author)|Mary McCarthy]], [[Philip Guston]], [[Frank Stella]], [[William Styron]], [[Michael Graves]], [[Robert Venturi]], [[Robert Penn Warren]], [[Oscar Hijuelos]] and [[Elizabeth Murray (artist)|Elizabeth Murray]], among others, have come to the Academy for inspiration.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The [http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/32510561 ''Centennial Directory of the American Academy in Rome''] documented the lives and careers of nearly 1,400 Fellows and Residents of the Academy from the Academy's founding in 1894 to its centenary in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;American Academy in Rome., Kohl, B.

== Programs ==
The Academy serves as a "home" to visiting U.S. scholars and artists having been awarded the [[Rome Prize]]. Given each year to up to 30 (15 artist and 15 scholars) of more than 1,000 applicants,&lt;ref&gt;http://cdn.aarome.org/html-emails/pdf/AARMagazine_Spring2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the Rome Prize is awarded for work in the following fields: [[classical studies]], [[ancient|ancient studies]], [[Medieval|medieval studies]], modern [[Italian culture|Italian]] studies, [[architecture]], [[design]], [[historic preservation]], [[art conservation]], [[landscape architecture]], [[musical composition]], [[visual art]], and [[literature]]. The Rome Prize includes terms that range from six months to two years fellowships at the academy; a stipend ($16,000 for six month and $28,000 for one year fellowships); and work and living space at the 11-acre campus.

In addition to Rome Prize Fellows, visiting scholars and artists live and/or work at the Academy for varying periods.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;

== Site ==

The Academy is housed in several buildings.  The main building was designed by the firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] and opened in 1914. Located under the floor of the basement of the main building lies a segment of the [[Aqua Traiana]] that was discovered in 1912-1913.[https://www.jstor.org/pss/4238499] The courtyard has a fountain designed by sculptor [[Paul Manship]]. Architect [[Michael Graves]] designed the rare books library in 1996.

The Academy also owns the ''[[Villa Aurelia]]'',&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt; a country estate built for [[Cardinal Girolamo Farnese]] in 1650.  The building served as [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]'s headquarters during the French siege of Rome in 1849.  The villa was heavily damaged during the assault, but it was restored.  It was then purchased by [[Philadelphia]] heiress [[Clara Jessup Heyland]].  Heyland died in 1909, bequeathing the villa to the Academy in her will.&lt;ref name="AAA"/&gt;

==Archaeology==
A portion of the [[Roman aqueduct|aqueduct]] [[Aqua Traiana]] and the ruins of the [[watermills]] fed by the aqueduct are on the grounds of the Academy.  From the third to the sixth century CE, the Aqua Traiana carried water to operate a number of water mills used for grinding grain, mostly wheat, into flour to make bread, the most important item in the Roman diet. The ancient city of Rome had to import large amounts of grain from [[Egypt]], [[North Africa]], and [[Sicily]] to feed its population, estimated at about one million people at its peak. The mills on Janiculum Hill and on the site of the Academy were the second largest complex of water mills known in the ancient world. The provision of grain to the residents of Rome was called the [[Cura Annonae]]. The aqueduct and the watermills were excavated in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Andrew (2000), "The Water-Mills on the Janiculum", ''Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome,'' Vol. 45, pp. 219-246.

{{French literature sidebar}}
'''Georges André Malraux''' [[Distinguished Service Order|DSO]] ({{IPA-fr|ɑ̃dʁe malʁo|lang}}; 3 November 1901 – 23 November 1976) was a French novelist, art theorist and [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Cultural Affairs]]. Malraux's novel ''La Condition Humaine'' ([[Man's Fate]]) (1933) won the [[Prix Goncourt]]. He was appointed by President [[Charles de Gaulle]] as Minister of Information (1945–46) and subsequently as France's first Minister of Cultural Affairs during de Gaulle's presidency (1959–69).

==Early years==
Malraux was born in Paris in 1901, the son of Fernand-Georges Malraux (1875-1930) and Berthe Félicie Lamy (1877-1932). His parents separated in 1905 and eventually divorced. There are suggestions that Malraux's paternal grandfather committed suicide in 1909.&lt;ref name=MalrauxWebsite&gt;[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html "Biographie détaillée"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505042043/http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html |date=5 May 2011 }}, André Malraux Website, accessed 3 Sep 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux was raised by his mother, maternal aunt Marie Lamy and maternal grandmother, Adrienne Lamy (née Romagna), who had a grocery store in the small town of [[Bondy]].&lt;ref name=MalrauxWebsite/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a stockbroker, committed suicide in 1930 after the international [[Stock market crash|crash of the stock market]] and onset of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;  From his childhood, associates noticed that André had marked nervousness and motor and vocal tics. The recent biographer Olivier Todd, who published a book on Malraux in 2005, suggests that he had [[Tourette's syndrome]], although that has not been confirmed.&lt;ref name=Knorr&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/31/style/31iht-malraux_ed3_.html?pagewanted=1| title=Andre Malraux, the Great Pretender| author=Katherine Knorr| date= 31 May 2001| work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Either way, most critics have not seen this as a significant factor in Malraux's life or literary works.

The young Malraux left formal education early, but he followed his curiosity through the booksellers and museums in Paris, and explored its rich libraries as well.

[[File:Banteay Srei - Cambodia.jpg|thumb|The [[Banteay Srei]] temple was the subject of a celebrated case of [[art theft]] when André Malraux stole four devatas in 1923 (he was soon arrested and the figures returned).]]

==Career==

===Early years===
Malraux's first published work, an article entitled "The Origins of Cubist Poetry", appeared in the magazine ''Action'' in 1920. This was followed in 1921 by three semi-surrealist tales, one of which, "Paper Moons", was illustrated by Fernand Léger. Malraux also frequented the Parisian artistic and literary milieux of the period, meeting figures such as [[Demetrios Galanis]], [[Max Jacob]], [[François Mauriac]], [[Guy de Pourtalès]], [[André Salmon]], [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Raymond Radiguet]], [[Florent Fels]], [[Pascal Pia]], [[Marcel Arland]], [[Edmond Jaloux]], and [[Pierre Mac Orlan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html Biographie détaillée] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110505042043/http://www.malraux.org/index.php/biographie/biodetaillee.html |date=5 May 2011 }}. Malraux.org. Retrieved on 1 August 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, Malraux married [[Clara Malraux|Clara Goldschmidt]]. Malraux and his first wife separated in 1938 but didn't divorce until 1947. His daughter from this marriage, Florence (b. 1933), married the filmmaker [[Alain Resnais]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 388–389&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of twenty, Malraux was reading the work of the German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] who was to remain a major influence on him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name="Batchelor pages 218-229"&gt;Batchelor, R "The Presence of Nietzsche in André Malraux" pages 218-229 from ''Journal of European Studies'', Issue 3, 1973 page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux was especially impressed with Nietzsche's theory of a world in continuous turmoil and his statement "that the individual himself is still the most recent creation" who was completely responsible for all of his actions.&lt;ref name="Batchelor pages 218-229"/&gt; Most of all, Malraux embraced Nietzsche's theory of the ''[[Übermensch]]'', the heroic, exalted man who would create great works of art and whose will would allow him to triumph over anything.&lt;ref&gt;Batchelor, R "The Presence of Nietzsche in André Malraux" pages 218-229 from ''Journal of European Studies'', Issue 3, 1973 page 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indochina===
The British Colonel [[T. E. Lawrence]], aka "Lawrence of Arabia", holds a sinister reputation in France as the man who was supposedly responsible for France's troubles in Syria in the 1920s. An exception was Malraux who regarded Lawrence as a role model, the intellectual-cum-man of action and the romantic, enigmatic hero.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 218.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux often admitted to having a "certain fascination" with Lawrence, and it has been suggested that Malraux's sudden decision to abandon the Surrealist literary scene in Paris for adventure in the Far East was prompted by a desire to emulate Lawrence who began his career as an archaeologist in the Ottoman Empire excavating the ruins of the ancient city of [[Carchemish]] in the ''vilayet'' of Aleppo in what is now modern Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 218-219.&lt;/ref&gt; As Lawrence had first made his reputation in the Near East digging up the ruins of an ancient civilization, it was only natural that Malraux should go to the Far East to likewise make his reputation in Asia digging up ancient ruins.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 219.&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence considered himself a writer first and foremost while also presenting himself as a man of action, the ''Nietzschean'' hero who triumphs over both the environment and men through the force of his will, a persona that Malraux consciously imitated.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 219-220.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux often wrote about Lawrence, whom he described admiringly as a man with a need for "the absolute", for whom no compromises were possible and for whom going all the way was the only way.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from pages 222-223.&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, Malraux argued that Lawrence should not be remembered mainly as a guerrilla leader in the Arab Revolt and the British liaison officer with the Emir Faisal, but rather as a romantic, lyrical writer as writing was Lawrence's first passion, which also described Malraux very well.&lt;ref name="Roak pages 218-224"&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Malraux courted fame through his novels, poems and essays on art in combination with his adventures and political activism, he was an intensely shy and private man who kept to himself, maintaining a distance between himself and others.&lt;ref name="Langlois 1976 pages 683-687"&gt;Langlois, Walter "André Malraux (1901-1976)" pages 683-687 from ''The French Review'', Vol. 50, No. 5, April 1977 page 685.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux's reticence led his first wife Clara to later say she barely knew him during their marriage.&lt;ref name="Langlois 1976 pages 683-687"/&gt;

In 1923, aged 22, Malraux and Clara left for the [[French Protectorate of Cambodia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 53–58&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angkor Wat]] is a huge 12th century Hindu temple situated in the old capital of the Khmer empire. Angkor ([[Yasodharapura]]) was "the world's largest urban settlement" in the 11th and 12th centuries supported by an elaborate network of canals and roads across mainland Southeast Asia before decaying and falling into the jungle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Upon reaching Cambodia, Malraux, Clara and friend Louis Chevasson undertook an expedition into unexplored areas of the former imperial settlements in search of hidden temples, hoping to find artifacts and items that could be sold to art collectors and museums. At about the same time archaeologists, with the approval of the French government, were removing large numbers of items from Angkor - many of which are now housed in the [[Guimet Museum]] in Paris. On his return, Malraux was arrested and charged by French colonial authorities for removing a ''[[bas-relief]]'' from the exquisite ''[[Banteay Srei]]'' temple. Malraux, who believed he had acted within the law as it then stood, contested the charges but was unsuccessful.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.academia.edu/1247202/Hierarchies_of_value_at_Angkor_Wat Hierarchies of value at Angkor Wat | Lindsay French].

Malraux's experiences in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] led him to become highly critical of the French colonial authorities there. In 1925, with Paul Monin,&lt;ref&gt;Yves Le Jariel, L'ami oublié de Malraux en Indochine, Paul Monin (1890-1929)&lt;/ref&gt; a progressive lawyer, he helped to organize the [[Young Annam League]] and founded a newspaper ''[[L'Indochine]]'' to champion Vietnamese independence.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 86–96&lt;/ref&gt; After falling afoul of the French authorities, Malraux claimed to have crossed over to China where he was involved with the [[Kuomintang]] and their then allies, the Chinese Communists in their struggle against the warlords in the Great Northern Expedition before they turned on each other in 1927, which marked the beginning of the Chinese Civil War that was to last on and off until 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Roak, Denis "Malraux and T. E. Lawrence" pages 218-224 from ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 61, No. 2, April 1966 from page 220.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Malraux did not first visit China until 1931 and he did not see the bloody suppression of the Chinese Communists by the Kuomintang in 1927 first-hand as he often implied that he did, although he did do much reading on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Anne Lijing ''The Sublime Writer and the Lure of Action: Malraux, Brecht, and Lu Xun on China and Beyond'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2007 page 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Asian novels===
On his return to France, Malraux published ''[[The Temptation of the West]]'' (1926). The work was in the form of an exchange of letters between a Westerner and an Asian, comparing aspects of the two cultures. This was followed by his first novel ''The Conquerors'' (1928), and then by ''The Royal Way'' (1930) which reflected some of his Cambodian experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; The American literary critic Dennis Roak described ''Les Conquérants'' as influenced by ''The Seven Pillars of Wisdom'' as it was narrated in the present tense "...with its staccato snatches of dialogue and the images of sound and sight, light and darkness, which create a compellingly haunting atmosphere."&lt;ref name="Roak pages 218-224"/&gt; ''Les Conquérants'' was set in the summer of 1925 against the backdrop of the general strike called by the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and Kuomintang in Hong Kong and Canton, the novel concerns political intrigue amongst the "anti-imperialist" camp.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 45"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is narrated by an unnamed Frenchman who travels from Saigon to Hong Kong to Canton to meet an old friend named Garine who is a professional revolutionary working with [[Mikhail Borodin]], who in real life was the Comintern's principle agent in China.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 45"/&gt; The Kuomintang are depicted rather unflatteringly as conservative Chinese nationalists uninterested in social reform, another faction is led by Hong, a Chinese assassin committed to revolutionary violence for the sake of violence, and only the Communists are portrayed relatively favorably.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 46"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the dramatic tension between the novel concerns a three-way struggle between the hero, Garine and Borodin who is only interested in using the revolution in China to achieve Soviet foreign policy goals.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 46"/&gt; The fact that the European characters are considerably better drawn than the Asian characters reflected Malraux's understanding of China at the time more of an exotic place where Europeans played out their own dramas rather than a place to be understood in its own right. Initially, Malraux's writings on Asia reflected the influence of "[[Orientalism]]" presenting the Far East as strange, exotic, decadent, mysterious, sensuous and violent, but Malraux's picture of China grew somewhat more humanized and understanding as Malraux disregarded his Orientalist and Eurocentric viewpoint in favor of one that presented the Chinese as fellow human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Xu, Anne Lijing ''The Sublime Writer and the Lure of Action: Malraux, Brecht, and Lu Xun on China and Beyond'', New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 2007 pages 11 &amp; 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second of Malraux's Asian novels was the semi-autobiographical [[The Royal Way|''La Voie Royale'']] which relates the adventures of a Frenchman Claude Vannec who together with his Danish friend Perken head down the royal road of the title into the jungle of [[Cambodia]] with the intention of stealing bas-relief sculptures from the ruins of Hindu temples.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 69.&lt;/ref&gt; After many perilous adventures, Vannec and Perken are captured by hostile tribesmen and find an old friend of Perken's  Grabot who has already been captured for some time.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Grabot, a deserter from the French Foreign Legion has been reduced to nothing as his captors have blinded him and left him tied to a stake starving, a stark picture of human degradation.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"/&gt; The three Europeans escape, but Perken is wounded and dies of an infection.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"/&gt; Through ostensibly an adventure novel, ''La Voie Royale'' is in fact a philosophical novel concerned with existential questions about the meaning of life.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 70"/&gt; The book was a failure at the time as the publishers marketed it as a stirring  adventure story set in far-off, exotic Cambodia which confused many readers who instead found a novel pondering deep philosophical questions.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his Asian novels, Malraux used Asia as a stick to beat Europe with, as he argued that after World War I, the ideal of progress, of a Europe getting better and better for the general advancement of humanity was dead.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 561&lt;/ref&gt; As such, Malraux now argued that European civilization was faced with a ''Nietzschean'' void, a twilight world without God or progress, in which the old values had proven worthless and a sense of spirituality that had once existed was gone.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; An agnostic, but an intensely spiritual man, Malraux maintained what was needed was an "aesthetic spirituality" in which love of art and civilization would allow one to appreciate ''le sacré'' in life, a sensibility that was both tragic and awe-inspiring as one surveyed all of the cultural treasures of the world, a mystical sense of humanity's place in a universe that was as astonishingly beautiful as it was mysterious.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; Malraux argued that as death is inevitable and in a world devoid of meaning, which thus was "absurd", only art could offer meaning in an "absurd" world.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"&gt;Sypher, Wylie "Aesthetic of Doom: Malraux" pages 146-165 from ''Salmagundi'', No. 68/69, Fall 1985-Winter 1986 page 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux argued that art transcended time as art allowed one to connect with the past, and the very act of appreciating art was itself an act of art as the love of art was part of a continuation of endless artistic metamorphosis that constantly creating something new.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"/&gt; Malraux argued that as different types of art went in and out of style, the revival of a style was a metamorphosis as art could never be appreciated in exactly the same way as it was in the past.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"/&gt;  As art was timeless, it conquered time and death as artworks lived on after the death of the artist.&lt;ref name="Sypher pages 146-165"/&gt; The American literary critic Jean-Pierre Hérubel wrote that Malraux never entirely worked out a coherent philosophy as his mystical ''Weltanschauung'' (world view) was based more upon emotion than logic.&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; In Malraux's viewpoint, of all the professions, the artist was the most important as artists were the explorers and voyagers of the human spirit as artistic creation was the highest form of human achievement for only art could illustrate humanity's relationship with the universe as Malraux wrote "there is something far greater than history and it is the persistence of genius".&lt;ref name="Hérubel pages 556-575"/&gt; Hérubel argued that it is fruitless to attempt to criticize Malraux for his lack of methodological consistency as Malraux cultivated a poetical sensibility, a certain lyrical style that appealed more to the heart than to the brain.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 562&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux was a proud Frenchman, but he also saw himself as a citizen of the world, a man who loved the cultural achievements of all of the civilizations across the globe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; At the same time, Malraux criticized those intellectuals who wanted to retreat into the ivory tower, instead arguing that it was the duty of intellectuals to participate and fight (both metaphorically and literally) in the great political causes of the day, that the only truly great causes were the ones that one was willing to die for.&lt;ref name="Langlois 1976 pages 683-687"/&gt;

In 1933 Malraux published ''[[Man's Fate]]'' (''La Condition Humaine''), a novel about the 1927 [[Shanghai massacre of 1927|failed Communist rebellion in Shanghai]]. Despite Malraux's attempts to present his Chinese characters as more three dimensional and developed than he did in ''Les Conquérants'' , his biographer Oliver Todd wrote he could not "quite break clear of a conventional idea of China with coolies, bamboo shoots, opium smokers, destitutes, and prostitutes", which were the standard French stereotypes of China at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Todd, Oliver ''Malraux: A Life'', New York: Alfred Knopf, 2005 page 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The work was awarded the 1933 [[Prix Goncourt]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 170–181&lt;/ref&gt; After the breakdown of his marriage with Clara, Malraux lived with journalist and novelist [[Josette Clotis]], starting in 1933. Malraux and Josette had two sons: Pierre-Gauthier (1940–1961) and Vincent (1943–1961). During 1944, while Malraux was fighting in [[Alsace]], Josette died, aged 34, when she slipped while boarding a train. His two sons died together in 1961 in an automobile accident.

===Searching for lost cities===
On 22 February 1934, Malraux together with [[Édouard Corniglion-Molinier]] embarked on a much publicized expedition to find the lost capital of the [[Queen of Sheba]] mentioned in the Old Testament.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 118"&gt;Harris, Geoffrey ''André Malraux: A Reassessment'', London: Macmillan 1995 page 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi Arabia and Yemen were both remote, dangerous places that few Westerners visited at the time, and what made the expedition especially dangerous was while Malraux was searching for the lost cities of Sheba, King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia invaded Yemen, and the ensuing Saudi–Yemeni war greatly complicated Malraux's search.&lt;ref&gt;Langlois, Walter ''In search of Sheba: an Arabian adventure : André Malraux and Edouard Corniglon-Molinier, Yemen, 1934'' Knoxville: Malraux Society, 2006 pages 267-269&lt;/ref&gt; After several weeks of flying over the deserts in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, Malraux returned to France to announce that ruins he found up in the mountains of Yemen were the capital of the Queen of Sheba.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 118"/&gt; Through Malraux's claim is not generally accepted by archeologists, the expedition bolstered Malraux's fame and provided the material for several of his later essays.&lt;ref name="Harris, Geoffrey page 118"/&gt;

===Spanish Civil War===
During the 1930s, Malraux was active in the anti-fascist [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] in France. At the beginning of the [[Spanish Civil War]] he joined the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] forces in Spain, serving in and helping to organize the small Spanish Republican Air Force.&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 228–242&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis Cate, one of his biographers, writes that Malraux was slightly wounded twice during efforts to stop the Battle of [[Madrid]] in 1936 as the Spanish Nationalists attempted to take Madrid, but the historian [[Hugh Thomas, Baron Thomas of Swynnerton|Hugh Thomas]] argues otherwise.

The French government sent aircraft to Republican forces in Spain, but they were obsolete by the standards of 1936. They were mainly [[Potez 540]] bombers and [[Dewoitine D.372]] fighters. The slow Potez 540 rarely survived three months of air missions, flying at 160 knots against enemy fighters flying at more than 250 knots. Few of the fighters proved to be airworthy, and they were delivered intentionally without guns or [[sight (device)|gunsights]]. The Ministry of Defense of France had feared that modern types of planes would easily be captured by the German [[Condor Legion]] fighting with General [[Francisco Franco]], and the lesser models were a way of maintaining official "neutrality".&lt;ref&gt;Cate, p. 235&lt;/ref&gt; The planes were surpassed by more modern types introduced by the end of 1936 on both sides.

The Republic circulated photos of Malraux standing next to some Potez 540 bombers suggesting that France was on their side, at a time when France and the United Kingdom had declared official neutrality. But Malraux's commitment to the Republicans was personal, like that of many other foreign volunteers, and there was never any suggestion that he was there at the behest of the French Government. Malraux himself was not a pilot, and never claimed to be one, but his leadership qualities seem to have been recognized because he was made Squadron Leader of the 'España' squadron. Acutely aware of the Republicans' inferior armaments, of which outdated aircraft were just one example, he toured the United States to raise funds for the cause. In 1938 he published ''[[Man's Hope|L'Espoir]]'' (Man's Hope), a novel influenced by his Spanish war experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n15/john-sturrock/the-man-from-nowhere| title=The Man from Nowhere| author=John Sturrock| work=The London Review of Books| volume= 23| number= 15 | date= 9 August 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux's participation in major historical events such as the Spanish Civil War inevitably brought him determined adversaries as well as strong supporters, and the resulting polarization of opinion has colored, and rendered questionable, much that has been written about his life. Fellow combatants praised Malraux's leadership and sense of camaraderie&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009). pp. 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[André Marty]] of the [[Comintern]] called him as an "adventurer" for his high profile and demands on the Spanish Republican government.&lt;ref name="Beevor, p. 140"&gt;Beevor, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The British historian [[Antony Beevor]] also claims that "Malraux stands out, not just because he was a mythomaniac in his claims of martial heroism – in Spain and later in the French Resistance – but because he cynically exploited the opportunity for intellectual heroism in the legend of the Spanish Republic."&lt;ref name="Beevor, p. 140"/&gt; Both these claims are highly questionable. Malraux's only work about the Spanish Revolution was a novel – in which he does not figure at all. His later works occasionally describe episodes during the Resistance&lt;ref&gt;Mainly the first volume of his ''Antimémoires''.&lt;/ref&gt; but in none of them does he make anything resembling "claims of martial heroism". Indeed, in one episode, he portrays himself in a somewhat unflattering light.

In any case, Malraux's participation in events such as the Spanish Civil War has tended to distract attention from his important literary achievement. Malraux saw himself first and foremost as a writer and thinker (and not a "man of action" as biographers so often portray him) but his extremely eventful life – a far cry from the stereotype of the French intellectual confined to his study or a Left Bank café – has tended to obscure this fact. As a result, his literary works, including his important works on the theory of art, have received less attention than one might expect, especially in Anglophone countries.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, ''Art and the Human Adventure, André Malraux's Theory of Art'' (Rodopi, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War II===
At the beginning of the [[Second World War]], Malraux joined the [[French Army]]. He was captured in 1940 during the [[Battle of France]] but escaped and later joined the [[French Resistance]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 278–287&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, he was captured by the [[Gestapo]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 328–332&lt;/ref&gt; He later commanded the [[Brigade Alsace-Lorraine]] in defence of [[Strasbourg]] and in the attack on [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;Cate, pp. 340–349&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Otto Abetz]] was the German Ambassador, and produced a series of "black lists" of authors forbidden to be read, circulated or sold in Nazi occupied France. These included anything written by a Jew, a communist, an Anglo-Saxon or anyone else who was anti-Germanic or anti-fascist. [[Louis Aragon]] and André Malraux were both on these "Otto Lists" of forbidden authors.&lt;ref&gt;Moorehead, Caroline. 2011. A Train in Winter. Pages 21-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, Malraux was awarded the ''[[Médaille de la Résistance]]'' and the [[Croix de guerre 1939–1945|Croix de guerre]]. The British awarded him the [[Distinguished Service Order]], for his work with British liaison officers in [[Corrèze]], Dordogne and [[Lot (department)|Lot]]. After Dordogne was liberated, Malraux led a battalion of former resistance fighters to [[Alsace-Lorraine]], where they fought alongside the [[First Army (France)|First Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documentsonline/details-result.asp?Edoc_Id=7792088|title=Recommendations for Honours and Awards (Army)—Malraux, Andre|work=DocumentsOnline|publisher=[[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]]|format=fee usually required to view full pdf of original recommendation|accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the war, he worked on his last novel, ''The Struggle with the Angel'', the title drawn from the story of the Biblical [[Jacob]]. The manuscript was destroyed by the Gestapo after his capture in 1944. A surviving first section, titled ''The Walnut Trees of Altenburg'', was published after the war.

===After the war===

Mrs. Kennedy described Malraux as "the most fascinating man I've ever talked to".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/12/us/12jackie.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | first=Janny | last=Scott | title=In Oral History, Jacqueline Kennedy Speaks Candidly After the Assassination | date=11 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Shortly after the war, General [[Charles de Gaulle]] appointed Malraux as his Minister for Information (1945–1946). Soon after, he completed his first book on art, ''The Psychology of Art'', published in three volumes (1947–1949). The work was subsequently revised and republished in one volume as ''The Voices of Silence'' (''Les Voix du Silence''), the first part of which has been published separately as ''The Museum without Walls''. Other important works on the theory of art were to follow. These included the three-volume ''Metamorphosis of the Gods'' and ''Precarious Man and Literature'', the latter published posthumously in 1977. In 1948, Malraux married a second time, to [[Marie-Madeleine Lioux]], a concert pianist and the widow of his half-brother, Roland Malraux. They separated in 1966. Subsequently, Malraux lived with [[Louise de Vilmorin]] in the Vilmorin family château at Verrières-le-Buisson, Essonne, a suburb southwest of Paris. Vilmorin was best known as a writer of delicate but mordant tales, often set in aristocratic or artistic milieu. Her most famous novel was ''Madame de...'', published in 1951, which was adapted into the celebrated film ''[[The Earrings of Madame de…]]'' (1953), directed by Max Ophüls and starring Charles Boyer, Danielle Darrieux and Vittorio de Sica. Vilmorin's other works included ''Juliette'', ''La lettre dans un taxi'', ''Les belles amours'', ''Saintes-Unefois'', and ''Intimités''. Her letters to Jean Cocteau were published after the death of both correspondents. After Louise's death, Malraux spent his final years with her relative, Sophie de Vilmorin.

In 1957, Malraux published the first volume of his trilogy on art entitled ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods''. The second two volumes (not yet translated into English) were published shortly before he died in 1976. They are entitled ''L'Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'' and discuss artistic developments from the Renaissance to modern times. Malraux also initiated the series ''[[Arts of Mankind]]'', an ambitious survey of world art that generated more than thirty large, illustrated volumes.

When de Gaulle returned to the French presidency in 1958, Malraux became France's first [[Minister of Culture (France)|Minister of Cultural Affairs]], a post he held from 1958 to 1969. On 7 February 1962, Malraux was the target of assassination attempt by the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS) who set off a bomb to his apartment building that failed to kill its intended target, but did leave a four-year girl living in the adjoining apartment blinded by the shrapnel.&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Todd ''The Invention of Decolonization: The Algerian War and the Remaking of France'' Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 2008 page 183.&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Malraux was a lukewarm supporter of de Gaulle's decision to grant [[Évian Accords|independence to Algeria]], but the OAS was not aware of this, and had decided to assassinate Malraux as a high-profile minister.

Among many initiatives, Malraux launched an innovative (and subsequently widely imitated) program to clean the blackened façades of notable French buildings, revealing the natural stone underneath.&lt;ref&gt;Chilvers, Ian.  Entry for AM in ''The Oxford Dictionary of Art'' (Oxford, 2004).  Accessed on 6/28/11 at: http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Andre_Malraux.aspx#4&lt;/ref&gt;  He also created a number of ''maisons de la culture'' in provincial cities and worked to preserve France's national heritage by promoting [[industrial archaeology]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 557&lt;/ref&gt; An intellectual who took the arts very seriously, Malraux saw his mission as Culture Minister to preserve France's heritage and to improve the cultural levels of the masses.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 pages 556-557&lt;/ref&gt; Malraux's efforts to promote French culture mostly concerned renewing old or building new libraries, art galleries, museums, theatres, opera houses, and ''maisons de la culture'' (centres built in provincial cities that were a mixture of a library, art gallery and theatre).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Film, television and music took less of Malraux's time, and the changing demographics caused by immigration from the Third World stymied his efforts to promote French high culture, as many immigrants from Muslim and African nations did not find French high culture that compelling.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; A passionate bibliophile, Malraux built up a huge collections of books both as a cultural minister for the nation and as a man for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 page 558&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux was an outspoken supporter of the Bangladesh liberation movement during the 1971 [[Pakistani Civil War]] and despite his age seriously considered joining the struggle. When [[Indira Gandhi]] came to Paris in November 1971, there was extensive discussion between them about the situation in Bangladesh.

During this post-war period, Malraux published a series of semi-autobiographical works, the first entitled ''Antimémoires'' (1967). A later volume in the series, ''Lazarus'', is a reflection on death occasioned by his experiences during a serious illness. ''La Tête d'obsidienne'' (1974) (translated as ''Picasso's Mask'') concerns Picasso, and visual art more generally. In his last book, published posthumously in 1977, ''L'Homme précaire et la littérature'', Malraux propounded the theory that there was a ''bibliothèque imaginaire'' where writers created works that influenced subsequent writers much as painters learned their craft by studying the old masters; once they have understood the work of the old masters, writers would sally forth with the knowledge gained to create new works that added to the growing and never-ending  ''bibliothèque imaginaire''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An elitist who appreciated what he saw as the high culture of all the nations of the world, Malraux was especially interested in art history and archaeology, and saw his duty as a writer to share what he knew with ordinary people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; An aesthete, Malraux believed that art was spiritually enriching and necessary for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Hérubel, Jean-Pierre "André Malraux and the French Ministry of Cultural Affairs: A Bibliographic Essay" pages 556-575 from ''Libraries &amp; Culture'', Vol. 35, No. 4 Fall 2000 pages 557-558&lt;/ref&gt;

Malraux died in [[Créteil]], near Paris, on 23 November 1976. He was buried in the [[Verrières-le-Buisson]] (Essonne) cemetery. In recognition of his contributions to French culture, his ashes were moved to the [[Panthéon, Paris|Panthéon]] in Paris during 1996, on the twentieth anniversary of his death.

There is now a large and steadily growing body of critical commentary on Malraux's literary ''œuvre'', including his very extensive writings on art. Unfortunately, some of his works, including the last two volumes of ''The Metamorphosis of the Gods'' (''L'Irréel'' and ''L'Intemporel'') are not yet available in English translation.  Malraux's works on the theory of art contain a revolutionary approach to art that challenges the Enlightenment tradition that treats art simply as a source of "aesthetic pleasure". However, as French writer [[André Brincourt]] has commented, Malraux's books on art have been "skimmed a lot but very little read"&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan, Art and the Human Adventure: André Malraux's Theory of Art, Amsterdam: Rodopi, 2009, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; (this is especially true in Anglophone countries) and the radical implications of his thinking are often missed. A particularly important aspect of Malraux's thinking about art is his explanation of the capacity of art to transcend time. In contrast to the traditional notion that art endures because it is timeless ("eternal"), Malraux argues that art lives on through metamorphosis – a process of resuscitation (where the work had fallen into obscurity) and transformation in meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Derek Allan.

Other show bibles are used as sales documents to help a [[television network]] or [[television studio|studio]] understand a series, and are sometimes given to new writers when they join the writing staff for the same reason.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt; These types of bibles discuss the backstories of the main characters and the history of the series' fictional universe.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

Television series often rely on writers' assistants and [[script coordinator]]s to serve as "walking bibles" in remembering details about a series.&lt;ref name="Jane"/&gt;

'''Licensing''' means renting or leasing of an [[intangible asset]]. It is a process of creating and managing [[contracts]] between the owner of a [[brand]] and a company or individual who wants to  use the brand in association with a product, for an agreed period of time, within an agreed territory. Licensing is used by brand owners to extend a [[trademark]] or character onto products of a completely different nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Integrated Intellectual Asset Management|first= Steve|last= Manton|year=2005|publisher=Gower Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=0-566-08721-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of intangible assets include a song ("Somewhere Over The Rainbow"), a character ([[Donald Duck]]), a name ([[Michael Jordan]]), or a brand (The [[Ritz-Carlton]]). An arrangement to license a brand requires a licensing agreement. A licensing agreement authorizes a company which markets a product or service (a licensee) to lease or rent a brand from a brand owner who operates a licensing program (a licensor).&lt;ref name="Brand Licensing Expert"&gt;[http://www.brandlicensingexpert.com BrandLicensingExpert.com Peter Canalichio, Licensing Brands, Inc. CEO]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Brand licensing is a well-established business, both in the area of [[patent]]s and trademarks. Trademark licensing has a rich history in American business, largely beginning with the rise of mass entertainment such as the movies, comics and later television. [[Mickey Mouse]]'s popularity in the 1930s and 1940s resulted in an explosion of toys, books, and consumer products with the lovable rodent's likeness on them, none of which were manufactured by the Walt Disney Company.

This process accelerated as movies and later television became a staple of American business. The rise of brand licensing did not begin until much later, when corporations found that consumers would actually pay money for products with the logos of their favorite brands on them. [[McDonald's]] play food, [[Burger King]] T-shirts and even ghastly [[Good Humor]] Halloween costumes became commonplace. [[Brand extension]]s later made the brand licensing marketplace much more lucrative, as companies realized they could make real dollars renting out their equity to manufacturers. Instead of spending untold millions to create a new brand, companies were willing to pay a royalty on net sales of their products to ''rent'' the product of an established brand name. [[Armor All]] auto vacuums, [[Breyers]] yogurt, [[TGI Friday's]] frozen appetizers, and [[Lucite]] nail polish are only a handful of the products carrying well-known brand names which are made under license by companies unrelated to the companies who own the brand.

== Reasons for licensing ==
A company may choose to license its brand(s) when they believe there is strong consumer acceptance for [[brand extensions]] or products. For example, when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] launched the iPod there was an immediate need for accessories such as headphones, charging and syncing stations and carrying cases. Apple decided not to manufacture these products and instead chose to have a [[licensee]] make the products. By doing so, Apple could offer branded "Earbud Headphones", "iPod docking stations" and "iPod socks." Each is made by a separate company but together offer the consumer an elegant solution. All of these accessories are sold by licensees.

Apart from benefits to licensors, there are benefits to licensees as well. Licensees lease the rights to a brand for incorporation into their [[merchandise]], but do not share ownership in it. Having access to major national and global brands, and the logos and trademarks associated with those brands, gives the licensee significant benefits. The most important of these is the marketing power the brand brings to the licensee’s products. When brand managers enter or extend into new product categories via licensing they create an opportunity for a licensee to grow their company. Below is an example of the licensed product process steps:

* Licensor chooses the product categories to be licensed   
* Licensor finds and negotiates a license with the best licensees   
* Licensees develop concepts, prototypes and final production samples and submit for approval   
* Licensor approves licensed products for sale   
* Licensees sell licensed products to authorized retailers&lt;ref name="Marketing Professors"&gt;[http://www.marketingprofs.com/authors/971/pete-canalichio MarketingProfessors.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Licensees expect that the license will provide them with sales growth. This sales growth may be in the form of growth within existing market or the opportunity to enter a new market. To achieve this, licensees expect that the brand they are licensing has significant brand preference, that it will open doors and ultimately help them meet or exceed their business objectives. The licensing contract forces the licensee to achieve certain sales targets and royalties; therefore, the goal of the licensee is to quickly meet their business objectives, thereby achieving their contract obligations. [[Royalties]] are the monies paid to a licensor by the licensee for the right to use the licensed property. It is calculated by multiplying the Royalty Rate by the Net Sales.&lt;ref name="Atlanta Business Radio"&gt;[http://atlantabusinessradio.businessradiox.com/atlanta-business-radio-interviews-swine-flu-expert-dr-elaina-george-brand-licensing-expert-pete-canalichio-and-batteries-plus-owner-john-cyphers/ Atlanta Business Radio Interview]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global brand licensing industry ==

The main international [[professional association]] for brand licensing is the [[Licensing Industry Merchandiser's Association]], which sponsors the annual Licensing International Expo.

The Society of Product Licensors Committed to Excellence  (SPLiCE) is a Licensors Community of Practice with the vision to continuously improve brand licensing. The mission of SPLiCE is to act as a community of licensors who share best practices for protecting, promoting and enhancing brand integrity. The SPLiCE Licensors Workshop acts as its annual board of directors and members' meeting. During SPLiCE Licensors Workshop, benchmark findings and industry trends are highlighted in feature panel presentations that are relevant to the community at large. They engage a creativity philosophy of divergence and convergence to sustain unique idea implementation on best practices. The vision for SPLiCE Licensors Workshop is to provide best in practice licensing education through sharing educational best practices through benchmarking initiatives, task force collaborations, committee reports, and guest industry speakers

Each May, ''License! Global'' magazine publishes an annual list of "The Top 150 Global Licensors". For 2017, the leader was [[Disney Consumer Products]] with $53 billion in retail sales of licensed merchandise, followed by [[Meredith Corp.]] with $23.2 Billion and [[PVH (company)|PVH]] with $18 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anonymous|title=Top 150 Global Licensors|url=http://www.licensemag.com/license-global/top-150-global-licensors-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the International Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association (LIMA), global licensed merchandise sales was $272.2 billion in 2016, versus $262.2 billion in 2015. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Stone |first=Michael |last2=Ames |first2=Allison |url=http://adage.com/article/agency-viewpoint/licensing-expo-2017-8-trends-263-billion-industry/309209/ |title=8 Trends Ahead for the $263 Billion Licensing Industry |work=[[Advertising Age]] |date=2017-06-01 |accessdate=2017-06-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Brand licensing in India ==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2013}}
The liberalisation of the Indian economy in 1992 brought a slew of international brands to India. Many of these brands have been licensed to Indian companies. [[Arvind_(company)| Arvind]] represent Arrow, Cherokee, ELLE, Nautica, USPA, AEROPOSTALE, CHILDRENS PLACE, Ed Hardy, GAP and Kipling. The [[Murjani Group]] is the licensee for Calvin Klein Jeans, FCUK and Tommy Hilfiger. Beverly Hills Polo Club (BHPC) is licensed to Spencers Retail. 

Character Licensing is another big licensing segment of brand licensing in India. The big players in the character licensing industry in India are [[Disney India]], [[Viacom 18]] and [[Cartoon Network Enterprises]]. Characters licensed out by Disney India include [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Donald Duck]]. Viacom has brought in popular characters from [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] like [[Dora The Explorer]] and [[SpongeBob SquarePants]]. Cartoon Network boasts of a portfolio including characters such as [[Ben 10]], [[Powerpuff Girls]], [[Mr. Bean]], [[Roll no. 21]], [[We Bare Bears]].

== Brand licensing in Italy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2013}}
Brand Licensing in [[Italy]] started in the seventies with very few Licensing Agencies. Apart from Disney which had its own dedicated office in the market, all the other big Entertainment majors were represented by independent agencies. One of these companies named DIC 2 (Distribution International Characters), founded in 1973 by Gianfranco Mari contributed to create the licensing business in Italy and set big phenomena as [[He-Man]] and the Masters of the Universe, [[Marvel Comics]], ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[Hanna &amp; Barbera]] characters, [[Zorro]], [[Asterix]] and so on. DIC 2 is still one of the biggest independent agencies in Italy, representing different cartoon characters and famous brands.

'''Brazilian Academic art''' was a major [[Style (visual arts)|art style]] in [[Brazil]] from the early 19th century to the early 20th century, based on European [[academic art]] and produced on official institutions of professional art education.&lt;ref name="Eul"&gt;{{harvnb|Eulálio|1984-85|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian academic art was not affiliated with only one [[art movement]], but rather with several different ones during its course. At first, it was part of the [[Neoclassicism]] movement, being one of its main forces of local diffusion. Later, it also incorporated the [[romanticism]], [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] movements, as well as others that were typical of the 20th century turn, while cleansing them of any characteristic that did not fit academic formality.&lt;ref name="Biscardi"&gt;{{harvnb|Biscardi|Rocha|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main official institution of Brazilian academic art was the [[Escola Real de Ciências, Artes e Ofícios]] (Royal School of Sciences, Arts and Crafts), founded in 1816 by [[Dom João VI]], later renamed Academia Imperial de Belas Artes (Imperial Academy of Fine Arts) and finally Escola Nacional de Belas Artes (National School of Fine Arts). Its incorporation by the [[Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro]] (Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro), in 1931, marks the end of the academic art style in Brazil. Even so, the vibrant legacy of Brazilian academic art remains significant until present day.&lt;ref name="Biscardi" /&gt;

Academic Art can also refer, in a broader sense, to any art produced under influence of [[academies]] and universities, at any time. In this sense, Brazilian academic art survived the emergence of [[modernism]] and other 20th-century art trends and continued after 1931, and thus contemporary Brazilian art schools and universities can be considered direct successors of the Escola Real de Ciências, Artes and Ofícios and the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Amaral|1998|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=LHuZVkUgsP8C&amp;pg=PA197&amp;dq=academismo&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA60,M1 60]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Beginnings===
[[File:Debret-djoaovi-mcm.jpg|thumb|[[Debret]]: ''Dom João VI in Crowning Garment'', 1816, [[Museu Nacional de Belas Artes (Brasil)|Museu Nacional de Belas Artes]]]]

The [[Missão Artística Francesa]] (French Artistic Mission) arrived in Brazil in 1816 proposing the creation of an art academy modeled after the respected Académie des Beaux-Arts, with graduation courses both for artists and craftsmen for activities such as [[Model (art)|modeling]], [[Decorative arts|decorating]], [[carpentry]] and others.

[[Joachim Lebreton]], the leader of the Missão and founder of the project, determined the schedule of classes, course structure and assessment criteria. Moreover, he was also responsible for suggesting public employment for the graduates, ways to expand public collections and determining the human and material resources needed to run the school.

This proposal, immediately welcomed by Dom João VI, led to the founding of the Escola Real de Ciências Artes e Ofícios. However, the Escola would face serious practical difficulties in its start and would take at least ten years to get into operation permanently, leading to its reopening on November 5, 1826, in the presence of [[Emperor Dom Pedro I]], as the Academia Imperial de Belas Artes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Denis|2000|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=FGTF47gkM78C&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=academy+brazil&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;as_pt=ALLTYPES#PPA53,M1 56–57]}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the founding of the Escola were created the initial conditions for the birth of academic art in Brazil, and both Brazilian academic art and the Escola would be inextricably linked.

The time that can be called contemporary in [[Turkish literature]] falls in the period between the middle of the 20th century and the first years of the new millennium. Throughout this period many changes in literary discourse have occurred. Together with the fall of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and foundation of the [[Turkish Republic]] brought a different way to Turkish literature together with the effect of [[Westernization]] on Turkish writers. The literature of the new republic emerged largely from the pre-independence National Literature movement, with its roots simultaneously in the Turkish folk tradition and in the Western notion of progress. One important change to Turkish literature was enacted in 1928, when Mustafa Kemal initiated the creation and dissemination of a modified version of the [[Latin alphabet]] to replace the Arabic-based Ottoman script. Over time, this change—together with changes in [[Turkey]]'s system of [[education]]— would lead to more widespread [[literacy]] in the country. In 1950s, Turkish authors started to write in the tone of their western contemporaries bringing a new sense of literature to the country.

All of the salient aspects of Turkish life, politics and culture have found their direct or indirect expression in poetry, fiction, and drama, as well as in critical and scholarly writing. The themes and concerns have included nationalism, social justice, search for modernity. Westernization, revival of folk culture, economic and technological progress, human dignity, mysticism, pluralistic society, human rights and fundamental freedoms, democratic ideals, Ataturkism, Turanism, Marxist-Lenist ideology, revival of Islam, humanism in fact all aspect and components of contemporary culture found a voice in literature.

All stages of modern Turkish history (reforms under Atatürk, 1923–38; consolidation under Inonu, 1938–59; democracy under Menderes, 1950–60) have been marked by the thrust of literary modernization. Since the mid-nineteenth century, the most vital debate of Turkish literature has been between the proponents of art for art's sake and the advocates of commitment to realism and social causes. Mustafa Kemal in a conversation that took place in 1921, about two years before he proclaimed the Republic, exhorted the 19 years old Nazim Hikmet, already a famous poet, who would soon embrace the communist ideology and influence the course of modern Turkish literature, particularly poetry, more profoundly than anyone else. Since 1950, there has been a massive output, in all genres, depicting the plight of the lumpen proletariat. But surrealism, neosymbolism, theater of the absurd, stream of consciousness, hermeticism, black comedy and so on have also flourished.

==History==
In 1923, when the Republic of Turkey was proclaimed, the influential social thinker [[Ziya Gokalp|Ziya Gökalp]] wrote: "We belong to Turkish nation, the Islamic community, and Western civilization... Our literature must go the people and, at the same time, towards the West." The literature of the Turkish Republic has achieved Gokalp's objective.

Revolution, innovation, and Westernization have been driving forces of the Turkish nation in the twentieth century. The 19th century men of letters inherited the classical and the folk traditions but turned their attention to the literary tastes and movements of the West- particularly of France and England. The Ottoman state embarked upon process of transformation usually referred to as 'Westernization'.

==Major authors==

Contemporary Turkish Literature consists of many prolific authors whose works both shaped and improved the overall picture of Turkish literature. [[Mehmet Akif Ersoy]], a master of heroic diction, a major figure in early modern Turkish literature, devoted much of his verse to the dogma, and passion. His nationalism has a strong Islamic content, evident in the lyrics of the Turkish national anthem that he wrote. Yahya Kemal Beyatli was the much-acclaimed neoclassicist who produced, in the conventional forms and meters, meticulous lyrics of love, Ottoman grandeur, and Istanbul's natural attractions. Among the dedicated revolutionaries in 20th-century Turkish poetry Nazim Hikmet ranks the highest. He has been a modernizing force since the early 1920s, remaining significant in aesthetics and political terms. A communist, he spent many years in Turkish jails, fled to Soviet Union in 1951 and died in Moscow in 1963. Much of his works laments social injustice, complains of the oppression of the masses, and yearns for revolutionary change. In the mid-1950s a brave new genre emerged  the 'Village novel' which reached its apogee with [[Yasar Kemal]]'s ''Ince Memed'' (English title ''[[Memed, My Hawk]]''; this novel has been translated into 25 languages). He was considered the most famous Turkish novelist not only in turkey but also in the world press and literary circles. Satirical fiction is dominated by [[Aziz Nesin]], Turkey's best satirist ever. He is one of the most important figures of Turkish literature. He is the author of more than 100 books including poetry and prose.In more than 60 works, Nesin has provided strong indictment of the oppression and brutalization of the common man. A thrust for modernization took place in the early 1940s when Orhan Veli Kanik, Oktay Rifat, and Melih Cevdet Anday launched their poetic realism. Their urge for upheaval was revolutionary. A new generation had initiated obscurantism, continuing from where Asaf Haler Celebi's surrealism had left off in the 1940s. [[Ilhan Berk]] perhaps Turkey's most daring and durable poetic innovator, who acted as spokesman for the group (often identified as the Second New) pontificated "Art is for innovation's sake." The forms and values of classical poetry, too, are kept alive by a group of highly accomplished formalists who are clustered mainly around the monthly  ''Hisar'' which ceased publishing at the end of 1980 after 30 years.  His works have been translated into over thirty languages. [[Enis Batur]] is another important writer/poet in contemporary Turkish literature. He writes both in Turkish and in English. Some of his works are translated into English by Turkish translators. [[Orhan Pamuk]] is probably the best-known Turkish writer around the world mostly because of the [[Nobel Prize]] he won in 2006. He is considered one of the most prominent novelists of Turkey.

== Gameplay ==
''Dark Souls III'' is an [[action role-playing game]] played in a [[third-person perspective]], similar to previous games in the series. According to lead director and series creator [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]], the game's gameplay design followed "closely from ''[[Dark Souls II]]''".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/17/dark-souls-3-follows-closely-from-dark-souls-2-says-miyazaki-about-games-design/|title="Dark Souls 3 follows closely from Dark Souls 2," says Miyazaki about game’s design|first=Sherif|last=Saed|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players are equipped with a variety of weapons to fight against enemies, such as bows, throwable projectiles, and swords. Shields can act as secondary weapons but they are mainly used to deflect enemies' attacks and protect the player from suffering damage.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/16/e3-2015-dark-souls-3-is-everything-i-want-in-a-dark-souls-sequel|title=E3 2015: Dark Souls 3 Is Everything I Want In A Dark Souls Sequel|first=Chloi|last=Rad|work=[[IGN]]|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each weapon has two basic types of attack, one being a standard attack, and the other being slightly more powerful that can be charged up, similar to FromSoftware's previous game, ''[[Bloodborne]]''. In addition, attacks can be evaded through dodge-rolling.&lt;ref name="edgepre"/&gt; [[Bonfire (Dark Souls)|Bonfires]], which serve as checkpoints, return from previous installments.&lt;ref name="PCPre"/&gt; Ashes, according to Miyazaki, play an important role in the game.&lt;ref name="PolyE3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/17/8798005/dark-souls-3-e3-2015|title=Our first look at Dark Souls 3 gameplay and its new changes to combat|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magic is featured in the game, with a returning magic system from ''[[Demon's Souls]]'', now known as "[[Magic (gaming)|focus points]]" (FP). When performing spells, the player's focus points are consumed. There are two separate types of Estus Flasks in the game, which can be allotted to fit a players' particular play style. One of them refills [[Health (gaming)|hit points]] like previous games in the series, while another, newly introduced in ''Dark Souls III'', refills focus points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/9/16/9336813/dark-souls-3-magic-spells-miracles|title=How magic works in Dark Souls 3|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=September 16, 2015|accessdate=September 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combat and movements are faster and more fluid in ''Dark Souls III'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2015/6/19/8814811/dark-souls-3-e3-preview|title=Dark Souls III is faster, weirder, and far more beautiful|first=Sam|last=Byford|work=[[The Verge]]|date=June 19, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/7/20/9002955/dark-souls-3-bloodborne-combat-influences|title=Dark Souls 3's combat is faster in a post-Bloodborne world|first=Dave|last=Tach|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=July 20, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; several player movements (such as backstepping and swinging heavy weapons) can now be performed more rapidly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-07-23-dark-souls-3|title=Dark Souls 3 is familiar, and that's fin|first=Aoife|last=Wilson|date=July 23, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[Eurogamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing players to deal more damage in a short period of time.&lt;ref name="edgepre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/how-dark-souls-3-combat-changing-post-bloodborne/?hootPostID=d0bb79889104f7063157b57840a895d5|title=How Dark Souls 3 combat is changing post-Bloodborne|first=Dom|last=Reseigh-Lincoln|date=July 19, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|publisher=[[GamesRadar]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the game, players encounter different types of enemies, each with different behaviors. Some of them change their combat pattern during battles.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"/&gt; New combat features are introduced in ''Dark Souls III'', including weapon and shield "Skills", which are special abilities that vary from weapon to weapon that enable unique attacks and features at the cost of focus points.&lt;ref name="IGNPre"/&gt; The game places more focus on role-playing; the expanded character builder and improved weapons provide the player with more tactical options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gematsu.com/2015/06/dark-souls-iii-fewer-maps-larger-scale|title=Dark Souls III Have Fewer Maps, But Larger Scale|first=Sal|last=Romano|work=Gematsu|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features fewer overall maps than its predecessor ''Dark Souls II'', but they are larger and more detailed, which encourages exploration.&lt;ref name="PCPre"/&gt; The adaptability stat from ''Dark Souls II'' was removed in ''Dark Souls III'', with other stats being adjusted.&lt;ref name="PCPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-3-preview-a-grander-sense-of-scale-but-still-familiar/|title=Dark Souls 3 preview: a grander sense of scale, but still familiar|first=Wes|last=Fenlon|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[PC Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features multiplayer elements like the previous games in the series.&lt;ref name="HGPre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2015/06/16/e3-2015-worlds-first-dark-souls-iii-details-revealed/154333/|title=E3 2015: World’s First Dark Souls III Details Revealed|first=Mike|last= Patuleia|date=June 16, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015|work=[[Hardcore Gamer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
Set in the Kingdom of Lothric, a bell has rung to signal that the First Flame, responsible for maintaining the Age of Fire, is dying out. As has happened many times before, the coming of the Age of Dark produces the undead: cursed beings that rise up after death. The Age of Fire can be prolonged with the linking of the fire, a ritual in which great lords and heroes sacrifice their souls to rekindle the First Flame. However, Prince Lothric, the chosen linker for this age, has abandoned his duty and instead chooses to watch the flame die from afar. The bell is the last hope for the Age of Fire, resurrecting previous Lords of Cinder (heroes who linked the flame in past ages) to attempt to link the fire again; however, all but one Lord shirk their duty.

The Ashen One, an Undead who failed to become a Lord of Cinder and thus called an Unkindled, rises and must link the fire by returning Prince Lothric and the defiant Lords of Cinder to their thrones in  Firelink Shrine. The Lords include the Abyss Watchers, a legion of warriors sworn to protect the land from the Abyss and linked by a single soul; Yhorm the Giant, who was once a conqueror of the very people for whom he then sacrificed his life; and Saint Aldrich of the Deep, who became a Lord of Cinder despite his ravenous appetite for both men and gods. Lothric himself was raised in order to link the First Flame, but rejected his destiny and chose to watch the fire fade.

Once the Ashen One succeeds in returning Lothric and the Lords of Cinder to their thrones, they travel to the ruins of the Kiln of the First Flame. There, they encounter the Soul of Cinder, an amalgamation of all the previous Lords of Cinder who had linked the flame in the past. Once the Soul of Cinder is defeated, four endings are made possible based on the player's actions during the game. The player can attempt to link the fire, summon the Fire Keeper to extinguish the flame and begin an age of Dark or kill her. A fourth ending consists of the Ashen One taking the flame for their own and becoming the Dark Lord of Londor.

=== ''Ashes of Ariandel'' ===
''Ashes of Ariandel'' introduces a new area, the Painted World of Ariandel. On arriving at a location in the base game, the Ashen One meets a wandering knight, Gael, who implores him to enter the Painted World and fulfill a prophecy to bring "Fire for Ariandel." Inhabitants of this world variously beg the Ashen One to burn the Painted World per the prophecy or leave it to its slow rot. A painter girl tells the Ashen One of "Uncle Gael"'s promise to find her dyes to paint a new world. The player's decision to proceed elicits first coldness from the world's self-appointed guardian and then a boss fight, in which Ariandel is ultimately set on fire. The painter thanks the player for showing her flame and paints her new world.

In keeping with previous franchise DLC, ''Ashes of Ariandel'' introduces not only a substantial new area, with two boss fights, but also several new weapons, spells and pieces of armour. On completing the DLC, the player has the option of proceeding to ''The Ringed City'' DLC, if owned.

=== ''The Ringed City'' ===
{{Main|Dark Souls III: The Ringed City}}

In ''The Ringed City'', the Ashen One begins their journey to an area known as "The Dreg Heap", a region where ruined kingdoms of different eras are piled upon each other as the world draws to a close. From the Dreg Heap, after battling through the ruins of Lothric Castle, the Ashen One encounters the amnesiac knight Lapp, who cannot remember his past. The Ashen One traverses the Earthen Peak, an area encountered in ''[[Dark Souls II]]'', before fighting a boss known as the Demon Prince. Victorious, the player travels to the Ringed City, an ancient city of the Pygmies, the ancestors of humanity, which has fallen into the Abyss. After defeating the guardian of the Church of Filianore, the player's actions transport him to a ruined wasteland of ash, ostensibly in the world's future. There, the Ashen One meets a dishevelled Gael, from ''Ashes of Ariandel'', who has begun killing and looking for the souls and blood of the Pygmies for the painter girl to use as ink.

== Development ==
The development of the game began in mid-2013, prior to the release of ''Dark Souls II'', whose development was handled by Tomohiro Shibuya and Yui Tanimura instead of the series creator, [[Hidetaka Miyazaki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2015/06/18/dark-souls-3-bloodborne-development-teams-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|title=Dark Souls 3 has been in the works for two years|first=Brenna|last=Hillier|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 18, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed alongside ''[[Bloodborne]]'' but was handled by two mainly separate teams. Miyazaki also returned to direct ''Dark Souls III'', while Isamu Okano and Tanimura, the directors of ''[[Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor]]'' and ''Dark Souls II'' respectively, served as co-directors for the game.&lt;ref name="2year"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Scammell|first1=David|title=Dark Souls 3 is being developed by a different team to Bloodborne|url=http://www.videogamer.com/ps4/dark_souls_3/news/dark_souls_3_is_being_developed_by_a_different_team_to_bloodborne.html|publisher=VideoGamer.com|date=June 17, 2015|accessdate=June 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Miyazaki originally believing that the series would not have many sequels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/29/miyazaki-dark-souls-shouldnt-have-multiple-sequels|title=Miyazaki: Dark Souls Shouldn't Have Multiple Sequels|first=Luke|last=Karmali|work=[[IGN]]|date=January 29, 2013|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dark Souls III'' would serve as the fourth installment in the ''[[Souls (series)|Souls]]'' series. Miyazaki later added that the game would not be the last game in the series, and instead would serve as a "turning point" for both the franchise and the studio, as it was the last project by FromSoftware before Miyazaki became the president of the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-06-17-dark-souls-3-isnt-the-last-in-the-series-but-it-is-a-turning-point|title=Dark Souls 3 isn't the last in the series – but it is a turning point|first=Martin|last=Robinson|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=August 17, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple screenshots of the game were leaked prior to its initial reveal at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2015]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/gallery-leaked-dark-souls-iii-screenshots-look-legit-293409.phtml|title=Gallery: Leaked Dark Souls III screenshots look legit|first=Jordan|last=Devore|work=[[Destructoid]]|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/dark-souls-3-is-directed-by-hidetaka-miyazaki/1100-6428145/|title=Dark Souls 3 is Directed by Hidetaka Miyazaki|first=Tamoor|last=Hussain|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=June 15, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's gameplay was then first shown at [[Gamescom 2015]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/08/dark-souls-iii-gameplay-revealed-in-new-trailer.html|title=Dark Souls III Gameplay Revealed in New Trailer|first=Scott|last=Russell|work=[[Paste Magazine]]|date=August 4, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miyazaki said that ''Bloodborne''{{'}}s limitations made him want to return to the ''Souls'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Zarmena|title=Hidetaka Miyazaki Says Bloodborne’s Limitations Made Him Return to Dark Souls 3|url=http://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2015/09/13/miyazaki-talks-dark-souls-3-freedom/|publisher=PlayStation Lifestyle|accessdate=September 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the game's level design was created to become more of another "enemy" the player must face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/feature/a658679/everything-we-know-about-dark-souls-3-including-trailers-gameplay-and-screenshots.html#~plGXgHGBMpobLj|title=Everything we know about Dark Souls 3, including trailers, gameplay and screenshots|first=Liam|last=Martin|work=[[Digital Spy]]|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/06/24/dark-souls-3-everything-is-designed-to-kill-you/|title=Dark Souls 3: "everything is designed to kill you"|first=Matt|last=Martin|work=[[VG247]]|date=June 24, 2015|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, just as how the former ''Souls'' games narrate their stories, ''Dark Souls III'' unfolds the plot with strong vagueness: players can learn the storyline merely through the conversation with [[non-playable characters]] (NPCs), art design, and item [[flavor text]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2016/03/02/dark-souls-3-miyazaki-bloodborne-interview/|title=Dark Souls 3: Miyazaki explains the difference between “difficult” and “unreasonable”|last=Donaldson|first=Alex|date=|website=VG247|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this, Miyazaki states that there is no official and unique story, and his intention of designing this game was to not impose his own viewpoint, with him stating that any attempts to discover and understand the plot and that world are encouraged.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The improvement to archery, specifically draw speed, was inspired by [[Legolas]] from ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' franchise.&lt;ref name="PolyE3"/&gt; The game's visual design focuses on "withered beauty", with ember and ash scattered throughout the game's world.&lt;ref name="HGPre"/&gt; The game's original score was primarily written by ''Dark Souls II'' and ''Bloodborne'' composer, Yuka Kitamura, and performed by the [[Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra]]. Additional music was written by ''Dark Souls'' composer [[Motoi Sakuraba]], with a single boss theme each by Tsukasa Saitoh and Nobuyoshi Suzuki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Greening|first1=Chris|title=Dark Souls III composers and soundtrack detailed|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/dark-souls-iii-composers-and-soundtrack-detailed/|website=Video Game Music Online|accessdate=April 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls III'' was released in Japan for [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on March 24, 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=September 12, 2015 |url=http://www.fromsoftware.jp/pc_en/product.html?mode=2&amp;category=0|title=Product &amp;#124; FromSoftware|website=[[FromSoftware]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released worldwide, along with the [[Microsoft Windows]] version, on April 12, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Frank |first=Allegra |date=December 4, 2015 |url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/12/4/9849070/dark-souls-3-release-date |title=Dark Souls 3 nails down its April 2016 release date |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |accessdate=December 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A stress test for the game, which allowed players selected by Bandai Namco to test the game's network functionality before release, was available for three days in October 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezone.com/news/dark-souls-3-stress-test-will-begin-tomorrow-3426374|title=Dark Souls 3 stress test will begin tomorrow|first=Mike|last=Splechta|work=GameZone|date=October 15, 2015|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has three different special editions for players to purchase, all of which cost more than the base game. Players who pre-ordered the game had their game automatically upgraded to the ''Apocalypse Edition'', which has a special case and the game's original soundtrack. ''The Collector's Edition'' contains physical items such as the Red Knight figurine, an artbook, a new map, and special packaging. ''The Prestige Edition'' features all the content in ''The Collector's Edition'', but has an additional Lord of Cinder resin figurine, which can form a pair with the Red Knight figurine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/dark-souls-3-gets-special-editions/|title=Dark Souls 3 gets new gameplay, release date &amp; special editions|first=Conner|last=Sheriden|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=December 5, 2015|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Dark Souls III'' received "generally favorable" reviews according to [[review aggregator]], [[Metacritic]], with praise given to the game's visuals and combat mechanics, reminding reviewers of its faster paced similarity to FromSoftware's previous game, ''[[Bloodborne]]''.&lt;ref name="Destructoid"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Game Informer"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stanton|first1=Rich|title=''Dark Souls 3'' review|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2016-04-04-dark-souls-3-review|website=Eurogamer|date=April 4, 2016|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chloi Rad of [[IGN]] awarded the game a 9.5 out of 10, stating she thought that "If ''Dark Souls 3'' truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it's a worthy send-off."&lt;ref name=IGN/&gt; Rich Stanton of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' rated the game as "essential", calling it "fabulous" and that it was "a fitting conclusion" to the series.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt; Steven Strom of [[Ars Technica]] wrote that he thought the title still had the "smooth and impressive rendering of the series' signature style" and some of "the best boss fights in any ''Souls'' game".&lt;ref name="Ars Technica"/&gt; Simon Parkin of ''[[The Guardian]]'' gave the game 5 out of 5 stars, and wrote that while ''Dark Souls III'' "may not have the novelty of the first ''Dark Souls''", it was "the more pristine and rounded work" of the series.&lt;ref name="Guardian"/&gt;

However, criticism was directed at issues with the game's [[frame rate]] and performance,&lt;ref name="Polygon"/&gt; linear map design,&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ars Technica"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Strom|first1=Steven|title=''Dark Souls 3'' review: Marching toward masochism|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/04/dark-souls-3-review-marching-towards-masochism/|website=Ars Technica|date=April 5, 2016|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the way Bandai Namco handled the Western launch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bashore|first1=Nicholas|title='Dark Souls 3' and the Problem with Regional Release Dates|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/14019-dark-souls-3-and-the-problem-with-regional-release-dates|website=inverse.com|accessdate=April 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Leack|first1=Jonathan|title=Dark Souls 3's Launch Has Been Poorly Handled By Bandai Namco|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/manifesto/dark-souls-3s-launch-has-been-poorly-handled-by-bandai-namco-36405|website=Game Revolution|accessdate=April 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Kollar of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' rated the game a 7 out of 10, stating disappointment at the lack of surprises and the arbitrary nature of the game's design, writing that "in so many important ways -- its world design, its pacing, the technology powering it - ''Dark Souls III'' falls short of the mark."&lt;ref name="Polygon"/&gt; A later patch, released on April 9, fixed some of the technical issues reviewers had with the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Imtiaz|first1=Khurram|title=Dark Souls 3 Gets Patch 1.03 In Japan, Tweaks Gameplay And Improves Performance|url=http://gearnuke.com/dark-souls-3-gets-patch-1-03-japan-tweaks-gameplay-improves-performance/|website=GearNuke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reception to ''Ashes of Ariandel'', the game's first [[downloadable content]] (DLC) expansion, was generally positive. Brendan Graeber of ''IGN'' enjoyed what the DLC offered, enjoying the introduction of a dedicated [[player versus player]] (PvP) arena, as well as the new enemies and bosses, but criticized the length, stating that ''Ashes of Ariandel'' served more as "an appetizer than a full course meal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graeber|first1=Brendan|title=Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review|website=IGN|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kollar of ''Polygon'' considered the content of the DLC to be "great", but agreed with Graeber's criticism of the length, saying that there was not much of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kollar|first1=Philip|title=Dark Souls 3: Ashes of Ariandel review|url=http://www.polygon.com/2016/10/25/13411264/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review-dlc-ps4-xbox-one-pc|website=Polygon|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reception to ''The Ringed City'', the game's second and final DLC expansion, was also generally positive. Chloi Rad of ''IGN'' praised the overall level design and [[Boss (gaming)|boss fights]], adding that the DLC was a "satisfying" conclusion to the trilogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rad|first1=Chloi|title=Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City Review|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/dark-souls-3-the-ringed-city-review|website=IGN|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, James Davenport of ''PC Gamer'' was less positive, calling the DLC "gorgeous but empty", adding that it was a "weak reflection" on the series' best traits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Davenport|first1=James|title=Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City review|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dark-souls-3-the-ringed-city-review/|website=PC Gamer|accessdate=23 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4191">'''Donald Gladstone Rodney''' (18 May 1961 – 4 March 1998) was a British artist. He was a leading figure in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[BLK Art Group]] of the 1980s and became recognised as "one of the most innovative and versatile artists of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tate-britain/exhibition/donald-rodney-display/biography-and-timeline|title=Donald Rodney Display - Biography|accessdate=22 October 2007|year=2004|publisher=Tate Britain}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodney's work appropriated images from the mass media, art and popular culture to explore issues of [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial identity]] and [[racism]].

==Early life and career==
Rodney was born and raised in [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. He completed a pre-degree course at [[Bournville School of Art]] and went on to complete an [[honours degree]] in [[Fine Art]] at [[Trent Polytechnic]] in [[Nottingham]], graduating in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iniva.org/autoicon/DR/bio.htm|title=Donald Rodney biography|last=Chambers|first=Eddie|date=December 1999|publisher=[[Iniva]]|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, he met [[Keith Piper (artist)|Keith Piper]], also from Birmingham. Piper was to influence Rodney's work towards more political themes. The works of Rodney and Piper, alongside [[Eddie Chambers (writer and artist)|Eddie Chambers]], Marlene Smith and [[Claudette Johnson]] became recognised as a distinct movement within British art, whose attachments were to social and political narratives.

==Death and legacy==
Rodney suffered from [[sickle-cell anaemia]], a debilitating disease that grew steadily worse during his life.&lt;ref name="Latimer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/29130/donald-rodney/|title=Donald Rodney|last=Latimer|first=Quinn|date=1 November 2008|publisher=[[Artinfo]]|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to an interest in discarded hospital X-rays and other medical themes that began to inform his work. Rodney used X-rays as a metaphor to represent the "disease" of [[apartheid]] and racial discrimination in society.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Barson, [http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/rodney-in-the-house-of-my-father-p78529/text-summary "Donald Rodney | In the House of My Father 1996–7"], Tate, February 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Rodney succumbed to the disease&lt;ref name="Latimer"/&gt; and died on 4 March.

After his death, Rodney’s work was shown in the prestigious British art show ''5''. He was also included in the show ''Give and Take, Works Presented to Museums by the Contemporary Art Society'' held at the [[Harris Museum]] and the [[Jerwood Gallery]] (2000).

In 2003 Rodney's papers were donated to the Tate Archive.

The exhibition ''Donald Rodney - In Retrospect'' took place at [[Iniva]], [[London]], 30 October–29 November 2008.&lt;ref name=Iniva&gt;Iniva, [http://www.iniva.org/programme/projects/donald-rodney-in-retrospect/ "Donald Rodney In Retrospect"] Iniva, 2017 .&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Flora Caroline Twort''' (24 June 1893 &amp;ndash; 1985) was an English painter who specialised in [[Watercolor painting|watercolour]]s and [[pastel]]s of the scenes and people of [[Petersfield, Hampshire|Petersfield]], [[Hampshire]].

==Biography==
Twort was born on 24 June 1893 in [[Yeovil]], [[Somerset]]. Her parents were [[Albert Samuel Twort]] and Jane Rapley.&lt;ref name=Birth&gt;{{cite web |url=http://worldconnect.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=GET&amp;db=turte_twort&amp;id=P972 |title=Ancestry chart of John Turte &amp; Katerina Holmsby |publisher=Rootsweb |accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twort began painting at the age of four, and was educated at the [[South Hampstead High School]],&lt;ref&gt;Who was Flora Twort?, HantsWeb biography&lt;/ref&gt; [[London School of Art]], the [[University of Westminster|Regent Street Polytechnic]] and the [[Slade School of Art]]. At the end of [[World War I]] she moved to Petersfield, where she ran a secondhand bookshop at Numbers 1 and 2 The Square, in partnership with two other young women. The shop also sold handmade jewellery, pottery and textiles and gained a reputation as one of the finest book shops in the South of England. In 1934 she joined the [[Society of Women Artists]].&lt;ref name=cook&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Jean H |date=1998 |title=Famous Women of Hampshire |publisher=Happy Walking International |pages=34-35 |isbn=1874754675}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Her studio was above this shop until 1948, when the three partners decided to give up the shop and Twort moved to a studio in the nearby Church Path. Her work was exhibited in the [[Royal Academy]] and other London galleries, and she continued to paint until she was 81.

Her pictures, usually watercolours, typically contain local scenes of Petersfield which are filled with people and animals, with such subjects as The Square on Market Day, or the fair on Petersfield Heath. She also produced drawings in pencil, crayon, charcoal and pastel, including some fine portraits.

Twort was a friend of [[Nevil Shute]], who in 1925 proposed marriage to her, unsuccessfully, though they remained lifelong friends &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevilshute.org/TimeLine/timeline1921-1930.php Timeline 1921-1930], Neville Shute Norway Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; and she became godmother to his daughter Shirley Anne.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nevilshute.org/TimeLine/timeline1931-1940.php Timeline 1931-1940], Neville Shute Norway Foundation&lt;/ref&gt; For a short period in 1939, Shute and his family lived at The Old Mill at [[Langstone, Hampshire|Langstone]], which she owned.

On her death she bequeathed her studio cottage and pictures to [[Hampshire County Council]]. A selection of her pictures is now displayed in her old studios, which have become the 
[[Flora Twort Gallery]]; the selection is changed twice per year. Hampshire County Council has also put 600 of her pictures online.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8481">'''Geocriticism''' is a method of [[literary analysis]] and [[literary theory]] that incorporates the study of geographic space. The term designates a number of different critical practices.  In France, [[Bertrand Westphal]] has elaborated the concept of ''géocritique'' in several works.&lt;ref&gt;See Westphal, ''La Géocritique, Réel, Fiction, Espace'', Paris, Éditions de Minuit, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the United States, [[Robert Tally]] has argued for a geocriticism as a critical practice suited to the analysis of what he has termed "literary cartography".&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Tally's "Geocriticism and Classic American Literature" and ''Spatiality''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
Some of the first expressly ''geocritical'' writings emerged from symposia organized by  Westphal at the [[University of Limoges]]. Westphal's foundational essay, "Pour une approche géocritique des textes"&lt;ref&gt;Available in French online at http://www.vox-poetica.net/sflgc/biblio/gcr.html&lt;/ref&gt; constitutes a [[manifesto]] for geocriticism.  Westphal's theory is elaborated in greater detail in his ''Geocriticism: Real and Fictional Spaces'', translated by Tally, who also provides a brief introduction.  But there are also many works addressing similar themes and using similar methods that might be considered geocritical, even if the term "geocriticism" is not used.

== Theory ==
In Westphal's theory, geocriticism is based on three theoretical concepts: spatio-temporality, transgressivity, and referentiality. 

The idea that space and time form a continuum ([[space-time]]) is a tenet of modern physics. In the field of literary theory, geocriticism is an interdisciplinary method of literary analysis that focuses not only on such temporal data as relations between the life and times of the author (as in biographical criticism), the history of the text (as in [[textual criticism]]), or the story (as studied by [[narratology]]), but also on spatial data. Geocriticism therefore has affinities with geography, architecture, urban studies, and so on; it also correlates to philosophical concepts such as [[deterritorialization]].
 
Following the work of [[Michel Foucault]], [[Gilles Deleuze]], [[Henri Lefebvre]] and [[Mikhail Bakhtin]], among others, a geocritical approach to literature recognizes that representations of space are often transgressive, crossing the boundaries of established norms while also reestablishing new relations among people, places, and things. Cartography is no longer seen as the exclusive province of the state or the government; rather, various agents or groups may be responsible for representing the geographic spaces at the same time and with different effects. In practice, therefore, geocriticism is multifocal, examining a variety of topics at once, thus differentiating itself from practices that focus on the singular point of view of the traveler or protagonist. 

Geocriticism also assumes a literary referentiality between world and text, or, in other words, between the referent and its representation. By questioning the relations between a given space's nature and its actually existing condition, the geocritical approach allows for a study of fiction that points also to the theory of possible worlds, such as may be seen in the work on third space by the American geographer [[Edward Soja]] (''Thirdspace''). Tally's book ''Spatiality'', an introduction to spatiality studies in literature and critical theory, includes a chapter on geocriticism.

== Critical practices ==
Geocriticism frequently involves the study of places described in the literature by various authors, but it can also study the effects of literary representations of a given space. An example of the range of geocritical practices can be found in Tally's collection ''Geocritical Explorations: Space, Place, and Mapping in Literary and Cultural Studies''.

Geocriticism derives some of its practices from precursors whose theoretical work helped establish space as a valid topic for literary analysis.  For example, in ''The Poetics of Space'' and elsewhere, Gaston Bachelard studied literary works to develop a typology of places according to their connotations. Maurice Blanchot's writings have legitimized the idea of literary space, an imaginary place for the creation of the work of literature. One might also look at the developments of cultural studies and especially postcolonial studies, such as [[Raymond Williams]]'s ''The Country and the City'' or [[Edward Said]]'s ''Culture and Imperialism'', which employ what Said has called a "geographical inquiry into historical experience."&lt;ref&gt;Said, ''Culture and Imperialism'', p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fredric Jameson]]'s concept of cognitive mapping and his theoretical engagement with the postmodern condition also highlight the importance of spatial representation and aesthetic productions, including literature, film, architecture, and design.  In ''The Atlas of European Novel, 1800-1900'', [[Franco Moretti]] has examined the diffusion of literary spaces in Europe, focusing on the complex relationship between the text and space. Moretti has also promulgated a theory of literary history, or literary geography, that would use maps to bring to light new connections between the texts studied and their social spaces.&lt;ref&gt;See Moretti, ''Graphs, Maps, Trees''.&lt;/ref&gt;  And, in his study of Herman Melville's literary cartography, Robert Tally has offered a geocritical approach to certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;See Tally, ''Melville, Mapping and Globalization''.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Geocriticism has intellectual and methodological affiliations with such fields as Literature and the Environment or [[ecocriticism]], regional literature, urban studies, sociological and philosophical approaches to literature, and utopian studies.

'''George Denis Patrick Carlin''' (May 12, 1937 – June 22, 2008) was an American stand-up comedian, actor, author, and social critic.

Carlin was noted for his [[black comedy]] and reflections on politics, the English language, psychology, religion, and various taboo subjects. He and his "[[seven dirty words]]" comedy routine were central to the 1978 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', in which a 5–4 decision affirmed the government's power to [[Censorship in the United States#Broadcast censorship|regulate indecent material on the public airwaves]]. He is widely regarded as one of the most important and influential stand-up comics; one newspaper called Carlin "the dean of [[Counterculture of the 1960s|counterculture]] comedians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cleveland.com/people/index.ssf/2008/06/george_carlin_counterculture_c.html |title=George Carlin, counterculture comedians' dean, dies at 71 |first=Michael |last=Norman |work=[[The Plain Dealer]] |location=[[Cleveland, Ohio]] |date=June 23, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, he placed second on the [[Comedy Central]] list of "Top 10 Comedians of US Audiences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |title=Stand Up Comedy &amp; Comedians |publisher=Comedy Zone |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123214352/http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm |archivedate=November 23, 2005 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of Carlin's 14 stand-up comedy specials for [[HBO]] was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on sociocultural criticism of American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of [[American culture]]. He was a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' during the three-decade [[Johnny Carson]] era, and hosted the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1975. His final HBO special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', was filmed less than four months before his death. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].  In 2017, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked him second (behind [[Richard Pryor]]) on its list of the 50 best stand-up comics of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/lists/50-best-stand-up-comics-of-all-time-w464199 The 50 Best Stand-up Comics of All Time].

His father was an Irish immigrant from [[County Donegal]], while his mother was an Irish-American. Carlin's maternal grandfather, Dennis Bearey, was an Irish immigrant who worked as an [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]] officer. Carlin recalled that his grandmother's maiden name was O'Grady, but it was changed to Grady before she reached the U.S. He later joked that they "dropped the O in the ocean on the way here". He would later name his character on ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'' O'Grady as an act of homage to her.&lt;ref name=NEA&gt;{{cite news |authorlink=Frank Lovece |last=Lovece |first=Frank |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6vghAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=pKIFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2453,999986 |title=Going, Going, Gone?

His parents separated when he was two months old because of his father's [[alcoholism]].

He briefly attended [[Bishop Dubois High School]] in Harlem and the [[Salesians of Don Bosco|Salesian]] High School in [[Goshen, New York]].&lt;ref name=Gonzalez&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Gonzalez |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/24/nyregion/24hayes.html |title=George Carlin Didn't Shun School That Ejected Him |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 24, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent many summers at Camp Notre Dame on [[Spofford Lake]] in [[Spofford, New Hampshire]], and regularly won the camp's drama award. Much later in life, he requested that a portion of his ashes be spread at the lake after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtourguide.com/nh_facts.htm |title=Interesting, Strange &amp; Weird New Hampshire Facts |publisher=NHTourGuide.com |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin joined the [[United States Air Force]] and trained as a radar technician. He was stationed at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]]. He also began working as a disc jockey at radio station KJOE, in nearby [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. Labeled an "unproductive airman" by his superiors, Carlin received a general discharge on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force, he had been [[court-martial]]ed three times, and also received many nonjudicial punishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2008/film/news/comedian-george-carlin-dies-at-71-1117987925/ |title=Comedian George Carlin dies at 71 |publisher=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=June 22, 2008 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, Carlin met [[Jack Burns]], a fellow DJ at radio station [[KMNY|KXOL]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html|title=Texas Radio Hall of Fame: George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040923044145/http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html |archivedate=September 23, 2004 |accessdate=June 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They formed a comedy team and after successful performances at Fort Worth's [[Beat Generation|beat]] coffeehouse called The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960.&lt;ref name="james7"/&gt;

Within weeks of arriving in California, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created ''The Wright Brothers'', a morning show on [[KDAY]] in Hollywood. During their tenure at KDAY, they honed their material in [[beatnik]] coffeehouses at night.&lt;ref name=bio60s&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |title=Timeline – 1960s |work=George Carlin Biography |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000621020616/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html |archivedate=June 21, 2000 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later when he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entity_id=19830&amp;source_type=A|title=Biographical information for George Carlin|publisher=Kennedy Center|date=|accessdate=July 30, 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220184243/http://kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entity_id=19830&amp;source_type=A|archivedate=February 20, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, ''[[Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight]]'', in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=bio60s /&gt; After two years together as a team, they parted to pursue individual careers, but "remain[ed] the best of friends".&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, George (2009). Last Words. New York: Free Press, pp. 47–8. {{ISBN|1-4391-7295-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, where he played various characters:&lt;ref name=timeline /&gt;
* The Indian Sergeant&amp;nbsp;– "There will be a rain dance tonight ... weather permitting ..."
* Stupid disc jockeys ("Wonderful WINO radio ...")&amp;nbsp;– "The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says, 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'"
* Al Sleet, the Hippie-Dippie Weatherman&amp;nbsp;– "Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued mostly dark tonight, changing to widely scattered light towards morning."

Variations on these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, ''[[Take-Offs and Put-Ons]]'', which was recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in [[Detroit|Detroit, Michigan]] and issued by [[RCA Victor]] in 1967.&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |title=George Carlin's official site (see Timeline) |publisher=Georgecarlin.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008001351/http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html |archivedate=October 8, 2009 |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George Carlin 1969.JPG|thumb|right|George Carlin in 1969]]
During this period, Carlin became a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', initially with [[Jack Paar]] as host, then with [[Johnny Carson]]. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in ''Away We Go'', a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061235/fullcredits | title=Away We Go (1967– ) Full Cast &amp; Crew | website=IMDb | access-date=June 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as "conventional", particularly when contrasted with his later [[anti-establishment]] material.&lt;ref&gt;''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''; June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was present at [[Lenny Bruce]]'s arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Profanity|episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes|series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|serieslink=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|airdate=August 12, 2004|season=2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, Carlin was making about $250,000 annually.&lt;ref name=Zoglin/&gt; As a [[tax shelter]] he bought a private jet&amp;nbsp;– a twin-engine [[IAI Westwind|Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander]].

[[File:George Carlin In concert at the Zembo Mosque, Harrisburg, Pa.jpg|thumb|left|George Carlin in concert at [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]]]]
Eventually, Carlin changed his routines and his appearance. Carlin hired talent managers – Jeff Wald and Ron De Blasio – to help him reinvent his image, making him look more [[Hip (slang)|hip]] for a younger audience. Wald put Carlin into much smaller clubs such as [[The Troubadour, West Hollywood|The Troubadour]] in West Hollywood and [[The Bitter End]] in New York City. Wald says that Carlin's income was thus reduced by 90%, but his later career arc was greatly improved.&lt;ref name=Zoglin&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xg1h5lBheQC&amp;pg=PT34 |pages=34–35 |last=Zoglin |first=Richard |title=Comedy at the Edge: How Stand-up in the 1970s Changed America |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing |year=2008 |isbn=9781596919440 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1970, record producer [[Monte Kay]] formed the [[Little David Records]] subsidiary of Atlantic Records, with comedian [[Flip Wilson]] as co-owner.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 2010, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Kay and Wilson signed Carlin away from RCA Records, and recorded a Carlin performance at [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[The Cellar Door]] in May 1971—this was released as ''[[FM &amp; AM]]'' in January 1972. De Blasio was busy managing the fast-paced career of [[Freddie Prinze]], and was about to sign [[Richard Pryor]], so he released Carlin to Little David general manager Jack Lewis, who, like Carlin, was somewhat wild and rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan 2010, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time, wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by [[Ed Sullivan]] in a performance of "The Hair Piece" and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.&lt;ref name="GoldmarkBio"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldmark|first1=Tony|title=George Carlin – Biography|url=http://www.amoeba.com/george-carlin/artist/146678/bio|website=Amoeba Music|accessdate=September 1, 2016|quote=He bridged these two sides of his persona with 'The Hair Piece,' a whimsical poem about public aversion to long hair that he performed on Ed Sullivan, effectively reintroducing and reinventing himself to America. FM &amp; AM went Gold, got him a gig at Carnegie Hall, and won the Grammy award for Best Comedy Album.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1972, singer-songwriter [[Kenny Rankin]] was Carlin's label mate on Little David Records, and Rankin served many times as Carlin's musical guest or opening act during the early 1970s. The two flew together in Carlin's private jet; Carlin says that Rankin relapsed into using cocaine while on tour since Carlin had so much of the drug available.&lt;ref name=Jet/&gt;

The album ''[[FM &amp; AM]]'' proved very popular. It marked Carlin's change from mainstream to counterculture comedy. The "AM" side was an extension of Carlin's previous style, with zany but relatively clean routines parodying aspects of American life. The "FM" side introduced Carlin's new style, with references to marijuana and birth control pills, and a playful examination of the word "shit". In this manner, Carlin renewed a style of radical social commentary comedy that Lenny Bruce had pioneered in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=Zoglin/&gt;

In this period Carlin perfected his well-known routine, "[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]", recorded on ''[[Class Clown]]''. On July 21, 1972, Carlin was arrested after performing this routine at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] and charged with violating [[obscenity]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears|author=Jim Stingl|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=June 30, 2007|accessdate=March 23, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as "the Milwaukee Seven", was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after listening with his son to a similar routine, "Filthy Words", from ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'', broadcast one afternoon over [[WBAI]], a [[Pacifica Foundation]] FM radio station in New York City. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC for violating regulations that prohibit broadcasting "obscene" material. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was "indecent but not obscene" and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience (''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', 438 U.S. 726 (1978); the court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine).&lt;ref name="EFF"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/FCC_v_Pacifica/fcc_v_pacifica.decision |title=FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation |date=July 3, 1978 |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy increased Carlin's fame. He eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version, and accompanying the credits in the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' special for the 1982–83 season) and a set of 49 web pages organized by subject and embracing his "Incomplete List of Impolite Words".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |title=BBS – Incomplete List of Impolite Words |publisher=George Carlin |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406052624/http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html |archivedate=April 6, 2012 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On stage, during a rendition of his "Dirty Words" routine, Carlin learned that his previous comedy album ''FM &amp; AM'' had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album ''Occupation: Foole'', he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaimed "Shit!" and proudly announced his win to the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55pfcmUzGhw#t=2355 |title=George Carlin – Occupation: Foole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', on October 11, 1975, the only episode to date in which the host did not appear (at his request) in sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geoffrey Hammill, The Museum of Broadcast Communications |url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/saturdaynigh/saturdaynigh.htm |title=Saturday Night Live |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020820194836/http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/saturdaynigh/saturdaynigh.htm |archivedate=August 20, 2002 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, 1976–77, he appeared regularly on [[CBS]] Television's ''[[Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn]]'' variety series.&lt;ref name="TVGuideTonyOrlandoAndDawn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Tony Orlando and Dawn 1974 TV SHOW|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/tony-orlando-and-dawn/cast/205090/|website=TVGuide.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901182949/http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/tony-orlando-and-dawn/cast/205090/|archivedate=September 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'' series; doing 14 specials, including 2008's ''It's Bad For Ya!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biography.com/people/george-carlin-9542307#comic-great |title=George Carlin stand up comedian does 14 specials for On Location |last= |first= |date= |publisher=[[Biography.com]] ([[FYI (TV network)|FYI]] / [[A&amp;E Networks]]) |accessdate= October 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] during this layoff period.&lt;ref name="bravo"&gt;{{cite episode|title=George Carlin|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo TV]]|airdate=October 31, 2004|season=11|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.&lt;ref name="EssSplitsider2015"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ess|first1=Ramsey|title=How George Carlin Changed comedy In His First HBO Special|url=http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|website=Splitsider.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160617094322/http://splitsider.com/2015/04/how-george-carlin-changed-comedy-in-his-first-hbo-special/|archivedate=June 17, 2016 |date=April 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LeveretteOttBuckley2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leverette|first1=Marc|last2=Ott|first2=Brian L|last3=Buckley|first3=Cara Louise|title=It's Not TV: Watching HBO in the Post-Television Era|date=March 23, 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135902742|page=128|url=https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160901182100/https://www.routledge.com/Its-Not-TV-Watching-HBO-in-the-Post-Television-Era/Leverette-Ott-Buckley/p/book/9780415960380|archivedate=September 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Loz carlinbd2.jpg|thumb|George Carlin at a book signing for ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' in [[New York City]] at [[Barnes &amp; Noble]]]]
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing ''[[A Place for My Stuff]]'' and returning to HBO and New York City with the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' TV special, videotaped at [[Carnegie Hall]] and airing during the 1982–83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

He hosted ''SNL'' for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time appearing in several sketches.&lt;ref name="NBCSNL11101984"&gt;{{cite web|title=MONOLOGUE: GEORGE CARLIN RETURNS TO HOST SNL|url=http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/george-carlin-monologue/n9279|website=NBC.com|accessdate=September 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin began to achieve prominence as a film actor with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Shelley Long]]; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the [[1960s counterculture]]. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the title characters in ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and reprised his role in the film sequel ''[[Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' as well as the first season of the [[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|cartoon series]]. He also played the role of "Mr Conductor" on the [[PBS]] show ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' and narrated the show's sequences of the American version of ''[[Thomas &amp; Friends]]'' from 1991 to 1995, replacing [[Ringo Starr]]. On the first day of the assignment, Carlin was cross about recording his narration without an audience, so the producers put a stuffed teddy bear in the booth.&lt;ref name=LAT&gt;{{cite web|last=Allcroft |first=Britt |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/sunday/commentary/la-oew-allcroft26-2008jun26,0,3849505.story |title=Los Angeles Times – "The George Carlin I knew" |work=Los Angeles Times |date=26 June 2008 |accessdate=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'', which starred [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Barbra Streisand]], portraying the gay neighbor of the main character's suicidal sister.&lt;ref name="Grimes1992"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grimes|first1=William|authorlink=William Grimes (journalist)|title=George Carlin, Small but Amusing|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|website=New York Times|accessdate=September 1, 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526055649/http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/21/news/george-carlin-small-but-amusing.html|archivedate=May 26, 2015 |date=January 21, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Carlin began a weekly [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] sitcom, ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'', playing New York City [[taxicab]] driver George O'Grady. &lt;!--He quickly included a variation of the "seven words" in the plot.--&gt; The show, created and written by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' co-creator [[Sam Simon]], ran 27 episodes through December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |title=1990–1999 |publisher=GeorgeCarlin.com |date= |accessdate=July 30, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130011335/http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html |archivedate=January 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his final book, the posthumously published ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]'', Carlin said about ''The George Carlin Show'', "I had a great time. I never laughed so much, so often, so hard as I did with cast members [[Alex Rocco]], [[Christopher Rich (actor)|Chris Rich]], [[Anthony Starke|Tony Starke]]. There was a very strange, very good sense of humor on that stage ... [but] I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work."&lt;ref&gt;''Last Words'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009'&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin later explained that there were other, more pragmatic reasons for abandoning his acting career in favor of standup. In an interview for [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'']] magazine in 2001, he said, "Because of my abuse of drugs, I neglected my business affairs and had large arrears with the IRS, and that took me eighteen to twenty years to dig out of. I did it honorably, and I don't begrudge them. I don't hate paying taxes, and I'm not angry at anyone, because I was complicit in it. But I'll tell you what it did for me: it made me a way better comedian. Because I had to stay out on the road and I couldn't pursue that movie career, which would have gone nowhere, and I became a really good comic and a really good writer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/what-ive-learned/george-carlin-quotes-0102 |title=What I've Learned: George Carlin |publisher=Esquire.com |date=June 23, 2008 |author=Larry Getlen |accessdate=June 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was honored at the 1997 [[Aspen Comedy Festival]] with a retrospective, ''[[George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]]. His first hardcover book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'' (1997), sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the ''[[New York Times]]'' best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|title=The Kennedy Center|accessdate=June 12, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224111638/http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|archivedate=December 24, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Carlin was given a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the 15th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]].
In December 2003 Representative [[Doug Ose]] (R-California) introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's "seven dirty words",&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/108th-congress/house-bill/3687|title=H.R.3687 - To amend section 1464 of title 18, United States Code, to provide for the punishment of certain profane broadcasts, and for other purposes.|last=|first=|date=December 8, 2003|website=congress.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; including "compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms)". The bill omitted "tits", but included "asshole", which was not one of Carlin's original seven words. The bill was referred to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties|House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution]] in January 2004, where it was tabled.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Carlin performed regularly as a headliner in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], but in 2004 his run at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] was terminated after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set, filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin complained that he could not wait to get out of "this fucking hotel" and Las Vegas; he wanted to go back east, he said, "where the real people are". He continued:

{{quote|People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects.}}

When an audience member shouted "Stop degrading us!" Carlin responded "Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me." He was immediately fired, and soon thereafter his representative announced that he would begin treatment for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction on his own initiative.&lt;ref name="tagreviewj"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |title=Dark Carlin |publisher=reviewjournal.com |date=December 4, 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041207042940/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html |archivedate=December 7, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/12/27/george.carlin/index.html? |title=George Carlin enters rehab |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=December 29, 2004 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Topics included suicide, [[natural disaster]]s, [[cannibalism]], [[genocide]], [[human sacrifice]], threats to [[civil liberties]] in the U.S., and the case for his theory that humans are inferior to other animals. At the first tour stop at the Tachi Palace Casino in [[Lemoore, California]] in February, Carlin mentioned that the appearance was his "first show back" after a six-week hospitalization for heart failure and [[pneumonia]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Carlin voiced a character in the 2006 [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]''. The character, Fillmore, is an anti-establishment hippie [[VW Microbus]] with a [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] paint job and the license plate "51237"&amp;nbsp;– Carlin's birthday. In 2007, Carlin voiced the wizard in ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', his last film.

Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', aired live on March 1, 2008, from the [[Wells Fargo Center for the Arts]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/movies/dvd/2007-09-24-carlin-collection_N.htm |title=George Carlin reflects on 50 years (or so) of 'All My Stuff' |author=Wloszczyna, Susan |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes included "American bullshit", rights, death, old age, and child rearing.

When asked on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' what turned him on, he responded, "Reading about language." When asked what made him proudest of his career, he said the number of his books that have been sold, close to a million copies.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Death==
Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning three decades.

== Internet hoaxes ==
Many writings found on the internet have been falsely attributed to Carlin, including various joke lists, rants, and other pieces. The web site [[Snopes]], an online resource that debunks [[urban legend]]s and myths, has addressed these hoaxes. Many of them contain material that runs counter to Carlin's viewpoints; some are especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, and other targets. Carlin was aware of these bogus emails and debunked them on his own web site, saying, "Here's a rule of thumb, folks: Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my web site", and "It bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff." [[Weird Al Yankovic]] referenced these hoaxes in a line of his song "[[Alpocalypse#Track listing|Stop Forwarding That Crap to Me]]" by saying "And by the way, those quotes from George Carlin aren't really George Carlin".&lt;ref&gt;

'''''Gold Ring'''''&lt;!--English title "Gold Ring" appears on book cover--&gt; ({{lang-ar|سوار الذهب}}, Siwari Al-Dhahab) is a [[United Arab Emirates]] comic written by [[Qais Sedki]] and drawn by [[Akira Himekawa]].&lt;ref name="Goodmanga"&gt;Good, Oliver.

When Sedki founded [[Dubai]]-based publishing house, Pageflip,&lt;ref name="Goodmanga"/&gt; he wrote that he wanted to fight the perception that Classical Arabic, associated with schoolwork, was "boring." To help form his comic, Sedki approached a female duo of comic book artists, known under the pen name, Akira Himekawa, and asked for consultation on how to best express the manga style.&lt;ref name="NeildManga"/&gt; The Himekawa duo became the artists of the books.&lt;ref name="Goodmanga"/&gt; ''Gold Ring'' was awarded the 2010 [[Sheikh Zayed Book Award]] for children's literature.&lt;ref name="NeildManga"/&gt;

Volume 2 of ''Gold Ring'' was released on March 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lIJGGmoMP8&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, Japanese animation studio, [[Gainax]] announced they would be developing an anime based on the comic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-06-30/gainax-makes-anime-of-arabic-manga-gold-ring-by-zelda-himekawa/.76136 |title=Gainax Makes Anime of Arabic Manga Gold Ring by Zelda's Himekawa |date=June 6, 2014 |publisher=Anime News Network |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6XKcNt1Ng?url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2014-06-30/gainax-makes-anime-of-arabic-manga-gold-ring-by-zelda-himekawa/.76136 |archivedate=2015-03-27 |df= }} ()&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
The story revolves around Sultan, an Arab boy who watches the Gold Ring [[falconry]] competition with his friend Ziad. At the competition they find a caged falcon. Sultan convinces his friend to release the falcon into the wild. The next morning, the falcon is at Sultan's doorstep. Sultan calls the bird "'''Majd'''" and trains her for an upcoming falconry competition.

The Tovsta Mohyla burial mound, meaning fat [[Tumulus|barrow]], is located in present day southern [[Ukraine]] near the city of [[Pokrov, Dnipropetrovsk Oblast|Pokrov]] in [[Dnipropetrovsk|Dnipro]] region.&lt;ref name=Kuzych&gt;Kuzych and Bekhtir, "The golden pectoral from Tovsta Mohyla.".&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ancient [[Scythians]] were a semi-nomadic [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] people that lived around the northern area of the [[Black Sea]] with territory that stretched up into the [[Ural Mountains|Ural]] and [[Altai Mountain]] region.  Their culture is thought to have lasted almost 1000 years, during which time they traded regularly with many [[Mediterranean]] and [[Asia]]n cultures including the ancient [[Greeks]], the ancient [[Persian people|Persians]] and the ancient [[Chinese people|Chinese]].&lt;ref name=Kuzych/&gt;

The golden [[pectoral cross|pectoral]] or [[breastplate]] is thought to have been ordered by a Scythian chieftain, made either by the native Scythian artisans, as some modern scholarly opinion maintains, or as usually thought, by [[ancient Greek art|ancient Greek metalworkers]] probably located in [[Pantikapaion]] which is in present day [[Crimea]] on the [[Black Sea]].  At any rate the style is certainly Greek, although the imagery reflects Scythian interests.  The [[pectoral cross|pectoral]] is made of solid 24 carat gold, with a diameter of 12 inches (30.6 cm) and weighs just over 2.5 pounds (1150 g)&lt;ref name=Kuzych/&gt; It is in the shape of a [[crescent]] and can be stylistically broken down into three sections.&lt;ref name=Pidvysotska&gt;Pidvysotska ans Samina, "SCYTHIAN KING'S GOLD PECTORAL.".&lt;/ref&gt;  The top section, which is widely agreed to be the main focus of the piece, reflects Scythian daily life.&lt;ref name=Kuzych/&gt;  The middle section is believed to represent Scythian connection to nature.  Being that there are so many delicate details in this section the artisan(s) chose to solder all of the individual elements to a solid gold plate which serves as a backing for structural support.&lt;ref name=Reeder&gt;Reeder (ed.), "Scythian Gold: treasures from ancient Ukraine.".&lt;/ref&gt;  The third section is thought to represent Scythian belief in the [[cosmos]] and their mythology.&lt;ref name=Pidvysotska/&gt;

It is believed that the pectoral was created by soldering together dozens of individually cast figures and elements.&lt;ref name=Reeder/&gt;

'''''Hara-Kiri''''' was a monthly French [[satire|satirical]] magazine, first published in 1960, the precursor to ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]''. It was created by [[Georges Bernier]], [[François Cavanna|Cavanna]] and [[Fred Aristidès]]. A weekly counterpart, '''''Hara-Kiri Hebdo''''', was first published in 1969.

Contributors included [[Melvin Van Peebles]], [[Jean-Marc Reiser|Reiser]], [[Roland Topor]], [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]], [[Georges Wolinski|Wolinski]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Gébé|fr}}, [[Cabu]], {{Interlanguage link multi|Delfeil de Ton|fr}}, [[Jean-Claude Fournier|Fournier]], [[Jean-Pierre Bouyxou]] and [[Willem (cartoonist)|Willem]]. In 1966 it published ''[[The Adventures of Jodelle|Les Aventures de Jodelle]]'', drawn by [[Guy Peellaert]] 

Hara-Kiri editions, subtitled "''Journal bête et méchant''" ("Stupid and nasty newspaper"), were constantly aiming at established powers, be they political parties or institutions like the Church or the State. In 1961 and 1966 the monthly magazine was temporarily banned by the French government.

==''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' becomes ''Charlie Hebdo''==
In November 1970, following the death of [[Charles de Gaulle]] at his home in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], the weekly ''Hara-Kiri Hebdo'' bore the headline ''« Bal tragique à Colombey : 1 mort »'' (Eng: "Tragic ball in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises|Colombey]]: 1 death").

By way of contradistinction, the choice of the title refers to the far greater loss of life the same month: a [[Club Cinq-Sept fire|fire at a discothèque]] in which 146 people died.  The government felt this editorial choice was an offence of [[lèse-majesté]] against the deceased President and its then minister of the interior [[Raymond Marcellin]] ordered an immediate and permanent ban on publicity and on sale to minors.

''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was started immediately afterwards. Charlie in the title refers to General de Gaulle (said [[Georges Wolinski]]); but it was also the name of another magazine from Éditions du Square ''[[Charlie Mensuel]]'', named after the character [[Charlie Brown]] from [[Charles M. Schulz]]'s ''[[Peanuts]]''.

The '''Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts''' was established by the [[Hawaii State Legislature]] in 1965 to "promote, perpetuate, preserve, and encourage culture and the arts, history and the humanities as central to the quality of life of the people of Hawaii".  The establishment of this agency allowed Hawaii to receive federal grants from the [[National Endowment for the Arts]].&lt;ref name="SFCA"&gt;[http://hawaii.gov/sfca/aboutus.php?article_id=9 History, Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the Hawaii State Legislature enacted the Art in State Buildings Law, to be administered by the foundation. It mandated that one percent of the construction cost of new state buildings be set aside to purchase art. [[Hawaii]] thus became the first state in the United States with a [[Percent for Art]] law.&lt;ref name="SFCA" /&gt;

In 1970, the foundation and the state [[Hawai'i Department of Education|Department of Education]] jointly established the Artists in the Schools Program, making Hawaii the first state to establish a statewide partnership between schools and professional artists.&lt;ref name="SFCA" /&gt;

In 1989, the Art for State Buildings Law, was expanded to establish the Works of Art Special Fund, a permanent fund for the purchase of art, also managed by the foundation.

In the fall of 2002, the [[Hawaii State Art Museum]] opened in the No. 1 Capitol District Building, at 250 South Hotel Street in [[Honolulu]], where the offices of the Hawaii State Foundation on Culture and the Arts are also located.

'''Henry Thomas Alken''' (12 October 1785 – 7 April 1851) was an [[England|English]] painter and [[engraver]] chiefly known as a caricaturist and illustrator of sporting subjects and coaching scenes.&lt;ref name="tatlock"&gt;R. R. Tatlock. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/861124 Henry Alken] (The Burlington Magazine for Connoisseurs, Vol. 37, No. 212, - Nov 1920) pp. 247-254.&lt;/ref&gt; His most prolific period of painting and drawing occurred between 1816 and 1831.

==Life==
Alken was born on 12 October 1785 in [[Soho]], [[Westminster]], and baptised on 6 November at [[St James's Church, Piccadilly]]. He was the third son of [[Samuel Alken]], a sporting artist. Two of his brothers were George and Samuel Alken the Younger, also an artist. In 1789, the Alken family moved from Soho to 2, Francis Street East, [[Bedford Square]].

Young Henry first studied under his father and then with the miniature painter [[John Thomas Barber Beaumont]] (1774–1841), also known as J. T. Barber.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=6462914 Henry Thomas Alken]  (Painting in England: 1700-1850, Collection of Mr and Mrs. Paul Mellon)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, Alken sent a miniature portrait of Miss Gubbins to the Royal Academy Exhibition. He exhibited a second miniature at the Royal Academy before abandoning miniature painting and taking on painting and illustrating. Early in his career, he painted sporting subjects under the name of "Ben Tally-O".&lt;ref name="neville"&gt;Ralph Neville,[https://archive.org/details/oldsportingprint00nevi Old Sporting Prints] in ''The Connoisseur magazine'', 1908&lt;/ref&gt; Alken married Maria Gordon on 14 October 1809 at St Clement’s Church, Ipswich. On 22 August of the following year later the couple's first son was baptised. Alken went on to father five children, of whom two were artists, Samuel Henry, also a sporting artist, known as Henry Alken junior, and Sefferien junior.

From about 1816 onwards Alken "produced an unending stream of paintings, drawings and engravings of every type of field and other sporting activity,"&lt;ref&gt;See text at [http://www.donaldheald.com/books/books_text_01.php?cat=Colour-Plate%20%26%20Illustrated Donald A. Heald (antique books)] under Alken, Henry Thomas, "Illustrations to popular songs".&lt;/ref&gt; and his soft-ground etchings were often colored by hand.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;Arthur M. Hind.[https://books.google.com/books?id=bxFb8nN_wUQC&amp;pg=PA237 A History of Engraving From the 15th Century to the Year 1914].&lt;/ref&gt; When Alken was 26, he and his young family lived over a shop in [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] that belonged to print publisher Thomas McLean of the "Repository of Wit and Humour."&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;  McLean paid Alken a daily wage of thirty shillings, considered a good income at the time.&lt;ref name="tatlock" /&gt;

Alken died in April 1851 and was buried in [[Highgate cemetery]]. Although fairly affluent for most of his career, he fell on hard times towards the end of his life and was buried at his daughter's expense.&lt;ref name="neville" /&gt;

==Work==
Alken worked in both [[oil painting|oil]] and [[watercolor]] and was a skilled [[etcher]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childsgallery.com/pub_pdf/11.pdf Child's Gallery: Painting Annual]&lt;/ref&gt; His earliest productions were published anonymously under the signature of "Ben Tallyho", but in 1816 he issued ''The Beauties &amp; Defects in the Figure of the Horse comparatively delineated'' under his own name. From this date until about 1831, he produced many sets of etchings of sporting subjects mostly coloured and sometimes humorous in character, the principal of which were: ''Humorous Specimens of Riding'' 1821, ''Symptoms of being amazed'' 1822, ''Symptoms of being amused'' 1822, ''Flowers from Nature'' 1823, ''A Touch at the Fine Arts'' 1824, and ''Ideas'' 1830. Besides these he published a series of books:  ''Illustrations for Landscape Scenery and Scraps from the Sketch Book of Henry Alken'' in 1823, ''New Sketch Book'' in 1824, ''Sporting Scrap Book'' and ''Shakespeare's Seven Ages'' in 1827, ''Sporting Sketches'' and in 1831 Illustrations to Popular Songs and Illustrations of Don Quixote, the latter engraved by John Christian Zeitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Alken, Henry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alken provided the plates picturing [[hunting]], coaching, [[racing]] and [[steeplechase (horse racing)|steeplechasing]] for ''The National Sports of Great Britain'' (London, 1821).&lt;ref&gt;Henry Thomas Alken. [https://archive.org/details/nationalsportsof00alke The National Sports of Great Britain] (New York: D. Appleton, 1903).&lt;/ref&gt; Alken, known as an avid sportsman,is best remembered for his hunting prints, many of which he engraved himself until the late 1830s. (Charles Lane British Racing Prints pp.&amp;nbsp;75–76). He created prints for the leading sporting printsellers such as S. and J. Fuller, Thomas McLean, and [[Rudolph Ackermann]], and often collaborated with his friend the sporting journalist [[Charles James Apperley]] (1779–1843), also known as Nimrod.&lt;ref&gt;Alken, Henry. "Military Duties, Occurrences etc. etc." (London: Thomas McLean, c. 1820-30).&lt;/ref&gt; Nimrod's ''Life of a Sportsman'', with 32 etchings by Alken, was published by Ackermann in 1842.&lt;ref name="history" /&gt; In many of his etchings, Alken explored the comic side of riding and satirized the foibles of aristocrats, much in the tradition of other early 19th century omthe oldest of the great foxhound packs in [[Leicestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icons.org.uk/theicons/collection/fox-hunting-and-the-ban/what-next/places-to-go Fox Hunting and the Ban] (icons.org.uk)&lt;/ref&gt; A collection of his illustrations can be seen in the print department of the [[British Museum]].

[[File:Horseshoe shaped wind chime with bells.jpg|thumb|right|upright|A horseshoe [[wind chime]], used as a [[good luck charm]]]]
'''[[Iron]]''' has a long and varied tradition in the mythology and folklore of the world.

==In Europe==
===Cold iron===
{{redirect|Cold Iron|the poem by Rudyard Kipling|Cold Iron (poem)}}
'''Cold iron''' is a poetic term for [[iron]].

[[Francis Grose|Francis Grose's]] ''1811 Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue'' defines cold iron as "A sword, or any other weapon for cutting or stabbing." This usage often appears as "cold steel" in modern parlance.

[[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "[[Cold Iron (poem)|Cold Iron]]", found in his 1910 collection of stories ''[[Rewards and Fairies]]'', used the term poetically to mean "weapon".

"Cold iron" is historically believed to repel, contain, or harm [[ghost]]s, [[fairy|fairies]], [[witch]]es, and other malevolent [[supernatural]] creatures.  This belief continued into later [[superstition]]s in a number of forms:

* Nailing an iron [[horseshoe]] to a [[door]] was said to repel [[evil spirit]]s or later, to bring good luck.
* Surrounding a [[cemetery]] with an iron [[fence]] was thought to contain the [[soul]]s of the [[dead]].
* Burying an iron [[knife]] under the entrance to one's [[house|home]] was alleged to keep [[witch]]es from entering.

In his novel ''[[Redgauntlet]]'', the [[Scotland|Scottish]] author [[Sir Walter Scott]] wrote, "Your wife's a witch, man; you should nail a horse-shoe on your chamber-door."

In modern fantasy, cold iron may refer to a special type of metal, such as meteoric iron or unworked metal. Weapons and implements made from cold iron are often granted special efficacy against creatures such as fairies and spirits.

===Horseshoes===
[[File:Horseshoe lucky on door.jpg|thumb|upright|A horseshoe on a door is regarded as a protective [[amulet|talisman]] in some cultures.]]

[[Horseshoe]]s are considered a good [[luck]] charm in many cultures, including those of England, Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;Thorpe, Benjamin (1851). ''Northern Mythology: Comprising the Principal Popular Traditions and Superstitions of Scandinavia, North Germany, and the Netherlands''. E. Lumley.&lt;/ref&gt; Lithuania, and Estonia, and its shape, fabrication, placement and manner of sourcing are all important. A common tradition is that if a horseshoe is hung on a door with the two ends pointing up (as shown here) then good luck will occur. However, if the two ends point downwards then bad luck will occur. Traditions do differ on this point, though. In some cultures, the horseshoe is hung ''points down'' (so the luck pours onto you); in others, it is hung ''points up'' (so the luck does not fall out); still in others it does not matter so long as the horseshoe has been used (not new), was found (not purchased), and can be touched. In all traditions, luck is ''contained'' in the shoe and can ''pour out'' through the ends.

In some traditions, any good or bad luck achieved will only occur to the ''owner'' of the horseshoe, not the person who hangs it up. Therefore, if the horseshoe was stolen, borrowed or even just found then the ''owner'', not the person who found or stole the horseshoe will get any good or bad luck. Other traditions require that the horseshoe be found to be effective.

[[File:Horseshoe and devil.svg|thumb|right|upright|Illustration by [[George Cruikshank]] for ''The True Legend of St. Dunstan and the Devil'']]
One reputed origin of the tradition of lucky horseshoes is the story of [[Dunstan|Saint Dunstan]] and the Devil. Dunstan, who would become the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in AD 959, was a blacksmith by trade. The story relates that he once nailed a horseshoe to the Devil's hoof when he was asked to reshoe the Devil's horse. This caused the Devil great pain, and Dunstan only agreed to remove the shoe and release the Devil after the Devil promised never to enter a place where a horseshoe is hung over the door.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The True Legend of St. Dunstan and the Devil: Showing How the Horse-Shoe Came to Be a Charm Against Witchcraft |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/13978 |author=Edward G. Flight |location=London |year=1871 |edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory concerning the placing of horseshoes above doorways is to ward off [[Faeries]]; the theory being that supernatural beings are repelled by iron and as horseshoes were an easily available source of iron, they could be nailed above a door to prevent any unwanted, otherworldly guests.

==Meteoric iron in Tibet==
'''''[[Thogcha]]''''' ({{bo|t=ཐོག་ལྕགས|w=thog lcags}})&lt;ref&gt;Bellezza, John Vincent (March, 1999). ''Thogchags: The Ancient Amulets of Tibet.'' Source: [http://www.asianart.com/articles/thogchags/index.html] (accessed: Wednesday April 14, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; means 'sky-iron' in Tibetan.  [[Meteoric iron]] was highly prized throughout the Himalayas where it was included in sophisticated polymetallic alloys for ritual implements such as the [[singing bowl]] (Jansen, 1992) and [[phurba]] (Müller-Ebeling, ''et al.'', 2002).

Beer (1999: p.&amp;nbsp;234) holds that:

{{quote|Meteoric iron or "sky-iron" (Tib. gnam lcags) is the supreme substance for forging the physical representation of the [[vajra]] or other iron weapons, since it has already been tempered by the celestial gods in its passage across the heavens.  The indivisibility of form and emptiness is a perfect metaphor for the image of a meteorite or "stone fallen from the sky", manifesting out of the voidness of space as a shooting star or fireball, and depositing a chunk of fused "sky iron" on the earth below. Many vajras held by deities as weapons are described as being forged from meteorite iron, and Tibet, with its high altitude, thin atmosphere and desolate landscape, received an abundance of meteorite fragments. Tibetan vajras were often cast from meteorite iron, and as an act of sympathetic magic a piece of the meteoric iron was often returned to its original site.&lt;ref&gt;Beer, Robert (1999). ''The Encyclopedia of Tibetan Symbols and Motifs'' (Hardcover). Shambhala. {{ISBN|1-57062-416-X}}, {{ISBN|978-1-57062-416-2}}.

The [[Latter Day Saint movement]]  teaches that [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]] was the mother of [[Jesus]], whose father was [[God the Father]]. Latter Day Saints affirm the [[virgin birth of Jesus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first= Eleanor |last= Colton |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/4311 |contribution= Virgin Birth |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York, NY |publisher= Macmillan Publishing Co. |year= 1992 |volume= 4 |page= 1510}}&lt;/ref&gt; but reject the Roman Catholic traditions of the [[Immaculate Conception]], the [[perpetual virginity of Mary]], and her [[Assumption of Mary|assumption]]. They also believe that the [[brothers of Jesus]] were her and [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]]'s biological children.&lt;ref name = EOM&gt;{{citation |first= Camille |last= Fronk |contribution-url= http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/EoM/id/3906 |contribution= Mary, Mother of Jesus |title= [[Encyclopedia of Mormonism]] |location= New York, NY |publisher= Macmillan Publishing Co. |year= 1992 |volume= 2 |pages= 863–64 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mary is not seen as an intercessor between humankind and Jesus, and Latter Day Saints do not pray to Mary.&lt;ref name = EOM/&gt; The [[Book of Mormon]], part of the [[Standard Works|Latter Day Saint canon of scripture]], refers to Mary by name in prophecies of her mission,&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Mosiah|mosiah|3|8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and describes her as "most beautiful and fair above all other virgins"&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|1 Nephi|1-ne|11|13|20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a "precious and chosen vessel."&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Alma|alma|7|10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first edition of the Book of Mormon (1830), Mary was referred to as "the mother of God, after the manner of the flesh,"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= [[The Book of Mormon]] |location= Palmyra, NY |publisher= E.B. Grandin |year= 1830 |page= 25}}. [http://www.inephi.com/25.htm Online reprint] at ''inephi.com'' by John Hajicek.&lt;/ref&gt; a reading that was changed by [[Joseph Smith]] to "the mother of the Son of God" in subsequent editions (1837–).&lt;ref&gt; {{lds|1 Nephi|1-ne|11|18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latter Day Saint author [[Hugh Nibley]] has argued that the change was made to "avoid confusion, since during the theological controversies of the early Middle Ages the expression 'mother of God' took on a special connotation which it still has for many Christians". ({{citation |url= http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/books/?bookid=74&amp;chapid=909 |chapter= 'There Can Be No More Bible' |title= Since Cumorah |edition= 2nd |location= Salt Lake City, UT |publisher= [[Deseret Book]] and [[FARMS]] |year= 1988 |origyear= 1967 |page= 6 |isbn= 0-87579-139-5 |oclc= 17618853 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Latter Day Saints also believe that God the Father is the literal father of Jesus Christ,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url= http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-11-the-life-of-christ?lang=eng |chapter= Chapter 11: The Life of Christ |title= [[Gospel Principles]] |location= Salt Lake City, UT |publisher= LDS Church |year= 2009 |page= 52–53 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although how Jesus' conception was accomplished has not been authoritatively established.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Robert L.

The status of traditional handmade dolls (Layli or Bavig) in Lurish folklore. Svailable online at:http://anthropology.ir/article/29097.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name Layli is originated from the [[middle east]] folklore and love story; [[Layla and Majnun]]. Layli is the symbol of the beloved who is spiritually beautiful.&lt;ref&gt;Azimpour, P. 2010. Farhang-e Aroosak-ha va Namayesh-haye Aroosaki-e Aeeni va Sonati-e Iran(Iranian Ritual and Traditional Puppets and Puppet Shows Dictionary). Tehran: Namayesh.Page:554&lt;/ref&gt; The name Bavig (Bahig) in [[Lurish]] means bride. The word refers to the femininity, youth and vitality of this puppet character.

==Structure and function==
[[File:Layli (Lurish doll) from Mamasani, Iran.jpg|thumb|right| Layli dolls from [[Mamasani County|Mamasani]], [[Iran]]]]
Children can make the doll dance by pulling a string that is tied to their hands. The structure of this hinged doll is simple and noteworthy. Natural materials are used except for the embellishments such as sequins, glass beads and colourful ribbons. [[Dolls]], [[puppets]] and [[masks]] allow ordinary people to state what is impossible in the real situation;&lt;ref&gt;Baird, B. 2002. Honar-e Arousaki (The Art of the Puppet).Translated to Persian by Javad Zolfaghari.Tehran: Nowruz-e Honar.&lt;/ref&gt; for example in the [[Qajar era]] in Iran, people criticised the politics and social conditions of Ahmad-Shah's reign via puppetry without any fear of punishment.&lt;ref&gt;Beyza'i, Bahram. 2004. Iranian theatre. Tehran: Roshangaran. page:98&lt;/ref&gt; Leyli also represents and maintains a cultural tradition, which is gradually vanishing in urban life. Indeed, as they moved from villages to the cities to enhance their living standards, women gradually began to wear the chador and manto (Iranian 
public overalls) as general outer garments, with a limited range of colours. This has led to uniformity among the newcomers in the city who were originally from different tribes.

'''Theatre festivals''' are amongst the earliest types of festival. Classical Greek theatre was associated with religious festivals dedicated to [[Dionysus]], called the City Dionysia. The medieval [[mystery play]]s were presented at the major Christian feasts. Theatre as an everyday part of life is a comparatively recent phenomenon.

In recent years, theatre festivals have been established to promote various types of theatre, such as the works of [[William Shakespeare]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]]. Many festivals, such as those in the [[fringe theatre]] movement, promote the work of beginning playwrights (called "new writing") and performers.

This is a list of [[theatre festivals]] around the world:

'''''Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game''''' is a book by [[Michael Lewis]], published in 2003, about the [[Oakland Athletics]] baseball team and its [[general manager (baseball)|general manager]] [[Billy Beane]]. Its focus is the team's [[Analytics|analytical]], evidence-based, [[sabermetric]] approach to assembling a competitive [[baseball]] team despite Oakland's small budget. [[Moneyball (film)|A film]] based on the book, starring [[Brad Pitt]] and [[Jonah Hill]], was released in 2011.

==Synopsis==
The central premise of ''Moneyball'' is that the collective wisdom of baseball insiders (including players, managers, coaches, scouts, and the [[front office]]) over the past century is subjective and often flawed. Statistics such as [[stolen base]]s, [[run batted in|runs batted in]], and [[batting average]], typically used to gauge players, are relics of a 19th-century view of the game and the statistics available at that time. Before sabermetrics was introduced to baseball, teams were dependent on the skills of their scouts to find and evaluate players. Scouts are experienced in the sport, usually having been players or coaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Study of Sabermetrics in Major League Baseball: The Impact of Moneyball on Free Agent Salaries|url=http://olinblog.wustl.edu/wp-content/uploads/AStudyofSabermetricsinMajorLeagueBaseball.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book argues that the Oakland A's' front office took advantage of more analytical gauges of player performance to field a team that could better compete against richer competitors in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB).

Rigorous statistical analysis had demonstrated that [[on-base percentage]] and [[slugging percentage]] are better indicators of offensive success, and the A's became convinced that these qualities were cheaper to obtain on the open market than more historically valued qualities such as speed and contact. These observations often flew in the face of conventional baseball wisdom and the beliefs of many baseball scouts and executives.

By re-evaluating their strategy in this way, the [[2002 Oakland Athletics season|2002 Athletics]], with approximately $44 million in salary, were competitive with larger market teams such as the [[New York Yankees]], who spent over $125 million in payroll that season. Because of its smaller budget, Oakland had to find players undervalued by the market, and their system has proven itself thus far. The approach brought the A's to the playoffs in 2002 and 2003.

Lewis explored several themes in the book, such as insiders vs. outsiders (established traditionalists vs. upstart proponents of [[sabermetrics]]), the democratization of information causing a flattening of hierarchies, and "the ruthless drive for efficiency that [[capitalism]] demands". The book also touches on Oakland's underlying economic need to stay ahead of the curve; as other teams begin mirroring Beane's strategies to evaluate offensive talent, diminishing the Athletics' advantage, Oakland begins looking for other undervalued baseball skills, such as defensive capabilities.

[[File:MONEYBALLchart.png|thumb|left|467px|Distribution of team salaries in 2002. Team salaries ranged from about $35 million (the [[Tampa Bay Devil Rays]]) to about $120 million (the [[New York Yankees]])&lt;br&gt; The [[Oakland Athletics]] had the third-lowest team payroll in the league (about $40 million) marginally higher than that of the [[Montreal Expos]], whose franchise was transferred to the Washington Nationals in 2005.]]

''Moneyball'' also touches on the A's' methods of prospect selection. Sabermetricians argue that a [[college baseball]] player's chance of MLB success is much higher than a traditional high school draft pick. Beane maintains that high draft picks spent on high school prospects, regardless of talent or physical potential as evaluated by traditional scouting, are riskier than those spent on more polished college players. Lewis cites A's minor leaguer [[Jeremy Bonderman]], drafted out of high school in 2001 over Beane's objections, as an example of the type of draft pick Beane would avoid. Bonderman had all of the traditional "tools" that scouts look for, but thousands of such players have been signed by MLB organizations out of high school over the years and failed to develop. Lewis explores the A's approach to the [[2002 Major League Baseball draft|2002 MLB draft]], when the team had a run of early picks. The book documents Beane's often tense discussions with his scouting staff (who favored traditional subjective evaluation of potential rather than objective sabermetrics) in preparation for the draft to the actual draft, which defied all expectations and was considered at the time a wildly successful (if unorthodox) effort by Beane.

''Moneyball'' traces the history of the sabermetric movement back to such people as [[Bill James]] (now a member of the [[Boston Red Sox]] [[front office]]) and [[Craig R. Wright]]. Lewis explores how James's seminal ''[[Baseball Abstract]]'', published annually from the late 1970s through the late 1980s, influenced many of the young, up-and-coming baseball minds that are now joining the ranks of baseball management.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

==Impact==
''Moneyball'' has entered baseball's lexicon; teams that value sabermetrics are often said to be playing "''Moneyball''." Baseball traditionalists, in particular some scouts and media members, decry the sabermetric revolution and have disparaged ''Moneyball'' for emphasizing sabermetrics over more traditional methods of player evaluation. Nevertheless, ''Moneyball'' changed the way many major league front offices do business. In its wake, teams such as the [[New York Mets]], [[New York Yankees]], [[San Diego Padres]], [[St. Louis Cardinals]], [[Boston Red Sox]], [[Washington Nationals]], [[Arizona Diamondbacks]], [[Cleveland Indians]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woolner |first=Keith |url=http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6187 |title=Articles &amp;#124; Aim For The Head: Aim For the Front Office |publisher=Baseball Prospectus |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]  have hired full-time [[Sabermetrician|sabermetric analysts]].

When the Mets hired [[Sandy Alderson]] &amp;ndash; Beane's predecessor and mentor with the A's &amp;ndash; as their general manager after the 2010 season, and hired Beane's former associates [[Paul DePodesta]] and [[J.P. Ricciardi]] to the front office, the team was jokingly referred to as the "Moneyball Mets".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://nymag.com/news/sports/games/sandy-alderson-2011-4/ |title = The Moneyball Mets |publisher = [[New York (magazine)|New York]] |date = 25 March 2011 |accessdate = 2011-04-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the Oakland A's in the 1990s, the Mets have been directed by their ownership to slash payroll. Under Alderson's tenure, the team payroll dropped below $100 million per year from 2012 to 2014, and the Mets reached the [[2015 World Series]] (defeating MLB's highest-payroll team, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], en route).

Lewis has acknowledged that the book's success may have hurt the Athletics' fortunes as other teams accepted sabermetrics, reducing Oakland's edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2011/09/18/SP3J1L571K.DTL&amp;ao=all |title = Michael Lewis on A's 'Moneyball' legacy |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date = 18 September 2011 |accessdate = 2011-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daryl Morey]]'s own unorthodox approaches in the NBA have been called "Moreyball".

Since the book's publication and success, Lewis has discussed plans for a sequel to ''Moneyball'' called ''Underdogs'', revisiting the players and their relative success several years into their careers, although only four players from the 2002 draft played much at the Major League level.

==People discussed in the book==
''Moneyball'' also covers the lives and careers of several baseball personalities. The central one is [[Billy Beane]], whose failed playing career is contrasted with wildly optimistic predictions by scouts.

Players and people discussed in ''Moneyball'':

===Oakland farm system===
[[Image:Swisher.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Nick Swisher]], the prospect the traditional scouts and statisticians agreed upon.]]
*[[Barry Zito]] – [[2002 Major League Baseball season|2002]] [[American League|AL]] [[Cy Young Award|Cy Young winner]], part of the "Big 3" with Mulder and Hudson (below)
*[[Mark Mulder]] – part of the "Big 3" with Zito and Hudson
*[[Tim Hudson]] – Not drafted by Beane; part of the "Big 3" with Mulder and Zito
*[[Kirk Saarloos]]
*[[John Baker (baseball)|John Baker]]
*[[Joe Blanton]]
*[[Jason Giambi]] – Not drafted by Beane. [[2000 Major League Baseball season|2000]] AL [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]], signed with the [[New York Yankees]] in 2002 for $120 million over 7 years
*[[Miguel Tejada]] – Not drafted by Beane; 2002 AL MVP
*[[Eric Chavez]] – Not drafted by Beane; six-time AL [[Rawlings Gold Glove Award|Gold Glove winner]]
*[[Jeremy Brown]]
*[[Nick Swisher]]
*[[Bobby Crosby]]
*[[Mark Teahen]]
*[[Jeremy Bonderman]] – traded to the [[Detroit Tigers]] in 2002

===Oakland bullpen===
*[[Jason Isringhausen]] – signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2001–02 offseason
*[[Billy Koch]] – 2002 AL Relief Pitcher of the Year
*[[Chad Bradford]]
*[[Jim Mecir]]
*[[Ricardo Rincón]]
*[[Mike Magnante]]

===Other players===
[[File:KevinYouklis.jpg|thumb|right|220px|[[Kevin Youkilis]]]]
*[[Kevin Youkilis]] – referred to in the book as the "Greek God of Walks". Youkilis was drafted in 2001 by the [[Boston Red Sox]] and heavily desired by Beane, who tried to snare him via a failed three-team trade discussed in the book.
*[[Prince Fielder]] – son of former [[slugging percentage|slugger]] [[Cecil Fielder]], drafted in 2002 year by the [[Milwaukee Brewers]]. Claimed by Beane to be "too fat" even for the A's.
*B. J. Upton, now known by his birth name of [[Melvin Upton, Jr.]] – cited as an example of "bad [[high school]]" draft pick.
*[[Scott Kazmir]] – cited as an example of teams' – in this case the [[New York Mets]] – foolishness in drafting high school [[pitcher]]s because of the difficulty in projecting their future, as opposed to college players.
*[[Jamie Moyer]] – then with the [[Seattle Mariners]]
*[[Ray Durham]] – traded to the Oakland A's in the middle of 2002, cited as a potent base-stealer and "rent-a-player": an impending free agent who would likely attract large offers from other clubs with larger available payrolls than Oakland's while leaving Oakland with draft picks in the next year's draft, a rule since abolished with the 2011 [[Major League Baseball Collective Bargaining Agreement]]. Durham would eventually sign with the [[San Francisco Giants]].
*[[Terrence Long]]
*[[Erik Hiljus]]
*[[David Justice]]
*[[Jeremy Giambi]]
*[[Alex Rodriguez]] – Beane compares A-Rod's stats to those of [[Eric Chavez]].

*[[David Forst]] – scout
*[[Grady Fuson]] – Head of scouting
*[[Ron "Hoppy" Hopkins]] – National cross-checker scout
*[[Chris Pittaro]] – scout
*[[J. P. Ricciardi]] – worked under Beane and DePodesta as Director of Player Personnel
*[[Sandy Alderson]] – Beane's predecessor and mentor with the Athletics
*[[Peter Gammons]] – Sportswriter
*[[Art Howe]] – [[List of Oakland Athletics managers|Oakland manager]]
*[[Ron Washington]] – Athletics coach
*[[Joe Morgan]] – [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] second baseman and ESPN broadcaster

*[[Bill James]] – baseball writer and statistician whose ''Baseball Abstract'' books greatly influenced Beane
*[[Omar Minaya]] – Montreal Expos GM

== Reception ==
[[Richard Thaler|Richard H. Thaler]] of the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business and Cass R. Sunstein of the University of Chicago Law School described the book as a "sensation... Lewis has a wonderful story to tell, and he tells it wonderfully... Lewis also raises some serious puzzles that he does not resolve, and his account has some large and perhaps profound implications that he does not much explore."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/61123/whos-first|title=Who's On First|date=2003-09-01|website=New Republic|access-date=2017-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Haglund of [[Slate Magazine|Slate]] and [[Jonah Keri]] of [[Grantland]] have both criticized the book for glossing over key young talent acquired through the draft and signed internationally. Specifically, they have argued that the book ignores the pitching trio of [[Tim Hudson]], [[Mark Mulder]], and [[Barry Zito]], as well as position players such as [[Eric Chavez]] and [[Miguel Tejada]], all of whom were discovered via traditional scouting methodology and were key contributors to the success of the 2002 Athletics. In 2002, Barry Zito received the [[AL Cy Young Award]] and Miguel Tejada received the [[AL MVP Award]].

==Film==
{{Main article|Moneyball (film)}}
A movie based on the book was released in 2011. Actor [[Brad Pitt]] stars as [[Billy Beane]], while [[Jonah Hill]] plays a fictional character based on [[Paul DePodesta]]; [[Philip Seymour Hoffman]] plays A's manager [[Art Howe]]. [[Academy Award]]-winning screenwriter [[Steve Zaillian]] was hired to write the script, and [[Steven Soderbergh]] was slated to direct, replacing [[David Frankel]].&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, Tatiana. [http://www.variety.com/VR1117994175.html "Columbia pitches ''Moneyball'' to Pitt", Variety (October 16, 2008).]&lt;/ref&gt; But in June 2009, because of conflicts over a revised script by Soderbergh, Sony put the movie on hold just days before it was scheduled to begin shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4278999 |title="Benched: 'Moneyball' Flick on Hold at Last Minute", Associated Press (June 22, 2009) |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-06-22 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soderbergh was eventually let go.

[[Bennett Miller]] took over directing duties,&lt;ref name="deadline.com"&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming |first=Mike |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/04/finally-its-batter-up-for-moneyball/ |title="Finally, It's Batter Up For 'Moneyball,'" Deadline.com (April 12, 2010) |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aaron Sorkin]] rewrote the script.&lt;ref name="deadline.com"/&gt;  Shooting began in July 2010 at Blair Field, the Sports Stadium for Wilson High School (Long Beach, California), Sony Studios in Culver City, Dodger Stadium, and the Oakland-Alameda Coliseum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/entertainment&amp;id=7575771 |title="'Moneyball' begins filming in Oakland", ABC7 KGO-TV San Francisco, California (July 27, 2010) |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2010-07-27 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/entertainmentnewsbuzz/2010/09/moneyball-films-scenes-in-dodger-stadium.html |title='Moneyball' films scenes in Dodger Stadium| work =  Los Angeles Times |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in theaters on September 23, 2011. ''Moneyball'' was nominated for six [[Academy Awards]], including [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]].

==In popular culture==
The book is parodied in the ''[[The Simpsons|Simpsons]]'' episode "[[MoneyBART]]", in which [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] manages [[Bart Simpson|Bart]]'s [[Little League]] baseball team using sabermetric principles. [[Bill James]] made an appearance in this episode.

{{double image|right|Square-in-a-square quilt block.png|100|Kitchen kaleid.PNG|100|Square-in-a-square quilt block pattern|Kitchen kaleidoscope quilt block example}}

In the [[textile arts]], a '''motif''' {{audio|en-us-motif.ogg|(pronunciation)}} (also called a block or square) is a smaller element in a much larger work. In [[knitting]] and [[crochet]],  motifs are made one at a time and joined together to create larger works such as [[afghan blanket]]s or shawls. An example of a motif is the [[granny square]]. Motifs may be varied or rotated for contrast and variety, or to create new shapes, as with quilt blocks in [[quilt]]s and [[quilting]]. Contrast with motif-less [[crazy quilting]].

Motifs can be any size, but usually all the motifs in any given work are the same size. The patterns and stitches used in a motif may vary greatly, but there is almost always some unifying element, such as texture, stitch pattern, or colour, which gives the finished piece more aesthetic appeal. Motifs may commemorate events or convey information or political slogans. For example, the individual blocks of the [[AIDS Memorial Quilt]], the possible [[Quilts of the Underground Railroad]], and the "[[Oregon boundary dispute|54-40 or Fight]]" quilt block.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://earlywomenmasters.net/quilts/f/54_40/index.html 54-40 or Fight] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070107232458/http://earlywomenmasters.net/quilts/f/54_40/index.html |date=2007-01-07 }}", ''Antique Geometric Quilt Designs''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Oscar Wilde Memorial Sculpture''''' is a collection of three statues in [[Merrion Square]] in [[Dublin]], Ireland, commemorating Irish poet and playwright [[Oscar Wilde]]. The sculptures were unveiled in 1997 and were designed and made by [[Danny Osborne]].  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/DublinArtInParks/English |title=Oscar Wilde Memorial Sculpture |publisher=Dublin City Council |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Statue of Oscar Wilde and companion pieces.jpg|right|thumb|Statue and companion pieces]]

English sculptor Danny Osborne was commissioned by the [[Guinness Brewery|Guinness Ireland Group]] to create a statue commemorating Oscar Wilde, which was unveiled in 1997, by Wilde's grandson Merlin Holland.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/4042930/Sculpting_Irishness_A_Discussion_of_Dublins_Commemorative_Statues_of_Oscar_Wilde_and_Phil_Lynott|title=Sculpting Irishness: a discussion of Dublin&amp;#39;s commemorative statues of Oscar Wilde and Phil Lynott |first=Smith |last=Sarah|publisher=|journal=Sculpture Journal|volume=21|year=2012|accessdate=16 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial budget of [[Irish pound|IR£]]20,000 was later increased to IR£45,000.&lt;ref name=it&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18986554.html |title=Chasing ghosts |work=The Sunday Herald |url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since [[marble]] alone was deemed inadequate, the statue was formed from different coloured stones from three continents.&lt;ref name=jj /&gt; The torso is of green [[nephrite jade]] from [[British Columbia]], Canada, and pink [[thulite]] from Norway.&lt;ref name=trin&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trinitynews.ie/the-surprising-geology-of-dublins-oscar-wilde-statue/ |title=The surprising geology of Dublin’s Oscar Wilde statue |publisher=Trinity News |date=22 January 2014 |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legs are of Norwegian [[granite|Blue Pearl granite]] with the shoes being black Indian [[charnockite]] and finished with bronze shoelace tips.&lt;ref name=trin /&gt; The statue also wears a [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] tie made from glazed [[porcelain]], and three rings – Wilde's wedding ring and two [[Scarab (artifact)|scarab]]s, one for good luck, the other for bad luck.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;

The statue is mounted with Wilde reclining on a large [[quartz]] boulder obtained by Osborne himself from the [[Wicklow Mountains]].&lt;ref name=trin /&gt; The sculpture also includes two pillars flanking the boulder with one pillar having a nude pregnant representation of Wilde's wife [[Constance Lloyd]] on top. The other one has a male torso representing [[Dionysus]], the Greek God of drama and wine, atop it. Both flanking sculptures are in [[bronze]] and [[granite]],&lt;ref name=smith/&gt; and both pillars have inscriptions from Wilde's poems carved onto them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Geoff |last=Wallis |title=The Rough Guide to Dublin |page=61 |publisher=Rough Guides |year=2002 |isbn=1858289130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inscriptions of the quotes copy
the personal handwriting of figures including [[Seamus Heaney]], [[John B. Keane]] and [[Michael D. Higgins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dublincity.ie/sites/default/files/content/RecreationandCulture/DublinCityParks/Documents/ArtinParksFinalPDF.pdf|title=Art in Parks|publisher=Dublin City Council|date=2014|accessdate=24 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three people, living at the time near to the artist's West Cork studio, posed as models for the three sculptures.

When the statue was unveiled in 1997, it was the first statue commemorating Wilde, who had died 97 years earlier. It received near unanimous praise for the materials used and for its location near his childhood home at 1, [[Merrion Square]].&lt;ref name=it /&gt; In 2010, the porcelain head of Wilde had to be replaced because cracks were forming on it. The porcelain head was replaced by a new one made of white [[jadeite]].&lt;ref name=jj&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-26354523.html |title=A geological odyssey for Oscar as Wilde gets a new jade head |work=The Irish Times |url-access=subscription |via=[[HighBeam Research]] |date= |accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact and significance ==
In a May 2001 article in the Irish edition of ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' Mark Keenan commented on the surprisingly long wait for a commemoration of Wilde in his native city and suggested an explanation for the delay, "... a decade ago, more conservative elements among the Dublin public may not have dared allow his city to commemorate his name."&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, Mark, "Take a walk on the Wildeside of Merrion Square", ''[[The Sunday Times]] (Irish edition), 20 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Art historian Paula Murphy agreed, saying, "It has taken nearly one hundred years for an Irish body, public or private, to risk suggesting that we might consider Oscar Wilde worthy of such commemoration. But then it has taken the same length of time for Ireland to awaken, reluctantly, to the existence of sexuality and the reality of the way in which it dictates a lifestyle."&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Paula. "The Quare on the Square: a statue of Oscar Wilde for Dublin", in Jerusha McCormack (ed), 1998. ''Wilde the Irishman'', New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; It took as long for London, where Wilde spent most of his adult life, to commemorate the dramatist: [[Maggi Hambling]]'s ''[[A Conversation with Oscar Wilde]]'' was unveiled in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=London's Wilde tribute|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/224663.stm|accessdate=20 May 2018|work=news.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|date=November 30, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing the work in her 2012 article "Sculpting Irishness: a discussion of Dublin&amp;#39;s commemorative statues of Oscar Wilde and Phil Lynott" for ''Sculpture Journal'', Sarah Smith writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Another distinction is the figure's facial expression, which, disrupting the realism of the figure, might be described as a rather contorted sneer. Intended by the artist to represent two antithetical sides of Wilde, one half of his face is smiling widely ... while the other bears a sombre expression ... and this divide is echoed in his posture on either side. Because of its positioning at the corner of the park on the turn of the outer pathway, the visitor to the monument sees one side of Wilde when approaching and another when walking away. One is the witty Wilde who is most often remembered in popular culture, the other the "broken man" he became following his two-year incarceration for committing homosexual acts.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Smith argues "we cannot help but read this work according to today’s conventions of dress and gesture", saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The choice of pose for Wilde, which invokes familiar art historical and popular images of 'feminized masculinity', the use of colour for this ‘colourful character’ and his gaze directed at the nude male torso all coalesce with our knowledge of his homosexuality. We consequently see an overemphasis on his sexuality in this work, augmented by the nicknames given to it by Dubliners.&lt;ref name=smith/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''''Pandora's Tower'''''{{efn|Known in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Pandora's Tower: Until I Return to Your Side'''''|パンドラの塔 君のもとへ帰るまで|Pandora no Tō: Kimi no Moto e Kaeru Made}}&lt;!-- See [[WP:JFN]] --&gt;}} is an [[action role-playing game]] developed by [[Ganbarion]] for the [[Wii]]. The game released in May 2011 in Japan, April 2012 in [[PAL region|PAL]] territories, and April 2013 in North America: while [[Marvelous USA|Xseed Games]] published the game in North America, Nintendo was the publisher in all other regions. Focusing on the efforts of protagonist Aeron to rid his love Elena of a curse that is turning her into a monster, the player explores thirteen towers, solving environmental puzzles and taking part in platforming while battling enemies&amp;mdash;a key part of gameplay is the Oraclos Chain, a weapon that aids in both combat and navigation. Depending on the strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena, multiple endings can be reached.

Development began in 2006 following the completion of ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]'' as Ganbarion's first original title. The main concept was born from the desire to create a game scenario based around purification and love. Character numbers and plot twists were kept to a minimum to focus attention on Elena's plight. Due to recurring problems implementing the relationship mechanics and working with the Wii's controls, ''Pandora's Tower'' went through an extended development period. Despite releasing in Europe, Nintendo did not plan a North American release: prior to the announcement of Xseed Games picking up the title, a fan campaign called [[Operation Rainfall]] drew considerable attention to the title. Upon release, ''Pandora's Tower'' had modest commercial success and was met with mixed to positive reviews; praise went to the story and elements of combat, while the control scheme and graphics were faulted.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Pandora's Tower screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Main character Aeron solving a puzzle inside one of the Thirteen Towers.]]
''Pandora's Tower'' is an [[action role-playing game]] where players take the role of Aeron as he explores a fortress called the Thirteen Towers, suspended above a ravine known as the Scar, on a quest to cure his lover Elena of a curse.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/RVL/EUR/SX3P/SX3P_R.pdf|title=Pandora's Tower European Manual|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|accessdate=3 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161117154538/http://m1.nintendo.net/docvc/RVL/EUR/SX3P/SX3P_R.pdf|archivedate=17 November 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"/&gt; Aeron can be controlled through both the [[Wii Remote]] and [[Wii Nunchuk|Nunchuk]] or the [[Classic Controller]]. The base from which Aeron explores the Thirteen Towers is the Observatory, a building on the edge of the Scar. In the Observatory, Aeron can save his progress, and interact with Elena and the merchant Mavda.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; The main objective when inside the Thirteen Towers is the reach the Masters, powerful monsters housed at the top of each tower in a locked room which act as the game's bosses. These rooms must be accessed by solving puzzles throughout each Tower to unlock the door. On his way through the Towers, Aeron must fight numerous smaller enemies: he can perform a basic melee attack, and a charged attack which deals higher damage and will trigger additional attacks if the player times a button press with the appearance of a targeting ring around Aeron.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comv4u/pandoras_tower_gameplay_details/|title=Pandora's Tower Gameplay Details|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=3 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418235436/http://andriasang.com/comv4u/pandoras_tower_gameplay_details/|archivedate=18 April 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;

Aeron's main weapon is the Oraclos Chain, an artifact that can be used in multiple ways: it can tie up enemies, bind enemies together so they share damage taken when Aeron attacks, and swing them around Aeron to deal damage. The Chain can also be used to rip armor or materials from enemies. The Chain's attack power increases the longer it is pulled when attached to an enemy. In addition to the Oraclos Chain, Aeron has access to multiple subweapons, such as a sword.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comvbh/pandoras_tower_weapons/|title=The Weapons of Pandora's Tower|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=28 April 2011|accessdate=3 December 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121225044851/http://andriasang.com/comvbh/pandoras_tower_weapons/|archivedate=25 December 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Puzzles within the Towers include activating levers and switches, manipulating platforms, triggering special mechanisms unique to each Tower environment, and climbing along walls and beams to reach other areas within the Towers. The Chain is essential to these puzzles, being used as a grappling hook and a rope from which Aeron can swing from one platform to another. Elements within the Towers, such as what enemies are active and what items may be found, vary with the time of day Aeron visits them.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;

While Aeron is within the Towers, a time counter is displayed, showing the advancement of Elena's curse. As Aeron defeats both normal enemies and the Masters of each Tower, he gathers flesh from them which he must give to Elena to eat and reverse the curse's effects, resetting the timer: the amount of reversion is dependent on the quality of flesh, which deteriorates over time after being extracted. Elena's state is also tied to the Affinity gauge; giving her flesh, talking with her, giving her gifts and asking her to help with tasks raise the meter, but delaying reverting Elena's transformation causes it to decrease.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; The strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena directly impacts the game's ending.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; Items and equipment are created and stored in the Observatory, with Mavda using materials brought back from the Towers to create new equipment for Aeron. She can also repair equipment that has been damaged in combat while equipped to Aeron, and upgrade existing weapons and equipment with new materials.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; If the time limit is exceeded and Elena completes her transformation, or Aeron falls in battle, the game ends and restarts from the last active save.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting and characters===
''Pandora's Tower'' is set on the fictional continent of Imperia: once divided into ten kingdoms, the now-nomadic Vestra tribe were stripped of their kingdom. The dominant religion of Imperia is Aios, a polytheistic system worshiping nature as personified by twelve deities. Though once united through the ancient War of Unification which began the Unified Era, Imperia has seen recent conflicts as three kingdoms sought to break free from the powerful kingdom of Elyria.&lt;ref name="PandoraAndriaSetting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraGuide"/&gt;

During the game's present, the war has ended but tensions are still high on both sides. The game's primary setting is the Okanos region at the Thirteen Towers, a giant fortress suspended above a giant chasm called the Scar, held in place by thirteen giant chains said to keep the Scar from growing. Initially built five centuries before, a disastrous magical experiment caused the Towers to be infested by monsters. Fifty years prior to the start of the game, a new experiment involving the monsters triggers the Scar's creation.&lt;ref name="PandoraManual"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraAndriaSetting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://andriasang.com/comut4/pandoras_tower_story/|title=Pandora's Tower Background Story|last=Gantayat|first=Anoop|publisher=Andriasang.com|date=6 April 2011|accessdate=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304054616/http://andriasang.com/comut4/pandoras_tower_story/|archivedate=4 March 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraGuide"&gt;{{cite book|script-title=ja:パンドラの塔 君のもとへ帰るまで: 任天堂公式ガイドブック|trans-title=Pandora's Tower: Until I Return to Your Side: Nintendo Official Guidebook|publisher=[[Shogakukan]] |isbn=4-09-106485-X |language=Japanese |date=1 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main protagonist is Aeron, a former soldier from the kingdom of Athos. Three years prior to the start of the game, a wounded Aeron was given shelter by Elena, an Elyrian. Despite their countries being at war, Elena nurses him and the two eventually became lovers. They are accompanied on their journey to the Thirteen Towers by Mavda, a woman of the Vestra tribe who is the current guardian of the Towers. Her tribe have the ability to manipulate the chains of fate, and gives Aeron the Oraclos Chain weapon to both aid him in his quest and maintain a connection with Elena.&lt;ref name="PandoraAndriaSetting"/&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoraGuide"/&gt;

===Plot===
While singing at Elyria's Harvest Festival, Elena is struck by a curse that forces her to flee the Elyrian army with Aeron. They are led by Mavda to the Thirteen Towers, with Elena having been partially transformed into a monster by this point. Mavda reveals that the only way to lift the curse from Elena and prevent her transformation is to feed her the flesh of "Masters", powerful beings living inside the Towers. Given the Oraclos Chain, Aeron explores the Towers and kills each of its Masters, returning to give their flesh to Elena. Each time she eats Master Flesh, she receives visions detailing the events behind the Towers' creations. Five hundred years before, in an attempt to end the War of Unification, the people of Elyria and the Vestra decided to embody the twelve deities of Impedia in physical forms&amp;mdash;the Towers' Masters&amp;mdash;with a thirteenth vessel providing balance between them in a project dubbed Experiment Zero.&lt;ref name="QUOTEgame"&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A husband and wife who had lost their son as a result of the war offered themselves as the raw material of the final Master, but the woman's unknown pregnancy caused an imbalance that transformed the Masters into monsters. The husband and baby were rescued using the Oraclos Chain, but the wife became Zeron, a dark monster consumed with a want to reunite with her descendant and bring 'peace' to the land. The Vestra sealed the Masters in the Towers and guarded them, while the wife's child eventually became Aeron's ancestor. The wife's jealous want of her descendants caused her to curse people who grew close to them, with Elena being the latest victim of the curse. The Vestra brought each afflicted person to the Towers in the hopes that the Masters would be destroyed and Experiment Zero ended: Mavda was the latest guardian of the Towers. Four hundred and fifty years later, the Elyrian Army recreated the Masters as living weapons: without the knowledge and help of the Vestra, the Elyrians instigated a drastic geological upheaval that created the Scar, which acted as a portal to the netherworld.&lt;ref name="QUOTEgame"/&gt;

====Endings====
Depending on the players actions and the strength of Aeron's relationship with Elena, the game has six possible endings.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;
*If the counter runs out and Elena is consumed by the curse, Aeron returns to find her transformed into a monster, and allows himself to be killed by her. Leading an army of monsters, Elena unites Elyria under her rule. This scene is a "Game Over" scenario.&lt;ref name="AndriaGameplay1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Game Over}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending D: Broken Chain''': Following the defeat of the Ninth Master, Elena attacks Aeron and then transforms, forcing him to kill her to put an end to her misery. In the epilogue, it is revealed that the Thirteen Towers' curse continued, and that Elena and Aeron were forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending D: Broken Chain}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending C: Still Together''': Returning after defeating the final two Masters, Aeron finds Elena in a monstrous form and is forced to fight her. They had then captured by the Elyrian army, who were led to them by Mavda. Mavda suggests using Elena's new powers, guided by her continued love for Aeron, to unite Impedia under Elyria's rule. The epilogue reveals that this did happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending C: Still Together}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending B: All For You''': After eating all the Master Flesh, Elena becomes Zeron's host, and Aeron fights her on top of the Thirteen Towers. Despite returning to human form, Elena says Zeron is still inside her, and to end Experiment Zero she commits suicide by throwing herself into the Scar as Mavda closes it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending B: All For You}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending A: Together Forever''': Events play out as in Ending B, but Zeron explains that the Scar was created to stop Elyria from creating biological weapons. Despite Zeron's defeat, Elena is still cursed, and decides to end Experiment Zero. Aeron chooses to join her, and the two throw themselves into the Scar, using the chain to close it as they fall. The epilogue reveals that the land continued to be plagued by war, and that the Vestra passed down Aeron and Elena's tale as a legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending A: Together Forever}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Ending S: Unbreakable Bond''': Events proceed roughly as in Ending A, except that Elena is purged of the curse. Aeron must then destroy a monstrous Zeron, saving Elena one last time. The two then leave while Mavda uses the chain to destroy the Thirteen Towers, sacrificing herself to end their evils. In the epilogue, it is revealed that the kingdoms manage to end the War of Independence after the closing of the Scar, the Vestra are granted new lands to settle on by Elyria after Elyria's king receives a letter from Mavda detailing events at the Towers, and Aeron and Elena lived happily together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Pandora's Tower|developer=[[Ganbarion]]|publisher=[[Nintendo]]|date=13 April 2012|platform=[[Wii]]|scene=Ending S: Unbreakable Bond}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The first stages of development began in late 2006 after the completion of ''[[Jump Ultimate Stars]]''. Up to that point, developer [[Ganbarion]] had only ever worked on licensed titles, and the team wanted to do something original. When Nintendo asked whether they wished to work on an original [[intellectual property]] due to being impressed by their work, Ganbarion accepted and pitched them the idea. The initial concept was how something pure had been corrupted and needed to be purified once again, with the main theme being love. The concept of the heroine needing to eat meat did not come until much later, when producer Chikako Yamakura was talking with another staff member about the then-prevalent fashion for [[ekiben]], boxed lunches served on trains, and the idea came to her "out of the blue". Only the basic elements of the story had been decided by then, and despite reservations by [[Nintendo]]'s then-CEO [[Satoru Iwata]], the project was greenlit as Iwata felt that they deserved the chance to work on a fresh project. The long development cycle was the result of continuous problems faced by the team which ran from the use of the Wii remote to mixed responses from testers on the mechanics surrounding Elena which necessitated some aspects surrounding the character to be scrapped and redone from scratch. This latter measure needed to be undertaken just a year before the game's release. Despite this, the final game came out relatively close to their initial vision.&lt;ref name="IwataInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection-205394.html|title=Iwata Asks: Pandora's Tower for Wii|publisher=[[Nintendo|Nintendo UK]]|date=23 May 2011|accessdate=15 January 2016|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ZzYOMzk8?url=https://www.nintendo.co.uk/Iwata-Asks/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/Iwata-Asks-Pandora-s-Tower-for-Wii/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection/1-The-Jump-Super-Stars-Connection-205394.html|archivedate=13 July 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's title went through multiple revisions during development, with Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami saying that he went through discussions with Yamakura about ten times and Yamakura stated that about five thousand titles had been suggested. The Japanese subtitle, "''Until I Return To Your Side''", was proposed and approved at a fairly early stage. The final title was only decided two months before the mastering process began.&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt; The Oraclos Chain was present in early concepts as a means of contrasting with Elena's feminine image, and was born as a gameplay device from discussions on how to best create an action-based experience with limited controls.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt; Alongside this, the team wanted to make the game suitable for gamers not comfortable with action games, so upgrades and equipment repair were added. The boss battles were designed to make players pull on all their available resources, creating puzzles that would leave players satisfied upon completion.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt; No original music was created for the game, with it instead using samples from western classical music that fitted the concept. While original music was considered, it was dropped as staff felt it would be "too powerful" for an overseas audience.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;

According to director Toru Haga, creating an original world and scenario after their time working on licensed properties was challenging.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/37186/pandoras-tower-interview-we-want-players-to-feel-elenas-suffering/|title=Pandora's Tower interview - we want players to feel Elena's suffering|last=East|first=Thomas|publisher=''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]''|date=10 August 2012|accessdate=15 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141103111348/http://www.officialnintendomagazine.co.uk/37186/pandoras-tower-interview-we-want-players-to-feel-elenas-suffering/|archivedate=2014-11-03|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Laws, the deities of Impedia, was based on the [[Eastern philosophy|Eastern philosophical]] concept of "[[Yin and yang|yin yang]] [[Wu Xing|wu xing]]": each "Law" was an aspect or element of the world, which balanced against each other and had two opposing counterparts representing each element. If one part vanished, the balance would be disrupted and the natural would be adversely effected, as portrayed in the game.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/04/16/interview-why-pandoras-tower-has-a-creepy-merchant-lady-and-more/|title=Interview: Why Pandora's Tower Has A Creepy Merchant Lady And More|last=Sahdev|first=Ishaan|publisher=Siliconera|date=16 April 2013|accessdate=15 January 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140912062217/http://www.siliconera.com/2013/04/16/interview-why-pandoras-tower-has-a-creepy-merchant-lady-and-more/|archivedate=12 September 2014|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts influenced the design of the Towers: the first three were designed around [[Wood (Wu Xing)|wood]], [[Earth (Wu Xing)|earth]] and [[Water (Wu Xing)|water]], then later towers representing [[Metal (Wu Xing)|metal]] and [[Fire (Wu Xing)|fire]]. Each tower was divided into "male" (yang) and "female" (yin) halves.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; This concept was applied so as to keep the Towers from being repetitive for players, using different shades and designs while retaining their shared symbolic color.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt; The law against eating meat present in the world was inspired by a social phenomenon noted by Yamakura where men and women approached each other counter to popular views on gender relationships, translated as "carnivorous girls and herbivorous boys": this concept gave birth to the scenes of Elena having trouble eating the flesh offerings.&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt;

According to Haga, the story's main theme was saving Elena from the curse and then returning to a normal life.&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt; The world design, narrative complexity and number of characters was kept to a minimum so players would have their attention directed upon the main characters' plight. When developing the characters, Haga wanted players to relate easily to Aeron, and he was developed to become not too outspoken or assertive.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt; The character Elena was present from the beginning of development, but due to the negative feedback of testers, Elena needed to undergo a major overhaul, including redesigning her monster transformation so that players would sympathize better with her condition, and all the dialogue and cutscenes involving her being redone from scratch. As a result of these developments, the character was portrayed as a strong-willed woman who did not want to be a burden on Aeron despite her condition, in addition to helping him rather than just letting him handle the entire quest.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "IwataInterview"/&gt; Mavda and her husband were designed to contrast with the relationship between Aeron and Elena: while they looked odd, they were in fact a devoted couple similar to the main protagonists. Her design originated from the initial ideas for the game's merchant, who would have a large pack on their back. She was compared by Haga to cynical witches found in traditional European fairy tales.&lt;ref name="ONMinterview"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "SilInterview"/&gt;

''Pandora's Tower'' was first announced in January 2011 during Nintendo's three-quarterly financial report, which was followed shortly by the opening of the official website.

A North American release for ''Pandora's Tower'' was unconfirmed, with Nintendo giving no comment on the matter. In response to this, and similar responses to both ''The Last Story'' and ''[[Xenoblade Chronicles]]'', a fan campaign dubbed [[Operation Rainfall]] was launched with the aim of pushing for a North American release for all three titles.&lt;ref name="KotakuRainfall"&gt;{{cite web|last=McWhertor|first=Michael|title=How Badly Do You Want The Last Story, Pandora's Tower and Xenoblade for Wii?|url=http://kotaku.com/5815447/how-badly-do-you-want-the-last-story-pandoras-tower-and-xenoblade-for-wii|publisher=[[Kotaku]]|date=27 June 2011|accessdate=27 June 2011|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6dlmOJdJv?url=http://kotaku.com/5815447/how-badly-do-you-want-the-last-story-pandoras-tower-and-xenoblade-for-wii|archivedate=14 December 2015|deadurl=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While ''Xenoblade Chronicles'' and ''The Last Story'' were chosen due to their developer pedigree, ''Pandora's Tower'' was chosen due to its unique mechanics and the fact it was also published by Nintendo, in addition to its positive Japanese reception and the fact that it had a planned English release in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2028905/operation-rainfall-how-a-fan-campaign-brought-nintendo-to-its-knees.html|title=Operation Rainfall: How a fan campaign brought Nintendo to its knees|last=Gagne|first=Ken|publisher=''[[PC World]]''|date=4 March 2013|accessdate=29 November 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161128203949/http://www.pcworld.com/article/2028905/operation-rainfall-how-a-fan-campaign-brought-nintendo-to-its-knees.html|archivedate=28 November 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Operation Rainfall focused their attention fully on ''Pandora's Tower'', their campaign included both their standard messaging to Nintendo, and the decision to pitch the game to third-party publishers themselves: the companies they chose to pitch to included [[Atlus USA|Atlus]], [[Marvelous USA|Xseed Games]], [[Aksys Games]] and [[Nippon Ichi Software|NIS America]].

On aggregate site [[Metacritic]], ''Pandora's Tower'' received a score of 73/100 based on 48 critic reviews, denoting "mixed or average" reception.&lt;ref name="PTmeta"/&gt; [[Destructoid]]'s Tony Ponce praised the game's premise and how fleshed out Elena was despite her role as a damsel in distress, but felt that there was too much background lore, and that Aeron's lack of personality hurt the relationship aspect.&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; Andrew Fitch, writing for ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'', praised the world design, but faulted the lack of character development given to Aeron and Elena.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; [[Eurogamer]]'s Matt Edwards referred to the game's plot as "a soppy and yet surprisingly sinister love story", saying that moments between the couple raised a genuine smile.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; [[IGN]]'s Chris Schilling said that while the story was "slight", it was bolstered by a good localization and voice acting, in addition to darker elements in the plot and during cutscenes.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; [[GameSpot]]'s Ashton Raze praised Aeron and Elena's romance as "a grounded, human [story] in a world of monsters".&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Heidi Kemps, writing for [[Joystiq]], noted genuine emotion in the relationship mechanics of Aeron and Elema,&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt; while Steve Hogarty of ''[[Official Nintendo Magazine]]'' referred to the scenario as "a boy-meets-girl love story with a [[Clive Barker]] twist" in addition to praising its dark tone.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt; The game's time limit mechanic and its impact on Elena's condition divided opinion: some praised its implementation,&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; but some critics noted that it might put too much pressure on the player.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;

Japanese magazine ''[[Famitsu]]'' praised the gameplay for being both fun and accessible for those not used to action games, with further praise going to the control scheme.&lt;ref name="FamiReview"/&gt; ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'', reviewing the Japanese version, praised the combat's versatility despite some faults, but found the puzzle elements tedious and criticized the camera.&lt;ref name="CVGreview"/&gt; The gameplay was generally praised by Ponce despite some repeating puzzles and enjoyed both the extensive post-game content and level of challenge.&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; In contrast, Fitch found combat repetitive, criticized the fact that enemies respawned after leaving each area, and found elements from the dungeon design to the relationship mechanics poorly implemented when compared to other similar Japanese titles. Despite this, he did enjoy the variety of dungeon designs and the mechanics employed in boss battles.&lt;ref name="EGMreview"/&gt; Edwards praised the overall gameplay mechanics, particularly noting the chain's gameplay options and the game's difficulty curve, although he noted that the normal melee combat lacked sophistication when compared to other titles available at the time.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Schilling felt that the Oraclos Chain mechanics helped keep the combat interesting in addition to challenging boss battles, but found standard combat repetitive.&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; Raze echoed many of these sentiments, but found that repetitive enemy design and an awkward camera hampered the experience.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Kemps found normal weapon combat boring when compared to the Chain, and felt that each available control scheme had advantages and drawbacks related to them.&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt; Hogarty enjoyed the boss battles, but found overall combat repetitive and faulted both the controls and the fixed camera.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;

The music was praised by ''Famitsu'', but one reviewer that it would be "nice if the graphics were better".&lt;ref name="FamiReview"/&gt; ''Computer and Video Games'' praised the voice acting and music, but noted frequent drops in framerate.&lt;ref name="CVGreview"/&gt; Ponce panned the English voice work, saying that it added to the unlikeliness of Aeron and Elena's relationship in addition to poor lip-syncing, and called the textures "very ugly" despite a large color spectrum.&lt;ref name="DesReview"/&gt; Edwards also noted the variety of colors and dungeon design found in the Towers, but noted that the game's pace left little time to admire them.&lt;ref name="EuroReview"/&gt; Schilling felt that the art design was hampered by technical limitations and praised the choral musical elements,&lt;ref name="IGNreview"/&gt; while Raze praised both the character designs and soundtrack.&lt;ref name="GSreview"/&gt; Kemps called the character and environment design "superb" despite technical limitations,&lt;ref name="JoyReview"/&gt; and Hogarty praised the boss monsters' designs and scenic variety.&lt;ref name="ONMreview"/&gt;

'''Paul Laffoley''' (August 14, 1935 – November 16, 2015) was an American [[visionary artist]] and [[architect]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]], represented by [[Kent Fine Art]] in New York.

==Biography==

Paul Laffoley, as one of America's foremost visionary artists, seemed to work in a perpetual present tense (there is no "late" or "old age" style for him). From a young age, spiritual productivity was measured by how deeply one's wisdom could be developed, and how broadly one's compassion could exert itself.

Paul Laffoley was born on August 14, 1935 in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], to an [[Irish Catholic]] family.  His father, Paul Laffoley, Sr., the president of the Cambridge Trust Company, was also a [[lawyer]] and taught classes at [[Harvard Business School]]. Although his father had been against him pursuing painting as a career, Laffoley was indoctrinated with his father's religious philosophical beliefs including aspects of Buddhism and Hinduism and what he called "mind-physics". Laffoley senior also instructed Paul that there was "no gravity" which was a source of great humor when Paul was given the assignment to explain in grade school.

Laffoley wrote that his first spoken word was "[[Constantinople]]" at the age of six months. He did not speak again until he was four years old.&lt;ref name="madone"/&gt; He was diagnosed as having Asperger's Syndrome testing both high and low academically.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} According to Laffoley, he attended the progressive Mary Lee Burbank School in [[Belmont, Massachusetts]], where his draftsman's talent was ridiculed by his [[abstract expressionist]] teachers.  After further studies at the Waldorf School, Laffoley would complete undergraduate studies at [[Brown University]], graduating in 1961 with honors in classics, philosophy, and [[art history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Paul Laffoley Bio|url=http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley|publisher=Kent Fine Arts LLC|accessdate=12 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021031335/http://kentfineart.net/artists/paul-laffoley/|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As written by Paul in The Phenomenology of Revelation, he was given eight [[electroshock]] treatments after the termination of "about a year of weekly sessions with a psychiatrist, who had treated me for a mild state of catatonia" while at Brown in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lafolley|first=Paul|title="The Dream As The Initiation" from The Phenomenology of Revelation|year=1989|publisher=Kent Fine Arts|location=New York, NY|isbn=1878607057|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1961, he enrolled at the [[Harvard Graduate School of Design]], where he studied architecture because it consisted of diagrams that rendered objects in space with accuracy and precision.  He also studied with the sculptor Mirko Basaldella at Harvard's Carpenter Center that he cited was an early influence. After one year, he was summarily grand juried out of the GSD by the faculty for being "overly involved in his work". By chance, Laffoley was given an issue of Progressive Architecture by his uncle with Frederick Kiesler on the cover.  Laffoley felt Kiesler work was what he had been searching for, and after writing 17 letters, Laffoley came to New York and succeeded in apprenticing with [[Frederick John Kiesler|Frederick Kiesler]].  While canvasing the art scene in New York, Laffoley would meet [[Andy Warhol]], who offered him a place to sleep at his 87th Street fire station if he would report on late night television between 1 and 5 am. It was from watching these Indian Head Test Patterns along with his early exposure to a Hindu tutor that Laffoley would arrive at a format for his large scale paintings that would dominate his work for five decades.

After the death of his father in 1963, Paul would return to Boston from New York, and eventually established his first dedicated studio space at 36 Bromfield Street on Christmas Day, 1968.  It was there that Paul's career would begin to "connect" with an early show at the Orson Welles Theater that was "highjacked" and taken to the Woodstock Music Festival for presentation by Dean Gitter without Paul's permission.  In an effort to recover his work, Paul took the bus to Woodstock which lead to his exposure to the current countercultures of the day, and would be followed by numerous exhibition opportunities and curatorial projects that would lead to the creation of his Boston Visionary Cell (1971).  The Boston Visionary Cell, which Paul Laffoley founded on the model of an artists’ guild, was a highly communal and curatorial undertaking.  The charter of the Boston Visionary Cell underscores Laffoley’s thought processes “to develop and advance visionary art”.

By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, and evolved to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging [[psychotronics|psychotronic]] device, perhaps similar to architectural monuments such as [[Stonehenge]] or the Cathedral of Notre Dame and their spiritual aura.  Works such as Thanaton III (1989), The Orgone Motor (1983), and the Geochronmechane: The Time Machine from Earth (1990) would follow this concept.

After the destruction of the World Trade Center towers on [[September 11, 2001]], Laffoley was one of a number of architects who, in 2002, submitted designs for the competition to plan the [[One World Trade Center|Freedom Tower]]. Laffoley took his inspiration from the work of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] architect [[Antoni Gaudí]]. His conception was to plan a gigantic hotel in the style of Gaudí's [[Sagrada Família]] church in [[Barcelona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Glenn|title=Postmodern, In a Manner Of Speaking; A Shape Out of 1908 Is Offered Downtown|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/21/nyregion/postmodern-in-a-manner-of-speaking-a-shape-out-of-1908-is-offered-downtown.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=January 21, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="madone"&gt;{{cite web|last=Larroque|first=Jean-Pierre|title=The Mad One|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmBuzdLUFsc|publisher=Doublethink Productions|accessdate=13 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Austin Museum of Art organized a traveling survey of his career in 1999, Mr. Laffoley became something of a cult figure for curators around the world. The Palais de Tokyo in Paris devoted an entire room to his work in its 2009 exhibition "Chasing Napoleon", and several of his works were included in "The Alternative Guide to the Universe" at the Hayward Gallery in London in 2013. Other major shows include Premonitions of the Bauharoque at the Henry Art Gallery, Seattle (publication), Secret Garden at the Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin (publication) and the recent monograph entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited by Douglas Walla and published by the University of Chicago Press in Spring 2016.

==About==
Following his formal education in the classics at Brown and architectural studies at [[Harvard]], Laffoley would begin to assimilate and systematically cross-pollinate his related strands of intellectual inquiry.  In a search for expanded opportunities, he went to New York in 1963 to work with the visionary artist and architect [[Frederick Kiesler]], and was also recruited to view late-night TV for [[Andy Warhol]] in exchange for a place to sleep.  Weekdays, Laffoley found employment with [[Emery Roth &amp; Sons]] where he worked on the plans for the yet to be built [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] Towers before being terminated upon his suggestion of bridges joining the two buildings.

At that time, Laffoley had been painting in the basement of his family home in [[Belmont, Massachusetts|Belmont]] on the weekends, completing his first fully mature vision:  The [[Kali-Yuga]]: The End of the Universe at 424826 A.D.  From this point forward, Laffoley began to formulate his unique trans-disciplinary approach to a new discipline combining, [[philosophy]], [[science]], [[architecture]] and spirituality to the practice of painting.  Laffoley first began to organize his ideas in a format related to eastern [[mandalas]], partially inspired by the late night patterns he watched for Warhol on late night television.  This quickly developed into four general subcategories of paintings: [[operating system]]s, [[Psychotronics|psychotronic]] devices, meta-energy, [[time travel]], and [[lucid dream]]ing.  Conceived of as "structured singularities", Laffoley never works in series, but rather approaches each project as a unique schematic.  Working in a solitary lifestyle, each 73 ½ x 73 ½ inch canvas would take up to three years to paint and code.  By the late 1980s, Laffoley began to move from the spiritual and the intellectual, to the view of his work as an interactive, physically engaging psychotronic device, a modern approach to trans-disciplinary enlightenment and its spiritual aura.

From an early age, Laffoley manifested an obsessive interest in [[UFO]]s.  He had seen the movie ''[[The Day the Earth Stood Still]]'' 873 times.  He explains that his obsessive interest in the film derives partly from a fascination with the architecture of the space ship in the film which, early on in his life, was subconscious. While he was still a child he made a vow to become an architect so that he could design flying saucers, although he did not become a registered architect until he was 50 years of age.

{{quote|Two years later, in preparation for a major oral surgery, I was subjected to a routine cat-scan of my head.  As a result, a miniature metallic-like "implant" was discovered in my brain near the pineal gland.  A local chapter of [[MUFON]] (Mutual UFO Network) declared it to be a "nanotechnological laboratory" capable of accelerating or retarding my brain activity.  I have come to believe that the implant is extraterrestrial in origin and is the main motivation of my ideas and theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laffoley|first=Paul|title="Disco Volante" from the UFO Show|year=2000|publisher=University Galleries, Illinois State University|location=Normal, IL|isbn=0-945558-30-9|pages=34, 36, 24–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Work==

Painted on large canvases, the majority of Paul Laffoley's paintings combine words and imagery to depict a spiritual architecture of explanation, tackling concepts like dimensionality, time travel through hacking relativity, connecting conceptual threads shared by philosophers through the millennia, and theories about the cosmic origins of mankind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Outsider Art Sourcebook|date=March 2009|publisher=Raw Vision|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-0954339326}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=The Boston Visionary Cell|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/design/paul-laffoley-the-boston-visionary-cell.html?_r=0|accessdate=12 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=17 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=Ken|title=ART IN REVIEW: Paul Laffoley, 'Portaling'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/04/06/arts/art-in-review-paul-laffoley-portaling.html|accessdate=13 October 2013|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 6, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010,

Laffoley's writings as well as works of art were published in May 2016 by the [[University of Chicago Press]] in a new book entitled ''The Essential Paul Laffoley'' edited and texts by Douglas Walla, with further texts by [[Linda Dalywimple Henderson]], [[Arielle Saiber]] and [[Steven Moskowitz]].

British writer [[Michael Bracewell]], in his collection of essays entitled ''When Surface was Depth'' observed: "If Laffoley's work within the Boston Visionary Cell can be said to have one principal preoccupation - a common denominator of his eclectic scholarship and practice - then that preoccupation would be to understand the process by which one goes from becoming to being." Bracewell has also written that, "The Boston Visionary Cell, as a concretized manifestation of its inhabitant's work and preoccupations, describes the way in which a chaos of data - no less than a chaos of marble - can be sculpted by research to release the perfect forms within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracewell|first=Michael|title=when surface was depth|date=July 9, 2002|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=London|isbn=0306811308|pages=346–353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4652">'''Penguin Composition Rules''' were the guidelines written by typographer [[Jan Tschichold]] for use in composing the pages and typography of [[Penguin Books]]. The rules were embodied in a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. The booklet includes headings for various aspects of composition: Text Composition; Indenting of Paragraphs; Punctuation Marks and Spelling; Capitals, Small Capitals, and Italics; References and Footnotes; Folios; The Printing of Plays; The Printing of Poetry; Make-up.

Beyond this specific set of guidelines, Tschichold made further changes to Penguin's graphic standards. Penguin is well known for its standardized book covers and formats, as well as the diversity of the standards.&lt;ref&gt;The seeming contradiction between standardization and diversity is explained by the vast numbers of books produced by Penguin over many years.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jan Tschichold and Penguin==
Penguin Books was founded by Allen Lane in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105152710/http://www.penguin.co.uk/static/cs/uk/0/aboutus/history.html |archivedate=2013-11-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The basic look of Penguin was established before Lane brought Tschichold to Penguin in the late 1940s as head of typography and production. Tschichold was in England at Penguin between 1947 and 1949 before returning to Switzerland.

Tschichold's standardization of Penguin covers essentially took existing elements and refined them visually and refined their arrangement. Under Tschichold the covers included the use of [[Eric Gill|Eric Gill's]] [[Gill Sans]] typeface, which he was careful to have spaced evenly. According to Tschichold establishing this quality was not immediately embraced by the compositors; “Every day I had to wade through miles of corrections (often ten books daily). I had a rubber stamp made: ‘Equalize letter-spaces according to their visual value.’ It was totally ignored; the hand compositors continued to space out the capitals on title-pages (where optical spacing is essential) with spaces of equal thickness.”&lt;ref name="doubleday"&gt;Richard Doubleday, "[http://www.dis.uia.mx/conference/2005/HTMs-PDFs/PenguinBooks.pdf Jan Tschichold at Penguin Books: A Resurgance [sic&amp;#93; of Classical Book Design]" (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Gill Sans, Tschichold made use of Monotype [[Bembo]], Monotype [[Centaur (typeface)|Centaur]] (by [[Bruce Rogers (typographer)|Bruce Rogers]]) and Gill's [[Perpetua (typeface)|Perpetua]] typeface.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

The covers conformed to the golden ratio (4⅜" × 7⅛", 111mm × 181mm). For Penguin's distinctive orange color, Tschichold replaced it with a warmer tone.&lt;ref name="doubleday" /&gt;

[[File:Piss Christ by Serrano Andres (1987).jpg|thumb|''Piss Christ'']]

'''''Immersion (Piss Christ)''''' is a 1987 photograph by the American [[artist]] and [[photographer]] [[Andres Serrano]]. It depicts a small plastic [[crucifix]] submerged in a small glass tank of the artist's [[urine]]. The piece was a winner of the [[Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art]]'s "Awards in the Visual Arts" competition,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=NEA's Cloudy Future |last=Johnson |first=Jennifer |work=Albion Monitor |url=http://monitor.net/monitor//9804a/nea.html |date=April 9, 1998 |accessdate=October 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Blgd1hU0?url=http://monitor.net/monitor//9804a/nea.html |archivedate=October 29, 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was sponsored in part by the [[National Endowment for the Arts]], a [[United States Government]] agency that offers support and funding for artistic projects.

The work generated a large amount of controversy based on assertions that it was [[blasphemy|blasphemous]]. Serrano himself said of the controversy: "I had no idea ''Piss Christ'' would get the attention it did, since I meant neither blasphemy nor offense by it. I've been a Catholic all my life, so I am a follower of Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://creators.vice.com/en_us/article/9ag9jz/trump-torture-and-a-killer-clown-inside-provocateur-andres-serranos-latest-exhibition|title=The Creator of "Piss Christ" Photographs Trump, Torture, and a Killer Clown|first=Andrew|last=Nunes|publisher=Vice.com|date=February 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The photograph is of a small plastic crucifix submerged in what appears to be a yellow liquid. The artist has described the substance as being his own urine in a glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9viccUYUSVYC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;dq=serrano+piss+christ+yellow+liquid#v=onepage&amp;q=serrano%20piss%20christ%20yellow%20liquid&amp;f=false|title=Understanding Society, Culture, and Television |first=Paul |last=Monaco |page=100 |year=2000 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=0-275-97095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Qt8uVTV_RQkC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=serrano+piss+christ+yellow+liquid#v=onepage&amp;q=yellow%20liquid&amp;f=false|title=Art in the social order: the making of the modern conception of art|first=Preben|last=Mortensen|page=13|year=1997|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=0-7914-3277-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph was one of a series of photographs that Serrano had made that involved classical statuettes submerged in various fluids—milk, blood, and urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=0OFND9MYCowC&amp;pg=PA400&amp;dq=serrano+piss+christ+yellow+liquid#v=onepage&amp;q=yellow&amp;f=false|title=Perspectives on American religion and culture|first=Peter W.|last=Williams|page=400|year=1999|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=1-57718-117-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It followed two years after Serrano's 1985 work, ''[[Blood Cross]]''.

It is glossy and its colors are deeply saturated. The presentation is that of a golden, rosy medium including a constellation of tiny bubbles. Without Serrano specifying the substance to be urine and without the title referring to urine by another name, the viewer would not necessarily be able to differentiate between the stated medium of urine and a medium of similar appearance, such as [[amber]] or [[polyurethane]].&lt;ref name=Kester&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&amp;id=1124 |title=Art, activism, and oppositionality: essays from Afterimage |first=Grant H. |last=Kester |page=126 |year=1998 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0-8223-2095-9 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130102234436/http://metapsychology.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_doc.php?type=book&amp;id=1124 |archivedate=January 2, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serrano has not ascribed overtly political content to ''Piss Christ'' and related artworks, on the contrary stressing their ambiguity. He has also said that while this work is not intended to denounce religion, it alludes to a perceived commercializing or cheapening of Christian icons in contemporary culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-eu5cm9iuewC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=Lucy+Lippard+Andres+Serrano+Piss+Christ#v=onepage&amp;q=Lucy%20Lippard%20Andres%20Serrano%20Piss%20Christ&amp;f=false|title=Review—But Is It Art?|last=Seeley|first=Bill|work=Metapsychology online reviews|year=2002|accessdate=September 2, 2010|isbn=978-0-8223-2095-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he has explicitly rejected the assertion that he was motivated by blasphemy, saying instead that it was intended as a serious work of Christian art. He said, "What it symbolizes is the way Christ died: the blood came out of him but so did the piss and the shit. Maybe if Piss Christ upsets you, it's because it gives some sense of what the crucifixion actually was like... I was born and raised a Catholic and I've been a Christian all my life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2016/apr/03/andres-serrano-interview-donald-trump-piss-christ|title=Andres Serrano on Donald Trump: I never speak ill of people who've posed for me|first=Jonathan|last=Jones|date=April 3, 2016|newspaper=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art critic [[Lucy R. Lippard]] has presented a constructive case for the [[Formalism (art)|formal value]] of Serrano's ''Piss Christ'', which she characterizes as mysterious and beautiful.&lt;ref name=Kester/&gt; She writes that the work is "a darkly beautiful photographic image… the small wood and plastic crucifix becomes virtually monumental as it floats, photographically enlarged, in a deep rosy glow that is both ominous and glorious."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lippard|first=Lucy R.|date=April 1990|title=The Spirit and the Letter|url=|journal=Art in America|volume=80|pages=238–245|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lippard suggests that the formal values of the image can be regarded separately from other meanings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=AOPQy-PwQ2oC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=serrano+piss+christ#v=onepage&amp;q=serrano%20piss%20christ&amp;f=false|title=An introduction to the philosophy of art|first=Richard Thomas|last=Eldridge|page=211|year=2003|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-80135-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
In 1987, Serrano's ''Piss Christ'' was exhibited at the [[Stux Gallery]] in New York and was favorably received.&lt;ref name="Young2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fellow and Lecturer in Law Alison Young|title=Judging the Image: Art, Value, Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AnqHd7nAz-wC&amp;pg=PA144|date=January 11, 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-41668-4|pages=144–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The piece later caused a scandal when it was exhibited in 1989, with detractors, including [[United States Senate|United States Senators]] [[Al D'Amato]] and [[Jesse Helms]], outraged that Serrano received $15,000 for the work, and $5,000 in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arts.gov/sites/default/files/NEA-Annual-Report-1986.pdf |title=NEA Annual Report 1986 |publisher=www.nea.gov|page= 170}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the taxpayer-funded [[National Endowment for the Arts]].

Sister [[Wendy Beckett]], an art critic and [[Catholic nun]], stated in a television interview with [[Bill Moyers]] that she regarded the work as not blasphemous but a statement on "this is what we are doing to Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=A consecrated critic—profile of popular television art critic Sister Wendy Beckett |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n7_v86/ai_21113230/pg_2 | journal=[[Art in America]] | accessdate=September 5, 2007 |first=Eleanor |last=Heartney |date=July 1998 |archiveurl = http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628133347/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1248/is_n7_v86/ai_21113230/pg_2 |archivedate = June 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a retrospective of Serrano's work at the [[National Gallery of Victoria]] (NGV) in 1997, the then [[Archdiocese of Melbourne|Catholic Archbishop of Melbourne]], [[George Pell]], sought an injunction from the [[Supreme Court of Victoria]] to restrain the National Gallery of Victoria from publicly displaying ''Piss Christ'', which was not granted. Some days later, one patron attempted to remove the work from the gallery wall, and two teenagers later attacked it with a hammer.&lt;ref name="LawText" /&gt; Gallery officials reported receiving death threats in response to ''Piss Christ''.&lt;ref name="LivingWater"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.martinrothonline.com/lw10.htm |work=Living Water to Light the Journey | title=Chapter 10: When Blasphemy Came to Town|last=Roth |first=Martin |year=1999 |publisher=MartinRothOnline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the NGV cancelled the show, allegedly out of concern for a [[Rembrandt]] exhibition that was also on display at the time.&lt;ref name="LawText"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Casey |first=Damien |date=June 2000 |title=Sacrifice, Piss Christ, and liberal excess. |journal=Law Text Culture |url=http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/staffhome/dacasey/Serrano.html |format=Reprint |accessdate=October 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609135113/http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/staffhome/dacasey/Serrano.html |archivedate=June 9, 2010  }}&lt;!-- alternate URL: http://dlibrary.acu.edu.au/staffhome/dacasey/Serrano.htm --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters argued that the controversy over ''Piss Christ'' is an issue of [[artistic freedom]] and [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref name="LivingWater"/&gt;

''Piss Christ'' was included in "Down by Law", a "show within a show" on identity politics and disobedience that formed part of the 2006 [[Whitney Biennial]]. The British [[Channel 4]] TV documentary ''Damned in the USA'' explored the controversy surrounding ''Piss Christ''.

On April 17, 2011, a print of ''Piss Christ'' was vandalized "beyond repair" by Christian protesters while on display during the ''Je crois aux miracles'' (I believe in miracles) exhibition at the [[Yvon Lambert Gallery|Collection Lambert]], a contemporary art museum in [[Avignon]], France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sage|first=Alexandria|title=Vandalism and threats greet "Piss Christ" in France|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/18/us-france-art-idUSTRE73H4JR20110418|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=April 18, 2011|date=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LeMonde&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2011/04/17/une-photographie-d-art-polemique-detruite-a-avignon_1509023_3246.html|title=Une photographie d'art controversée détruite à Avignon|publisher=lemonde.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serrano's photo ''The Church'' was similarly vandalized in the attack.

'''''Pollice Verso''''' (from {{lang-la|with a turned thumb}}) is a painting by French artist [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]], featuring the [[Pollice verso|eponymous Roman gesture]] directed to the winning [[gladiator]]s.

The gesture on the painting is given by the [[Vestals]] to the victorious [[murmillo]], awaiting the decision on the beaten [[retiarius]] at the [[Colosseum]]. The painting inspired the 2000 film ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'', where [[Commodus]] holds out a raised thumb to spare [[Maximus Decimus Meridius|Maximus]].{{Citation needed|reason=The reference below is now dead and was not from reliable source;|date=November 2018}}

==The painting==
Apart from the gladiators and Vestals, the picture shows the [[Roman emperor|emperor]] in his box. Gérôme deliberately used the light and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] to depict some features.  The blend of [[voyeurism]] and a sense of moral superiority is a specific 19th-century feature.&lt;ref name="KEJ"&gt;Eckart Köhne, Cornelia Ewigleben, Ralph Jackson. ''Gladiators and Caesars: the power of spectacle in ancient Rome'', University of California Press, 2000, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
[[Alexander Turney Stewart]] purchased the painting from Gérôme and exhibited it in [[New York City]]. He published a [[pamphlet]] about the work, proving to the satisfaction of his contemporaries that ''pollice verso'' was a matter of turning the thumb up or down.&lt;ref name="WCG"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allartclassic.com/pictures_zoom.php?p_number=52&amp;p=&amp;number=GEJ001|title= Gerome Art Reproductions- Pollice Verso |publisher = World Classic Gallery|author= |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical accuracy===
Gérôme's depiction of Colosseum's architecture is based on accurate drawings and the armour of gladiators follows the design of those found in [[Pompeii]].&lt;ref name="KEJ"/&gt; Gérôme also checked the written sources for archaeological reference. Some Latin textbooks used ''Pollice Verso'' to illustrate Roman customs.&lt;ref name="WCG"/&gt; 

===Influence===
The producers of ''Gladiator'' showed [[Ridley Scott]] a reproduction of ''Pollice Verso'' before he read the film script. "That image spoke to me of the Roman Empire in all its glory and wickedness. I knew right then and there I was hooked", said Scott.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kingsgalleries.com/pollice-verso-thumbs-down/|title= Pollice Verso – Thumbs Down|publisher = Kings Galleries|author= |accessdate=2010-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it was found that the secutor's armour is not properly assembled.&lt;ref name="KEJ"/&gt;

'''''Searching for Whitopia: An Improbable Journey to the Heart of White America''''' is a 2009 non-fiction book by [[Rich Benjamin]].&lt;ref name=NPR&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=113543979|date=6 October 2009|accessdate=10 April 2012|publisher=[[NPR]]|title=A Black Author's Journey Into American 'Whitopia'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1929729,00.html|title=America's Booming White Enclaves|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=James, Randy|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Benjamin briefly summarized his experiences in a [[TED (conference)|TED talk]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

==Overview==
African American journalist [[Rich Benjamin]] documents his journeys to find out why more and more white Americans move to small towns and areas that are, for the most part, white, and to explain why Whitopias are growing and what it means for the United States.

Benjamin mounted a two-year tour of the United States, covering 26,907 miles (43,303 km), looking for "Whitopias", which he defined as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WVSZAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Searching For Whitopia|website=[[Google Books]]|pages=2|author=Benjamin, Rich|publisher=[[Hachette Books]]|date=2009|authorlink=Rich Benjamin}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*an area which has experienced at least 6% growth rate since 2000;
*the great majority of that growth consists of white persons;
*the area has a pleasant look, feel, ambiance, or charm.

He spent several months in three such areas: [[St. George, Utah]], [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], and [[Forsyth County, Georgia]]. In each case, he generated a master plan to thoroughly immerse himself in the community's core, with lists of the power brokers, the important groups, and the significant events. He tried to volunteer or involve himself with those people and groups.

==Author's experiences==
In St. George, Benjamin rented a house over the [[telephone]] in a gated community, La Entrada.&lt;ref name=T&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.tiny.ted.com/talks/rich_benjamin_my_road_trip_through_the_whitest_towns_in_america|publisher=[[TED (conference)|TED]]|title=Rich Benjamin: My road trip through the whitest towns in America|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He took up golfing, fishing, and [[Texas Hold 'Em]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He was generally welcomed in every instance, and learned that the dominant topic in St. George was [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]]; a local group had been organized to fight immigration, and they held regular rallies.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

In Idaho, Benjamin rented a resort cabin at [[Lake Coeur d'Alene]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He found a significant number of retired [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers living there,&lt;ref name=T/&gt; and also found a significant number of gun owners where he learned to shoot a pistol at the local gun range.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

He spent time at a retreat, the only non-white journalist in the group, at the Council of [[Aryan Nations]] compound.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He was told that the group is not "white-supremacy"; they are "white-segregation" - they merely don't want to live in close proximity to non-white people.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He noted the preponderance of [[Flags of the Confederate States of America|Confederate flags]].&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

In Georgia he found the predominant cultural activity revolved around a mega-church, so he involved himself in its activities.&lt;ref name=T/&gt; He felt the most comfortable in this situation, since both blacks and whites in this area are used to seeing the other - as contrasted to the first two sites, where a black person is still a rarity.&lt;ref name=T/&gt;

'''Shadow play''', also known as '''shadow puppetry''', is an ancient form of [[storytelling]] and [[entertainment]] which uses flat articulated cut-out figures (shadow puppets) which are held between a source of light and a translucent screen or [[scrim (material)|scrim]]. The cut-out shapes of the puppets sometimes include translucent color or other types of detailing. Various effects can be achieved by moving both the puppets and the light source. A talented [[puppeteer]] can make the figures appear to walk, dance, fight, nod and laugh.

Shadow play is popular in various cultures, among both children and adults in many countries around the world. More than 20 countries are known to have shadow show troupes. Shadow play is an old tradition and it has a long history in Southeast Asia, especially in [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Thailand]] and [[Cambodia]]. It has been an ancient art and a living folk tradition in [[China]], [[India]] and [[Nepal]]. It is also known in [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Greece]], [[Germany]], [[France]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=orr69/&gt;&lt;ref name=bosnes302&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=Acting: An International Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTkCI62oXjEC&amp;pg=PA335 |year=2001| publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-0-87436-795-9|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=The Shadow Puppet Theatre of Malaysia: A Study of Wayang Kulit with Performance Scripts and Puppet Designs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ykQlV616gX4C |year=2010|publisher=McFarland|isbn=978-0-7864-5792-2|pages=61–63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Shadow play probably developed from "par" shows with narrative scenes painted on a large cloth and the story further related through song. As the shows were mostly performed at night the par was illuminated with an oil lamp. Shadow puppet theatre likely originated in Central Asia-China or in India in the 1st millennium BCE.&lt;ref name=chen25&gt;Fan Pen Chen (2003), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1179080 Shadow Theaters of the World], Asian Folklore Studies, Vol. 62, No. 1 (2003), pp. 25-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=orr69&gt;{{cite journal | last=Orr | first=Inge C. | title=Puppet Theatre in Asia | journal=Asian Folklore Studies | publisher=Nanzan University | volume=33 | issue=1 | year=1974 | doi=10.2307/1177504 | pages=69–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; By at least around 200 BCE the figures on cloth seem to have been replaced with puppetry in Indian "tholu bomalatta" shows. These are performed behind a thin screen with flat, jointed puppets made of colorfully painted transparent leather. The puppets are held close to the screen and lit from behind, while hands and arms are manipulated with attached canes and lower legs swinging freely from the knee.

The evidence of shadow puppet theatre is found in both ancient Chinese and Indian texts. The most significant historical centers of shadow play theatre have been China, Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref name=orr69/&gt;&lt;ref name=bosnes302/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC |year=1996| publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|pages=434, 526–531, 906, 1114–1115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Martin Banham, there is little mention of indigenous theatrical activity in the Middle East between the 3rd century CE and the 13th-century, including the centuries that followed the Islamic conquest of the region.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p241"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC&amp;pg=PA241|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|pages=241–242}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shadow puppet play, states Banham, probably came into vogue in the Middle East after the Mongol invasions and thereafter it incorporated local innovations by the 16th-century. Little mention of shadow play is found in Islamic literature of Iran, but much is found in Turkish and 19th-century Ottoman Empire influenced territories.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p241"/&gt;

While shadow play theatre is an Asian invention, hand puppets have a long history in Europe.&lt;ref name="Banham1996p887"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin Banham|title=The Cambridge Paperback Guide to Theatre |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ubr35UeE-UQC |year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-44654-9|pages=887–888}}&lt;/ref&gt; As European merchant ships sailed in the search of sea routes to India and China, they helped diffuse popular entertainment arts and cultural practices into Europe.

===Prelude to cinematography===
According to Stephen Herbert, the popular shadow theatre evolved nonlinearly into projected slides and ultimately into [[cinematography]]. The common principle in these innovations were the creative use of light, images and a projection screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Herbert|title=A History of Pre-cinema|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pwg_dav1IpcC|year=2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-21148-2|pages=iv–ix, Introduction chapter}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Olive Cook, there are many parallels in the development of shadow play and modern cinema, such as their use of music, voice, attempts to introduce colors and mass popularity.&lt;ref&gt;Olive Cook (1963), [https://archive.org/details/movementintwodim00cook Movement in Two Dimensions], Hutchinson, pages 47-58&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tholu Pava Koothu'' performance of Kerala uses leather puppets whose images are projected on backlit screen. The shadows are used to creatively express characters and stories in the ''[[Ramayana]]''. A complete performance of the epic can take forty one nights, while an abridged performance lasts as few as seven days.&lt;ref name="Osnes2001p335"&gt;{{cite book|author=Beth Osnes|title=Acting: An International Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WTkCI62oXjEC&amp;pg=PA335 |year=2001| publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn= 978-0-87436-795-9|pages=335–336}}&lt;/ref&gt; One feature of the ''Tholu Pava Koothu'' show is that it is a team performance of puppeteers, while other shadow plays such as ''Wayang'' of Indonesia is performed by a single puppeteer for the same ''Ramayana'' story.&lt;ref name="Osnes2001p335"/&gt; There are regional differences within India in the puppet arts. For example, women play a major role in shadow play theatre in most parts of India, except in Kerala and Maharashtra.&lt;ref name="ClausDiamond2003p544"/&gt; Almost everywhere, except Odisha, the puppets are made from tanned deer skin, painted and articulated. Translucent leather puppets are typical in Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, while opaque are typical in Kerala and Odisha.

''[[Wayang kulit]]'', a style of Wayang shadow play, is particularly popular in [[Java]] and [[Bali]]. The term derived from the word ''wayang'' literally means ''shadow'' or imagination in [[Javanese language|Javanese]], also connotes "spirit". The word ''kulit'' means skin, as the material from which the puppet is made is thin perforated leather sheets made from buffalo skin.

The performances of shadow puppet theater in Bali is typically at night, lasting until dawn.&lt;ref name=britwayang/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rubin2001p184"/&gt; The complete ''wayang kulit'' troupes include ''dalang'' (puppet master), ''nayaga'' ([[gamelan]] players), and ''sinden'' (female choral singer). Some of the ''nayaga'' also performed as male choral singer. The ''dalang'' (puppet master) play/ed the wayang behind the cotton screen illuminated by oil lamp or modern halogen lamp, creating visual effects similar to animation. The flat puppet has moveable joints that are animated by hand, using rods connected to the puppet. The handle of the rod is made of carved buffalo horn. On November 7, 2003, [[UNESCO]] designated ''wayang kulit'' from Indonesia as one of the ''[[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]]''.&lt;ref name=UNESCO&gt;{{cite web|title="Wayang puppet theatre", Inscribed in 2008 (3.COM) on the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity (originally proclaimed in 2003) |url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/index.php?lg=en&amp;pg=00011&amp;RL=00063 |publisher= UNESCO |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre in [[Thailand]] is called ''[[Nang yai]]''; in the south there is a tradition called ''[[Nang Talung]]''. Nang Yai puppets are normally made of [[cowhide]] and [[rattan]]. Performances are normally accompanied by a combination of [[song]]s and [[chant]]s. Performances in Thailand were temporarily suspended in 1960 due to a fire at the national theatre.

In [[Malaysia]], shadow puppet plays are also known as ''[[wayang kulit]]''. In both [[Javanese language|Javanese]] and [[Malay language|Malay]], ''Wayang'' means shadow or imagination, while ''Kulit'' means skin and refers to the leather that puppets are made from. Stories presented are usually [[mythology|mythical]] and morality tales. There is an educational moral to the plays which usually portray a battle between Malay shadow plays are sometimes considered one of the earliest examples of [[animation]]. The wayang kulit in northern states of Malaysia such as [[Kelantan]] is influenced and similar to Thai shadow puppets, while the wayang kulit in southern Malay peninsula, especially in [[Johor]] is brought from [[Javanese culture|Javanese]] [[Indonesian culture|Indonesian]] wayang kulit with slightly different on the story and performance.

The puppets are made primarily of [[leather]] and manipulated with sticks or [[domestic buffalo|buffalo]] horn handles. Shadows are cast using an [[oil lamp]] or, in modern times, a halogen light, onto a [[cotton]] cloth background. They are often associated with [[gamelan]] music.

There are several myths and legends about the origins of shadow puppetry in China. The most famous one has it that Chinese shadow puppetry originated when the favorite [[concubine]] of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (156 BCE – 87 BCE) died and magician Shao-weng promised to raise her spirit. The emperor could see a shadow that looked like her move behind the curtains that the magician had placed around some lit torches. It is often told that the magician used a shadow puppet, but the original text in ''[[Book of Han]]'' gives no reason to believe in a relation to shadow puppetry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aZu9Cje8TfkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=shadow%20theatre%20history&amp;pg=PA22#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Chinese Shadow Theatre: History, Popular Religion, and Women Warriors|author=Fan Pen Li Chen|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there are many earlier records of all kinds of puppetry in China, clear mention of Chinese shadow play does not occur until the [[Northern Song]] dynasty (960–1127). A 1235 book mentions that the puppets were initially cut out of paper, but later made of colored leather or parchment. The stories were mostly based on history and half fact half fiction, but comedies were also performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dolby |first1=William |title=The Origins of Chinese Puppetry |journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London |date=1978 |volume=41 |issue=1 |pages=97–120 |jstor=615625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre became quite popular as early as the [[Song Dynasty]] when holidays were marked by the presentation of many shadow plays. During the [[Ming Dynasty]] there were 40 to 50 shadow show [[wiktionary:troupe|troupe]]s in the city of [[Beijing]] alone.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} The earliest shadow theatre screens were made of [[Rice paper|mulberry paper]]. The storytellers generally used the art to tell events between various war kingdoms or stories of [[Buddhist]] sources.&lt;ref name="Ewart"&gt;Ewart, Franzeska G. [1998] (1998).

In [[Gansu]] province, it is accompanied by [[Music of Gansu|Daoqing]] music, while in [[Jilin]], accompanying [[Music of Jilin|Huanglong]] music forms some of the basis of modern opera.&lt;ref name="Cvista"&gt;Chinavista.

===Taiwan Ping===
The origins of [[Taiwan]]'s shadow puppetry can be traced to the [[Chaozhou|Chaochow]] school of shadow puppet theatre. Commonly known as leather monkey shows or leather shows, the shadow plays were popular in [[Tainan City|Tainan]], [[Kaohsiung]], and [[Pingtung City|Pingtung]] as early as the [[Qing dynasty]] (1644-1911 A.D.). Older puppeteers estimate that there were at least a hundred shadow puppet troupes in southern Taiwan in the closing years of the Qing. Traditionally, the eight to 12-inch puppet figures, and the stage scenery and props such as furniture, natural scenery, pagodas, halls, and plants are all cut from leather. As shadow puppetry is based on light penetrating through a translucent sheet of cloth, the "shadows" are actually silhouettes seen by the audience in profile or face on. Taiwan's shadow plays are accompanied by Chaochow melodies which are often called "priest's melodies" owing to their similarity with the music used by Taoist priests at funerals. A large repertoire of some 300 scripts of the southern school of drama used in shadow puppetry and dating back to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries has been preserved in Taiwan and is considered to be a priceless cultural asset.

===Terminology===
A number of terms are used to describe the different forms.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

* 皮影戏, píyĭngxì is a shadow theatre using leather puppets. The figures are usually moved behind a thin screen and is not entirely a show of shadows as it is more of a silhouette shadow. This gives the figures some color, and is not 100% black and white.
* 纸影戏, zhĭyĭngxì is paper shadow theatre.
* 中国影戏, Zhōngguó yĭngxì is Chinese shadow theatre.

==Ottoman Empire==
[[File:Karagoz figures.jpg|thumb|Shadow play Karagöz puppets from Turkey]]
A more bawdy comedy tradition of shadow play was widespread throughout the [[Ottoman Empire]], possibly since the late 14th century. It was centered around the contrasting interaction between the figures [[Karagöz and Hacivat]]: an unprincipled peasant and his fussy, educated companion. Together with other characters they represented all the major ethnic and social groups in Ottoman culture.&lt;ref&gt;Emin Şenyer: [http://www.karagoz.net/english/shadowplay.htm Karagoz Traditional Turkish Shadow Theatre]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Schneider | first= Irene |pages= 193 | chapter= Ebussuud |editor= Michael Stolleis (ed.) |title= Juristen: ein biographisches Lexikon; von der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert |edition= 2nd |year= 2001 |publisher= Beck |location= München |language= German |isbn= 3-406-45957-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was usually performed by a single puppet master, who voiced up to dozens of characters, and could be assisted by an apprentice handing him the puppets. The show could be introduced by a singer, accompanied by a tambourine player.&lt;ref name=Alok/&gt; Its origins are obscure, though probably deriving from an Asian source.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Karagöz theatre puppets have jointed limbs and are made from camel or buffalo hide. The hide is made transparent and colored, resulting in colorful projections. Puppets are typically 35–40 centimeters in height.&lt;ref name=Alok&gt;Ersin Alok, "Karagöz-Hacivat: The Turkish Shadow Play", ''Skylife - Şubat'' ([[Turkish Airlines]] inflight magazine), February 1996, p. 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century these characters were adapted to the Greek language and culture, ''Karagöz and Hacivat'' becoming [[Karagiozis]] and [[Hadjiavatis]] with each of the characters assuming stereotypically Greek personalities. This tradition thrived throughout [[Greece]] after independence as popular entertainment for a largely adult audience, particularly before competition arose from television. The stories did, however, retain the period setting in the late years of the Ottoman Empire. Karagiozis theatre has undergone some revival in recent years, with the intended audience tending to be largely juvenile.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

Karagöz theatre was also adapted in Egypt and North Africa.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1&gt;David Robinson in ''Light and Movement", Chapter 1, 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

==Europe==
Via Italy the shadow theatre spread throughout Europe at the end of the 17th century. It is known that several Italian showmen performed in Germany, France and England during this period.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;
In 1675 German polymath and philosopher [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] imagined a kind of world exhibition that would show all kinds of new inventions and spectacles. In a handwritten document he supposed it should include shadow theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication|url=https://www.academia.edu/379115/Leibniz_and_the_Lantern|title=Leibniz and the Lantern|first=Deac|last=Rossell|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite publication |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Dr%C3%B4le_de_Pens%C3%A9e,_touchant_une_nouvelle_sorte_de_repr%C3%A9sentations|year=1675|title=Drôle de Pensée, touchant une nouvelle sorte de représentations|author1=Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz |accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French missionaries had taken the shadow show from China to [[France]] in 1767 and put on performances in [[Paris]] and [[Marseilles]], causing quite a stir.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} In time, the ''Ombres chinoises'' ([[French language|French]] for "Chinese Shadows") with local modification and embellishment, became the ''Ombres françaises'' and struck root in the country.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The popularity of Ombres chinoises reflected the [[chinoiserie]] fashion of the days.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;

French showman [[François Dominique Séraphin]] first presented his shadow spectacle in a [[hôtel particulier]] in [[Versailles (city)|Versailles]] in 1771. He would go on to perform at the [[Palace of Versailles]] in front of royalty. In 1784 Séraphin moved to Paris, performing his shows at his permanent theatre in the newly opened [[Palais-Royal]] from 8 September 1784. The performances would adapt to the political changes and survived the [[French Revolution]]. Séraphin developed the use of [[clockwork]] mechanisms to automate the show. His nephew took over the show after Séraphin's death in 1800 and it was continued by his heirs until the theatre closed in 1870.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Altick"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Shows of London|first=Richard Daniel|last=Altick|date=January 1978|publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0674807310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pupazzi"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/lespupazzinoirso00lemeuoft/lespupazzinoirso00lemeuoft_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "Les pupazzi noirs"|accessdate=13 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stafford"&gt;{{cite book|title=Devices of Wonder: From the World in a Box to Images on a Screen|first1=Barbara|last1=Stafford|first2=Frances|last2=Terpak|publisher=Getty Research Institute, U.S|date=1 February 2002|isbn=978-0892365906|page=77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1775 Ambrogio (also known as Ambroise and Ambrose) staged ambitious shows in Paris and London.&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;

[[File:Théatre d'Ombres in Le Chat Noir.jpg|thumb|Stagehands moving zinc figures behind the screen of the Théatre d'Ombres in Le Chat Noir]]
The art was a popular entertainment in Paris during the 19th century, especially in the famous Paris nightclub district of [[Montmartre]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} The cabaret [[Le Chat noir]] ("The Black Cat") produced 45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/events/exhibitions/in-the-musee-dorsay/exhibitions-in-the-musee-dorsay/article/le-cabaret-du-chat-noir-1881-1897-6768.html?cHash=2525e3a5cd|title=Musée d'Orsay: Le Cabaret du Chat Noir (1881-1897)}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Théatre d'ombres'' shows between 1885 and 1896 under the management of [[Rodolphe Salis]]. Behind a screen on the second floor of the establishment, the artist [[Henri Rivière (painter)|Henri Rivière]] worked with up to 20 assistants in a large, [[oxy-hydrogen]] back-lit performance area and used a double optical [[Magic lantern|lantern]] to project backgrounds. Figures were originally cardboard cut-outs, but were replaced with zinc figures since 1887. Various artists took part in the creation, including [[Steinlen]], [[Adolphe Willette]] and [[Albert Robida]]. [[Caran d'Ache]] designed circa 50 cut-outs for the very popular 1888 show ''L'Epopée''. [[Musée d'Orsay]] has circa 40 original zinc figures in its collection. Other cabarets would produce their own versions and the ''Ombres'' evolved into numerous theatrical productions and had a major influence on [[phantasmagoria]].&lt;ref name=light&amp;movement1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Spirit of Montmartre: Cabarets, Humour and the Avant-Garde, 1875-1905''. edited by Phillip Dennis Cate and Mary Shaw (1996) &lt;!--Publisher?--&gt;, excerpted on line as [http://pandora.nla.gov.au/pan/13071/20040303-0000/www.acmi.net.au/AIC/RIVIERE.html Henri Riviere: Le Chat noir and 'Shadow Theatre'], [[Australian Centre for the Moving Image]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musee-orsay.fr/en/collections/works-in-focus/decorative-arts/commentaire_id/infantry-mounting-an-assault-17678.html?tx_commentaire_pi1%5BpidLi%5D=846&amp;tx_commentaire_pi1%5Bfrom%5D=843&amp;cHash=922d5c2b6f |title=Musée d'Orsay - Works in focus: Infantry mounting an assault}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montmartre-secret.com/article-montmartre-le-cabaret-du-chat-noir-2-rue-victor-masse-salis-69278723.html|title=montmartre-secret.com - Montmartre: Le cabaret du Chat Noir (2) rue Victor Massé}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ombra francese seconda.jpg|thumb|right|alt=French shadow puppets|Part of the collection of the Museo del PRECINEMA, Padua, Italy]]
In Italy, the [[Museum of Precinema]] collezione Minici Zotti in [[Padua]] houses a collection of 70 French shadow puppets, similar to those used in the cabaret Le Chat Noir, together with an original theatre and painted backdrops, as well as two magic lanterns for projecting scenes. So far, the shadow plays identified are ''La Marche a l'étoile'' (introduced by Henri Rivière), ''Le Sphinx'' (introduced by Amédée Vignola), ''L'Âge d'or'' and ''Le Carneval de Venise'', and it is supposed that the shadow puppets were created for a tour in France or abroad at the end of the 19th century.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Nowadays, several theatre companies in France are developing the practice of shadow puppets: Le Théâtre des Ombres,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theatredesombres.free.fr/|title=Theatre des Ombres : une compagnie spécialisée dans le théâtre d'ombreset les ombres chinoises, la réalisation de spectacles d'ombres, lesreprésentations de spectacles d'ombre chinoise, atelier et spectacle de théâtre d'ombre, stage de theatre d'ombres, shadow puppets, shadows show, shadowtheater|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Le Théâtre du Petit Miroir, Le Théâtre Les Chaises, and La Loupiote.

==Australia==
[[Richard Bradshaw (puppeteer)|Richard Bradshaw]] is a famous Australian shadow puppeteer. His character ''Super Kangaroo'' is just one in his varied repertoire.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, D, ''Puppetry'', p.13&lt;/ref&gt; The skill of Bradshaw has been featured in television programs made by [[Jim Henson]].

The Shadow Theatre of Anaphoria&lt;ref&gt;[http://anaphoria.com/shadow.html The Shadow Theatre of Anaphoria]&lt;/ref&gt; (relocated to Australia from California) combines a mixture of reconstructed and original puppets with multiple sources of lights. The company is under the direction of [[Kraig Grady]].

Australian Indie Company ''Shadowplay Studios''' debut game ''Projection: First Light'' is inspired classic by shadow puppetry and its art style replicates the tradition shadow play canvas using black props and sepia backgrounds. They visited Richard Bradshaw to gain more insight into shadow puppetry to make their game more authentic by getting references for creating the games shadow puppet characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Projection: First Light – An Interview with Michael Chu|url=https://puppetplace.wordpress.com/2018/02/13/projection-first-light-an-interview-with-michael-chu/|website=Puppet Place News|accessdate=16 April 2018|date=13 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shadow puppetry today==

[[File:Karagoz theatre 06315.JPG|Shadow [[puppeteer]], 2006|thumb]]

In the 1910s the [[Germany|German]] animator [[Lotte Reiniger]] pioneered [[silhouette animation]] as a format, whereby shadow-play-like puppets are filmed [[stop motion|frame-by-frame]]. This technique has been kept alive by subsequent animators and is still practised today, though [[Traditional animation|cel animation]] and [[computer animation]] has also been used to imitate the look of shadow play and silhouette animation. Traditional Chinese shadow puppetry was brought to audiences in the United States in the 1920s and 1930s through the efforts of [[Pauline Benton]]. Contemporary artists such as [[Annie Katsura Rollins]] have perpetuated the medium, sometimes combining the form with Western theatre.&lt;ref name="Shadow Woman"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayter-Menzies|first=Grant|title=Shadow Woman: The Extraordinary Career of Pauline Benton|date=2013|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|isbn=978-0-7735-8909-4|pages=158–159|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=He9sAAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Annie%20Katsura%20Rollins%22&amp;pg=PA157#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shadow theatre itself is still popular in many parts of Asia. [[Prahlad Acharya]] is one famous [[India]]n magician who incorporates it into his performances.

In the 2010s, performer Tom McDonagh introduced [[Stereoscopy|3-D]] shadow puppets and use of laser-cut objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/video/08/02/2013/dark-art.html|title=Dark Art|work=Science Friday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also appears occasionally in [[Western culture|western]] [[popular culture]], for example in:
*The children's television show ''[[Bear in the Big Blue House]]''
*The [[1983 in film|1983]] film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously (film)|The Year of Living Dangerously]]'', opens with a scene from an Indonesian [[Wayang]] shadow play

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4915">[[file:Shamshan Ghat.jpg|thumb|Shamshana outside Indian village]]
A '''shmashāna''' (or '''smashan''') is a [[Hindu]] [[cremation]] ground, where dead bodies are brought to be burnt on a [[pyre]]. It is usually located near a river or body of water on the outskirts of village or town; as they are usually located near river [[ghat]]s they are also called ''smashan ghat''. 

The word has its origin from [[Sanskrit]] language: ''shma'' refers to ''shava'' ("corpse"), while ''shana'' refers to ''shanya'' ("bed").&lt;ref name="Eck1982"&gt;{{cite book|author=Diana L. Eck|title=Banaras: City of Light|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cM09AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=9 September 2012|year=1982|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|isbn=978-0-7102-0236-9|pages=33–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Debroy"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bibek Debroy, Dipavali Debroy|title=The Garuda Purana|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bHm6nKenVK4C&amp;pg=PA174|accessdate=9 September 2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=978-0-9793051-1-5|pages=174–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other [[Indian religions]] like [[Sikhism]], [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]] also use ''shmashana'' for the last rites of the dead.

==Practice==
[[File:Manikarnika Ghat close view.jpg|right|200px|thumb|[[Manikarnika Ghat]], a Shmashana [[ghat]] at [[Varanasi]], [[India]]]]

As per Hindu rites, the dead body is brought to shmashana for ''[[Antim Sanskar]]'' (last rites). At cremation ground, the chief mourner has to obtain the sacred fire from the [[Dom (caste)|Dom caste]], who reside by the shmashana and light funeral pyres (''chita'') for a fee.&lt;ref name="VidyarthiJha1979"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lalita Prasad Vidyarthi|author2=Makhan Jha|author3=Baidyanath Saraswati|title=The Sacred Complex of Kashi: A Microcosm of Indian Civilization|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yOR1hvfH8s8C&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=9 September 2012|year=1979|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|pages=60–|id=GGKEY:PC0JJ5P0BPA}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various Hindu scripts also give details of how to select the site of shmashana: it should be on northern direction of village with land sloping towards south, and it should be near a river or a source of water and should not be visible from a distance.&lt;ref name="QaisarVerma1996"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ahsan Jan Qaisar|author2=Som Prakash Verma|author3=Mohammad Habib|title=Art and Culture: Endeavours in Interpretation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7BaVwfpWZgUC&amp;pg=RA2-PA131|accessdate=9 September 2012|date=1 December 1996|publisher=Abhinav Publications|isbn=978-81-7017-315-1|pages=2–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dead bodies are traditionally cremated on a [[funeral pyre]] usually made of wood. However, nowadays in many cities of [[India]] there are electric or gas based furnaces used in indoor crematoria.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120926070024/http://www.architexturez.net/doc/c8d701e2-bf6b-a564-61ce-502bb07b82ae A modern indoor Electric crematorium in Surat, India]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_cemetery-staff-to-go-on-strike-from-may-1_1375112 Cemetery Staff Go On Strike From May 1]. DNA India, 25 May 2010 - ''At every cemetery, there is a death register karkoon (clerk), also known as a DRK, an electrician for electric crematorium, a furnace operator and labourers.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual role==
The shmashana is said to be abode of ghosts, evil spirits, fierce deities, [[Tantra|tantrics]]. Therefore, people in general prefer to avoid going near shmashan at night. Per [[Hindu]] rituals women do not go to shamshana, only males go to shmashana to perform last rites. Only the [[Domba|Doms]] and [[Chandala]]s reside in or near Shamshana.

Shmashana is a place, where followers of [[Vamamarga]] like [[Aghori]], [[Kapalika]], [[Kashmiri Shaivism]], [[Kaula (Hinduism)|Kaula]]  of now scarce Indian tantric traditions do [[sadahna]] (for example [[Shava sadhana]]) and rituals to worship [[Kali]], [[Tara (Devi)|Tara]], [[Bhairava|Bhairav]], [[Bhairavi]], [[Dakini]], [[Vetal]], etc. invoke occult powers within them.  Shmashana is also used for similar purpose by followers of [[Tibetan Buddhist]] traditions of [[Vajrayana]], [[Dzogchen]] for [[sadhna]] of [[Chöd]], [[Phowa]], [[Zhitro]], etc. The deity called [[Shmashana Adhipati]] is usually considered to be lord of Shmashana.

There are also cases of [[sattvic]] worship on smashan. For example, [[Shailendra Sharma]], a realized yogin, has been living on a smashan near the [[Govardhan hill]] since 1993. He found and installed a natural [[shivalingam]] there and began to perform daily [[Puja (Hinduism)|puja]] of [[Shiva]] worshipping.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shailendrasharma.org/biography ''Biography''] at Shailendrasharma.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of the SDGQ can be traced back to 1972 when Quebec graphic designers, Georges Beaupré and Roger Lafortune,&lt;ref name=SDGQ-historique/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapointe2014&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Continuité |issue=141 |year=2014 |pages=50–52 |title=Identité graphique |first=Louis |last=Lapointe |language=fr |publisher=Éditions Continuité |url=http://id.erudit.org/iderudit/72096ac}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|51}} formed a committee to found the {{lang|fr|Société des graphistes du Québec}} (SGQ).&lt;ref name=DG-historique/&gt; However, SGQ was not officially founded until 1974&lt;ref name=Brooker2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brooker |first=Kevin |title=Professional Differences |journal=Applied Arts Magazine |volume=28 |issue=5 |date=November 2013 |pages=56–65 |url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=asu&amp;AN=91936178&amp;site=ehost-live |issn=1196-1775}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DG-historique&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdgq.ca/historique.php |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091225015014/http://www.sdgq.ca/historique.php |archivedate=December 25, 2009 |title=Historique |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=History |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MNBAQ2007&gt;{{cite book |title=Québec in design |author=[[Musée national des beaux-arts du Québec]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-920496-04-0 |others=Translated by Käthe Roth |page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; when the new association was incorporated.&lt;ref name=NEQ/&gt; In 1995 the SGQ replaced the word “{{lang|fr|graphistes}}” (graphic designers or graphic artists) in its name with “{{lang|fr|designers graphiques}}” (graphic designers), changing its name to {{lang|fr|Société des designers graphiques du Québec}} (SDGQ).&lt;ref name=NEQ/&gt;&lt;ref name=SDGQ-historique/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lapointe2014/&gt;{{rp|51}}

On June 14, 2011, during its annual general meeting, the SDGQ officially launched its certification program for graphic designers in Quebec.&lt;ref name=DG-dga&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdgq.ca/DGA/QA_DGA.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622075321/http://www.sdgq.ca/DGA/QA_DGA.html |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |title=Designer graphique agréé |first=Philippe |last=Lamarre |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the SDGQ adopted a new visual identity, replacing its existing “dg” [[wordmark]] with a new “SDGQ” wordmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/decouvrir/sdgq-nouveau-site-nouvelle-identite/ |title=SDGQ : Nouveau site, nouvelle identité |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=SGDQ: New site, new identity |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification==
SDGQ members working in the field of graphic design who have accumulated a minimum of 7 years of combined professional experience and education in graphic design can apply to be certified.&lt;ref name=SDGQ-dga-qui&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/dga/qui/ |title=Qui peut devenir DGA |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=Who can become a DGA |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Candidates are required to submit their portfolios to a panel of three DGA-certified judges for an anonymous review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/dga/postuler/ |title=Postuler au titre du DGA |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=Apply for the DGA title |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the review, the candidate’s work is evaluated according to three criteria, namely, pertinence, responsibility, and creativity.&lt;ref name=SDGQ-dga-qui/&gt; Certified members are accredited with a {{lang|fr|Designer graphique agréé}}, DGA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/decouvrir/dga-un-sceau-de-qualite/ |title=DGA : Un sceau de qualité |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=DGA: A seal of quality |accessdate=July 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gdc.net/article/2011/09/28/sdgq-introduces-certification-program-for-quebec-designers |title=

DGAs are required to follow SDGQ’s code of ethics. There is a procedure in place to investigate DGAs who are accused of violating the code of ethics; violators can receive penalties up to and including having their DGA titles revoked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sdgq.ca/dga/responsabilites/ |title=Responsabilités du DGA |author=SDGQ |language=fr |trans-title=Responsibilities of the DGA |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plan to align the DGA and [[Association of Registered Graphic Designers|RGD]] certifications was announced in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.newswire.ca/en/story/934569/canadian-graphic-design-industry-takes-giant-step-forward |title=Canadian graphic design industry takes giant step forward |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |publisher=[[CNW Group]] |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RGD-partners/&gt; and the written examination portion of the process was set to harmonize within 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/database/files/library/RGDandSDGQBipartiteAgreement_FR_1.pdf |title=La RGD et la SDGQ concluent un accord bipartite |first=Lionel |last=Gadoury |language=fr  |trans-title=RGD and SDGQ reach bipartite agreement |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DGA title is considered by the Association of Registered Graphic Designers to be the French equivalent of its RGD title.&lt;ref name=RGD-partners&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rgd.ca/industry-partners.php |title=Partner Organizations |author=Association of Registered Graphic Designers |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Spine shelving''' is a [[book]]-shelving technique. Books are usually shelved upright with the spines facing out; when a book is higher than the shelf, it is usually placed sideways. Putting a book with the spine down is called spine shelving; and the opposite is called [[foredge shelving]].

'''St Robert's Church''', [[Pannal]], [[North Yorkshire]], England, also known as '''St Robert of Knaresborough Parish Church''', is a [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|Grade II* listed]] building. A 13th-century wooden church dedicated to [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]] was rebuilt in [[sandstone]] in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century by monks of the [[Trinitarian Order]] from [[List of monastic houses in West Yorkshire|Knaresborough Priory]].&lt;ref name="VCH Friars" /&gt; It was perhaps then that it was rededicated to [[Robert of Knaresborough]]. Its nave was rebuilt in the 18th&amp;nbsp;century, restored in the 19th and remodelled in the 20th. Extensions were added in the 20th&amp;nbsp;century. It is a [[parish church]], and the vicar also serves the [[Church of St Michael and All Angels, Beckwithshaw]].

==Location==
The church stands on Main Street in the historic core of the village of Pannal, at about 85 metres above sea level. Pannal is a "straggling [[Linear settlement|linear]]" village among farms, woods and former [[Quarry|quarries]]. The [[Battlement|crenellated]] church tower is a significant landmark locally.&lt;ref name="HBC conservation area appraisal"&gt;[http://www.harrogate.gov.uk/plan/Documents/Heritage%20and%20Design/Conservation%20Areas/DS-P-CAA_Pannal_130111.pdf Harrogate Borough Council: Pannal conservation area character appraisal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924025109/http://www.harrogate.gov.uk/plan/Documents/Heritage%20and%20Design/Conservation%20Areas/DS-P-CAA_Pannal_130111.pdf |date=24 September 2015 }} Retrieved 5 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The church stands opposite Pannal Hall, which from 1724 was the seat of the Bentley family: landowners whose [[Commemorative plaque|memorials]] line the walls of the [[chancel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bentleygt/pannal/pannal_hall/grainge.html Bentley family from Pannal Hall (some buried in St Roberts churchyard)] Retrieved 5 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt; The Bentleys had the right to church tithes and the duty to maintain the chancel.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;

==History==
The first record of the village is "Panhale" in the [[Pipe Rolls]] of 1170.&lt;ref name="Leaflet Welcome" /&gt; A wooden church occupied the site of the present church probably in 1250, and definitely in 1271 when the archdeacon of Rochester Witton (or William?) de Santo Martino resigned the ministry of Pannal, and when the village was also called Rosehurst.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaflet Welcome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genuki" /&gt;&lt;ref name="St Roberts website" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancestry" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/Misc/ChurchCol/WRY/Pannal.html Genuki: Ecclesiastical history, Data from the 'Collectio Rerum Ecclesiasticarum' from the year 1842] Retrieved 18 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The church was dedicated to [[Michael (archangel)|St Michael]] and was called St Michael the Archangel (or All Angels) until at least 1304.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaflet Welcome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ancestry" &gt;[http://freepages.history.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~bentleygt/pannal/churches/st_roberts.html Ancestry.com: St Roberts Church] Retrieved 5 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Its vicar became [[List of Archdeacons of Rochester|Archdeacon of Rochester]] in 1271.&lt;ref name="St Roberts website" &gt;[http://www.strobertschurch.co.uk/wordpress/?page_id=214 strobertschurch.co.uk.

Until the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, this parish church was the village's civic and judicial centre. The [[Vestry#Civil parish|parish chest]] held civil documents, and the vicar and warden held the keys. The church dispensed welfare monies and set up [[workhouse]]s and [[poorhouse]]s. The parish supported the village constable, and until the 1960s the old village [[stocks]] could be seen by the [[churchyard]] gate.&lt;ref name="Ancestry" /&gt; In 1943 the 4th&amp;nbsp;Harrogate (St Robert's) [[Scouting|scout]] troop was located at the church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harrogatescouts.co.uk/about/memorabilia.htm 1942 Harrogate and Nidderdale Scouts] Retrieved 5 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===St Robert===
{{Main|Robert of Knaresborough}}
Pannal Church is the only one in the United Kingdom dedicated to Robert of Knaresborough (1170–1218). He was born in York, the son of Touk Flower. He was ordained [[subdeacon]] and served at [[Newminster Abbey]] for four and a half months. He returned to [[Knaresborough]] to become a [[hermit]]. His patron Juliana gave him the chapel of [[Hilda of Whitby|St Hilda]] at Rudfarlington. He became known as a [[Asceticism|holy man]] and lived in various places, including [[Spofforth, North Yorkshire|Spofforth]] near Pannal. He cared for the poor, and received support from [[John, King of England|King John]], Sir William de Stuteville the son of [[Robert III de Stuteville]], and his brother who became the [[Lord Mayor of York|Mayor of York]].&lt;ref name="VCH Friars" &gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=36295&amp;strquery=Pannal Victoria County History: Friars of Knaresborough] Retrieved 5 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="St Roberts website" /&gt;

The church was [[Listed building (United Kingdom)|listed]] as Grade II*, number 1149449, on 18 July 1949 on the grounds that the [[Bell tower|tower]] and [[chancel]] constitute a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] element of the [[Stonemasonry|dressed]] and [[Course (architecture)|coursed]] [[sandstone]] structure.

The chancel is lower and narrower than the [[nave]], and was built in the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, the east window tracery dates from 1350.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt; Parts of the chancel may be remnants of the earlier 13th-century stone church.&lt;ref name="Leaflet Mini Guide" /&gt; The tower was added at the west end in the 15th or 16th&amp;nbsp;century. During the ministry of William Raper and after becoming derelict, the nave was rebuilt in 1772 with Georgian elements in the churchwarden style, including "rounded Georgian windows with amber glass, a plaster ceiling with a decorated [[cornice]], [[box pew]]s and a [[Pulpit#Protestantism|three-decker pulpit]] (all now gone).&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See image of round-headed Georgian windows: [[:File:Tarleton St Marys Church Windows.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; It was restored during the ministry of Mark Rowntree in 1882 to 1884 while the church was closed.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt; He replaced the box pews with [[Pinus rigida|pitch pine]] ones and removed the three-decker pulpit. He lowered the nave floor by {{convert|2|ft|m}} and raised the chancel floor and ceiling to create the Bentley's burial [[crypt]] below. It was probably at this time that the present [[Timber roof truss#Arch-braced truss|arch braced truss]] ceiling was installed. Before Rowntree's work, the nave floor was higher than those of the tower and chancel.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt; The same section was remodelled again in 1929 when the ceiling and some oak roof beams were replaced, and electric light installed. In 1930 perpendicular windows replaced the Georgian ones. In 1934 the church acquired an [[Organ (music)#Church organs|organ loft]] in the tower arch and the ground floor of the tower became a [[vestry]].&lt;ref name="Leaflet Mini Guide" &gt;Church leaflet: ''The Parish Church of St Robert of Knaresborough Pannal: A mini guide''&lt;/ref&gt; On the south side a porch and choir vestry were added in 1952, the glazed and polygonal [[chapter house]] was built in 1977 and the parish meeting rooms and kitchen in 1988 or 1999.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Leaflet Welcome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="St Roberts website" /&gt;&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" &gt;{{NHLE|num=1149449 |desc=II* listed building |accessdate= 5 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church exterior==
[[Image:St Roberts, Trinitarian window004.jpg|thumb|left|C14–C15 window with [[Trinitarian Order|Trinitarian cross]]]]
The tower is in [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|perpendicular]] style, in three exterior visual stages separated by stringing. On different levels it has three interior floors consisting of the vestry and its loft at the bottom, then a clock chamber whose floor is roughly level with the nave ceiling, and a bell chamber on the top floor. The bottom and middle floor levels are indistinguishable from the outside, because the diagonal [[buttress]]es run up the bottom two stages and half of the top stage, and there is exterior stringing halfway up the bottom floor but not between the bottom and middle floors. However, stringing on the exterior identifies the floor level of the bell stage. The interior chambers of the tower appear tiny because of the space taken by the spiral staircase inside its south wall. The church's ribbed west door, in a "segmental-pointed" arch with "broad [[chamfer]]" is in the lower exterior stage. The three-[[Window#Terms|light]] window above is included in the exterior second stage with the spiral staircase windows and the blue clock faces. The three-light window is hidden in the interior, being inaccessible in the vestry loft. The third stage has double, uncusped, round-headed bell-openings on all four sides, and an [[Battlement|embattled]] [[parapet]].&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt; The tower is floodlit at night.&lt;ref name="St Roberts facilities" /&gt;

The nave was rebuilt in the [[Georgian era]], and the visual evidence of this is the "rusticated quoins and the rusticated surround of a former blind north doorway." The two-light windows in perpendicular style were added in 1929, the south-east one having been shortened when the chapter house was added. The chancel is in [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|decorated style]]. It has four windows, its east window having three lights and reticulated [[tracery]], plus an [[ogee]]-headed priest's doorway on the south side.&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt; One of the chancel's [[stained glass]] windows is from Knaresborough Priory.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref name="St Roberts website" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mentioned in [[William Grainge]], ''Harrogate and the Forest of Knaresborough'', 1871&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small window in the point of an arch, showing a [[coat of arms]] with two oaks above a red and blue Trinitarian cross. The oaks may commemorate the fact that "in August 1255 [[Henry III of England|the king]] gave three oaks to the friars of the Holy Trinity for the fabric of the church of St Robert,".&lt;ref name="VCH Friars" /&gt; Pannal historian Anne Smith suggests that the object between the oaks is the gateway to the Priory.{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=10}}

On the south-west and north-west buttresses of the tower are ancient and almost-illegible carvings about {{convert|2.5|in|cm}} across, and about {{convert|3|ft|m}} from the ground. They may be [[consecration crosses]], following the tradition in which [[Anglican ministry#Bishops|Anglican bishops]] have anointed each corner of the church with [[chrism]] as part of the [[Consecration#Churches, altars, and other ritual objects|consecration]] ritual, then commemorative crosses were placed at the same points. At first sight the carvings appear to be [[Tudor rose]]s or the ''[[Fleur-de-lis|fleurs-de-lis]]'' used by English monarchs from the 14th to 18th&amp;nbsp;century, but the raised "petals" may be the gaps between the curved arms of the deeply engraved cross.&lt;ref&gt;See images: [[:File:Consecration cross St Roberts 037a.jpg]], [[:File:Consecration cross St Roberts 041.jpg]], [[:File:StRoberts 038.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Church interior==
[[Image:St Roberts Interior 023.jpg|thumb|right|[[Piscina]] and top of [[sedilia]]]]

===Sanctuary and chancel===
In the walls of the sanctuary are two [[corbel]]s which have been re-set, and they may indicate the use of a [[Lent#Associated customs|Lenten veil]]. On the sanctuary floor are early 20th&amp;nbsp;century memorial [[mosaic]]s, with a [[crypt]] below.&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt; The chancel contains a 14th&amp;nbsp;century [[piscina]] with an [[ogee]] opening, but the piscina and the top of the [[sedilia]] are low on the wall to the right of the altar, indicating a raising of the stone floor which has 17th and 19th&amp;nbsp;century [[Grave|ledgers]].&lt;ref name="St Roberts website" /&gt;&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt; It has scribed [[Stucco|render]] walls. The roof was restored in 1884, and is arch-braced with 4.5 bays.&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt;

===Nave===
The "[[Tie (engineering)#Rafter tie (and Tie-beams)|tie-beam]] roof on corbelled brackets, with cusped [[Arcade (architecture)|arcading]] over the beams" of the nave has been rebuilt and remodelled several times, but may perhaps be mainly attributed to the 19th&amp;nbsp;century works. The walls are plastered and there are floorboards under the [[pew]]s. Between the nave and the tower's ground-floor vestry is an [[Church organ#Church organs|organ]], built against the tower arch.&lt;ref name="St Roberts facilities" /&gt; [[English Heritage]] describes the fixtures in the nave and chancel as follows:&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Baptismal font|font]], probably of 1772, is of polished [[marble]] and of unusual oval shape. Its wooden canopy has a [[finial]] surmounted by a dove. The C19 [[Pulpit#Protestantism|pulpit]] is polygonal Perpendicular with a figure of the [[Good Shepherd]]. [[Pew]]s are mainly C19 and their ends have notional poppy heads. [[Choir (architecture)|Choir stalls]] have ends with scrolled foliage to the tops, and [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] blind-panelled frontals. The C19 [[altar]] table incorporates C17 panels. The east window shows the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]] (1883). There are C19 and C20 memorial tablets, and a memorial tablet to the Symeson/Simpson family set up after the death of William Simpson in 1886, by Day of Knaresborough.''&lt;sup&gt;English Heritage listing details 1149449&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; The tower and chancel arches are on polygonal shafts and built in 1929.&lt;ref name="English Heritage 1149449" /&gt;

The font is made of [[limestone]] from [[Derbyshire]], and the stone contains small fossils. The church accounts of 1686 refer to "putting a loop ring" on the font for two [[Penny (British pre-decimal coin)|pennies]]; the loop fitted on the rim of this rare oval font is still in situ, dating it to before that date. The church leaflet mentions legends of its origin in [[Fountains Abbey]] or in a [[mansion]] where the font was once a [[Wine accessory#Wine coolers|wine cooler]]. Contrary to the above listing description, it is the wooden cover and not the font which was made in 1772 and restored in 1975. The brass eagle [[lectern]] was presented to the church in 1875. The pulpit, presented to the church in 1955, is the work of Norval Paxton; this is possibly architect Norval Paxton of [[Tadcaster]] who designed the church hall (dedicated in 1947 and now demolished) at Foundry Mill Street in Seacroft. The east window in the chancel was presented by Eliza Bentley in 1883.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://services.english-heritage.org.uk/ResearchReportsPdfs/020_2008WEB.pdf English Heritage: A survey and gazetteer of places of worship 1900–2005] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323162640/http://services.english-heritage.org.uk/ResearchReportsPdfs/020_2008WEB.pdf |date=23 March 2012 }} Retrieved 9 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tower===
There is no public access to the interior of the tower. It contains three floors, a very narrow stone spiral staircase on the south side, and a roof area with a trapdoor. The staircase has steep risers and is naturally lit when the sun is in the southern quarter by three very small glazed windows, however at other times all or part of the staircase is pitch dark. The ground floor contains the vestry with its own loft above, incorporating the west window which is inaccessible to visitors. The middle floor is the clock chamber, containing a turret clock mechanism serving the three blue clock faces of the tower, and chiming on the hour. It probably dates from the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, and has been wound and maintained for generations by the local Shutt family. In recent years the cranks and clock weights were removed to Pannal Hall (where they were lost) and the clock and chime mechanism is now driven by two electric motors. The clock employs a clapper mechanism on the largest bell to chime the hour. The top floor of the tower is the bell chamber. Two of the three hung and functioning bells are dated 1669 and 1703, both re-cast by Samuel Smith of [[York]]. This might imply that the smallest bell could be contemporary with the 15th to 16th&amp;nbsp;century tower.&lt;ref name="St Roberts website" /&gt;

==Churchyard and environs==
Three stone cottages and a [[forge]] used to stand in front of the church; these were demolished in 1970 and the stone was re-used to build the church's present car-park wall. The gateposts leading from the car-park to the churchyard were once reputedly the posts for the original village stocks, which have been replaced with a replica.&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See images: [[:File:St Roberts, stocks001.jpg]] and [[:File:Pannal Church 001.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; The churchyard was enlarged by half an acre on the south side with land given by Eliza Bentley in 1868.&lt;ref name="Leaflet Welcome" /&gt; Near the south entrance there is an old [[sundial]]-base, which once said, "PB 1675, Redime Tempus", referring to St Paul in ''Ephesians'' V.16: "redeeming the time, because the days are evil".&lt;ref name="Leaflet A Walk" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kingjamesbibleonline.org/1611-Bible/book.php?book=Ephesians&amp;chapter=5&amp;verse= King James Bible online: Ephesians ch.5] Retrieved 9 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See image: [[:File:Pannal Church 007.jpg]].

==Clergy==

===Historical clergy===
[[Image:St Roberts 001.jpg|thumb|left|Rev. Mark Rowntree was vicar 1883–1920]]
This list is taken from a plaque in the nave of the church. The archdeacon of Rochester resigned the rectory of Pannal in 1271, and thus begins the list of clergy.  The first in 1271 was William de Sancto Martino, listed as Monsigneur Martyn of [[List of monastic houses in North Yorkshire|St Clements Priory]]. There followed on 5 January 1311 Thomas of Skelthorpe, a brother of Knaresborough Priory. Then came brother John Brown in 1348, the first paid vicar of Pannal, who died of the [[Black Death]] in 1349,&lt;ref name="Leaflet Welcome" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Genuki" &gt;[http://www.genuki.org.uk/big/eng/YKS/WRY/Pannal/ Genuki: information from 1820s] Retrieved 5 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; then brother William of Kent in 1349 and brother William of Pudsey in 1364. In 1369 it was brother Richard of Wakefield; in 1370 concurrently brothers William of Berkshire and William Brott. In the 15th&amp;nbsp;century it was brother John Strensall 1421, brother Will Windus 1451, brother Peter Patrington 1459, brother Lawrence Screwton or Scruton 1474, brother Christopher Craven 1475 and brother Will Yorke 1493. The 16th&amp;nbsp;century begins with brother Henry Bell in 1511, then brother John Godbehere in 1515, brother Percival Dibbs in 1524 and Prior Will Lambert in 1535. St Roberts Priory was [[Dissolution of the Monasteries|dissolved]] in 1539, and in 1549 the Chantry of St James, Pannal, was dissolved.&lt;ref name="Leaflet Welcome" /&gt; In 1677 and 1683 the ministers were William Cheldrey and William Parsons, beginning the Protestant era of the church. These were followed by a number of curates: Thomas Green 1694, Christopher Jackson, 1696 and John Wright in 1699 (d.1707). It is not known whether there was then another gap with no vicar.

The next curate was Lister Simondson in 1728.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.norfolkfamilyhistory.co.uk/DescendantsofWilliamNorfolkofOtley.pdf Descendants of William Norfolk] Retrieved 5 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The same Reverend Lister Simondson was "instituted vicar on the presentation of the king" [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] in 1745. Succeeding vicars were William Loup 1750, Robert Midgeley 1756, William Raper 1758, John Umpleby 1789, Ralph Bates Hunter 1816, and Thomas Simpson 1835. In 1836 Pannal left York [[diocese]], and joined the renewed Ripon diocese. The following clergy were William Vawdrey 1862, G.O. Brownrigg 1875, L.F. Harrison 1876, and Mark Rowntree (1838–1923) in 1883. Rowntree wrote ''Pannal, Past and Present: or, the past and present of an ancient Yorkshire Parish'' (1921).{{sfn|Rowntree|1921|p=}}&lt;ref&gt;Birth cert: Rowntree, Mark, Sep 1838, [[Malton, North Yorkshire|Malton]], 24/341. Death cert: Rowntree, Mark, Sep 1923, 84, [[Knaresborough]] 9a/111&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century it was Charles Wright 1920, Charles E. Dixon 1928, G.W.L. Martin 1948 and J.R. Shearman 1957.

;Vicars of Pannal and Beckwithshaw churches: 
Rev. John T. Scott took office in Pannal in 1978. From 1980 onwards, Pannal and Beckwithshaw churches operated as a joint benefice, sharing one vicar. After Scott came Rev. Mark De la Poer Beresford-Peirse (born 1945) 1990; he was descended from an aristocratic family.{{sfn|Smith|1999|p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.william1.co.uk/w178.htm Ancestors of Beresford-Peirse] Retrieved 9 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent was Rev.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3462">'''The Red Ettin''' or '''The Red Etin''' is a [[fairy tale]] collected by [[Joseph Jacobs]].  It was included by [[Andrew Lang]] in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==
Two widows lived in a hut, and one had two sons and the other had one—or a single widow had three sons. One day the eldest son was told by his mother to fetch water for a cake, because it was time for him to seek his fortune, and the cake was all she could give him. The can was broken, the water he brought back little, and so the cake was small. The mother offered him all of it with her curse, or half with her blessing, and he took the whole. He left behind a knife, and said if the blade grew rusty, he was dead.

[[File:Page 138 illustration in English Fairy Tales.png|thumb|Illustration from Jacob's version by [[John D. Batten]]]]
He met a shepherd, a swineherd, and a goatherd; each of the [[Rule of three (writing)|three]] told him the Red Ettin of Ireland had kidnapped the king of Scotland's daughter, but that he was not the man to rescue her. The shepherd also told him to be wary of the beasts he would meet next. They each had two heads, with four horns on each head, and the man fled them and hid in a castle. An old woman told him that it was the castle of the Red Ettin, which had three heads, and he should leave, but he begged her to hide him as best she could, for fear of the beasts.

The Red Ettin returned, soon found him, and asked him three riddles; when he could answer none of them, the Ettin turned him to stone. At home, his knife grew rusty. In the variants with three sons, the younger brother went after the elder, and met the same fate. The youngest son, or the son of the other widow, set out after him, or them. First, a raven called over his head to look out as he brought the water, and so he patched up the holes and brought back enough water for a large cake. Then he left half with his mother for her blessing.

He met an old woman on the way who asked for a piece of his cake, and he gave it to her. She, being a [[fairy]], gave him a magical wand and a great deal of advice on what to do, and vanished. The shepherd, swineherd, and goatherd told him of the Red Ettin and the king of Scotland's daughter, and said that he was the man to defeat him. He walked boldly through the beasts to the castle, striking one dead with the wand, and stayed at the castle.

The Red Ettin asked him his riddle, but the man answered and cut off the Ettin's three heads. He restored the stone and freed the women the Red Ettin held prisoner, and the king married him to his daughter.

==Commentary==
Joseph Jacobs collected a version with the three men, but suppressed one because it was repetitious.  Andrew Lang included all three young men.

'''''The Sea of Ice''''' ({{lang-de|Das Eismeer}}), also called '''''The Wreck of Hope''''' ({{lang-de|Die gescheiterte Hoffnung}}) is an [[oil painting]] of 1823–1824 by the [[German Romantic]] artist [[Caspar David Friedrich]].

==Description==

The [[Landscape painting|landscape]] depicts a shipwreck in the middle of a broken ice-sheet, whose shards have piled up after the impact. The ice has become like a monolithic tomb, or [[dolmen]], whose edges jut into the sky.

The stern of the wreck is just visible on the right. As an inscription on it confirms, this is [[HMS Griper (1813)|HMS ''Griper'']], one of two ships that took part in [[William Edward Parry]]'s 1819–1820 and 1824 expeditions to the [[North Pole]].

==Title==

The two titles originally referred to the present work and another older work by Friedrich, now missing. The lost painting was shown in 1822 at the Dresden Academy exhibition under the title ''A Wrecked Ship off the Coast of Greenland in the Moonlight. Own Invention''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Ein gescheitertes Schiff auf Grönlands Küste im Wonne-Mond. Eigene Erfindung''"&lt;/ref&gt; The present painting was first shown in 1824 at the Prague Academy exhibition under the title ''An Idealized Scene of an Arctic Sea, with a Wrecked Ship on the Heaped Masses of Ice''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Ideale Szene eines arktischen Meeres, ein gescheitertes Schiff auf den aufgetürmten Eismassen''"&lt;/ref&gt;

In Friedrich's estate this work was described as ''Ice Picture. The Disaster-stricken North Pole Expedition''.&lt;ref&gt;"Eisbild. Die verunglückte Nordpolexpedition "&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The collector [[Johann Gottlob von Quandt]] commissioned two pictures that were to symbolize the south and the north. [[Johann Martin von Rohden]] received the commission to paint ''Southern Nature in her Abundant and Majestic Splendor'',&lt;ref&gt;"''Die südliche Natur in ihrer üppigen und majestätischen Pracht''"&lt;/ref&gt; while the commission for ''Northern Nature in the whole of her Terrifying Beauty''&lt;ref&gt;"''Natur des Nordens in der ganzen Schönheit ihrer Schrecken''"&lt;/ref&gt; fell to Friedrich. However, as Schukowski in a letter dated 1821 reported, Friedrich –
{{quote| himself does not even know what he will paint; he waits for the moment of inspiration, which (in his own words) occasionally comes in a dream.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Schmied: ''Caspar David Friedrich''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Accounts of expeditions to the North Pole were occasionally published during those years which is likely how Friedrich became familiar with [[William Edward Parry]]'s 1819–1820 expedition to find the [[Northwest Passage]]. In the winter of 1820–21, Friedrich made extensive oil studies of ice floes on the river [[Elbe]], near [[Dresden]]. These were probably incorporated into ''The Sea of Ice''.

The image created a lasting impression on the French sculptor [[David d'Angers]] during his visit to [[Dresden]] in 1834, which he described as follows:

{{quote|Friedrich has a somber spirit. He has understood completely how to represent in landscape the great struggles of nature.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;}}

Overall, however, the work was seen as too radical in composition, and went unsold until after Friedrich's death in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wga.hu/html/f/friedric/3/309fried.html | title = Friedrich, Caspar David | publisher = Web Gallery of Art | accessdate = 2007-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

From the twentieth century the work has proved influential upon the arctic landscapes of [[Lawren Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;Larisey, Peter: "Light for a Cold Land: Lawren Harris's Life and Work". Dundurn, 1993. 14. {{ISBN|1-55002-188-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it directly influenced [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]]'s painting ''[[Totes Meer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Causey, Andrew. ''Paul Nash''. New York : Oxford University Press, 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  The painting has been hailed by critic [[Russell Potter]] as a key instance of the "Arctic Sublime", and an influence on later nineteenth-century polar paintings.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, Russell A. ''Arctic Spectacles: The Frozen North in Visual Culture, 1818–1875'' (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 2007), pp. 57–59 {{ISBN|0-295-98679-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect [[Thom Mayne]] references ''The Sea of Ice'' as a primary influence as to how he approaches the dynamic relationship between architecture, landscape, and nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGX640s2aDI|title=Heritage Transformed with Thom Mayne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It possibly served as an inspiration for the [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-10-31/larsen-sydney-opera-house/5060118&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Žižkov''' is a [[Prague city districts|cadastral district]] of [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]. Most of Žižkov lies in the municipal and administrative district of [[Prague 3]], except for very small parts which are in [[Prague 8]] and [[Prague 10]]. Prior to 1922, Žižkov was an independent city.

The district is named after [[Hussite]] military leader [[Jan Žižka]]. It is situated south of [[Vítkov (hill)|Vitkov]] hill, site of the [[Battle of Vitkov Hill]] on 14 July 1420, where Žižka's peasant army decisively defeated the forces of [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor]].

==General character of the neighborhood==
Žižkov was historically a [[Working class|working-class]] district, and was sometimes referred to as "Red Žižkov", because so many of its inhabitants supported [[Left-wing politics|left-wing parties]]. Before [[World War II]], it had a reputation as a rough area. This reputation spread across the whole former [[Czechoslovakia]] and it was still possible to trace it amongst the people many decades later.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

The Žižkovians were very proud of their bad reputation and up to this day they tend to refer to their neighbourhood as the "Free Republic of Žižkov".{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}  This sentiment was very often a source of inspiration for novelists or film makers. This was captured in a humorous novel by [[Vlastimil Rada]] and [[Jaroslav Žák]], ''Z tajností žižkovského podsvětí'' ("Secrets of the Žižkov Underground"), and in a 1985 film by [[Ivo Novák]], ''Fešák Hubert''.

Like many districts of the city, Žižkov today is socioeconomically diverse. It is undergoing a renewal, with many older buildings being reconstructed and restored. New fashionable cafes and restaurants are appearing and property prices are increasing rapidly. Žižkov is said to have the highest number of [[public house|pubs]] per capita of any [[city district]] in Europe{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}, with more than 300. The Palac Akropolis is recognized as a center of cultural events in the area.&lt;ref name="Prague 3" /&gt;

Two of Prague's most-visible landmarks are in Žižkov: the National Monument, with its giant statue of Jan Žižka on horseback (by Bohumil Kafka, it is the third largest equestrian statue in the world&lt;ref name="Prague 3" /&gt;); and the 216 meter-high [[Žižkov Television Tower]], Prague's tallest structure. The very large [[Olšany Cemetery]] also takes up much of the district. The adjacent [[New Jewish Cemetery, Prague|New Jewish Cemetery]], one of two historic Jewish burial places in the district (the other being the Žižkov Cemetery next to the Žižkov Tower), contains the grave of Czech-German writer [[Franz Kafka]].

[[Image:Churchill socha Zizkov 8251.JPG|thumb|upright|Monument to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] on Winston Churchill Square]]
On [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] Square, near the main railway station, is the [[University of Economics, Prague|Prague University of Economics]], the General Pension Establishment, dating from 1934 and designed by [[Devětsil|Havlíček and Honzík]] and the Churchill Statue.

Žižkov also contains several beautiful parks. Among the most popular include the Holy Cross Hill, Vitkov, the park at the Židovských furnace, and the newly renovated Paradise Garden.

Prague's biggest [[Carnival]] celebration (called ''Masopust'' in Czech) is annually held in Žižkov. It, and the wine harvest festival, attract tens of thousands of visitors each year.&lt;ref name="Prague 3" /&gt;

Žižkov is served by many tram and bus routes. The southern parts of Žižkov are served by [[Jiřího z Poděbrad]], [[Flora (Prague Metro)|Flora]] and [[Želivského]] stations on [[Line A (Prague Metro)|Line A]] of the [[Prague Metro]].

==History==
The present-day district of Žižkov was originally part of the sparsely populated countryside outside of Prague. Change came through the decision of Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] in 1358 to establish vineyards around Prague within a radius of about three miles. Residents of the ''hory viniční'' (“vineyard hills”) were given special rights, which were confirmed by other sovereigns, such as exemption from taxes.&lt;ref name="Prague 3"&gt;[http://www.praha3.cz/mestska-cast/o-mestske-casti.html About the District of Prague 3], Prague 3 government website. In Czech. Retrieved on 14 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A village named Hory Viničné, whose economy was centered on vineyards on the slopes of Vitkov Hill, was first mentioned in 1788. Other vineyard settlements, such as Hrabovka, Ohrada, Parukářka, and Pražačka, would disappear in the course of the 19th century, but they are remembered in local names. According to a census in 1837, the district (including present-day Žižkov and [[Vinohrady]]) had a total of 66 houses and estates with 169 inhabitants and 216 head of livestock.&lt;ref name="Prague 3" /&gt;

In 1679 and 1680, and again between 1713 and 1716, major plague epidemics broke out in Prague. So many citizens of Prague were killed, that in 1680 new cemeteries needed to be established outside the city walls. The city authorities specified that these cemeteries be able to accommodate one thousand burials. Cemeteries were founded by the town councils of the Old Town, New Town, and Jewish Quarter near the village of Olšany (or Volšan), in present-day Žižkov. The Old Town cemetery eventually became the heart of today's Olšany Cemetery. The Old Jewish Cemetery of Žižkov still exists, as a part of the Mahler Gardens (Czech: ''Mahlerovy sady'') adjacent to the Žižkov Television Tower.&lt;ref name = Atrium&gt;[http://pis.eunet.cz/cz/praha/pamatky/atrium Prague Information Service article on the Atrium concert venue]. Retrieved on 13 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Town cemetery, to the east of the Žižkov Jewish Cemetery, is no longer extant. Originally measuring about 50 by 100 m, this cemetery became the official cemetery of Prague's New Town in 1713.&lt;ref name = Atrium /&gt; During the French occupation of Prague in 1741 and 1742, approximately 6000 to 7000 bodies of French soldiers were buried there in shaft graves.&lt;ref&gt;Kovařík, Petr: Klíč k pražským hřbitovům (Guide to the Cemeteries of Prague). Prague. 2005. {{ISBN|80-7106-486-6}}. referenced at [[:cs:Kostel Povýšení svatého Kříže (Žižkov)|Czech Wikipedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1771, a large influenza epidemic, enhanced by famine, led to over 2000 people being buried in the cemetery that year. In 1839 the cemetery, already having a high concentration of burials in a small area (over 8,000), was closed. When Tchaikovsky Street was built in 1957, a large number of skeletal remains from the former cemetery were found.&lt;ref name = Atrium /&gt;

In June 1849, the whole area received the name Vinohrady. In 1867, Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]] renamed it Královské Vinohrady (Czech for Royal Vineyards, ''Königlich Weinberg'' in German).

After the middle of the 19th century, Prague went through tremendous growth. Construction near Prague’s city walls, however, was discouraged by the military administration, which enforced the demolition of buildings close to the fortifications because they threatened to allow a breach of the walls in the event of war. After Austria’s defeat in the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, Prague was declared an open city and, after lengthy negotiations, the municipality of Prague began with the cutting of the walls in 1874. The area near Vitkov received the majority of the railways, allowing the smooth connection of Prague and Žižkov.&lt;ref name="Prague 3" /&gt;

Žižkov, drawing on the advantage of its proximity to Prague, experienced extensive development. Earlier, as indicated by census figures, population growth in present-day Žižkov was slow and steady in the mid-19th century: 83 residents in 1843, 197 in 1850, 268 in 1857, and 292 in 1869. After 1865, however, development began in the space between Vitkov hill and Holy Cross (''Sv. Kříže'') hill and the population increased rapidly. By the 1880s, Žižkov had become a large town with 21,212 inhabitants. Another population census in 1890 counted 42,000 people in more than 750 houses!

On 16 July 1875 the Regional Committee, despite the opposition of the municipal council, divided Královské Vinohrady into two parts: Vinohrady I and Vinohrady II. The name Žižkov was officially accepted for Vinohrady I in August 1877, instead of the name Rudolfov in honor of the Austrian crown prince. Vinohrady II became Královské Vinohrady that same year. The first mayor of Žižkov was Charles Hartig, who is credited with the naming of streets, squares and houses after famous Czechs from [[Jan Hus]] to [[John Amos Comenius|Komensky]]. On 15 May 1881, Emperor Franz Josef I promoted Žižkov to the status of a city.

[[Image:Hasek-nepras-01.jpg|thumb|upright|Monument to [[Jaroslav Hašek]] on Prokop Square]]
By 1920 almost the whole district was developed; only the Ohrada area was newly built at that time. Žižkov also became one of the first neighborhoods outside of the historic city center to be connected to the tram system. The independent city of Žižkov was eventually incorporated into Prague in January 1922.

Although 19th-century Žižkov is regarded as a proletarian neighborhood, there was also industry there. The largest factory, producing matches, was founded by French entrepreneurs Sellier and Bellot at Parukářka at the time of the emergence of the city. At the beginning of the [[Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938)|First Republic]], there were smaller factories – Papírografie on Vápenka, the Strejc and Nosek precision machine plants, and a number of workshops on Kněžská luka. Small business were often hidden in the courtyards of the residential buildings.

In the early 20th century, Žižkov developed into the "[[Bohemianism|Bohemian]]" part of Prague, with many artists living or performing there. Writers [[Jaroslav Hašek]] (1883–1923) and [[Franta Sauer]] (1882–1947) wrote many of their works in Žižkov. In the 1980s, the cornerstone of a monument to Hašek was ceremonially laid on Olšanské Square, though the monument itself was eventually built on Prokop Square. Also, poet [[Jaroslav Seifert]] (1901–1986), winner of the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] in 1984, was born and spent most of his life in Žižkov.

At the end of World War I, the circle of the Bohemian writers originated the concept of the Žižkov Free Republic resistance movement. This concept was remembered by the mayor of Prague 3, Milan Český, on 25 July 2001 when the Ambassador of the [[European Union]] in the Czech Republic, Ramiro Cibrian, officially visited the city. In the spirit of the resistance, Cibrian symbolically invited Žižkov into the EU.&lt;ref&gt;"Žižkov do Evropské unie" ("Žižkov in the European Union"), ''Radniční noviny'', 7 August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the second world war Žižkov was an area of considerable activity on the part of the Czech resistance movement. This was emphasised when the [[Reinhard Heydrich]] assassination parachutists were looked after by families within the area. In particular, to this day plaques can be seen to the Moravec family on Biskupcova 7 and Jan Zelinky (almost opposite) on Biskupcova 4.

In the 1970s, the communist city government of Prague developed plans to completely rebuild the district. The narrow streets were to be widened and the old tenements replaced by precast-concrete apartment blocks. These plans, however, were repeatedly postponed and eventually discarded after the overthrow of communism in 1989.

After the [[Velvet Revolution]], often in connection with the restitution of houses, reconstruction and rehabilitation began in Žižkov. While many houses have since been renovated, the look of the neighborhood has not changed much.

===National Monument===
[[National Monument in Vitkov|The National Monument]] was established on Vítkov Hill in 1950. The 9-meter high and 16.5-ton monument to Jan Žižka by [[Bohumil Kafka]] is the third largest bronze equestrian statue in the world. The idea for the monument existed as early as 1877, but construction did not begin until 1928. A major inauguration ceremony was planned for 1938, but had to be postponed due to the [[Munich Agreement]]. The monument was only completed after World War II, but with additional elements added by Czechoslovakia’s communist rulers. In 1953, they had deceased head of state [[Klement Gottwald]] embalmed and buried in a mausoleum behind the monument. The embalming of Gottwald failed, however, and the corpse was eventually cremated in 1962. A museum opened there in October 2009.

Over the west entrance is a relief of St. [[Adalbert (mystic)|Adalbert]]. The church's tower is {{convert|72|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stovezata.praha.eu/en-church-of-st-prokop-in-zizkov.html Church of St. Prokop in Žižkov], Hundred-spired Prague. Retrieved on 10 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the interior furnishings, the most famous is a painting by [[Karel Škréta]] of [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|St. Wenceslaus]] defending Prague against the Swedes in 1649.
* [[Church of Saint Roch, Žižkov|Church of Saint Roch]], located on Olšany Square (Czech: ''Olšanské náměstí''), is the oldest church in present-day Žižkov. The Baroque structure was built between 1680 and 1682 by Jan Hainric, probably according to plans by the renowned architect [[Jean Baptiste Mathey]]. Dedicated to a patron saint of plague victims, the church was originally built as a plague chapel for the Old Town cemetery established during a plague epidemic which broke out in Prague in early 1680.
:The church’s shape is an elliptical dome (because of which the church is incorrectly called the Rotunda). Arcades stretch between the columns, supporting a gallery. The main Neo-Renaissance altar is the work of Antonin Baum and dates to 1879, when the church interior was restored and modified. In its center is a picture of an earlier period, the work of Ignác Raab in 1760, divided into two zones. At the top is the Virgin Mary as the Queen of Heaven with angels and at the bottom are patron saints invoked against plague epidemics: St. Roch, St. Sebastian, and St. Rosalia. The background of the image depicts the horror and destruction caused by the plague.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farnost-zizkov.net/?akce=kostely/roch Roman Catholic Parish of St. Procopius Church in Prague 3 – Žižkov: Church of Saint Roch]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
Before World War II, Žižkov had the highest density of [[association football|football]] clubs in Prague with more than 20 teams. The most well-known club in the neighborhood is [[FK Viktoria Žižkov]], founded in 1903. Viktoria's home ground is [[FK Viktoria Stadion]] in Žižkov. Other famous clubs included [[AFK Union Žižkov]] (the Czechoslovak Amateur champion of 1925), Werkself SS Plincner (Central Bohemian Cup finalists of 1941), and Čechie Žižkov. Under the communist regime, numerous football pitches disappeared in the course of development and with them the local clubs. Only Viktoria and Union still exist today.

The neighborhood also has a swimming pool, recently renovated with the support of the Prague 3 administration. There are also several boxing clubs.
