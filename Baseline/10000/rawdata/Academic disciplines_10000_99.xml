      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1972">'''Bayesian Cognitive Science''' (also known as Computational Cognitive Science) is a rapidly growing approach to [[cognitive science]] concerned with the [[rational analysis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Introduction|last = Anderson|first = John|publisher = Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|year = 1990|isbn = |location = |pages = |work = The Adaptive Character of Thought}}&lt;/ref&gt; of cognition through the use of [[Bayesian inference]] and [[cognitive model]]ing. The term "computational" refers to the computational level of analysis as put forth by [[David Marr (neuroscientist)|David Marr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Philosophy and the Approach|last = Marr|first = David|publisher = |year = 1971|isbn = |location = |pages = |work = Vision|url = http://web.stanford.edu/class/psych209a/ReadingsByDate/01_07/Marr82Philosophy.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This work often consists of testing the hypothesis that cognitive systems behave like rational Bayesian agents in particular types of tasks. Past work has applied this idea to [[categorization]], language, [[motor control]], [[sequence learning]], [[reinforcement learning]] and [[theory of mind]]. At other times, Bayesian rationality is ''assumed'', and the goal is to infer the knowledge that agents have, and the mental representations that they use.

It is important to contrast this with the ordinary use of [[Bayesian inference]] in cognitive science, which is independent of rational modeling (see e.g. [http://www.socsci.uci.edu/~mdlee/bgm.html Michael Lee's work]).

As a measure of its influence on the accounting industry, the [[AICPA]]'s ''[[Journal of Accountancy]]'' estimated that as many as half of the CPAs in the United States have passed the CPA Exam with the help of Becker's course.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Tysiac|first=Ken|title=CPA exam prep innovator Newton D.

Originally developed in 1957 by accountant and entrepreneur [[Newton Becker]] as a training course for fellow employees of [[Price Waterhouse]], Becker CPA Review was launched as an independent company in 1960. The company grew rapidly, and by the 1980s it had classroom locations in more than 90 cities.&lt;ref name="Sun-Times — Exam Programs" /&gt; Becker eventually sold the company to DeVry in 1996, partly due to changes in the industry.&lt;ref name="Journal of Accountancy — Newt Becker Obit" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chicago Tribune — DeVry Acquisition"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ziemba|first=Stanley|title=DeVry Acquires CPA Training Firm|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-06-20/business/9606200247_1_becker-cpa-review-devry-acquires|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=June 20, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its CPA Exam Review, Becker currently offers exam preparation for a number of other international accounting credentials: [[Certified Management Accountant]] (CMA), [[Chartered Institute of Management Accountants]] (CIMA) and Diploma in International Financial Reporting (DipIFR) certifications. Becker also provides [[continuing professional education]] (CPE) and project management training.

In 2012, Becker acquired Falcon Physician Reviews and expanded into the healthcare education field.&lt;ref name="NASDAQ — Falcon Acquisition"&gt;{{cite news|title=DeVry Unit Acquires Falcon Physician Reviews|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/article/devry-unit-acquires-falcon-physician-reviews-20120403-01222|accessdate=June 20, 2012|newspaper=NASDAQ.com|date=April 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Through Falcon, Becker now offers review programs for physicians who are preparing for the [[United States Medical Licensing Examination]] (USMLE) and the [[Comprehensive Osteopathic Medical Licensing Examination]] (COMLEX).

'''Bularchus''' was an [[Ancient Greek]] painter; Pliny indicates that he was working in the 8th century BC, during the reign of [[Candaules]], King of [[Lydia]].&lt;ref name=bryan/&gt;

==Life==
Bularchus' '' Battle of the Magnesians'', is the earliest picture of which the ancient writers have left a description. The artist appears to have flourished in the late 8th century BC, as, according to [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]], this picture was purchased for as much gold as would cover its surface by [[Candaules]], King of [[Lydia]], who died in about [[700 B.C.]]&lt;ref name=bryan/&gt;

After Bularchus we encounter a gap of upwards of two centuries and a half in the history of Greek painting. It appears, however, that it was practised on the island of [[Rhodes]], at the time of [[Anacreon]], who lived about 600 years before Christ. That poet, in his twenty-eighth and twenty-ninth [[Ode]]s, mentions the practice of  [[encaustic painting]].

The '''Chief of Naval Research''' is the senior military officer in charge of scientific research in the [[United States Navy]].  The Chief of Naval Research has a rank of Rear Admiral, and is in charge of the [[Office of Naval Research]].&lt;ref name="USC"&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|10|5022}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief of Naval Research has responsibility for [[basic research]], [[applied research]], and advanced technology development components of the Navy's [[research and development]] programs (the first three of the seven categories used in the Department of Defense research and development budget, often referred to as 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3, respectively), as well as the Navy's [[intellectual property]] policy.  The Chief of Naval Research also coordinates with other research and development agencies within the Department of the Navy, such as the Naval Warfare Centers of the Naval [[Systems command|Systems Command]]s.&lt;ref name="USC"/&gt;

Other positions in the Office of Naval Research leadership include the Vice Chief of Naval Research (a one-star admiral), the Assistant Chief of Naval Research and Commanding Officer of ONR Global (both captains), and the Executive Director and Assistant Vice Chief of Naval Research (both civilians).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leadership|url=http://www.onr.navy.mil/About-ONR/Leadership.aspx|publisher=U.S. Office of Naval Research|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Chief of Naval Research reports directly to the civilian [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development, and Acquisition)]], and is thus not organizationally subordinate to the [[Chief of Naval Operations]], the senior military officer in the entire Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Navy Organization: The Secretary of the Navy|url=http://www.navy.mil/navydata/organization/org-sec.asp|publisher=U.S. Navy|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ASN(RDA) Overall Structure|url=http://www.secnav.navy.mil/rda/Pages/ASNRDAOrgChart.aspx|publisher=Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Research, Development and Acquisition)|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sapolsky2014" /&gt;

==History==
The predecessor to the Office of Naval Research was the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development, an institution within the Navy during [[World War II]] meant to coordinate between the military-wide [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] (OSRD), [[United States Navy bureau system|Navy materiel bureaus]], and civilian research organizations.  The organization was formed in 1941 and was nicknamed the "Bird Dogs" due to their skill at finding and solving interorganizational problems.  [[Jerome Clarke Hunsaker]] was interim chief, followed by Rear Admiral [[Julius A. Furer]].  OSRD was disbanded after the war, and the Office of the Coordinator of Research and Development was incorporated into the new Navy Office of Research and Inventions, headed by Harold Bowen, which became the Office of Naval Research in 1945.&lt;ref name="OCRD"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Buderi|first1=Robert|title=Naval innovation for the 21st century : the Office of Naval Research since the end of the Cold War|date=2013|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis|isbn=9781612513065|pages=21–26|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fWRVAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA21|accessdate=30 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''conservation and restoration of silver objects''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation and protection of objects of historical and [[Silver (household)|personal value]] made from [[silver]]. When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

Historically, objects made from silver were created for religious, artistic, technical, and domestic uses. The act of [[conservation and restoration]] strives to prevent and slow the deterioration of the object as well as protecting the object for future use. The prevention and removal of surface tarnish is the primary concern of conservator-restorers when dealing with silver objects.

== Use of silver ==
[[Silver]] is a [[precious metal]] that has been mined for use as early as 4000 B.C. in [[Anatolia]] (Modern [[Turkey]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=10 History of Silver|url=http://www.925-1000.com/silverhistory.html |publisher=The Silver Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because silver is malleable and durable it has been used for many purposes which include [[jewelry]], tableware, ornaments, [[coin]]s, musical instruments and [[movie film]]. It is often used as a plating on other metals.

==Tarnish==
{{About||additional information|tarnish}} 
All metals, apart from pure gold, will corrode naturally when exposed to elements such as air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Roberge|first=Pierre|title=Gold Corrosion|url=http://corrosion-doctors.org/MatSelect/corrgold.htm|publisher=Corrosion Doctors|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; High relative humidity, moisture, and air pollutants  are common causes of corrosion in metals, including silver.&lt;ref name=Erhardt&gt;{{cite journal|last=Erhardt|first=David|author2=Charles S. Tumosa and Marion F. Mecklenburg|title=Applying science to the question of museum climate|journal=Museum Microclimates|year=2007|series=National Museum of Denmark|pages=11–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Silver is known in the chemistry world as a [[noble metal]] which means it is resistant to corrosion, but not completely.  Whether [[silver plating]] or pure silver, the composite of the metal will [[tarnish]] when exposed to air and sulfur.

Tarnish is a chemical reaction on the surface of metal (copper, brass, silver, etc.) and causes a layer of corrosion. In the case of silver tarnish, the silver combines with sulfur and forms [[silver sulfide]] ( Ag2S ) which is black. The original silver surface can be restored if the layer of silver sulfide is removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=At Home Experiment: Put a Shine on it|url=http://scifun.chem.wisc.edu/homeexpts/TARNISH.html|publisher=SciFun|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On some metals, tarnish serves as a protective layer known as a [[patina]] and is typically found on copper and bronze roofing, architectural elements, statues and bells.

===Storage and handling ===
Proper handling, storage, and treatment can help prevent deterioration of silver objects.&lt;ref name="Erhardt"/&gt; Metals are best conserved when stored in an even and low humidity atmosphere, ideally at 40% [[relative humidity]] or lower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silver tends to corrode easily when stored in damp, moist locations such as a basement because it will accelerate tarnishing. Some storage boxes contain  materials, such as wood, acidic paper, rubber, and adhesives, that can off-gas corrosive materials. Conservators wear [[Nitrile rubber|nitrile]] gloves when handling silver to prevent oils, ammonia, and salts from the skin from corroding the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preventing interaction with sulfur gases===
Sulfur-containing gases and particulates can tarnish the surface of silver. These corrosive agents can come from air pollution, paints, textiles, bacterial by-products, and other chemically treated objects or building materials. When storing silver, museum conservators wrap silver in [[sulfur]]-free tissue paper and store in a tight sealed [[polyethylene]] bag. [[Activated charcoal]] is sometimes used to absorb sulfur by placing it in the bag but not in direct contact with the object. Likewise, Pacific Silver Cloth has also been used by museums to prevent tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=99–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lacquering===
{{About||lacquering|lacquer|other uses|lacquerware}}
[[Lacquer]]ing is the process of creating a hard durable finish on the surface of an object such as wood or metal.
Polished silver is sometimes lacquered to protect against tarnish and to prevent over-polishing. There are different types of [[resin]]s that are used such as Acryloid B-72 and Incralac. If silver pieces are being displayed in the open, such as in a house or museum exhibit case, it is difficult to prevent corrosion from air exposure. A surface coating will prevent or slow tarnishing and is a service done by professionals or conservator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |pages=100–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most used coatings is Agateen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perkins|first=Beverly|title=The De-electrification and Re-electrification of Historic Lighting Fixtures at Winterthur Museum|journal=Journal of the American Institute of Conservation|year=2003|volume=42|series=6|issue=3|pages=457–462|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/jaic/articles/jaic42-03-006_3.html|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lacquer is applied to a surface that has been cleaned with [[ethanol]], [[acetone]], or [[methyl ethyl ketone]]. Oils from human hands prevent the lacquer from adhering to the silver. Agateen No. 27 ([[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]]) and [[Paraloid B-72]] are the most commonly used lacquers however there is a debate which lacquer, cellulose nitrate or acrylic, is best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wharton|first=Glenn|title=The Cleaning and Lacquering of Museum silver|journal=Western Association for Art Conservation|date=Jan 1989|volume=11|issue=1|pages=4–5|url=http://cool.conservation-us.org/waac/wn/wn11/wn11-1/wn11-103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historic methods of treating silver ==
The art of crafting objects out of silver, also known as [[silversmith]]ing, has been around for centuries. With the creation of hand-made silver objects, the issue of cleaning and caring for these items was a concern. Silversmiths would give advice to clients on how to properly care for their silver. Here are examples of instructions given by silversmiths in the 17th and 18th centuries.

: 1737 - "Clean it now and then with only warm water and soap, with a Spunge, and then wash it  with clean water, and dry it very well with a soft Linnen cloth, and keep it in a dry place, for the damp will spoyle it".&lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cripps|first=Wilfred|title=Old English Plate|year=1967|publisher=Spring Books|location=London|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:1679 - "...rubb the [[flagon]]s and [[chalice]]s from topp to the Bottome, not crosswise, but the Bason and patnes are to be rubb’d roundwise, not acrosse, and by noe means use either [[chalk]], [[sand]], or [[salt]]" &lt;ref name="Cripps 1967 17–18"/&gt;

Although dated, these instructions are very similar to current methods of cleaning and polishing of silver.

== Current practices ==
The following sections discuss the different methods in which silver objects can be cleaned and polished. Some of the methods described below can cause damage to the surface of the silver, such as scratching or accelerated tarnishing. A conservator should be consulted if there are any questions about the methods below especially when dealing with archaeological, antique or sensitive objects.&lt;ref name=cfs/&gt;

===Museum conservation practices – historical objects===

Water sensitive objects are masked in plastic wrap to avoid getting wet. A [[slurry]] of precipitated (pharmaceutical grade) [[calcium carbonate]] and [[deionized water]] is created and rubbed onto the silver piece with a cotton rag or cotton ball. It is recommended that the slurry be tested on the bottom or in a non-visible area of the silver for abrasiveness. If the slurry is too abrasive it will scratch the surface and increase the potential for future tarnishing. The polish is applied with a soft cloth and polished in a circular motion.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser&gt;{{cite book|last=Drayman-Weisser|first=T|title=Caring for Your Collections|year=1992|publisher=Harry N. Abrams Incorp|location=New York|pages=109–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Unpolished and polished silver artwork pieces.jpg|left|thumb|Parts of a silver object from [[Indianapolis Museum of Art]] collection, in the process of being polished with [[calcium carbonate]]. An unpolished piece  is on the left and a finished piece on the right.]]

[[Ethyl alcohol]] is sometimes added to the slurry mixture to help dry out excess water.  The slurry mixture is applied throughout the piece until completely polished. Dark tarnish spots are sometimes located on the surface and may need to be polished more than once to remove. Over polishing is an issue with silver and can cause harm to the surface of the metal. After polishing, the silver object is rinsed in deionized water and dried with a cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=cfs&gt;{{cite web|last=National Park Service|title=Caring for Silver and Copper Alloy Materials|url=http://www.nps.gov/museum/publications/conserveogram/10-02.pdf|work=Conserve O Gram|publisher=NPS|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once cleaned and dried the silver is wrapped in [[acid-free]] tissue paper and placed in a sealed plastic bag. A [[3M]] anti-tarnish strip is also placed in the bag to absorb any sulfur that may be in the air. The tissue paper is used as a buffer to prevent the silver surface coming into contact with the anti-tarnish strip.&lt;ref name=draymanwesser/&gt;

===Waddings===
Waddings are cloths that have been infused with an organic [[solvent]]. Because they contain solvents instead of water, they can be used for polishing metal objects that cannot be exposed to water. Polishing waddings will leave abrasive particles behind and the residue can be  removed using a soft brush or by rubbing the surface with a soft [[linen]] cloth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Selwyn|first=L|title=Care and Tarnish Removal|url=http://www.cci-icc.gc.ca/publications/notes/9-7_e.pdf|publisher=Canadian Conservation Institute|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=2017-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural methods===
The following sections include methods that use natural methods such as water and salt to clean the surface of silver. Some of the methods use heat which may be dangerous to silver tableware such as candlesticks or knife handles. Water trapped in crevices of silver objects can accelerate tarnishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bachmann |first1=Konstanze |title=Conservation Concerns: A Guide for Collectors and Curators |date=1992 |publisher=Smithsonian Institution |isbn=9781560981749 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=icJvDwAAQBAJ |language=en |page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Single Ingredient'' - [[Toothpaste]] is applied with a clean cloth as a gentle abrasive with a soft bristle toothbrush and rinsed in water.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt;

''Boiling Water Bath'' - The silver object or pieces are placed into an aluminum pot and covered with water. One [[tablespoon]] of salt and [[baking soda]] is added and boiled for three minutes. After cooling, the silver is placed into a warm soapy water mixture and cleaned with a cotton cloth and then dried with a separate cotton cloth.&lt;ref name=natural/&gt; 

''Soaking bath'' – A glass roasting pan is lined with [[aluminum foil]] with the dull side facing downwards. The silver is placed atop of the foil and a [[quart]] of boiling water is poured over the pieces with two tablespoons of baking soda. The silver soaks for five minutes and is dried with a clean cloth.&lt;ref name=natural&gt;{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Ellen|title=All Natural Way to Clean Tarnished Silver|url=http://greenliving.nationalgeographic.com/allnatural-way-clean-tarnished-silver-3214.html|publisher=National Geographic|accessdate=4 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical dips===
A popular and quick method for polishing silver is the use of chemical dips. Dips work by dissolving the tarnished surface of the silver at a highly accelerated rate. Many dips are made of [[acid]]s and other agents. Acids are very corrosive and pose a danger to the silver surface as well as to the user. Dips can be harmful to objects with sealed surfaces such as candlesticks, trophies and teapots with hollow components because the chemical could leak into the hollow area and can never be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Herman|first=Jeffrey|title=Silver Care|url=http://www.silversmithing.com/care.htm#Chemical%20Dips|publisher=Society of Silversmiths|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike museum quality polishing, employing a slurry of calcium carbonate and ionized water, dips are quicker and less expensive. However, dips are more abrasive to the surfaces of silver, gold, and other metals. NOTE: Jeffrey Herman confirms this method damages silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Tarn-X Tarnish Remover Review and Other Silver Dips - WARNING! |url=http://www.hermansilver.com/tarn-x.htm |website=www.hermansilver.com |accessdate=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser cleaning===
Can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=SALIMBENI |first1=RENZO |title=LASER TECHNIQUES FOR CONSERVATION OF ARTWORKS |url=http://www.ace.hu/am/2006_1/AM-2006-1-RS.pdf |publisher=Institute of Applied Physics “Nello Carrara”- CNR, |accessdate=1 October 2013 |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The above process wil naturally lead to the cleaning of silver, which is passed through lasers to remove any dirt and pollutants.

===Plasma cleaning===
Can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schmidt-Otta |first1=K |title=Plasma-Reduction: Its Potential for Use in the Conservation of Metals |url=http://www.nma.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/346055/NMA_metals_s3_p01_plasma_reduction.pdf |accessdate=1 October 2013 |date=October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.panna-project.eu/work-packages/wp-3/cleaning-of-a-tarnished-daguerreotype.html |title=Cleaning treatment of a tarnished Daguerreotype by using the reducing afterglow of an atmospheric plasma |accessdate=2013-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927080603/http://www.panna-project.eu/work-packages/wp-3/cleaning-of-a-tarnished-daguerreotype.html |archivedate=2013-09-27 |df= }}  Accessed 1.10.2013.&lt;/ref&gt;
Plasma cleaning

===Polishing wheels===
{{About||metal polishing|polishing (metalworking)|other uses|polishing}}
Polishing wheels, also known as buffing wheels or polishing mops, use a specific electric tool to physically remove tarnish from the surface rather than chemically as with the calcium carbonate slurry or commercial dips.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Because silver is soft,  the surface can be easily cut or scratched. The main buffing type used for silver, gold, and plated objects is Canton flannel. This flannel is made of very soft material and will not scratch the plated, lacquered, or other soft surfaces.&lt;ref name=wheel/&gt;

Along with buffing wheels, particular compounds are used to help polish the material. Two main types of compounds used for silver and gold surfaces are red and blue compounds. Red, also known as [[jeweler's rouge]], polishes without any cutting action. The blue compound is a dryer compound and is used with a grease-less wheel that also does not cut or scratch the surface.&lt;ref name=wheel&gt;{{cite web|last=Caswell Electroplating in Miniature|title=How to Buff and Polish: An Introduction to Buffing &amp; Polishing|url=http://www.caswellplating.com/buffman.htm|publisher=Caswell Inc.|accessdate=7 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Museum conservation practices - Archaeology objects==
[[File:Miletopoli (oggi mysia in turchia), medaglioni ellenistici in argento, II-I sec ac. 02.JPG|thumb|right|Hellenistic silver medallion, partly gilt, Miletopoli,2nd-1st centuries BC,after conservation, Antikensammlung Berlin]]
Archaeological silver objects are particularly sensitive to mistakes in planning or carrying out conservation restoration. The essential problem connected with archaeological silver objects is brittleness.&lt;ref&gt;Wanhill, R.J.H., 2000, Brittle archaeological silver. Identification, restoration and conservation, Materialen, 16, 30– 5; also NLR Technical Publication NLR.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain objects, such as those that are completely mineralized, nielloed, or gil, are particularly problematic.  When dealing with archaeological objects, reversible processes, such as the use of Paraloid B-72 glue, are preferred to permanent treatments.

Benzotriazole can be used as corrosion inhibitor for archaeological importance. Suitable protective coatings include Paraloid B-72 (or Paraloid B 67 - soluble in white spirit) and Renaissance Wax.

[[File:Real African people working on their little farm in Freetown.jpg|thumb|Traveler from [[Australia]] visiting a small farm in [[Sierra Leone]].]]
'''Culture shock''' is an experience a person may have when one moves to a cultural environment which is different from one's own; it is also the personal disorientation a person may feel when experiencing an unfamiliar way of life due to immigration or a visit to a new country, a move between social environments, or simply transition to another type of life.&lt;ref&gt;Macionis, John, and Linda Gerber. "Chapter 3 - Culture." Sociology. 7th edition ed. Toronto, ON: Pearson Canada Inc., 2010. 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most common causes of culture shock involves individuals in a foreign environment. Culture shock can be described as consisting of at least one of four distinct phases: [[honeymoon]], negotiation, adjustment, and adaptation. 

Common problems include: [[information overload]], [[language barrier]], [[generation gap]], [[technology gap]], skill interdependence, formulation dependency, [[homesickness]] (cultural), boredom (job dependency), response ability [[Cross-cultural capital|(cultural skill set)]].&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, Paul. The Five Stages of Culture Shock: Critical Incidents Around the World. Contributions in psychology, no. 25. Westport, Conn: Greenwood Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no true way to entirely prevent culture shock, as individuals in any society are personally affected by cultural contrasts differently.&lt;ref&gt;Barna, LaRay M.

==Four phases==

=== Honeymoon ===
During this period, the differences between the old and new culture are seen in a romantic light. For example, in moving to a new country, an individual might love the new food, the pace of life, and the locals' habits. During the first few weeks, most people are fascinated by the new culture. They associate with nationals who speak their language, and who are polite to the foreigners. Like most [[honeymoon]] periods, this stage eventually ends.&lt;ref&gt;Oberg, Dr. Kalervo. "Culture Shock and the problem of Adjustment to the new cultural environments". World Wide Classroom Consortium for International Education &amp; Multicultural studies. 29 Sept 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation===
After some time (usually around three months, depending on the individual), differences between the old and new culture become apparent and may create [[anxiety]]. Excitement may eventually give way to unpleasant feelings of frustration and anger as one continues to experience unfavorable events that may be perceived as strange and offensive to one's cultural attitude. Language barriers, stark differences in public hygiene, traffic safety, food accessibility and quality may heighten the sense of disconnection from the surroundings.&lt;ref&gt;Mavrides, Gregory PhD “Culture Shock and Clinical Depression.” Foreign Teachers Guide to Living and Working in China. Middle Kingdom Life, 2009. Web. 29 Sept. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

While being transferred into a different environment puts special pressure on communication skills, there are practical difficulties to overcome, such as [[circadian rhythm]] disruption that often leads to [[insomnia]] and daylight drowsiness; adaptation of [[gut flora]] to different [[bacteria]] levels and concentrations in food and water; difficulty in seeking treatment for illness, as medicines may have different names from the native country's and the same [[active ingredient]]s might be hard to recognize.

Still, the most important change in the period is communication: People adjusting to a new culture often feel [[Loneliness|lonely]] and homesick because they are not yet used to the new environment and meet people with whom they are not familiar every day. The language barrier may become a major obstacle in creating new relationships: special attention must be paid to one's and others' culture-specific [[body language]] signs, linguistic faux pas, conversation tone, linguistic nuances and customs, and [[false friends]]. 

In the case of students studying abroad, some develop additional symptoms of loneliness that ultimately affect their lifestyles as a whole. Due to the strain of living in a different country without parental support, international students often feel anxious and feel more pressure while adjusting to new cultures—even more so when the cultural distances are wide, as patterns of [[logic]] and [[speech]] are different and a special emphasis is put on [[rhetoric]].

=== Adjustment ===
Again, after some time (usually 6 to 12 months), one grows accustomed to the new culture and develops routines. One knows what to expect in most situations and the host country no longer feels all that new. One becomes concerned with basic living again, and things become more "normal". One starts to develop problem-solving skills for dealing with the culture and begins to accept the culture's ways with a [[Optimism|positive attitude]]. The culture begins to make sense, and negative reactions and responses to the culture are reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thewanderlanders.com/the-four-stages-of-adjusting-to-a-new-culture/|title=Adjust To New Cultures Like A Pro|first=|last=Sarah|date=25 May 2016|website=thewanderlanders.com|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adaptation===
In the mastery stage individuals are able to participate fully and comfortably in the host culture. Mastery does not mean total conversion; people often keep many traits from their earlier culture, such as accents and languages. It is often referred to as the [[Bicultural identity|bicultural]] stage.

==Reverse culture shock==
'''Reverse culture shock''' (also known as "re-entry shock" or "own culture shock"&lt;ref&gt;[[Martin Woesler]], A new model of intercultural communication – critically reviewing, combining and further developing the basic models of Permutter, Yoshikawa, Hall, [[Geert Hofstede]], Thomas, Hallpike, and the social-constructivism, Bochum/Berlin 2009, book series Comparative Cultural Sciences vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt;) may take place—returning to one's home culture after growing accustomed to a new one can produce the same effects as described above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20161104-how-expats-cope-with-losing-their-identity |title=How expats cope with losing their identity |last=Clarke |first=Laura |date=6 November 2016 |website=BBC Capital |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.com/capital/story/20130611-returning-expat-culture-shock|title=Expat culture shock boomerangs in the office|last=Garone|first=Elizabeth|date=3 November 2014|website=BBC Capital |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These are results from the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] and psychological consequences of the readjustment process to the primary culture.&lt;ref&gt;Huff, Jennifer L. "Parental attachment, reverse culture shock, perceived social support, and college adjustment of missionary children." Journal of Psychology &amp; Theology 29.3 (2001): 246-264.29 Sept 2009.Web&lt;/ref&gt; The affected person often finds this more surprising and difficult to deal with than the original culture shock.  This phenomenon, the reactions that members of the re-entered culture exhibit toward the re-entrant, and the inevitability of the two are encapsulated in the following saying, which is also the title of a book by [[Thomas Wolfe]], ''[[You Can't Go Home Again]]''.

Reverse culture shock is generally made up of two parts: idealization and expectations. When an extended period of time is spent abroad we focus on the good from our past, cut out the bad, and create an idealized version of the past. Secondly, once removed from our familiar setting and placed in a foreign one we incorrectly assume that our previous world has not changed.  We expect things to remain exactly the same as when we left them. The realization that life back home is now different, that the world has continued without us, and the process of readjusting to these new conditions as well as actualizing our new perceptions about the world with our old way of living causes discomfort and psychological anguish. &lt;ref&gt;Martin, Hank "Dealing with Reverse Culture Shock." Breaking Trail Online. http://brktrail.com/rshock/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==
There are three basic outcomes of the Adjustment Phase:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Winkelman|first1=Michael|title=Cultural Shock and Adaptation|journal=Journal of Counseling &amp; Development|date=1994|volume=73|issue=2|pages=121-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people find it impossible to accept the foreign culture and to [[Social integration|integrate]]. They isolate themselves from the host country's environment, which they come to perceive as hostile, withdraw into an (often mental) "[[ghetto]]" and see return to their own culture as the only way out. These "Rejectors" also have the greatest problems re-integrating back home after return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winant|first1=Howard|title=The World Is A Ghetto|date=2001|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-465-04341-0|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Some people integrate fully and take on all parts of the host culture while losing their original identity. This is called [[cultural assimilation]]. They normally remain in the host country forever. This group is sometimes known as "Adopters" and describes approximately 10% of expatriates.
* Some people manage to adapt to the aspects of the host culture they see as positive, while keeping some of their own and creating their unique blend. They have no major problems returning home or relocating elsewhere. This group can be thought to be [[Cosmopolitanism|cosmopolitan]]. Approximately 30% of expats belong to this group.{{cn|date=June 2015}}

Culture shock has many different effects, time spans, and degrees of severity.&lt;ref&gt;Christofi, Victoria, and Charles L. Thompson "You Cannot Go Home Again: A Phenomenological Investigation of Returning to the Sojourn Country After Studying Abroad." Journal of Counselling &amp; Development 85.1 (2007): 53-63. SocINDEX with Full Text. EBSCO. Web. 15 Oct. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many people are handicapped by its presence and do not recognize what is bothering them.{{fact|date=October 2013}}

==Transition shock==
Culture shock is a subcategory of a more universal construct called transition shock. Transition shock is a state of loss and disorientation predicated by a change in one's familiar environment that requires adjustment. There are many symptoms of transition shock, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CESA|title=Dealing with culture shock|website=Management Entity: Office of International Research, Education, and Development|accessdate= 29 September 2009|url=http://www.oired.vt.edu/cesa/currentstudents/cs_culturalshock.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Anger
* Boredom
* Compulsive eating/drinking/weight gain
* Desire for home and old friends
* Excessive concern over cleanliness 
* Excessive sleep
* Feelings of helplessness and withdrawal
* Getting "stuck" on one thing
* Glazed stare

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3836">The '''Duetto buffo di due gatti''' ("humorous [[Duet (music)|duet]] for two cats") is a popular performance piece for two [[soprano]]s which is often performed as a concert [[encore (concert)|encore]]. The "lyrics" consist entirely of the repeated word "miau" ("[[Cat communication|meow]]"). Sometimes it is also performed by a soprano and a tenor, or a soprano and a bass.

While the piece is typically attributed to [[Gioachino Rossini]], it was not actually written by him, but is instead a compilation written in 1825 that draws principally on his 1816 [[opera]], ''[[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]]''. Hubert Hunt putatively claims that the compiler was [[Robert Lucas de Pearsall]], who for this purpose adopted the [[pseudonym]] "G. Berthold".&lt;ref&gt;Hubert Hunt, ''Robert Lucas Pearsall: the Compleat Gentleman and His Music, 1795-1856''. Chesham Bois (1977); Chris Woodstra. ''All Music Guide to Classical Music'', 2005, p. 1126.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==
In order of appearance, the piece consists of:
*the "Katte-Cavatine" by the Danish composer [[Christopher Ernst Friedrich Weyse|C.E.F. Weyse]]&lt;ref&gt;Richard Osborne: ''Rossini''. London: Dent (1986), p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;
*part of the duet for Otello and Iago in Act 2 of ''Otello''
*part of the cabaletta to the aria "Ah, come mai non senti", sung by Rodrigo in the same act

==Recordings==
Some [[albums]] including this piece are:

*''A Tribute to Gerald Moore'', [[EMI Classics]]: [[Victoria de los Ángeles]] (soprano), [[Elisabeth Schwarzkopf]] (soprano), [[Gerald Moore]] ([[piano]]), released 2003 (expanded reissue of 1969  release), also known as "Le Duo des Chats"

'''Ear training''' or '''aural skills''' is a skill by which [[musician]]s learn to identify, solely by hearing, [[pitch (music)|pitche]]s, [[interval (music)|interval]]s, [[melody (music)|melody]], [[chord (music)|chord]]s, [[rhythm]]s, and other basic elements of [[music]].  The application of this skill is analogous to taking dictation in written/spoken language.  As a process, ear training is in essence the inverse of [[sight-singing]], the latter being analogous to reading a written text aloud without prior opportunity to review the material. Ear training is typically a component of formal musical training.

== Functional pitch recognition ==

Functional pitch recognition involves identifying the function or role of a single pitch in the context of an established [[Tonic (music)|tonic]]. Once a tonic has been established, each subsequent pitch may be classified without direct reference to accompanying pitches.  For example, once the tonic G has been established, listeners may recognize that the pitch D plays the role of the dominant in the key of G. No reference to any other pitch is required to establish this fact.

Many musicians use functional pitch recognition in order to identify, understand, and appreciate the roles and meanings of pitches within a key.  To this end, scale-degree numbers or movable-''do'' [[solmization]] (''do, re, mi,'' etc.) can be quite helpful.  Using such systems, pitches with identical functions (the key note or tonic, for example) are associated with identical labels (''1'' or ''do,'' for example).

Functional pitch recognition is not the same as fixed-''do'' [[solfège]], e.g. ''do, re, mi'', etc. Functional pitch recognition emphasizes the role of a pitch with respect to the tonic, while fixed-''do'' solfège symbols are labels for absolute pitch values (''do''=C, ''re''=D, etc., in any key). In the fixed-''do'' system (used in the conservatories of the Romance language nations, e.g. Paris, Madrid, Rome, as well as the [[Juilliard School]] and the [[Curtis Institute]] in the USA), solfège symbols do not describe the role of pitches relative to a tonic, but rather actual pitches. In the movable-do system, there happens to be a correspondence between the solfège symbol and a pitch's role. However, there is no requirement that musicians associate the solfège symbols with the scale degrees. In fact, musicians may utilize the movable-''do'' system to label pitches while mentally tracking intervals to determine the sequence of solfège symbols.

Functional pitch recognition has several strengths. Since a large body of music is tonal, the technique is widely applicable. Since reference pitches are not required, music may be broken up by complex and difficult to analyze pitch clusters, for example, a percussion sequence, and pitch analysis may resume immediately once an easier to identify pitch is played, for example, by a trumpet—no need to keep track of the last note of the previous line or solo nor any need to keep track of a series of intervals going back all the way to the start of a piece. Since the function of pitch classes is a key element, the problem of compound intervals with interval recognition is not an issue—whether the notes in a melody are played within a single octave or over many octaves is irrelevant.

Functional pitch recognition has some weaknesses. Music with no tonic or ambiguous tonality&lt;ref&gt;For the cognitive foundations of atonality,  see Humphries, Lee. [http://www.thinkingapplied.com/tonality_folder/tonality.htm "Atonality, Information, and the Politics of Perception"], ''Enclitic'', Vol. III, No. 1 (Spring, 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; does not provide the frame of reference necessary for this type of analysis. When dealing with key changes, a student must know how to account for pitch function recognition after the key changes: retain the original tonic or change the frame of reference to the new tonic. This last aspect in particular, requires an ongoing real-time (even anticipatory) analysis of the music that is complicated by modulations and is the chief detriment to the movable-do system.

== Interval recognition ==
{{Main|Interval recognition}}

[[Interval (music)|Interval]] recognition is also a useful skill for musicians: in order to determine the notes in a [[melody]], a musician must have some ability to recognize intervals. Some music teachers teach their students relative pitch by having them associate each possible interval with the first two notes of a popular song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Mayfield, Connie E. | year=2002 | title=Theory Essentials, Volume I: An Integrated Approach to Harmony, Ear Training, and Keyboard Skills | publisher=Schirmer | location=New York | isbn=0-534-57231-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others have shown that such familiar-melody associations are quite limited in scope, applicable only to the specific scale-degrees found in each melody.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, Michael (1983): "Beyond Intervals: The Teaching of Tonal Hearing," ''Journal of Music Theory Pedagogy'', (6):18-34&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, there are various systems (including [[solfeggio]], [[sargam (music)|sargam]], and [[numerical sight-singing]]) that assign specific syllables to different notes of the [[scale (music)|scale]]. Among other things, this makes it easier to hear how intervals sound in different contexts, such as starting on different notes of the same scale.

== Chord recognition ==
Complementary to recognizing the melody of a song is hearing the harmonic structures that support it. Musicians often practise hearing different types of chords and their [[Inverted chord|inversions]] out of context, just to hear the characteristic sound of the chord. They also learn [[chord progression]]s to hear how chords relate to one another in the context of a piece of music.

== Microtonal chord and interval recognition ==

The process is similar to twelve-tone ear training, but with many more intervals to distinguish. Aspects of microtonal ear training are covered in  ''Harmonic Experience'', by [[W. A. Mathieu]], with sight-singing exercises, such as singing over a [[Drone_(music)|drone]], to learn to recognize just intonation intervals. There are also software projects underway or completed geared to ear training or to assist in microtonal performance.

Gro Shetelig at The Norwegian Academy of Music is working on the development of a Microtonal Ear Training method for singers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassethoresen.com/concrescence/index.html The Concrescence Project] Artistic Director Professor Lasse Thoresen, Norwegian Academy, Oslo&lt;/ref&gt; and has developed the software Micropalette,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lassethoresen.com/concrescence/micropalette.html Micropalette] from Concrescence&lt;/ref&gt; a tool for listening to microtonal tones, chords and intervals. Aaron Hunt at Hi Pi instruments has developed Xentone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-pi.com/XENTsoftware.html Xentone] at Hi Pi Instruments&lt;/ref&gt; another tool for microtonal ear training.

== Rhythm recognition ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}
One way musicians practise rhythms is by breaking them up into smaller, more easily identifiable sub-patterns. For example, one might start by learning the sound of all the combinations of four [[eighth note]]s and eighth rests, and then proceed to string different four-note patterns together.

Another way to practise rhythms is by [[muscle memory]], or teaching rhythm to different muscles in the body. One may start by tapping a rhythm with the hands and feet individually, or singing a rhythm on a syllable (e.g. "ta"). Later stages may combine keeping time with the hand, foot, or voice and simultaneously tapping out the rhythm, and beating out multiple overlapping rhythms.

A [[metronome]] may be used to assist in maintaining accurate tempo.

== Timbre recognition ==
Each type of musical instrument has a characteristic sound quality that is largely independent of pitch or loudness. Some instruments have more than one timbre, e.g. the sound of a plucked violin is different from the sound of a bowed violin.  Some instruments employ multiple manual or [[embouchure]] techniques to achieve the same pitch through a variety of timbres.  If these timbres are essential to the melody or function, as in [[shakuhachi]] music, then pitch training alone will not be enough to fully recognize the music.  Learning to identify and differentiate various timbres is an important musical skill that can be acquired and improved by training.

== Transcription ==
Music teachers often recommend [[Transcription (music)|transcribing]] recorded music as a way to practise all of the above, including recognizing rhythm, melody and harmony. The teacher may also perform (‘dictate’) short compositions, with the pupil listening and transcribing them on to paper.

== Modern training methods ==
For accurate identification and reproduction of musical intervals, scales, chords, rhythms, and other audible parameters a great deal of practice is often necessary. Exercises involving identification often require a knowledgeable partner to play the passages in question and to assess the answers given. Specialised [[music theory]] software can remove the need for a partner, customise the training to the user’s needs and accurately track progress. Conservatories and university music departments often license commercial software for their students, such as [[Meludia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.classicalsource.com/db_control/db_news.php?id=3528 Meludia becomes the first online interactive educational method recognized by The Curtis Institute of Music]&lt;/ref&gt; [[EarMaster]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/drew.waters/elementary120b_home.htm Plattsburgh State - Dr. Drew Waters&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303173107/http://faculty.plattsburgh.edu/drew.waters/elementary120b_home.htm |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auralia (software)|Auralia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.risingsoftware.com/auralia/ Published by Rising Software&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csub.edu/catalog/_files/2009-2011_updated/022-009.pdf Teaching Music With Technology]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ulm.edu/~everett/auralskills.html Dr. Micah Everett - ULM Division of Music - Aural Skills Course Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212201159/http://www.ulm.edu/~everett/auralskills.html |date=2012-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and MacGAMUT,&lt;ref&gt;[http://faculty.augie.edu/~randrews/theory/Course_main.html Augustana College Music Theory courses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514002441/http://faculty.augie.edu/~randrews/theory/Course_main.html |date=2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they can track and manage student scores on a computer network. A variety of free software also exists, either as browser-based applications or as downloadable executables. For example, [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]] under the [[GPL]], such as [[GNU Solfege]], often provides many features comparable with those of popular [[proprietary software|proprietary]] products.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Most ear-training software is [[MIDI]]-based, permitting the user to customise the instruments used and even to receive input from [[MIDI controller|MIDI-compatible devices]] such as [[electronic keyboard]]s.

'''Edith Halpert''' or '''Edith Gregor Halpert''' (née Edith Gregoryevna Fivoosiovitch) (1900–1970) was a pioneering [[New York City]] [[Art dealer|dealer]] of [[American modernism|American modern art]] and [[American Folk Art|American folk art]]. She brought recognition and market success to many [[avant-garde]] American artists. Her establishment, the Downtown Gallery, was the first commercial art space in [[Greenwich Village]]. When it was founded in 1926, it was the only New York gallery dedicated exclusively to contemporary American art by living artists. Over her forty-year career, Halpert showcased such modern art luminaries as [[Elie Nadelman]], [[Max Weber (artist)|Max Weber]], [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite]] and [[William Zorach]], [[Stuart Davis (painter)|Stuart Davis]], [[Peggy Bacon]], [[Charles Sheeler]], [[Marsden Hartley]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Ben Shahn]], [[Jack Levine]], [[William Steig]], [[Jacob Lawrence]], Walter Meigs, [[Arthur Dove]], [[John Marin]], [[Georgia O'Keeffe]], and many others. Halpert later expanded her business to include American folk art, and certain nineteenth-century American painters, including [[Raphaelle Peale]], [[William Harnett|William Michael Harnett]], and [[John F. Peto|John Frederick Peto]], whom she considered to be precursors to American modernism.&lt;ref name="pollack"&gt;Pollock, Lindsay, ''The Girl With the Gallery: Edith Gregor Halpert And the Making of the Modern Art Market'', PublicAffairs, 2006. {{ISBN|978-1-58648-302-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although she arrived in the U.S. as a Russian Jewish immigrant of modest means, Halpert transformed the landscape of American art, and died a multimillionaire at the age of 70. [[Sotheby's]] credits her with putting American modern art auctions on the map with the posthumous sale of her personal collection for $3.6 million in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Pollock, p. 383, 384.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldstein"&gt;Goldstein, Malcolm, ''Landscape with Figures: A History of Art Dealing in the United States'', Oxford University Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-19-513673-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Halpert was born Edith Gregoryevna Fivoosiovitch to Gregor and Frances Lucom Fivoosiovitch in [[Odessa]] (then [[Russia]], now [[Ukraine]]) on April 25, 1900. She had a sister, Sonia, five years older. Shortly after the deadly [[Odessa pogroms#1905 Pogrom|pogroms of October 1905]], Edith emigrated to New York City in 1906 with her mother and sister (her father died in 1904 of [[tuberculosis]]).&lt;ref name="Lindsay. 2006"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70668720|title=The girl with the gallery : Edith Gregor Halpert and the making of the modern art market|last=Lindsay.|first=Pollock,|date=2006|publisher=Public Affairs|isbn=9781586483029|edition= 1st|location=New York|oclc=70668720}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time the family name changed to Fivisovitch.&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; They initially settled on the west side of [[Harlem]], then a predominantly Jewish immigrant neighborhood, and Edith attended the progressive [[Wadleigh High School for Girls]].&lt;ref name="Lindsay. 2006"/&gt; At 14, she further Americanized her name to Edith Georgina Fein and began to pursue a career as an artist. She studied drawing under [[Leon Kroll]] and [[Ivan Olinsky]] at the [[National Academy of Design]] and life drawing with [[George Bridgman|George Bridgeman]] at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]].&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; She was also a member of the [[Whitney Museum of American Art#History|Whitney Studio Club]] and [[John Weischel]]'s [[People's Art Guild]], a radical artists' cooperative for which she served as treasurer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Archino|first=Sarah|date=2013-09-01|title=The People’s Art Guild and the Forward Exhibition of 1917|url=https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/674925|journal=American Art|volume=27|issue=3|pages=14–19|doi=10.1086/674925|issn=1073-9300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, she met the American painter [[Samuel Halpert]] through the People's Art Guild, and they married the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Samuel Halpert: Art and Life 1884-1930|last=Tepfer|first=Diane|publisher=Millenium Partners|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; The couple remained in New York City, where Samuel continued to paint while Edith worked to support them. In 1925, they lived at the Maison Watteau in Montparnasse, then Paris's liveliest artist community. The following summer the Halperts stayed at the artist colony founded by [[Hamilton Easter Field]] in [[Ogunquit]], [[Maine]]. They rented a cottage from [[Robert Laurent]], and mingled with other American artists who were residing there that summer: [[Stefan Hirsch]], [[Bernard Karfiol]], [[Walt Kuhn]], [[Yasuo Kuniyoshi]], [[Katherine Schmidt]], [[Niles Spencer]], and [[Marguerite Zorach|Marguerite]] and [[William Zorach]], all of whom would later join her gallery.&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; Many of the artists in Ogunquit were interested in folk art and used it to decorate their homes and as inspiration in their work.

Samuel and Edith Halpert divorced in 1930, just before his untimely death caused by streptococci [[meningitis]].&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt;

== Business career ==
In order to support herself and her mother (and later, her husband), Halpert took a number of jobs in rapid succession and became a highly successful businesswoman. At 16 she worked at [[Bloomingdale's]] department store, first as a [[comptometer]] operator and then as an illustrator in the advertising department. She then worked in the foreign office of [[Macy's]] before becoming an advertising manager at [[Stern Brothers]]. She then switched careers, working as an efficiency expert for the garment manufacturers Cohen-Goldman and Fishman &amp; Co. Between 1920 and 1925, Halpert served in a number of capacities with S.W. Straus &amp; Company, the bank investment firm that originated real-estate mortgage bonds. By the age of 25, she was earning a substantial salary and had been appointed to the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/34642572|title=Money of the mind : borrowing and lending in America from the Civil War to Michael Milken|last=James.|first=Grant,|date=1994|publisher=Noonday Press|isbn=9780374524012|edition= 1st Noonday Press|location=New York|oclc=34642572}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AAAFA" /&gt; Despite her high status as one of the few leading female executives of her day, she quit her association with Straus at her husband's urging in 1925.&lt;ref name="pollack" /&gt; This left her with more time to devote to her marriage and gave her an opportunity to refocus her ambitions on the business of art.

==Opening The Downtown Gallery==
After a successful rise in the business world, Halpert used money from bonuses to open Our Gallery at 113 West 13th Street with her friend Berthe Kroll Goldsmith in November 1926. The gallery featured contemporary American art, often by friends of Halpert and her husband, artist [[Samuel Halpert]]. The following year, the name of the gallery changed to the '''Downtown Gallery''' (a suggestion of [[William Zorach]])&lt;ref name="AAAFA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aaa.si.edu/files/resources/finding-aids/pdf/downgall.pdf|title=A Finding Aid to the Downtown Gallery Records,1824-1974, bulk 1926-1969, in the Archives of American Art|last=Stover Gaines|first=Catherine|date=|website=|publisher=Archives of American Art, Smithsonian Institution|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early brochures, Halpert and Goldsmith described their mission thus: "The Downtown Gallery has no prejudice for any one school. Its selection is driven by quality--by what is enduring--not by what is in vogue."&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==The Downtown Gallery, American Folk Art Gallery, and The Daylight Gallery==
The [[American Folk Art Gallery]], founded by [[Holger Cahill]] in partnership with Halpert and Goldsmith, opened in 1929 as the first folk art gallery, moving in upstairs from the Downtown Gallery. The affinity between Halpert's artists and folk art was strong and sales of folk art sustained the Downtown Gallery through the Depression. ([[Abby Aldrich Rockefeller]] was a consistent buyer.) A third space opened in 1930, the Daylight Gallery, was run behind the main gallery and emphasized art and sculpture displayed in diffuse natural light.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==Fortifying The Downtown Gallery==
Halpert's business skills helped her manage prices to encourage buying by collectors of modest means. She also used marketing and advertising and worked to get her artists included in museums and public collections to increase their exposure. In an attempt to fortify the gallery, after buying out Goldsmith in 1935, Halpert winnowed her artist roster down to twelve and focused her efforts on profitability. In 1940, the gallery relocated to 43 East 51st Street and again to 32 East 51st Street in 1945.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

As an advisor for the [[WPA Federal Art Project]], Halpert had access to many non-New York based artists, who she brought to her gallery. She also worked to attract artists formerly represented by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] who died in 1946. Additionally, she took on artist estates such as [[Arthur Dove]] (a former Stieglitz artist). All of these artists added after 1936 were eventually transferred, without the artists' consent, to the Alan Gallery, led by Halpert's assistant director Charles Alan. The Downtown Gallery relocated one last time to the Ritz Tower Concourse at 465 Park Avenue in 1965.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

==Contributions to the art world==
Halpert served as organizer and director of the [[First Municipal Exhibition of American Art]], Atlantic City, New Jersey, in 1929. Her work with the [[WPA Federal Art Project]] took her to Washington D.C. in the summer of 1936 to develop the Exhibition and Allocation Program, which facilitated nationwide circulation for works from regional art centers. In 1937, she formed the Bureau for Architectural Sculpture and Murals, a central clearing-house from which architects could review and select work by artists and sculptors experienced in working in architectural settings (similar in mission to her Daylight Gallery). Halpert served as curator of the art section of the American National Exhibition, sponsored by the [[United States Information Agency]] and the [[U.S. Department of Commerce]]; she traveled to the Soviet Union with the exhibition, installed the show, and gave daily gallery talks in Russian.

In 1952, to promote art history, Halpert established the Edith Gregor Halpert Foundation. Its activities included assisting universities to fund scholarships for the study of contemporary American art and championing the rights of artists to control the sale and reproduction of their work. In recognition of her dedication to the arts, Halpert received the Art in America Award in 1959, a [[USIA]] Citation for Distinguished Service in 1960, and the First Annual International Silver Prize from the [[University of Connecticut]] for "distinguished contribution to the arts" in 1968.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

Halpert was an avid collector. Exhibitions drawn from her collection include: ''American Modernism: The First Wave, Painting from 1903-1933'', presented at [[Brandeis University]] Museum of Art, 1963; ''Six Decades of American Art'', shown at [[Leicester Galleries]], London, 1965; ''Image to Abstraction'', held at [[Amon Carter Museum]], 1967; and ''Edith Halpert and the Downtown Gallery'', exhibited at the [[University of Connecticut]], 1968. The Edith Gregor Halpert Collection was eventually sold at auction by Sotheby Parke-Bernet, 1973.&lt;ref name=AAAFA /&gt;

'''''Equal-Parallel/Guernica-Bengasi''''' is a [[sculpture]] created by American artist [[Richard Serra]]. Originally created in 1986 for the [[Reina Sofia Museum]], the sculpture was put into storage in 1988. In 2006, the museum admitted that they had lost the sculpture and had no idea where it was. Serra created a replicate sculpture which is currently on display in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.museoreinasofia.es/en/collection/artwork/equal-parallel-guernica-bengasi|title=Equal-Parallel: Guernica-Bengasi |website=museoreinasofia.es |publisher=Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The sculpture was commissioned by the [[Reina Sofia Museum]] for the exhibition 'Referencias: Un encuentro artístico en el tiempo' (''References: An artistic encounter in time''), which took place between 26 May-15 September 1986.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4626502.stm|title= Madrid 'mislays' Serra sculpture|date=19 January 2006 |website= bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC News |access-date=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EM"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 January 2006 |title=El Reina Sofía ha 'perdido' una escultura de 38 toneladas que dejó en depósito hace 14 años | url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/01/18/cultura/1137601181.html |work=El Mundo |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serra was paid $200,000 for the art work, which weighed 38 tonnes.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; In March 1988, the sculpture was placed into storage with the company Fluiters S.A., who specialized in the storage of works of art. In November 1990, the sculpture was taken out of storage and placed back on display briefly. On 25 November 1990 the sculpture was placed back into storage with the company Macarrón S.A. According to museum documentation, the sculpture was still in the storage through the year 1992.

In October 2005, the museum director Ana Martínez de Aguilar wanted to display the sculpture and found that it could not be located.&lt;ref name="EM" /&gt; The company it had been stored with had gone into receivership in 1998 and the sculpture could not be accounted for. The [[ABC (newspaper)|Spanish newspaper ''ABC'']] speculated that the sculpture may have been sold for scrap metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Tremlett|first= Giles|date=19 January 2006 |title=Museum discovers loss of 38-tonne sculpture |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/jan/19/arts.spain|work=The Guardian |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date= 5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the museum made a deal with Serra to create a [[replica]] of the original. In 2009 the replica was reinstated in the museum and is currently exhibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=10 February 2009 |title=La escultura robada de richard serra vuelve a verse desde manana en el reina sofía en una réplica gemela |url=http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/sociedad/noticias/1025919/02/09/La-escultura-robada-de-richard-serra-vuelve-a-verse-desde-manana-en-el-reina-sofia-en-una-replica-gemela.html |work=El Economist |location=Madrid, Spain |access-date=5 December 2017|language=Spanish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Geneva Centre for Security Policy''' (GCSP) is an international foundation that was established in 1995 under [[Swiss]] law to "promote the building and maintenance of peace, security and stability". The GCSP was founded by the [[Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sports]] in cooperation with the [[Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]] as a Swiss contribution to [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP).

==Location==
[[file:Maison de la paix petals 1 and 2.jpg|thumb|180x180px|right|The Maison de la paix 2013]]
GCSP's headquarters are in [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] in the [[maison de la paix]] building (the ''house of peace''), which is owned by the [[Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The "Maison de la paix" |url=http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/about-us/campus_paix/maison_paix.html |publisher=The Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies |accessdate=18 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019120926/http://graduateinstitute.ch/home/about-us/campus_paix/maison_paix.html |archivedate=19 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It shares the building with the Graduate Institute, the [[Geneva International Centre for Humanitarian Demining]] (GICHD), and the [[Geneva Centre for the Democratic Control of Armed Forces]] (DCAF). It is the main element of the ''campus de la paix'' (the ''campus of peace'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dufour|first=Nicolas|title=La Maison de la paix, "une effervescence pour Genève"|url=http://www.letemps.ch/Page/Uuid/d36202b4-25fe-11e3-ad2a-8501617392fc/La_Maison_de_la_paix_une_effervescence_pour_Gen%C3%A8ve#.UmFAr5QpZMU|accessdate=18 October 2013|newspaper=Le Temps|date=26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
GCSP's core activity is the provision of executive education and training in comprehensive international peace and security policy for mid-career [[diplomat]]s, [[military officer]]s, and [[civil servants]] from foreign, defence, and other relevant ministries, as well as from [[international organisation]]s. Participants in GCSP courses come from countries of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]], [[NATO]]'s [[Mediterranean Dialogue]], the [[Istanbul Cooperation Initiative]], and beyond, including South and East Asia and Africa. In addition to its three long-term courses (each lasting from three to nine months) offered in [[Geneva]], the GCSP also offers tailor-made courses in Geneva, [[New York City]], [[Dakar]], [[Amman]], [[Baku]], [[Addis Ababa]], [[Yerevan]] and [[Sarajevo]].

GCSP's work focuses on [[regional development]], emerging [[security]] challenges, [[leadership]], and crisis and conflict management.

==Governance and funding==
[[File:Katrin Göring-Eckardt, Francois Heisbourg (cropped).jpg|thumb|Francois Heisbourg 2015]]
The GCSP's governing body is the Foundation Council, which consists of representatives of 48 member states and the Canton of Geneva. The chairman of the Foundation Council is [[François Heisbourg]]. The director of the GCSP is [[Christian Dussey]].

The Swiss government is the principal contributor to GCSP's budget. Other council members, partner states, and institutions also support the GCSP by seconding faculty, funding scholarships, and contributing to other aspects of the centre's activities.

{{Original research|date=March 2010}}
A '''happy ending''' is an ending of the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] of a work of [[fiction]] in which almost everything turns out for the best for the [[protagonists]], their [[sidekick]]s, and almost everyone except the [[villain]]s.

In storylines where the protagonists are in physical [[Risk|danger]], a happy ending mainly consists of their survival and successful completion of the [[quest]] or mission; where there is no physical danger, a happy ending may be lovers [[Consummation|consummating]] their love despite various factors which may have thwarted it. A considerable number of storylines combine both situations. In [[Steven Spielberg]]'s version of "[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]", the happy ending consists of three distinct elements: The protagonists all survive the countless perils of their journey; humanity as a whole survives the alien invasion; ''and'' the protagonist father regains the respect of his estranged children. The plot is so constructed that all three are needed for the audience's feeling of satisfaction in the end. 

A happy ending is epitomized in the standard [[fairy tale]] ending phrase, "'''happily ever after'''" or "and they lived happily ever after". (''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' has the more restrained formula "they lived happily until there came to them the One who Destroys all Happiness" (i.e. Death); likewise, the Russian versions of fairy tales typically end with "they lived long and happily, and died together on the same day".) Satisfactory happy endings are happy for the reader as well, in that the characters he or she sympathizes with are rewarded. However, this can also serve as an open path for a possible sequel. For example, in the 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', [[Luke Skywalker]] defeats the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]] by destroying the [[Death Star]]; however, the story's happy ending has consequences that follow in ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]''. The concept of a permanent happy ending is specifically brought up in the [[Stephen King]] fantasy/fairy tale novel ''[[The Eyes of the Dragon]]'' which has a standard good ending for the genre, but simply states that "there were good days and bad days" afterwards.

==Features==
A happy ending only requires that the main characters be all right. Millions of innocent background characters can die, but as long as the characters that the reader/viewer/audience cares about survive, it can still be a happy ending. [[Roger Ebert]] comments in his review of [[Roland Emmerich]]'s ''[[The Day After Tomorrow]]'': "Billions of people may have died, but at least the major characters have survived. Los Angeles is leveled by multiple tornadoes, New York is buried under ice and snow, the United Kingdom is flash-frozen, and lots of the Northern Hemisphere is wiped out for good measure. Thank god that Jack, Sam, Laura, Jason and Dr. Lucy Hall survive, along with Dr. Hall's little [[cancer]] patient."&lt;ref&gt;[http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040528/REVIEWS/405280303/1023 Ebert's review of ''The Day After Tomorrow'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===William Shakespeare===
The presence of a happy ending is one of the key points that distinguish [[melodrama]] from [[tragedy]].  In certain periods, the endings of traditional tragedies such as ''[[Macbeth]]'' or ''[[Oedipus Rex]]'', in which most of the major characters end up dead, disfigured, or discountenanced, have been actively disliked.  In the Seventeenth Century, the Irish author [[Nahum Tate]] sought to improve [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[King Lear]]'' in [[The History of King Lear|his own heavily modified version]] in which Lear survives and Cordelia marries Edgar. Tate's version dominated performances for a century and a half, Shakespeare's original nearly forgotten. Both [[David Garrick]] and [[John Philip Kemble]], while taking up some of Shakespeare's original text, kept Tate's happy ending. [[Edmund Kean]] played ''King Lear'' with its tragic ending in 1823, but failed and reverted to Tate's crowd-pleaser after only three performances. Only in 1838 did [[William Macready]] at Covent Garden successfully restore Shakespeare's original tragic end – [[Helena Faucit|Helen Faucit]]'s final appearance as Cordelia, dead in her father's arms, became one of the most iconic of Victorian images and the play's tragic end was finally accepted by the general public. Most subsequent critics have not found Tate's amendments an improvement, and welcomed the restoration of Shakespeare's original. Happy endings have also been fastened – equally, with no lasting success – to ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' and ''[[Othello]]''. 

There is no universally accepted definition of what a happy ending is; such definitions can considerably vary with time and cultural differences. An interpretation of ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]''{{'}}s forced conversion of [[Shylock]] to Christianity is that it was intended as a happy ending. As a Christian, Shylock could no longer impose interest, undoing his schemes in the play and ending the rivalry between him and Antonio, but more important, contemporary audiences would see becoming a Christian as a means to save his soul (cf. [[Epistle to the Romans|Romans]] 11:15). In later times, Jews (and non-Jewish opponents of anti-Semitism) strongly objected to that ending, regarding it as depicting a victory for injustice and oppression and as pandering to the audience's prejudices.

===Don Juan===

Most interpretations of the [[legend]] of [[Don Juan]] end with the protagonist [[Rake (stock character)|rake]] being dragged off to [[Hell]], in just retribution for his many sins (for example, the ending of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[Don Giovanni]]''). However, [[José Zorrilla]] - whose 1844 [[Play (theatre)|play]] ''[[Don Juan Tenorio]]'' is the version most well-known in the Spanish-speaking world - believed that a story should never end sadly, and must always have a happy ending. In Zorrilla's depiction, Don Juan is saved at the last moment from the flames of Hell by the selfless pure love of Doña Inés, a woman whom he wronged but who forgave him; she had made a deal with God to offer her own blameless soul on behalf of Don Juan's - thus redeeming Don Juan and taking him with her to [[Paradise]].

===Novels===
A ''[[The Times|Times]]'' review of ''[[The Spy Who Came in from the Cold]]'' strongly criticized [[John le Carré]] for failing to provide a happy ending, and gave unequivocal  reasons why in the reviewer's opinion (shared by many others) such an ending is needed: "''The hero must triumph over his enemies, as surely as [[Jack and the Beanstalk|Jack]] must kill the giant in the nursery tale. If the giant kills Jack, we have missed the whole point of the story.''"&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', September 13, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Bernard Shaw]] had to wage an uphill struggle against audiences, as well as some critics, persistently demanding that his "[[Pygmalion (play)#Ending|Pygmalion]]" have a happy ending, i.e. that Professor Higgins and Eliza Doolitle would ultimately get married.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, T.F. (ed.) (1997). ''George Bernard Shaw (The Critical Heritage Series).'' {{ISBN|0-415-15953-9}}, pp. 223–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"From the Point of View of A Playwright," by Bernard Shaw, collected in ''Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Some Memories of Him and His Art, Collected by Max Beerbohm'' (1919). London: Hutchinson. [https://archive.org/details/herbertbeerbohmt00beer Versions at Text Archive] [https://archive.org/about/about.php Internet Archive]&lt;!--Retrieved from http://archive.org November 2[[3, 2009.--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; To Shaw's great chagrin, [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] who presented the play in London's [[West End theatre|West End]] in 1914 had sweetened the ending and told Shaw: "My ending makes money; you ought to be grateful. Your ending is damnable; you ought to be shot."&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, Bernard, edited by Dan H. Laurence. Collected Letters vol. III: 1911–1925.&lt;/ref&gt; The irritated Shaw added a postscript essay, "'What Happened Afterwards",&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, G.B. (1916). ''Pygmalion''. New York: Brentano. [http://www.bartleby.com/138/6.html Sequel: What Happened Afterwards.] [http://www.bartleby.com/sv/welcome.html Bartleby: Great Books Online.]&lt;/ref&gt; to the 1916 print edition, for inclusion with subsequent editions, in which he explained precisely why in his view it was impossible for the story to end with Higgins and Eliza getting married. Nevertheless, audiences continued wanting a happy ending also for later adaptations such as the musical and film "[[My Fair Lady]]".

===Hollywood films===

In numerous cases, [[Hollywood]] studios adapting literary works into film added a happy ending which did not appear in the original. 
* [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel, ''[[Frankenstein]]'', ended with the deaths of [[Victor Frankenstein]] and [[Elizabeth Lavenza]]. In the [[Frankenstein (1931 film)|1931 film adaption]] they survive and  marry. 
* [[C. S. Forester]]'s 1935 novel ''[[The African Queen (novel)|The African Queen]]'' has a British couple, stranded in Africa during the [[First World War]], hatch a plot to sink a German gunboat; they make an enormous, dedicated struggle, with boundless effort and sacrifice, but at the last moment their quest ends with failure and futility. In the [[The African Queen (film)|1951 film adaptation]] they succeed, and get to see the German boat sink (just in time to save them from being hanged by the Germans). 
* [[Truman Capote]]'s [[1958 in literature|1958]] [[novella]] ''[[Breakfast at Tiffany's (novella)|Breakfast at Tiffany's]]'' ended with the main character, Holly Golightly, going her own solitary way and disappearing from the male protagonist's life. In the 1961 [[Breakfast at Tiffany's (film)| film made on its base]] she finally accepts the love he offers her and the film ends with their warmly embracing, oblivious of a pouring rain.
* [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s [[fairy tale]] ''[[The Little Mermaid]]'' ends with the protagonist mermaid making a noble sacrifice, resigned to seeing her beloved prince marrying another woman. In the 1989 [[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)| Disney adaptation]], the mermaid does get to happily marry her prince. Disney later added [[The Little Mermaid II: Return to the Sea |a sequel]], obviously impossible for the Andersen original, focused on the child born of that marriage.

The '''history of flower arrangement''' dates back to [[ancient Egyptian]] times.

== The Ancient Egyptians ==
The earliest known flower arranging dates back to ancient Egypt.  Egyptians were decorating with flowers as early as 2,500 BCE.  They regularly placed cut flowers in [[vase]]s,&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica"&gt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/210629/floral-decoration, Encyclopædia Britannica,  "Floral decoration," retrieved 15 May 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  and highly stylized arrangements were used during burials, for processions, and simply as table decorations. Illustrations of arranged flowers have been found on Egyptian carved stone reliefs and painted wall decorations.

Flowers were selected according to symbolic meaning, with emphasis on religious significance.  The [[lotus flower]] or [[Nelumbo|water lily]], for example, was considered sacred to [[Isis]] and was often included in arrangements.  Many other flowers have been found in the tombs of the ancient Egyptians, and [[garlands]] of flowers were worn by loved ones and left at the tombs.&lt;ref name="National Geographic"&gt;http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2006/06/060629-egypt-flowers.html, John Roach, National Geographic News, "Ancient Flowers Found in Egypt Coffin", 29 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  These included blue [[scilla]], poppy-flowered [[anemone]], ''[[Iris sibirica]]'', [[delphinium]], [[narcissus (plant)|narcissus]], [[palm tree]], [[papyrus]] and [[rose]].&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; Egyptian wall paintings depicting roses have been found in tombs dating from the fifth century B.C. to Cleopatra’s time&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.flowermonthclub.com/flower-history|title=History of Flowers - Fresh Flower Facts {{!}} Flower of the Month Club|work=The Fresh Cut Flower of the Month Club|access-date=2018-06-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The Ancient Greeks and Romans ==
The [[Ancient Greece|Greeks]]&lt;ref name = "Encyclopædia Britannica" /&gt; and the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] also used flowers. The ancient Greeks used flowers and herbs for adornment and decorations included in artwork. They did not often use vases, focusing instead on [[garlands]] and [[wreaths]]. They would place plant material, such as olive branches, in terracotta. The leafy branches were probably used for weddings. They also tossed petals onto floors and beds. Like the Egyptians, the Greeks and Romans had preferences for the flowers and foliage they used.

The most popular foliage used by the Greeks and the Romans were [[acorn]]s, [[oak]] leaves, [[Bay Laurel|laurel]], [[ivy]], [[bay]]{{clarify|date=August 2018}} and [[parsley]]. [[Laurel wreath]]s were presented to winners of athletic competitions in the ancient [[Olympics]]; these wreaths were also awarded to individuals winning competition in poetic meets, while in Rome they symbolized a military victory and crowned the successful commander in honor of his triumph. The garland wreath was a symbol to the Greeks of power, honor, allegiance, dedication; it was awarded in honor of athletes, poets, civic leaders, soldier, and heroes.

The preferred flowers include roses, [[hyacinths]], [[honeysuckle]], [[Violet (plant)|violets]], and [[lilies]].  Other flowers such as [[tulips]], [[Consolida|larkspur]], and [[Tagetes|marigold]]s were also selected for their shape, color, and form.

Wealth and power led the Romans and Greeks to the greater luxury in the use of flowers which, like the Egyptian, were used in religious rites. At banquets, roses were strewn on the floor to a depth of one foot, and the flowers "rained" from the ceiling. The fragrance of so many roses was almost suffocating. The Romans used the roses at many meals and because of its overwhelming fragrance it{{vague|date=February 2014}} was known as the "Hour of Rose". 

== Ancient China ==
The Chinese were making flower arrangements as far back as 207 BCE to 220 CE, in the [[Han Dynasty|Han era of ancient China]].  Flowers were an integral component of religious teaching and medicine.

Practitioners of [[Buddhist|Buddhism]], [[Taoist|Taoism]], and [[Confucian]]ism placed cut flowers on their altars, a practice which dates back to 618-906 CE.  They created paintings, carvings, and embroidered items with depictions of flowers.  The paintings can be found on vases, plates, scrolls, and silk, while carvings were done on wood, bronze, jade and ivory.

Buddhist teachings forbade the taking of a life, so religious practitioners worked sparingly when taking cuttings from plants.  Flowers and leaves that were used to make basket arrangements were selected based on their symbolic meaning.  For example, the [[bamboo]], the [[peach]] tree, and the [[pear]] tree symbolized [[longevity]].  The [[wikt:tiger lily|tiger lily]], the [[pomegranate]], and the [[orchid]] symbolized [[fertility]].  The most honored of all flowers was the [[peony]].  Considered the “king of flowers”, it symbolized wealth, good fortune, and high status.

During the period 500CE to 1453CE, the [[Byzantine Empire]] made its contribution to floral arrangements, which typically included a cone shape design.  The foliage was placed in [[chalice]]s and [[urn]]s, which were further decorated with brightly colored flowers and fruit.  Flowers commonly included in these arrangements were [[Bellis perennis|daisies]], lilies, [[cypress]], [[carnations]], and [[pine]].  Ribbons were also commonly used, and leaves and tiny flowers were set in arching lines to give an twisted effect to garlands.

== Flower arranging reaches Europe ==
Flower arranging arrived in [[Europe]] around 1000 CE, and was particularly popular in churches and monasteries where flowers and plants were used for food as well as for decoration.  As [[crusade]]rs came back from the [[Middle East]], they brought with them new and interesting plants.  As a result, European countries began experimenting with plants that were previously unknown to them.

'''MIDDLE AGES (''AD 476–1400'')'''

During this era, monks were known for having gardens with herbs and wildflowers. In the later part of the Gothic period flowers reached a more dominant role, such as flowers beginning to blossom in altar pictures, manuscripts, and paintings.

An important aspect of the monastery plan was to include a medicinal herb garden, which would “furnish the physician with the pharmaceutical products needed for his cures. A dependence on the power of herbs without reference to their Creator [God] was, however, regarded as improper for a Christian” [12]. Because God “causes herbs to grow,” their medical utility is fundamentally spiritual [13]. In addition, many plants were used by monks and Christians in general in sacred rituals and ceremonies. They often had associations appealing to spiritual bases as well as to medicinal effects.

'''RENAISSANCE(''AD 1400–1600'')'''

The flower design started in Italy and grew through Europe. Paintings of impressive floral arrangements in vases were popular. In the paintings, fruit blossoms and leaves were woven into garlands to decorate walls and vaulted ceilings, and petals were piled into baskets or strewn on the floors, streets, or allowed to float down from balconies.

'''BAROQUE ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1775'')'''

At the beginning of this period floral designs were symmetrical and oval-shaped, with asymmetric crescents and S-shapes becoming popular later on.{{when|date=February 2014}}

'''DUTCH'''–'''FLEMISH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1750'')'''

The baroque arrangements in the Dutch-Flemish style were more compact and proportioned. Their major characteristic was the variety of flowers within the bouquet.

'''FRENCH ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1600–1814'')'''

During the French Baroque period, a soft, almost fragile appeal became a major characteristic of floral design. Arrangements were asymmetrical using the C-crescent or the S-shape. In the empire period they used simple lines in triangle shapes and strong color contrast. The typical empire design would be arranged in an urn containing an abundance of large richly colored flowers.

'''GEORGIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1714–1760'')'''

The designs in this period were formal and symmetrical and often tightly arranged with a variety of flowers. Oriental design became influential due to active trading. At the end of the period the designs became more informal due to the fact that the fragrance of the flowers, which were believed to rid the air of diseases, became more important. Small, handheld arrangements called [[nosegays]] or tussie-mussies were used to carry sweet scents, and also helped mask the odors of society where bathing was often believed to be unhealthy.

'''VICTORIAN ARRANGEMENTS (''AD 1820–1901'')'''

Flowers were considered fashionable in this period. Large mass flowers were placed tightly into containers to create compact arrangements that were asymmetrical and stacked tightly. There was no definite style, but many different flowers and colours  made the arrangement look almost unplanned. The tussie-mussie bouquets were still serving to eliminate odors. At the end of this period attempts were made to set up rules for a proper arranging of flowers, which is when it became an artful skill or profession in Europe.

The [[Italian Renaissance]] helped to give an extra spark to the art of flower arranging in Europe. It was during this time period that a wide variety of arrangement styles began to develop. By the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, flower arrangements were commonplace and a wide variety of materials were used to make containers, including [[marble]], heavy [[Venetian glass]], and [[bronze]].

Flower arrangements made during this time introduced a whole new element&amp;nbsp;– the usage of tropical fruits. These arrangements also focused on creating colour contrast. Some of the popular flowers included the Lilium Candidum (or Madonna Lily, used as a symbol for fertility and chastity), narcissus, pinks, iris, [[jasmine]], [[pansies]], French marigolds, [[cornflowers]], and [[rosemary]].

'''Ibn Zafar al Siqilli''', ({{lang-ar|ابن ظفر الصقلي}}), or ({{lang-ar|احجة الدين أبو عبد الله محمد بن أبي محمد بن محمد بن ظفر الصقلي}}), or '''Abū ‘Abd Allāh Muḥammad Ibn Abī Muḥammad Ibn Ẓafar al-Siqillī al-Makkī al-Mālikī''' (are among the several variants), was a [[philosopher]], [[polymath]] and Arab-Sicilian politician of the [[Normans|Norman]] period (1104 - 1170), and has come to be known in the West as "[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s Arab Precursor".

==Biography==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to be physically small and frail. His [[demonym]] 'al-Siqillī' indicates he was born in [[Sicily]], but the [[patronym]] 'al-Makkī' suggests his family origins were in [[Mecca]], where he is believed to have been raised and educated. Nicknamed 'The Wanderer', the precise chronology of his travels are uncertain.  He probably spent his youth in [[Fatimid Egypt]] and [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]], but left there in 1148 when it fell to the Normans. After a period in Sicily, Ibn Ẓafar first went to Egypt, then to [[Aleppo]] in 1146, where he taught at the [[Madrasa]] Ibn Abī ‘Aṣrūn under the patronage of Ṣāfīal-Dīn. In 1154 he returned to Sicily under the patronage of Amīr Abū ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Abī al-Qāsim Ibn ‘Alī al-Qurashī, known as Ibn Hajar, a Sicilian Arab noble, who served as a general in the Norman army. Due to the civil unrest of the Muslim population some time later, Ibn Ẓafar left Sicily definitively and took refuge in [[Hamat]], in Syria, where he died in poverty in 1170, or 1172. The geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt al-Rūmī]] referred to him as a ‘refined [[philologist]]’, and both [[Al-Dhahabi|Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī]] and [[Ibn Khallikan|Ibn Khallikān]] praised his scholarship and thought.&lt;ref name="MAB"&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13530190020000493 R. Hrair Dekmejian  &amp;  Adel Fathy Thabit  ''Machiavelli’s Arab Precursor: Ibn Zafar al-Siqillī'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ia801900.us.archive.org/5/items/WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan/Vol4Of4WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan.pdf Khallikan, ''Obituaries of Eminent Men              '', Vol.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to have authored 32 books&lt;ref&gt;Arié, Miniatures pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solwan, or Waters of Comfort===
''Sulwān al-Muṭā fī Udwān al-Atbā'' ({{lang-ar|سلوان المطاع في عدوان الأتباع}}) (Consolation for the Ruler During the Hostility of his Subjects) is his magnum opus.&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt; When [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], the famous Florentine, dedicated his treatise, '[[The Prince]]', to [[Lorenzo di Medici]] four centuries later, Ibn Ẓafar was almost unknown to the [[Western world]].  He remained in relative obscurity even after [[Michele Amari]]'s [[Italian language|Italian]] translation appeared in 1851.  Amari's introduction had included a biographical account of Ibn Ẓafar and his manuscript's history, and Richard Bentley published an English version in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof01ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof02ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt;  At the beginning of the 20th century another Sicilian and political scientist philosopher, [[Gaetano Mosca]], wrote of the striking parallels between Ibn Ẓafar's treatise and Machiavelli's.  Ibn Ẓafar's name is rarely credited as the precursor to its famous successor.

The treatise is a form  of [[Wisdom literature]] with a long Arabian and Persian tradition, called '[[Mirrors for princes]]', which purported to be handbooks for princes and caliphs offering counsel on the proper use of power, good governance and the conduct of commerce and trade.   Ibn Ẓafar dedicated the first edition of 'Sulwan' to an unknown king facing revolt - possibly the ruler of [[Damascus]] expelled by [[Nur Eddin]] - and the second edition to his patron Abū al-Qāsim (Ibn Hajar).

== Localities ==

=== Sami ===

This holds e. g. for [[Noaidi|shamanism among Sami groups]]. Some of their shamanistic beliefs and practice shared important features with [[Shamanism in Siberia|those of some Siberian cultures]].&lt;ref name=samsib&gt;Voigt 1966: 296&lt;/ref&gt; Some of their [[yoik]]s were sung on shamanistic rites,&lt;ref name=shamyoik&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 56, 76&lt;/ref&gt; this memory is conserved also in a folklore text (a shaman story).&lt;ref name=swap&gt;Voigt 1966: 145&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, yoiks are sung in two different styles, one of these are sung only by young people. But the traditional one may be the other, the “mumbling” style, resembling to magic spells.&lt;ref name=spell&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surprising characteristics of yoiks can be explained by comparing the music [[Ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, as observed in yoiks and contrasted to music ideals of other cultures. Some yoiks intend to mimic natural sounds.&lt;ref name=ykt&gt;[https://archive.is/20080325110925/http://www.uit.no/ssweb/dok/Somby/Ande/95.htm Somby 1995] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=yoikbel/&gt; This  can be contrasted to [[bel canto]], which intends to exploit human speech organs on the highest level to achieve an almost “superhuman” sound.&lt;ref name=yoikbel&gt;Szomjas-Schiffert 1996: 74&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Siberia ===

[[Shamanism in Siberia]] is far from being homogeneous. In some of the various cultures there, mimicking natural sounds can be present: some instances of [[overtone singing]], and also certain shamanic songs of some cultures can be examples.

==== Samoyedic ====

The seance of [[Nganasan people|Nganasan]] shamans were accompanied by women imitating the sounds of the reindeer calf, (thought to provide fertility for those women).&lt;ref name=calf&gt;Hoppál 2005: 92&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, A. Popov observed the Nganasan shaman Dyukhade Kosterkin imitating the sound of polar bear: the shaman was believed to have transformed into a polar bear.&lt;ref name=bear&gt;[http://haldjas.folklore.ee/~aado/tent.htm Lintrop]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Obi-Ugric ====

A Russian traveler described a [[Khanty people|Khanty]] shamanic séance: it took place in the [[birch bark]] tent in full darkness. Only the song and the [[dombra]] music of the shaman could be heard: he invoked his spirits. It was mimicked as if the direction of the sound were moving: it sounded as if the shaman had flown around in the tent and left. Later, the voices of various animals (cuckoo, owl, [[hoopoe]], duck, squirrel) could be heard. Then it was imitated as if the shaman had flown back into the tent, singing his song.&lt;ref&gt;Vitebsky 1996: 89&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Altai ====

Among several peoples near the [[Altai Mountains]], the new drum of a shaman must go through a special ritual. This is regarded as “making the drum alive”: the tree and the deer who gave their wood and skin for the new drum narrate their whole lives and promise to the shaman that they will serve him. The ritual itself is a [[libation]]: beer is poured onto the skin and wood of the drum, and these materials “come to life” and speak with the voice of the shaman in the name of the tree and the deer. Among the [[Tubalar]], this means literally the imitation of the behavior and the voice of the animal by the shaman.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eli01|Eliade 2001]]: 164 (= Chpt 5 discussing the symbolics of shamanic drum and costume, the subsection about the drum)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Soyots|Soyot]] shamanic song, sounds of bird and wolf are imitated to represent helping spirits of the shaman.&lt;ref name=soy&gt;Diószegi 1960: 203&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2558">The word '''indignation''' is used to describe strong displeasure at something considered unjust, offensive, insulting or unrighteous.

==History==

The term was coined in [[France]] during the 12th Century. It comes from the Latin word ''indignationem'', meaning displeasure. In [[nominative]] form, ''indignationem'' is ''indignatio''. ''Indignation'' is a noun of action from the past participle stem of ''indignari'', meaning unworthy, to be angry at, or to be displeased with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=indignation|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|work=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rhetoric==

According to Cicero’s ''De Inventione'', Book I, “indignation is a kind of speech by which the effect produced is, that great hatred is excited against a man, or dislike of some proceeding is originated.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/cicero/dnv1-4.htm|title=Cicero's De Inventione, Book I, translated by C. D. Yonge, at Peitho's Web|work=classicpersuasion.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal is for the speaker to create anger projected towards the opponent or the accused such that the speaker is seen more positively than the opponent. One of the features of ''indignatio'' is that it cannot function without a target of displeasure. To successfully employ the technique, the speaker must have a target, an audience with which the speaker identifies, and a desired reaction. If a speaker achieves a reaction from the audience in which they are displeased with his opponent, then the speaker has successfully employed ''indignation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetconcepts.wordpress.com/2011/12/06/indignatio-overview/|title=Indignatio: Overview|work=Rhetorical Devices and Concepts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aristotle==

[[Aristotle]] wrote in his Book II, Chapter 9, “indignation is the emotion most directly opposed to pity.” Aristotle also writes “Indignation is pain caused by the sight of undeserved good fortune.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.cs.uri.edu/courses/fall2007/csc305/Schedule/rhetoric/rhet29.htm|title=Aristotle's Rhetoric: Book II - Chapter 9|work=uri.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms indignation and indignatio are closely related in part by their common negative emotionality and anger. A speaker may successfully employ indignatio and the audience will feel indignation towards the opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhetoric.eserver.org/aristotle/rhet2-9.html|title=Book II - Chapter 9|work=eserver.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="941">'''The Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt (IMTAvH)''' is a [[tropical medicine]] institute at [[Cayetano Heredia University]] in [[Lima]], Peru. It was founded in 1968, under the direction of Prof. Hugo Lumbreras Cruz (1924 - 1985), a distinguished Peruvian doctor and parasitologist. His work as Director was continued by Dr. [[Humberto Guerra Allison]] and later by Dr. [[Eduardo Gotuzzo Herencia]]. The Instituto de Medicina Tropical Alexander von Humboldt has ongoing investigations in tuberculosis, leishmaniasis, malaria and HIV, both in its site in Lima and in several field sites such as Iquitos, Cuzco and La Merced.

'''Internet linguistics''' is a domain of [[linguistics]] advocated by the English linguist [[David Crystal]]. It studies new language styles and forms that have arisen under the influence of the [[Internet]] and of other [[new media]], such as [[Short Message Service]] (SMS) [[text messaging]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the beginning of [[human-computer interaction]] (HCI) leading to [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC) and Internet-mediated communication (IMC), experts{{who?|date=May 2018}} have acknowledged that linguistics has a contributing role in it, in terms of web interface and usability. Studying the emerging language on the Internet can help improve conceptual organization, translation and web usability. Such study aims to benefit both linguists and web users.&lt;ref name=" Linguistics and web usability "&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;

The study of Internet linguistics can take place through four main perspectives: [[#socp|sociolinguistics]], [[#ep|education]], [[#sp|stylistics]] and [[#ap|applied]] linguistics.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope"/&gt; Further dimensions have developed as a result of further technological advances - which include the development of the Web as [[text corpus | corpus]] and the spread and influence of the stylistic variations brought forth by the spread of the Internet, through the [[mass media]] and through [[literary works]]. In view of the increasing number of users connected to the Internet, the linguistics future of the Internet remains to be determined, as new computer-mediated technologies continue to emerge and people adapt their languages to suit these new media.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The Internet continues to play a significant role both in encouraging as well as in diverting attention away from the usage of languages.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"/&gt;

==Main perspectives==

David Crystal has identified four main perspectives for further investigation – the sociolinguistic perspective, the educational perspective, the stylistic perspective and the applied perspective.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The four perspectives are effectively interlinked and affect one another.

=== {{anchor|socp}}Sociolinguistic perspective ===
This perspective deals with how society views the impact of Internet development on languages.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The advent of the Internet has revolutionized communication in many ways; it changed the way people communicate and created new platforms with far-reaching social impact. Significant avenues include but are not limited to SMS text messaging, [[e-mails]], [[Online chat|chatgroups]], [[virtual worlds]] and the Web.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

The evolution of these new mediums of communications has raised much concern with regards to the way language is being used. According to Crystal (2005), these concerns are neither without grounds nor unseen in history – it surfaces almost always when a new technology breakthrough influences languages; as seen in the 15th century when [[printing]] was introduced, the 19th century when the [[telephone]] was invented and the 20th century when [[broadcasting]] began to penetrate our society.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

At a personal level, CMC such as SMS Text Messaging and mobile e-mailing ([[push mail]]) has greatly enhanced instantaneous communication.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; Some examples include the [[iPhone]] and the [[BlackBerry]].

In schools, it is not uncommon for educators and students to be given personalized school e-mail accounts for communication and interaction purposes.  Classroom discussions are increasingly being brought onto the Internet in the form of discussion forums. For instance, at [[Nanyang Technological University]], students engage in collaborative learning at the university’s portal – edveNTUre, where they participate in discussions on forums and online quizzes and view streaming podcasts prepared by their course instructors among others. [[iTunes U]] in 2008 began to collaborate with universities as they converted the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] music service into a store that makes available academic lectures and scholastic materials for free – they have partnered more than 600 institutions in 18 countries including [[Oxford University|Oxford]], [[Cambridge University|Cambridge]] and [[Yale University|Yale]] Universities.&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry"&gt;{{Cite news

| newspaper = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]
| date = 7 March 2008
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

These forms of academic social networking and media are slated to rise as educators from all over the world continue to seek new ways to better engage students. It is commonplace for students in [[New York University]] to interact with “guest speakers weighing in via [[Skype]], library staffs providing support via [[instant messaging]], and students accessing library resources from off campus.”&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"&gt;{{Cite news
| title = Universities Use Social Media to Connect
| first = Peter
| last = Cohen
| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/31/education/31iht-riedsoc.html?_r=1
| newspaper = [[The New York Times]]
| date = 30 March 2010
| accessdate = 2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This will affect the way language is used as students and teachers begin to use more of these CMC platforms.&lt;ref name="Universities Use Social Media to Connect"/&gt;

At a professional level, it is a common sight for companies to have their computers and laptops hooked up onto the Internet (via wired and wireless [[Internet connection]]), and for employees to have individual e-mail accounts. This greatly facilitates internal (among staffs of the company) and external (with other parties outside of one’s organization) communication. Mobile communications such as [[smart phones]] are increasingly making their way into the corporate world. For instance, in 2008, Apple announced their intention to actively step up their efforts to help companies incorporate the iPhone into their enterprise environment, facilitated by technological developments in streamlining integrated features (push e-mail, calendar and contact management) using [[ActiveSync]].&lt;ref name="iPhone takes on BlackBerry" /&gt;

In general, these new CMCs that are made possible by the Internet have altered the way people use language – there is heightened informality and consequently a growing fear of its deterioration. However, as David Crystal puts it, these should be seen positively as it reflects the power of the creativity of a language.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt;

====Themes====

The sociolinguistics of the Internet may also be examined through five interconnected themes.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"&gt;{{cite book

# [[Multilingualism]] – It looks at the prevalence and status of various languages on the Internet.
# [[Language change]] – From a sociolinguistic perspective, language change is influenced by the physical constraints of technology (e.g. typed text) and the shifting social-economic priorities such as globalization. It explores the linguistic changes over time, with emphasis on [[Internet lingo]].
# [[Conversation analysis|Conversation discourse]] – It explores the changes in patterns of social interaction and communicative practice on the Internet.
# Stylistic diffusion – It involves the study of the spread of Internet jargons and related linguistic forms into common usage. As language changes, conversation discourse and stylistic diffusion overlap with the aspect of language stylistics.
#:''See below: [[#sp|Stylistic perspective]]''
# [[Metalanguage]] and [[folk linguistics]] – It involves looking at the way these linguistic forms and changes on the Internet are labelled and discussed (e.g. impact of Internet lingo resulted in the 'death' of the apostrophe and loss of capitalization.)

==={{anchor|ep}}Educational perspective===
The educational perspective of internet linguistics examines the Internet's impact on [[formal language]] use, specifically on [[Standard English]], which in turn affects [[language education]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The rise and rapid spread of Internet use has brought about new linguistic features specific only to the Internet platform. These include, but are not limited to, an increase in the use of informal written language, inconsistency in written styles and [[Stylistics (linguistics)|stylistics]] and the use of new abbreviations in Internet chats and SMS text messaging, where constraints of technology on word count contributed to the rise of new abbreviations.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; Such [[acronyms]] exist primarily for practical reasons — to reduce the time and effort required to communicate through these mediums apart from technological limitations. Examples of common acronyms include ''[[lol]]'' (for laughing out loud; a general expression of laughter), ''[[SMS language#Common abbreviations|omg]]'' (oh my god) and ''gtg'' (got to go).&lt;ref name="The Influence of Internet on Language and Email Stress"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The educational perspective has been considerably established in the research on the Internet's impact on language education. It is an important and crucial aspect as it affects and involves the education of current and future student generations in the appropriate and timely use of informal language that arises from [[Internet usage]]. There are concerns for the growing infiltration of informal language use and incorrect word use into academic or formal situations, such as the usage of casual words like "guy" or the choice of the word "preclude" in place of "precede" in academic papers by students. There are also issues with spellings and grammar occurring at a higher frequency among students' academic works as noted by educators, with the use of abbreviations such as "u" for "you" and "2" for "to" being the most common.&lt;ref name="No LOL Matter: Cyber lingo shows up in academia"&gt;{{cite news
| url = http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003448269_student26.html

| last = Hayslett
| publisher = The Seattle Times
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linguists and professors like Eleanor Johnson suspect that widespread mistakes in writing are strongly connected to Internet usage, where educators have similarly reported new kinds of spelling and grammar mistakes in student works. There is, however, no [[scientific evidence]] to confirm the proposed connection.&lt;ref name="Experts divided over Internet changes to Language"&gt;{{cite news

| first = Rachel
| last = Abrams
| publisher = [[Voanews.com|VOANews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there are valid concerns about Internet usage and its impact on students' academic and formal writing, its severity is however enlarged by the informal nature of the new media platforms. [[Naomi Baron|Naomi S. Baron]] (2008)  argues in ''Always On'' that student writings suffer little impact from the use of Internet-mediated communication (IMC) such as internet chat, SMS text messaging and e-mail.&lt;ref name="Always On"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study in 2009 published by the [[British Psychological Society|British Journal of Developmental Psychology]] found that students who regularly texted (sent messages via SMS using a mobile phone) displayed a wider range of vocabulary and this may lead to a positive impact on their reading development.&lt;ref name="Texting improves language skill"&gt;{{cite news

| publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the use of the Internet resulted in stylistics that are not deemed appropriate in academic and formal language use, it is to be noted that Internet use may not hinder language education but instead aid it. The Internet has proven in different ways that it can provide potential benefits in enhancing language learning, especially in second or [[Foreign language teaching|foreign language learning]]. Language education through the Internet in relation to Internet linguisitics is, most significantly, applied through the communication aspect (use of e-mails, [[discussion forums]], [[Instant messaging|chat messengers]], [[blog]]s, etc.).&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"&gt;{{cite web

| work = Presentation

| last = Xie}}&lt;/ref&gt;
IMC allows for greater interaction between language learners and native speakers of the language, providing for greater error corrections and better learning opportunities of standard language, in the process allowing the picking up of specific skills such as negotiation and persuasion.&lt;ref name="Globalization and Language Education"/&gt;

==={{anchor|sp}}Stylistic perspective===
This perspective examines how the Internet and its related technologies have encouraged new and different forms of creativity in language, especially in literature.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; It looks at the Internet as a medium through which new language phenomena have arisen. This new mode of language is interesting to study because it is an amalgam of both spoken and written languages. For example, traditional writing is static compared to the dynamic nature of the new language on the Internet where words can appear in different colors and font sizes on the computer screen.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst "&gt;{{Cite news
 |last        = Cook
 |first       = Franklin

 |archivedate = 2010-02-13
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, this new mode of language also contains other elements not found in natural languages. One example is the concept of framing found in e-mails and discussion forums. In replying to e-mails, people generally use the sender’s e-mail message as a frame to write their own messages. They can choose to respond to certain parts of an e-mail message while leaving other bits out. In discussion forums, one can start a new thread and anyone regardless of their physical location can respond to the idea or thought that was set down through the Internet. This is something that is usually not found in written language.&lt;ref name=" Linguists See Internet Lingo as Cultural Catalyst"/&gt;

Future research also includes new varieties of expressions that the Internet and its various technologies are constantly producing and their effects not only on written languages but also their spoken forms.&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The communicative style of Internet language is best observed in the CMC channels below, as there are often attempts to overcome technological restraints such as transmission time lags and to re-establish social cues that are often vague in written text.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt;

====Mobile phones====
{{see also|mobile phone}}
Mobile phones (also called "cell phones") have an expressive potential beyond their basic communicative functions. This can be seen in text-messaging poetry competitions such as the one held by [[The Guardian]].&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; The 160-character limit imposed by the cell phone has motivated users to exercise their linguistic creativity to overcome them.  A similar example of new technology with character constraints is [[Twitter]], which has a 280-character limit.  There have been debates as to whether these new abbreviated forms introduced in users’ [[wikt:Special:Search/tweet|Tweet]]s are "lazy" or whether they are creative fragments of communication. Despite the ongoing debate, there is no doubt that Twitter has contributed to the linguistic landscape with new lingoes and also brought about a new dimension of communication.&lt;ref name=" From Telegraph to Twitter: The Language of the Short Form "&gt;{{Cite news

 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cell phone has also created a new literary genre – [[cell phone novels]]. A typical cell phone novel consists of several chapters which readers download in short installments. These novels are in their "raw" form as they do not go through editing processes like traditional novels. They are written in short sentences, similar to text-messaging.&lt;ref name="Thumbs Race as Japan’s Best Sellers Go Cellular"&gt;{{Cite news

| accessdate = 2010-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Authors of such novels are also able to receive feedbacks and new ideas from their readers through e-mails or online feedback channels. Unlike traditional novel writing, readers’ ideas sometimes get incorporated into the storyline or authors may also decide to change their story’s plot according to the demand and popularity of their novel (typically gauged by the number of download hits).&lt;ref name="Cell Phones Put to Novel Use"&gt;{{cite news

====Blogs====
{{see also|blog}}

Blogging has brought about new ways of writing diaries and from a linguistic perspective, the language used in blogs is "in its most 'naked' form",&lt;ref name="The scope of Internet Linguistics" /&gt; published for the world to see without undergoing the formal editing process. This is what makes blogs stand out because almost all other forms of printed language have gone through some form of editing and standardization.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"&gt;{{cite book |last=Crystal |first=David
|title = Language and the Internet

These developments in interactive blogging have created new linguistic conventions and styles, with more expected to arise in the future.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

====Virtual worlds====
{{see also|virtual worlds}}

Virtual worlds provide insights into how users are adapting the usage of natural language for communication within these new mediums. The Internet language that has arisen through user interactions in text-based chatrooms and [[computer-simulated]] worlds has led to the development of slangs within digital communities. Examples of these include [[pwn]] and [[noob]].

Communication in niches such as [[role-playing game]]s (RPG) of [[MUDs|Multi-User domains]] (MUDs) and virtual worlds is highly interactive, with emphasis on speed, brevity and spontaneity.  As a result, CMC is generally more vibrant, volatile, unstructured and open. There are often complex organization of sequences and exchange structures evident in the connection of conversational strands and short turns. Some of the CMC strategies used include capitalization for words such as ''EMPHASIS'', usage of symbols such as the asterisk to enclose words as seen in ''*stress*'' and the creative use of punctuation like ''???!?!?!?''.&lt;ref name="Thurlow"/&gt; Symbols are also used for discourse functions, such as the asterisk as a [[Conversation analysis#Repair|conversational repair]] marker and arrows and carats as [[deixis]] and [[referent]] markers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren B.|date=2012-03-01|title=The discourse deictics ∧ and &lt;-- in a World of Warcraft community|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211695812000050|journal=Discourse, Context &amp; Media|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–19|doi=10.1016/j.dcm.2012.05.002|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/17348/|archive-date=21 Feb 2013}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collister|first=Lauren Brittany|date=2011-02-01|title=*-repair in Online Discourse|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378216610003152|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|series=The Language of Space and Time|volume=43|issue=3|pages=918–921|doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.09.025|archive-url=http://d-scholarship.pitt.edu/20621/|archive-date=21 Feb 2014}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides contributing to these new forms in language, virtual worlds are also being used to teach languages. [[Virtual world language learning]] provides students with simulations of real-life environments, allowing them to find creative ways to improve their language skills. Virtual worlds are good tools for language learning among the younger learners because they already see such places as a "natural place to learn and play".&lt;ref name=" Language Teaching Gains Second Life: Virtual Worlds Offer New Methods to Teach Languages "&gt;{{Cite press release

====E-mail====
{{See also|email}}

One of the most popular Internet-related technologies to be studied under this perspective is e-mail, which has expanded the stylistics of languages in many ways. A study done on the linguistic profile of e-mails has shown that there is a hybrid of speech and writing styles in terms of format, grammar and style.&lt;ref name="baron"&gt;{{cite journal

| accessdate = 2010-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is often related to informality as it feels temporary and can be deleted easily. However, as this medium of communication matures, e-mail is no longer confined to sending informal messages between friends and relatives. Instead, business correspondences are increasingly being carried out through e-mails. Job seekers are also using e-mails to send their resumes to potential employers. The result of a move towards more formal usages will be a medium representing a range of formal and informal stylistics.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

While e-mail has been blamed for students’ increased usage of informal language in their written work, David Crystal argues that e-mail is "not a threat, for language education" because e-mail with its array of stylistic expressiveness can act as a domain for language learners to make their own linguistic choices responsibly. Furthermore, the younger generation’s high propensity for using e-mail may improve their writing and communication skills because of the efforts they are making to formulate their thoughts and ideas, albeit through a digital medium.&lt;ref name=" Say so long to traditional letter writing "/&gt;

====Instant messaging====
{{See also|instant messaging}}

Like other forms of online communication, instant messaging has also developed its own acronyms and short forms. However, instant messaging is quite different from e-mail and chatgroups because it allows participants to interact with one another in real-time while conversing in private.&lt;ref name="7 things you should know about…Instant Messaging "&gt;{{Cite journal

This increased degree of intimacy allows greater informality in language and "typographical idiosyncrasies". There are also greater occurrences of stylistic variation because there can be a very wide age gap between participants. For example, a granddaughter can catch up with her grandmother through instant messaging. Unlike chatgroups where participants come together with shared interests, there is no pressure to conform in language here.&lt;ref name="Language and the Internet"/&gt;

==={{anchor|ap}}Applied perspective===
[[File:Language on internet.JPG|thumb|alt=|Source: [http://www.internetworldstats.com/stats7.htm Internet World Stats]]]
The applied perspective views the linguistic exploitation of the Internet in terms of its communicative capabilities – the good and the bad.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; The Internet provides a platform where users can experience multilingualism. Although English is still the dominant language used on the Internet, other languages are gradually increasing in their number of users.&lt;ref name="Thurlow" /&gt; The [[Global Internet usage]] page provides some information on the number of users of the Internet by language, nationality and geography. This multilingual environment continues to increase in diversity as more language communities become connected to the Internet. The Internet is thus a platform where minority and [[endangered language]]s can seek to revive their language use and/or create awareness. This can be seen in two instances where it provides these languages opportunities for progress in two important regards - [[language documentation]] and [[language revitalization]].&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

====Language documentation====
{{See also|Language documentation}}
Firstly, the Internet facilitates language documentation. Digital archives of media such as audio and video recordings not only help to preserve language documentation, but also allows for global dissemination through the Internet.&lt;ref name="Johnson"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publicity about endangered languages, such as Webster (2003) has helped to spur a worldwide interest in linguistic documentation.

Foundations such as the Hans Rausing Endangered Languages Project (HRELP), funded by Arcadia also help to develop the interest in linguistic documentation. The HRELP is a project that seeks to document endangered languages, preserve and disseminate documentation materials among others. The materials gathered are made available online under its Endangered Languages Archive (ELAR) program.

Other online materials that support language documentation include the Language Archive Newsletter which provides news and articles about topics in endangered languages. The web version of Ethnologue also provides brief information of all of the world’s known living languages. By making resources and information of endangered languages and language documentation available on the Internet, it allows researchers to build on these materials and hence preserve endangered languages.

====Language revitalization====
{{See also|language revitalization}}

Secondly, the Internet facilitates language revitalization. Throughout the years, the digital environment has developed in various sophisticated ways that allow for virtual contact. From e-mails, chats to instant messaging, these virtual environments have helped to bridge the spatial distance between communicators. The use of e-mails has been adopted in language courses to encourage students to communicate in various styles such as conference-type formats and also to generate discussions.&lt;ref name="Singhal"&gt;{{cite journal

| first = Meena
| last = Singhal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the use of e-mails facilitates language revitalization in the sense that speakers of a minority language who moved to a location where their native language is not being spoken can take advantage of the Internet to communicate with their family and friends, thus maintaining the use of their native language. With the development and increasing use of telephone broadband communication such as [[Skype]], language revitalization through the internet is no longer restricted to literate users.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt;

Hawaiian educators have been taking advantage of the Internet in their language revitalization programs.&lt;ref name="Warschauer"&gt;{{cite journal

The content, interface and menus of the system are entirely in the Hawaiian language. It is installed throughout the immersion school system and includes components for e-mails, chat, dictionary and online newspaper among others. In higher institutions such as colleges and universities where the Leoki system is not yet installed, the educators make use of other software and Internet tools such as Daedalus Interchange, e-mails and the Web to connect students of Hawaiian language with the broader community.&lt;ref name="Warschauer2"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another use of the Internet includes having students of minority languages write about their native cultures in their native languages for distant audiences. Also, in an attempt to preserve their language and culture, [[Occitan]] speakers have been taking advantage of the Internet to reach out to other Occitan speakers from around the world.  These methods provide reasons for using the minority languages by communicating in it.&lt;ref name="Wright"&gt;{{cite journal

====Exploitation of the Internet====
::''See also: [[Forensic linguistics]]''

The Internet can also be exploited for activities such as [[terrorism]], [[internet fraud]] and [[pedophilia]]. In recent years, there has been an increase in crimes that involved the use of the Internet such as e-mails and [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC), as it is relatively easy to remain anonymous.&lt;ref name="BAAS"&gt;{{cite news

From a forensic linguistic point of view, there are many potential areas to explore. While developing a chat room [[Content-control software|child protection procedure]] based on search terms filtering is effective, there is still minimal linguistically orientated literature to facilitate the task.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; In other areas, it is observed that the [[Semantic Web]] has been involved in tasks such as personal [[data protection]], which helps to prevent fraud.&lt;ref name="Ryan Lee"&gt;{{cite book

==Dimensions==

The dimensions covered in this section include looking at the Web as a corpus and issues of language identification and normalization. The impacts of internet linguistics on everyday life are examined under the spread and influence of Internet stylistics, trends of language change on the Internet and conversation discourse.

===The Web as a corpus===

With the Web being a huge reservoir of data and resources, language scientists and technologists are increasingly turning to the web for language data.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"&gt;{{Cite journal

It was met with much controversy as they lacked theoretical integrity leading to much skepticism of their role in the field,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; until the publication of the journal ‘Using Large Corpora’ in 1993&lt;ref name="computational linguistics using large corpora"&gt;{{Cite journal

====Themes====

There has been much discussion about the possible developments in the arena of the Web as a corpus. The development of using the web as a data source for word sense disambiguation was brought forward in The EU MEANING project in 2002.&lt;ref name="rigau000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of [[language modeling]], the Web has been used to address data sparseness. Lexical statistics have been gathered for resolving prepositional phrase attachments,&lt;ref name="volk000"&gt;{{Cite conference

In areas of information retrieval, a Web track was integrated as a component in the community’s TREC evaluation initiative. The sample of the Web used for this exercise amount to around 100GB, compromising of largely documents in the .gov top level domain.&lt;ref name="hawking000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====British National Corpus====
{{See also|British National Corpus}}

The [[British National Corpus]] contains ample information on the dominant meanings and usage patterns for the 10,000 words that forms the core of English.

The number of words in the British National Corpus (ca 100 million) is sufficient for many empirical strategies for learning about language for linguists and lexicographers,&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="baker001"&gt;{{Cite conference

However, for some other purposes, it is insufficient, as an outcome of the [[Zipfian distribution|Zipfian]] nature of word frequencies. Because the bulk of the lexical stock occurs less than 50 times in the British National Corpus, it is insufficient for statistically stable conclusions about such words. Furthermore, for some rarer words, rare meanings of common words, and combinations of words, no data has been found. Researchers find that probabilistic models of language based on very large quantities of data are better than ones based on estimates from smaller, cleaner data sets.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====The multilingual Web====

{{Update||date=March 2017|inaccurate=yes|talk=The data about percentage of  languages on internet pages is from year 2000 and is no longer accurate.}}

The Web is clearly a multilingual corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Ivković, D. (2013). The Eurovision Song Contest on YouTube: A corpus-based analysis of language attitudes. Language@Internet, 10, article 1. (urn:nbn:de:0009-7-35977)&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 71% of the pages (453 million out of 634 million Web pages indexed by the Excite engine) were written in English, followed by Japanese (6.8%), German (5.1%), French (1.8%), Chinese (1.5%), Spanish (1.1%), Italian (0.9%), and Swedish (0.7%).&lt;ref name="xu000"&gt;{{Cite conference

A test to find contiguous words like ‘deep breath’ revealed 868,631 Web pages containing the terms in [[AlltheWeb]]. The number found through the search engines are more than three times the counts generated by the British National Corpus, indicating the significant size of the English corpus available on the Web.

The massive size of text available on the Web can be seen in the analysis of controlled data in which corpora of different languages were mixed in various proportions. The estimated Web size in words by [[AltaVista]] saw English at the top of the list with 76,598,718,000 words. The next is German, with 7,035,850,000 words along with 6 other languages with over a billion hits. Even languages with fewer hits on the Web such as Slovenian, Croatian, Malay, and Turkish have more than one hundred million words on the Web.&lt;ref name="grenstette000"&gt;{{Cite conference

====Challenges====

In areas of language modeling, there are limitations on the applicability of any language model as the statistics for different types of text will be different.&lt;ref name="biber000"&gt;{{Cite journal
 | title = Using register-diversified corpora for general language studies
 | journal = Computational Linguistics
 | volume = 19

 | last = Biber
 | first = Douglas

 | publisher = [[MIT Press]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a language technology application is put into use (applied to a new text type), it is not certain that the language model will fare in the same way as how it would when applied to the training corpus. It is found that there are substantial variations in model performance when the training corpus changes.&lt;ref name="sekine000"&gt;{{Cite conference

  | place = Washington, DC
  | pages = 96–102
  | year = 1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of theory types limits the assessment of the usefulness of language-modeling work.

As Web texts are easily produced (in terms of cost and time) and with many different authors working on them, it often results in little concern for accuracy. Grammatical and typographical errors are regarded as “erroneous” forms that cause the Web to be a dirty corpus. Nonetheless, it may still be useful even with some noise.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The issue of whether [[sublanguage]]s should be included remains unsettled. Proponents of it argue that with all sublanguages removed, it will result in an impoverished view of language. Since language is made up of lexicons, grammar and a wide array of different sublanguages, they should be included. However, it is not until recently that it became a viable option. Striking a middle ground by including some sublanguages is contentious because it’s an arbitrary issue of which to include and which not.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

The decision of what to include in a corpus lies with corpus developers, and it has been done so with pragmatism.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt; The desiderata and criteria used for the British National Corpus serves as a good model for a general-purpose, general-language corpus&lt;ref name="atkins001"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the focus of being representative replaced with being balanced.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

Search engines such as [[Google]] serves as a default means of access to the Web and its wide array of linguistics resources. However, for linguists working in the field of corpora, there presents a number of challenges. This includes the limited instances that are presented by the search engines (1,000 or 5,000 maximum); insufficient context for each instance (Google provides a fragment of around ten words); results selected according to criteria that are distorted (from a linguistic point of view) as search term in titles and headings often occupy the top results slots; inability to allow searches to be specified according to linguistic criteria, such as the citation form for a word, or word class; unreliability of statistics, with results varying according to search engine load and many other factors. At present, in view of the conflicts of priorities among the different stakeholders, the best solution is for linguists to attempt to correct these problems by themselves. This will then lead to a large number of possibilities opening in the area of harnessing the rich potential of the Web.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

====Representation====

Despite the sheer size of the Web, it may still not be representative of all the languages and domains in the world, and neither are other corpora. However, the huge quantities of text, in numerous languages and language types on a huge range of topics makes it a good starting point that opens up to a large number of possibilities in the study of corpora.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

===Impact of its spread and influence===

Stylistics arising from Internet usage has spread beyond the new media into other areas and platforms, including but not limited to, [[films]], [[music]] and [[literary works]]. The infiltration of Internet stylistics is important as mass audiences are exposed to the works, reinforcing certain Internet specific language styles which may not be acceptable in standard or more formal forms of language.

Apart from internet slang, grammatical errors and typographical errors are features of writing on the Internet and other CMC channels. As users of the Internet gets accustomed to these errors, it progressively infiltrates into everyday language use, in both written and spoken forms.&lt;ref name="David Crystal's Scope" /&gt; It is also common to witness such errors in mass media works, from typographical errors in news articles to grammatical errors in advertisements and even internet slang in drama dialogues.

The more the internet is incorporated into daily life, the greater the impact it has on formal language. This is especially true in modern Language Arts classes through the use of smart phones, tablets, and social media. Students are exposed to the language of the internet more than ever, and as such, the grammatical structure and slang of the internet are bleeding into their formal writing. Full immersion into a language is always the best way to learn it. Mark Lester in his book ''&lt;u&gt;Teaching Grammar and Usage&lt;/u&gt;'' states, “The biggest single problem that basic writers have in developing successful strategies for coping with errors is simply their lack of exposure to formal written English...We would think it absurd to expect a student to master a foreign language without extensive exposure to it.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Teaching Grammar and Usage|last = Lester|first = Mark|publisher = Allyn and Bacon|year = 2001|isbn = 0205306551|location = Boston|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since students are immersed in internet language, that is the form and structure they are mirroring.

==== Mass media ====

There has been instances of television advertisements using Internet slang, reinforcing the penetration of Internet stylistics in everyday language use. For example, in the [[Cingular Wireless|Cingular]] commercial in the United States, acronyms such as "BFF Jill" (which means "Best Friend Forever, Jill") were used. More businesses have adopted the use of Internet slang in their advertisements as the more people are growing up using the Internet and other CMC platforms, in an attempt to relate and connect to them better.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such commercials have received relatively enthusiastic feedback from its audiences.&lt;ref name="Using Internet Slang in Spoken Conversation: LOL!"/&gt;

The use of [[Internet lingo]] has also spread into the arena of music, significantly seen in [[popular music]]. A recent example is [[Trey Songz|Trey Songz's]] lyrics for "LOL :-)", which incorporated many Internet lingo and mentions of Twitter and texting.&lt;ref name="Trey Songz LOL"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.treysongz.com/music/lol-ft-gucci-mane-soulja-boy/ | title = LOL :-) Ft. Gucci Mane &amp; Soulja Boy Tell 'Em | work = Song | first = Trey | last = Songz | authorlink = Trey Songz | publisher = Trey Songz| accessdate = 2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of Internet linguistics is also present in [[films]] made by both commercial and [[independent filmmakers]]. Though primarily screened at [[film festivals]], DVDs of independent films are often available for purchase over the internet including paid-live-streamings, making access to films more easily available for the public.&lt;ref name="LOL - The Movie"&gt;{{cite video

| accessdate = 2010-11-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very nature of commercial films being screened at public cinemas allows for the wide exposure to the mainstream mass audience, resulting in a faster and wider spread of Internet slangs. The latest commercial film is titled "LOL" (acronym for ''Laugh Out Loud'' or ''Laughing Out Loud''), starring [[Miley Cyrus]] and [[Demi Moore]].&lt;ref name="Miley Cyrus' Movie 'LOL' Picked Up By Distributor"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of internet slangs is not limited to the English language but extends to other languages as well. The [[Korean language]] has incorporated the English alphabet in the formation of its slang, while others were formed from common misspellings arising from fast typing. The new [[Korean slang]] is further reinforced and brought into everyday language use by television shows such as [[soap operas]] or comedy dramas like “[[High Kick Through the Roof]]” released in 2009.&lt;ref name="Korean Language in Contemporary Society"&gt;[[Korean Language in Contemporary Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Linguistic future of the Internet==

With the emergence of greater computer/Internet mediated communication systems, coupled with the readiness with which people adapt to meet the new demands of a more technologically sophisticated world, it is expected that users will continue to remain under pressure to alter their language use to suit the new dimensions of communication.&lt;ref name="the web as corpus"/&gt;

As the number of Internet users increase rapidly around the world, the cultural background, linguistic habits and language differences among users are brought into the Web at a much faster pace. These individual differences among Internet users are predicted to significantly impact the future of Internet linguistics, notably in the aspect of the multilingual web. As seen from 2000 to 2010, Internet penetration has experienced its greatest growth in non-English speaking countries such as China, India and Africa,&lt;ref name="Internet Usage Statistics"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Internet Usage Statistics - World Internet Users and Population Stats

Also, the interaction between English and other languages is predicted to be an important area of study.&lt;ref&gt;Ivkovic, D., &amp; Lotherington, H. (2009). Multilingualism in cyberspace: Conceptualising the virtual linguistic landscape. International Journal of Multilingualism, 6(1), 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; As global users interact with each other, possible references to different languages may continue to increase, resulting in formation of new Internet stylistics that spans across languages. Chinese and Korean languages have already experienced English language's infiltration leading to the formation of their multilingual Internet lingo.&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language"&gt;{{cite web

At current state, the Internet provides a form of education and promotion for minority languages. However, similar to how cross-language interaction has resulted in English language's infiltration into Chinese and Korean languages to form new slangs,&lt;ref name="A Comparison of English and Chinese Internet Language" /&gt; minority languages are also affected by the more common languages used on the Internet (such as English and Spanish). While language interaction can cause a loss in the authentic standard of minority languages, familiarity of the majority language can also affect the minority languages in adverse ways.&lt;ref name="Introduction to Minority Languages, Multimedia and the Web"&gt;{{cite journal

The '''''Journal of Bisexuality''''' is a [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published quarterly by the [[Taylor &amp; Francis|Taylor &amp; Francis Group]] under the [[Routledge]] imprint. It is the official journal of the [[American Institute of Bisexuality]]. It covers a wide range of topics on [[bisexuality]] including new bisexuality research, bisexual issues in therapy, differences from the straight, lesbian and gay communities, growth of the bisexual movement, bisexuality and the media, bisexual history, and different bisexual lifestyles.

In addition, the journal also publishes book and movie reviews covering bisexual lead characters from every era. Special thematic issues cover topics singularly; such as women and bisexuality — a global perspective, bisexual women in the 21st century, bisexual men in culture and society, and bisexuality in the lives of men.

The journal was established in 1999. Its first [[editor-in-chief]] was [[Fritz Klein (sex researcher)|Fritz Klein]], followed by [[Jonathan Alexander (professor)|Jonathan Alexander]], Brian Zamboni, and [[James D. Weinrich]]. In 2014, M. Paz Galupo became its first female editor-in-chief.

{{nihongo|'''Kyoto University'''|京都大学|Kyōto daigaku}}, or  {{nihongo|'''''Kyodai'''''|京大|Kyōdai}} is a [[Japanese national university|national university]] in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. It is the second oldest Japanese university,&lt;ref name="ku-sketch"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/english/euni_int/e01_eυnka/enkaku.htm |title=Historical Sketch |accessdate=2007-07-17 |date= |year=2004 |month= |work=About Kyoto University |publisher=Kyoto University |pages= |quote= }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of Asia's highest ranked universities and one of Japan's [[National Seven Universities]]. One of Asia’s leading research-oriented institutions, Kyoto University is famed for producing world-class researchers, including [[List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Kyoto University|18 Nobel Prize laureates]], [[List of Fields Medal winners by university affiliation|2 Fields medalists]] and one [[Gauss Prize]] winner. It has the [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|most Nobel laureates of all universities in Asia]].

== History ==
Kyoto University's forerunner was the {{nihongo|'''Chemistry School'''|舎密局|''Seimi-kyoku''}} founded in [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]] in 1869, which, despite its name, taught physics as well. ({{lang|ja|舎密}} is a [[transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] of a [[Dutch language|Dutch]] word [[:nl:Chemie|chemie]].) Later, the {{nihongo|'''Third Higher School'''|第三髙等學校|Daisan-kōtō-gakkō}} was established in the place of ''Seimi-kyoku'' in 1886, it then transferred to the university's present main campus in the same year.

{{nihongo|'''Kyoto Imperial University'''|京都帝國大學|Kyōto-teikoku-daigaku}} as a part of the [[National Seven Universities|Imperial University]] system was established on June 18, 1897,&lt;ref name="ku-sketch"/&gt; using the Third Higher School's buildings. The higher school moved to a patch of land across the street, where the Yoshida South Campus stands today. In the same year of the university's establishment, the College of Science and Technology was founded. The College of [[Law]] and the College of [[Medicine]] were founded in 1899, the College of Letters in 1906, expanding the university's activities to areas outside [[natural science]].

After [[World War II]], the current Kyoto University was established by merging the imperial university and the Third Higher School, which assumed the duty of teaching [[liberal arts]] as the {{nihongo|Faculty of Liberal Arts|教養部|Kyōyō-bu}}. The faculty was dissolved with the foundation of the {{nihongo|Faculty of [[Integrated Human Studies]]|総合人間学部|Sōgō-ningen-gakubu}} in 1992.

Kyoto University has since 2004 been incorporated as a national university corporation under a new law which applies to all national universities.

Despite the incorporation which has led to increased financial independence and autonomy, Kyoto University is still partly controlled by the {{nihongo|[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education]]|[[:ja:文部科学省|文部科学省]]|Monbu-kagaku-shō}}.

The University's Department of Geophysics and their [[Disaster Prevention Research Institute]] are represented on the national [[Coordinating Committee for Earthquake Prediction]].&lt;ref name=ccep-orgs&gt;[http://cais.gsi.go.jp/YOCHIREN/links.e.html#hoka Organizations with ties to CCEP] CCEP, accessed 2011-03-19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campuses ==

===Research performance===
Kyodai is usually considered as one of the top research institution in Japan. In fact, the 2nd largest amount of investment from [[:ja:科学研究費補助金|Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research]], which is the national grants program for research institutions.

This financial support from the Japanese government has a direct effect on Kyodai's research outcomes. According to [[Thomson Reuters]], Kyodai is the 1st best research university in Japan.&lt;ref name="Rankings_TR_N" /&gt; Its research excellence is especially distinctive in Chemistry (1st in Japan, 4th in the world), Biology &amp; Biochemistry (2nd in Japan, 23rd in the world), Pharmacology &amp; Toxicology (2nd in Japan,30 in the world), Immunology (3rd in Japan, 25th in the world), Material Science (4th in Japan, 22nd in the world), and Physics (4th in Japan, 25th in the world).&lt;ref name=executive&gt;{{cite web |title=Thomson Reuters 20 Top research institutions in Japan |publisher=Thomson Reuters |url=http://science.thomsonreuters.jp/press/release/2011/esi2011/ranking/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613213519/http://science.thomsonreuters.jp/press/release/2011/esi2011/ranking/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-06-13 |language=Japanese }} (this raking includes non-educational institutions)&lt;/ref&gt;

In another ranking, [[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei Shimbun]] on 2004/2/16 surveyed about the research standards in [[Engineering|Engineering studies]] based on Thomson Reuters, [[:ja:科学研究費補助金|Grants in Aid for Scientific Research]] and questionnaires to the heads of 93 leading Japanese Research Centers. Kyodai was placed in the 10th position (research planning ability 6th) in this ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage3.nifty.com/katu-kobayashi/doppo/kougaku_kennkyu.htm |title=大学工学部研究力調査（04.2.22） |publisher=Homepage3.nifty.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150507184047/http://homepage3.nifty.com/katu-kobayashi/doppo/kougaku_kennkyu.htm |archive-date=May 7, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kyodai also has a high research standard in Social Sciences &amp; Humanities. [[Repec]] in January 2011 ranked Kyodai's Institute of Economic Research as Japan's 3rd best economic research institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/top/old/1101/top.japan.html |title=Within Country and State Rankings at IDEAS: Japan |publisher=Ideas.repec.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kyodai has provided 6 presidents of the [[Japanese Economic Association]] in its 42-year history, which is the 3rd largest number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jeaweb.org/eng/AboutPresidents.html |title=Japanese Economic Association - JEA Global Site |publisher=Jeaweb.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Asahi Shimbun]] summarized the amount of academic papers in Japanese major legal journals by university, and Kyodai was ranked 6th for the period between 2005 and 2009.&lt;ref name="Rankings_ASAHI_L"/&gt;

===Graduate school rankings===
Kyodai Law School is considered as one of the top Law schools in Japan, being ranked 4th in terms of  the number of successful candidates of Japanese [[Bar Examination]] in 2009 and 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws.shikakuseek.com/data/2010data-2.html |title=2010年(平成22年)新司法試験法科大学院別合格率ランキング -法科大学院seek |publisher=Laws.shikakuseek.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eduniversal]] ranked Japanese business schools, and the Faculty of Economics in Kyodai is placed 4th in Japan (111th in the world).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eduniversal-ranking.com/business-school-university-ranking-in-japan.html |title=University and business school ranking in Japan |publisher=Eduniversal-ranking.com |date= |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alumni rankings===
Kyodai alumni are distinctively successful in Japanese industries such as shown below.

According to the [[:ja:エコノミスト (雑誌)|Weekly Economist]]'s 2010 rankings, graduates from Kyodai have the 10th best employment rate in 400 major companies in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/honkawa/3865.html|title=Employment rate in 400 major companies rankings |year=2011 |publisher=Weekly Economist |accessdate=Apr 29, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has to be noted that this lower ranking position is because of the large number of alumni who become government bureaucrats, which is 2nd largest among Japanese universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/honkawa/3866.html |title=図録▽大学ランキング：国家公務員試験合格者数 |publisher=.ttcn.ne.jp |date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, alumni of Kyodai's average salary is the 5th best in Japan, according to the [[:ja:プレジデント社|PRESIDENT]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=大学偏差値情報局 at 02:51 - TrackBack(0) - 就職に強い大学ランキング |url=http://hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net/article/26733115.html#more |title=年収偏差値・給料偏差値ランキング（2006・10・16）：稼げる大学はどれ？ |publisher=Hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2014-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mines ParisTech : Professional Ranking World Universities]] ranks Kyodai as 5th in the world in 2011 in terms of the number of alumni listed among CEOs in the 500 largest worldwide companies.&lt;ref name="Rankings_ENSMP_W" /&gt;

===Popularity and selectivity===
Kyodai is one of the most selective universities in Japan. Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as one of the top among 180 national and public universities.&lt;ref&gt;Private universities apply different kind of exams. Thus it's only comparable between universities in a same category.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [[:ja:代々木ゼミナール|Yoyogi seminar]] published Hensachi (the indication showing the entrance difficulties by prep schools) rankings {{cite web|url=http://www.yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422110816/http://yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |archivedate=April 22, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Japanese journalist [[:ja:島野清志|Kiyoshi Shimano]] ranks its entrance difficulty as SA (most selective/out of 10 scales) in Japan. {{cite book |script-title=ja:危ない大学・消える大学 2012年版 |year=2011 |publisher=YELL books |isbn=4-7539-3018-1 |language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N. Proctor]], a historian of science at Stanford University, stated that the March for Science was "pretty unprecedented in terms of the scale and breadth of the scientific community that's involved" and was rooted in "a broader perception of a massive attack on sacred notions of truth that are sacred to the scientific community."&lt;ref&gt;Chris Mooney, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2017/04/22/historians-say-the-march-for-science-is-pretty-unprecedented/ Historians say the March for Science is 'pretty unprecedented'], ''Washington Post'' (April 22, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

===International solidarity===
International sister marches were planned for countries around the world. These both supported American scientists and climate scientists more generally, and protested against other impingements on academic freedom internationally, such as government action against the [[Central European University]] in Hungary and the [[List of educational institutions closed in the 2016 Turkish purges|closure of educational institutes]] and dismissal of academics in the [[2016–17 Turkish purges]], as well as local issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/marchers-around-world-tell-us-why-theyre-taking-streets-science |title=Marchers around the world tell us why they're taking to the streets for science |date=13 April 2017 |accessdate=24 April 2017 |newspaper=Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:March for Science, Washington, DC (33825703150).jpg|thumb|Protestors march towards the Capitol Building]]
The primary march in [[Washington, D.C.]] began at 10 AM with a rally and teach-in on the grounds of the [[Washington Monument]], featuring speeches by concerned citizens alternating with scientists and engineers; including [[Denis Hayes]], co-founder of the first Earth Day in 1970 and [[Bill Nye]].&lt;ref name="planb"&gt;{{cite news|title=Why people are marching for science: ‘There is no Planet B’| author1=Joel Achenbach| author2=Ben Guarino| author3=Sarah Kaplan| date=April 22, 2017|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/big-turnout-expected-for-march-for-science-in-dc/2017/04/21/67cf7f90-237f-11e7-bb9d-8cd6118e1409_story.html|accessdate=30 April 2017|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; No politicians spoke at the rally.&lt;ref name="planb"/&gt; At 2 PM the crowd of thousands, in spite of the steady rain throughout the day, proceeded down [[Constitution Avenue]] to 3rd Street, NW between the [[National Mall]] and the west front of the [[United States Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/22/science/march-for-science.html?_r=0|author=Nicholas St. Fleur| title=Scientists, Feeling Under Siege, March Against Trump Policies| accessdate=30 April 2017|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="planb"/&gt;

[[File:Lydia Villa-Komaroff.jpg |thumb |[[Lydia Villa-Komaroff]]]]Professor [[Robert N.

===Support===
On January 26, 2017, U.S. Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of Vermont expressed his support for the march, congratulating "those scientists and researchers who are fighting back".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Firozi |first1=Paulina |title=Sanders applauds scientists 'fighting back' with planned DC march |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/316453-sanders-backs-scientists-fighting-back-with-planned-march-in-dc-science-is |work=The Hill |date=January 27, 2017 |accessdate=February 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. Representative Bill Foster of Illinois, a physicist and the only current member of Congress with a Ph.D. in a [[natural sciences]] field, will join the march, "not as a Democratic member of Congress, but as a scientist."&lt;ref name="Gacher"&gt;Lev Gacher, [https://www.statnews.com/2017/04/05/bill-foster-scientist-congress-march/ Congress's one PhD-trained scientist will join march on Washington], ''[[Stat (website)|Stat]] (April 5, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Foster said that he viewed the march as political, but not partisan, saying, "if you see a specific policy that is inconsistent with the known principles of science, every citizen who is also a scientist should speak out."&lt;ref name="Gacher"/&gt;

In February the AAAS and other science groups announced their support for the march.&lt;ref name="KaplanNye"/&gt; [[Rush Holt Jr.]], the chief executive officer of the AAAS, expressed support for scientist involvement in politics.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Holt also emphasizes the importance of "appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population".&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

{{quote|"What’s so interesting is it’s the first time, I think, anybody can point to in decades where there has been a spontaneous effort to defend the idea of science.

===Criticism===
The march received a torrent of criticism from [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] publications for the perceived [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] bias and orientation of the event.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/apr/21/march-science-comes-under-microscope-over-left-til/]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of scientists voiced concerns over the march. [[Sylvester James Gates]] warned that "such a politically charged event might send a message to the public that scientists are driven by ideology more than by evidence".&lt;ref name=BLOOMsome&gt;{{cite news |last1=Flam |first1=Faye |authorlink1=Faye Flam |title=Why Some Scientists Won't March for Science |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-07/why-some-scientists-won-t-march-for-science |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |work=[[Bloomberg View]] |date=March 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Climate change denier [[William Happer]]&lt;ref&gt;Hannah Devlin, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/feb/15/trump-science-adviser-william-happer-climate-change-cult Trump's likely science adviser calls climate scientists 'glassy-eyed cult'], ''The Guardian'', February 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; stated that "there's no reason to assume the president is against science" while regarding the march.&lt;ref name=BLOOMsome/&gt; Writing in the ''[[New York Times]]'', [[Robert S. Young]] argued that the march will "reinforce the narrative from skeptical conservatives that scientists are an interest group and politicize their data, research and findings for their own ends" and that it would be better for scientists to "march into local civic groups, churches, county fairs and, privately, into the offices of elected officials."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Young |first1=Robert S. |authorlink1=Robert S. Young |title=A Scientists' March on Washington Is a Bad Idea |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/31/opinion/a-scientists-march-on-washington-is-a-bad-idea.html |accessdate=March 8, 2017 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Matthew Nisbet writing for ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' magazine right after the first march in 2017, states that it isn't the least educated but the "best educated and most scientifically literate who are prone to biased reasoning and false beliefs about contentious science issues". In his opinion this will mean that the March will only deepen "partisan differences, while jeopardizing trust and impartiality and credibility of scientists". Regardless of assurances by the March's organizers that this would be non-political, it clearly was. Nisbet feels that confidence in scientists is strong, and they should "use this capital wisely and effectively".&lt;ref name="Nisbet 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nisbet |first1=Matthew |title=The March for Science: Partisan Protests Put Public Trust in Scientists at Risk |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=18–19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Responding to criticism surrounding the political nature of the march, meteorologist and columnist [[Eric Holthaus]] wrote that the scientific field "has always been political" and referred to the example of Galileo Galilei's [[Galileo affair|confrontation with the political order]]. Holthaus wrote that the scientists must also protest when "truth itself is being called into question".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Holthaus |first1=Eric |title=The March for Science Isn't 'Political'—It's a Defense of Basic Truth |url=https://psmag.com/the-march-for-science-isnt-political-it-s-a-defense-of-basic-truth-4aaf89ebbd4b#.lkbs4lmc6 |accessdate=March 9, 2017 |work=Pacific Standard |date=February 1, 2017 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Discussing science’s role in policy and government, Rush Holt points out a [[fallacy]] in viewing science and politics as philosophically incompatible: "The ethic in the profession is that you stick to your science, and if you’re interested in how science affects public policy or public questions, just let the facts speak for themselves. Of course, there’s a fallacy there, too. Facts are, by themselves, voiceless."&lt;ref name="Distillations"/&gt;

San Francisco Lead Organizer Kristen Ratan debated [[Jerry Coyne]] on [[KQED |KQED's]] Forum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ww2.kqed.org/forum/2017/04/20/scientists-across-the-nation-trade-in-lab-coats-for-protest-signs |title=Scientists Across the Nation Trade in Lab Coats for Protest Signs |author= |date= |work=kqed.org |accessdate=April 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.podtrac.com/pts/redirect.mp3/www.kqed.org/.stream/mp3splice/radio//2017/04/Forum20170422a.mp3&lt;/ref&gt; regarding his criticism of the March and remarked that the millennial generation is just finding its feet with regard to activism and should be encouraged. Ratan also distinguished between being political and being partisan and suggested that while the March for Science is a political act, it is by no means partisan, which implies blind allegiance to one party over another. Ratan reiterated that the March For Science supports evidence-based policy-making regardless of party or affiliation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4387">A '''Master of Physics''' (or '''MPhys (Hons)''' ) honours [[academic degree|degree]] is a specific [[master's degree]] for courses in the field of [[physics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102074249/http://ucas.com/documents/ucasguides/scottishguide2010.pdf |archivedate=2010-01-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
In [[England]] and [[Wales]], the MPhys is an [[Undergraduate education|undergraduate]] award available after pursuing a four-year course of study at a [[university]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/activity/education/Careers/Publications/file_31428.pdf|title=Education|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]] the course has a five-year duration. In some universities, the degree has the variant abbreviation '''MSci'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ugstudy/courses/physicsandastronomy/msci-physics.aspx|title=Physics MSci - The University of Nottingham|website=Nottingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/coursefinder/courses/79936.html|title=MSci Physics|website=Qmul.ac.u|accessdate=2 September 2017k}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/physics/physics-msci.aspx|title=Undergraduate degree course/programme in Physics MSc F302i – School of Physics and Astronomy, University of Birmingham - University of Birmingham|website=Birmingham.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/study/undergraduate/2015/physics/msci-physics/|title=MSci Physics - Study at Bristol - University of Bristol|website=Bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/careers/i-am-at-school-college/undergraduate-courses/page_57508.html|title=Undergraduate courses|website=Iop.org|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are taught courses, with a [[research]] element in the final year — this can vary from a small component to an entire year working with a research group — and are not available as [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] qualifications in most cases, although depending on institution the final year can be considered as approximately equivalent to an [[Master of Science|MSc]].

===Structure===
In terms of course structure, MPhys degrees usually follow the pattern familiar from [[bachelor's degree]]s with [[lecture]]s, [[laboratory]] work, [[coursework]] and [[exam]]s each year. Usually one, or more commonly two, substantial projects are to be completed in the fourth year which may well have research elements. At the end of the second or third years, there is usually a threshold of academic performance in examinations to be reached to allow progression into the final year. Final results are, in most cases, awarded on the standard [[British undergraduate degree classification]] scale, although some universities award something structurally similar to 'Distinction', 'Merit', 'Pass' or 'Fail', as this is often the way that taught postgraduate master's degrees are classified.

===Degree schemes===
It is usual for there to be some variation in the MPhys schemes, to allow for students to study the area of physics which most interests them. For example, [[Lancaster University]]'s physics department offer the following&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lancs.ac.uk/depts/physics/ugAdmissions/index.htm|title=Physics|website=Lancs.ac.uk|accessdate=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; schemes:
*MPhys Physics
*MPhys Physics, [[Astrophysics]] and [[Cosmology]]
*MPhys Physics with [[Particle Physics]] and Cosmology
*MPhys Physics with [[Space Science]]
*MPhys Physics with Biomedical Physics
*MPhys [[Theoretical Physics]]
*MPhys Theoretical Physics with [[Mathematics]]

These schemes will usually incorporate the same core modules with additional scheme specific modules. Students tend to take all the same core modules during their first year and start to specialise in their second year. In some cases, optional modules can be taken from other schemes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13249">'''Meta-reference''' is a special type of [[self-reference]] that can occur in all media or medial artefacts, for instance literature, film, painting, TV series, comic strips, or video games. It includes all references to, or comments on, a specific medium, medial artefact, or the media in general. These references and comments originate from a logically higher level (a 'meta-level') within any given artefact, and draw attention to -- or invite reflection about -- media-related issues (e.g. the production, performance, or reception) of said artefact, specific other artefacts (as in [[parody]]), or to parts, or the entirety, of the medial system. It is, therefore, the recipient's awareness of an artefact's medial quality that distinguishes meta-reference from more general forms of [[self-reference]]. Thus, meta-reference triggers media-awareness within the recipient, who, in turn "becomes conscious of both the medial (or 'fictional' in the sense of artificial and, sometimes in addition, 'invented') status of the work" as well as "the fact that media-related phenomena are at issue, rather than (hetero-)references to the world outside the media."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies.|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although certain devices, such as [[Mise en abyme (in literature and other media)|mise en abyme]], may be conducive to meta-reference, they are not necessarily metareferential themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Wolf|first=Werner|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, innately metareferential devices, such as [[metalepsis]], are to be seen as special cases of meta-reference. The terms meta-reference and [[metalepsis]] can, therefore, not be used synonymously.

== History of the concept and the term ==
While meta-reference as a concept is not a new phenomenon and can be observed in very early works of art and media not tied to specific purposes (e.g. Homer's invocation of the muses at the beginning of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' in order to deliver the epic better), the term itself is relatively new.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Werner|first=Wolf|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier discussions of metareferential issues often opt for more specific terminology tied to the respective discipline. Notable discussions of meta-reference include, but are not limited to, William H. Gass's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fiction and the Figures of Life|last=Gass|first=William|publisher=Knopf|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Scholes's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scholes|first=Robert|date=1970|title=Metafiction|url=|journal=Iowa Review|volume=1|pages=100-115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; exploration of [[metafiction]], Victor Stoichita's examination of early modern meta-painting,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Self-Aware Image. An Insight into Early Modern Meta-Painting|last=Stoichita|first=Victor|publisher=Studies in Baroque Art|year=2015|isbn=978-1909400115|location=Antwerp|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lionel Abel's&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Metatheatre. A New View of Dramatic Form.|last=Abel|first=Lionel|publisher=Hill &amp; Wang|year=1963|isbn=|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; investigation of [[metatheatre]]. In the context of drama, meta-reference has also become colloquially known as the breaking of the [[fourth wall]]. The first study to underscore the problem resulting from the lack of cohesive terminology, as well as the necessity to acknowledge metareference as transmedial and trans-generic phenomenon, was published in 2007 by Hauthal et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/155834217|title=Metaisierung in Literatur und anderen Medien : theoretische Grundlagen, historische Perspektiven, Metagattungen, Funktionen|date=2007|publisher=De Gruyter|others=Hauthal, Janine.|isbn=3110199459|location=Berlin|oclc=155834217}}&lt;/ref&gt; Publications by Nöth and Bishara&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/471132600|title=Self-reference in the media|date=2007|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|others=Bishara, Nina, 1977-, Nöth, Winfried.|isbn=3110194643|location=Berlin|oclc=471132600}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Wolf&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/436342321|title=Metareference across media : theory and case studies|date=2009|publisher=Rodopi|others=Wolf, Werner, 1955-, Bantleon, Katharina., Thoss, Jeff., Bernhart, Walter.|isbn=9789042026704|location=Amsterdam|oclc=436342321}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed suit, raised similar concerns, included case studies from various media, coined and helped establish the more uniform umbrella term meta-reference as define above.

== Examples ==
While every medium has the potential for meta-reference, some media can transport meta-reference more easily than others. Media that can easily realise its meta-referential potential includes, for instance, literature, painting, and film. Although music can be meta-referential even outside the confines of lyrics, meta-reference in music is much harder to create or detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Michaelsen|first=René|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=235-259|chapter=Exploring Metareference in Instrumental Music -- The Case of Robert Schumann}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self-Reference in the Media|last=Wolf|first=Werner|date=|publisher=Mouton de Gruyter|year=2007|isbn=978-3-11-019464-7|editor-last=Nöth|editor-first=Winfried|location=Berlin|pages=303-325|chapter=Metafiction and Metamusic: Exploring the Limits of Metareference}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music, therefore, would be a less typical medium for the occurrence of meta-reference. Nöth argues in this context that although non-verbal media can be the home of meta-reference, the contained meta-reference can only be implicit because non-verbal media can only show similarites, but never point directly (or explicitly) to meta-referential elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Metareference across Media. Theory and Case Studies|last=Nöth|first=Winfried|date=|publisher=Rodopi|year=2009|isbn=978-90-420-2670-4|editor-last=Wolf|editor-first=Werner|location=Amsterdam - New York, NY|pages=889-121|chapter=Metareference from a Semiotic Perspective}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others, however, argue that meta-reference is explicit as long as it is clear.

=== Literature ===
John Fowles begins chapter 13 of his novel ''The French Lieutenant's Woman'' with the words&lt;blockquote&gt;This ''story'' I am ''telling'' is all ''imagination''. These ''characters'' I create never existed outside my own mind. If I have pretended until now to know my ''characters''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' mind and innermost thoughts, it is because I am ''writing'' in [...] a ''convention'' universally accepted at the time of my ''story'': that the ''novelist'' stands next to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The French Lieutenant's Woman|last=Fowels|first=John|publisher=Vintage|year=2005|isbn=978-0-099-49707-3|location=London|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; [emphases added]&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is an example of explicit meta-reference because the text draws attention to the fact that the novel the recipient is reading is merely a fiction created by the author. It also foregrounds the convention that readers of realist fiction accept the presence of an all-knowing narrator, and breaks it by allowing the narrator to take centre stage which invites meta-reflections by the recipient.

=== Film ===
''[[The Truman Show]]'' is a movie that contains a high degree of meta-reference. Truman, the protagonist, is unaware that he is part of a reality TV show, but the audience knows about the artificiality of both Truman's life and, by extension, the movie that is being watched. This is underscored by putting emphasis on the production process of the fictional reality TV show, which makes the audience aware of the same features being used in the movie at the time of watching. Further examples of meta-reference in the movie include spotlights falling from the sky seemingly out of the blue, or a raincloud which is curiously only raining on Truman following him around on Seahaven Beach. Both instances point to the artificiality of Truman's life as well as the film itself.

=== Painting ===
[[File:Edouard Manet - The Balcony - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|214x214px|
Manet, ''The Balcony''
]]
An example of meta-reference in painting is ''Manet's Balcony'' by [[René Magritte]]. It comments on another painting, [[The Balcony (painting)|''The Balcony'']] by [[Édouard Manet]], by mimicking both the setting of the balcony as well as the poses of the depicted people, but places them in coffins. Thus, the recipient's attention is drawn to the fact that not only are the people in the painting long dead and only still 'alive' in the representation, but arguably also that the artist ([[Édouard Manet|Manet]]) and the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style are just as dead as the portrayed individuals. Furthermore, it is foregrounded that the [[Impressionism|impressionist]] painting style is just a style that may be copied, which further emphasises the fact that both works are only paintings created in a specific way.

The '''Mondialogo Engineering Award''' was established by [[Daimler AG|Daimler]] and [[UNESCO]] to encourage cooperation and dialogue between engineering people from different countries and cultures, working together across continents on a joint project activity. The award invites student engineers from universities around the world to apply for Award. It was supported by the World Federation of Engineering Organisations ([[WFEO]]), who promoted it to its national members and took part in the judging panel.
The scheme has closed with Daimler and UNESCO ending their partnership in 2010. It is not clear if an alternative sponsor or scheme will be created.

==Previous Rounds==

The first round of the competition 2005 ended with a symposium in Berlin while the second round in 2007 ended in Mumbai. In its first round, the Mondialogo Engineering Award brought over 1,700 young engineers from 79 countries together to work on engineering solutions tackling [[poverty]] and promoting [[sustainable development]] in all regions of the world. While in the second round 3200 students from 89 countries participated.

==Goals==

The Mondialogo Engineering Award invited engineering students in developing and developed countries to form international teams to create project proposals that address the [[Millennium Development Goals|United Nations Millennium Development]] to 1) eradicate [[extreme poverty]] and [[hunger]]; 2) achieve [[universal primary education]]; 3) promote [[gender equality]] and [[Empowerment|empower]] women; 4) reduce [[child mortality]]; 5) improve [[maternal health]]; 6) combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]] and other diseases; 7) ensure environmental [[sustainability]]; and 8) develop global partnerships for development. Mondialogo encourages proposals that will improve the [[quality of life]] in the developing world, particularly [[Poverty reduction|poverty eradication]] and the promotion of sustainable development.

==Procedure==

International [[Project team|Project Teams]] eligible to apply for the Mondialogo Engineering Award consisted of two student groups from two higher education establishments, with one group from a developing country and the other from a developed country. The Mondialogo Internet Portal www.mondialogo.org acts as a contact centre for groups to meet each other, aiming to function as a virtual office for inter-group communications. Teams had until April 2009 to develop and design their project proposals. An international jury then assessed the entries and decide on the awarding, which formed part of a festive ceremony in latter 2009. Key factors in the assessment are sustainability, technical quality, feasibility of the project proposals and the quality of the intercultural cooperation between the teams.

==Criteria==

The following criteria were taken into consideration when assessing the final project proposals:
Quality of project – quality of analysis and understanding of a relevant problem, quality and innovativeness of project idea and design, and quality of presentation of the project proposal 
Degree to which the project addresses the Millennium Development Goals, especially poverty eradication and sustainable social development 
Relevance of project proposal in mitigating negative impacts of [[climate change]] 
Feasibility of the proposed project – demonstration of the practicality of implementing the proposed project, and benefit to local community; 
Quality of Dialogue – level of communication within project teams and student groups, balanced involvement of both student groups

==Awards==

Ten Mondialogo Engineering Awards of €20,000 went to teams with the top project proposals, with an Honourable Mention and €5,000 earmarked for twenty more teams. Representatives of the 30 finalist project teams (consisting of one member of each student group two members of each International Project Team) were invited to the Mondialogo Engineering Award Symposium. At the Symposium, each team made a presentation of their project proposal, followed by an Award Ceremony where the Mondialogo Engineering Awards and Honourable Mentions were announced. All participating teams that submit project proposals received an official certificate in recognition of their achievements and their commitment to the worldwide exchange of knowledge and intercultural dialogue. Additionally, Daimler and UNESCO publicized the 30 winning projects.

==Eligibility to participate==

Students from all fields of engineering were eligible to register for the Mondialogo Engineering Award. All members of the two (or more) student groups must have been officially registered as students at universities, technical colleges or similar institutions through to May 2009. Employees of commercial institutions and companies or students above 35 years of age were not eligible to participate.

The '''multiple nuclei model''' is an economical model created by [[Chauncy Harris]] and [[Edward Ullman]] in the 1945 article "The Nature of Cities".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Chauncy D.|last2=Ullman|first2=Edward L.|date=1945-01-01|title=The Nature of Cities|jstor=1026055|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=242|pages=7–17|doi=10.2307/1026055}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Model==
The model describes the layout of a city, based on Chicago. It says that even though a city may have begun with a [[central business district]], or CBD, other smaller CBDs develop on the outskirts of the city near the more valuable housing areas to allow shorter commutes from the outskirts of the city. This creates nodes or nuclei in other parts of the city besides the CBD thus the name multiple nuclei model. Their aim was to produce a more realistic, if more complicated, model. Their main goals in this were to:
# Move away from the concentric zone model
# To better reflect the complex nature of urban areas, especially those of larger size

==Effects of multiple nuclei on Industry==
As multiple nuclei develop, transportation hubs such as airports are constructed which allow industries to be established with reduced transportation costs.
These transportation hubs have [[negative externalities]] such as noise pollution and lower land values, making land around the hub cheaper. Hotels are also constructed near airports because people who travel tend to want to stay near the source of travel. Housing develops in wedges and gets more expensive the farther it is from the CBD.&lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. eBook. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for the model==

Harris and Ullman argued that cities do not grow a single nucleus but several separate nuclei. Each nucleus acts like a growth point.

The theory was formed based on the idea that people have greater movement due to increased car ownership. This increase of movement allows for the specialization of regional centers (e.g. heavy industry, business parks, retail areas). The model is suitable for the large, expanding cities. The number of nuclei around which the city expands depends upon situational as well as historical factors. Multiple nuclei develop because:
# Certain industrial activities require transportation facilities e.g. ports, railway stations, etc. to lower transportation costs.
# Various combinations of activities tend to be kept apart e.g. residential areas and airports, factories and parks, etc.
# Other activities are found together to their mutual advantage e.g. universities, bookstores and coffee shops, etc.
# Some facilities need to be set in specific areas in a city - for example the CBD requires convenient traffic systems, and many factories need an abundant source of resources.

==Assumptions for Model &lt;ref&gt;Swanson, Kelly. Kaplan AP Human Geography. 2009. 2009. 360-364. eBook. &lt;https://books.google.com/books?&lt;/ref&gt;==
#Land is not flat in all areas
#Even Distribution of Resources
#Even Distribution of people in Residential areas
#Even Transportation Costs

[[File:Klaviatur-3-en.svg|thumb|right|Layout of a [[musical keyboard]] (three [[octave]]s shown).]]

In [[music]], '''gesture''' is any movement, either physical (bodily) or mental (imaginary). As such "gesture" includes both categories of movements required to produce sound and categories of perceptual moves associated with those gestures. The concept of musical gestures has received much attention in various musicological disciplines (e.g. [[musical analysis|music analysis]], [[music therapy]],  [[music psychology]], [[NIME]]) in recent years.

For example, the "musical" movement from a [[voicing (music)|close-position]] [[tonic (music)|tonic]] C [[major chord]] to a close-position [[dominant (music)|dominant]] G major chord requires on the [[piano]] the physical movement from each white key of the first chord to the right (in space, upwards in pitch) four white [[key (instrument)|keys]] or [[steps and skips|steps]]. Thus gesture includes both characteristic physical movements by performers and characteristic [[melody|melodies]], [[phrase (music)|phrases]], [[chord progression]]s, and [[arpeggio|arpeggiations]] produced by (or producing) those movements.

==Introduction==
The concept of musical gestures encompasses a large territory stretching from details of sound-production to more global emotive and aesthetic images of music, and also include considerations of cultural-stylistic vs. more universal modes of expression. In all cases, it is believed that musical gestures manifest the primordial role of human movement in music. For this reason, scholars speak of [[embodied music cognition]] in the sense that listeners relate musical sound to mental images of gestures, i.e. that listening (or even merely imagining music) also is a process of incessant mental re-enactment of musical gestures.

Acknowledging the [[wikt:Special:Search/multimodal|multimodal]] nature of music perception, embodied music cognition could represent a change of [[paradigm]] in music theory and other music related research, research which has often tended to exclude considerations of bodily movement from its conceptual apparatus in favour of focus on more abstract, notation-based elements of music. Focusing on musical gestures provides a coherent and unifying perspective for a renewal of music theory and other music research.

==Music-related body movement==
A subset of musical gestures is what could be called music-related body movement, which can be seen from either the performer's or the perceiver's point of view:
* Performer - movements that are part of a music performance or a performance with music:
** Sound-producing: musician or actor creating musical sound.
** Sound-accompanying: dance or other types of movements that are linked to music.
* Perceiver - movements that are an integral part of music listening:
** Directly connected: dance, air performance
** Loosely connected: running, training.
** Grooving: tapping a foot, nodding the head, etc.

== Formal definition ==

The first mathematical definition of gesture is given in the paper  "Formulas, Diagrams, and Gestures in Music" (Journal of Mathematics and Music, Vol 1, Nr. 1 2007) by [[Guerino Mazzola]] (University of Minnesota) and Moreno Andreatta (IRCAM in Paris). A gesture is a configuration of curves in space and time. More formally, a gesture is a digraph morphism from a "skeleton" of addressed points to a "body", a spatial digraph of a topological category (in the musical case: time, position and pitch). Since the set of gestures of given skeleton and topological category defines a topological category, one may define gestures of gestures, so-called hypergestures.

==Gesture in Indian vocal music==
{{see|Music of India}}
Indian vocalists move their hands while improvising melody.  Although every vocalist has an idiosyncratic gestural style, the motion of the hand and voice are connected through various logics, and many students gesturally resemble their teachers.  Nikki Moran, at the University of London, has done research on this topic, and it is one of the subjects of [[Martin Clayton (ethnomusicologist)|Martin Clayton]] and Laura Leante's Musical Experience Project at the Open University.

Clayton has published a paper on gestural interaction in Indian music performance: "Time, Gesture and Attention in a Khyal Performance." ''Asian Music'', 38 (2), 71–96.

Matt Rahaim, a vocalist and ethnomusicologist, has published a book on the relationship between vocalization and gesture in Indian vocal music: ''Musicking Bodies: Gesture and Voice in Hindustani Music''.  Rahaim's work approaches gesture and vocalization as parallel expressions of melody, investigates isomorphisms between gesture space and raga space, and studies the transmission and inheritance of "paramparic bodies"--vocal/postural/gestural dispositions handed down through teaching lineages.

==Hatten's Musical Gestures==
Robert Hatten (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Hatten, Robert (2004). ''Interpreting Musical Gestures, Topics, and Tropes: Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert'', {{page needed|date=December 2010}}. {{ISBN|0-253-34459-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has been using the concept of musical gestures to denote inner-musical qualities:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Musical gesture is biologically and culturally grounded in communicative human movement. Gesture draws upon the close interaction (and intermodality) of a range of human perceptual and motor systems to synthesize the energetic shaping of motion through time into significant events with unique expressive force. The biological and cultural motivations of musical gesture are further negotiated within the conventions of a musical style, whose elements include both the discrete (pitch, rhythm, meter) and the analog (dynamics, articulation, temporal pacing). Musical gestures are emergent gestalts that convey affective motion, emotion, and agency by fusing otherwise separate elements into continuities of shape and force."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Bandt, Duffy, and MacKinnon (2007). ''Hearing Places'', p.355. {{ISBN|1-84718-255-0}}.

The '''Independent Printing House CDN''' (better known as '''CDN''', {{Lang-pl|Niezależna Oficyna Wydawnicza CDN}}) was an [[Polish underground press|underground printing house]] (''bibuła'') operating in [[Poland]] between 1982 and 1990. 

Formed after the imposition of the [[Martial Law in Poland]], it focused on publishing various mostly history-related books. Apart from the modern history of Poland and [[Central Europe]], the topics included also other topics banned by the Communist censorship, including sociology and politology. The CDN also published a number of magazines and music tapes, among them a series of cassettes featuring the songs of [[Jan Krzysztof Kelus]].

'''''Partially Buried Woodshed''''' is a work of [[land art]] created by American artist [[Robert Smithson]] in January 1970 at [[Kent State University]] in [[Kent, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/partially.htm|title=Partially Buried Woodshed |website=RobertSmithson.com |access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work consisted of an existing woodshed and earth added by the artist in order to illustrate the concept of entropy. As of 2018, only a large mound of dirt and the structure's concrete foundation remain. The remaining elements, along with an informational plaque, is located in a small wooded area immediately behind the [[Liquid Crystal Institute]] building on the Kent State University main campus.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;{{cite web |title=Robert I. Smithson, Partially Buried Woodshed papers |url=http://speccoll.library.kent.edu/other/smithson.html |publisher=Kent State University Special Collections and Archives |accessdate=October 3, 2018 |date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Partially Buried Woodshed Remains.jpg|thumb|Stone remains of the Partially Buried Woodshed]]
[[File:Partially Buried Woodshed Plaque.jpg|thumb|Plaque marking the site of the Partially Buried Woodshed]]
In January 1970 [[Robert Smithson]] visited Kent State University as part of the School of Art Creative Arts Festival. Initially, he had planned to do a mudflow sculpture, but cold temperatures prevented him from being able to dig the dirt needed for the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mudflow sculptor buries woodshed |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19700123-01.2.2 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |date=January 23, 1970 |page=1 |volume=LV |number=47 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he created ''Partially Buried Woodshed'' using an old woodshed from a former farm on the eastern edge of campus that had recently been acquired by the school. Smithson rented a backhoe and transported 20 truck loads of dirt onto the right side of the woodshed until the center beam cracked, marking the beginning of the structure’s decline. He valued the work at $10,000 and donated it to the university, asking that no changes be made and that the structure be allowed to deteriorate naturally. Shortly after the May 4, 1970, [[Kent State shootings]], an anonymous person added the inscription 'MAY 4 KENT 70' with white paint to one of the structure's horizontal beams.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.robertsmithson.com/earthworks/partially_det5.htm|title=Partially Buried Woodshed detail |date=1970-1974|website=RobertSmithson.com |access-date=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The addition of the message about May 4, 1970 helped make the ''Partially Buried Woodshed'' one of the many memorial sites on campus.&lt;ref name="archives" /&gt; 

The work was set on fire by an unknown arsonist on March 28th, 1975, burning much of the left side and causing the structure's major collapse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Robert Smithson's Partially Buried Woodshed|last=Shinn|first=Dorothy|year=1990|isbn=|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University Arts Commission recommended in April that the roof and burned portion be removed, mostly citing safety concerns, with the remaining walls, earthen mound, and rafters remaining to continue the natural aging process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Natural aging of earth sculpture urged |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750422-01.2.19 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Halfhill, Tom |date=April 22, 1975 |page=5 |volume=XLVIII |number=89 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late April, the university had much of the damaged section removed and planned to landscape the area around the sculpture as a park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Smithson sculpture removed, memorial plate to be placed |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750430-01.2.23 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |date=April 30, 1975 |page=6 |volume=XLVIII |number=94 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smithson's widow, Nancy Holt, visited the work May 3, 1975, and called for its preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Earth artwork ‘questions everything,’ says widow |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19750509-01.2.30 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Halfhill, Tom |date=May 9, 1975 |page=8 |volume=XLVIII |number=100 |accessdate=October 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A committee recommended in June 1975 that the entire sculpture be removed, citing liability concerns, though university president Glenn Olds ultimately decided to keep the remains of the sculpture in 1976. Sometime in mid-1981, the center beam fully broke, and in January 1984, the remaining wooden elements of the structure were quietly removed by the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wood shed continues natural return to landscape |url=https://dks.library.kent.edu/cgi-bin/kentstate?a=d&amp;d=dks19810925-01.2.32 |newspaper=Daily Kent Stater |author=Glasko, Robert |date=September 25, 1981 |accessdate=October 5, 2018 |volume=LV |number=17 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the School of Art hosted exhibits in 1990 for the 20th anniversary of the work's creation, and again in 2005 for the 35th anniversary, the location of the artwork was largely ignored until Kent State University added an informational plaque to a sidewalk near the site in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buried Treasure |url=https://www.kent.edu/magazine/shed |work=Kent State Magazine |date=Spring 2016 |accessdate=October 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pennsylvania State University School of Hospitality Management''' (also known as SHM) is located at the main campus of [[The Pennsylvania State University]] in [[University Park, Pennsylvania]] and serves over 500 students. SHM is one of the three oldest continually-operating hospitality management programs in the United States and offers a [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.S.), [[Master of Science]] (M.S.) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) in [[Hospitality Management]]. The B.S. Degree offers an optional minor in Entrepreneurship and Innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhdev.psu.edu/shm/programs |title=Academic Programs &amp;#124; Hospitality Management at Penn State |publisher=Hhdev.psu.edu |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The hospitality management program at [[Penn State]] formally began in 1937 as an outgrowth of Institutional Management and was originally known as Hotel Administration.

In 1958, the program became Food Service and Housing Administration (FSHA), dividing the Hotel Administration major into two separate majors – Commercial Food Service and Institutional Resident Management.

In the 1970s, the program became focused on Service Management and Administrative Dietetics.

In 1981, the program name changed again, and the Department of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management (HRIM) was formed. The department was upgraded in 1987, and the School of Hotel, Restaurant and Institutional Management was created. In 2005, the program was renamed the School of Hospitality Management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hhdev.psu.edu/shm/about/history |title=History &amp;#124; Hospitality Management at Penn State |publisher=Hhdev.psu.edu |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mateer Building and Cafe Laura==
[[File:Mateer Building- Penn State School of Hospitality Management.JPG|thumb|Mateer Building- Penn State School of Hospitality Management]]
The School of Hospitality Management is located in the Mateer Building on the northwest corner of Penn State's [[University Park, PA|University Park campus]] near the intersection of [[Atherton Street]] and Park Avenue. Mateer was completed in 1993 and is named after A. Laura Mateer and her husband M.C. "Matty" Mateer in whose memory she had donated $1.5 million to the School.

{{for|the Philip K. Dick story|Project Plowshare}}
The '''Plowshares Project''' is a [[Peace Studies]] collaborative between [[Manchester University (Indiana)|Manchester University]], [[Earlham College]] and [[Goshen College]] in [[Indiana]].

==History==
The Plowshares Project was formed in 2002, and is funded by a four-year grant from [[Eli Lilly and Company]]. The project defines its mission and goals by the religious ethos of the [[Church of the Brethren]], the [[Society of Friends]], and [[Mennonite Church USA]].

==Purpose==
Plowshares was initiated to enrich the Peace Studies programs at Manchester, Earlham, and Goshen colleges. The program facilitates channels of discussion, and seeks to uphold the peacemaking traditions of the colleges' [[peace churches|founding churches]].

==Declared goals==
With the Lilly grant, the Plowshares Program intends to:
*''Further Expand Peace Studies Programs''—by creating an international resource for peace studies education, strengthening educators, and offering grants for student research.
*''Unification of Peace Studies Courses''—through discussion and program development by founding schools.
*''Increase Awareness of Peace Studies and Related Issues''—by creating a community presence to inform respective communities and nation of happenings and to distinguish Indiana as a strong base for peace studies.

==Peace House==
The Peace House is the main outlet for community involvement for the Plowshares Project. Located in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], the house serves as a hub for undergraduate students from any US college or university, and in any major, to become directly involved in the fields of peace and justice. 

The Peace House provides semester-long residence for students pursuing internships with Indianapolis companies and organizations who are involved or concerned with peace and justice issues. There is also a nine-week summer intensive available for students. 

===Fall and spring semesters===
During the regular semester, students at the Peace House take two Peace Studies courses taught by adjunct faculty. From the Plowshares website:
*''Introduction to Urban Peace and Justice Issues''— combined with an introduction to the city of Indianapolis
*''Peacemaking in Practice''—focusing on "self-reflection, strategic planning and practical skills for non-violent social change&lt;ref&gt;1&lt;/ref&gt;"

====Internship====
The internship session mediated by Peace House allows for '''up to''' 20 hours of work per week under the supervision of the Peace House director; the work grants up to six credit hours. 

===Summer session===
The nine-week summer session operates without the class work, but still facilitates a full-time internship. The student may work up to 40 hours per week with a selected organization, and may still earn up to six credit hours. During the summer, students may also reside at the Peace House without earning college credit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1550">The '''Polish School''' (also known as '''New Polish School''') is the music of several post-1945 Polish composers who share generational and stylistic similarities. Representatives include [[Tadeusz Baird]], [[Henryk Górecki]], [[Wojciech Kilar]], [[Witold Lutosławski]], [[Krzysztof Penderecki]], and [[Kazimierz Serocki]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollack p. 465&lt;/ref&gt; According to Polish music scholar Adrian Thomas, [[Zygmunt Mycielski]] used the term at the [[Łagów, Świebodzin County|Łagów]] conference in 1949, and it was later used at the 1956 [[Warsaw Autumn]] festival.&lt;ref name = "Thomas159"&gt;Thomas 2005, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt; Their common purpose was in part retrospective, reacting to [[socialist realism]], and in part speculative.&lt;ref name = "Thomas159" /&gt; [[Sound mass]] and [[sonorism]] influenced these post-war composers.&lt;ref&gt;Rappoport-Gelfand pp. 68-69&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48338">The '''theory of positive disintegration''' ('''TPD''') by [[Kazimierz Dąbrowski]] is a theory of [[personality development]]. Unlike mainstream [[psychology]], Dąbrowski's theoretical framework views psychological tension and [[anxiety]] as necessary for growth.  These "disintegrative" processes are therefore seen as "positive", whereas people who fail to go through positive disintegration may remain for their entire lives in a state of "primary integration", lacking true individuality. Advancing into disintegration and into the higher levels of development is predicated on having developmental potential, including overexcitabilities, above-average reactions to stimuli.

Unlike some other theories of development such as [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development]], it is not assumed that even a majority of people progress through all levels.  TPD is not a theory of stages, and levels do not correlate with age.

==Dąbrowski's theory==
Kazimierz Dąbrowski (1902–1980), a [[Poland|Polish]] [[psychiatrist]] and [[psychologist]], developed the Theory of Positive Disintegration which culminated in his 1964 publication of the book by the same name, "Positive Disintegration". He was heavily influenced by his [[Catholic]] upbringing which taught personal sacrifice and perpetual torment. His experience as a victim of [[medical torture]] for several months as a member of the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]], being only one of the 36 surviving psychiatrists in Poland out of the 400 practicing at the beginning of the war, informed his world view. He pursued a lifelong obsession with self-mutilation resulting in his semi-autobiographical 1937 work, "Psychological Basis of Self Mutilation." He believed that the key to the treatment of mental illness was intense personal suffering and hence marked the self-infliction of suffering as essential to personal development. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=C4sf_XDicrUC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s |title=Dabrowski's Theory of Positive Disintegration |year = 2008| page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vtechworks.lib.vt.edu/bitstream/handle/10919/26692/Dissertation.pdf?sequence=2 |title=A Hermeneutic Historical Study of Kazimierz Dabrowski and his Theory of Positive Disintegration| year=2002|author=Battaglia, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dąbrowski's theory of personality development emphasised several major features including:

* personality is not a given universal trait, it must be created&amp;mdash;shaped&amp;mdash;by the individual to reflect his or her own unique character (personality shaping)
* personality develops as a result of the action of developmental potential (DP) (overexcitability and the autonomous factor), not everyone displays sufficient DP to create a unique personality.
* developmental potential is represented in the population by a [[normal distribution|normal]] (bell) curve.  Dąbrowski used a multilevel approach to describe the continuum of developmental levels seen in the population.
* developmental potential creates crises characterized by strong anxieties and depressions&amp;mdash;psychoneurosis&amp;mdash;that precipitate disintegration
* for personality to develop, initial integrations based on instinct and socialization must disintegrate&amp;mdash;a process Dąbrowski called positive disintegration
* the development of a hierarchy of individual values&amp;mdash;[[emotional]] reactions&amp;mdash;is a critical component in developing one's personality and one's autonomy, thus, in contrast to most psychological theories, emotions play a major role in this approach
* emotional reactions guide the individual in creating his or her individual personality ideal, an autonomous standard that acts as the goal of individual development
* the individual must examine his or her essence and subsequently make existential choices that emphasize those aspects of essence that are higher and "more myself" and inhibit those aspects that are lower or "less myself" based upon his or her own personality ideal
* critical components of individual development include autoeducation and autopsychotherapy

===Factors in development===
Dąbrowski observed that most people live their lives in a state of "primary or primitive integration" largely guided by biological impulses ("first factor") and/or by uncritical endorsement and adherence to social convention ("second factor"). He called this initial integration Level I. Dąbrowski observed that at this level there is no true individual expression of the autonomous human self. Individual expression at Level I is influenced and constrained by the first two factors.

The first factor channels energy and talents toward accomplishing self-serving goals that reflect the lower instincts and biological ego—its primary focus is on survival and self-advancement. Often talents are used in antisocial or asocial ways. For example, at the lowest edge of Level I many criminals display this type of selfish behavior.  They advance their own goals at the expense of others.

The second factor, the social environment (milieu) and [[peer pressure]], constrains individual expression and [[creativity]] by encouraging a group view of life and discouraging unique thought and expression. The second factor externalizes values and morals, thereby externalizing conscience. Social forces shape expectations.  Behavior and one's talents and creativity are funneled into forms that follow and support the existing social milieu. "My mom says we should always be aware of what our lawn looks like because we want other people to think well of us when they drive by." Because conscience is derived from an external social context, so long as society holds ethical standards, people influenced by the second factor will behave ethically.  However, if a society becomes corrupt, people strongly influenced by second factor will not dissent. [[Socialization]] without individual examination leads to a rote and robotic existence (the "robopath" described by [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]). Individual reactions are not unique, they are based upon social contexts ("I cry at funerals and laugh at weddings—everyone does"). According to Dąbrowski, people primarily motivated by second factor represent a significant majority of the general population.

Dąbrowski felt that our society was largely influenced by these lower two factors and could be characterized as operating at Level I. For example, our emphasis on corporate success ("a dog eat dog mentality") means that many [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]]s operate on the basis of first factor—they will quickly sacrifice another to enhance their own advancement. As well, our educational, political, corporate, and media systems are self-promoting and discourage real examination or individual autonomy—the second factor. Alternatively, social justifications are often used: "of course I break the speed limit, everyone does."  Or a soldier may explain that he or she was simply "following orders". Thus, this external value system absolves the individual of any individual responsibility.

Dąbrowski also described a group of people who display a different course: an individualized developmental pathway. These people break away from an automatic, rote, socialized view of life (which Dąbrowski called negative adjustment) and move into and through a series of personal disintegrations. Dąbrowski saw these disintegrations as a key element in the overall developmental process. Crises challenge our [[status quo]] and cause us to review our self, ideas, values, thoughts, ideals, etc. If development continues, one goes on to develop an individualized, conscious and critically evaluated [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] value structure (called positive adjustment). This hierarchy of values acts as a benchmark by which all things are now seen, and the higher values in our internal hierarchy come to direct our behavior (no longer based on external social mores). These higher, individual values characterize an eventual second integration reflecting individual autonomy and for Dąbrowski, mark the arrival of true human personality. At this level, each person develops his or her own vision of how life ought to be and lives it. This higher level is associated with strong individual approaches to problem solving and creativity. One's talents and creativity are applied in the service of these higher individual values and visions of how life could be—how the world ought to be. The person expresses his or her "new" autonomous personality energetically through action, art, social change and so on.

===Development potential===
Advanced development is often seen in people who exhibit strong developmental potential ("DP"). Developmental potential represents a constellation of genetic features, expressed and mediated through environmental interaction.  Many factors are incorporated in developmental potential but three major aspects are highlighted: overexcitability (OE), specific abilities and talents, and a strong drive toward autonomous growth, a feature Dąbrowski called the "third factor".

====Overexcitability====

The most evident aspect of developmental potential is [[overexcitability]] (OE), a heightened physiological experience of stimuli resulting from increased neuronal sensitivities. The greater the OE, the more intense are the day-to-day experiences of life. Dąbrowski outlined five forms of OE: psychomotor, sensual, imaginational, intellectual, and emotional. These overexcitabilities, especially the latter three, often cause a person to experience daily life more intensely and to feel the extremes of the joys and sorrows of life profoundly. Dąbrowski studied human exemplars and found that heightened overexcitability was a key part of their developmental and life experience. These people are steered and driven by their value "rudder", their sense of emotional OE. Combined with imaginational and intellectual OE, these people have a powerful perception of the world.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1972|p=6}}

Although based in the nervous system, overexcitabilities come to be expressed psychologically through the development of structures that reflect the emerging autonomous self. The most important of these conceptualizations are dynamisms: biological or mental forces that control behavior and its development. Instincts, drives and intellectual processes combined with emotions are dynamisms.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1972|p=294}} With advanced development, dynamisms increasingly reflect movement toward autonomy.

====Abilities and talents====

The second arm of developmental potential, specific abilities and talents, tends to serve the person's developmental level. As outlined, people at lower levels use talents to support egocentric goals or to climb the social and corporate ladders. At higher levels, specific talents and abilities become an important force as they are channeled by the person's value hierarchy into expressing and achieving the person's vision of his or her ideal personality and his or her view of how the world ought to be.

====The third factor====

The third aspect of developmental potential (DP), which is simply referred to as 'the third factor', is a drive toward individual growth and autonomy. The third factor is critical as it applies one's talents and creativity toward autonomous expression, and second, it provides motivation to strive for more and to try to imagine and achieve goals currently beyond one's grasp. Dąbrowski was clear to differentiate third factor from [[free will]]. He felt that free will did not go far enough in capturing the motivating aspects that he attributed to third factor.  For example, an individual can exercise free will and show little motivation to grow or change as an individual. Third factor specifically describes a motivation—a motivation to become one's self. This motivation is often so strong that  in some situations we can observe that one needs to develop oneself and that in so doing, it places one at great peril.  This feeling of "I've gotta be me"  especially when it is "at any cost" and especially when it is expressed as a strong motivator for self-growth is beyond the usual conceptualization ascribed to free will.

A person whose DP is high enough ''will generally'' undergo disintegration, despite any external social or family efforts to prevent it. A person whose DP is low will ''generally not'' undergo disintegration (or positive personality growth) even in a conducive environment.

The notion that some people have an innate potential for development that is determined by a higher sensitivity or overexcitability (analogous to the first aspect of DP) and by a related tendency to develop individual differences and autonomy from the group (analogous to the third aspect of DP) was independently developed by Elaine Aron (see [[Highly sensitive person]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aron |first=E. N. |url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.9371&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |title=The Clinical Implications of Jungs Concept of Sensitiveness |journal=Journal of Jungian Theory and Practice |volume=8 |year=2006 |issue= |pages=11–43 |quote=Sensitive persons can certainly have mood disorders, but should not be mistaken for being chronically depressed only because of a pessimistic view of the future of the world or of their own abilities (a pessimism which may well be accurate, as in the case of depressive realism). Likewise they do not have an anxiety disorder merely because they worry more than the nonsensitive, and they do not have a personality disorder (avoidant, dependent, obsessive-compulsive, etc.) merely because their unusualness has been present throughout their lives as an impediment to the cheerful, resilient functioning expected of most people most of the time.... They cannot shut out the world's achingly subtle, fleeting beauty or its inexplicable cruelty and suffering. They must find their own meaning in it. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117225340/http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.490.9371&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf |archivedate=2016-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (although it should be noted that Aron's approach is substantially different from Dąbrowski's).

====Developmental obstacles====
Dąbrowski called OE "a tragic gift" to reflect that the road of the person with strong OE is not a smooth or easy one. Potentials to experience great highs are also potentials to experience great lows. Similarly, potentials to express great creativity hold the likelihood of experiencing a great deal of personal conflict and [[Stress (medicine)|stress]]. This stress both drives development and is a result of developmental conflicts, both intrapsychic and social. [[Suicide]] is a significant risk in the acute phases of this stress. The isolation often experienced by these people heightens the risk of [[self-harm]].

Dąbrowski advocated [[#Autopsychotherapy|autopsychotherapy]], educating the person about OEs and the disintegrative process to give him or her a context within which to understand intense feelings and needs. Dąbrowski suggested giving people support in their efforts to develop and find their own [[self-expression]]. Children and adults with high DP have to find and walk their own path, often at the expense of fitting in with their social peers and even with their families.  At the core of autopsychotherapy is the awareness that no one can show anyone else the "right" path.  Everyone has to find their own path for themselves.  As Joseph Campbell described the knights on the [[Grail Quest]]: If a path exists in the forest, don't follow it, for though it took someone else to the Grail, it will not take you there, because it is not your path.

==The levels==
The first and fifth levels are characterized by psychological integration, harmony, and little inner conflict. There is little internal conflict at Level I because just about every behavior is justified—it is either good for the individual and is therefore "right", or the individual's society endorses it and it is therefore "right".  In either case, with a high level of confidence the individual acts as he or she perceives anyone else would, and does what anyone is "supposed to do". At Level V there is no internal conflict because what a person does is always in accord with their own internal sense of values. Of course, there is often external conflict at both Levels I and V.

Levels II, III and IV describe various degrees and types of dis-integration and literal disease.

Dąbrowski was very clear that the levels he presents "represent a heuristic device". In the process of development the structures of two or even three contiguous levels may exist side by side, although it must be understood that they exist in conflict. The conflict is resolved when one of the structures is eliminated, or at least comes under complete control of another structure.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1996|p=17}}

===Level I: Primary integration===
As outlined above, the first level is called primitive or primary integration. People at this level are often influenced primarily by either prominent first factor (heredity/impulse) and/or second factor (social environment) forces.  The majority of people at Level I are integrated at the environmental or social level (Dąbrowski called them average people); however, many also exhibit shades of both impulse and socialization. Dąbrowski distinguished the two subgroups of Level I by degree: "the state of primary integration is a state contrary to mental health. A fairly high degree of primary integration is present in the average person; a very high degree of primary integration is present in the psychopath".{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=121}} Marked by selfishness and [[egocentrism]] (both reticent and explicit), those at level one development generally seek self-fulfillment above all, justifying their pursuits through a sort of "it's all about me" thinking; or, more simply put, they adhere strongly to the phrase "the end justifies the means", sometimes disregarding the severity of the "means". Many people who are considered "leaders" often fall into this category.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=127}}

A vast majority of people either do not break down their primitive integration at all, or after a relatively short period of disintegration, usually experienced at the time of adolescence and early youth, end in a reintegration at the former level or in partial integration of some of the functions at slightly higher levels, without a transformation of the whole mental structure.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|Kawczak|Piechowski|1970|p=4}}

===Level II: Unilevel disintegration===
The prominent feature of this level is an initial, brief and often intense [[crisis]] or series of crises.  Crises are spontaneous and occur on only one level. These crises involve alternatives that may appear to be different but ultimately are on the same level.

Unilevel disintegration occurs during developmental crises such as puberty or menopause, in periods of difficulty in handling some stressful external event, or under psychological and psychopathological conditions such as nervousness and psychoneurosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=A more or less organized form of growth through positive disintegration. Lower psychoneuroses are predominantly psychosomatic in nature, higher psychoneuroses are highly conscious internal struggles whose tensions and frustrations are not anymore translated into somatic disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unilevel disintegration consists of processes on a single structural and emotional level; there is a prevalence of automatic dynamisms with only slight self-consciousness and self-control.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=6}}

Conflicts on the same level (horizontal) produce ambitendencies and ambivalences: the person is equally attracted by different but equivalent choices on the same level (ambitendencies) and is not able to decide what to do because he or she has no real preference between the choices (ambivalences).  If developmental forces are strong enough, ultimately, the person is thrust into an [[existentialism|existential]] crisis: one's social rationales no longer account for one's experiences and there are no alternative explanations.  During this phase, existential despair is the predominant emotion.  The resolution of this phase begins as individually chosen values begin to replace [[social mores]] that have been ingrained by rote and are integrated into a new hierarchy of personal values.  These new values often conflict with the person's previous social values.  Many of the status quo explanations for the "way things are," learned through education and from the social order, collapse under conscious, individual scrutiny. This causes more conflicts focused on the person's analysis of his or her own reactions to the world at large and of the behavior of self and others. Common behaviors and the ethics of the prevailing social order come to be seen as inadequate, wrong or hypocritical.  Positive maladjustment prevails. For Dąbrowski, these crises represent a strong potential for development toward personal growth and mental health.  Using a positive definition, mental health reflects more than social conformity: it involves a careful, personal examination of the world and of one's values, leading to the development of an individual personality.

Level II is a transitional period. Dąbrowski said you either fall back (reintegration on a lower level), end negatively, in suicide or [[psychosis]] or move ahead to Level III.{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1964|p=7}}

The transition from Level II to Level III involves a fundamental shift that requires a phenomenal amount of energy.  This period is the crossroads of development: from here one must either progress or regress. The struggle between Dąbrowski's three factors reflects this transitional crisis: "Do I follow my instincts (first factor), my teachings (second factor) or my heart (third factor)?"  The developmental answer is to transform one's lower instincts (automatic reactions like anger) into positive motivation, to resist rote and social answers, and to listen to one's inner sense of what one ought to do.

===Level III: Spontaneous multilevel disintegration===
Level III describes a new type of conflict: a vertical conflict between two alternatives that are not simply different, but that exist on different levels. One is genuinely higher and the other is lower in comparison. These vertical conflicts initially arise from involuntary perceptions of higher versus lower choices in life. "You just look at something, maybe for the 1000th time (to use the words of [[G. K. Chesterton]]), and it strikes you—you see this one thing differently and once you do, it changes things. You can no longer "go back and see it the way you did before"." Dąbrowski called this vertical dimension multilevelness. Multilevelness is a gradual realization of the "possibility of the higher" (a phrase Dąbrowski used frequently) and of the subsequent contrasts between the higher and the lower in life. These vertical comparisons often illustrate the lower, actual behavior of a person in contrast to higher, imagined ideals and alternative idealized choices. Dąbrowski believed that the authentic individual would choose the higher path as the clear and obvious one to follow (erasing the ambivalences and ambitendencies of unilevel conflicts). If the person's actual behavior subsequently falls short of the ideal, internal disharmony and a drive to review and reconstruct one's life often follow. Multilevelness thus represents a new and powerful type of conflict, a conflict that is developmental in Dąbrowski's approach.

These vertical conflicts are critical in leading to autonomy and advanced personality growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Disintegration is multilevel (or vertical), if there are conflicts between higher and lower levels of instinctive, emotional or intellectual functions, e.g. higher and lower forms of the sexual instinct, or the instinct of self-preservation, etc. It consists mainly in differentiation and hierarchization of various levels of functions with a tendency towards gradual stabilization of a new hierarchy. In the course of positive multilevel disintegration primitive, animalistic drives and structures are subject to a disintegration, that is weakening, loosening and even total destruction under the impact of developmental dynamisms (cf.) and gradually give way to new, higher levels and new, higher structures. There is a growth of consciousness of inner conflicts, self-consciousness and self-control. The processes of inner psychic transformation gain in intensity and authenticity (cf.). There is a gradual build-up of the inner psychic milieu (cf.) with its main dynamisms such as "subject-object" in oneself, the third factor, inner psychic transformation, autonomy and authentism, and the personality ideal.}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the person is to achieve higher levels, the shift to multilevelness must occur. If a person does not have the developmental potential to move into a multilevel view, then he or she will fall back from the crises of Level II to reintegrate at Level I. In the shift to multilevelness, the horizontal (unilevel), stimulus-response model of life is replaced by a vertical and hierarchical analysis. This vertical view becomes anchored by one's emerging individual value structure, and all events are seen in relation to personal ideals. These personal value ideals become the personality ideal: how the person wants to live his or her life. As events in life are seen in relation to this multilevel, vertical view, it becomes impossible to support positions that favor the lower course when higher goals can be identified (or imagined).

===Level IV: Directed multilevel disintegration===
In Level IV the person takes full control of his or her development. The involuntary spontaneous development of Level III is replaced by a deliberate, conscious and self-directed review of life from the multilevel perspective. This level marks the real emergence of the third factor, described by Dąbrowski as an autonomous factor "of conscious choice (valuation) by which one affirms or rejects certain qualities in oneself and in one's environment".{{sfn|Dąbrowski|1972|p=306}} The person consciously reviews his or her existing belief system and tries to replace lower, automatic views and reactions with carefully thought out, examined and chosen ideals. These new values will increasingly be reflected in the person's behavior. Behavior becomes less reactive, less automatic and more deliberate as behavioral choices fall under the influence of the person's higher, chosen ideals.

Social mores are reviewed and re-accepted by a conscious internalization when the individual feels it is appropriate. Likewise, when the person feels it is proper, a social value is reviewed and may be rejected to be replaced by a self perceived higher alternative value. One's social orientation comes to reflect a deep responsibility based on both intellectual and emotional factors. At the highest levels, "individuals of this kind feel responsible for the realization of justice and for the protection of others against harm and injustice. Their feelings of responsibility extend almost to everything."{{sfn|Dąbrowski|Kawczak|Sochanska|1973|p=97}} This perspective results from seeing life in relation to one's hierarchy of values (the multilevel view) and the subsequent appreciation of the potential of how life could be, and ought to be, lived. One's disagreements with the (lower level) world are expressed compassionately in doing what one can to help achieve the "ought".

Given their genuine (authentic) prosocial outlook, people achieving higher development also raise the level of their society. Prosocial here is not just support of the existing social order. If the social order is lower and you are adjusted to it, then you also reflect the lower (negative adjustment in Dąbrowski's terms, a Level I feature). Here, prosocial is a genuine cultivation of social interactions based on higher values. These positions often conflict with the status quo of a lower society (positive maladjustment). In other words, to be maladjusted to a low-level society is a positive feature.

===Level V: Secondary integration===
The fifth level displays an integrated and harmonious character, but one vastly different from that at the first level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=The integration of all mental functions into a harmonious structure controlled by higher emotions such as the dynamism of personality ideal, autonomy and authenticity. Secondary integration is the outcome of the full process of positive disintegration.}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this highest level, one's behavior is guided by conscious, carefully weighed decisions based on an individualized and chosen hierarchy of personal values. Behavior conforms to this inner standard of how life ought to be lived, and thus little inner conflict arises.

Level V is often marked by creative expression. Especially at Level V, problem solving and art represent the highest and noblest features of human life. Art captures the innermost emotional states and is based on a deep empathy and understanding of the subject. Often, human suffering and sacrifice are the subjects of these works. Truly visionary works, works that are unique and novel, are created by people expressing a vision unrestrained by convention. Advances in society, through politics, philosophy and religion, are therefore commonly associated with strong individual creativity or accomplishments.

==Applications==

===Therapy===

The theory of positive disintegration has an extremely broad scope and has implications for many areas. One central application applies to psychological and psychiatric diagnosis and treatment. Dąbrowski advocated a comprehensive, multidimensional diagnosis of the person's situation, including symptoms and developmental potentials.

====Symptoms and developmental potentials====
If the disintegration appears to fit into a developmental context, then the person is educated in the theory and encouraged to take a developmental view of his or her situation and experiences. Rather than being eliminated, symptoms are reframed to yield insight and understanding into life and the person's unique situation.

====The importance of narratives====

Dąbrowski illustrated his theory through autobiographies of and biographies about those who have experienced positive disintegration. The gifted child, the suicidal teen or the troubled artist is often experiencing the features of TPD, and if they accept and understand the meaning of their intense feelings and crises, they can move ahead, not fall apart. The completion of an extensive autobiography to help the individual gain perspective on his or her past and present is an important component in the autopsychotherapy process. In this process, the therapist plays a very small role and acts more as an initial stimulus than an ongoing therapist.  Dąbrowski asked clients to read his books and to see how his ideas might relate to their lives.

====Autopsychotherapy====

For Dąbrowski, the goal of therapy is to eliminate the therapist by providing a context within which a person can understand and help oneself, an approach to therapy that he called autopsychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Psychotherapy, preventive measures, or changes in living conditions consciously applied to oneself in order to control possible mental disequilibrium.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The client is encouraged to embark on a journey of self-discovery with an emphasis on looking for the contrast between what is higher versus what is lower within his or her personality and value structure. The person is encouraged to further explore his or her value structure especially as it relates to the rationale and justification of positions. Discrepancies between values and behavior are highlighted. The approach is called autopsychotherapy to emphasize the important role that the individual must play in his or her own therapy process and in the larger process of personality development.  The individual must come to see that he or she is in charge of determining or creating his or her own unique personality ideal and value structure. This includes a critical review of social mores and values that have been learned.

Dąbrowski was very concerned about what he called one-sided development&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.positivedisintegration.com/glos.htm |title=A glossary of Dabrowski's terms and concepts. |website=positivedisintegration.com |quote=Type of development limited to one talent or ability, or to a narrow range of abilities and mental functions. In such development the creative instinct and empathy appear absent. In exceptionally capable individuals their one-sided development may come under the control of a primitive disposing and directing center and in the extreme case may take the form of psychopathy or paranoia.}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in which people display significant advanced development in only one aspect of life, usually intellectual. He believed that it is crucial to balance one's development.

====Overexcitability====

Dąbrowski also encouraged people to see their reactions (overexcitabilities) and their [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] view of the world in the context of their developmental potential. The experience of, and reaction to, crises are a very important aspect of this approach and people are encouraged to experience personal crises with a positive and developmental view.

Dąbrowski reminds clients that without internal disease there is little stimulus for change or growth. Rather than trying to rapidly ameliorate symptoms, this approach encourages individuals to fully experience their feelings and to try to maintain a positive and developmental orientation to what they may perceive as strong depression or anxiety. Of course, this is a unique approach in today's world of seeking immediate and total relief of any unpleasant psychological experience (although it can be compared to Aron's to some extent).

===Education===

Another primary focus is on education, in particular, over the past 25 years, on the experience of creative and [[gifted]]
students. Dąbrowski hypothesized that these students will disproportionately show strong overexcitability and therefore will be prone to the disintegrative process.

==Dąbrowski and the gifted individual==
In an appendix to Dąbrowski (1967), results of investigations done in 1962 with Polish youth are reported. Specifically, "a group of gifted children and young people aged 8 to 23" were examined (p.&amp;nbsp;251). Of the 80 youth studied, 30 were "intellectually gifted" and 50 were from "drama, ballet, and plastic art schools" (p.&amp;nbsp;251). Dąbrowski found that every one of the children displayed overexcitability, "which constituted the foundation for the emergence of neurotic and psychoneurotic sets. Moreover it turned out that these children also showed sets of nervousness, neurosis, and psychoneurosis of various kinds and intensities, from light vegetative symptoms, or anxiety symptoms, to distinctly and highly intensive psychasthenic or hysterical sets" (p.&amp;nbsp;253). Dąbrowski asked why these children should display such "states of nervousness or psychoneurosis" and suggested that it was due to the presence of OE (p.&amp;nbsp;255). "Probably the cause is more than average sensitivity which not only permits one to achieve outstanding results in learning and work, but at the same time increases the number of points sensitive to all experiences that may accelerate anomalous reactions revealing themselves in psychoneurotic sets" (p.&amp;nbsp;255).

The association between OE and giftedness appears to be borne out in the research (Lysy and Piechowski 1983; Piechowski 1986; Piechowski and Miller 1995). It appears that at the least OE is a marker of potential for giftedness/creativity. Dąbrowski's basic message is that the gifted will disproportionately display this process of positive disintegration and personality growth.

==Key ideas==
The theory is based on numerous key ideas:

*That our lower animal instincts (first factor) must be inhibited and transformed into "higher" forces for us to be Human (this ability to transform our instincts is what separates us from other animals).
*That the common initial personality integration, based upon socialization (second factor), does not reflect true personality.
*At the initial level of integration, there is little internal conflict as when one "goes along with the group", there is little sense of individual wrongdoing. External conflicts often relate to the blockage of social goals—career frustrations for example. The social mores and values prevail with little question or conscious examination.
*True personality must be based upon a system of values that are consciously and volitionally chosen by the person to reflect their own individual sense of "how life ought to be" and their "personality ideal"—the ideal person they feel they "ought to be".
*The lower animal instincts and the forces of peer groups and [[socialization]] are inferior to the autonomous self (personality) constructed by the conscious person.
*To break down the initial integration, crises and disintegrations are needed, usually provided by life experience.
*These disintegrations are positive if the person can achieve positive and developmental solutions to the situation.
*"Unilevel crises" are not developmental as the person can only choose between equal alternatives (go left or go right?).
*A new type of perception involves "multilevelness", a vertical view of life that compares lower versus higher alternatives and now allows the individual to choose a higher resolution to a crisis over other available, but lower, alternatives—the developmental solution.
*"Positive disintegration" is a vital developmental process.
*Dąbrowski developed the idea of "developmental potential" to describe the forces needed to achieve autonomous personality development.
*Developmental potential includes several factors including innate abilities and talents, "overexcitability" and the "third factor".
*Overexcitability is a measure of an individual's level of nervous response. Dąbrowski found that the exemplars he studied all displayed an overly sensitive nervous system, also making them prone to [[angst]], depression and anxiety—psychoneuroses in Dąbrowski's terms, a very positive and developmental feature.
*The third factor is a measure of an individual's drive toward autonomy.
*Dąbrowski's approach is very interesting philosophically as it is Platonic, reflecting the bias of [[Plato]] toward [[essence]]—an individual's essence is a critical determinant of his or her developmental course in life. However, Dąbrowski also added a major [[Existentialism|existential]] aspect as well, what one depends upon the anxieties felt and on how one resolves the day to day challenges one faces. Essence must be realized through an existential and experiential process of development. The characterization advanced by [[Kierkegaard]] of "Knights of faith" may be compared to Dąbrowski's autonomous individual.
*Reviewed the role of logic and reasoning in development and concludes that intellect alone does not fully help us know what to do in life. Incorporates [[Jean Piaget]]'s views of development into a broader scheme guided by emotion. Emotion (how one feels about something) is the more accurate guide to life's major decisions.
*When multilevel and autonomous development is achieved, a secondary integration is seen reflecting the mature personality state. The individual has no inner conflict; they are in internal harmony as their actions reflect their deeply felt hierarchy of values.
*Rejected [[Abraham Maslow]]'s description of [[self-actualization]] (Dąbrowski was a personal friend and correspondent of Maslow's). Actualization of an undifferentiated human self is not a developmental outcome in Dąbrowski's terms. Dąbrowski applied a multilevel (vertical) approach to self and saw the need to become aware of and to inhibit and reject the lower instinctual aspects of the intrinsic human self (aspects that Maslow would have us "embrace without guilt") and to actively choose and assemble higher elements into a new unique self. Dąbrowski would have us differentiate the initial self into higher and lower aspects, as we define them, and to reject the lower and actualize the higher in creating our unique personality.

==Secondary integration versus self-actualization==
People have often equated Maslow's concept of self-actualization with Dąbrowski's level of secondary integration. There are some major differences between these two ideas. Fundamentally, Maslow described self-actualization as a process where the  self is accepted "as is",  so both higher and lower aspects of the self are actualized. Dąbrowski introduces the notion that although the lower aspects may  initially be intrinsic to the self, as human beings we are able to become aware of their lower nature.  We are able to develop [[self-awareness]] into how we feel about these low levels—if we feel badly about behaving in these  lower ways, then we are able to cognitively and volitionally  decide to inhibit and eliminate these behaviors. In this way, the  higher aspects of the self  are actualized while the lower aspects are inhibited and, for Dąbrowski, this is what is unique about humans and sets us apart from other animals— No other animal is able to differentiate their lower instincts and therefore can not inhibit their animalistic impulses. Dąbrowski has gone beyond Maslow's idea of self-actualization and it is not appropriate to equate the two authors on this point.

==Obstacles to the theory==
Both Dąbrowski and his work have faced many obstacles. Personally, he was severely affected by both [[World Wars]]. His work went against the grain as a humanistic theory promoting personal growth in the political atmosphere of [[Poland]] in the 1950s and 1960s. Another problem has been language. Dąbrowski wrote in [[Polish language|Polish]] and translated his works into [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. [[English language|English]] was the last language he learned and likely the most difficult in terms of capturing the subtleties of his ideas. In spite of these problems, Dąbrowski persevered with his studies of human development, developed his theory and practiced psychiatry all his life.

Dąbrowski died in 1980 and his students went on to explore careers of their own. Many of these students continue to study and speak on the theory, most advancing a deeply personal understanding of what the theory means to them.

Since 1980, there has been a small but consistent demand for Dąbrowski's works. This demand has largely evolved in the United States where Michael Piechowski applied his vision of the theory to gifted education. Many in education and in [[gifted education]] have looked to Dąbrowski's theory to help provide a context for their students. Although a small part of the overall theory, this aspect has generated a number of Master's and Ph.D. theses and introduced the theory to a large audience.

The reader interested in Dąbrowski has faced a serious scarcity of resources, especially of Dąbrowski's English works. His books are long out of print and rare, and his papers are held by a few people but not circulated. There are also many Polish works by Dąbrowski (about 20 books) on the theory, on psychotherapy, on education and on philosophy that have not been translated into English.

One severe hurdle to the investigation and study of the theory of positive disintegration is the fact that no suitable psychological test exists that measures any Dąbrowskian constructs well. The most widely known instrument, the Overexcitability Questionnaire—Two, has poor psychometric properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|title=An investigation of measurement invariance across genders on the Overexcitability Questionnaire--Two|journal=Journal of Advanced Academics|date=2011|volume=22|pages=578-293|doi=10.1177/1932202x11414821|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1932202x11414821|accessdate=21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:David_Deutsch.jpg|thumb|right|Model of [[DNA]] with  [[David Deutsch]], proponent of invariant scientific explanations. ''See [[Scientific method#DNA example|synopsis of scientific method]]'']]
The '''scientific method''' is an [[empirical]] method of knowledge acquisition which has characterized the development of [[science]] since at least the 17th century. It involves careful observation, which includes rigorous [[skepticism]] about what is observed, given that [[Philosophy of science#Observation inseparable from theory|cognitive assumptions]] about how the world works influence how one interprets a [[Perception#Process and terminology|percept]]. It involves formulating [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]], via [[Inductive reasoning|induction]], based on such observations; [[experiment]]al and measurement-based testing of [[Deductive reasoning|deductions]] drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are ''principles'' of the scientific method, as opposed to a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|last=Newton|first=Issac|work=The Principia: Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy|publisher=University of California Press|others=Includes "A Guide to Newton's Principia" by I.

Though there are diverse models for the scientific method available, in general there is a continuous process that includes observations about the natural world. People are naturally inquisitive, so they often come up with questions about things they see or hear, and they often develop ideas or [[hypotheses]] about why things are the way they are. The best hypotheses lead to predictions that can be tested in various ways. The most conclusive testing of hypotheses comes from reasoning based on carefully controlled experimental data. Depending on how well additional tests match the predictions, the original hypothesis may require refinement, alteration, expansion or even rejection. If a particular hypothesis becomes very well supported, a general [[scientific theory|theory]] may be developed.&lt;ref name="Garland2015"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/scientific_method/story.htm | title =The Scientific Method as an Ongoing Process | date= 20 March 2015 | last =Garland, Jr. | first =Theodore | publisher =UC Riverside | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20160819164005/http://idea.ucr.edu/documents/flash/scientific_method/story.htm | archive-date =19 August 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although procedures vary from one [[Branches of science|field of inquiry]] to another, they are frequently the same from one to another. The process of the scientific method involves making [[conjecture]]s (hypotheses), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.&lt;ref name=NA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, {{harvnb|Galileo|1638}}. His [[thought experiment]]s disprove Aristotle's physics of falling bodies, in ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be [[falsifiable]], implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Popper|1959|p=273}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [[observation]]s agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Karl R. Popper, ''Conjectures and Refutations: The Growth of Scientific Knowledge'', Routledge, 2003 {{ISBN|0415285941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]]. There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Gauch |first1= Hugh G. |title=Scientific Method in Practice |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iVkugqNG9dAC |edition=Reprint |publisher=Cambridge University Press |date=2003 |page=3 |isbn=978-0521017084 |quote=The scientific method 'is often misrepresented as a fixed sequence of steps,' rather than being seen for what it truly is, 'a highly variable and creative process' (AAAS 2000:18). The claim here is that science has general principles that must be mastered to increase productivity and enhance perspective, not that these principles provide a simple and automated sequence of steps to follow.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order.&lt;ref name=Gauch2003 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Inductive Science 1837"&gt;[[William Whewell]], ''History of Inductive Science'' (1837), and in ''Philosophy of Inductive Science'' (1840)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some philosophers and scientists have argued that there is no scientific method; they include physicist [[Lee Smolin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bigthink.com/in-their-own-words/there-is-no-scientific-method |title=There is No Scientific Method |last1=Smolin |first1=Lee |access-date=2016-06-07|date=May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and philosopher [[Paul Feyerabend]] (in his ''[[Against Method]]''). Robert Nola and Howard Sankey remark that "For some, the whole idea of a theory of scientific method is yester-year's debate, the continuation of which can be summed up as yet more of the proverbial deceased equine castigation. We beg to differ."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|date=2001 |title=After Popper, Kuhn and Feyerabend.

Important debates in the history of science concern [[rationalism]], especially as advocated by [[René Descartes]]; [[inductivism]] and/or [[empiricism]], as argued for by [[Francis Bacon]], and rising to particular prominence with [[Isaac Newton]] and his followers; and [[hypothetico-deductivism]], which came to the fore in the early 19th century.

The term "scientific method" did not come into wide use until the 19th century, when other modern scientific terminologies began to emerge such as "scientist" and "pseudoscience" and significant transformation of science was taking place.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; Throughout the 1830s and 1850s, by which time Baconianism was popular, naturalists like William Whewell, John Herschel, John Stuart Mill engaged in debates over "induction" and "facts" and were focused on how to generate knowledge.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; In the late 19th a debate over [[Philosophical realism|realism]] vs. [[antirealism]] was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite book |author=Achinstein, Peter |title=General Introduction |pages=1–5 |work=Science Rules: A Historical Introduction to Scientific Methods |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |date=2004 |isbn=978-0801879432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "scientific method" came to be used prominently in the twentieth century, with no scientific authorities over its meaning despite it popping up in textbooks and dictionaries.&lt;ref name="Thurs"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thurs|first1=Daniel|editor1-last=Shank|editor1-first=Michael|editor2-last=Numbers|editor2-first=Ronald|editor3-last=Harrison|editor3-first=Peter|title=Wrestling with Nature : From Omens to Science|date=2011|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226317830|page=307–36|chapter=12. Scientific Method}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though there was a steady growth on the concept into the twentieth century, by the end of that century numerous influential philosophers of science like Thomas Kuhn and Paul Feyerabend had questioned the universality of the "scientific method" and in doing so largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice.&lt;ref name="Thurs" /&gt; In particular, Paul Feyerabend argued against there being any universal rules of [[science]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The scientific method is the process by which [[science]] is carried out.&lt;ref&gt;" The thesis of this book, as set forth in Chapter One, is that there are general principles applicable to all the sciences." __ {{harvnb| Gauch | 2003 |p= xv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As in other areas of inquiry, science (through the scientific method) can build on previous knowledge and develop a more sophisticated understanding of its topics of study over time.&lt;ref name=Fixation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb| Gauch | 2003 |p=1 }} The scientific method can function in the same way; This is the principle of noncontradiction.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis Bacon]](1629) ''[[New Organon]]'', lists 4 types of error: Idols of the tribe (error due to the entire human race), the cave (errors due to an individual's own intellect), the marketplace (errors due to false words), and the theater (errors due to incredulous acceptance).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Vital/&gt;&lt;ref name=Anti-fragility/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For example, the concept of [[Falsifiability|falsification]] (first proposed in 1934) formalizes the attempt to ''disprove'' hypotheses rather than prove them. ''Karl R. Popper (1963), 'The Logic of Scientific Discovery'. [http://www.cosmopolitanuniversity.ac/library/LogicofScientificDiscoveryPopper1959.pdf The Logic of Scientific Discovery] pp. 17–20, 249–52, 437–38, and elsewhere.''
* [[Leon Lederman]], for teaching [[physics first]], illustrates how to avoid confirmation bias: [[Ian Shelton]], in Chile, was initially skeptical that [[supernova 1987a]] was real, but possibly an artifact of instrumentation (null hypothesis), so he went outside and disproved his null hypothesis by observing SN 1987a with the naked eye. The [[Kamiokande]] experiment, in Japan, independently observed [[neutrino]]s from [[SN 1987a]] at the same time.&lt;/ref&gt; This model can be seen to underlie the [[scientific revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lindberg|2007|pp=2–3}}: "There is a danger that must be avoided. ... If we wish to do justice to the historical enterprise, we must take the past for what it was. And that means we must resist the temptation to scour the past for examples or precursors of modern science. ...My concern will be with the beginnings of scientific ''theories'', the methods by which they were formulated, and the uses to which they were put; ... "&lt;/ref&gt;

The ubiquitous element in the model of the scientific method is [[empiricism]], or more precisely, epistemologic [[sensualism]]. This is in opposition to stringent forms of [[rationalism]]: the scientific method embodies that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem. A strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of [[empiricism]] in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge; in current scientific practice, however, the use of [[scientific modelling]] and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted. The scientific method is of necessity also an expression of an opposition to claims that e.g. [[revelation]], political or religious [[dogma]], appeals to tradition, commonly held beliefs, common sense, or, importantly, currently held theories, are the only possible means of demonstrating truth.

Different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history, for instance with the ancient [[Stoics]], [[Epicurus]],&lt;ref name=Asmis&gt;Elizabeth Asmis (1985) ''Epicurus' Scientific Method''. Cornell University Press &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alhazen]],&lt;ref name="Alhazen"&gt;[[Alhazen]] argued the importance of forming questions and subsequently testing them: "How does light travel through transparent bodies? Light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only.... We have explained this exhaustively in our ''[[Book of Optics]]''. But let us now mention something to prove this convincingly: the fact that light travels in straight lines is clearly observed in the lights which enter into dark rooms through holes.... [T]he entering light will be clearly observable in the dust which fills the air. – Alhazen, ''Treatise on Light'' (رسالة في الضوء), translated into English from German by M. Schwarz, from [http://menadoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/dmg/periodical/pageview/30949 "Abhandlung über das Licht"], J. Baarmann (editor and translator from Arabic to German, 1882) ''[[Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesellschaft]]'' Vol '''36''' as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}}.
* He demonstrated his conjecture that "light travels through transparent bodies in straight lines only" by placing a straight stick or a taut thread next to the light beam, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=136}} to prove that light travels in a straight line.
* [[David Hockney]], (2001, 2006) in ''Secret Knowledge: rediscovering the lost techniques of the old masters'' {{ISBN|0142005126}} (expanded edition) cites Alhazen several times as the likely source for the portraiture technique using the [[camera obscura]], which Hockney rediscovered with the aid of an optical suggestion from [[Charles M. Falco]]. ''Kitab al-Manazir'', which is Alhazen's ''[[Book of Optics]]'', at that time denoted ''Opticae Thesaurus, Alhazen Arabis'', was translated from Arabic into Latin for European use as early as 1270. Hockney cites Friedrich Risner's 1572 Basle edition of ''Opticae Thesaurus''. Hockney quotes Alhazen as the first clear description of the camera obscura in Hockney, p. 240.
"Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough." – [[Alhazen]] ([[Ibn Al-Haytham]] 965 – c. 1040) ''[[Critique of Ptolemy]]'', translated by S. Pines, ''Actes X Congrès internationale d'histoire des sciences'', Vol '''I''' Ithaca 1962, as quoted in {{harvnb|Sambursky|1974|p=139}}. (This quotation is from Alhazen's critique of Ptolemy's books ''[[Almagest]]'', ''Planetary Hypotheses'', and [https://books.google.com/?id=mhLVHR5QAQkC&amp;pg=PA59&amp;dq=Opticae+thesaurus+alhazen ''Optics'' as translated into English by A. Mark Smith].)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Bacon]], and [[William of Ockham]]. From the 16th century onwards, experiments were advocated by [[Francis Bacon]], and performed by [[Giambattista della Porta]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wissensgeschichte-berlin.de/sites/default/files/2014_10_24_DellaPortaWS_Program_Abstracts.pdf|title=The optics of Giovan Battista della Porta (1535–1615): a reassessment.

* The full title translation is from p. 60 of James R. Voelkel (2001) ''Johannes Kepler and the New Astronomy'' Oxford University Press. Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible, because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image&amp;nbsp;– this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). Voelkel, p. 61, notes that Kepler's experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref&gt;...an approach which was advocated by Galileo in 1638 with the publication of ''[[Two New Sciences]]''.{{Citation|last=Galilei|first=Galileo|author-link=Galileo|title=Discorsi e Dimonstrazioni Matematiche, intorno a due nuoue scienze|location=[[Leiden|Leida]]|publisher=Apresso gli [[House of Elzevir|Elsevirri]]|year=1638|isbn=978-0486600994|title-link=Two New Sciences}}, Dover reprint of the 1914 Macmillan translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso de Salvio of ''Two New Sciences'', [[Galileo Galilei]] [[Accademia dei Lincei|Linceo]] (1638). Additional publication information is from the collection of first editions of the Library of Congress surveyed by {{harvnb|Bruno|1989|pp=261–64}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  There was particular development  aided by theoretical works by [[Francisco Sanches]],&lt;ref&gt;Sanches,Limbrick, and Thomson, 1988. ''[[That Nothing is Known]]''&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].

The [[hypothetico-deductive model]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Godfrey-Smith|2003}} p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt; formulated in the 20th century, is the ideal although it has undergone significant revision since first proposed (for a more formal discussion, see [[Scientific method#Elements of the scientific method|below]]). Staddon (2017) argues it is a mistake to try following rules&lt;ref name=Staddon2017 &gt;Staddon, J. (2017) ''Scientific Method: How science works, fails to work or pretends to work.'' Taylor and Francis.&lt;/ref&gt; which are best learned through careful study of examples of scientific investigation. 

===Process===
The overall process involves making [[conjectures]] ([[Hypothesis|hypotheses]]), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original [[conjecture]] was correct.&lt;ref name=NA /&gt; There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles.&lt;ref name=Gauch2003&gt;{{harvnb|Gauch |2003|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order. As noted by scientist and philosopher [[William Whewell]] (1794–1866), "invention, sagacity, [and] genius"&lt;ref name="Inductive Science 1837"/&gt; are required at every step.

====Formulation of a question====
The question can refer to the explanation of a specific [[observation]], as in "Why is the sky blue?" but can also be open-ended, as in "How can I [[Drug design|design a drug]] to cure this particular disease?" This stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments, personal scientific observations or assertions, as well as the work of other scientists. If the answer is already known, a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed. When applying the scientific method to research, determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Schuster and Powers (2005), Translational and Experimental Clinical Research, Ch. 1. [https://books.google.com/?id=C7pZftbI0ZMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Translational+and+Experimental+Clinical+Research Link.] This chapter also discusses the different types of research questions and how they are produced.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hypothesis====
A [[hypothesis]] is a [[conjecture]], based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question, that may explain any given behavior. The hypothesis might be very specific; for example, Einstein's [[equivalence principle]] or [[Francis Crick]]'s "DNA makes RNA makes protein",&lt;ref&gt;This phrasing is attributed to [[Marshall Nirenberg]].&lt;/ref&gt; or it might be broad; for example, unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans. A [[Statistical hypothesis testing#Definition of terms|statistical hypothesis]] is a [[conjecture]] about a given [[statistical population]]. For example, the population might be ''people with a particular disease.'' The conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of those people. Terms commonly associated with statistical hypotheses are [[null hypothesis]] and [[alternative hypothesis]]. A null hypothesis is the conjecture that the statistical hypothesis is false; for example, that the new drug does nothing and that any cure is caused by [[Luck|chance]]. Researchers normally want to show that the null hypothesis is false. The alternative hypothesis is the desired outcome, that the drug does better than chance. A final point: a scientific hypothesis must be [[falsifiable]], meaning that one can identify a possible outcome of an experiment that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, it cannot be meaningfully tested.

====Prediction====
This step involves determining the logical consequences of the hypothesis. One or more predictions are then selected for further testing. The more unlikely that a prediction would be correct simply by coincidence, then the more convincing it would be if the prediction were fulfilled; evidence is also stronger if the answer to the prediction is not already known, due to the effects of [[hindsight bias]] (see also [[postdiction]]). Ideally, the prediction must also distinguish the hypothesis from likely alternatives; if two hypotheses make the same prediction, observing the prediction to be correct is not evidence for either one over the other. (These statements about the relative strength of evidence can be mathematically derived using [[Bayes' Theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;Note: for a discussion of multiple hypotheses, see [[Bayesian inference#Informal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Testing====
This is an investigation of whether the real world behaves as predicted by the hypothesis. Scientists (and other people) test hypotheses by conducting [[experiment]]s. The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [[observations]] of the real world agree with or conflict with the predictions derived from a hypothesis. If they agree, confidence in the hypothesis increases; otherwise, it decreases. Agreement does not assure that the hypothesis is true; future experiments may reveal problems. [[Karl Popper]] advised scientists to try to falsify hypotheses, i.e., to search for and test those experiments that seem most doubtful. Large numbers of successful confirmations are not convincing if they arise from experiments that avoid risk.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Experiments should be designed to minimize possible errors, especially through the use of appropriate [[scientific control]]s. For example, tests of medical treatments are commonly run as [[Blind experiment#Double-blind trials|double-blind tests]]. Test personnel, who might unwittingly reveal to test subjects which samples are the desired test drugs and which are [[placebo]]s, are kept ignorant of which are which. Such hints can bias the responses of the test subjects. Furthermore, failure of an experiment does not necessarily mean the hypothesis is false. Experiments always depend on several hypotheses, e.g., that the test equipment is working properly, and a failure may be a failure of one of the auxiliary hypotheses. (See the [[Duhem–Quine thesis]].) Experiments can be conducted in a college lab, on a kitchen table, at CERN's [[Large Hadron Collider]], at the bottom of an ocean, on Mars (using one of the working [[Mars rover|rovers]]), and so on. Astronomers do experiments, searching for planets around distant stars. Finally, most individual experiments address highly specific topics for reasons of practicality. As a result, evidence about broader topics is usually accumulated gradually.

====Analysis====
This involves determining what the results of the experiment show and deciding on the next actions to take. The predictions of the hypothesis are compared to those of the null hypothesis, to determine which is better able to explain the data. In cases where an experiment is repeated many times, a [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] such as a [[chi-squared test]] may be required. If the evidence has falsified the hypothesis, a new hypothesis is required; if the experiment supports the hypothesis but the evidence is not strong enough for high confidence, other predictions from the hypothesis must be tested. Once a hypothesis is strongly supported by evidence, a new question can be asked to provide further insight on the same topic. Evidence from other scientists and experience are frequently incorporated at any stage in the process. Depending on the complexity of the experiment, many iterations may be required to gather sufficient evidence to answer a question with confidence, or to build up many answers to highly specific questions in order to answer a single broader question.

===DNA example===
[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|link=|alt=]]
The basic [[#Elements of the scientific method|elements of the scientific method]] are illustrated by the following example from the discovery of the structure of [[DNA]]:
* ''[[#DNA-characterizations|Question]]'': Previous investigation of DNA had determined its chemical composition (the four [[nucleotides]]), the structure of each individual nucleotide, and other properties. It had been identified as the carrier of genetic information by the [[Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment]] in 1944,&lt;ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985"&gt;{{harvnb|McCarty1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the mechanism of how genetic information was stored in DNA was unclear.
* ''[[#DNA-hypotheses|Hypothesis]]'': [[Linus Pauling]], [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure.&lt;ref&gt;October 1951, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=40}}:"That's what a helix should look like!" Crick exclaimed in delight (This is the Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theory of the transform of a helix).&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''[[#DNA-predictions|Prediction]]'': If DNA had a helical structure, its X-ray diffraction pattern would be X-shaped.&lt;ref&gt;June 1952, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Crick pp. 137–138"&gt;Watson did enough work on [[Tobacco mosaic virus]] to produce the diffraction pattern for a helix, per Crick's work on the transform of a helix. pp. 137–38, Horace Freeland Judson (1979) ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' {{ISBN|0671225405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction was determined using the mathematics of the helix transform, which had been derived by Cochran, Crick and Vand&lt;ref name="HelixTransform"&gt;–
Cochran W, Crick FHC and Vand V. (1952) "The Structure of Synthetic Polypeptides. I. The Transform of Atoms on a Helix", ''[[Acta Crystallographica|Acta Crystallogr.]]'', '''5''', 581–86.&lt;/ref&gt; (and independently by Stokes). This prediction was a mathematical construct, completely independent from the biological problem at hand.
* ''[[#DNA-experiments|Experiment]]'': [[Rosalind Franklin]] crystallized pure DNA and performed [[X-ray diffraction]] to produce [[photo 51]]. The results showed an X-shape.
* ''[[#DNA-iterations|Analysis]]'': When Watson saw the detailed diffraction pattern, he immediately recognized it as a helix.&lt;ref name="TeaTime"&gt;Friday, January 30, 1953. Tea time, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=52}}: Franklin confronts Watson and his paper – "Of course it [Pauling's pre-print] is wrong. DNA is not a helix." However, Watson then visits Wilkins' office, sees [[photo 51]], and immediately recognizes the diffraction pattern of a helical structure. But additional questions remained, requiring additional iterations of their research. For example, the number of strands in the backbone of the helix (Crick suspected 2 strands, but cautioned Watson to examine that more critically), the location of the base pairs (inside the backbone or outside the backbone), etc. One key point was that they realized that the quickest way to reach a result was not to continue a mathematical analysis, but to build a physical model.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson 1968 167"&gt;"The instant I saw the picture my mouth fell open and my pulse began to race." – {{harvnb|Watson|1968|p=167}} Page 168 shows the X-shaped pattern of the B-form of [[DNA]], clearly indicating crucial details of its helical structure to Watson and Crick.
* {{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 52 dates the Franklin-Watson confrontation as Friday, January 30, 1953. Later that evening, Watson urges Wilkins to begin model-building immediately. But Wilkins agrees to do so only after Franklin's departure.&lt;/ref&gt; He and Crick then produced their model, using this information along with the previously known information about DNA's composition and about molecular interactions such as [[hydrogen bonds]].&lt;ref name="SameShape"&gt;Saturday, February 28, 1953, as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=57–59}}: Watson found the base pairing mechanism which explained [[Chargaff's rules]] using his cardboard models.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery became the starting point for many further studies involving the genetic material, such as the field of [[molecular genetics]], and it was awarded the [[Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine|Nobel Prize]] in 1962. Each step of the example is examined in more detail later in the article.

===Other components===
The scientific method also includes other components required even when all the iterations of the steps above have been completed:&lt;ref&gt;[[Galileo Galilei]] (1638) ''[[Two new sciences]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

====Replication====
If an experiment cannot be [[Reproducibility|repeated]] to produce the same results, this implies that the original results might have been in error. As a result, it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times, especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of [[Observational error|experimental error]]. For significant or surprising results, other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves, especially if those results would be important to their own work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fyysika.ee/vorgustik/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Reconstruction-of-Galileo-Galilei.pdf|title=Reconstruction of Galileo Galilei's experiment – the inclined plane|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====External review====
The process of [[peer review]] involves evaluation of the experiment by experts, who typically give their opinions anonymously. Some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers, especially if the field is highly specialized. Peer review does not certify correctness of the results, only that, in the opinion of the reviewer, the experiments themselves were sound (based on the description supplied by the experimenter). If the work passes peer review, which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers, it will be published in a peer-reviewed [[Academic journal|scientific journal]]. The specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work.&lt;ref&gt;In ''Two new sciences'', there are three 'reviewers': Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati, who serve as foil, antagonist, and protagonist. Galileo speaks for himself only briefly. But note that Einstein's 1905 papers were not peer reviewed before their publication.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Data recording and sharing====
Scientists typically are careful in recording their data, a requirement promoted by [[Ludwik Fleck]] (1896–1961) and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fleck|1979|pp=xxvii–xxviii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though not typically required, they might be requested to [[Data sharing|supply this data]] to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results (or parts of their original results), extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://grants.nih.gov/grants/policy/data_sharing/index.htm NIH Data Sharing Policy]."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific inquiry==
Scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain [[knowledge]] in the form of [[Scientific theory|testable explanations]] that scientists can use to
[[Predictability|predict]] the results of future experiments. This allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study, and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms (such as to cure disease). The better an explanation is at making predictions, the more useful it frequently can be, and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives. The most successful explanations – those which explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances – are often called [[scientific theories]].

Most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding; improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time, sometimes across different domains of science.&lt;ref&gt;Stanovich, Keith E. (2007). ''How to Think Straight About Psychology''. Boston: Pearson Education. p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long, and in their acceptance in the scientific community. In general, explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic, and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence. Often subsequent researchers re-formulate the explanations over time, or combined explanations to produce new explanations.

Tow sees the scientific method in terms of an [[evolutionary algorithm]] applied to science and technology.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] Of great significance is the evolutionary algorithm, which uses a simplified subset of the process of natural evolution applied to find the solution to problems that are too complex to solve by traditional analytic methods. In essence it is a process of accelerated and rigorous trial and error building on previous knowledge to refine an existing hypothesis, or discarding it altogether to find a better model. [...] The evolutionary algorithm is a technique derived from the evolution of knowledge processing applied within the context of science and technology, itself an outcome of evolution. The scientific method continues to evolve through adaptive reward, trial and error and application of the method to itself.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Properties of scientific inquiry===

Scientific knowledge is closely tied to [[empirical]] findings, and can remain subject to [[falsifiability|falsification]] if new experimental observation incompatible with it is found. That is, no theory can ever be considered final, since new problematic evidence might be discovered. If such evidence is found, a new theory may be proposed, or (more commonly) it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence. The strength of a theory can be argued{{by whom|date=December 2016}} to relate to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles.

Theories can also become subsumed by other theories. For example, Newton's laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets   [[#Another example: precession of Mercury|almost perfectly]]. However, these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory ([[Theory of relativity|relativity]]), which explained both the (previously unexplained) exceptions to Newton's laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of [[light]] by [[gravity]]. Thus, in certain cases independent, unconnected, scientific observations can be connected to each other, unified by principles of increasing explanatory power.&lt;ref name="Brody 1993 44–45"&gt;{{harvnb|Brody |1993|pp= 44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=942"/&gt;

Since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them, and thus be able to explain more than previous ones, successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="Brody 1993 44–45"/&gt; For example, the theory of [[evolution]] explains the [[Biodiversity|diversity of life on Earth]], how species adapt to their environments, and many other patterns observed in the natural world;&lt;ref name="Hall08"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Hall |editor1-first = B.K. |editor2-last = Hallgrímsson |editor2-first = B. |title = Strickberger's Evolution |year = 2008 |edition = 4th |publisher = Jones &amp; Bartlett |isbn = 978-0763700669 |url = http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763700669/ |page = 762 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120628101715/http://www.jblearning.com/catalog/9780763700669/ |archivedate = 2012-06-28 |df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cracraft05"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last= Cracraft | editor1-first= J. | editor2-last= Donoghue | editor2-first= M.J. |title = Assembling the tree of life | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 592 | isbn = 978-0195172348 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=6lXTP0YU6_kC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Assembling+the+tree+of+life#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; its most recent major modification was unification with [[genetics]] to form the [[Extended evolutionary synthesis|modern evolutionary synthesis]]. In subsequent modifications, it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as [[biochemistry]] and [[molecular biology]].

===Beliefs and biases===
[[File:Jean Louis Théodore Géricault 001.jpg|thumb|Flying gallop as shown by this painting ([[Théodore Géricault]], 1821) is [[Falsifiability|falsified]]; see image below]]
[[File:The Horse in Motion high res.jpg|thumb|[[Sallie Gardner at a Gallop|Muybridge's photographs]] of ''The Horse in Motion,'' 1878, were used to answer the question whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time. This demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science.]]

Scientific methodology often directs that [[Hypothesis|hypotheses]] be tested in [[Scientific control|controlled]] conditions wherever possible. This is frequently possible in certain areas, such as in the biological sciences, and more difficult in other areas, such as in astronomy.

The practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance, and to a degree, personal bias. For example, pre-existing beliefs can alter the interpretation of results, as in [[confirmation bias]]; this is a [[heuristic]] that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief, even if another observer might disagree (in other words, people tend to observe what they expect to observe).

A historical example is the belief that the legs of a [[Horse gallop|galloping]] horse are splayed at the point when none of the horse's legs touches the ground, to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters. However, the first stop-action pictures of a horse's gallop by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] showed this to be false, and that the legs are instead gathered together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Needham|Wang|1954}} p. 166 shows how the 'flying gallop' image propagated from China to the West.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new, surprising statements (see [[appeal to novelty]]), which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true.&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=940"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=940}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic.&lt;ref&gt;"A myth is a belief given uncritical acceptance by members of a group ..." – Weiss, ''Business Ethics'' p. 15, as cited by Ronald R. Sims (2003) ''Ethics and corporate social responsibility: why giants fall'' p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldhaber and Nieto published in 2010 the observation that if theoretical structures with "many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts then the theoretical structure .. becomes increasingly hard to overturn".&lt;ref name="Goldhaber 2010 page=942"&gt;{{harvnb|Goldhaber|Nieto|2010|page=942}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe.&lt;ref&gt;[[Imre Lakatos]] (1976), ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]''. {{harvnb|Taleb|2007|p=72}} lists ways to avoid the narrative fallacy and confirmation bias.&lt;/ref&gt; For more on the [[narrative fallacy]], see also {{harvnb|Fleck|1979|p=27}}: "Words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them. ... Such proto-ideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized. ... Once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed, it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it." Sometimes, these have their elements assumed [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']], or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them. [[Donald M. MacKay]] has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement.&lt;ref&gt;
The scientific method requires testing and validation [[Empirical evidence|''a posteriori'']] before ideas are accepted. "Invariably one came up against fundamental physical limits to the accuracy of measurement. ... The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ... Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ... The first group of limits were calculable ''a priori'' from a specification of the instrument. The second group could be calculated only ''a posteriori'' from a specification of what was ''done'' with the instrument. ... In the first case each unit [of information] would add one additional ''dimension'' (conceptual category), whereas in the second each unit would add one additional ''atomic fact''.", pp. 1–4: MacKay, Donald M. (1969), ''Information, Mechanism, and Meaning'', Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, {{ISBN|026263032X}}

==Elements of the scientific method==
There are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry. The [[scientific community]] and [[philosophers of science]] generally agree on the following classification of method components. These methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of [[natural science]]s than [[social science]]s. Nonetheless, the cycle of formulating hypotheses, testing and analyzing the results, and formulating new hypotheses, will resemble the cycle described below.

The scientific method is an iterative, cyclical process through which information is continually revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Godfrey-Smith|first1=Peter|title=Theory and Reality: An Introduction to the Philosophy of Science|date=2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226300627|url=https://books.google.com/?id=k23egtSWrb8C}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brody|first1=Thomas A.|title=The Philosophy Behind Physics|date=1993|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Berlin; New York|isbn=978-3540559146|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zmHrCAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements, in varying combinations or contributions:&lt;ref name="Kuhn50"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kuhn|first1=Thomas S.|title=The Structure of Scientific Revolutions|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226458113|edition=50th Anniversary|url=https://books.google.com/books/aout/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions.html?id=3eP5Y_OOuzwC|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Galison"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Galison|first1=Peter|title=How Experiments End|date=1987|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|isbn=978-0226279152|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/How_Experiments_End.html?id=DN-9m2jSo8YC|accessdate=29 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Characterizations (observations, definitions, and measurements of the subject of inquiry)
* Hypotheses (theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject)
* Predictions (inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory)
* Experiments (tests of all of the above)

Each element of the scientific method is subject to [[peer review]] for possible mistakes. These activities do not describe all that scientists do ([[#Dimensions of practice|see below]]) but apply mostly to experimental sciences (e.g., physics, chemistry, and biology). The elements above are often taught in [[education|the educational system]] as "the scientific method".&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Inquiry-based learning|inquiry-based education]] paradigm, the stage of "characterization, observation, definition, ..." is more briefly summed up under the rubric of a Question&lt;/ref&gt;

The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity.&lt;ref&gt;"To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science." – {{harvnb|Einstein|Infeld|1938|p=92}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow,
but is rather an [[#Evaluation and improvement|ongoing cycle]], constantly developing more useful, accurate and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's ''Principia''. On the contrary, if the astronomically large, the vanishingly small, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work.

A linearized, pragmatic scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding:&lt;ref&gt;Crawford S, Stucki L (1990), "Peer review and the changing research record", "J Am Soc Info Science", vol. 41, pp. 223–28&lt;/ref&gt;

# Define a question
# Gather information and resources (observe)
# Form an explanatory hypothesis
# Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a [[Reproducibility|reproducible]] manner
# Analyze the data
# Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for new hypothesis
# Publish results
# Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

The iterative cycle inherent in this step-by-step method goes from point 3 to 6 back to 3 again.

While this schema outlines a typical hypothesis/testing method,&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', {{harvnb|Gauch|2003}}, esp. chapters 5–8&lt;/ref&gt; it should also be noted that a number of philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science, including [[Paul Feyerabend]], claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced.

===Characterizations===
The scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation. (The ''subjects'' can also be called [[:Category:Lists of unsolved problems|''unsolved problems'']] or the ''unknowns''.) For example, [[Benjamin Franklin]] conjectured, correctly, that [[St. Elmo's fire]] was [[electrical]] in [[nature]], but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects, careful thought may also [[logical consequence|entail]] some definitions and observations; the [[observations]] often demand careful [[measurements]] and/or counting.

The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between [[Pseudoscience|pseudo-sciences]], such as alchemy, and science, such as chemistry or biology. Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as [[correlation]] and [[regression analysis|regression]], performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations. The measurements often require specialized [[scientific instrument]]s such as [[thermometer]]s, [[Spectrometer|spectroscopes]], [[particle accelerator]]s, or [[voltmeter]]s, and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement.

{{Quotation|1=I am not accustomed to saying anything with certainty after only one or two observations.|2=[[Andreas Vesalius]]|4=(1546)&lt;ref&gt;
Andreas Vesalius, ''Epistola, Rationem, Modumque Propinandi Radicis Chynae Decocti'' (1546), 141. Quoted and translated in C.D. O'Malley, ''Andreas Vesalius of Brussels'', (1964), 116. As quoted by {{harvnb|Bynum|Porter|2005|p=597}}: Andreas Vesalius, 597#1.
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Uncertainty====
Measurements in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their [[uncertainty]]. The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to data collection limitations. Or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the sampling method used and the number of samples taken.

====Definition====
Measurements demand the use of ''[[operational definition]]s'' of relevant quantities. That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact or "idealized" definition. For example, [[electric current]], measured in amperes, may be operationally defined in terms of the mass of silver deposited in a certain time on an electrode in an electrochemical device that is described in some detail. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of "mass" ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a particular kilogram of platinum-iridium kept in a laboratory in France.

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its [[natural language]] usage. For example, [[mass]] and [[weight]] overlap in meaning in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in [[mechanics]]. Scientific quantities are often characterized by their [[units of measurement|units of measure]] which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work.

New theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined. For example, [[Albert Einstein]]'s first paper on [[Special relativity|relativity]] begins by defining [[Relativity of simultaneity|simultaneity]] and the means for determining [[length]]. These ideas were skipped over by [[Isaac Newton]] with, "I do not define [[time in physics#Galileo: the flow of time|time]], space, place and [[motion (physics)|motion]], as being well known to all." Einstein's paper then demonstrates that they (viz., absolute time and length independent of motion) were approximations. [[Francis Crick]] cautions us that when characterizing a subject, however, it can be premature to define something when it remains ill-understood.&lt;ref&gt;Crick, Francis (1994), ''The Astonishing Hypothesis'' {{ISBN|0684194317}} p. 20
&lt;/ref&gt; In Crick's study of [[consciousness]], he actually found it easier to study [[awareness]] in the [[visual system]], rather than to study [[free will]], for example. His cautionary example was the gene; the gene was much more poorly understood before Watson and Crick's pioneering discovery of the structure of DNA; it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene, before them.

====DNA-characterizations====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; The [[DNA#History of DNA research|history]] of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a classic example of [[#Elements of the scientific method|the elements of the scientific method]]: in 1950 it was known that [[genetic inheritance]] had a mathematical description, starting with the studies of [[Gregor Mendel]], and that DNA contained genetic information (Oswald Avery's ''transforming principle'').&lt;ref name="harvnb|McCarty1985"/&gt; But the mechanism of storing genetic information (i.e., genes) in DNA was unclear. Researchers in [[William Lawrence Bragg|Bragg's]] laboratory at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] made [[X-ray]] [[diffraction]] pictures of various [[molecule]]s, starting with [[crystal]]s of [[salt]], and proceeding to more complicated substances. Using clues painstakingly assembled over decades, beginning with its chemical composition, it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of DNA, and the X-ray images would be the vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific method#DNA-hypotheses|..''2. DNA-hypotheses'']]

====Another example: precession of Mercury====
[[File:Perihelio.svg|thumb|right|[[Apsidal precession|Precession]] of the [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] (exaggerated)]]

The characterization element can require extended and extensive study, even centuries. It took thousands of years of measurements, from the [[Chaldea]]n, [[India]]n, [[History of Iran|Persian]], [[Greece|Greek]], [[Arabs|Arabic]] and [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] astronomers, to fully record the motion of planet [[Earth]]. Newton was able to include those measurements into consequences of his [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]]. But the [[Perihelion and aphelion|perihelion]] of the planet [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s [[orbit]] exhibits a precession that cannot be fully explained by Newton's laws of motion (see diagram to the right), as Leverrier pointed out in 1859. The observed difference for Mercury's [[Apsidal precession|precession]] between Newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to [[Albert Einstein]] as a possible early test of his theory of [[General relativity]]. His relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than did Newtonian theory. The difference is approximately 43 arc-seconds per century.

===Hypothesis development===
{{Main article|Hypothesis formation}}

A [[hypothesis]] is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena.

Normally hypotheses have the form of a [[mathematical model]]. Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as [[existential quantification|existential statements]], stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [[universal quantification|universal statements]], stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, [[inductive reasoning]], [[Bayesian inference]], and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Albert Einstein once observed that "there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Einstein |first1=Albert |title=The World as I See It |date=1949 |publisher=Philosophical Library |location=New York |pages=24–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], borrowing a page from [[Aristotle]] (''[[Prior Analytics]]'', [[Inquiry#Abduction|2.25]]) described the incipient stages of [[inquiry]], instigated by the "irritation of doubt" to venture a plausible guess, as ''[[abductive reasoning]]''. The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a "flash of inspiration", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. [[Michael Polanyi]] made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology.

[[William Glen (geologist and historian)|William Glen]] observes that&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Glen|1994|pp=37–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{blockquote|the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived "truth", or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.}}

In general scientists tend to look for theories that are "[[Elegance|elegant]]" or "[[beauty|beautiful]]". In contrast to the usual English use of these terms, they here refer to a theory in accordance with the known facts, which is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. [[Occam's Razor]] serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.

To minimize the [[confirmation bias]] which results from entertaining a single hypothesis, [[strong inference]] emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Platt&gt;[[John R. Platt]] (16 October 1964) [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/146/3642/347 Strong Inference] ''Science'' vol '''146''' (3642) p. 347 {{doi|10.1126/science.146.3642.347}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA-hypotheses====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; [[Linus Pauling]] proposed that DNA might be a [[triple helix]].&lt;ref&gt;
"The structure that we propose is a three-chain structure, each chain being a helix" – Linus Pauling, as quoted on p. 157 by Horace Freeland Judson (1979), ''The Eighth Day of Creation'' {{ISBN|0671225405}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis was also considered by [[Francis Crick]] and [[James D. Watson]] but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|McElheny|2004|pp=49–50}}: January 28, 1953 – Watson read Pauling's pre-print, and realized that in Pauling's model, DNA's phosphate groups had to be un-ionized. But DNA is an acid, which contradicts Pauling's model.
&lt;/ref&gt; and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. So, the race was on to figure out the correct structure (except that Pauling did not realize at the time that he was in a race) ''[[#DNA-predictions|..3. DNA-predictions]]''

===Predictions from the hypothesis===
{{Main article|Prediction in science}}

Any useful hypothesis will enable [[prediction]]s, by [[reasoning]] including [[deductive reasoning]]. It might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature. The prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities.

It is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown. Only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true. If the outcome is already known, it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while [[Scientific method#Hypothesis development|formulating the hypothesis]].

If the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience, the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense. A new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible. For example, while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation, there is no known experiment that can test this hypothesis. Therefore, science itself can have little to say about the possibility. In future, a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science.

====DNA-predictions====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; [[James D. Watson]], [[Francis Crick]], and others hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure. This implied that DNA's X-ray diffraction pattern would be 'x shaped'.&lt;ref name="Crick pp. 137–138"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
June 1952. as noted in {{harvnb|McElheny|2004|p=43}}: Watson had succeeded in getting X-ray pictures of TMV showing a diffraction pattern consistent with the transform of a helix.
&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction followed from the work of Cochran, Crick and Vand&lt;ref name="HelixTransform"/&gt; (and independently by Stokes). The Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces x shaped patterns.

In their first paper, Watson and Crick also noted that the [[double helix]] structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for [[DNA replication]], writing, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 68: ''Nature'' April 25, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; [[#DNA-experiments|'' ..4. DNA-experiments'']]

====Another example: general relativity====
[[File:Gravitational lens-full.jpg|right|thumb|upright=0.9|[[gravitational lensing|Einstein's prediction (1907): Light bends in a gravitational field]]]]

Einstein's theory of [[General Relativity]] makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of [[space-time]], such as that [[light]] bends in a [[gravitational field]], and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field. [[Arthur Eddington]]'s observations made during a 1919 [[solar eclipse]] supported General Relativity rather than Newtonian [[gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;In March 1917, the [[Royal Astronomical Society]] announced that on May 29, 1919, the occasion of a [[total eclipse]] of the sun would afford favorable conditions for testing Einstein's [[General theory of relativity]]. One expedition, to [[Sobral, Ceará]], [[Brazil]], and Eddington's expedition to the island of [[Principe]] yielded a set of photographs, which, when compared to photographs taken at [[Sobral, Ceará|Sobral]] and at [[Greenwich Observatory]] showed that the deviation of light was measured to be 1.69 [[arc-second]]s, as compared to Einstein's desk prediction of 1.75 [[arc-second]]s. – Antonina Vallentin (1954), ''Einstein'', as quoted by Samuel Rapport and Helen Wright (1965), ''Physics'', New York: Washington Square Press, pp. 294–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Experiments===
{{Main article|Experiment}}

Once predictions are made, they can be sought by experiments. If the test results contradict the predictions, the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable. Sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed, when compared to a [[crucial experiment]]. If the experimental results confirm the predictions, then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct, but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to [[#Evaluation and improvement|further testing.]] The [[experimental control]] is a technique for dealing with observational error. This technique uses the contrast between multiple samples (or observations) under differing conditions to see what varies or what remains the same. We vary the conditions for each measurement, to help isolate what has changed. [[Mill's canons]] can then help us figure out what the important factor is.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Stuart Mill|Mill, John Stuart]], "A System of Logic", University Press of the Pacific, Honolulu, 2002, {{ISBN|1410202526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Factor analysis]] is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect.

Depending on the predictions, the experiments can have different shapes. It could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting, a [[double-blind]] study or an archaeological [[excavation (archaeology)|excavation]]. Even taking a plane from [[New York City|New York]] to [[Paris]] is an experiment which tests the [[aerodynamics|aerodynamical]] hypotheses used for constructing the plane.

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those conducting an experiment. Detailed record keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results, likely by others. Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of [[Hipparchus]] (190–120 BCE), when determining a value for the precession of the Earth, while [[Scientific control|controlled experiments]] can be seen in the works of [[Jābir ibn Hayyān]] (721–815 CE), [[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]] (853–929) and Alhazen (965–1039).&lt;ref&gt;[[Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī|al-Battani]], ''De Motu Stellarum'' [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translation from Arabic to Latin in 1116]], as cited by "Battani, al-" (c. 858–929) ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', 15th. ed. Al-Battani is known for his accurate observations at al-Raqqah in Syria, beginning in 877. His work includes measurement of the annual precession of the equinoxes.&lt;/ref&gt;

====DNA-experiments====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; Watson and Crick showed an initial (and incorrect) proposal for the structure of DNA to a team from Kings College – [[Rosalind Franklin]], [[Maurice Wilkins]], and [[Raymond Gosling]]. Franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content. Later Watson saw Franklin's detailed [[Photo 51|X-ray diffraction images]] which showed an [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/photo51/ X-shape] and was able to confirm the structure was helical.&lt;ref name="TeaTime"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Watson 1968 167"/&gt; This rekindled Watson and Crick's model building and led to the correct structure. [[Scientific method#DNA-characterizations|''..1. DNA-characterizations'']]

===Evaluation and improvement===
The scientific method is iterative. At any stage it is possible to refine its [[accuracy and precision]], so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject under consideration. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject.

Other scientists may start their own research and enter the process at any stage. They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions. Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction, and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else. Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility.

====DNA-iterations====
&lt;span style="vertical-align:-120%"&gt;[[File:DNA icon (25x25).png|left|link=|alt=]]&lt;/span&gt; After considerable fruitless experimentation, being discouraged by their superior from continuing, and numerous false starts,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 53: The weekend (January 31 – February 1) after seeing photo 51, Watson informed Bragg of the X-ray diffraction image of DNA in B form. Bragg gave them permission to restart their research on DNA (that is, model building).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 54: On Sunday February 8, 1953, Maurice Wilkes gave Watson and Crick permission to work on models, as Wilkes would not be building models until Franklin left DNA research.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 56: [[Jerry Donohue]], on sabbatical from Pauling's lab and visiting Cambridge, advises Watson that textbook form of the base pairs was incorrect for DNA base pairs; rather, the keto form of the base pairs should be used instead. This form allowed the bases' hydrogen bonds to pair 'unlike' with 'unlike', rather than to pair 'like' with 'like', as Watson was inclined to model, on the basis of the textbook statements. On February 27, 1953, Watson was convinced enough to make cardboard models of the nucleotides in their keto form.&lt;/ref&gt; Watson and Crick were able to infer the essential structure of [[DNA]] by concrete [[model (abstract)|modeling]] [[DNA#History of DNA research|of the physical shapes]] of the [[nucleotide]]s which comprise it.&lt;ref name="SameShape" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
"Suddenly I became aware that an [[adenine]]-[[thymine]] pair held together by two [[hydrogen bond]]s was identical in shape to a [[guanine]]-[[cytosine]] pair held together by at least two hydrogen bonds. ..." – {{harvnb|Watson|1968|pp=194–97}}.
* {{harvnb|McElheny|2004}} p. 57 Saturday, February 28, 1953, Watson tried 'like with like' and admitted these base pairs didn't have hydrogen bonds that line up. But after trying 'unlike with unlike', and getting [[Jerry Donohue]]'s approval, the base pairs turned out to be identical in shape (as Watson stated above in his 1968 ''Double Helix'' memoir quoted above). Watson now felt confident enough to inform Crick. (Of course, 'unlike with unlike' increases the number of possible [[codon]]s, if this scheme were a [[genetic code]].)
&lt;/ref&gt; They were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by [[Linus Pauling]] and by [[Rosalind Franklin]]'s X-ray diffraction images. [[Scientific method#DNA example|..''DNA Example'']]

===Confirmation===
Science is a social enterprise, and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed. Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community. Researchers have given their lives for this vision; [[Georg Wilhelm Richmann]] was killed by [[ball lightning]] (1753) when attempting to replicate the 1752 kite-flying experiment of [[Benjamin Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;

To protect against bad science and fraudulent data, government research-granting agencies such as the [[National Science Foundation]], and science journals, including ''Nature'' and ''Science'', have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before. [[Scientific data archiving]] can be done at a number of national archives in the U.S. or in the [[World Data Center]].

==Models of scientific inquiry==
{{Main article|Models of scientific inquiry}}

===Classical model===
The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from Aristotle,&lt;ref&gt;
[[Aristotle]], "[[Prior Analytics]]", [[Hugh Tredennick]] (trans.), pp. 181–531 in ''Aristotle, Volume&amp;nbsp;1'', [[Loeb Classical Library]], William Heinemann, London, 1938.
&lt;/ref&gt; who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [[abductive reasoning|abductive]], [[deductive reasoning|deductive]], and [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] [[inference]], and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [[analogy]].

===Hypothetico-deductive model===
The [[hypothetico-deductive model]] or method is a proposed description of scientific method. Here, predictions from the hypothesis are central: if you assume the hypothesis to be true, what consequences follow?

If subsequent empirical investigation does not demonstrate that these consequences or predictions correspond to the observable world, the hypothesis can be concluded to be false.

===Pragmatic model===
{{See also|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
In 1877,&lt;ref name=Fixation&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders |year=1877 |title=The Fixation of Belief |journal=Popular Science Monthly |volume=12 |pages=1–15 |wslink=The Fixation of Belief}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth ''per se'' but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a secure belief, belief being that on which one is prepared to act. He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or [[hyperbolic doubt]], which he held to be fruitless.&lt;ref name=Doubt&gt;"What one does not in the least doubt one should not pretend to doubt; but a man should train himself to doubt," said Peirce in a brief intellectual autobiography; see Ketner, Kenneth Laine (2009) "Charles Sanders Peirce: Interdisciplinary Scientist" in ''The Logic of Interdisciplinarity''). Peirce held that actual, genuine doubt originates externally, usually in surprise, but also that it is to be sought and cultivated, "provided only that it be the weighty and noble metal itself, and no counterfeit nor paper substitute"; in "Issues of Pragmaticism", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 4, pp. 481–99, see [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/484/mode/1up p. 484], and [https://archive.org/stream/monistquart15hegeuoft#page/491/mode/1up p. 491]. (Reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 438–63, see 443 and 451).&lt;/ref&gt; He outlined four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:
# The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. It goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can shine but tend to be transitory.&lt;ref&gt;But see [[Scientific method and religion]].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The method of authority – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lived, but it cannot operate thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn of other societies present and past.
# The method of the ''a priori'' – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in [[paradigm]]s and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
# The scientific method – the method wherein inquiry regards itself as [[Fallibilism|fallible]] and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that slow, stumbling [[wikt:ratiocination|ratiocination]] can be dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment in practical matters, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1898), "Philosophy and the Conduct of Life", Lecture 1 of the Cambridge (MA) Conferences Lectures, published in ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 616–48 in part and in ''Reasoning and the Logic of Things'', Ketner (ed., intro.) and Putnam (intro., comm.), pp. 105–22, reprinted in ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 27–41.&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.&lt;ref name=F.R.L.&gt;" ... in order to learn, one must desire to learn ..." – Peirce (1899), "F.R.L." [First Rule of Logic], ''Collected Papers'' v. 1, paragraphs 135–40, {{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |title=Eprint |accessdate=2012-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106071421/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/frl_99.htm |archivedate=January 6, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scientific method excels the others by being deliberately designed to arrive – eventually – at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth ''per se'' but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.&lt;ref name=Fixation/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vital&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, in paragraph 582, from 1898:
{{quote|... [rational] inquiry of every type, fully carried out, has the vital power of self-correction and of growth. This is a property so deeply saturating its inmost nature that it may truly be said that there is but one thing needful for learning the truth, and that is a hearty and active desire to learn what is true.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Peirce, rational inquiry implies presuppositions about truth and the real; to reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the real is discoverable and independent of our vagaries of opinion. In that vein he defined truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object and, pragmatically, not as actual consensus of some definite, finite community (such that to inquire would be to poll the experts), but instead as that final opinion which all investigators ''would'' reach sooner or later but still inevitably, if they were to push investigation far enough, even when they start from different points.&lt;ref name=How&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders |year=1877 |title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear |journal=Popular Science Monthly |volume=12 |pages=286–302 wslink==How to Make Our Ideas Clear}}&lt;/ref&gt; In tandem he defined the real as a true sign's object (be that object a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law), which is what it is independently of any finite community's opinion and, pragmatically, depends only on the final opinion destined in a sufficient investigation. That is a destination as far, or near, as the truth itself to you or me or the given finite community. Thus, his theory of inquiry boils down to "Do the science." Those conceptions of truth and the real involve the idea of a community both without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed) and capable of definite increase of knowledge.&lt;ref name=4Incapacities&gt;Peirce (1868), "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140–57. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 264–317, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 28–55, and elsewhere. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/conseq/cn-frame.htm ''Arisbe'' Eprint]&lt;/ref&gt; As inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle" since it depends on a standpoint that is, in a sense, unlimited.&lt;ref name=Chances&gt;Peirce (1878), "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'' v. 12, pp. 604–15, see pp. [https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/618/mode/1up 610–11] via ''Internet Archive''.

The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Paying special attention to the generation of explanations, Peirce outlined the scientific method as a coordination of three kinds of inference in a purposeful cycle aimed at settling doubts, as follows (in §III–IV in "A Neglected Argument"&lt;ref name=NA&gt;{{cite wikisource |last=Peirce |first=Charles Sanders|date=1908 |title=A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God |journal=Hibbert Journal |volume=7 |pages=90–112 |wslink=A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God}} with added notes. Reprinted with previously unpublished part, ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraphs 452–85, ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 434–50, and elsewhere.&lt;/ref&gt; except as otherwise noted):

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;''[[Abductive reasoning|Abduction]]'' (or ''retroduction''). Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, on the basis of tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea so as to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon. Oftenest, even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong. But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense, said Peirce, of the "facile and natural", as by [[Galileo]]'s natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and, without it, there is no hope of sufficiently expediting inquiry (often multi-generational) toward new truths.&lt;ref name=PAP&gt;Peirce (c. 1906), "PAP (Prolegomena for an Apology to Pragmatism)" (Manuscript 293, not the like-named article), ''The New Elements of Mathematics'' (NEM) 4:319–20, see first quote under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/abduction.html Abduction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its [[testability]]&lt;ref name=SuitableTest&gt;Peirce, Carnegie application (L75, 1902), ''New Elements of Mathematics'' v. 4, pp. 37–38: {{quote|For it is not sufficient that a hypothesis should be a justifiable one. Any hypothesis which explains the facts is justified critically. But among justifiable hypotheses we have to select that one which is suitable for being tested by experiment.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.&lt;ref name=econ&gt;Peirce (1902), Carnegie application, see MS L75.329330, from [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-08.htm#m27 Draft D] of Memoir 27:
{{quote|Consequently, to discover is simply to expedite an event that would occur sooner or later, if we had not troubled ourselves to make the discovery. Consequently, the art of discovery is purely a question of economics. The economics of research is, so far as logic is concerned, the leading doctrine with reference to the art of discovery. Consequently, the conduct of abduction, which is chiefly a question of heuretic and is the first question of heuretic, is to be governed by economical considerations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce calls [[Pragmaticism|his pragmatism]] "the logic of abduction".&lt;ref name=LogAbduc&gt;Peirce (1903), "Pragmatism – The Logic of Abduction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 195–205, especially 196. [http://www.textlog.de/7663.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; His [[pragmatic maxim]] is: "Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object".&lt;ref name=How /&gt; His pragmatism is a method of reducing conceptual confusions fruitfully by equating the meaning of any conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects – a method of experimentational mental reflection hospitable to forming hypotheses and conducive to testing them. It favors efficiency. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if uncostly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. A guess is intrinsically worth testing if it has instinctive plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [[Subjective probability|subjective likelihood]], though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as example the game of [[Twenty Questions]]), breadth, and incomplexity.&lt;ref name=20Qs&gt;Peirce, "On the Logic of Drawing Ancient History from Documents", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, see pp. 107–09. On Twenty Questions, p. 109: {{quote|Thus, twenty skillful hypotheses will ascertain what 200,000 stupid ones might fail to do.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; the economy of research is what demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.&lt;ref name=econ /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;''[[Deductive reasoning|Deduction]]''. Two stages:
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Explication. Unclearly premissed, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis in order to render its parts as clear as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Demonstration: Deductive Argumentation, [[Euclid]]ean in procedure. Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions, for induction to test, about evidence to be found. [[Corollary|Corollarial]] or, if needed, theorematic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;''[[Inductive reasoning|Induction]]''. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning in general&lt;ref name=How /&gt;) that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which adequate investigation would lead;&lt;ref name=ProbInduc&gt;Peirce (1878), "The Probability of Induction", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 705–18, see [https://books.google.com/?id=ZKMVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 718] ''Google Books''; [https://archive.org/stream/popscimonthly12yoummiss#page/728/mode/1up 718] via ''Internet Archive''. Reprinted often, including (''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 669–93), (''The Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 155–69).&lt;/ref&gt; anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real. Induction involving ongoing tests or observations follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree. Three stages:
&lt;ol type="i"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Classification. Unclearly premissed, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Probation: direct inductive argumentation. Crude (the enumeration of instances) or gradual (new estimate of proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test). Gradual induction is qualitative or quantitative; if qualitative, then dependent on [[weighting]]s of qualities or characters;&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1905 draft "G" of "A Neglected Argument"), "Crude, Quantitative, and Qualitative Induction", ''Collected Papers'' v. 2, paragraphs 755–60, see 759. Find under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/induction.html Induction]" at ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; if quantitative, then dependent on measurements, [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Probability and statistics|or on statistics]], or on countings.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sentential Induction. "...which, by inductive reasonings, appraises the different probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

==Science of complex systems==
Science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as [[transdisciplinarity]], [[systems theory]] and [[scientific modelling]]. The [[Santa Fe Institute]] studies such systems;&lt;ref name=Crutchfield&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csc.ucdavis.edu/~chaos/chaos/talks/CSTheorySFIRetreat.pdf|title=James  (2003) "Complex Systems Theory?"|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Gell-Mann]] interconnects these topics with [[message passing]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://physicstoday.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2808634 Review of ''The Quark and the Jaguar'', by Murray Gell-Mann (1994)]
* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGSXGMpA0pY Murray Gell-Mann, "What the ''Quark and Jaguar'' is about" – Youtube clip]&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse, interconnected systems and large data sets. In particular, practices used within [[Big data]], such as [[predictive analytics]], may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Chris (2008) [http://www.uvm.edu/~pdodds/files/papers/others/2008/anderson2008a.pdf The End of Theory: The Data Deluge Makes the Scientiﬁc Method Obsolete]. Wired Magazine 16.07&lt;/ref&gt;

==Communication and community==
{{see also|Scientific community|Scholarly communication}}

Frequently the scientific method is employed not only by a single person, but also by several people cooperating directly or indirectly. Such cooperation can be regarded as an important element of a [[scientific community]]. Various standards of scientific methodology are used within such an environment.

===Peer review evaluation===
Scientific journals use a process of ''[[peer review]]'', in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three, and usually anonymous) fellow scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. In certain journals, the journal itself selects the referees; while in others (especially journals that are extremely specialized), the manuscript author might recommend referees. The referees may or may not recommend publication, or they might recommend publication with suggested modifications, or sometimes, publication in another journal. This standard is practiced to various degrees by different journals, and can have the effect of keeping the literature free of obvious errors and to generally improve the quality of the material, especially in the journals who use the standard most rigorously. The peer review process can have limitations when considering research outside the conventional scientific paradigm: problems of "[[groupthink]]" can interfere with open and fair deliberation of some new research.&lt;ref&gt;. Brown, C. (2005) Overcoming Barriers to Use of Promising Research Among Elite Middle East Policy Groups, Journal of Social Behaviour and Personality, Select Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Documentation and replication===
{{Main article|Reproducibility}}
Sometimes experimenters may make systematic errors during their experiments, veer from standard methods and practices ([[Pathological science]]) for various reasons, or, in rare cases, deliberately report false results. Occasionally because of this then, other scientists might attempt to repeat the experiments in order to duplicate the results.

====Archiving====
Researchers sometimes practice [[scientific data archiving]], such as in compliance with the policies of government funding agencies and scientific journals. In these cases, detailed records of their experimental procedures, raw data, statistical analyses and source code can be preserved in order to provide evidence of the methodology and practice of the procedure and assist in any potential future attempts to [[Reproducibility|reproduce the result]]. These procedural records may also assist in the conception of new experiments to test the hypothesis, and may prove useful to engineers who might examine the potential practical applications of a discovery.

====Data sharing====
When additional information is needed before a study can be reproduced, the author of the study might be asked to provide it. They might provide it, or if the author refuses to [[data sharing|share data]], appeals can be made to the journal editors who published the study or to the institution which funded the research.

====Limitations====
Since it is impossible for a scientist to record ''everything'' that took place in an experiment, facts selected for their apparent relevance are reported. This may lead, unavoidably, to problems later if some supposedly irrelevant feature is questioned. For example, [[Heinrich Hertz]] did not report the size of the room used to test Maxwell's equations, which later turned out to account for a small deviation in the results. The problem is that parts of the theory itself need to be assumed in order to select and report the experimental conditions. The observations are hence sometimes described as being 'theory-laden'.

===Dimensions of practice===
{{Further information|Rhetoric of science}}

The primary constraints on contemporary science are:
* Publication, i.e. [[Peer review]]
* Resources (mostly funding)
It has not always been like this: in the old days of the "[[gentleman scientist]]" funding (and to a lesser extent publication) were far weaker constraints.

Both of these constraints indirectly require scientific method – work that violates the constraints will be difficult to publish and difficult to get funded. Journals require submitted papers to conform to "good scientific practice" and to a degree this can be enforced by peer review. Originality, importance and interest are more important – see for example the [http://www.nature.com/nature/submit/get_published/index.html author guidelines] for [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']].

Smaldino and McElreath 2016 have noted that our need to reward scientific understanding is being nullified by poor research design and poor data analysis, which is leading to false-positive findings.&lt;ref name=Smaldino2016&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The natural selection of bad science|journal = R.

==Philosophy and sociology of science==
{{See also|Philosophy of science|Sociology of science}}

Philosophy of science looks at the underpinning logic of the scientific method, at what separates [[Demarcation problem|science from non-science]], and the [[Research ethics|ethic]] that is implicit in science. There are basic assumptions, derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist, that form the base of the scientific method – namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert (1936, 1956) One may say "the eternal mystery of the world is its comprehensibility." From the article "Physics and Reality" (1936), reprinted in ''Out of My Later Years'' (1956). 'It is one of the great realizations of Immanuel Kant that the setting up of a real external world would be senseless without this comprehensibility.'&lt;/ref&gt; These assumptions from [[naturalism (philosophy)|methodological naturalism]] form a basis on which science may be grounded. [[Logical positivism|Logical Positivist]], [[empiricism|empiricist]], [[falsifiability|falsificationist]], and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science, but each has also itself been criticized. More generally, the scientific method can be recognized as an idealization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Thomas Kuhn]] examined the history of science in his ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'', and found that the actual method used by scientists differed dramatically from the then-espoused method. His observations of science practice are essentially sociological and do not speak to how science is or can be practiced in other times and other cultures.

[[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Thomas Kuhn]] have done extensive work on the "theory laden" character of observation. Hanson (1958) first coined the term for the idea that all observation is dependent on [[Situated cognition|the conceptual framework of the observer]], using the concept of [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Kuhn&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuhn|1962|p=113}}
{{ISBN|978-1443255448}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and Feyerabend&lt;ref&gt;Feyerabend, Paul K (1960) "Patterns of Discovery" The Philosophical Review (1960) vol. 69 (2) pp. 247–52&lt;/ref&gt; acknowledge the pioneering significance of his work.

Kuhn (1961) said the scientist generally has a theory in mind before designing and undertaking experiments so as to make empirical observations, and that the "route from theory to measurement can almost never be traveled backward". This implies that the way in which theory is tested is dictated by the nature of the theory itself, which led Kuhn (1961, p.&amp;nbsp;166) to argue that "once it has been adopted by a profession ... no theory is recognized to be testable by any quantitative tests that it has not already passed".&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn|Kuhn, Thomas S.]], "The Function of Measurement in Modern Physical Science", ''ISIS'' 52(2), 161–93, 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Paul Feyerabend]] similarly examined the history of science, and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process. In his book ''[[Against Method]]'' he argues that scientific progress is ''not'' the result of applying any particular method. In essence, he says that for any specific method or norm of science, one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science. Thus, if believers in scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule, Feyerabend jokingly suggests, it should be 'anything goes'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend, Paul K.]], ''Against Method, Outline of an Anarchistic Theory of Knowledge'', 1st published, 1975. Reprinted, Verso, London, 1978.
&lt;/ref&gt; Criticisms such as his led to the [[strong programme]], a radical approach to the [[sociology of science]].

The [[postmodernism|postmodernist]] critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy. This ongoing debate, known as the [[science wars]], is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between the postmodernist and [[Scientific realism|realist]] camps. Whereas postmodernists assert that scientific knowledge is simply another discourse (note that this term has special meaning in this context) and not representative of any form of fundamental truth, [[Scientific realism|realists]] in the scientific community maintain that scientific knowledge does reveal real and fundamental truths about reality. Many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate method of deriving truth.&lt;ref&gt;

===Role of chance in discovery===
{{Main article|Role of chance in scientific discoveries}}
Somewhere between 33% and 50% of all scientific discoveries are estimated to have been ''stumbled upon'', rather than sought out. This may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky.&lt;ref name=DunbarLuck&gt;Dunbar, K., &amp; Fugelsang, J. (2005). Causal thinking in science: How scientists and students interpret the unexpected. In M.E. Gorman, R.D. Tweney, D. Gooding &amp; A. Kincannon (Eds.), Scientific and Technical Thinking (pp. 57–79). Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Pasteur]] is credited with the famous saying that "Luck favours the prepared mind", but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be 'prepared for luck' in the scientific context. Research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected.'''&lt;ref name="DunbarLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"&gt;Oliver, J.E. (1991) Ch2. of The incomplete guide to the art of discovery. New York: Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;''' This is what [[Nassim Nicholas Taleb]] calls "Anti-fragility"; while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of [[human error]], human bias, and randomness, the scientific method is more than resistant or tough – it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways (it is anti-fragile). Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.&lt;ref name=Anti-fragility&gt;[http://www.edge.org/q2011/q11_3.html Taleb contributes a brief description of anti-fragility]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Kevin Dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments. These unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they ''think'' is an error in their method. Eventually, the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. The highly controlled, cautious and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors. At this point, the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise.&lt;ref name="DunbarLuck"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Oliver, J.E. 1991"/&gt;

==Relationship with mathematics==
Science is the process of gathering, comparing, and evaluating proposed models against [[observable]]s. A model can be a simulation, mathematical or chemical formula, or set of proposed steps. Science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is ''known'' from what is ''unknown'' at each stage of discovery. Models, in both science and mathematics, need to be internally consistent and also ought to be ''[[falsifiable]]'' (capable of disproof). In mathematics, a statement need not yet be proven; at such a stage, that statement would be called a [[conjecture]]. But when a statement has attained mathematical proof, that statement gains a kind of immortality which is highly prized by mathematicians, and for which some mathematicians devote their lives.&lt;ref&gt;
"When we are working intensively, we feel keenly the progress of our work; we are elated when our progress is rapid, we are depressed when it is slow." – the mathematician {{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=131}} in the section on 'Modern [[heuristic]]'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other.&lt;ref&gt;
"Philosophy [i.e., physics] is written in this grand book – I mean the universe – which stands continually open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language and interpret the characters in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics, and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometrical figures, without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it; without these, one is wandering around in a dark labyrinth." – Galileo Galilei, ''Il Saggiatore'' (''[[The Assayer]]'', 1623), as translated by [[Stillman Drake]] (1957), ''Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo'' pp. 237–38,
as quoted by {{harvnb|di Francia|1981|p=10}}.
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the technical concept of [[time]] arose in [[science]], and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic. But today, the [[Poincaré conjecture]] has been proven using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow (see [[Ricci flow]]).

Nevertheless, the connection between mathematics and reality (and so science to the extent it describes reality) remains obscure. [[Eugene Wigner]]'s paper, ''[[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences]]'', is a very well known account of the issue from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. In fact, some observers (including some well known mathematicians such as [[Gregory Chaitin]], and others such as [[Where Mathematics Comes From|Lakoff and Núñez]]) have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation (including cultural ones), somewhat like the post-modernist view of science.

[[George Pólya]]'s work on [[problem solving]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957}} 2nd ed.
&lt;/ref&gt; the construction of mathematical [[Mathematical proof|proofs]], and [[heuristic]]&lt;ref&gt;
George Pólya (1954), ''Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning Volume I: Induction and Analogy in Mathematics'',
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
George Pólya (1954), ''Mathematics and Plausible Reasoning Volume II: Patterns of Plausible Reasoning''.

&lt;/ref&gt; show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail, while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps.

In Pólya's view, ''understanding'' involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words, resorting to geometrical figures, and questioning what we know and do not know already; ''analysis'', which Pólya takes from [[Pappus of Alexandria|Pappus]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=142}}
&lt;/ref&gt; involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments, [[working backward from the goal]], and devising a plan for constructing the proof; ''synthesis'' is the strict [[Euclid]]ean exposition of step-by-step details&lt;ref&gt;
{{harvnb|Pólya|1957|p=144}}
&lt;/ref&gt; of the proof; ''review'' involves reconsidering and re-examining the result and the path taken to it.

[[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]], when asked how he came about his [[theorem]]s, once replied "durch planmässiges Tattonieren" (through [[Constructivism (mathematics)|systematic palpable experimentation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mackay|1991}} p. 100&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Imre Lakatos]] argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction, criticism and revision as principles for improving their work.&lt;ref&gt;See the development, by generations of mathematicians, of [[Euler's formula for polyhedra]] as documented by {{Citation|first=Imre| last=Lakatos|year=1976|title=Proofs and refutations|authorlink=Imre Lakatos |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0521290388| title-link=Proofs and refutations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In like manner to science, where truth is sought, but certainty is not found, in ''Proofs and refutations'' (1976), what Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of [[informal mathematics]] is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no [[counterexample]] has yet been found. Once a counterexample, i.e. an entity contradicting/not explained by the theorem is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (If axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, however, Lakatos claimed that proofs from those [[axiom]]s were [[Tautology (logic)|tautological]], i.e. [[logical truth|logically true]], by [[string rewriting system|rewriting]] them, as did Poincaré (''Proofs and Refutations'', 1976).)

Lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on Polya's idea of [[heuristic]]s. In ''Proofs and Refutations'', Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical '[[thought experiment]]s' are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs.&lt;ref&gt;Lakatos, Imre (Worrall &amp; Zahar, eds. 1976) ''[[Proofs and Refutations]]'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationship with statistics ===

The scientific method has been extremely successful in bringing the world out of medieval thinking, especially once it was combined with industrial processes.&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Nathan; Luther Earle Birdzell; Mitchell, Glenn William. ''How the West grew Rich''. Popular Prakashan, 1986. [http://vedpuriswar.org/Book_Review/Economics/How%20the%20West%20grew%20rich.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the scientific method employs statistics as part of its arsenal, there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods. This is described in a popular 2005 scientific paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False" by [[John Ioannidis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Why Most Published Research Findings Are False|journal = PLoS Medicine|date = 2005-08-01|issn = 1549-1277|pmc = 1182327|pmid = 16060722|volume = 2|issue = 8|pages = e124|doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124|first = John P.A.|last = Ioannidis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The particular points raised are statistical ("The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.") and economical ("The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true.") Hence: "Most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields" and "As shown, the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre- and poststudy probability for true findings." However: "Nevertheless, most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesis-generating research with low or very low pre-study odds," which means that *new* discoveries will come from research that, when that research started, had low or very low odds (a low or very low chance) of succeeding. Hence, if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge, research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield most new discoveries.

The stimulation triggers rhythmic, involuntary contractions in smooth muscle in the male reproductive tract, especially the vas deferens and the prostate.

Per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, "Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading."--&gt;

''Sexual intercourse'' may be called ''coitus'', ''copulation'', ''coition'', or ''intercourse'' (the last of which is typically shorthand for ''sexual intercourse''). ''Coitus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''coitio'' or ''coire'', meaning "a coming together or joining together" or "to go together", and is known under different ancient Latin names for a variety of sexual activities, but usually denotes penile–vaginal penetration.&lt;ref name="Coitus"&gt;

===Bonding===
{{See also|Human mating strategies|Pair bond}}
Copulation ranges from a purely reproductive activity to one of emotional bonding. For example, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general often play a strong role in [[human bonding]].&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of [[birth control]] (contraception), sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

In humans and [[bonobo]]s, the female undergoes relatively [[concealed ovulation]] so that male and female partners commonly do not know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One possible reason for this distinct biological feature may be formation of strong emotional bonds between sexual partners important for social interactions and, in the case of humans, long-term partnership rather than immediate sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reis"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Harry T.

The resulting cooperation encourages collective tasks that promote the survival of each member of the group.&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt;

===Stimulation===
Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity can encompass various [[sexually stimulating]] factors ([[Stimulus (physiology)|physiological stimulation]] or [[Stimulus (psychology)|psychological stimulation]]), including different [[sex position]]s or the use of [[sex toy]]s.&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taormino |first=Tristan |authorlink=Tristan Taormino |title=The Big Book of Sex Toys|publisher=Quiver|year=2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2014|page=52|isbn=978-1-59233-355-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hfly-iMkWRkC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreplay may precede some sexual activities, often leading to [[sexual arousal]] of the partners and resulting in the erection of the [[Human penis|penis]] or [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] of the [[vagina]].&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011|pages=384–386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT421 |author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S.

In most mammals, the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation. Copulation corresponds to a succession of [[Instinct|innate]] sexual reflexes: [[erection]], vaginal lubrication, [[lordosis behavior]], immobilization, intromission, [[pelvic thrust]] and [[ejaculation]]. These copulatory [[Reflex arc|reflexes]] are controlled by [[hormone]]s and facilitated by sexual [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="Plant"&gt;Plant T., Zeleznik A. (2015).

Oral sex consists of all the sexual activities that involve the use of the mouth and throat to stimulate [[Sex organ|genitalia]] or anus.

===={{anchor|sexarche}}Age at first intercourse====
The prevalence of sexual intercourse has been compared cross-culturally. In 2003, Michael Bozon of the French [[Institut national d'études démographiques]] conducted a cross-cultural study titled "At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?" In the first group of the contemporary cultures he studied, which included [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (listing [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ethiopia]]), the data indicated that the age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital; the study considered the [[Indian subcontinent]] to also fall into this group, though data was only available from [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bozon |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?

In the second group, the data indicated families encouraged daughters to delay marriage, and to abstain from sexual activity before that time. However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes before marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women; this group includes Latin cultures, both from [[southern Europe]] (Portugal, Greece and Romania are noted) and from [[Latin America]] (Brazil, [[Chile]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]). The study considered many Asian societies to also fall into this group, although matching data was only available from [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched; there were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries (Poland and [[Lithuania]] are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The study considered China and Vietnam to also fall into this group, though data were not available.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt; In northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual intercourse before any union formation; the study listed Switzerland, Germany and the Czech Republic as members of this group.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[Parasitism|parasites]], which are passed from person to person during sexual contact, especially penetrative sexual intercourse. Some, in particular [[HIV]] and syphilis, can also be passed in other ways, including from mother to child during pregnancy and [[childbirth]], through [[blood product]]s, and by shared [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)|publisher=World Health Organization

Untreated chlamydia infection can lead to female infertility and [[ectopic pregnancy]]. [[Human papillomavirus]] can lead to genital and [[cervical cancer]]s. [[Syphilis]] can result in [[stillbirth]]s and neonatal deaths. Untreated gonococcal infections result in [[miscarriage]]s, [[preterm birth]]s and [[Perinatal mortality|perinatal deaths]]. Infants born to mothers with untreated [[gonorrhea]] or chlamydia can develop [[neonatal conjunctivitis]] (a serious eye infection), which can lead to blindness.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015"/&gt; [[Hepatitis B]] can also be transmitted through sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis/HBV/HBVfaq.htm#treatment CDC Hepatitis B Information for Health Professionals] Accessed May 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, there are about 350 million chronic carriers of hepatitis B.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hepatitis B|url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/hepatitis/whocdscsrlyo20022/en/index1.html|publisher=[[World Health Organization]]|accessdate=September 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where infection is suspected, early medical intervention is highly beneficial in all cases. The CDC stated "the risk of HIV transmission from an infected partner through oral sex is much less than the risk of HIV transmission from anal or vaginal sex," but that "measuring the exact risk of HIV transmission as a result of oral sex is very difficult" and that this is "because most sexually active individuals practice oral sex in addition to other forms of sex, such as vaginal and/or anal sex, when transmission occurs, it is difficult to determine whether or not it occurred as a result of oral sex or other more risky sexual activities". They added that "several co-factors may increase the risk of HIV transmission through oral sex"; this includes ulcers, [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]], genital sores, and the presence of other STIs.&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt;

In 2005, the World Health Organization estimated that 123 million women become pregnant worldwide each year, and around 87 million of those pregnancies or 70.7% are unintentional.

In 1991, scholars from the Kinsey Institute stated, "The truth is that the time between penetration and ejaculation varies not only from man to man, but from one time to the next for the same man." They added that the appropriate length for sexual intercourse is the length of time it takes for both partners to be mutually satisfied, emphasizing that [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] "found that 75 percent of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration. But he didn't ask if the men or their partners considered two minutes mutually satisfying" and "more recent research reports slightly longer times for intercourse".&lt;ref name="Reinisch"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Kinsey Institute New Report On Sex| publisher = [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | year = 1991 | pages = 129–130| accessdate = August 30, 2012 |isbn = 0312063865| url = https://books.google.com/?id=KsW6wPiXEd0C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129 |author1=June M.

[[Vaginismus]] is involuntary tensing of the pelvic floor musculature, making coitus, or any form of penetration of the vagina, distressing, painful and sometimes impossible for women. It is a conditioned reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, and is sometimes referred to as the ''PC muscle.'' Vaginismus can be hard to overcome because if a woman expects to experience pain during sexual intercourse, this can cause a muscle spasm, which results in painful sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Weiner2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ferri"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred F.

The [[mentally disabled]] also are subject to challenges in participating in sexual intercourse. Women with Intellectual disabilities (ID) are often presented with situations that prevent sexual intercourse. This can include the lack of a knowledgeable healthcare provider trained and experienced in counseling those with ID on sexual intercourse.  Those with ID may have hesitations regarding the discussion of the topic of sex, a lack of sexual knowledge and limited opportunities for sex education.  In addition there are other barriers such as a higher prevalence of sexual abuse and assault.  These crimes often remain underreported.  There remains a lack of "dialogue around this population's human right to consensual sexual expression, undertreatment of menstrual disorders, and legal and systemic barriers". Women with ID may lack sexual health care and sex education.  They may not recognize sexual abuse. Consensual sexual intercourse is not always an option for some.  Those with ID may have limited knowledge and access to contraception, screening for sexually transmitted infections and cervical cancer.&lt;ref name="GreenwoodWilkinson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenwood|first1=Nechama W.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Joanne|title=Sexual and Reproductive Health Care for Women with Intellectual Disabilities: A Primary Care Perspective|journal=International Journal of Family Medicine|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=1–8|issn=2090-2042|doi=10.1155/2013/642472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social effects==

===Adults===
Some researchers, such as [[Alex Comfort]], posit three potential advantages or social effects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive; these are reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comfort"&gt;{{cite book|last=Comfort|first=Alex|authorlink = Alex Comfort|title = The New Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking | publisher = Diane Publishing Company | year = 1991 | pages = 253 pages| accessdate = August 16, 2013 |isbn = 0756783526| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nfijPQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the development of the birth control pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid to late 20th century increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, they still significantly overlap and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have sexual intercourse while contracepting not only to experience sexual pleasure (recreational), but also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This couple may emphasize different aspects of sexual intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of sexual intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).&lt;ref name="Comfort"/&gt;

For women, there is often a complaint about the lack of their spouses' sexual spontaneity.

Research additionally indicates that non-married couples who are [[cohabiting]] engage in sexual intercourse more often than married couples, and are more likely to participate in sexual activity outside of their sexual relationships; this may be due to the "[[honeymoon]]" effect (the newness or novelty of sexual intercourse with the partner), since sexual intercourse is usually practiced less the longer a couple is married, with couples engaging in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity once or twice a week, or approximately six to seven times a month.&lt;ref name="Strong2"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bryan Strong| author2 = Theodore Cohen|title =The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationships in a Changing Society|publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2013 | page = 212 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn =1285531892| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZIWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT237}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in older age]] also affects the frequency of sexual intercourse, as older people generally engage in sexual intercourse less frequently than younger people do.&lt;ref name="Strong2"/&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{Main|Adolescent sexuality}}
Adolescents commonly use sexual intercourse for relational and recreational purposes, which may negatively or positively impact their lives. For example, while [[teenage pregnancy]] may be welcomed in some cultures, it is also commonly disparaged, and research suggests that the [[Precocious puberty|earlier onset of puberty]] for children puts pressure on children and teenagers to act like adults before they are emotionally or cognitively ready.&lt;ref name="sex lives3"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sex Lives of Teenagers| isbn=978-0-452-28260-5| last=Ponton| first=Lynn|authorlink=Lynn Ponton| year=2000| page=3| publisher=[[Dutton Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have concluded that engaging in sexual intercourse leaves adolescents, especially girls, with higher levels of stress and depression, and that girls may be likelier to engage in sexual risk (such as sexual intercourse without the use of a condom),&lt;ref name="DiClemente"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ralph J.

Some studies from the 1970s through 1990s suggested an association between [[self-esteem]] and sexual intercourse among adolescents,&lt;ref name="Lerner 2"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Richard M. | last1 = Lerner | first2 = Daniel F. | last2 = Perkins | name-list-format = vanc |title = Social Interactions in Adolescence and Promoting Positive Social Contributions of Youth| publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 1999 | page = 124| accessdate = April 14, 2017 |isbn = 0815332955| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BunEIQylaJAC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies, from the 1980s and 1990s, reported that the research generally indicates little or no relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity among adolescents.&lt;ref name=" Kowalski"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kowalski RM, Leary MR |title =The Interface of Social and Clinical Psychology: Key Readings| publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | year = 2004 | page = 121| accessdate = April 14, 2017 |isbn = 1841690872| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=qkEdaQ4heGgC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, the evidence mostly supported the latter,&lt;ref name="Kowalski"/&gt; and further research has supported little or no relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity among adolescents.&lt;ref name="Guindon"&gt;{{cite book| author =Mary H.

Psychiatrist [[Lynn Ponton]] wrote, "All adolescents have sex lives, whether they are sexually active with others, with themselves, or seemingly not at all", and that viewing adolescent sexuality as a potentially positive experience, rather than as something inherently dangerous, may help young people develop healthier patterns and make more positive choices regarding sexual activity.&lt;ref name="sex lives3" /&gt; Researchers state that long-term romantic relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen S., Collins W.

[[File:Erotic scenes Louvre G13 n4.jpg|thumb|Erotic painting on ancient Greek [[kylix]]]]
While sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to [[religion and sexuality|religious]] and governmental laws. Some governments and religions also have strict designations of "appropriate" and "inappropriate" sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible. A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;William N. Eskridge Jr. Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America, 1861–2003.

===Sexual offenses===
Sexual intercourse with a person against their will, or without their [[Consent#Sexual activity|consent]], is [[rape]], but may also be called ''[[sexual assault]]''; it is considered a serious [[criminal law|crime]] in most countries.&lt;ref name="Sex and Society"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marshall Cavendish Corporation | title = Sex and Society | publisher = [[Marshall Cavendish|Marshall Cavendish Corporation]] | year = 2010 | pages = 143–144 | accessdate = August 25, 2013|isbn = 0-7614-7906-6|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=aVDZchwkIMEC&amp;lpg=PA143}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Greenberg2"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jerrold S.

Most countries have [[age of consent]] laws which set the minimum legal age with whom an older person may engage in sexual intercourse, usually set at 16 to 18, but ranges from 12 to 20, years of age. In some societies, an age of consent is set by non-statutory custom or tradition.&lt;ref name="Kinnear"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen L.

Some countries treat any sex with a person of diminished or insufficient mental capacity to give consent, regardless of age, as rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reed|first=E.

[[File:Slevogt Faun and a Girl.jpg .jpg|thumb|left|[[Max Slevogt]] depiction of rape]]
Robert Francoeur et al. stated that "prior to the 1970s, rape definitions of sex often included only penile-vaginal sexual intercourse."&lt;ref name="Francoeur"&gt;{{cite book | title = The Continuum Complete International Encyclopedia of Sexuality | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group]] | year = 2004 | page = 173 | accessdate = April 30, 2013|isbn = 0826414885| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=PQMTzc6y8ZAC&amp;pg=PA173 | first1 = Robert T. | last1 = Francoeur | first2 = Raymond J. | last2 = Noonan | first3 = Beldina | last3 = Opiyo-Omolo | name-list-format = vanc }}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors Pamela J. Kalbfleisch and Michael J. Cody stated that this made it so that if "sex means penile-vaginal intercourse, then rape means forced penile-vaginal intercourse, and other sexual behaviors&amp;nbsp;– such as fondling a person's genitals without her or his consent, forced oral sex, and same-sex coercion&amp;nbsp;– are not considered rape"; they stated that "although some other forms of forced sexual contact are included within the legal category of sodomy (e.g., anal penetration and oral-genital contact), many unwanted sexual contacts have no legal grounding as rape in some states".&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch"/&gt; Ken Plumber argued that the legal meaning "of rape in most countries is unlawful sexual intercourse which means the penis must penetrate the vagina" and that "other forms of sexual violence towards women such as forced oral sex or anal intercourse, or the insertion of other objects into the vagina, constitute the 'less serious' crime of sexual assault".&lt;ref name="Plummer"/&gt;

Over time, the meaning of rape broadened in some parts of the world to include many types of sexual penetration, including anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and penetration of the genitals or rectum by an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; Until 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) still considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed the meaning from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The meaning does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level, but instead assures that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |title=An Updated Definition of Rape (U.S. Dept of Justice, January 6, 2012) |publisher= |accessdate=October 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313021145/http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html|title=U.S. to Expand Rape Definition in Crime Statistics (New York Times, January 6, 2012)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, penetration is not required for the act to be categorized as rape.&lt;ref name="Book04"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Merril D. |title=Encyclopedia of rape |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-32687-5 |pages=169–170 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most societies around the world, the concept of [[incest]] exists and is criminalized. James Roffee, a senior lecturer in criminology at [[Monash University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee(896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0).html|title=Dr James Roffee|publisher=Monash university|access-date=May 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204003059/http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee%28896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0%29.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed potential harm associated with familial sexual activity, such as resulting children born with deficiencies. However, the law is more concerned with protecting the rights of people who are potentially subjected to such abuse. This is why familial sexual relationships are criminalized, even if all parties are consensual. There are laws prohibiting all kinds of sexual activity between relatives, not necessarily penetrative sex. These laws refer to grandparents, parents, children, siblings, aunts and uncles. There are differences between states in terms of the severity of punishments and what they consider to be a relative, including biological parents, step-parents, adoptive parents and half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023]|title=Roffee, J.

====Marriage and relationships====
Sexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring [[consummation]] of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation).&lt;!-- NOTE: This is also sourced in the bullet-point examples list below.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;{{cite book| author =Margaret Monahan Hogan|title =Marriage as a Relationship: Real and Rational|publisher = [[Marquette University Press]] | year = 2002 | page = 88 | accessdate = September 1, 2015 |isbn = 0874626579| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=HuztAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Marriage+as+a+Relationship:+Real+and+Rational}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for [[annulment]] (which does not require a divorce process).

There are various legal positions regarding the meaning and legality of sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex or gender. For example, in the 2003 [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] case [[Blanchflower v. Blanchflower]], it was held that female same-sex sexual relations, and same-sex sexual practices in general, did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 entry in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' that categorizes sexual intercourse as coitus; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case was found not guilty of [[adultery]].&lt;ref name="GLAD, B vs. B"&gt;{{cite web| title=Blanchflower v.

* In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], or [[Mormonism]], sexual relations within the bonds of matrimony are seen as sacred. Mormons consider sexual relations to be ordained of God for the creation of children and for the expression of love between husband and wife.

In Shi'ia Islam, men are allowed to enter into an unlimited number of temporary marriages, which are contracted to last for a period of minutes to multiple years and permit sexual intercourse. Sunni women are allowed to enter only one marriage permanently at a time whereas Shi'ia women both temporary or permanent. 
* [[Hinduism]] has varied views about sexuality, but Hindu society, in general, perceives [[extramarital sex]] to be immoral and shameful.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;Don S.

* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ethics, in its most general formulation, holds that one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure since it binds one to the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and prevents one attaining the goal of [[Nirvana]]. Since Buddhist monastics (i.e. [[bhikshu]]s and [[bhikshuni]]s) are to be fully dedicated towards this goal, they undertake the training rule of total abstinence from sexual intercourse, i.e. of celibacy. Other monastic training rules from the Code of Discipline ([[Patimokkha]] or Pratimoksasutra) and canonical [[Vinaya]] scriptures are to prevent masturbation, lustfully touching and speaking to members of the other sex, and other forms of sexual behaviour. Buddhist lay people undertake the [[Five Precepts]], the third of which is avoiding sexual misconduct. Peter Harvey says that this precept "relates primarily to the avoidance of causing suffering by one's sexual behaviour. Adultery—'going with the wife of another'—is the most straightforward breach of this precept. The wrongness of this is seen as partly in terms of its being an expression of greed, and partly in terms of its harm to others. It is said that a man breaks the precept if he has intercourse with women who are engaged, or who are still protected by any relative, or young girls not protected by a relative, Clearly, rape and incest are breaches of the precept."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''. Cambridge, 2000: 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist Canonical scriptures contain no other regulations or recommendations for lay people—for example, with regards homosexuality, masturbation, sexual practices and contraceptives. However, in keeping with the Buddhist ethical principles of not-harming and avoiding shame, guilt and remorse, socially taboo forms of sexuality as well as obsessive sexual activities can also be seen as being included in the third precept. Later Buddhist authors such as [[Nagarjuna]] give various clarifications and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''.

*[[Meher Baba]] maintained that "In the beginning of married life the partners are drawn to each other by lust as well as love; but with conscious and deliberate cooperation they can gradually lessen the element of lust and increase the element of love.

In some cases, the sexual intercourse between two people is seen as counter to religious law or doctrine. In many religious communities, including the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Bhikkhu|Mahayana Buddhists]], religious leaders are expected to refrain from sexual intercourse in order to devote their full attention, energy, and loyalty to their religious duties.&lt;ref&gt;William Skudlarek.

In [[zoology]], ''copulation'' often means the process in which a male introduces sperm into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copulation1"/&gt; [[Spider]]s have separate male and female sexes. Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on to it.

The females can store sperm indefinitely.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Spiders"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E. | author2=Fox, R.S. | author3=Barnes, R.D. | last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th|isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004|pages=571–584 | chapter=Chelicerata: Araneae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals that live in water use [[external fertilization]], whereas [[internal fertilization]] may have developed from a need to maintain [[gamete]]s in a liquid medium in the [[Late Ordovician]] epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) occur via [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]), while [[mammal]]s copulate vaginally, and many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s reproduce sexually with external fertilization.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book| author =Cecie Starr| author2 =Christine Evers| author3 =Lisa Starr|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Biology: A Human Emphasis|publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2010 | pages = 630–631| accessdate = December 9, 2010 |isbn =1133170056| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denecke"&gt;{{cite book| author =Edward J.

For primitive [[insect]]s, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; [[courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation.&lt;ref name="Yadav"&gt;{{cite book| author =M.

Bonobos, chimpanzees and dolphins are species known to engage in heterosexual behaviors even when the female is not in estrus, which is a point in her reproductive cycle suitable for successful impregnation. These species are also known to [[Homosexual behavior in animals|engage in same-sex sexual behaviors]].&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt; In these animals, the use of sexual intercourse has evolved beyond reproduction&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt; to apparently serve additional social functions (such as bonding).&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

{{Violence against women}}
'''Sexual violence by intimate partners''' deals with the incidence by country of [[physical abuse]], forced sex, or [[marital rape]] within the context of domestic violence. 

==Domestic violence and sexual abuse==
Domestic [[sexual violence]], such as forced sex or marital rape, may follow or be part of physical abuse, but is not always the case. In [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]], studies estimate that 40–52% of women experiencing physical violence by an intimate partner have also been sexually coerced by that partner.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell JC, Soeken KL. Forced sex and intimate partner violence: effects on women’s risk and women’s health. Violence Against Women, 1999, 5:1017–1035.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Granados Shiroma M.Salud reproductiva y violencia contra la mujer: un ana lisis desde la perspectiva de género. [Reproductive health and violence against women: an analysis from the gender perspective of Nuevo Leon, Asociación Mexicana de Población, Colegio de México, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sexual violence may occur without physical violence.&lt;ref&gt;Hakimi M et al. Silence for the sake of harmony: domestic violence and women’s health in central Java. Yogyakarta, Gadjah Mada University, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Indian state of [[Uttar Pradesh]], in a representative sample of over 6000 men, 7% reported having sexually and physically abused their wives, 22% reported using sexual violence without physical violence and 17% reported that they had used physical violence alone.&lt;ref&gt;Martin SL et al. Sexual behaviour and reproductive health outcomes: associations with wife abuse in India. Journal of the American Medical Association, 1999, 282:1967–1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidence by country==
Studies indicate that sexual assault by an intimate partner is neither rare nor unique to any particular region of the world. For instance, 23% of women in North [[London]], [[England]], reported having been the victim of either an attempted or completed rape by a partner in their lifetime. Similar figures have been reported for [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]], [[Mexico]] (23.0%), [[León, Nicaragua]], (21.7%), [[Lima]], [[Peru]] (22.5%), and for the [[Midlands Province]] in [[Zimbabwe]] (25.0%). The prevalence of women sexually assaulted by an intimate partner in their lifetime (including attempted assaults) has also been estimated in a few national surveys (for example, [[Canada]] 8.0%, [[England]], [[Wales]] and [[Scotland]] (combined) 14.2%, [[Finland]] 5.9%, [[Switzerland]] 11.6% and the [[United States]] 7.7%).

The table below summarizes some available data on the prevalence of sexual coercion by intimate partners.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10936">Promoting recovery from [[:wikt:conflict|conflict]] is not limited to simply a [[humanitarian]], security or development issue and often involves a combination of all three. '''Stabilization of fragile states''' is an approach and a process regarding the fragility and security of said states. Hence, stabilization is an essential concept in relation to fragile and [[failed states]], where basic institutions and services are lacking and where conflict is an influential factor. [[OECD]] uses the term from fragility to resilient to describe the process of stabilization.&lt;ref&gt;OECD From fragility to resilience: http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/62/9/41212290.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Stabilization processes are a multisectoral effort, requiring a variety different instruments that seek to secure the basic needs of the [[population]] and support the development of [[state-building]] to ensure the process is sustainable and builds stronger and more legitimate states These actions are primarily taken by western [[government]]s and national actors often involving a combination of military, political, development and humanitarian objectives, resources and activities to tackle transnational and domestic threats through short term [[security]] promotion.&lt;ref&gt;Centre on Conflict, Development and Peacebuilding: http://graduateinstitute.ch/webdav/site/ccdp/shared/6305/Workshop%20Report-Stabilisation%20_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical logic for international engagement ==
Stabilization, as it is currently articulated and implemented by the [[United States|US]] and other Western governments, is premised on an assumption that weak [[governance]], instability, violent conflict and associated [[poverty]] and underdevelopment pose a direct threat to their strategic interests and international peace and security more broadly. This is because ‘islands of instability’ are seen as constituting sources of regional insecurity and contagion, particularly in their association with [[international terrorism]], [[transnational crime]] and other real and existential threats.&lt;ref&gt;AFRICA SECURITY BRIEF: http://africacenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/AfricaBrief-6.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  While stabilization is firmly rooted in security agendas focused on reducing or eliminating perceived threats, accumulated experience of international intervention and engagement to end conflicts and foster [[peace]] and development over the past decade has emphasized the need to integrate military, political, development and humanitarian action. In contexts as diverse as [[Afghanistan]], [[Haiti]] and [[Timor-Leste]], stabilization has emerged therefore as a key instrument of a broader liberal, transformative peace-building project. As such, it extends beyond short-term or conservative objectives to eliminate immediate threats or merely to ‘stabilize’ temporarily situations of acute crisis to link action across a range of discrete policy spheres with the aim of reducing violence and establishing the political and social conditions necessary for recovery, reconstruction, development and a lasting peace.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Collinson et al. 2010. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4881&amp;title=states-fragility-stabilisation-its-implications-humanitarian-action States of fragility: stabilisation and its implications for humanitarian action]. London: [[Overseas Development Institute]] by:/pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalia, a failed state with no functioning government and with most of the country being controlled by [[Insurgency|insurgents]], is an example of stabilization efforts. For fear of [[Somalia]] becoming a safe haven for terrorist and thus destabilizing the region and threatening the global society, international actors have engaged through [[counter-insurgency]] as a stabilization strategy to remove the insurgents and make Somalia a resilient state for the benefit of Somalis and the [[international security]].

== Policy dimensions ==

=== Security, development and institutional transformation ===
Security and development share a close but complex connection and successful international humanitarian and development stakeholders in [[fragile state]]s must understand and engage the security issues in areas they operate.&lt;ref name=ODI3&gt;Vicki Metcalfe, Ellen Martin and Sara Pantuliano 2011. [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=5415&amp;title=stability-humanitarian-action-security-development-fragile-states Risk in humanitarian action: towards a common approach?] London: [[Overseas Development Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt; Such an understanding has been reached by  donors such as [[DFID]], the [[United Nations]], the [[European Union]] and [[USAID]] and they have all been involved in security sector reform and efforts to improve justice, from the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] to [[Liberia]], [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Timor-Leste]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Yet these efforts have often been limited in their success as a balance security and development is difficult to achieve.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;  The [[UK]] government supported reforms in [[Sierra Leone]] along the principle of "security first" over the last decade, which is believed to have improved security, increased access to and the quality of justice, decreased corruption and positively reformed public service.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Since the end of the [[Sierra Leone Civil War|civil war in 2002]], there has been no majo violence, [[Sierra Leone election, 2007|peaceful elections]] were held in 2007 and there has been enough stability to help build sustainable institutions.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Yet Sierra Leone suffers severe underdevelopment and ranks third to last on the [[UN Human Development Index]] for 2010. This in turn has created frustration and disappointment amongst the younger generation and poses a significant risk of a return to violence.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

=== The role of informal actors and the changing nature of violence ===
Violence does not end simply with the signing of a [[peace agreement]] and often the rates of criminal and [[domestic violence]] have actually risen afterwards.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Addressing national issues that led to conflict or that might trigger conflict again and efforts to improve the state's own security capacity is only two factors in achieving citizens’ security and [[social cohesion]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; The peace process itself may lead to insecurity as [[demobilisation]] of armed groups leave armed, social excluded and frustrated individuals free to continue violence informally. Insecurity can be increased by informal actors, as well as regional and international drivers of instability, such as [[organised crime]], [[drug smuggling]] and [[Illegal arms trafficking]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Organised crime's capacity to undermine state authority and basic [[law enforcement]] is well known in [[Latin America]].&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; In [[Guatemala]], impunity provided as part of the [[Conflict resolution|peace process]] since 1996, following a [[Guatemalan Civil War|30-year civil war]], has allowed former members of the state security apparatus in charge of repression new opportunities for criminal activity.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; [[Mexico]] suffers critical levels of [[Mexico drug war|drug-related violence]] that has led to over 10,000 gang killings in 2010, up from just under 6,600 in 2009; the gangs often command more resources than the state. Building state-society relations and trust are central to the process of combating such violence.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

=== The political dimension ===
Each state and society emerging from conflict have their own specific interplay of sub-national, national, regional and international drivers of insecurity and effective international engagement in fragile states requires a comprehensive understanding of local politics.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; [[Political economy]] and [[conflict analysis]] are increasingly used as a starting point for development and humanitarian strategies. Inclusive political settlements to conflict require agreements to be reached between both elites and their constituencies.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; This process may be complicated not only by an interest in continuing conflict by particular groups and that the elites may be part of the reason for the conflicts initiative (for instance, by marginalising particular groups in their constituency), but also that key political leaders are necessary to ensure effective dialogue.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt; Stabilisation is not a linear process from conflict to peace and rather represents a lengthy and extensive process that is characterised by power struggles and elite bargaining. Elections and the development of democratic institutions requires a lengthy process for the development of political parties and independent electoral commissions and international community expectations for quick wins or 'ideal' governance reforms must be accordingly tempered.&lt;ref name=ODI3/&gt;

The process of stabilizing fragile states is often tied with [[Wikipedia:Good governance#cite note-:0-7|good governance]] and [[Wikipedia:Public service|public service]] delivery for constituents and international development partners.  Post-conflict states face higher challenges in delivering public service and good governance when compared to non-post-conflict counterparts due to reduced state capacity in reform implementation, the absence of human capital, the presence of donor organizations, and legacy local governing systems. For example, in post-conflict Sierre Leonne, public service delivery bypassed weak civil service institutions through donor-led aid projects in fields such as healthcare delivery.  The resulting formation of parallel mechanisms arrives at the cost of building state capacity and citizen accountability.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Blum, Jurgen, Fotini Christia, and Daniel Rogger. 2016. “Public Service Reform in Post-Conflict Societies.” World Bank: Fragile and Conflict State Impact Evaluation Research Program paper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pre-conflict governance structures with traditional or administrative authority, such as the control held by Afghan warlords, historically weaken the delivery of public service and good governance in local regions with a De Jure-De Facto Gap.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Alternatively, well-meaning international attempts to enable good governance can be manipulated by governing regimes to potentially prompt further disorder toward neighbors and citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grindle|first=Merilee S.|date=2007|title=Good Enough Governance Revisited|url=|journal=Development Policy Review|volume=25 (5)|pages=553–574}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Video self-modeling''' ('''VSM''') is a form of [[observational learning]] in which individuals observe themselves performing a [[behavior]] successfully on [[video]], and then [[Imitation|imitate]] the targeted behavior. VSM allows individuals to view themselves being successful, acting appropriately, or performing new tasks. [[Peter Dowrick]], a key researcher in the development of self-modeling, described two forms of VSM, ''feedforward'' and ''self-review''. ''Self-review'' involves someone with a relatively well developed skill watching examples of best performance.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"&gt;Dowrick, P. W. &amp; Biggs, J. (1983), Using Video: Psychological and social applications (1st ed.), New York: Wiley&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the procedure used by [[Laura Wilkinson]], gold medal platform diver, prior to every meet. In an interview after her gold medal performance, she was asked how she prepares for competition.&lt;ref name="National"&gt;National Broadcasting Corporation (2000, September, 24). Laura Wilkinson gold medal interview - Sydney games. New York: NY.&lt;/ref&gt; She said that she watches a video that consists of her best dives along with encouragement from family and coaches. Self-review is mainly used in sports training as a form of [[visual imaging]].&lt;ref name="Buggey"&gt;Buggey, T. (2009). Seeing is Believing: Self-modeling Applications with Children with Autism and Other Developmental Disabilities. Baltimore; Woodbine House.&lt;/ref&gt; Feedforward, on the other hand, is used with people who do not have a skill or when a new skill is emerging. Thus, feedforward is the method most often used in instructional or clinical settings.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"/&gt; Because Feedforward involves new skills or behaviors performed by the viewer, it usually requires some degree of [[video editing]] to make it appear that the viewer is performing in an advanced manner. The term feedforward can be contrasted with the more traditional term ''[[feedback]]'' as it relates to receiving information about performance. Feedback allows people to see how they are doing. Feedforward allows them to see how they could be performing; a [[future self]]. Feedforward is mainly used in [[education]] and [[therapy]] circles and mainly with children with [[disabilities]]. It has been found to be especially effective with children with [[autism]] who tend to be [[Visual learning|visual learners]] and who seem to attend better to monitors than to live models.&lt;ref name="Bauman"&gt;Bauman, M. L.  (1999). Autism: Clinical features and neurological observations. In [[Helen Tager-Flusberg]] (Ed.) Neurological Disorders (pp. 383-399). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

Research across an array of behaviors and many types of disabilities has been ongoing since 1970 with very positive results. Researchers report that changes occur rapidly, there is good maintenance, and that changes [[Generalization|generalize]] across settings.&lt;ref name="Bellini"&gt;Bellini, S. &amp; Akullian, J., (2007). A [[meta-analysis]] of [[video modeling]] and video self-modeling interventions for children and adolescents with [[autism spectrum disorders]]. Exceptional Children, 73, 261-284.&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption by educators and therapists has lagged behind the research possibly because of the technology requirements for editing videos. The advent of user-friendly editing software such as [[iMovie]] and [[Movie Maker]] has gone a long way in solving that problem. Another reason that the use of VSM seems to be gathering momentum is an article that appeared in 2007 by Scott Bellini and Jennifer Akulian.&lt;ref name="Bellini"/&gt;  These researchers conducted a meta-analyses of all forms of video modeling and concluded that both peer and self-modeling met the Council for Exceptional Children's requirements for research-based methods.
Self-modeling has several attributes that sets it apart as a good tool to use with children with disabilities. It uses only positive imagery which makes it fit well into most [[positive behavior support]] plans. Effects of VSM should be seen almost immediately. If change is not seen after two or three viewings, one can move quickly to an alternate intervention.&lt;ref name="Dowrick"/&gt; Finally, there appears to be no real down-side to the method. No damage is done if it does not work for an individual. As Buggey states in his book, the only tangible outcome when no results are seen is that the person ends up with a flattering video of him or herself.&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt;
In his book, ''Seeing is Believing'', [[Tom Buggey]] lists three major ways video footage can be collected and compiled into a feedforward video:&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt;

# '''Imitation''' – Particularly useful with [[language]] skills. Children are prompted to say words or phrases. Words can be new or rarely used and phrases and sentences can be longer or more complex than presently used. Individual words can even be extracted from videos using [[video editing software]] and joined into sentences.
# '''[[Role playing]]''' – Particularly useful for social skills. Children act out scenes of proper behavior that are usually challenging for them. For example, the triggers of [[tantrums]] can be determined and then each trigger can become a scene in the VSM video – with the person performing appropriate alternative behaviors rather than tantruming.
# '''Let the camera roll to capture rare behaviors''' – typically used with persons who cannot imitate or follow directions. This can be very time-consuming; however, it has been used effectively for eating problems. A child can be filmed during several lunch periods and best examples of appropriate eating (such as putting food to mouth) can be extracted and combined into a feedforward movie.

== Caveats ==
Although VSM has shown overwhelming success with a range of ages and types of disabilities it has had problematic results with children under 4 yrs&lt;ref name="Buggey, T. (In Press)"&gt;Buggey, T. (2016). Facilitating social initiations with young preschoolers with autism using self-modeling: A replication. Focus on Autism and Other Disabilities&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;Clark, E., Beck, D., Sloane, H., Goldsmith, D., Jenson, W., Bowen, J., Kehle, T. (1993). Self-Modeling with preschoolers. School Psychology International, 14, 83-89.&lt;/ref&gt; and with persons with very severe [[cognitive disabilities]] (although it has been successful with children with severe autism).&lt;ref name="Hoomes"&gt;Buggey, T., Hoomes, G., Williams, S. &amp; Sherberger, B. (2010). Facilitating social initiations with preschoolers with autism using self-modeling. Focus on Autism and Other Disabilities.&lt;/ref&gt; Users must use caution to not depict behavior that is far beyond the viewer's ability. Showing skills beyond the reach of individuals can cause frustration and work counter to the purpose of VSM. Both [[Speech/language pathologist|speech/language]] and [[Physical therapy|physical]] or [[occupational therapist]]s need to be consulted when the skills needing to be addressed fall within their areas of expertise. (update: 2017. Studies with children under the age of 4 were restricted to the training of social skills. However, The Dept. of Education in Minnesota (MDOE) funded a training project for its Birth to 3 caregivers in 2013. Participants were trained in the use of VSM and were required to record and report results to a MDOE supervisor. Over 90 personnel were trained and 87 submitted results. All but 3 reported positive results. The skills addressed were mainly functional and language-based. Because none of these cases involved training social interaction skills, it was hypothesized that use of VSM with children under 4 [as young as 2 yrs. 1 mo.] was practical for certain behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Grove, V. &amp; Buggey, T. (2014). The Minnesota Project: VSM use in Early Intervention. The Division of Early Childhood (CEC) Annual Conference. St. Louis, MO.&lt;/ref&gt;)

Users should also be aware of the differences between ''self-modeling'' and ''[[self-observation]]''. While self-modeling involves edited videos depicting only positive imagery, self-observation involves watching raw, unedited footage of behavior. The classic example of self-observation is watching game films in sports. Much can be gained by using self-observation; however, there is a risk that if behaviors viewed are too negative (e.g. a lineman missing blocking assignments 60% of the time) it could adversely affect [[self-confidence]], and thus the performance of the viewer. Buggey&lt;ref name="Buggey"/&gt; suggests that use of self-observation with children with disabilities should be used with extreme caution.

== Theory behind self-modeling ==

Many self-modeling researchers point to [[Albert Bandura]]'s studies&lt;ref name="Bandura"&gt;Bandura, A. (1994). Self-efficacy. In V. S. Ramachaudran (Ed.), Encyclopedia of human behavior (Vol. 4, pp. 71-81). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  on [[Observational learning|social learning]] as key to the understanding of the effectiveness of VSM. Bandura made two fundamental findings that relate directly to self modeling. The first is that the best models are those as close to the viewer as possible in all attributes including ability. You cannot get closer than when the model and viewer are the same person with only a slight change in ability. The other finding involves [[self-efficacy]], the belief that one can succeed at a task. Bandura found that the higher the belief in success, the higher the success rate. Self-modeling allows children to see themselves succeeding, and increases self-efficacy (as long as the new behavior is attainable and developmentally appropriate).

One of the reasons VSM may work so well with social behaviors may have been uncovered by Thomas Kehle and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Theodore"&gt;Kehle, T. J., Bray, M. A., Margiano, S. G., Theodore, L. A., &amp; Zhou, Z. (2002). Self-modeling as an effective intervention for students with serious emotional disturbance: Are we modifying children's memories? Psychology in the Schools, 39, 203-207.&lt;/ref&gt; While working with children with [[emotional disorder]]s who had had VSM intervention, they noticed that clients had difficulty remembering negative behaviors during [[exit interview]]s. They hypothesized that these individual were not only getting new memories based on VSM experiences, but they were also supplanting memories of the old behaviors. Their hypothesis was substantiated in the 2002 study. Their findings are preliminary and there have not been any published [[replication (scientific method)|replication]]s, but if substantiated, it raises both interesting methodological and ethical issues.

== Possible applications ==
Any behavior that can be observed, and thus filmed, can be a subject of a self-modeling video. In their meta-analyes article, Bellini and Akulian identified behaviors that were addressed in studies they evaluated. These include:
# [[Cognitive skill]]s such as math computation
# [[Selective mutism]]
# Language skills
# [[Activities of daily living|Functional skill]]s such as making beds or getting dressed
# [[Motor skill|Physical skill]]s such as swimming or lifting legs when walking
# [[Depression (mood)|Depression]]
# [[Stuttering]]
# [[Oral reading fluency]]

The '''''Walter Lewin Lectures on Physics''''' are a set of three courses including video lectures on [[physics]] by former [[MIT]] Physics Professor [[Walter Lewin]]. He explains the basics of [[classical mechanics]], [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[vibrations]], [[wave]]s and introductory topics on [[astrophysics]].  It was prepared in the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] and has been used by millions of students, teachers and self-learners around the world.

In late 2014, MIT indefinitely removed Lewin's lectures from OpenCourseWare and [[MITx]] due to a sexual harassment case.&lt;ref name="Globe_MIT_removes_lectures"&gt;{{cite news | work=Boston Globe | url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2014/12/09/mit-removes-online-lectures-popular-retired-professor-after-sexual-harassment-charge/cbHVoxUCWd1YRKbpJw8rfL/story.html |title = MIT removes professor’s online lectures after harassment charge | date=December 9, 2014 | author=Juan Esteban Cajigas Jimenez}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lectures are still featured on other independent educational websites under the [[Creative Commons license]].

==Overview==
[[File:Prof Walter Lewin Elastic Collisions.ogv|thumb|Walter Lewin explaining one-dimensional [[elastic collision]]s during a physics lecture.]]
Many of Walter Lewin's lectures have been shown for over six years on UWTV in [[Seattle]], reaching an audience of over four million people.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} For fifteen years he was on [[MIT]] Cable TV helping [[First year|freshmen]] with their weekly homework assignments. His programs, which were aired 24 hours per day, were also frequently watched by upper-class students. His special lectures given at [[MIT]] for science teachers and for middle school students can be viewed on Lewin's YouTube channel. The three sets of video lectures are separated into [[classical mechanics]], [[electromagnetism|electricity and magnetism]] and [[wave|vibrations and waves]]. All of the video lectures were available for free from [[MIT OpenCourseWare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walter Lewin|url=http://web.mit.edu/physics/people/faculty/lewin_walter.html|publisher=MIT Department of Physics|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2014 all the material from his courses including the video lectures were pulled from OpenCourseWare after MIT announced that it determined that Lewin had engaged in sexual harassment of an MITx learner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MIT indefinitely removes online physics lectures and courses by Walter Lewin|url=https://newsoffice.mit.edu/2014/lewin-courses-removed-1208|publisher=MIT News Office|accessdate=10 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the video lectures continue to be available on Lewin's YouTube channel.

== Classical mechanics ==
8.01 is a first-semester [[freshman]] [[physics]] class in [[Newtonian mechanics]], [[fluid mechanics]], and kinetic gas theory at [[MIT]]. In addition to the basic concepts of Newtonian mechanics, [[fluid mechanics]], and kinetic gas theory, a variety of interesting topics are covered in this course: [[binary star]]s, [[neutron star]]s, [[black hole]]s, [[resonance]] [[phenomena]], [[musical instrument]]s, [[Gravitational collapse|stellar collapse]], [[supernovae]], Astronomical observations from very high flying [[balloons]] (lecture 35), and a peek into the intriguing [[quantum]] world.

== Electricity and magnetism ==
8.02 is a second-semester freshman [[physics]] class in [[electromagnetism]] at [[MIT]]. The 36 video lectures on [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]], by Professor Lewin, were recorded on the [[MIT]] campus during the Spring of 2002. Prof. Lewin is well-known at [[MIT]] and beyond for his dynamic and engaging lecture style.

This class includes many topics, specially the classical theory of [[electromagnetism]]. In addition to the basic concepts of [[electromagnetism]], a vast variety of interesting topics are covered in this course: [[lightning]], [[artificial pacemaker|pacemakers]], [[electric shock]] treatment, [[electrocardiogram]]s, [[metal detector]]s, [[musical instrument]]s, [[magnetic levitation]], [[Shinkansen|bullet trains]], [[electric motor]]s, [[radio]]s, [[TV]], [[car]] coils, [[superconductivity]], [[aurora borealis]], [[rainbow]]s, [[radio telescope]]s, [[interferometer]]s, [[particle accelerator]]s (a.k.a. atom smashers or [[collider]]s), [[mass spectrometer]]s, red [[sunset]]s, [[Diffuse sky radiation|blue skies]], haloes around [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], [[color]] perception, [[Doppler effect]], [[Big Bang|Big-Bang]] [[cosmology]].

== Vibrations and waves ==
8.03 deals with lots of topics in [[physics]] dealing with [[vibrations]] and [[wave]]s. Topics include: mechanical [[vibrations]] and [[wave]]s; [[simple harmonic motion]], [[Superposition principle|superposition]], forced vibrations and [[resonance]], [[coupled oscillation]]s and normal modes; vibrations of continuous systems; [[Reflection (physics)|reflection]] and [[refraction]]; phase and [[group velocity]]. [[Optics]]; wave solutions to [[Maxwell's equations]]; [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]]; [[Snell's Law]], [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]], [[Huygens' principle]], [[Fraunhofer diffraction]] and [[Diffraction grating|gratings]].

In addition to the traditional topics of mechanical [[vibrations]] and [[wave]]s, coupled oscillators, and electro-magnetic [[radiation]], students  also learn about [[musical instruments]], red [[sunset]]s, glories, [[coronae]], [[rainbows]], haloes, [[X-ray]] binaries, [[neutron]] stars, [[black holes]] and [[Big-Bang]] [[cosmology]].
