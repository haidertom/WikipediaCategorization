      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5325">'''BioPAX''' (Biological Pathway Exchange) is a [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]]/[[Web Ontology Language|OWL]]-based
standard language to represent [[biological pathway]]s
at the molecular and cellular level. Its major use is to facilitate the exchange of pathway data.
Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but
its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid
interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many
databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this
problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share.
BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and
gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX,
millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a
growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a
computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.

It is supported by a variety of online databases (e.g. [[Reactome]]) and tools. The latest released version is BioPAX Level 3. There is also an effort to create a version of BioPAX as part of [[Open Biomedical Ontologies|OBO]].

==Governance and development==

The next version of BioPAX, Level 4, is being developed by a community of researchers. Development is coordinated by board of editors and facilitated by various BioPAX work groups.

[[SBPAX|Systems Biology Pathway Exchange (SBPAX)]] is an extension for Level 3 and proposal for Level 4 to add quantitative data and [[systems biology]] terms (such as [[Systems Biology Ontology]]). SBPAX export has been implemented by the [[biological pathway|pathway]] databases [[Signaling Gateway (website)#Molecule Pages Database|Signaling Gateway Molecule Pages]]&lt;ref name="pmid21505029"&gt;{{cite journal

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5607">A '''biorefinery''' is a facility that integrates biomass conversion processes and equipment to produce fuels, power, heat, and value-added chemicals from [[biomass]]. The biorefinery concept is analogous to today's [[petroleum refinery]], which produce multiple fuels and products from [[petroleum]].&lt;ref&gt;Dr W J Smith, Tamutech Consultancy. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/mapping-the-development-of-uk-biorefinery-complexes-nnfcc-07-008 Mapping the Development of UK Biorefinery Complexes], NNFCC, 2007-06-20. Retrieved on 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Energy Agency]] Bioenergy Task 42 on Biorefineries has defined biorefining as the sustainable processing of biomass into a spectrum of bio-based products (food, feed, chemicals, materials) and bioenergy (biofuels, power and/or heat).

By producing multiple products, a biorefinery takes advantage of the various components in biomass and their intermediates therefore maximizing the value derived from the biomass feedstock. Some researcher have considered the exploration of a biorefinery as a practical method of improving the economic performance of stand-alone biomass to bioenergy system since biochemicals are produced&lt;ref&gt;1.	Okoro, V.O., Sun, Z. and Birch, J. 2017. Meat processing waste as a potential feedstock for biochemicals and biofuels- A review of possible conversion technologies. Journal of Cleaner Production 142 .1583-1608&lt;/ref&gt; A biorefinery could, for example, produce one or several low-volume, but high-value, chemical or [[nutraceutical]] products and a low-value, but high-volume liquid transportation fuel such as [[biodiesel]] or [[bioethanol]] (see also [[alcohol fuel]]).&lt;ref&gt;[[National Non-Food Crops Centre]]. [http://www.nnfcc.co.uk/tools/the-biorefinery-opportunity-a-north-east-england-view-nnfcc-08-001 The Biorefinery Opportunity - A North East England view, NNFCC 08-001], NNFCC, 2008-06-28. Retrieved on 2011-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time generating electricity and process heat, through [[combined heat and power]] (CHP) technology, for its own use and perhaps enough for sale of electricity to the local utility. The high-value products increase profitability, the high-volume fuel helps meet energy needs, and the power production helps to lower energy costs and reduce [[greenhouse gas]] emissions from traditional power plant facilities.  Although some facilities exist that can be called bio-refineries, the bio-refinery has yet to be fully realized. Future biorefineries may play a major role in producing chemicals and materials that are traditionally produced from [[petroleum]].

==Examples==
The fully operational [[Blue Marble Energy]] company has multiple biorefineries located in Odessa, WA and Missoula, MT.

Canada's first Integrated Biorefinery, developed on anaerobic digestion technology by [[Himark BioGas]] is located in [[Hairy Hill, Alberta]]. The Biorefinery utilizes Source Separated Organics from the metro [[Edmonton]] region, Open Pen Feedlot Manure, and Food Processing Waste.

Several potential biorefinery examples have been proposed, starting from feedstocks such as [[tobacco]], [[flax]] [[straw]] and the residues from the production of [[bioethanol]].&lt;ref&gt;Cedric Briens, Jan Piskorz and Franco Berruti, "Biomass Valorization for Fuel and Chemicals Production -- A Review," 2008. International Journal of Chemical Reactor Engineering, 6, R2&lt;/ref&gt; Biorefineries have also been proposed to gather as much materials from trees (i.e. cellulose, hemicellulose, lignine, lipids) as possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.unu.edu/zef/publications-e/intro%20to%20biorefinery.pdf Janis Gravitis' biorefinery]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chemrec|Chemrec's]] technology for [[black liquor]] [[gasification]] and production of [[second-generation biofuels]] such as [[biomethanol]] or Bio[[Dimethyl ether|DME]] is integrated with a host [[pulp mill]] and utilizes a major [[sulfate process|sulfate]] or [[sulfite process]] waste product as feedstock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestencyclopedia.net/p/p1204 Forest Encyclopedia Network]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blackwater river''' is a type of [[River#Classification|river]] with a slow-moving channel flowing through forested [[swamp]]s or [[wetland]]s. As vegetation decays, [[tannin]]s leach into the water, making a transparent, acidic water that is darkly stained, resembling tea. Most major blackwater rivers are in the [[Amazon Basin]] and the [[Southern United States]]. The term is used in [[fluvial]] studies, [[geology]], [[geography]], [[ecology]], and [[biology]].  Not all dark rivers are blackwater in that technical sense. Some rivers in temperate regions, which drain or flow through areas of dark black [[loam]], are simply black due to the color of the soil; these rivers are ''black mud rivers''. There are also black mud [[Estuary|estuaries]].

Blackwater rivers are lower in nutrients than [[Whitewater river (river type)|whitewater rivers]] and have [[Ionic strength|ionic concentrations]] higher than rainwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2989823 |last=Janzen |first=D H |title=Tropical Blackwater Rivers, Animals, and Mast Fruiting by the [[Dipterocarpaceae]] |journal=Biotropica |volume=6 |issue=2 |date=July 1974 |pages=69–103 |jstor=2989823}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sioli |first=Harald |year=1975 |title=Tropical rivers as expressions of their terrestrial environments |journal=Tropical Ecological Systems/Trends in Terrestrial and Aquatic Research |pages=275–288 |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer-Verlag]] |location=[[New York City]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unique conditions lead to flora and fauna that differ from both whitewater and [[Clearwater river (river type)|clearwater rivers]].&lt;ref name=Duncan&gt;Duncan, W.P.; and Fernandes, M.N.

Black and [[Whitewater river (river type)|white waters]] differ significantly in their ionic composition, as shown in [[#table1|Table 1]].  Black waters are more [[acid]]ic, resulting in an [[aluminum]] concentration greater than that of the more neutral white waters.  The major difference is the concentrations of [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[calcium]] and [[potassium]]; these are very low in black waters.  This has ecological implications. Some animals need more calcium than is available in blackwaters, so for example, [[snail]]s, which need much calcium to build shells, are not abundant in blackwaters. The lack of dissolved ions in black waters results in a low [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]], similar to that of rainwater.

Black and white waters differ in their [[plankton]]ic [[fauna]] and [[flora]]. [[#table2|Tables 2]] and [[#table3|3]] compare the number of planktonic animals caught in black and white water localities only a few meters apart. The black water was not as extreme an example as the [[Rio Negro (Amazon)|Rio Negro]] system. However, it can be seen that the black water held greater numbers of [[rotifer]]s but fewer [[crustacean]]s and [[mite]]s. These crustaceans are important foods for [[larva]]l fish. The zones where the two waters mix are attractive to [[ostracod]]s and young fish. These mixing zones tend to have many animals. The abundance is shown in Table{{nbsp}}3, which compares animals in {{convert|10|l}} of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Comparison between white and black waters |accessdate=2006-05-21 |url=http://www.amazonian-fish.co.uk/indexc30.html |work=Amazonian Fishes and their Habitats |publisher=Pisces Conservation Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison between clear and black waters==
Blackwater rivers resemble [[Clearwater river (river type)|clearwater rivers]] in having a low conductivity and relatively low levels of [[Total dissolved solids|dissolved solids]], but clearwater rivers have water that often only is somewhat acidic (typical [[pH]] ~6.5)&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; and very clear with a greenish color.&lt;ref name=Giovanetti&gt;Giovanetti, T.A.; and Vriends, M.M. (1991). ''Discus Fish'', p. 15. Barron's Educational Serie. {{ISBN|0-8120-4669-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main Amazonian clearwater rivers have their source in the [[Brazilian Plateau]] (such as [[Tapajós River|Tapajós]], [[Tocantins River|Tocantins]], [[Xingu River|Xingu]] and some right tributaries of the [[Madeira River|Madeira]]), but some originate in the [[Guiana Shield]] (such as [[Nhamundá River|Nhamundá]], [[Paru River|Paru]] and [[Araguari River (Amapá)|Araguari]]).&lt;ref&gt;Junk, W.J.; Piedade, M.T.F.; Schöngart, J.; Cohn-Haft, M.; Adeney, J.M.; and Wittmann, F.A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22378">'''Codon usage bias''' refers to differences in the frequency of occurrence of [[Synonymous substitution|synonymous]] [[codon]]s in coding DNA. A codon is a series of three [[nucleotide]]s (a triplet) that [[genetic code|encodes]] a specific [[amino acid]] residue in a [[polypeptide]] chain or for the termination of translation ([[stop codon]]s).

There are 64 different codons (61 codons encoding for amino acids plus 3 stop codons) but only 20 different translated amino acids. The overabundance in the number of codons allows many amino acids to be encoded by more than one codon. Because of such redundancy it is said that the [[genetic code]] is degenerate. The genetic codes of different organisms are often biased towards using one of the several codons that encode the same amino acid over the others—that is, a greater frequency of one will be found than expected by chance. How such biases arise is a much debated area of [[molecular evolution]]. Codon usage tables detailing genomic codon usage bias for most organisms in [[GenBank]] and [[RefSeq]] can be found in the [https://hive.biochemistry.gwu.edu/cuts/about HIVE-Codon Usage Table database].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Athey|first1=John |last2=Alexaki |first2=Aikaterini |last3=Osipova |first3=Ekaterina |last4=Rostovtsev |first4=Alexandre |last5=Santana-Quintero |first5=Luis V.|last6=Katneni |first6=Upendra |last7=Simonyan |first7=Vahan |last8=Kimchi-Sarfaty |first8=Chava |date=2017-09-02 |title=A new and updated resource for codon usage tables |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=18 |issue=391  |doi=10.1186/s12859-017-1793-7 |pmc=5581930 |pmid=28865429 |url=https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-017-1793-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is generally acknowledged that codon biases reflect a balance between mutational biases and natural selection for translational optimization. Optimal codons in fast-growing microorganisms, like ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' or ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' (baker's yeast), reflect the composition of their respective genomic [[tRNA]] pool.&lt;ref name="Dong1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dong|first=Hengjiang|last2=Nilsson|first2=Lars|last3=Kurland|first3=Charles G.|year=1996|title=Co-variation of tRNA abundance and codon usage in ''Escherichia coli'' at different growth rates|url=https://doi.org/10.1006/jmbi.1996.0428|journal=Journal of Molecular Biology|volume=260|issue=5|pages=649–663|doi=10.1006/jmbi.1996.0428|issn=0022-2836}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that optimal codons help to achieve faster translation rates and high accuracy. As a result of these factors, translational selection is expected to be stronger in highly expressed genes, as is indeed the case for the above-mentioned organisms.&lt;ref name="Sharp1993"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Sharp |first=Paul M. |last2=Stenico |first2=Michele |last3=Peden |first3=John F. |last4=Lloyd |first4=Andrew T. |year=1993 |title=Codon usage: mutational bias, translational selection, or both? |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f996/f4e7c3d60b19c2d438a26e23468272413af1.pdf |journal=Biochem.

Examples of this are ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' (human) and ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2018}}. Organisms that show an intermediate level of codon usage optimization include ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' (fruit fly), ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' (nematode [[worm]]), ''[[Strongylocentrotus purpuratus]]'' ([[sea urchin]]) or ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' ([[thale cress]]).&lt;ref name="Duret2000"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duret|first=Laurent|year=2000|title=tRNA gene number and codon usage in the ''C. elegans'' genome are co-adapted for optimal translation of highly expressed genes|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/S0168-9525(00)02041-2|journal=Trends in Genetics|volume=16|issue=7|pages=287–289|doi=10.1016/s0168-9525(00)02041-2|issn=0168-9525}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several viral families ([[herpesvirus]], [[lentivirus]], [[papillomavirus]], [[polyomavirus]], [[adenovirus]], and [[parvovirus]]) are known to encode structural proteins that display heavily skewed codon usage compared to the host cell.

The nature of the codon usage-tRNA optimization has been fiercely debated. It is not clear whether codon usage drives tRNA evolution or vice versa. At least one mathematical model has been developed where both codon usage and [[tRNA]] expression co-evolve in feedback fashion (''i.e.'', codons already present in high frequencies drive up the expression of their corresponding tRNAs, and tRNAs normally expressed at high levels drive up the frequency of their corresponding codons).  However, this model does not seem to yet have experimental confirmation. Another problem is that the evolution of tRNA genes has been a very inactive area of research.

== Contributing factors ==

Different factors have been proposed to be related to codon usage bias, including gene expression level (reflecting selection for optimizing translation process by tRNA abundance), %G+C composition (reflecting horizontal gene transfer or mutational bias), GC skew (reflecting strand-specific mutational bias), amino acid conservation, protein hydropathy, transcriptional selection, RNA stability, optimal growth temperature, hypersaline adaptation and dietary nitrogen.&lt;ref name="pmid11719972"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ermolaeva MD | title = Synonymous codon usage in bacteria | journal = Curr Issues Mol Biol | volume = 3 | issue = 4 | pages = 91–7 |date=October 2001 | pmid = 11719972 | doi = | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid12364606"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lynn DJ, Singer GA, Hickey DA | title = Synonymous codon usage is subject to selection in thermophilic bacteria | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 30 | issue = 19 | pages = 4272–7 |date=October 2002 | pmid = 12364606 | pmc = 140546 | doi = 10.1093/nar/gkf546 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid18397532"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Paul S, Bag SK, Das S, Harvill ET, Dutta C | title = Molecular signature of hypersaline adaptation: insights from genome and proteome composition of halophilic prokaryotes | journal = Genome Biol. | volume = 9 | issue = 4 | pages = R70 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18397532 | pmc = 2643941 | doi = 10.1186/gb-2008-9-4-r70 | url = | issn = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "pmid23637123" &gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1534/g3.113.005769| title = Genome-Wide Patterns of Codon Bias Are Shaped by Natural Selection in the Purple Sea Urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus| journal = G3| volume = 3| issue = 7| pages = 1069–1083| year = 2013| last1 = Kober | first1 = K.

== Evolutionary theories ==

=== Mutational bias versus selection === 
Although the mechanism of codon bias selection remains controversial, possible explanations for this bias fall into two general categories. One explanation revolves around the selectionist theory, in which codon bias contributes to the efficiency and/or accuracy of protein expression and therefore undergoes [[positive selection]]. The selectionist model also explains why more frequent codons are recognized by more abundant tRNA molecules, as well as the correlation between preferred codons, tRNA levels and gene copy numbers. Although it has been shown that the rate of amino acid incorporation at more frequent codons occurs at a much higher rate than that of rare codons, the speed of translation has not been shown to be directly affected and therefore the bias towards more frequent codons may not be directly advantageous. However, the increase in [[translation (biology)|translation elongation]] speed may still be indirectly advantageous by increasing the cellular concentration of free [[ribosomes]] and potentially the rate of initiation for [[messenger RNA]]s.&lt;ref name = "pmid18983258"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second explanation for codon usage can be explained by mutational bias, a theory which posits that codon bias exists because of nonrandomness in the mutational patterns. In other words, some codons can undergo more changes and therefore result in lower equilibrium frequencies, also known as “rare” codons. Different organisms also exhibit different mutational biases, and there is growing evidence that the level of genome-wide [[GC content]] is the most significant parameter in explaining codon bias differences between organisms. Additional studies have demonstrated that codon biases can be statistically predicted in [[prokaryotes]] using only [[intergenic region|intergenic sequences]], arguing against the idea of selective forces on [[coding regions]] and further supporting the mutation bias model. However, this model alone cannot fully explain why preferred codons are recognized by more abundant tRNAs.&lt;ref name = "pmid18983258" /&gt;

=== Mutation-selection-drift balance model ===
To reconcile the evidence from both mutational pressures and selection, the prevailing hypothesis for codon bias can be explained by the mutation-selection-drift balance model. This hypothesis states that selection favors major codons over minor codons, but minor codons are able to persist due to mutation pressure and [[genetic drift]]. It also suggests that selection is generally weak, but that selection intensity scales to higher expression and more functional constraints of coding sequences.&lt;ref name = "pmid18983258" /&gt;

== Consequences of codon composition ==

=== Effect on RNA secondary structure ===
Because [[nucleic acid secondary structure|secondary structure]] of the 5’ end of mRNA influences translational efficiency, synonymous changes at this region on the mRNA can result in profound effects on [[gene expression]]. Codon usage in [[noncoding DNA]] regions can therefore play a major role in RNA secondary structure and downstream protein expression, which can undergo further selective pressures. In particular, strong secondary structure at the [[ribosomal binding site|ribosome-binding site]] or [[start codon|initiation codon]] can inhibit translation, and mRNA folding at the 5’ end generates a large amount of variation in protein levels.&lt;ref name = "pmid22921354"&gt;{{Cite journal

| first2 = L
| doi = 10.1016/j.tig.2012.07.006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on transcription/gene expression ===
[[Heterologous expression|Heterologous gene expression]] is used in many biotechnological applications, including protein production and [[metabolic engineering]]. Because tRNA pools vary between different organisms, the rate of [[transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and translation of a particular coding sequence can be less efficient when placed in a non-native context. For an overexpressed [[transgene]], the corresponding mRNA makes a large percent of total cellular RNA, and the presence of rare codons along the [[primary transcript|transcript]] can lead to inefficient use and depletion of ribosomes and ultimately reduce levels of heterologous protein production. However, using codons that are optimized for tRNA pools in a particular host to overexpress a heterologous gene may also cause amino acid starvation and alter the equilibrium of tRNA pools. This method of adjusting codons to match host tRNA abundances, called codon optimization, has traditionally been used for expression of a heterologous gene. However, new strategies for optimization of heterologous expression consider global nucleotide content such as local mRNA folding, codon pair bias, a codon ramp or codon correlations.&lt;ref name = "pmid21102527"&gt;{{Cite journal

| pages = 32–42
| last2 = Kudla
| first2 = G
| doi = 10.1038/nrg2899
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialized codon bias is further seen in some [[endogenous]] genes such as those involved in amino acid starvation. For example, [[amino acid synthesis|amino acid biosynthetic]] enzymes preferentially use codons that are poorly adapted to normal tRNA abundances, but have codons that are adapted to tRNA pools under starvation conditions. Thus, codon usage can introduce an additional level of transcriptional regulation for appropriate gene expression under specific cellular conditions.&lt;ref name = "pmid21102527" /&gt;

=== Effect on speed of translation elongation ===
Generally speaking for highly expressed genes, translation elongation rates are faster along transcripts with higher codon adaptation to tRNA pools, and slower along transcripts with rare codons. This correlation between codon translation rates and cognate tRNA concentrations provides additional modulation of translation elongation rates, which can provide several advantages to the organism. Specifically, codon usage can allow for global regulation of these rates, and rare codons may contribute to the accuracy of translation at the expense of speed.&lt;ref name = "doi1"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.5936/csbj.201204006| title = Genetic Code Redundancy and Its Influence on the Encoded Polypeptides| journal = Computational and Structural Biotechnology Journal| volume = 1| pages = 1–8| year = 2012| last1 = Spencer | first1 = P. S. | last2 = Barral | first2 = J. M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effect on protein folding ===
[[Protein folding]] ''in vivo'' is vectorial, such that the [[N-terminus]] of a protein exits the translating ribosome and becomes solvent-exposed before its more [[C-terminal]] regions. As a result, co-translational protein folding introduces several spatial and temporal constraints on the nascent polypeptide chain in its folding trajectory. Because mRNA translation rates are coupled to protein folding, and codon adaption is linked to translation elongation, it has been hypothesized that manipulation at the sequence level may be an effective strategy to regulate or improve protein folding. Several studies have shown that pausing of translation as a result of local mRNA structure occurs for certain proteins, which may be necessary for proper folding. Furthermore, synonymous mutations have been shown to have significant consequences in the folding process of the nascent protein and can even change substrate specificity of [[enzymes]]. These studies suggest that codon usage influences the speed at which [[peptide|polypeptides]] emerge vectorially from the ribosome, which may further impact protein folding pathways throughout the available structural space.&lt;ref name = "doi1" /&gt;

A '''cyanide''' is a [[chemical compound]] that contains the group C≡N. This group, known as the '''cyano group''', consists of a [[carbon]] atom [[triple-bond]]ed to a [[nitrogen]] atom.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/C01486.html ''cyanides'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In inorganic cyanides, the cyanide group is present as the anion CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  For the [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] such as [[sodium cyanide]] and [[potassium cyanide]], these compounds are highly toxic.&lt;ref name="CMC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cyanidecode.org/cyanide_environmental.php| title=Environmental and Health Effects of Cyanide| publisher=International Cyanide Management Institute|year=2006| accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrocyanic acid, also known as hydrogen cyanide, or HCN, is a highly volatile liquid that is produced on a large scale industrially.  It is obtained by acidification of cyanide salts.

Organic cyanides are usually called [[nitrile]]s. In nitriles, the CN group is linked by a [[covalent bond]] to carbon.  For example, in [[acetonitrile]], the cyanide group is bonded to [[methyl]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Because they do not release cyanide ions, nitriles are generally far less toxic than cyanide salts.  Some nitriles, which occur naturally as [[cyanohydrin]]s, release hydrogen cyanide.

{{see also|Isocyanide}}
In [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry|IUPAC nomenclature]], [[organic compound]]s that have a&amp;nbsp;–C≡N [[functional group]] are called [[nitrile]]s. Thus, nitriles are organic compounds.&lt;ref&gt;[[IUPAC Gold Book]] [http://goldbook.iupac.org/N04151.html ''nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NCBI-MeSH [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/68009570 ''Nitriles'']&lt;/ref&gt;
An example of a nitrile is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN, [[acetonitrile]], also known as [[methyl]] cyanide. Nitriles usually do not release cyanide ions. A functional group with a hydroxyl and cyanide bonded to the same carbon is called [[cyanohydrin]]. Unlike nitriles, cyanohydridins do release [[hydrogen cyanide]]. In inorganic chemistry, salts containing the C≡N&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ion are referred to as '''cyanides'''.

The word is derived from the Greek ''kyanos'', meaning dark blue, as a result of its being first obtained by the heating of the pigment known as [[Prussian blue]].

===In nature===

Cyanides are produced by certain [[bacterium|bacteria]], [[fungi]], and [[algae]] and are found in a number of plants. Cyanides are found in substantial amounts in certain seeds and fruit stones, e.g., those of [[bitter almond]]s, [[apricot]]s, [[apple]]s, and [[peach]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/toxfaqs/tf.asp?id=71&amp;tid=19 |title=ToxFAQs for Cyanide |accessdate=2008-06-28 |date = July 2006|publisher=[[Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In plants, cyanides are usually bound to [[sugar]] molecules in the form of cyanogenic [[glycoside]]s and defend the plant against [[herbivore]]s. [[Cassava]] roots (also called manioc), an important [[potato]]-like food grown in tropical countries (and the base from which [[tapioca]] is made), also contain cyanogenic glycosides.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|first=J. |last=Vetter |title=Plant cyanogenic glycosides |journal=Toxicon |year=2000 |volume=38 |pages=11–36 |doi=10.1016/S0041-0101(99)00128-2 |pmid=10669009 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Cite journal|first=D.

===Pyrolysis and combustion product===
Hydrogen cyanide is produced by the combustion or [[pyrolysis]] of certain materials under [[oxygen deficient environment|oxygen-deficient condition]]s. For example, it can be detected in the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] of [[internal combustion engine]]s and [[tobacco]] smoke. Certain [[plastic]]s, especially those derived from [[acrylonitrile]], release hydrogen cyanide when heated or burnt.&lt;ref name="CDC"/&gt;

===Coordination chemistry===
{{main|Cyanometalate}}
The cyanide anion is a [[ligand]] for many [[transition metals]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharpe, A. G. The Chemistry of Cyano Complexes of the Transition Metals; Academic Press: London, 1976{{page needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high affinities of metals for this [[anion]] can be attributed to its negative charge, compactness, and ability to engage in π-bonding. Well-known complexes include:
*hexacyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co), which are octahedral in shape.  
*the tetracyanides, [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Ni, Pd, Pt), which are square planar in their geometry;
*the dicyanides [M(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (M = Cu, Ag, Au), which are linear in geometry.

Among the most important cyanide coordination compounds are the octahedrally coordinated compounds [[potassium ferrocyanide]] and the pigment [[Prussian blue]], which are both essentially nontoxic due to the tight binding of the cyanides to a central iron atom.&lt;ref name=Holl&gt;{{ cite book |author1=Holleman, A. F. |author2=Wiberg, E. | title = Inorganic Chemistry | publisher = Academic Press | location = San Diego | year = 2001 | isbn = 0-12-352651-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Prussian blue was first accidentally made around 1706, by heating substances containing iron and carbon and nitrogen, and other cyanides made subsequently (and named after it). Among its many uses, Prussian blue gives the blue color to [[blueprints]], [[bluing (fabric)|bluing]], and [[cyanotype]]s.

The [[enzymes]] called [[hydrogenase]]s contain cyanide [[ligand]]s attached to iron in their active sites. The biosynthesis of cyanide in the [NiFe]-hydrogenases proceeds from [[carbamoyl phosphate]], which converts to [[cystein]]yl [[thiocyanate]], the CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reissmann |first1=Stefanie |last2=Hochleitner |first2=Elisabeth |last3=Wang |first3=Haofan |last4=Paschos |first4=Athanasios |last5=Lottspeich |first5=Friedrich |last6=Glass |first6=Richard S. |last7=Böck |first7=August |title=Taming of a Poison: Biosynthesis of the NiFe-Hydrogenase Cyanide Ligands |journal=Science |volume=299 |issue=5609 |pages=1067–70 |year=2003 |pmid=12586941 |doi=10.1126/science.1080972 |bibcode=2003Sci...299.1067R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organic derivatives===
{{Main|Nitriles}}
Because of the cyanide anion's high [[nucleophile|nucleophilicity]], cyano groups are readily introduced into organic molecules by displacement of a [[halide]] group (e.g., the [[chloride]] on [[methyl chloride]]). In general, organic cyanides are called nitriles. Thus, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CN can be called methyl cyanide but more commonly is referred to as [[acetonitrile]]. In organic synthesis, cyanide is a C-1 [[synthon]]; i.e., it can be used to lengthen a carbon chain by one, while retaining the ability to be [[wiktionary:functionalize|functionalized]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}
:RX + CN&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → RCN + X&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; ([[nucleophilic substitution]]) followed by
# RCN + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[carboxylic acid|RCOOH]] + NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ([[hydrolysis]] under reflux with mineral acid catalyst), or
# 2 RCN + [[Lithium aluminium hydride|LiAlH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] + (second step) 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → [[amine|2 RCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] + LiAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (under [[reflux]] in dry [[diethyl ether|ether]], followed by addition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)

==Manufacture==
{{main|Hydrogen cyanide#Production and synthesis}}
The principal process used to manufacture cyanides is the [[Andrussow process]] in which gaseous [[hydrogen cyanide]] is produced from [[methane]] and [[ammonia]] in the presence of [[oxygen]] and a [[platinum]] [[catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Gaseous hydrogen cyanide may be dissolved in aqueous [[sodium hydroxide]] solution to produce [[sodium cyanide]].{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Cyanide poisoning}}
Many cyanides are highly toxic. The cyanide anion is an [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibitor]] of the [[enzyme]] [[cytochrome c oxidase]] (also known as aa&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in the fourth complex of the [[electron transport chain]] (found in the membrane of the [[mitochondria]] of eukaryotic cells). It attaches to the iron within this protein. The binding of cyanide to this enzyme prevents transport of electrons from [[cytochrome c]] to oxygen. As a result, the electron transport chain is disrupted, meaning that the cell can no longer aerobically produce [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] for energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=David L.|last2=Cox|first2=Michael M.|title=Lehniger Principles of Biochemistry|publisher=[[Worth Publishers]]|year=2000|location=New York|edition=3rd|isbn=1-57259-153-6|pages=668,670–71,676}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tissues that depend highly on [[aerobic respiration]], such as the [[central nervous system]] and the [[heart]], are particularly affected. This is an example of [[histotoxic hypoxia]].&lt;ref name=Biller&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;

The most hazardous compound is [[hydrogen cyanide]], which is a gas and kills by inhalation. For this reason, an air respirator supplied by an external oxygen source must be worn when working with hydrogen cyanide.&lt;ref name="CDC"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://emergency.cdc.gov/agent/cyanide/basics/facts.asp|title=Facts about cyanide:Where cyanide is found and how it is used|last=Anon|date=June 27, 2013|work=CDC Emergency preparedness and response|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen cyanide is produced by adding acid to a solution containing a cyanide salt. Alkaline solutions of cyanide are safer to use because they do not evolve hydrogen cyanide gas. Hydrogen cyanide may be produced in the combustion of [[polyurethane]]s; for this reason, polyurethanes are not recommended for use in domestic and aircraft furniture. Oral ingestion of a small quantity of solid cyanide or a cyanide solution as little as 200&amp;nbsp;mg, or exposure to airborne cyanide of 270 [[parts per million|ppm]], is sufficient to cause death within minutes.&lt;ref name=Biller/&gt;

Organic [[nitrile]]s do not readily release cyanide ions, and so have low toxicities. By contrast, compounds such as [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiCN readily release HCN or the cyanide ion upon contact with water.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Antidote===
[[Hydroxocobalamin]] reacts with cyanide to form [[cyanocobalamin]], which can be safely eliminated by the kidneys. This method has the advantage of avoiding the formation of methemoglobin (see below). This antidote kit is sold under the brand name Cyanokit and was approved by the U.S. FDA in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|814287|Cyanide Toxicity|treatment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An older cyanide antidote kit included administration of three substances: [[amyl nitrite]] pearls (administered by inhalation), [[sodium nitrite]], and [[sodium thiosulfate]]. The goal of the antidote was to generate a large pool of [[ferric]] iron (Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;) to compete for cyanide with cytochrome a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (so that cyanide will bind to the antidote rather than the enzyme). The [[nitrite]]s [[oxidize]] [[hemoglobin]] to [[methemoglobin]], which competes with cytochrome oxidase for the cyanide ion. Cyanmethemoglobin is formed and the [[cytochrome oxidase]] enzyme is restored. The major mechanism to remove the cyanide from the body is by enzymatic conversion to [[thiocyanate]] by the [[mitochondrial]] enzyme [[rhodanese]]. Thiocyanate is a relatively non-toxic molecule and is excreted by the kidneys. To accelerate this detoxification, sodium thiosulfate is administered to provide a sulfur donor for [[rhodanese]], needed in order to produce thiocyanate.&lt;ref&gt;Chaudhary, M.; Gupta, R. "Cyanide Detoxifying Enzyme: Rhodanese" Current Biotechnology, 2012, vol. 1, pp. 327-335. {{DOI|10.2174/2211550111201040327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sensitivity===
Minimum risk levels (MRLs) may not protect for delayed health effects or health effects acquired following repeated sublethal exposure, such as hypersensitivity, [[asthma]], or [[bronchitis]]. MRLs may be revised after sufficient data accumulates.&lt;ref&gt;Toxicological Profile for Cyanide, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 2006{{full citation needed|date=July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Mining===
{{Main|Gold cyanidation}}
Cyanide is mainly produced for the [[mining]] of [[gold]] and [[silver]]: It helps dissolve these metals and their ores. In the ''[[cyanide process]]'', finely ground high-grade ore is mixed with the cyanide (concentration of about two kilogram NaCN per tonne); low-grade ores are stacked into heaps and sprayed with a cyanide solution (concentration of about one kilogram NaCN per ton). The precious metals are complexed by the cyanide [[anion]]s to form soluble derivatives, e.g., [Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; and [Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;{{cite book |first1=Andreas |last1=Rubo |first2=Raf |last2=Kellens |first3=Jay |last3=Reddy |first4=Norbert |last4=Steier |first5=Wolfgang |last5=Hasenpusch |chapter=Alkali metal cyanides |title=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry |year=2006 |doi=10.1002/14356007.i01_i01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::4 Au + 8 NaCN + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 Na[Au(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + 4 NaOH

Silver is less [[Noble metal|"noble"]] than gold and often occurs as the sulfide, in which case redox is not invoked (no O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is required). Instead, a displacement reaction occurs:
::Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4 NaCN + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 Na[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + NaSH + NaOH
The "pregnant liquor" containing these ions is separated from the solids, which are discarded to a [[tailing pond]] or spent heap, the recoverable gold having been removed. The metal is recovered from the "pregnant solution" by reduction with [[zinc]] dust or by [[adsorption]] onto [[activated carbon]]. This process can result in environmental and health problems. A number of [[List of gold mining disasters|environmental disasters]] have followed the overflow of tailing ponds at gold mines. Cyanide contamination of waterways has resulting in numerous cases of human and aquatic species mortality.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Aqueous cyanide is hydrolyzed rapidly, especially in sunlight. It can mobilize some heavy metals such as mercury if present. Gold can also be associated with arsenopyrite (FeAsS), which is similar to [[iron pyrite]] (fool's gold), wherein half of the sulfur atoms are replaced by [[arsenic]]. Gold-containing arsenopyrite ores are similarly reactive toward inorganic cyanide.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Cyanide is also used in [[electroplating]], where it stabilizes metal ions in the electrolyte solution prior to their deposition.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Industrial organic chemistry===
Some nitriles are produced on a large scale, e.g., [[adiponitrile]] is a precursor to [[nylon]]. Such compounds are often generated by combining hydrogen cyanide and alkenes, i.e., [[hydrocyanation]]:
RCH=CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + HCN → RCH(CN)CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Metal catalysts are required for such reactions.

===Medical uses===
The cyanide compound [[sodium nitroprusside]] is used mainly in [[clinical chemistry]] to measure [[urine]] [[ketone bodies]] mainly as a follow-up to [[diabetic]] patients. On occasion, it is used in emergency medical situations to produce a rapid decrease in [[blood pressure]] in humans; it is also used as a [[vasodilator]] in vascular research. The cobalt in artificial [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] contains a cyanide ligand as an artifact of the purification process; this must be removed by the body before the vitamin molecule can be activated for biochemical use. During [[World War I]], a copper cyanide compound was briefly used by [[Japan]]ese physicians for the treatment of [[tuberculosis]] and [[leprosy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takano |first=R. |date=August 1916 |title=THE TREATMENT OF LEPROSY WITH CYANOCUPROL |journal=The Journal of Experimental Medicine |volume=24 |issue= 2|pages=207–211 |url=http://www.jem.org/cgi/content/abstract/24/2/207 |accessdate=2008-06-28 |doi=10.1084/jem.24.2.207 |pmc=2125457 |pmid=19868035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Niche uses===
[[Potassium ferrocyanide]] is used to achieve a blue color on cast [[bronze sculpture]]s during the final finishing stage of the sculpture. On its own, it will produce a very dark shade of blue and is often mixed with other chemicals to achieve the desired tint and hue. It is applied using a torch and paint brush while wearing the standard safety equipment used for any patina application: rubber gloves, safety glasses, and a respirator. The actual amount of cyanide in the mixture varies according to the recipes used by each foundry.

==Chemical tests for cyanide==

===Prussian blue===
[[Iron(II) sulfate]] is added to a solution suspected of containing cyanide, such as the filtrate from the [[sodium fusion test]]. The resulting mixture is acidified with [[mineral acid]]. The formation of [[Prussian blue]] is a positive result for cyanide.

===''para''-Benzoquinone in DMSO===
A solution of [[1,4-Benzoquinone|''para''-benzoquinone]] in [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]] reacts with inorganic cyanide to form a cyano[[phenol]], which is [[fluorescent]]. Illumination with a [[UV light]] gives a green/blue glow if the test is positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1016/0041-008X(80)90225-2 |pmid = 7423496 |title = Fluorometric determination of cyanide in biological fluids with p-benzoquinone*1 |first4 = JL |last4 = Way |first3 = RL |last3 = Morgan |first2 = GE |year = 1980 |last2 = Isom |last1 = Ganjeloo |first1 = A |journal = [[Toxicology and Applied Pharmacology]] |volume = 55 |issue = 1 |pages = 103–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copper and an aromatic amine===
As used by [[fumigation|fumigators]] to detect [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[copper]](II) salt and an aromatic amine such as [[benzidine]] is added to the sample; as an alternative to benzidine an alternative amine di-(4,4-''bis''-dimethylaminophenyl) methane can be used. A positive test gives a blue color. [[Copper(I) cyanide]] is poorly soluble. By sequestering the copper(I) the copper(II) is rendered a stronger [[oxidant]]. The copper, in a cyanide facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound. The [[Nernst equation]] explains this process. Another good example of such chemistry is the way in which the saturated [[calomel]] [[reference electrode]] ([[saturated calomel electrode|SCE]]) works. The copper, in a cyanide-facilitated oxidation, converts the [[amine]] into a colored compound.

===Pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry===
A sample containing inorganic cyanide is purged with air from a boiling acid solution into a basic absorber solution. The cyanide salt absorbed in the basic solution is buffered at pH 4.5 and then reacted with chlorine to form cyanogen chloride. The cyanogen chloride formed couples pyridine with barbituric acid to form a strongly colored red dye that is proportional to the cyanide concentration. This colorimetric method following distillation is the basis for most regulatory methods (for instance EPA 335.4) used to analyze cyanide in water, wastewater, and contaminated soils. Distillation followed by colorimetric methods, however, have been found to be prone to interferences from thiocyanate, nitrate, thiosulfate, sulfite, and sulfide that can result in both positive and negative bias. It has been recommended by the USEPA (MUR March 12, 2007) that samples containing these compounds be analyzed by Gas-Diffusion Flow Injection Analysis—Amperometry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

===Corrinoids colorimetry===

A solution of aquacyano-corrinoids, such as [[cobalamin]] or [[cobinamide]], reacts with free cyanide in an aqueous sample. The binding of cyanide to the corrinoid cobalt center leads to a color change from orange to violet,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Inorganic Chemistry of Vitamin B12|last=Pratt|first=J.M.|publisher=Academic Press|year=1972|isbn=|location=|page=44|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for semi-quantification by naked-eye. Precise quantification of the cyanide content is feasible by [[UV-vis spectroscopy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zelder|first=F.H.|year=2008|title=Specific Colorimetric Detection of Cyanide Triggered by a Conformational Switch in Vitamin B12 |url= |journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=47|pages=1264–1266|via=|doi=10.1021/ic702368b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2009|title=Side chains of cobalt corrinoids control the sensitivity and selectivity in the colorimetric detection of cyanide|url=|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|volume=48|pages=1272–1274|via=|doi=10.1021/ic900053h}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absorption of the corrinoid on a solid phase,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2012|title=Complex samples cyanide detection with immobilized corrinoids |url= |journal=ACS applied materials &amp; interfaces|volume=4|pages=725–729|via=|doi=10.1021/am201357u}}&lt;/ref&gt; allows detection of cyanide even in colored samples, rendering this method appropriate for the analysis of cyanide in water, wastewater, blood, and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tivana, Da Cruz Francisco, Zelder, Bergenståhl, Dejmek |first= |year=2014 |title=Straightforward rapid spectrophotometric quantification of total cyanogenic glycosides in fresh and processed cassava products|url=|journal=Food Chemistry |volume=158 |pages=20–27|via= |doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.02.066}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mannel-Croise, Zelder|first=|year=2012|title=Rapid visual detection of blood cyanide |url= |journal=Analytical Methods |volume=4|pages=2632–2634|via= |doi=10.1039/c2ay25595b}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, this technology is non-toxic and considerably less prone to interference than the pyridine-barbituric acid colorimetry method.

===Gas diffusion flow injection analysis—amperometry===
Instead of distilling, the sample is injected into an acidic stream where the HCN formed is passed under a hydrophobic gas diffusion membrane that selectively allows only HCN to pass through. The HCN that passes through the membrane is absorbed into a basic carrier solution that transports the CN to an amperometric detector that accurately measures cyanide concentration with high sensitivity. Sample pretreatment determined by acid reagents, ligands, or preliminary UV irradiation allow cyanide speciation of free cyanide, available cyanide, and total cyanide respectively. The relative simplicity of these flow injection analysis methods limit the interference experienced by the high heat of distillation and also prove to be cost effective since time consuming distillations are not required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10417">The '''dead-end elimination''' algorithm '''(DEE)''' is a method for [[optimization (mathematics)|minimizing]] a function over a discrete set of independent variables.  The basic idea is to identify "dead ends", i.e., combinations of variables that are not necessary to define a global minimum because there is always a way of replacing such combination by a better or equivalent one. Then we can refrain from searching such combinations further. Hence, dead-end elimination is a mirror image of [[dynamic programming]], in which "good" combinations are identified and explored further. Although the method itself is general, it has been developed and applied mainly to the problems of [[protein structure prediction|predicting]] and [[protein design|designing]] the structures of [[protein]]s. It closely related to the notion of dominance in optimization also known as substitutability in a [[Constraint Satisfaction Problem]]. The original description and proof of the dead-end elimination theorem can be found in {{ref|Desmet}}.

==Basic requirements==
An effective DEE implementation requires four pieces of information:
# A well-defined finite set of discrete independent variables
# A precomputed numerical value (considered the "energy") associated with each element in the set of variables (and possibly with their pairs, triples, etc.)
# A criterion or criteria for determining when an element is a "dead end", that is, when it cannot possibly be a member of the solution set
# An [[objective function]] (considered the "energy function") to be minimized

Note that the criteria can easily be reversed to identify the maximum of a given function as well.

==Applications to protein structure prediction==
Dead-end elimination has been used effectively to predict the structure of side chains on a given [[tertiary structure|protein backbone structure]] by minimizing an energy function &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;.  The [[dihedral angle]] search space of the side chains is restricted to a discrete set of [[rotamer]]s for each [[amino acid]] position in the protein (which is, obviously, of fixed length). The original DEE description included criteria for the elimination of single rotamers and of rotamer pairs, although this can be expanded.

In the following discussion, let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be the length of the protein and let &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; represent the rotamer of the &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{k^{th}}&lt;/math&gt; side chain.  Since atoms in proteins are assumed to interact only by two-body [[potential]]s, the energy may be written

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{TOT} = \sum_{k} E_{k}(r_{k}) + \sum_{k \neq l} E_{kl}(r_{k}, r_{l})\,
&lt;/math&gt;

Where &lt;math&gt;E_{k}(r_{k})&lt;/math&gt; represents the "self-energy" of a particular rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;E_{kl}(r_{k}, r_{l})&lt;/math&gt; represents the "pair energy" of the rotamers &lt;math&gt;r_{k}, r_{j}&lt;/math&gt;.

Also note that &lt;math&gt;E_{kk}(r_{k}^{A}, r_{k}^{A})&lt;/math&gt; (that is, the pair energy between a rotamer and itself) is taken to be zero, and thus does not affect the summations. This notation simplifies the description of the pairs criterion below.

===Singles elimination criterion===

If a particular rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{A}&lt;/math&gt; of sidechain &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; cannot possibly give a better energy than another rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{B}&lt;/math&gt; of the same sidechain, then rotamer A can be eliminated from further consideration, which reduces the search space.  Mathematically, this condition is expressed by the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{k}(r_{k}^{A}) + \sum_{l=1}^{N} \min_{X} E_{kl}(r_{k}^{A}, r_{l}^{X}) &gt; E_{k}(r_{k}^{B}) + \sum_{l=1}^{N} \max_{X} E_{kl}(r_{k}^{B}, r_{l}^{X})
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\min_{X} E_{kl}(r_{k}^{A}, r_{l}^{X})&lt;/math&gt; is the minimum (best) energy possible between rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{A}&lt;/math&gt; of sidechain &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and ''any'' rotamer X of side chain &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.  Similarly, &lt;math&gt;\max_{X} E_{kl}(r_{k}^{B}, r_{l}^{X})&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum (worst) energy possible between rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{B}&lt;/math&gt; of sidechain &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and ''any'' rotamer X of side chain &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;.

===Pairs elimination criterion===

The pairs criterion is more difficult to describe and to implement, but it adds significant eliminating power. For brevity, we define the shorthand variable &lt;math&gt;U_{kl}^{AB}&lt;/math&gt; that is the ''intrinsic'' energy of a pair of rotamers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; at positions &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, respectively

:&lt;math&gt;
U_{kl}^{AB} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\  E_{k}(r_{k}^{A}) + E_{l}(r_{l}^{B}) + E_{kl}(r_{k}^{A}, r_{l}^{B})
&lt;/math&gt;

A given pair of rotamers &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; at positions &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, cannot ''both'' be in the final solution (although one or the other may be) if there is another pair &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; that always gives a better energy. Expressed mathematically,

:&lt;math&gt;
U_{kl}^{AB} + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \min_{X} \left(E_{ki}(r_{k}^{A}, r_{i}^{X}) + E_{lj}(r_{l}^{B}, r_{j}^{X})\right) &gt; U_{kl}^{CD} + \sum_{i=1}^{N} \max_{X} \left(E_{ki}(r_{k}^{C}, r_{i}^{X}) + E_{lj}(r_{l}^{D}, r_{j}^{X})\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A \neq C&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;B \neq D&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k \neq l&lt;/math&gt;.

===Energy matrices===
For large &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;, the matrices of precomputed energies can become costly to store. Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be the number of amino acid positions, as above, and let &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be the number of rotamers at each position (this is usually, but not necessarily, constant over all positions). Each self-energy matrix for a given position requires &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; entries, so the total number of self-energies to store is &lt;math&gt;Np&lt;/math&gt;. ''Each'' pair energy matrix between two positions &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_{l}&lt;/math&gt;, for &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; discrete rotamers at each position, requires a &lt;math&gt;p \times p&lt;/math&gt; matrix. This makes the total number of entries in an unreduced pair matrix &lt;math&gt;N^{2}p^{2}&lt;/math&gt;. This can be trimmed somewhat, at the cost of additional complexity in implementation, because pair energies are symmetrical and the pair energy between a rotamer and itself is zero.

==Implementation and efficiency==
The above two criteria are normally applied iteratively until convergence, defined as the point at which no more rotamers or pairs can be eliminated. Since this is normally a reduction in the sample space by many orders of magnitude, simple enumeration will suffice to determine the minimum within this pared-down set.

Given this model, it is clear that the DEE algorithm is guaranteed to find the optimal solution; that is, it is a [[global optimization]] process. The single-rotamer search scales [[quadratic growth|quadratically]] in time with ''total'' number of rotamers. The pair search scales cubically and is the slowest part of the algorithm (aside from energy calculations). This is a dramatic improvement over the brute-force enumeration which scales as &lt;math&gt;O(p^{N})&lt;/math&gt;.

A large-scale [[benchmark (computing)|benchmark]] of DEE compared with alternative methods of [[protein structure prediction]] and design finds that DEE reliably converges to the optimal solution for protein lengths for which it runs in a reasonable amount of time{{ref|Voigt}}. It significantly outperforms the alternatives under consideration, which involved techniques derived from [[mean field theory]], [[genetic algorithm]]s, and the [[Monte Carlo method]]. However, the other algorithms are appreciably faster than DEE and thus can be applied to larger and more complex problems; their relative accuracy can be extrapolated from a comparison to the DEE solution within the scope of problems accessible to DEE.

==Protein design==
{{main|Protein design}}
The preceding discussion implicitly assumed that the rotamers &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; are all different orientations of the same amino acid side chain. That is, the sequence of the protein was assumed to be fixed. It is also possible to allow multiple side chains to "compete" over a position &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; by including both types of side chains in the set of rotamers for that position. This allows a novel sequence to be designed onto a given protein backbone. A short [[zinc finger]] protein fold has been redesigned this way{{ref|Dahiyat}}. However, this greatly increases the number of rotamers per position and still requires a fixed protein length.

==Generalizations==
More powerful and more general criteria have been introduced that improve both the efficiency and the eliminating power of the method for both prediction and design applications. One example is a refinement of the singles elimination criterion known as the Goldstein criterion{{ref|Goldstein}}, which arises from fairly straightforward algebraic manipulation before applying the minimization:

:&lt;math&gt;
E_{k}(r_{k}^{A}) - E_{k}(r_{k}^{B}) + \sum_{l=1}^{N} \min_{X} \left(E_{kl}(r_{k}^{A}, r_{l}^{X}) - E_{kl}(r_{k}^{B}, r_{l}^{X})\right) &gt; 0
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus rotamer &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{A}&lt;/math&gt; can be eliminated if any alternative rotamer from the set at &lt;math&gt;r_{k}&lt;/math&gt; contributes less to the total energy than &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{A}&lt;/math&gt;. This is an improvement over the original criterion, which requires comparison of the best possible (that is, the smallest) energy contribution from &lt;math&gt;r_{k}^{A}&lt;/math&gt; with the ''worst'' possible contribution from an alternative rotamer.

An extended discussion of elaborate DEE criteria and a benchmark of their relative performance can be found in {{ref|Peirce}}.

'''Deep Green Resistance''' ('''DGR''') is a radical environmental movement that views mainstream [[Environmentalism|environmental activism]] as being largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=McBay&gt;McBay, Aric, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen. 2011. ''Deep Green Resistance.'' New York: Seven Stories Press.&lt;/ref&gt; DGR is also used by group members to refer to their particular political strategies. The group believes that [[industrial civilization]], as they define it, is endangering all life on the planet and that a broad range of tactics are needed to achieve [[environmental justice|environmental]] and [[social justice]]. They argue for a radical shift in societal structures and functions.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Beliefs==
In the book ''Deep Green Resistance'', the authors state that civilization, particularly [[industrialisation|industrial civilization]], is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively (and urgently) dismantled in order to secure a livable future for all species on the planet.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt; Civilization can be defined as the development of agriculture and the growth of cities. Deep Green Resistance argues that agriculture is detrimental to land fertility and cities necessarily surpass the natural carrying capacity of land bases. Civilization relies heavily on industry, which operates largely on non-renewable and unclean fossil fuels.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

DGR's principles stem from the concept of [[deep ecology]] and state that all species are inherently equal, and thus humans are not superior to any other form of life. Deep ecology attributes the current environmental crisis to the anthropocentrism that is embedded in Western perspectives. The term, first used by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]], was quickly taken up by a variety of radical environmental groups, such as Earth First!.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Merle. 1994. “Sustainable Development and Deep Ecology: An Analysis of Competing Traditions.” Environmental Management 18(4):477-488.&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ecology provides a foundation upon which to base the cross-cultural nature-based spirituality that is often associated with radical environmental movements.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. 2001. “Earth and Nature-Based Spirituality (Part I): From Deep Ecology to Radical Environmentalism.” Religion 31:175-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement differentiates itself from [[bright green environmentalism]], which is characterized by a focus on personal, technological, or government and corporate solutions, in that it holds these solutions as inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large-scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per capita industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than personal waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that, lifestyle changes will follow.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Origins and advocates==
The term was created for a conference entitled "Deep Green Resistance. Confronting Industrial Culture" in April, 2007 in Deerfield, Massachusetts. [[Lierre Keith]] was the main organizer.

Deep Green theory draws on elements of [[anthropology]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[deep ecology]] and [[ecofeminism]].

[[Derrick Jensen]] is a prominent member of the Deep Green Resistance Advisory Board. In addition to being a radical activist, he is also a writer, philosopher and teacher. Lierre Keith, another board member, is a feminist activist, writer and small farmer. Stephanie McMillan, and [[Jack D. Forbes]] are also prominent influences on the movement. DGR draws on the philosophy and writings of many authors, including [[Arne Næss]], [[Richard Manning]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], Peggy Reeves Sanday, [[David Abram]], [[Chellis Glendinning]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Joseph Tainter]], [[Richard Heinberg]], [[Daniel Quinn]], Tracie Marie Park (a.k.a. Zoe Blunt) and [[Jerry Mander]], among others.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Resistance tactics==
The Deep Green perspective argues that the dominant culture, a term that encompasses all the cultures within globalized civilization, will not undergo a voluntary transformation to a sustainable way of living. This includes the dismissal of a possible success of a slow and soft shift to [[sustainability]]. Members of the Deep Green movement believe that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse. This notion is based on historical examples of the collapse of major civilizations such as Rome or the Mayan civilization, and statistics regarding the current system's unsustainability. DGR maintains that humans must act decisively before the collapse to ensure the Earth that remains inhabitable for all organisms and that humans build a more sustainably structured society following the collapse.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt; Deep Green Resistance supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Within the Deep Green theory, lifestyle or personal changes are not considered effective methods of creating meaningful change. The mainstream environmental movement is seen as being distracted by its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions instead of confronting systems of power and holding individuals, industries, and institutions accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/4801/ |title=Forget Shorter Showers |publisher=Orion Magazine |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fertileground1.ning.com/page/a-context-for-fg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009210832/http://fertileground1.ning.com/page/a-context-for-fg |archivedate=October 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of the Deep Green movement view technological solutions, no matter how well-intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warn that they could even lead to accelerated ecological destruction and pollution.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

===Advocating for militant resistance===
Decisive Ecological Warfare:&lt;ref name=DGRDEW&gt;{{cite web|title=Decisive Ecological Warfare|url=http://deepgreenresistance.org/en/deep-green-resistance-strategy/decisive-ecological-warfare|website=deepgreenresistance.org|publisher=Deep Green Resistance|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well-organized underground militants would make coordinated attacks on energy infrastructure around the world … actions against pipelines, power lines, tankers, and refineries, perhaps using electromagnetic pulses. ….&lt;ref name=C&amp;C&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ian Angus|title='Deep Green Resistance' – How not to build a movement|url=http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/05/10/deep-green-resistance-a-path-to-certain-defeat/|website=climateandcapitalism.com|publisher=Climate &amp; Capitalism|accessdate=February 9, 2015|format=Book review|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Proponents of Deep Green Resistance encourage strategies for [[social action]] that range from violent to non-violent. DGR's support for militant action (described as a potentially necessary means by which to invoke drastic environmental change) is rejected by many [[pacifist]]s. Some have called this a potential deterrent to environmentalists who believe in nonviolent activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/12/20/deep-green-resistance/ |title=Deep Green Resistance |website=Counterpunch.org |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strategy described by Jensen, McBay and Keith largely centers around hard-hitting infrastructural sabotage, such as forcible [[dam removal]], rather than any kind of personal violence.

Jensen predicts, regarding the movement, that acts of personal violence in the future will be almost completely offensive by those countering the resistance movement (i.e. those currently in power) and self-defensive by those enacting the resistance movement. When asked, "If we dismantle civilization, won't that kill millions of people in cities? What about them?," Jensen has responded that "No matter what you do, your hands will be blood red... because the global economy is [already] murdering humans and non-humans the planet over...." and "As this culture continues to collapse, those who are doing the exploiting will continue.... Don’t blame those who want to stop that exploitation. Instead, help to stop the exploitation that is killing people in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions Killed?|work=Deep Green Resistance|url=http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/faq/millionskilled/|accessdate=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen has also clarified such ideas on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'': "I get accused of being the 'violence guy'... but I don’t ever think that's really fair, because I really consider myself the 'everything guy', that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance.... We can certainly parse out cases where we think it's appropriate to have militant response or non-militant response."&lt;ref name = DN112610&gt;{{cite interview|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]]|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=26 November 2010|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/26/author_and_activist_derrick_jensen|title=Author and Activist Derrick Jensen: "The Dominant Culture is Killing the Planet...It’s Very Important for Us to Start to Build a Culture of Resistance"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith has discussed in depth the "complexity of the issue of violence" in the organization's [[eponymous]] book, and how it is "understandable that people who care about justice want to reject violence; many of us are survivors of it." However, she urges the following distinctions, favoring only the second in each dichotomy: "the violence of hierarchy vs. the violence of self-defense, violence against actual people vs. violence against property, and the [use of] violence as self-actualization vs. the violence of political resistance. It is difficult to find someone who is against all of these."&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

While Deep Green Resistance maintains that it is a strictly aboveground movement, Keith and McBay have openly encouraged an additional element of underground action, and DGR provides the theoretical and aboveground framework to support such action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepgreenresistance.org|title=Deep Green Resistance Homepage|website=Deepgreenresistance.org|accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's book points to historical examples of resistance movements that relied on an interdependence between aboveground and underground networks in order to accomplish mutual goals.

==Literature and references==
A book titled ''Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet'' by Aric McBay, [[Lierre Keith]], and [[Derrick Jensen]] was released in May 2011, from Seven Stories Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet |author1=Derrick Jensen |author2=Aric McBay |author3=Lierre Keith |isbn=9781583229293 |website=Amazon.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into four sections: Resistance, Organization, Strategy and Tactics, and the Future. Each section contains several essays written by McBay or Keith and concludes with Jensen's answers to common questions about resistance. The book intends to provide a framework from which readers can build upon in order to begin fighting for environmental change.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Gender issues==
The organization's official website states that "DGR strives to be a radical organization in every respect, including our approach to feminist struggles."&lt;ref name=radfem&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/faq-radical-feminism/ |title=FAQ: Radical Feminism |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGR's [[radical feminism]] views [[gender role|gender]], by definition, as a social system created by [[patriarchy]] to coercively and violently control behavior of both males and females; however, within this system, men and masculinity are privileged, while women are trained into subordinated behavior and routinely targeted for institutionalized and socially sanctioned violence due to their sex and/or gender role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

DGR's stance on gender has led some to interpret DGR as transphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earthfirstnews.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/deep-green-transphobia/ |title=Deep Green Transphobia |work=earthfirstnews.wordpress.com |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy especially swelled when a newly [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] member of DGR, self-identifying as a woman, requested to join a women-only communal sleeping and showering space and, later, a women-only caucus space; the women's caucus discussed the issue collectively and ultimately denied the applicant.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} A year after this, Aric McBay claimed he "left the organization at the beginning of 2012 after a trans inclusive policy was cancelled by Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith. Many good people and good activists left the organization for that reason. I find these transphobic attitudes to be disgusting and deeply troubling...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aricmcbay.org/2013/05/14/dgr-and-transphobia/ |title=DGR and Transphobia |first=Aric |last=McBay |work=aricmcbay.org |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/2013/05/16/deep-green-reclamation/ |title=Deep Green Resignation and Reclamation &amp;#124; Earth First!

Keith and Jensen reiterated that the women of DGR made the decision to deny the applicant for themselves. In this statement, DGR also affirmed that "the right of women to define their own spaces" is central to how the organization operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/reponse-to-aric-mcbay/ |title=Reponse(sic) to Aric McBay |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |quote=the right of women to define their own spaces |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has denied these claims,&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/protect-women-feminism-and-free-speech/ |title=Protect Women, Feminism, and Free Speech |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that "DGR does not condone dehumanization or violence against anyone, including people who describe themselves as trans."&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org" /&gt; The website asserts that DGR holds "a difference of opinion about the definition of gender" with [[genderism|genderists]], and states that "genderists think gender is an identity, an internal set of feelings people might have. Radical feminists think gender is a caste system."&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"/&gt; DGR's view of gender as a caste system implies that gender is an institution that cannot be improved or remedied, but, rather, requires complete dismantling so that egalitarian, spontaneous, and free behavior can emerge.&lt;ref name="radfem"/&gt; Because DGR inherently defines gender as "a brutal and corrupt arrangement of power," they want to dismantle the gender system, rather than reform it, celebrate it, or make it more inclusive. DGR, as self-described radical feminists, are "critical of gender itself. We are not gender reformists—we are gender abolitionists."&lt;ref name=radfem/&gt;

==Criticism==
{{See also|Deep ecology#Misconceptions|Anarcho-primitivism#Criticism}}
Critics of Deep Green Resistance have made claims similar to critics of [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[deep ecology]]. DGR's ideas have been variously criticized by online publications as polarizing solutions to environmental reform, "elitist", "too radical", or "out of step."&lt;ref name="climateandcapitalism.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted on May 10, 2012 |url=http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/05/10/deep-green-resistance-a-path-to-certain-defeat/ |title='Deep Green Resistance' - A path to certain defeat |website=Climateandcapitalism.com |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Derrick Jensen, for example, has concluded in his earlier work ''Endgame'' that "The mass of civilized people will never be on our side.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGL8PCVc_pcC&amp;pg=PT173&amp;lpg=PT173&amp;dq=%22The+mass+of+civilized+people+will+never+be+on+our+side%22+jensen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=crnwS2f7R7&amp;sig=Pg8F6ze5TXizSQ23qnKw3wpSaFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxCNUdzXOIi5rgH89YDgAw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ |title=The Derrick Jensen Reader: Writings on Environmental Revolution |author=Derrick Jensen |website=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the criticism of organizing a strategy that is pessimistic about popular involvement, and therefore aims at forcing change without the majority's consensus. Some critics have, therefore, argued that "radical tactics tend to be counterproductive to the goal of increasing awareness and concern in the general public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Bron |url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/resistance_do_the_ends_justify_the_means |title=Resistance: Do the Ends Justify the Means? &amp;#124; Latest News &amp;#124; Earth Island Journal &amp;#124; Earth Island Institute |website=Earthisland.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of Deep Green Resistance further claim that DGR, which predicts massive numbers of human deaths during the forthcoming "crash" of civilization, does not offer a feasible or desirable alternative human lifestyle in seeking to accelerate this crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therightplanet.com/2012/01/deep-green-resistance-occupy-until-it-all-falls-apart/ |title=Deep Green Resistance: Occupy Until It All Falls Apart |website=Therightplanet.com |date=2012-01-02 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith and Jensen have both acknowledged this unpleasant reality; however, they have repeatedly claimed that the crash is inevitable (and will only result in more suffering the longer it is delayed) and that they are merely warning of—and trying to prepare the world for—these forthcoming deaths and possible wide-scale violence. Jensen has stated that if activists do not wish to participate in the physical work of accelerating this crash, they, at the very least, should locally prepare and "set up committees to eliminate or, if appropriate, channel the (additional) violence that might break out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Time to Get Out|author=Jensen, Derrick|work=Endgame|url=http://www.endgamethebook.org/Excerpts/18-Time-Get-Out.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists who believe that all hierarchically structured relations, whatever the purpose, are oppressive, disagree with DGR's promotion of the use of hierarchical organization within any underground.&lt;ref name="EF Critique"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AnarchyRadio03-08-2011/ |title=Anarchy Radio 03-08-2011 : John Zerzan : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBay and Keith have both promoted the idea of underground networks organized along hierarchical lines. Keith has advocated for a disciplined "command structure" regarding frontline activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Deep Green Resistance - Strategy to Save the Planet|publisher=YouTube|date=12 August 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZxBg1CbmG8}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBay, in ''Deep Green Resistance'', has argued that hierarchies are an efficient means of organizing underground resistance.&lt;ref name="sproutdistro1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sproutdistro.com/2013/05/18/deep-green-resistance-a-book-review/ |title=Deep Green Resistance: A Book Review |publisher=Sprout Distro |date=2013-05-18 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist writers—among them anarcho-primitivists like [[John Zerzan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Kevin Tucker (anarchist)|Kevin Tucker]]—have criticized DGR's Code of Conduct, their historical understanding of revolution and radical history, and the perceived "cult of personality" around Jensen and Keith.&lt;ref name="EF Critique"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/articles/deep-green-resistance-a-critique|title=Deep Green Resistance — a critique|first1=Michelle| last1=Matisons|first2=Alexander Reid|last2=Ross|publisher=[[Earth First!]] Journal|year=2014–2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthspiritandanarchy.blogspot.com/2011/09/down-graded-resistance-critique-of-dgr.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218172433/http://earthspiritandanarchy.blogspot.com/2011/09/down-graded-resistance-critique-of-dgr.html |archivedate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchistnews.org/node/14669/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103175958/http://anarchistnews.org/node/14669 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enkidu.anarchyplanet.org/2011/06/10/authority-and-civilization/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710101150/http://enkidu.anarchyplanet.org/2011/06/10/authority-and-civilization/ |archivedate=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sproutdistro1"/&gt;

[[Image:Naive realism.jpg|400px|thumb|right|Direct realism argues we perceive the world directly]]

The question of '''direct''' or '''naïve realism''', as opposed to '''indirect''' or '''representational realism''', arises in the [[philosophy of perception]] and [[philosophy of mind|of mind]] out of the debate over the nature of [[Consciousness|conscious]] [[Qualia|experience]];&lt;ref name=lehar&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://cns-alumni.bu.edu/~slehar/webstuff/consc1/consc1.html The Function of Conscious Experience: An Analogical Paradigm of Perception and Behavior], ''Consciousness and Cognition''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ce&gt;Lehar, Steve. (2000). [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html Naïve Realism in Contemporary Philosophy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120811172229/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/epist/naive-philos.html |date=2012-08-11 }}, ''The Function of Conscious Experience''.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] question of whether the world we see around us is the real world itself or merely an internal perceptual copy of that world generated by [[neural]] processes in our [[Human brain|brain]]. [[Naïve realism]] is known as ''direct'' realism when developed to counter ''indirect'' or representative realism, also known as epistemological dualism,&lt;ref&gt;Lehar, Steve. [http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html Representationalism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905185905/http://sharp.bu.edu/~slehar/Representationalism.html |date=2012-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Philosophy|philosophical]] position that our conscious experience is not of the real world itself but of an [[Mental representation|internal representation]], a miniature [[Virtual reality|virtual-reality]] replica of the world.

Indirect realism is broadly equivalent to the accepted view of [[perception]] in natural science that states that we do not and cannot perceive the external world as it really is but know only our ideas and interpretations of the way the world is.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hearing (sense)|Hearing]] (or audition) is the ability to perceive (create ideas of)sound by detecting vibrations. The sound waves of language cannot perceive directly. They are only heard, interpreted and understood because the physical waves were transformed into ideas (Mental representation of sound wages) by our brains.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Representationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is one of the key assumptions of [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] in [[psychology]]. The representational realist would deny that "first-hand knowledge" is a coherent concept, since knowledge is always via some means. Our ideas of the world are interpretations of sensory input derived from an external world that is real (unlike the standpoint of [[idealism]], which holds that only ideas are real, but mind-independent things are not).

The main alternative to representationalism is '''anti-representationalism''',&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; the view according to which perception is not a process of constructing internal representations.

==History==
[[Aristotle]] was the first to provide a description of direct realism. In ''[[On the Soul]]'' he describes how a see-er is informed of the [[substance theory|object itself]] by way of the [[hylomorphism|hylomorphic form]] carried over the intervening material continuum with which the eye is impressed.&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"&gt;{{cite book |first=S. |last=Bernecker |year=2008 |title=The Metaphysics of Memory |series=Philosophical Studies Series |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781402082191 |lccn=2008921236 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hNk4jvxjVhUC&amp;pg=PA62 |page=62 |quote=The distinction between direct and indirect realism about perception has an interesting history. There was a time when perception was understood to be of things themselves, not of our ideas of things. This is what we find in Aristotle and Aquinas, who maintain that the mind or understanding grasps the form of the material object without the matter. What we perceive directly, on this view, are material objects. This changed in the seventeenth century with Descartes and Locke. who can be read as saying that the primary objects of perception are not things external to the mind but sense-data. Sense-data are the messengers that stand between us and physical objects such as tables and chairs. While indirect realism was the standard view of early modern philosophers, nowadays direct realism is, once again, in fashion.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[medieval philosophy]], [[direct realism]] was defended by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref name="Bernecker2008"/&gt;

Indirect realism was popular with several [[early modern philosophy|early modern philosophers]], including [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref name=Yolton&gt;John W. Yolton, ''Realism and Appearances: An Essay in Ontology'', Cambridge University Press, 2000, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Locke]],&lt;ref name=Yolton/&gt; [[G. W. Leibniz]],&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Dickerson, ''Kant on Representation and Objectivity'', Cambridge University Press, 2003, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Berkeley]],&lt;ref name=SEP-PP&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ The Problem of Perception (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]: "Paraphrasing David Hume (1739...; see also Locke 1690, Berkeley 1710, Russell 1912): nothing is ever directly present to the mind in perception except perceptual appearances."&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt;

Locke categorized qualities as follows:&lt;ref&gt;A. D. Smith, "On Primary and Secondary Qualities", ''Philosophical Review'' (1990), 221–54.&lt;/ref&gt; 

* Primary qualities are qualities which are "explanatorily basic" – which is to say, they can be referred to as the explanation for other qualities or phenomena without requiring explanation themselves – and they are distinct in that our sensory experience of them resembles them in reality.  (For example, one perceives an object as spherical precisely because of the way the atoms of the sphere are arranged.)  Primary qualities cannot be removed by either thought or physical action, and include mass, movement, and, controversially, solidity (although later proponents of the distinction between primary and secondary qualities usually discount solidity).
* Secondary qualities are qualities which one's experience does not directly resemble; for example, when one sees an object as red, the sensation of seeing redness is not produced by some quality of redness in the object, but by the arrangement of atoms on the surface of the object which reflects and absorbs light in a particular way.  Secondary qualities include colour, smell, and taste.

[[Thomas Reid]], a notable member of the [[Scottish common sense realism]] was proponent of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Rysiew, ''New Essays on Thomas Reid'', Routledge, 2017, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Direct realist views have been attributed to [[Baruch Spinoza]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Della Rocca (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Spinoza'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]]'s [[empirical realism]] has also been interpreted as a form of direct realism.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Schulting, Jacco Verburgt (eds.), ''Kant's Idealism: New Interpretations of a Controversial Doctrine'', Springer 2010, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Late modern philosophy|Late modern philosophers]], [[J. G. Fichte]] and [[G. W. F. Hegel]] followed Kant in adopting empirical realism.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Breazeale and [[Tom Rockmore]] (eds.), ''Fichte, German Idealism, and Early Romanticism'', Rodopi, 2010, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Rockmore]], ''Before and After Hegel: A Historical Introduction to Hegel's Thought'', Hackett Publishing, 2003, p. xviii: "Hegel follows Kant ... in limiting claims to know to the empirically real. In short, he adopts a view very similar to Kant's empirical realism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gottlob Frege]] (in his paper "[[On Sense and Reference|Über Sinn und Bedeutung]]") also subscribed to indirect realism.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Lebens, ''Bertrand Russell and the Nature of Propositions: A History and Defence of the Multiple Relation Theory of Judgement'', Routledge, 2017, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[contemporary philosophy]], indirect realism has been defended by [[Edmund Husserl]]&lt;ref&gt;Robin D. Rollinger, ''Husserl's Position in the School of Brentano'', ''Phaenomenologica'' 150, Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1999, p. 224 n. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bertrand Russell]]&lt;ref name=SEP-PP/&gt; Direct realism has been defended by [[Hilary Putnam]],&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, Hilary. Sep. 1994. "The Dewey Lectures 1994: Sense, Nonsense, and the Senses: An Inquiry into the Powers of the Human Mind." ''The Journal of Philosophy'' '''91'''(9):445–518.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McDowell]],&lt;ref&gt;John McDowell, ''Mind and World''. Harvard University Press, &lt;!--November--&gt;1994, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger F. Gibson, "McDowell's Direct Realism and Platonic Naturalism", ''Philosophical Issues'' Vol. 7, ''Perception'' (1996), pp. 275–281.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Galen Strawson, [https://vimeo.com/91346935 "Real Direct Realism"], a lecture recorded 2014 at Marc Sanders Foundation, Vimeo.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John R. Searle]].&lt;ref&gt;John R. Searle, ''Seeing Things as They Are: A Theory of Perception'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, epistemological dualism has come under sustained attack by other contemporary philosophers, such as [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] (the [[private language argument]]) and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] in his seminal essay "Empiricism and the Philosophy of Mind". Indirect realism is argued to be problematical because of [[Ryle's regress]] and the [[homunculus argument]]. However, recently reliance on the private language argument and the Homunculus Objection has itself come under attack. It can be argued that those who argue for "inner presence", to use Antti Revonsuo's term,&lt;ref&gt;Revonsuo, Antti (2006) ''Inner Presence:  Consciousness as a Biological Phenomenon,'' Cambridge MA:  MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; are not proposing  a private "referent", with the application of language to it being "private" and thus unshareable, but a ''private'' use of ''public'' language.  There is no doubt that each of us has a private understanding of public language, a notion that has been experimentally supported;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ragnar Rommetveit|Rommetveit, Ragnar]] (1974) ''On Message Structure:  A Framework for the Study of Language and Communication,'' London:  John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt; George Steiner refers to our personal use of language as an "idiolect", one particular to ourselves in its detail.&lt;ref&gt;Steiner, George (1998), ''After Babel:  Aspects of Language and Translation,'' London &amp; New York:  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The question has to be put how a collective use of language can go on when, not only do we have differing understandings of the words we use, but our sensory registrations differ.&lt;ref&gt;Hardin, C. L. (1988) ''Color for Philosophers,'' Indianapolis IN:  Hackett Pub. Co.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against direct realism==

===The argument from illusion===
[[Image:Café wall.svg|250px|thumb|right|Illusion creates a problem for naïve realists as it suggests our senses are fallible, perceiving things that aren't there. In this illusion, the lines are horizontal, despite how they appear.]]
This argument was "first offered in a more or less fully explicit form in [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] ([[Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous|1713]])."&lt;ref name=sep&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/perception-episprob/ Epistemological Problems of Perception], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also referred to as the problem of conflicting appearances (e.g. [[Myles Burnyeat]]'s article ''Conflicting Appearances''). It has been argued that "informed commonsense" indicates that perceptions often depend on organs of perception.&lt;ref name="uor" /&gt; For example, humans would receive visual information very differently if they, like flies, had compound eyes, and may not even be able to imagine how things would appear with entirely different sense organs such as [[infra-red]] detectors or [[acoustic location|echo-location]] devices. Furthermore, perception systems can misrepresent objects even when in full working order, as shown, for example, by [[optical illusion]]s like the [[Müller-Lyer illusion]]. More dramatically, sometimes people perceive things which are not there at all, which can be termed instances of "hallucination" or "perceptual delusion".&lt;ref name=uor&gt;[http://www.rdg.ac.uk/AcaDepts/ld/Philos/jmp/Theory%20of%20Knowledge/NaiveRealism.htm Naïve Realism], [[University of Reading]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Double-alaskan-rainbow.jpg|250px|thumb|right|Illusions are present in nature. [[Rainbows]] are an example of a perceptual delusion. "For, unlike an architectural arch, a rainbow recedes as we approach it, never to be reached."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Gregory|Gregory, Richard.]] (2003). [http://www.perceptionweb.com/perception/perc0303/editorial.pdf Delusions.] ''Perception.'' '''32''', pp. 257-261.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[argument from illusion]] allegedly shows the need to posit sense-data as the immediate objects of perception. In cases of illusion or [[hallucination]], the object has qualities that no public physical object in that situation has and so must be distinct from any such object.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Naïve realism may accommodate these facts as they stand by virtue of its very vagueness (or "open-texture"): it is not specific or detailed enough to be refuted by such cases.&lt;ref name=uor/&gt; A more developed direct realist might respond by showing that various cases of misperception, failed perception, and perceptual relativity do not make it necessary to suppose that sense-data exist. When a stick submerged in water looks bent a direct realist is not compelled to say the stick actually is bent but can say that the stick can have more than one appearance: a straight stick can look bent when light reflected from the stick arrives at one's eye in a crooked pattern, but this appearance is not necessarily a sense-datum in the mind. Similar things can be said about the coin which appears circular from one vantage point and oval-shaped from another. Pressing on your eyeball with a finger creates double vision but assuming the existence of two sense-data is unnecessary: the direct realist can say that they have two eyes, each giving them a different view of the world. Usually the eyes are focused in the same direction; but sometimes they are not.

However, this response is presumably based on previously observed data. If one were to be able to observe nothing other than the stick in the water, with no previous information, it would appear that the stick was bent. Visual depth in particular is a set of inferences, not an actual experience of the space between things in a radial direction outward from the observation point.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Alex. (2003). [http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~lka/conr.htm The Empirical Description of Conscious Experience], ''The Science and Philosophy of Consciousness.''&lt;/ref&gt; If all [[empirical evidence]] is based upon observation then the entire developed memory and knowledge of every perception and of each sense may be as skewed as the bent stick. Since objects with different qualities are experienced from each of the different perspectives there is no apparent experiential basis for regarding one out of any such set of related perceptual experiences as the one in which the relevant physical object is itself immediately experienced. The most reasonable conclusion is that the experienced object is always distinct from the physical object or at least that there is no way to identify which, if any, of the immediately experienced objects is the physical object itself. Epistemologically it is as though physical objects were never given, whether or not that is in fact the case.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Another potential counter-example involves vivid hallucinations: phantom elephants, for instance, might be interpreted as sense-data. A direct realist response would differentiate hallucination from genuine perception: no perception of elephants is going on, only the different and related mental process of hallucination. However, if there are visual images when we hallucinate it seems reasonable that there are visual images when we see. Similarly if dreaming involves visual and auditory images in our minds it seems reasonable to think there are visual and auditory images, or sense-data, when we are awake and perceiving things. This argument has been challenged in a number of different ways. First it has been questioned whether there must be some object present that actually has the experienced qualities, which would then seemingly have to be something like a sense-datum. Why couldn't it be that the perceiver is simply in a state of seeming to experience such an object without any object actually being present? Second, in cases of illusion and perceptual relativity there is an object present which is simply misperceived, usually in readily explainable ways, and no need to suppose that an additional object is also involved. Third, the last part of the perceptual relativity version of the argument has been challenged by questioning whether there is really no experiential difference between veridical and non-veridical perception; and by arguing that even if sense-data are experienced in non-veridical cases and even if the difference between veridical and non-veridical cases is, as claimed, experientially indiscernible, there is still no reason to think that sense-data are the immediate objects of experience in veridical cases. Fourth, do sense-data exist through time or are they momentary? Can they exist when not being perceived? Are they public or private? Can they be themselves misperceived? Do they exist in minds or are they extra-mental, even if not physical? On the basis of the intractability of these questions, it has been argued that the conclusion of the argument from illusion is unacceptable or even unintelligible, even in the absence of a clear diagnosis of exactly where and how it goes wrong.&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

Direct realists can potentially deny the existence of any such thing as a mental image but this is difficult to maintain, since we seem able to visually imagine all sorts of things with ease. Even if perception does not involve images other mental processes like imagination certainly seem to. One view, similar to Reid's, is that we do have images of various sorts in our minds when we perceive, dream, hallucinate and imagine but when we actually perceive things, our sensations cannot be considered objects of perception or attention. The only objects of perception are external objects. Even if perception is accompanied by images, or sensations, it is wrong to say we perceive sensations. Direct realism defines perception as perception of external objects where an "external object" is allowed to be a photon in the eye but not an impulse in a nerve leading from the eye. Recent work in neuroscience suggests a shared ontology for perception, imagination and dreaming, with similar areas of brain being used for all of these.

==Problems with the indirect theory&lt;!--Linked from 'Social constructionism'--&gt;==

A problem with representationalism is that if simple data flow and [[information processing]] is assumed then something in the brain must be interpreting incoming data as a "percept". This something is often described as a [[homunculus]], although the term homunculus is also used to imply an entity that creates a continual [[Regress argument|regress]], and this need not be implied. This suggests that some phenomenon other than simple data flow and [[information processing]] is involved in perception. This is more of an issue now than it was for [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers prior to Newton, such as Descartes, for whom physical processes were poorly defined. Descartes held that there is a "homunculus" in the form of the soul, belonging to a form of natural substance known as ''[[Mental substance|res cogitans]]'' that obeyed different laws from those obeyed by solid matter (''[[res extensa]]''). Although Descartes' duality of natural substances may have echoes in modern physics (Bose and Fermi statistics) no agreed account of 'interpretation' has been formulated. Thus representationalism remains an incomplete description of perception. Aristotle realized this and simply proposed that ideas themselves (representations) must be aware—in other words that there is no further transfer of sense impressions beyond ideas.
[[Image:Rep-perception.jpg|right|thumb|400px|The representational theory of perception]]

A potential difficulty with representational realism is that, if we only have knowledge of representations of the world, how can we know that they resemble in any significant way the objects to which they are supposed to correspond? Any creature with a representation in its brain would need to interact with the objects that are represented to identify them with the representation. This difficulty would seem reasonably to be covered by the learning by exploration of the world that goes on throughout life. However, there may still be a concern that if the external world is only to be [[inference|inferred]], its 'true likeness' might be quite different from our idea of it. The representational realist would answer to this that "true likeness" is an intuitive concept that falls in the face of logic, since a likeness must always depend on the way in which something is considered.

A semantic difficulty may arise when considering [[reference]] in representationalism. If a person says "I see the Eiffel Tower" at a time when they are indeed looking at the Eiffel Tower, to what does the term "Eiffel Tower" refer? The direct realist might say that in the representational account people do not really see the tower but rather 'see' the representation. However, this is a distortion of the meaning of the word see which the representationalist does not imply. For the representationalist the statement refers to the Eiffel Tower, which implicitly is experienced in the form of a representation. The representationalist does not imply that when a person refers to the Eiffel Tower, they are referring to their [[Empirical evidence|sense experience]], and when another person refers to the Tower, they are referring to their sense experience.

Furthermore, representative realism claims that we perceive our perceptual intermediaries-we can attend to them-just as we observe our image in a mirror. However, as we can scientifically verify, this is clearly not true of the physiological components of the perceptual process. This also brings up the problem of [[mind-body dualism|dualism]] and its relation to representative realism, concerning the incongruous marriage of the metaphysical and the physical.

The new objection to the Homunculus Argument claims that it relies on a naive view of sensation.  Because the eyes respond to light rays is no reason for supposing that the visual field requires eyes to see it.  Visual sensation (the argument can be extrapolated to the other senses) bears no direct resemblance to the light rays at the retina, nor to the character of what they are reflected from or pass through or what was glowing at the origin of them.  The reason given is that they only bear the similarities of ''co-variation'' with what arrives at the retinas.&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, Roy Wood (1919), "The epistemology of evolutionary naturalism", Mind, 28:112, 407-26;  se p. 414.&lt;/ref&gt;  Just as the currents in a wire going to a loudspeaker vary proportionately with the sounds that emanate from it but have no other likeness, so too does sensation vary proportionately (and not necessarily directly) with what causes it but bears no other resemblance to the input.  This implies that the colour we experience is actually a cortical occurrence, and that light rays and external surfaces are not themselves coloured.  The proportional variations with which cortical colour changes are there in the external world, but not colour as we experience it.  Contrary to what Gilbert Ryle believed, those who argue for sensations being brain processes do not have to hold that there is a "picture" in the brain since this is impossible according to this theory since actual pictures in the external world are not coloured.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 96-102.&lt;/ref&gt; It is plain that Ryle unthinkingly carried over what the eyes do to the nature of sensation; A. J. Ayer at the time described Ryle's position as "very weak".&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, A. J. (1957) ''The Problem of Knowledge,'' Harmondsworth:  Penguin Books.&lt;/ref&gt; So there is no "screen" in front of cortical "eyes", no mental objects before one. As Thomas Hobbes put it: "How do we take notice of sense?—by sense itself". Moreland Perkins has characterized it thus: that sensing is not like kicking a ball, but rather "kicking a kick".&lt;ref&gt;Hobbes, Thomas (1839 [1655]), ''Elements of Philosophy, The First Section: Concerning Body,'' London: John Bohn, p. 389;  Perkins, Moreland (1983), ''Sensing the World,'' Indianapolis IN: Hackett Pub. Co., pp. 286-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are still philosophers arguing for colour being a property of external surfaces, light sources, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Tye (2006), 'The puzzle of true blue', ''Analysis,'' 66: 173-78;  Matthen, Mohan (2009), 'Truly blue:  an adverbial aspect of perceptual representation', ''Analysis,'' 69:1, 48-54.&lt;/ref&gt;

A more fundamental criticism is implied in theories of this type. The differences at the sensory and perceptual levels between agents require that some means of ensuring at least a partial correlation can be achieved that allows the updatings involved in communication to take place.  The process in an informative statement begins with the parties hypothetically assuming that they are referring to the "same" entity or "property", even though their selections from their sensory fields cannot match; we can call this mutually imagined projection the "logical subject" of the statement.  The speaker then produces the logical predicate which effects the proposed updating of the "referent". If the statement goes through, the hearer will now have a different percept and concept of the "referent"—perhaps even seeing it now as two things and not one. The radical conclusion is that we are premature in conceiving of the external as already sorted into singular "objects" in the first place, since we only need to behave ''as if'' they are already logically singular.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Edmond (2005), ''Narrative, Perception, Language, and Faith,'' Basingstoke:  Palgrave Macmillan, pp. 103-120.&lt;/ref&gt; The diagram at the beginning of this entry would thus be thought of as a false picture of the actual case, since to draw "an" object as already selected from the real is only to treat the practically needful, but strictly false, hypothesis of objects-as-logically-singular as ontologically given. The proponents of this view thus argue that there is no need actually ''to believe'' in the singularity of an object since we can manage perfectly well by ''mutually imagining'' that 'it' is singular.  A proponent of this theory can thus ask the direct realist feels why he or she thinks it is necessary to move to taking the imagining of singularity for real when there is no practical difference in the outcome in action.  Therefore, although there are selections from our sensory fields which for the time being we treat as if they were objects, they are only provisional, open to corrections at any time, and, hence, far from being direct ''representations'' of pre-existing singularities, they retain an experimental character.  Virtual constructs or no, they remain, however, selections that are causally linked to the real and can surprise us at any time—which removes any danger of solipsism in this theory.  This approach dovetails with the philosophy known as [[social constructivism]].&lt;ref&gt;Glasersfeld, Ernst von (1995), ''Radical Constructivism:  A Way of Knowing and Learning,'' London:  RoutledgeFalmer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of experience of a physical object can be altered in major ways by changes in the conditions of perception or of the relevant sense-organs and the resulting [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] processes, without change in the external physical object that initiates this process and that may seem to be depicted by the experience. Conversely any process that yields the same sensory/neural results will yield the same perceptual experience, no matter what the physical object that initiated the process may have been like. Furthermore, the causal process that intervenes between the external object and the perceptual experience takes time, so that the character of the experience reflects, at the most, an earlier stage of that object than the one existing at the moment of perception. As in observations of astronomical objects the external object may have ceased to exist long before the experience occurs. These facts are claimed to point to the conclusion that the direct object of experience is an entity produced at the end of this causal process, distinct from any physical object that initiates the process."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

==The adverbial theory==
The above argument invites the conclusion of a perceptual dualism that raises the issue of how and whether the object can be known by experience. The adverbial theory proposes "that this dualism is a dualism of ''objects'', with perceptual experience being a more direct experience of objects of a different sort, [[sense-data]]."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt; Perceptual dualism implies:&lt;blockquote&gt;both an ''act'' of awareness (or apprehension) and an ''object'' (the sense-datum) which that act apprehends or is an awareness of. The fundamental idea of the adverbial theory, in contrast, is that there is no need for such objects and the problems that they bring with them (such as whether they are physical or mental or somehow neither). Instead, it is suggested, merely the occurrence of a mental act or mental state with its own intrinsic character is enough to account for the character of immediate experience.&lt;ref name="sep" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to the adverbial theory, when, for example, I experience a silver elliptical shape (as when viewing a coin from an angle) I am in a certain specific state of sensing or sensory awareness or of being appeared to: I sense in a certain manner or am appeared to in a certain way, and that specific manner of sensing or of being appeared to accounts for the content of my experience: I am in a certain distinctive sort of experiential state. There need be no object or entity of any sort that is literally silver and elliptical in the material world or in the mind. I experience a silver and [[Ellipse|elliptical]] shape because an object or entity that literally has that color and shape is directly before my mind. But the nature of these entities and the way in which they are related to the mind are difficult to understand. The adverbial theory has the advantage of being metaphysically simpler, avoiding issues about the nature of sense-data, but we gain no real understanding of the nature of the states in question or of how exactly they account for the character of immediate experience."&lt;ref name=sep/&gt;

'''Elizabeth Campbell''' (1893–1971) was an American archeologist, notable for proposing a much earlier date for the presence of man in the desert Southwest than was generally accepted. She worked with her husband William (Bill) Campbell and first proposed that artifacts found along the shores of [[Lake Mojave]] and other [[Pleistocene]] lakes and rivers of the desert West were contemporaneous with the presence of water.  They showed that there were virtually no sites that were not associated with archaic water sources.  They hypothesized that the geologic features associated with the artifacts could be used to date the period of human habitation.  This is the first use of what has become known as [[environmental archaeology]].&lt;ref name='warren2017'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=Claude N.|author-link1=Claude Nelson Warren|last2=Schneider|first2=Joan S.|title=Purple Hummingbird: A Biography of Elizabeth Warder Crozer Campbell|date=2017|publisher=University of Utah Press|isbn=9781607815181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

Elizabeth Crozer was the youngest of four daughters born to upper class parents: John Price Crozer II and Elizabeth Steger Warder Crozer of [[Upland, Pennsylvania]].  She was born on August 11, 1893 at the Crozer summer cottage in [[Beach Haven, New Jersey]].&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;

Her father was the grandson of [[John Price Crozer]], founder of the Crozer textile mills and possessor of the Crozer fortune.&lt;ref name="mcQueen1982"&gt;McQueen, David A. (1982) ''The Crozers of Upland 1723-1926'', Serendipity Wress, Wilmington, Deleware&lt;/ref&gt;  When the elder John Crozer died the younger John Crozer inherited the mills and formed a partnership with his father under the name: S. A. Crozer and Son.  When S. A Crozer died in 1910 John inherited coal companies, an iron and steel company, shared of a railroad and farms.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt; The Crozer family founded the [[Crozer Theological Seminary]], the [[Crozer Arboretum]], and the [[Crozer Quarterly]].  They also built the [[George K. Crozer Mansion]] and are the namesake of the [[Crozer-Keystone Health System]].

Her uncle was [[Hermann Volrath Hilprecht]], professor of Assyriology at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] and a scholar of Near Eastern archaeology.  He was involved in the excavations at the Near Eastern site of [[Nippur]].  Campbell described in her diary how her Aunt Sallie would travel with Hilprecht to Europe and how "..[s]he never let her loveliness interfere with anything.  She climbed the pyramids with three Arabs to push and pull."&lt;ref name="crozer1908"&gt;Crozer, Elizabeth W. (1908) Diary of Elizabeth Crozer.  Manuscript on file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives, Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;

Campbell was schooled at home by a French tutor until age fourteen.&lt;ref name="JTNP"&gt;Elizabeth Campbell - Joshua Tree National Park (U.S. National Park Service),  https://www.nps.gov/jotr/learn/historyculture/campbell.htm, Retrieved April 15, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall of 1909 she began attending Miss Irwin's School (later the Agnes Irwin School) and graduated in 1911.  Until World War II the education of most daughters of Philadelphia high society who attended Miss Irwin's ended at the secondary level.&lt;ref&gt;Baltzell, Edward Digby, (1989) ''Philadelphia Gentlemen: The Making of a National Upper Class'', Transaction Publishers, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;  This was Campbell's last formal education.

Campbell married William (Bill) Campbell in May 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Antevs, Ernst, (1945) "William Henry Campbell, 1895-1944",  ''American Antiquity'', 10(4) pp 379-382.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bill had served in World War I and had been gassed two days before the armistice of November 11, 1918.&lt;ref name='warren2017'/&gt;  Bill's lung damage due to exposure to mustard gas caused them to move to [[Los Angeles, California]] and later to the drier climes of [[Twentynine Palms, California|Twentynine Palms]] where they established a homestead.

When Campbell's father died in 1926 she inherited a trust&lt;ref name="JTNP"/&gt; that enabled her and Bill to live comfortably for the rest of their lives.  The Campbells were considered pillars of the Twentynine Palms community and developed a reputation as benefactors of both individual and community endeavours.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, Joseph, "The Late, Great American WASP", ''Wall Street Journal'', December 21–22, 2013: C1-C2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bagley1978"&gt;Bagley, Hellen, 1978) ''Sand in My Shoe:  Homestead Days in Twentynine Palms'', Homestead Publishers, Twentynine Palms, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Campbells maintained their residence in Twentynine Palms, and lived in a summer home on the shores of [[Lake Tahoe]], near [[Glenbrook, Nevada]].  It was here that Bill died in June 1944.  After Bill's death Campbell sold the house in Twentynine Palms and moved to [[Carson City, Nevada]] where she met and married Joe Cecil Turman.  The marriage lasted a short time before it was annulled.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  She moved to [[Tucson, Arizona]] around 1952 where she lived until 1961.

While living in Tucson she became a research associate with the [[Arizona State Museum]]&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt; and continued to work on the collections she and Bill had assembled over the years.  In 1957 she had Arizona State Museum exhibit designer Robert Baker design a laboratory on the second floor of her Tucson home.&lt;ref name="baker1957"&gt;Baker, Robert G, (1957) Drawing of a plan for archaeological laboratory for Tucson home of Elizabeth W.C. Campbell.  Elizabeth Crozer Campbell file, Administrative Records, Arizona State Museum Archives, University of Arizona, Tucson (File 129A)&lt;/ref&gt;  During this time she also wrote a memoir about homesteading in Twentynine Palms, ''The Desert was Home.''&lt;ref name="campbell1961"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer, (1961) ''The Desert Was Home'', Westernlore Press, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell made a trip to Twentynine Palms for an event marking the publication of her book and made the decision to move back there.  She remained in Twentynine Palms for the rest of her life.&lt;ref name="bagley1978"/&gt;  Elizabeth Campbell died on December 21, 1971.  She was cremated and her cremains were interred alongside those of her husband Bill in a single plot in Twentynine Palms Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Warder "Betty" Crozer Campbell - Find a Grave Memorial, https://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=92706255, accessed April 20, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Her obituary was published in ''The Masterkey.''&lt;ref&gt;(1972) Obit for Elizabeth Crozer Campbell, ''The Masterkey'' Vol. 46, No. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career in Archaeology ==

Campbell developed an interest in archaeology after she and Bill moved to Twentynine Palms. She began collecting arrowheads from nearby sand dunes while gathering firewood.  When Bill McHaney, an old prospector who often visited their camp, told stories about Indian culture and caches of pottery, she listened and took notes.&lt;ref name="JTNP"/&gt;  They would drive their trusty automobile -- "The Ship of the Desert"&lt;ref name='campbell1961'/&gt;—into the surrounding countryside looking for archaeological sites and visiting locations that McHaney told them about.  It was said that archaeology met Campbell's need for "intellectual effort and accomplishment" and ameliorated the lonely desert life.&lt;ref name='bagley1978'/&gt;  The Campbells were among the earliest archaeologists in the California desert.  At the time (1925) virtually nothing was known about how long humans had lived in the deserts and the use of [[stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphy]] as a means of chronological ordering of archaeological assemblages was just beginning.&lt;ref name='warren2017'/&gt;

Campbell's first monograph was published by the [[Southwest Museum of the American Indian|Southwest Museum]] in 1931.&lt;ref name="crozer1931a"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth Crozer, (1931) ''An Archaeological Reconnaissance of the Twenty Nine Palms Region'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 7,  Southwest Museum, Pasadena, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1932 the Campbells were appointed fellows in archaeology of the Southwest Museum and hosted a conference in Twentynine Palms on April 22–23 of that year.&lt;ref name="hinchman1932"&gt;Hinchman, Fred K, (1932) "Southwestern Archaeological Federation at Twenty-Nine Palms.", ''The Masterkey'', 6(2):52-56&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 the Campbells began their investigation of [[Pinto Basin]].  The area is associated with an extinct river channel and a dry lake bed.&lt;ref name="campbellAmsden1934"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth Crozer and Charles Amsden, (1934) "The Eagle Mountain Site.", ''The Masterkey'', 8(6):170-173&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CampbellCampbell1935"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer and William Campbell, (1935) ''The Pinto Basin Site: An Ancient Aboriginal Camping Ground in the California Desert'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 9, Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, California.&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell began consulting with geologists and paleontologists at the [[California Institute of Technology]].  Geologist David Scharf authored the geological chapter of the Pinto Basin report in one of the first collaborations of geologists and archaeologists.  The artifacts from Pinto Basin were associated with the dry stream channel known as [[Pinto Wash]] and the lake bed known as [[Palen Dry Lake]].  This suggested that these sites were occupied during the period of time when the desert was considerably wetter.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  The Campbells argued that this wet period was not recent and presented as evidence the ground-water level being 97 feet below the surface of the surrounding arid mountain ranges.  Starting with the Pinto Basin report, and for all research after, Campbell collaborated and consulted with well-known professionals in the fields of geology, paleontology, and archaeology.  This increased her professional status and standing with the archaeological community.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;

In early 1934 the Campbells collected artifacts from the high shorelines of [[Silver Lake (Mojave)|Silver Lake]] playa (the northern basin of Lake Mojave) and in 1935 they collected from the shorelines of [[Soda Lake (San Bernardino County)|Soda Lake]] playa (the southern basin of Lake Mojave).  Campbell stated she and Bill wanted to become experts in [[Dry Lake|playa]] culture.&lt;ref name="campbell1935"&gt;Typewritten report from Elizabeth Campbell to the National Park Service on 1935 reconnaissance carried out in San Bernardino County.  On file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives., Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;  Campbell believed that most ancient sites would be located in the [[Great Basin]].&lt;ref name="campbell1937"&gt;Typewritten report from Elizabeth Campbell to the National Park Service on 1937 reconnaissance carried out in San Bernardino County.  On file in the Joshua Tree National Park archives., Twentynine Palms, California&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1936 Campbell published her seminal paper "Archaeological Problems in the Southern California Deserts"&lt;ref name="campbell1936a"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W. Crozer, (1936) Archaeological Problems in the Southern California Deserts, ''American Antiquity'', 1(4) pp 235-300&lt;/ref&gt; in which she outlined her hypothesis that associated prehistoric peoples with certain landforms.  She believed a thorough study of the spatial relationships of artifact assemblages to the landscape would illuminate their chronology.&lt;ref name="warren2017"/&gt;  This approach is clearly laid out in the Lake Mohave report&lt;ref name="campbellCampbell1937"&gt;Campbell, Elizabeth W.C., William H. Campbell, Ernst Anteves, Charles E. Amsden, J.A. Barbieri and F.D. Bode, (1937) "The Lake Mohave Site" in ''The Archaeology of Pleistocene Lake Mohave: A Symposium'', Southwest Museum Papers No. 11:9, Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, California&lt;/ref&gt; where she wrote: {{quote|text=In order to prove that a site has great age, it should be a pure site; that is, the artifacts should represent one period only, and it should be situated where the geology of the regions points to antiquity. For this reason we have sought man's ancient remains along extinct river channels and about the strand lines of playas and fossil lakes, indicated as such by beaches, terraces, spits, and wave-cut cliffs -- mute testimony to a past day of moister climate.  We have not be disappointed in our search for locations by geological indication, for during the last two years the Desert Laboratory of the Southwest Museum has found and studied ten sites of the desired type.  As all of these are now far from water, their occupants no doubt belonged to a period of greater rainfall.}}

'''Epigenetics''' is the study of heritable [[phenotype]] changes that do not involve alterations in the [[DNA sequence]].&lt;ref name="Epigenetics 2009 review"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dupont C, Armant DR, Brenner CA | title = Epigenetics: definition, mechanisms and clinical perspective | journal = Seminars in Reproductive Medicine | volume = 27 | issue = 5 | pages = 351–57 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19711245 | pmc = 2791696 | doi = 10.1055/s-0029-1237423 | quote = In the original sense of this definition, epigenetics referred to all molecular pathways modulating the expression of a genotype into a particular phenotype. Over the following years, with the rapid growth of genetics, the meaning of the word has gradually narrowed. Epigenetics has been defined and today is generally accepted as "the study of changes in gene function that are mitotically and/or meiotically heritable and that do not entail a change in DNA sequence."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] prefix ''[[wikt:epi-|epi-]]'' ({{wikt-lang|grc|ἐπι-}} "over, outside of, around") in ''epigenetics'' implies features that are "on top of" or "in addition to" the traditional [[gene]]tic basis for inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Beware the pseudo gene genies |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/19/epigenetics-dna--darwin-adam-rutherford |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Epigenetics most often denotes changes that affect gene activity and [[gene expression|expression]], but can also be used to describe any heritable phenotypic change. Such effects on [[cell (biology)|cellular]] and [[physiology|physiological]] [[phenotypic trait]]s may result from external or [[environment (biophysical)|environmental]] factors, or be part of normal developmental program. The standard definition of epigenetics requires these alterations to be heritable,&lt;ref name="nature2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid19339683" /&gt; either in the progeny of cells or of organisms.

The term also refers to the changes themselves: functionally relevant changes to the genome that do not involve a change in the [[nucleotide sequence]]. Examples of mechanisms that produce such changes are [[DNA methylation]] and [[histone modification]], each of which alters how genes are expressed without altering the underlying [[DNA]] sequence. Gene expression can be controlled through the action of [[repressor protein]]s that attach to [[silencer (DNA)|silencer]] regions of the DNA. These epigenetic changes may last through [[cell division]]s for the duration of the cell's life, and may also last for multiple generations even though they do not involve changes in the underlying DNA sequence of the organism;&lt;ref name="pmid17522671"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bird A | title=Perceptions of epigenetics | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume=447 | issue=7143 | pages=396–98 | date=May 2007 | pmid=17522671 | doi=10.1038/nature05913 | bibcode=2007Natur.447..396B }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead, non-genetic factors cause the organism's genes to behave (or "express themselves") differently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140 |title=What genes remember |author=Hunter, Philip |magazine=Prospect Magazine |issue=146 |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=1 May 2008 |accessdate=26 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080501094940/http://www.prospect-magazine.co.uk/article_details.php?id=10140 |archivedate=1 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One example of an epigenetic change in [[eukaryotic]] biology is the process of [[cellular differentiation]]. During [[morphogenesis]], [[totipotent]] [[stem cells]] become the various [[pluripotent]] [[cell line]]s of the [[embryo]], which in turn become fully differentiated cells. In other words, as a single fertilized egg cell – the [[zygote]] – continues to [[mitosis|divide]], the resulting daughter cells change into all the different cell types in an organism, including [[neurons]], [[muscle cells]], [[epithelium]], [[endothelium]] of [[blood vessels]], etc., by activating some genes while inhibiting the expression of others.&lt;ref name="pmid17522676"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Reik W | title=Stability and flexibility of epigenetic gene regulation in mammalian development | journal=Nature | volume=447 | issue=7143 | pages=425–32 | date=May 2007 | pmid=17522676 | doi=10.1038/nature05918 | bibcode=2007Natur.447..425R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, some phenomena not necessarily heritable have also been described as epigenetic. For example, the term epigenetic has been used to describe any modification of chromosomal regions, especially histone modifications, whether or not these changes are heritable or associated with a phenotype. The consensus definition now requires a trait to be heritable for it to be considered epigenetic.&lt;ref name="pmid19339683" /&gt;

==Definitions==
The term ''epigenetics'' in its contemporary usage emerged in the 1990s, but for some years has been used in somewhat variable meanings.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://global.oup.com/academic/product/the-developing-genome-9780199922345?cc=us&amp;lang=en&amp;|title=The Developing Genome: An Introduction to Behavioral Epigenetics|last=Moore|first=David S.|date=2015|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0199922345|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; A consensus definition of the concept of ''epigenetic trait'' as "stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence" was formulated at a [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] meeting in 2008,&lt;ref name="pmid19339683"/&gt; although alternate definitions that include non-heritable traits are still being used.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt;

===Historical===

The term ''epigenesis'' has a generic meaning "extra growth". It has been used in English since the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford English Dictionary]]: "The word is used by W. Harvey, ''Exercitationes'' 1651, p. 148, and in the ''English Anatomical Exercitations'' 1653, p. 272. It is explained to mean ‘partium super-exorientium additamentum’, ‘the additament of parts budding one out of another’."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waddington's canalisation, 1940s===

From the generic meaning, and the associated adjective ''epigenetic'', [[C. H. Waddington]] coined the term ''epigenetics'' in 1942 as pertaining to ''[[epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]]'', in parallel to [[Valentin Haecker]]'s 'phenogenetics' ({{lang|de|Phänogenetik}}).&lt;ref name=waddington&gt;{{cite journal|author=Waddington, C. H. | title=The epigenotype| journal=Endeavour | volume=1 | pages=18–20 |doi= | year=1942 }}
"For the purpose of a study of inheritance, the relation between phenotypes and genotypes [...] is, from a wider biological point of view, of crucial importance, since it is the kernel of the whole problem of development. Many geneticists have recognized this and attempted to discover the processes involved in the mechanism by which the genes of the genotype bring about phenotypic effects. The first step in such an enterprise is – or rather should be, since it is often omitted by those with an undue respect for the powers of reason – to describe what can be seen of the developmental processes. For enquiries of this kind, the word 'phenogenetics' was coined by Haecker [1918, {{lang|de|Phänogenetik}}]. The second and more important part of the task is to discover the causal mechanisms at work, and to relate them as far as possible to what experimental embryology has already revealed of the mechanics of development. We might use the name 'epigenetics' for such studies, thus emphasizing their relation to the concepts, so strongly favourable to the classical theory of epigenesis, which have been reached by the experimental embryologists. We certainly need to remember that between genotype and phenotype, and connecting them to each other, there lies a whole complex of developmental processes. It is convenient to have a name for this complex: 'epigenotype' seems suitable."
&lt;/ref&gt; ''Epigenesis'' in the context of the biology of that period referred to the differentiation of cells from their initial [[totipotent]] state in embryonic development.&lt;ref&gt;See ''[[preformationism]]'' for historical background. ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'':
"the theory that the germ is brought into existence (by successive accretions), and not merely developed, in the process of reproduction. [...] The opposite theory was formerly known as the 'theory of evolution'; to avoid the ambiguity of this name, it is now spoken of chiefly as the 'theory of preformation', sometimes as that of 'encasement' or 'emboîtement'."&lt;/ref&gt;

When Waddington coined the term, the physical nature of genes and their role in heredity was not known; he used it as a conceptual model of how genes might interact with their surroundings to produce a phenotype; he used the phrase "epigenetic landscape" as a metaphor for [[morphogenesis|biological development]]. Waddington held that cell fates were [[canalisation (genetics)|established in development (canalisation)]] much as a marble rolls down to the point of [[local optimum|lowest local elevation]].&lt;ref name="Waddington2014"&gt;{{cite book |author=Waddington, C. H.  |title=The Epigenetics of Birds |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lqKTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR1 |date=1953 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-44047-0 |pages=1–}} (2014 edition)&lt;/ref&gt;

Waddington suggested visualising increasing irreversibility of cell type differentiation as ridges rising between the valleys where the marbles (cells) are travelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Hall BK | title=In search of evolutionary developmental mechanisms: the 30-year gap between 1944 and 1974 | journal=302 | issue=1 | pages=5–18 | date=15 January 2004 | pmid=14760651 | doi=10.1002/jez.b.20002 | volume=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times Waddington's notion of the epigenetic landscape has been rigorously formalized in the context of the [[system dynamics|systems dynamics]] state approach to the study of cell-fate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Alvarez-Buylla ER, Chaos A, Aldana M, Benítez M, Cortes-Poza Y, Espinosa-Soto C, Hartasánchez DA, Lotto RB, Malkin D, Escalera Santos GJ, Padilla-Longoria P | title=Floral Morphogenesis: Stochastic Explorations of a Gene Network Epigenetic Landscape | journal=PLoS ONE | date=November 3, 2008 | pmid=18978941 | doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003626 |doi-access=free  |bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.3626A | volume=3 | issue=11 | pages=e3626 | pmc=2572848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Rabajante JF, Babierra AL | title=Branching and oscillations in the epigenetic landscape of cell-fate determination | journal=Progress in Biophysics and Molecular Biology | volume=117 | issue=2–3 | pages=240–49 | date=January 30, 2015 | pmid=25641423 | doi =10.1016/j.pbiomolbio.2015.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell-fate determination is predicted to exhibit certain dynamics, such as attractor-convergence (the attractor can be an equilibrium point, limit cycle or [[strange attractor]]) or oscillatory.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

===Developmental psychology===

The term "epigenetic" has also been used in [[developmental psychology]] to describe psychological development as the result of an ongoing, bi-directional interchange between heredity and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Gottlieb, G. | year=1991 | title=Epigenetic systems view of human development | url=| journal=Developmental Psychology | volume=27 | issue=1| pages=33–34 | doi=10.1037/0012-1649.27.1.33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactivist ideas of development have been discussed in various forms and under various names throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. An early version was proposed, among the founding statements in [[embryology]], by [[Karl Ernst von Baer]] and popularized by [[Ernst Haeckel]]. A radical epigenetic view (physiological epigenesis) was developed by [[Paul Wintrebert]]. Another variation, probabilistic epigenesis, was presented by [[Gilbert Gottlieb]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert Gottlieb. [http://chd.ucsd.edu/_files/winter2009/Gottlieb.probabilistic.pdf Probabilistic epigenesis], Developmental Science 10:1 (2007), 1–11&lt;/ref&gt; This view encompasses all of the possible developing factors on an organism and how they not only influence the organism and each other, but how the organism also influences its own development.

The developmental psychologist [[Erik Erikson]] wrote of an ''epigenetic principle'' in his book [[Erik Erikson#Bibliography|''Identity: Youth and Crisis'' (1968)]], encompassing the notion that we develop through an unfolding of our personality in predetermined stages, and that our environment and surrounding culture influence how we progress through these stages. This biological unfolding in relation to our socio-cultural settings is done in [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|stages of psychosocial development]], where "progress through each stage is in part determined by our success, or lack of success, in all the previous stages."&lt;ref name=Boeree1997&gt;Boeree, C. George, (1997/2006), [http://www.social-psychology.de/do/pt_erikson.pdf ''Personality Theories, Erik Erikson'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Erikson|first=Erik|title=Identity: Youth and Crisis|year=1968|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company |location=Chapter 3|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio-medicine.org/biology-definition/Epigenetics|title=Epigenetics|publisher= Bio-Medicine.org|accessdate=21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
[[Robin Holliday]] defined epigenetics as "the study of the mechanisms of temporal and spatial control of gene activity during the development of complex organisms."&lt;ref name="pmid2265224"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Holliday R | title=DNA Methylation and Epigenetic Inheritance | journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. Series B, Biological Sciences | volume=326 | issue=1235 | pages=329–38 |date=Jan 30, 1990 | doi =10.1098/rstb.1990.0015 |bibcode = 1990RSPTB.326..329H }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus ''epigenetic'' can be used to describe anything other than DNA sequence that influences the development of an organism.

The more recent usage of the word in science has a stricter definition. It is, as defined by [[Arthur Riggs (geneticist)|Arthur Riggs]] and colleagues, "the study of [[mitosis|mitotically]] and/or [[meiosis|meiotically]] heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in DNA sequence."&lt;ref name="isbn0-87969-490-4"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Riggs AD, Russo VE, Martienssen RA | title=Epigenetic mechanisms of gene regulation | publisher=Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press | location=Plainview, NY | year=1996 | pages=| isbn=0-87969-490-4 | oclc=| doi=}}{{page needed|date=August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "epigenetics", however, has been used to describe processes which have not been demonstrated to be heritable such as some forms of histone modification; there are therefore attempts to redefine it in broader terms that would avoid the constraints of requiring heritability. For example, [[Adrian Peter Bird|Adrian Bird]] defined epigenetics as "the structural adaptation of chromosomal regions so as to register, signal or perpetuate altered activity states."&lt;ref name="pmid17522671" /&gt; This definition would be inclusive of transient modifications associated with [[DNA repair]] or [[cell-cycle]] phases as well as stable changes maintained across multiple cell generations, but exclude others such as templating of membrane architecture and [[prions]] unless they impinge on chromosome function. Such redefinitions however are not universally accepted and are still subject to dispute.&lt;ref name="nature2008"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ledford H | title=Disputed definitions | journal=Nature | volume=455 | issue=7216 | pages=1023–28 | year=2008 | pmid=18948925 | doi=10.1038/4551023a }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] "Roadmap Epigenomics Project", ongoing as of 2016, uses the following definition: "For purposes of this program, epigenetics refers to both heritable changes in gene activity and expression (in the progeny of cells or of individuals) and also stable, long-term alterations in the transcriptional potential of a cell that are not necessarily heritable."&lt;ref name="NIH"&gt;{{cite web |work=NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Project |url=http://www.roadmapepigenomics.org/overview |title=Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, a consensus definition of the epigenetic trait, "stably heritable phenotype resulting from changes in a chromosome without alterations in the DNA sequence", was made at a [[Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory|Cold Spring Harbor]] meeting.&lt;ref name="pmid19339683"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Berger SL, Kouzarides T, Shiekhattar R, Shilatifard A | title=An operational definition of epigenetics |journal=[[Genes &amp; Development]] | volume=23 | issue=7 | pages=781–83 | year=2009 | pmid=19339683 | pmc=3959995 | doi=10.1101/gad.1787609 | url=http://genesdev.cshlp.org/content/23/7/781.full }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The similarity of the word to "genetics" has generated many parallel usages. The "epigenome" is a parallel to the word "genome", referring to the overall epigenetic state of a cell, and [[epigenomics]] refers to more global analyses of epigenetic changes across the entire genome.&lt;ref name="NIH"/&gt; The phrase "[[genetic code]]" has also been adapted – the "[[epigenetic code]]" has been used to describe the set of epigenetic features that create different phenotypes in different cells. Taken to its extreme, the "epigenetic code" could represent the total state of the cell, with the position of each molecule accounted for in an ''epigenomic map'', a diagrammatic representation of the gene expression, DNA methylation and histone modification status of a particular genomic region. More typically, the term is used in reference to systematic efforts to measure specific, relevant forms of epigenetic information such as the [[histone code hypothesis|histone code]] or [[DNA methylation]] patterns.

==Molecular basis==
Epigenetic changes modify the activation of certain genes, but not the genetic code sequence of DNA. The microstructure (not code) of DNA itself or the associated [[chromatin]] proteins may be modified, causing activation or silencing. This mechanism enables differentiated cells in a multicellular organism to express only the genes that are necessary for their own activity. Epigenetic changes are preserved when cells divide. Most epigenetic changes only occur within the course of one individual organism's lifetime; however, these epigenetic changes can be transmitted to the organism's offspring through a process called [[transgenerational epigenetic inheritance]].  Moreover, if gene inactivation occurs in a sperm or egg cell that results in fertilization, this epigenetic modification may also be transferred to the next generation.&lt;ref name="pmid17320501"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chandler VL | title=Paramutation: from maize to mice | journal=Cell | volume=128 | issue=4 | pages=641–45 | date=February 2007 | pmid=17320501 | doi=10.1016/j.cell.2007.02.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Techniques used to study epigenetics ===
Epigenetic research uses a wide range of [[molecular biology|molecular biological]] techniques to further understanding of epigenetic phenomena, including [[chromatin immunoprecipitation]] (together with its large-scale variants [[ChIP-on-chip]] and [[ChIP-Seq]]), [[fluorescent in situ hybridization]], methylation-sensitive [[restriction enzymes]], DNA adenine methyltransferase identification ([[DamID]]) and [[bisulfite sequencing]].&lt;ref name="verma"&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3925982|year=2013|author1=Verma|first1=M|title=Epigenetic Research in Cancer Epidemiology: Trends, Opportunities, and Challenges|journal=Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention|volume=23|issue=2|pages=223–33|last2=Rogers|first2=S|last3=Divi|first3=R.

==Mechanisms==
Several types of epigenetic inheritance systems may play a role in what has become known as cell memory,&lt;ref name="jablonka92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Jablonka E, Lamb MJ, Lachmann M | title=Evidence, mechanisms and models for the inheritance of acquired characteristics | journal=[[J.

===Covalent modifications===
[[Covalent]] modifications of either DNA (e.g. cytosine methylation and hydroxymethylation) or of histone proteins (e.g. lysine acetylation, lysine and arginine methylation, serine and threonine phosphorylation, and lysine ubiquitination and sumoylation) play central roles in many types of epigenetic inheritance. Therefore, the word "epigenetics" is sometimes used as a synonym for these processes. However, this can be misleading. Chromatin remodeling is not always inherited, and not all epigenetic inheritance involves chromatin remodeling.&lt;ref name="pmid17407749"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ptashne M | title=On the use of the word 'epigenetic' | journal=Curr. Biol. | volume=17 | issue=7 | pages=R233–36 | date=April 2007 | pmid=17407749 | doi=10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.030 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nucleosome 1KX5 2.png|thumb|DNA associates with histone proteins to form chromatin.]]
Because the [[phenotype]] of a cell or individual is affected by which of its genes are transcribed, heritable [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription states]] can give rise to epigenetic effects. There are several layers of regulation of [[gene expression]]. One way that genes are regulated is through the remodeling of chromatin. Chromatin is the complex of DNA and the [[histone]] proteins with which it associates. If the way that DNA is wrapped around the histones changes, gene expression can change as well. Chromatin remodeling is accomplished through two main mechanisms:
# The first way is [[post translational modification]] of the amino acids that make up histone proteins. Histone proteins are made up of long chains of amino acids. If the amino acids that are in the chain are changed, the shape of the histone might be modified. DNA is not completely unwound during replication. It is possible, then, that the modified histones may be carried into each new copy of the DNA. Once there, these histones may act as templates, initiating the surrounding new histones to be shaped in the new manner. By altering the shape of the histones around them, these modified histones would ensure that a lineage-specific transcription program is maintained after cell division.
# The second way is the addition of methyl groups to the DNA, mostly at [[CpG site]]s, to convert [[cytosine]] to [[5-methylcytosine]]. 5-Methylcytosine performs much like a regular cytosine, pairing with a guanine in double-stranded DNA. However, some areas of the genome are methylated more heavily than others, and highly methylated areas tend to be less transcriptionally active, through a mechanism not fully understood. Methylation of cytosines can also persist from the germ line of one of the parents into the zygote, marking the chromosome as being inherited from one parent or the other ([[genetic imprinting]]).

Mechanisms of heritability of histone state are not well understood; however, much is known about the mechanism of heritability of DNA methylation state during cell division and differentiation. Heritability of methylation state depends on certain enzymes (such as [[DNA methyltransferase|DNMT1]]) that have a higher affinity for 5-methylcytosine than for cytosine. If this enzyme reaches a "hemimethylated" portion of DNA (where 5-methylcytosine is in only one of the two DNA strands) the enzyme will methylate the other half.

Although histone modifications occur throughout the entire sequence, the unstructured N-termini of histones (called histone tails) are particularly highly modified. These modifications include [[acetylation]], [[methylation]], [[ubiquitylation]], [[phosphorylation]], [[sumoylation]], ribosylation and citrullination. Acetylation is the most highly studied of these modifications. For example, acetylation of the K14 and K9 [[lysine]]s of the tail of histone H3 by histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) is generally related to transcriptional competence.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

One mode of thinking is that this tendency of acetylation to be associated with "active" transcription is biophysical in nature. Because it normally has a positively charged nitrogen at its end, lysine can bind the negatively charged phosphates of the DNA backbone. The acetylation event converts the positively charged amine group on the side chain into a neutral amide linkage. This removes the positive charge, thus loosening the DNA from the histone. When this occurs, complexes like [[SWI/SNF]] and other transcriptional factors can bind to the DNA and allow transcription to occur. This is the "cis" model of epigenetic function. In other words, changes to the histone tails have a direct effect on the DNA itself.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

Another model of epigenetic function is the "trans" model. In this model, changes to the histone tails act indirectly on the DNA. For example, lysine acetylation may create a binding site for chromatin-modifying enzymes (or transcription machinery as well). This chromatin remodeler can then cause changes to the state of the chromatin. Indeed, a bromodomain – a protein domain that specifically binds acetyl-lysine – is found in many enzymes that help activate transcription, including the [[SWI/SNF]] complex. It may be that acetylation acts in this and the previous way to aid in transcriptional activation.

The idea that modifications act as docking modules for related factors is borne out by [[histone methylation]] as well. Methylation of lysine 9 of histone H3 has long been associated with constitutively transcriptionally silent chromatin (constitutive [[heterochromatin]]). It has been determined that a chromodomain (a domain that specifically binds methyl-lysine) in the transcriptionally repressive protein [[Heterochromatin Protein 1|HP1]] recruits HP1 to K9 methylated regions. One example that seems to refute this biophysical model for methylation is that tri-methylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 is strongly associated with (and required for full) transcriptional activation. Tri-methylation in this case would introduce a fixed positive charge on the tail.

It has been shown that the histone lysine methyltransferase (KMT) is responsible for this methylation activity in the pattern of histones H3 &amp; H4. This enzyme utilizes a catalytically active site called the SET domain (Suppressor of variegation, Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax). The SET domain is a 130-amino acid sequence involved in modulating gene activities. This domain has been demonstrated to bind to the histone tail and causes the methylation of the histone.&lt;ref name="pmid9487389"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Jenuwein T, Laible G, Dorn R, Reuter G | title=SET domain proteins modulate chromatin domains in eu- and heterochromatin | journal=Cell. Mol. Life Sci. | volume=54 | issue=1 | pages=80–93 | date=January 1998 | pmid=9487389 | doi=10.1007/s000180050127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differing histone modifications are likely to function in differing ways; acetylation at one position is likely to function differently from acetylation at another position. Also, multiple modifications may occur at the same time, and these modifications may work together to change the behavior of the [[nucleosome]]. The idea that multiple dynamic modifications regulate gene transcription in a systematic and reproducible way is called the [[histone code]], although the idea that histone state can be read linearly as a digital information carrier has been largely debunked. One of the best-understood systems that orchestrates chromatin-based silencing is the [[SIR protein]] based silencing of the yeast hidden mating type loci HML and HMR.

DNA methylation frequently occurs in repeated sequences, and helps to suppress the expression and mobility of '[[transposable elements]]':&lt;ref name="slotkin2007"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Slotkin RK, Martienssen R | title=Transposable elements and the epigenetic regulation of the genome | journal=Nature Reviews Genetics | volume=8 | issue=4 | pages=272–85 | date=April 2007 | pmid=17363976 | doi=10.1038/nrg2072 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because [[5-methylcytosine]] can be spontaneously deaminated (replacing nitrogen by oxygen) to [[thymidine]], CpG sites are frequently mutated and become rare in the genome, except at [[CpG islands]] where they remain unmethylated. Epigenetic changes of this type thus have the potential to direct increased frequencies of permanent genetic mutation. [[DNA methylation]] patterns are known to be established and modified in response to environmental factors by a complex interplay of at least three independent [[DNA methyltransferase]]s, DNMT1, DNMT3A, and DNMT3B, the loss of any of which is lethal in mice.&lt;ref name="li92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Li E, Bestor TH, Jaenisch R | title=Targeted mutation of the DNA methyltransferase gene results in embryonic lethality | journal=Cell | volume=69 | issue=6 | pages=915–26 | date=June 1992 | pmid=1606615 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90611-F }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNMT1 is the most abundant methyltransferase in somatic cells,&lt;ref name="robertson99"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Robertson KD, Uzvolgyi E, Liang G, Talmadge C, Sumegi J, Gonzales FA, Jones PA | title=The human DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) 1, 3a and 3b: coordinate mRNA expression in normal tissues and overexpression in tumors | journal=Nucleic Acids Res. | volume=27 | issue=11 | pages=2291–98 | date=June 1999 | pmid=10325416 | pmc=148793 | doi=10.1093/nar/27.11.2291 }}&lt;/ref&gt; localizes to replication foci,&lt;ref name="leonhardt92"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Leonhardt H, Page AW, Weier HU, Bestor TH | title=A targeting sequence directs DNA methyltransferase to sites of DNA replication in mammalian nuclei | journal=Cell | volume=71 | issue=5 | pages=865–73 | date=November 1992 | pmid=1423634 | doi=10.1016/0092-8674(92)90561-P }}&lt;/ref&gt; has a 10–40-fold preference for hemimethylated DNA and interacts with the [[proliferating cell nuclear antigen]] (PCNA).&lt;ref name="chuang97"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chuang LS, Ian HI, Koh TW, Ng HH, Xu G, Li BF | title=Human DNA-(cytosine-5) methyltransferase-PCNA complex as a target for p21WAF1 | journal=Science | volume=277 | issue=5334 | pages=1996–2000 | date=September 1997 | pmid=9302295 | doi=10.1126/science.277.5334.1996 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Histones H3 and H4 can also be manipulated through demethylation using histone lysine demethylase (KDM). This recently identified enzyme has a catalytically active site called the Jumonji domain (JmjC). The demethylation occurs when JmjC utilizes multiple cofactors to hydroxylate the methyl group, thereby removing it. JmjC is capable of demethylating mono-, di-, and tri-methylated substrates.&lt;ref name="pmid19234061"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Nottke A, Colaiácovo MP, Shi Y | title=Developmental roles of the histone lysine demethylases | journal=Development | volume=136 | issue=6 | pages=879–89 | date=March 2009 | pmid=19234061 | pmc=2692332 | doi=10.1242/dev.020966 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===RNA transcripts===
Sometimes a gene, after being turned on, transcribes a product that (directly or indirectly) maintains the activity of that gene. For example, [[Hnf4]] and [[MyoD]] enhance the transcription of many liver- and muscle-specific genes, respectively, including their own, through the [[transcription factor]] activity of the [[proteins]] they encode. RNA signalling includes differential recruitment of a hierarchy of generic chromatin modifying complexes and DNA methyltransferases to specific loci by RNAs during differentiation and development.&lt;ref name="pmid19154003"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Mattick JS, Amaral PP, Dinger ME, Mercer TR, Mehler MF | title=RNA regulation of epigenetic processes | journal=BioEssays | volume=31 | issue=1 | pages=51–59 | date=January 2009 | pmid=19154003 | doi=10.1002/bies.080099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other epigenetic changes are mediated by the production of [[alternative splicing|different splice forms]] of [[RNA]], or by formation of double-stranded RNA ([[RNAi]]). Descendants of the cell in which the gene was turned on will inherit this activity, even if the original stimulus for gene-activation is no longer present. These genes are often turned on or off by [[signal transduction]], although in some systems where [[syncytia]] or [[gap junction]]s are important, RNA may spread directly to other cells or nuclei by [[diffusion]]. A large amount of RNA and protein is contributed to the [[zygote]] by the mother during [[oogenesis]] or via [[nurse cell]]s, resulting in [[maternal effect]] phenotypes. A smaller quantity of sperm RNA is transmitted from the father, but there is recent evidence that this epigenetic information can lead to visible changes in several generations of offspring.&lt;ref name="choi06"&gt;{{cite web|last=Choi |first=Charles Q. |title=RNA can be hereditary molecule |website=The Scientist |url=https://ukessay.com/blog/rna-can-be-hereditary-molecule |date=25 May 2006 |dead-url=no |archive-date=8 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208182915/http://www.the-scientist.com/news/display/23494/ |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MicroRNAs===
[[MicroRNA]]s (miRNAs) are members of [[non-coding RNA]]s that range in size from 17 to 25 nucleotides. miRNAs regulate a large variety of biological functions in plants and animals.&lt;ref name=Wang&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Bernal JE, Duran C, Papiha SS | title=Transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of human microRNAs | journal=Cancer Lett | volume=331 | issue=1 | pages=1–10 | year=2012 | pmid=23246373 | doi=10.1016/j.canlet.2012.12.006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, in 2013, about 2000 miRNAs have been discovered in humans and these can be found online in a miRNA database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirbase.org/cgi-bin/browse.pl Browse miRBase by species&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Each miRNA expressed in a cell may target about 100 to 200 messenger RNAs that it downregulates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lim LP, Lau NC, Garrett-Engele P, Grimson A, Schelter JM, Castle J, Bartel DP, Linsley PS, Johnson JM | title=Microarray analysis shows that some microRNAs downregulate large numbers of target mRNAs | journal=Nature | volume=433 | issue=7027 | pages=769–73 | year=2005 | pmid=15685193 | doi=10.1038/nature03315 |bibcode = 2005Natur.433..769L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the downregulation of mRNAs occurs by causing the decay of the targeted mRNA, while some downregulation occurs at the level of translation into protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lee D, Shin C | year = 2012 | title = MicroRNA-target interactions: new insights from genome-wide approaches | journal = Ann N Y Acad Sci | volume = 1271 | issue = | pages = 118–28 | doi = 10.1111/j.1749-6632.2012.06745.x | pmid = 23050973 | pmc=3499661| bibcode = 2012NYASA1271..118L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It appears that about 60% of human protein coding genes are regulated by miRNAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Friedman RC, Farh KK, Burge CB, Bartel DP | title=Most mammalian mRNAs are conserved targets of microRNAs | journal=Genome Res | volume=19 | issue=1 | pages=92–105 | year=2009 | pmid=18955434 | pmc=2612969 | doi=10.1101/gr.082701.108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many miRNAs are epigenetically regulated. About 50% of miRNA genes are associated with [[CpG island]]s,&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt; that may be repressed by epigenetic methylation. Transcription from methylated CpG islands is strongly and heritably repressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Goll MG, Bestor TH | title=Eukaryotic cytosine methyltransferases | journal=Annu Rev Biochem | volume=74 | issue= | pages=481–514 | year=2005 | pmid=15952895 | doi=10.1146/annurev.biochem.74.010904.153721 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other miRNAs are epigenetically regulated by either histone modifications or by combined DNA methylation and histone modification.&lt;ref name=Wang /&gt;

===mRNA===
In 2011, it was demonstrated that the [[methylation]] of [[messenger RNA|mRNA]] plays a critical role in human [[energy balance (biology)|energy homeostasis]]. The obesity-associated [[FTO gene]] is shown to be able to [[demethylate]] [[N6-methyladenosine]] in RNA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Guifang Jia |author2=Ye Fu |author3=Xu Zhao |author4=Qing Dai |author5=Guanqun Zheng |author6=Ying Yang |author7=Chengqi Yi |last8=Lindahl |first8=Tomas |author9=Tao Pan |author10=Yun-Gui Yang |author11=Chuan He |title=N6-Methyladenosine in nuclear RNA is a major substrate of the obesity-associated FTO|journal=[[Nature Chemical Biology]]|date=16 October 2011|volume=7|issue=12|pages=885–87|doi=10.1038/nchembio.687|pmid=22002720|pmc=3218240}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-10-links-common-rna-modification-obesity.html |title=New research links common RNA modification to obesity |publisher=Physorg.com |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===sRNAs===
[[Bacterial small RNA|sRNAs]] are small (50–250 nucleotides), highly structured, non-coding RNA fragments found in bacteria. They control gene expression including [[virulence]] genes in pathogens and are viewed as new targets in the fight against drug-resistant bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Howden BP, Beaume M, Harrison PF, Hernandez D, Schrenzel J, Seemann T, Francois P, Stinear TP | title=Analysis of the Small RNA Transcriptional Response in Multidrug-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus after Antimicrobial Exposure | journal=Antimicrob.

Their phylogenetic analyses, for example through sRNA–mRNA target interactions or protein [[Hfq binding sRNA|binding properties]], are used to build comprehensive databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccb.bmi.ac.cn/srnatarbase/ sRNATarBase 2.0 A comprehensive database of bacterial SRNA targets verified by experiments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130926215123/http://ccb.bmi.ac.cn/srnatarbase/ |date=26 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; sRNA-[[gene map]]s based on their targets in microbial genomes are also constructed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://srnamap.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/ Genomics maps for small non-coding RNA's and their targets in microbial genomes]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prions===
{{details|Fungal prions}}
[[Prion]]s are [[Infection|infectious]] forms of [[protein]]s. In general, proteins fold into discrete units that perform distinct cellular functions, but some proteins are also capable of forming an infectious conformational state known as a prion. Although often viewed in the context of [[Transmissible spongiform encephalopathy|infectious disease]], prions are more loosely defined by their ability to catalytically convert other native state versions of the same protein to an infectious conformational state. It is in this latter sense that they can be viewed as epigenetic agents capable of inducing a phenotypic change without a modification of the genome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Epigenetic inheritance and prions|vauthors=Yool A, Edmunds WJ | journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology | year=1998 | pages=241–42 | volume=11 | doi=10.1007/s000360050085 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fungal prion]]s are considered by some to be epigenetic because the infectious phenotype caused by the prion can be inherited without modification of the genome. [[PSI (prion)|PSI+]] and URE3, discovered in [[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|yeast]] in 1965 and 1971, are the two best studied of this type of prion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=[PSI], a cytoplasmic suppressor of super-suppression in yeast | author=Cox BS| journal=Heredity | volume=20 | pages=505–21 | year=1965 | doi=10.1038/hdy.1965.65 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid5573734"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Lacroute F | title=Non-Mendelian mutation allowing ureidosuccinic acid uptake in yeast | journal=J. Bacteriol. | volume=106 | issue=2 | pages=519–22 | date=May 1971 | pmid=5573734 | pmc=285125 | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prions can have a phenotypic effect through the sequestration of protein in aggregates, thereby reducing that protein's activity. In PSI+ cells, the loss of the Sup35 protein (which is involved in termination of translation) causes ribosomes to have a higher rate of read-through of stop [[codon]]s, an effect that results in suppression of [[nonsense mutation]]s in other genes.&lt;ref name="pmid225301"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Liebman SW, Sherman F | title=Extrachromosomal psi+ determinant suppresses nonsense mutations in yeast | journal=J. Bacteriol. | volume=139 | issue=3 | pages=1068–71 | date=September 1979 | pmid=225301 | pmc=218059 | doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability of Sup35 to form prions may be a conserved trait.

===Structural inheritance===
{{details|Structural inheritance}}
In [[ciliate]]s such as ''[[Tetrahymena]]'' and ''[[Paramecium]]'', genetically identical cells show heritable differences in the patterns of ciliary rows on their cell surface. Experimentally altered patterns can be transmitted to daughter cells. It seems existing structures act as templates for new structures. The mechanisms of such inheritance are unclear, but reasons exist to assume that multicellular organisms also use existing cell structures to assemble new ones.&lt;ref name="pmid1804215"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Sapp J | title=Concepts of organization. The leverage of ciliate protozoa | journal=Dev. Biol. | volume=7 | issue= | pages=229–58 | year=1991 | pmid=1804215 | doi=10.1007/978-1-4615-6823-0_11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-515619-6"&gt;{{cite book | author=Sapp J | title=Genesis: the evolution of biology | publisher=Oxford University Press | location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year=2003 | pages=| isbn=0-19-515619-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-262-65063-0"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Gray RD, Oyama S, Griffiths PE | title=Cycles of Contingency: Developmental Systems and Evolution (Life and Mind: Philosophical Issues in Biology and Psychology) | publisher=The MIT Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts | year=2003 | pages=| isbn=0-262-65063-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nucleosome positioning===
Eukaryotic genomes have numerous [[nucleosomes]]. Nucleosome position is not random, and determine the accessibility of DNA to regulatory proteins. This determines differences in gene expression and cell differentiation. It has been shown that at least some nucleosomes are retained in sperm cells (where most but not all histones are replaced by [[protamines]]). Thus nucleosome positioning is to some degree inheritable. Recent studies have uncovered connections between nucleosome positioning and other epigenetic factors, such as DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation.&lt;ref name=Teif_2014&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Teif VB, Beshnova DA, Vainshtein Y, Marth C, Mallm JP, Höfer T, Rippe K | title=Nucleosome repositioning links DNA (de)methylation and differential CTCF binding during stem cell development | journal=Genome Research |date=8 May 2014 | volume=24 | pages=1285–95 | doi=10.1101/gr.164418.113 | pmid=24812327 | pmc=4120082}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Functions and consequences==

===Development===
Developmental epigenetics can be divided into predetermined and probabilistic epigenesis. Predetermined epigenesis is a unidirectional movement from structural development in DNA to the functional maturation of the protein. "Predetermined" here means that development is scripted and predictable. Probabilistic epigenesis on the other hand is a bidirectional structure-function development with experiences and external molding development.&lt;ref name=Griesemer_2005&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Griesemer J, Haber MH, Yamashita G, Gannett L | title=Critical Notice: Cycles of Contingency – Developmental Systems and Evolution | journal=Biology &amp; Philosophy |date=March 2005 | volume=20 | issue =2–3 | pages=517–44 | doi=10.1007/s10539-004-0836-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somatic epigenetic inheritance, particularly through DNA and histone covalent modifications and [[nucleosome]] repositioning, is very important in the development of multicellular eukaryotic organisms.&lt;ref name="Teif_2014"/&gt; The genome sequence is static (with some notable exceptions), but cells differentiate into many different types, which perform different functions, and respond differently to the environment and intercellular signalling. Thus, as individuals develop, [[morphogen]]s activate or silence genes in an epigenetically heritable fashion, giving cells a memory. In mammals, most cells terminally differentiate, with only [[stem cells]] retaining the ability to differentiate into several cell types ("totipotency" and "multipotency"). In [[mammal]]s, some stem cells continue producing new differentiated cells throughout life, such as in [[Epigenetic Regulation of Neurogenesis|neurogenesis]], but mammals are not able to respond to loss of some tissues, for example, the inability to regenerate limbs, which some other animals are capable of. Epigenetic modifications regulate the transition from neural stem cells to glial progenitor cells (for example, differentiation into oligodendrocytes is regulated by the deacetylation and methylation of histones.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter: "Nervous System Development" in "Epigenetics," by Benedikt Hallgrimsson and Brian Hall&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike animals, plant cells do not terminally differentiate, remaining totipotent with the ability to give rise to a new individual plant. While plants do utilise many of the same epigenetic mechanisms as animals, such as [[chromatin remodeling]], it has been hypothesised that some kinds of plant cells do not use or require "cellular memories", resetting their gene expression patterns using positional information from the environment and surrounding cells to determine their fate.&lt;ref name="pmid17194589"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Costa S, Shaw P | title='Open minded' cells: how cells can change fate | journal=Trends Cell Biol. | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=101–06 | date=March 2007 | pmid=17194589 | doi=10.1016/j.tcb.2006.12.005 | url=http://cromatina.icb.ufmg.br/biomol/seminarios/outros/grupo_open.pdf | quote=This might suggest that plant cells do not use or require a cellular memory mechanism and just respond to positional information.

Epigenetic changes can occur in response to environmental exposure – for example, mice given some dietary supplements have epigenetic changes affecting expression of the [[agouti gene]], which affects their fur color, weight, and propensity to develop cancer.&lt;ref name="pmid12163699"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Cooney CA, Dave AA, Wolff GL | title=Maternal methyl supplements in mice affect epigenetic variation and DNA methylation of offspring | journal=J.

Controversial results from one study suggested that traumatic experiences might produce an epigenetic signal that is capable of being passed to future generations. Mice were trained, using foot shocks, to fear a cherry blossom odor. The investigators reported that the mouse offspring had an increased aversion to this specific odor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fearful-memories-passed-down&amp;print=true Fearful Memories Passed Down to Mouse Descendants: Genetic imprint from traumatic experiences carries through at least two generations], By Ewen Callaway and Nature magazine | Sunday, 1 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://medicalxpress.com/news/2013-12-mice-sons-grandsons-dangers-sperm.html#ajTabs Mice can 'warn' sons, grandsons of dangers via sperm], by Mariette Le Roux, 12/1/13.&lt;/ref&gt; They suggested epigenetic changes that increase gene expression, rather than in DNA itself, in a gene, M71, that governs the functioning of an odor receptor in the nose that responds specifically to this cherry blossom smell. There were physical changes that correlated with olfactory (smell) function in the brains of the trained mice and their descendants. Several criticisms were reported, including the study's low statistical power as evidence of some irregularity such as bias in reporting results.&lt;ref&gt;G. Francis, "Too Much Success for Recent Groundbreaking Epigenetic Experiments" http://www.genetics.org/content/198/2/449.abstract&lt;/ref&gt; Due to limits of sample size, there is a probability that an effect will not be demonstrated to within statistical significance even if it exists. The criticism suggested that the probability that all the experiments reported would show positive results if an identical protocol was followed, assuming the claimed effects exist, is merely 0.4%. The authors also did not indicate which mice were siblings, and treated all of the mice as statistically independent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=24292232 | doi=10.1038/nn.3594 | volume=17 | title=Parental olfactory experience influences behavior and neural structure in subsequent generations | pmc=3923835 | year=2014 | journal=Nat. Neurosci. | pages=89–96 | vauthors=Dias BG, Ressler KJ}} (see comment by Gonzalo Otazu)&lt;/ref&gt; The original researchers pointed out negative results in the paper's appendix that the criticism omitted in its calculations, and undertook to track which mice were siblings in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/41239/title/Epigenetics-Paper-Raises-Questions/{{full citation needed|date=November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgenerational===
{{main|Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance}}
&lt;!--Note that the first sentence of this section clashes with the first sentence of the article defining 'epigenetics', by which epigenetics is necessarily heritable. This may arise from confusing the molecular marks sometimes associated with epigenetic variation (e.g. DNA methylation) with epigenetic phenotypic variation itself.--&gt;
Epigenetic mechanisms were a necessary part of the evolutionary origin of [[cell differentiation]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-19-854968-7"&gt;{{cite book | author = Hoekstra RF | title = Evolution: an introduction | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford [Oxfordshire] | year = 2000 | page = 285 | isbn = 0-19-854968-7  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although epigenetics in multicellular organisms is generally thought to be a mechanism involved in differentiation, with epigenetic patterns "reset" when organisms reproduce, there have been some observations of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance (e.g., the phenomenon of [[paramutation]] observed in [[maize]]). Although most of these multigenerational epigenetic traits are gradually lost over several generations, the possibility remains that multigenerational epigenetics could be another aspect to evolution and adaptation.
As mentioned above, some define epigenetics as heritable.

The filamentous fungus ''Neurospora crassa'' is a prominent model system for understanding the control and function of cytosine methylation.

The [[yeast]] [[prion]] PSI is generated by a conformational change of a translation termination factor, which is then inherited by daughter cells. This can provide a survival advantage under adverse conditions. This is an example of epigenetic regulation enabling unicellular organisms to respond rapidly to environmental stress.

== Epigenetics in bacteria ==
[[File:Escherichia coli flagella TEM.png|thumb|150px|''Escherichia coli'' bacteria]]
While epigenetics is of fundamental importance in [[eukaryote]]s, especially [[Multicellular organism|metazoans]], it plays a different role in bacteria. Most importantly, eukaryotes use epigenetic mechanisms primarily to regulate gene expression which bacteria rarely do. However, bacteria make widespread use of postreplicative DNA methylation for the epigenetic control of DNA-protein interactions. Bacteria also use DNA [[adenine]] methylation (rather than DNA [[cytosine]] methylation) as an epigenetic signal. DNA adenine methylation is important in bacteria virulence in organisms such as ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', ''[[Salmonella]], [[Vibrio]], [[Yersinia]], [[Haemophilus]]'', and ''[[Brucella]]''. In ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', methylation of adenine regulates the cell cycle and couples gene transcription to DNA replication. In ''[[Gammaproteobacteria]]'', adenine methylation provides signals for DNA replication, chromosome segregation, mismatch repair, packaging of bacteriophage, transposase activity and regulation of gene expression.&lt;ref name="JorgTost" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Casadesus"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Casadesús J, Low D | title=Epigenetic gene regulation in the bacterial world | journal=Microbiol.

===Twins===
Direct comparisons of identical twins constitute an optimal model for interrogating environmental epigenetics. In the case of humans with different environmental exposures, monozygotic (identical) twins were epigenetically indistinguishable during their early years, while older twins had remarkable differences in the overall content and genomic distribution of 5-methylcytosine DNA and histone acetylation.&lt;ref name="Moore_2015"/&gt; The twin pairs who had spent less of their lifetime together and/or had greater differences in their medical histories were those who showed the largest differences in their levels of 5-methylcytosine DNA and acetylation of histones H3 and H4.&lt;ref name="pmid16009939" /&gt;

Environmental differences can produce long-term epigenetic effects, and different developmental monozygotic twin subtypes may be different with respect to their susceptibility to be discordant from an epigenetic point of view.&lt;ref name="pmid19653134"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Ballestar E | title=Epigenetics lessons from twins: prospects for autoimmune disease | journal=Clin Rev Allergy Immunol | volume=39 | issue=1 | pages=30–41 | year=2010 | pmid=19653134 | doi=10.1007/s12016-009-8168-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A high-throughput study, which denotes technology that looks at extensive genetic markers, focused on epigenetic differences between monozygotic twins to compare global and locus-specific changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications in a sample of 40 monozygotic twin pairs.&lt;ref name="pmid16009939" /&gt; In this case, only healthy twin pairs were studied, but a wide range of ages was represented, between 3 and 74 years. One of the major conclusions from this study was that there is an age-dependent accumulation of epigenetic differences between the two siblings of twin pairs. This accumulation suggests the existence of epigenetic “drift”. Epigenetic drift is the term given to epigenetic modifications as they occur as a direct function with age. While age is a known risk factor for many diseases, age-related methylation
has been found to occur differentially at specific sites along the genome. Over time, this  can result in measurable differences between biological and chronological age. Epigenetic changes have been found to be reflective of lifestyle and may act as functional biomarkers of disease before clinical threshold is reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wallace |first1=Robert G. |last2=Twomey |first2=Laura C. |last3=Custaud |first3=Marc-Antoine |last4=Moyna |first4=Niall |last5=Cummins |first5=Philip M. |last6=Mangone |first6=Marco |last7=Murphy |first7=Ronan P. |title=Potential Diagnostic and Prognostic Biomarkers of Epigenetic Drift within the Cardiovascular Compartment |journal=BioMed Research International |volume=2016 |issue= |pages=2465763 |year=2016 |pmid=26942189 |pmc=4749768 |doi=10.1155/2016/2465763 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A more recent study, where 114 monozygotic twins and 80 dizygotic twins were analyzed for the DNA methylation status of around 6000 unique genomic regions, concluded that epigenetic similarity at the time of blastocyst splitting may also contribute to phenotypic similarities in monozygotic co-twins. This supports the notion that microenvironment at early stages of embryonic development can be quite important for the establishment of epigenetic marks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Kaminsky ZA, Tang T, Wang SC, Ptak C, Oh GH, Wong AH, Feldcamp LA, Virtanen C, Halfvarson J, Tysk C, McRae AF, Visscher PM, Montgomery GW, Gottesman II, Martin NG, Petronis A | title=DNA methylation profiles in monozygotic and dizygotic twins | journal=Nat Genet | volume=41 | issue=2 | pages=240–45 | year=2009 | pmid=19151718 | doi=10.1038/ng.286 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Congenital genetic disease is well understood and it is clear that epigenetics can play a role, for example, in the case of [[Angelman syndrome]] and [[Prader-Willi syndrome]]. These are normal genetic diseases caused by gene deletions or inactivation of the genes, but are unusually common because individuals are essentially [[hemizygous]] because of [[genomic imprinting]], and therefore a single gene knock out is sufficient to cause the disease, where most cases would require both copies to be knocked out.&lt;ref&gt;{{OMIM|105830}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genomic imprinting===
{{further|Genomic imprinting}}

Some human disorders are associated with [[genomic imprinting]], a phenomenon in mammals where the father and mother contribute different epigenetic patterns for specific genomic loci in their [[germ cells]].&lt;ref name="pmid17121465"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Wood AJ, Oakey RJ | title=Genomic imprinting in mammals: emerging themes and established theories | journal=PLoS Genet. | volume=2 | issue=11 | pages=e147 | date=November 2006 | pmid=17121465 | pmc=1657038 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The best-known case of imprinting in human disorders is that of [[Angelman syndrome]] and [[Prader-Willi syndrome]] – both can be produced by the same genetic mutation, [[chromosome 15q partial deletion]], and the particular syndrome that will develop depends on whether the mutation is inherited from the child's mother or from their father.&lt;ref name="pmid2564739"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Knoll JH, Nicholls RD, Magenis RE, Graham JM, Lalande M, Latt SA | title=Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes share a common chromosome 15 deletion but differ in parental origin of the deletion | journal=Am.

[[Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome]] is also associated with genomic imprinting, often caused by abnormalities in maternal genomic imprinting of a region on chromosome 11.

[[Rett syndrome]] is underlain by mutations in the [[MECP2]] gene despite no large-scale changes in expression of MeCP2 being found in microarray analyses. [[BDNF]] is downregulated in the MECP2 mutant resulting in Rett syndrome.

Epigenetic modifications have given insight into the understanding of the pathophysiology of different disease conditions. Though, they are strongly associated with cancer, their role in other pathological conditions are of equal importance. It appears that, the hyperglycaemic environment could imprint such changes at the genomic level, that macrophages are primed towards a pro-inflammatory
state and could fail to exhibit any phenotypic alteration towards the pro-healing type. This phenomenon of altered Macrophage Polarization is mostly associated with all the diabetic complications in a clinical set-up. At present, several reports reveal the relevance of different epigenetic modifications with respect to diabetic complications. Sooner or later, with the advancements in biomedical
tools, the detection of such biomarkers as prognostic and diagnostic tools in patients could possibly emerge out as alternative approaches. It is noteworthy to mention here that the use of epigenetic modifications as therapeutic targets warrant extensive preclinical as well as clinical evaluation prior to use.&lt;ref&gt;Mallik SB, Jayashree BS, Shenoy RR.

===Early life stress===
In a groundbreaking 2003 report, Caspi and colleagues demonstrated that in a robust cohort of over one-thousand subjects assessed multiple times from preschool to adulthood, subjects who carried one or two copies of the short allele of the serotonin transporter promoter polymorphism exhibited higher rates of adult depression and suicidality when exposed to childhood maltreatment when compared to long allele homozygotes with equal ELS exposure.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caspi|first1=A.|title=Influence of Life Stress on Depression: Moderation by a Polymorphism in the 5-HTT Gene|journal=Science|date=18 July 2003|volume=301|issue=5631|pages=386–89|doi=10.1126/science.1083968|pmid=12869766|bibcode=2003Sci...301..386C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental nutrition, in utero exposure to stress, male-induced maternal effects such as attraction of differential mate quality, and maternal as well as paternal age, and offspring gender could all possibly influence whether a germline epimutation is ultimately expressed in offspring and the degree to which intergenerational inheritance remains stable throughout posterity.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{Cite book |doi=10.1016/B978-0-12-809324-5.02862-5 |isbn=978-0-12-809324-5 | title=Persistence of Early-Life Stress on the Epigenome: Nonhuman Primate Observations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Addiction===
[[Addiction]] is a disorder of the brain's [[reward system]] which arises through [[transcriptional]] and neuroepigenetic mechanisms and occurs over time from chronically high levels of exposure to an addictive stimulus (e.g., morphine, cocaine, sexual intercourse, gambling, etc.).&lt;ref name="Nestler"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robison AJ, Nestler EJ | title = Transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction | journal = Nat.

The formation of ΔFosB in multiple brain regions, and the molecular pathway leading to the formation of AP-1 complexes is well understood. The establishment of a functional purpose for ΔFosB has allowed further determination as to some of the key aspects of its molecular cascades, involving effectors such as GluR2 (87,88), Cdk5 (93) and NFkB (100). Moreover, many of these molecular changes identified are now directly linked to the structural, physiological and behavioral changes observed following chronic drug exposure (60,95,97,102). New frontiers of research investigating the molecular roles of ΔFosB have been opened by epigenetic studies, and recent advances have illustrated the role of ΔFosB acting on DNA and histones, truly as a ‘‘molecular switch’’ (34). As a consequence of our improved understanding of ΔFosB in addiction, it is possible to evaluate the addictive potential of current medications (119), as well as use it as a biomarker for assessing the efficacy of therapeutic interventions (121,122,124). Some of these proposed interventions have limitations (125) or are in their infancy (75). However, it is hoped that some of these preliminary findings may lead to innovative treatments, which are much needed in addiction.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G9a reverses ΔFosB plasticity"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Biliński P, Wojtyła A, Kapka-Skrzypczak L, Chwedorowicz R, Cyranka M, Studziński T | title = Epigenetic regulation in drug addiction | journal = Ann.

In this way, the induction of CDK5 gene expression occurs together with suppression of the G9A gene coding for dimethyltransferase acting on the histone H3. A feedback mechanism can be observed in the regulation of these 2 crucial factors that determine the adaptive epigenetic response to cocaine. This depends on ΔFosB inhibiting G9a gene expression, i.e. H3K9me2 synthesis which in turn inhibits transcription factors for ΔFosB.

=== Depression ===
Epigenetic inheritance of depression-related phenotypes has also been reported in a preclinical study.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Inheritance of paternal stress-induced traits across generations involved small non-coding RNA signals transmitted via the paternal germline.

=== Fear conditioning ===
Studies on mice have shown that certain conditional fears can be inherited from either parent. In one example, mice were conditioned to fear a strong scent, [[acetophenone]], by accompanying the smell with an electric shock. Consequently, the mice learned to fear the scent of acetophenone alone. It was discovered that this fear could be passed down to the mice offspring. Despite the offspring never experiencing the electric shock themselves the mice still displayed a fear of the acetophenone scent, because they inherited the fear epigenetically by site-specific DNA methylation. These epigenetic changes lasted up to two generations without reintroducing the shock.&lt;ref name="Szyf2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Szyf M |title=Lamarck revisited: epigenetic inheritance of ancestral odor fear conditioning |journal=Nat. Neurosci. |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=2–4 |year=2014 |pmid=24369368 |doi=10.1038/nn.3603 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
The two forms of heritable information, namely genetic and epigenetic, are collectively denoted as dual inheritance. Members of the APOBEC/AID family of [[cytosine deaminase]]s may concurrently influence genetic and epigenetic inheritance using similar molecular mechanisms, and may be a point of crosstalk between these conceptually compartmentalized processes.&lt;ref name="pmid20800313"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Chahwan R, Wontakal SN, Roa S | title=Crosstalk between genetic and epigenetic information through cytosine deamination | journal=Trends Genet. | volume=26 | issue=10 | pages=443–48 | date=October 2010 | pmid=20800313 | doi=10.1016/j.tig.2010.07.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fluoroquinolone]] antibiotics induce epigenetic changes in [[mammalian]] cells through iron [[chelation]]. This leads to epigenetic effects through inhibition of α-ketoglutarate-dependent [[dioxygenases]] that require [[iron]] as a co-factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=26205818 | doi=10.1074/jbc.M115.671222 | volume=290 | title=Nonantibiotic Effects of Fluoroquinolones in Mammalian Cells. | date=Sep 2015 | journal=J Biol Chem | pages=22287–97 | pmc=4571980 | author=Badal S, Her YF, Maher LJ 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various pharmacological agents are applied for the production of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) or maintain the embryonic stem cell (ESC) phenotypic via epigenetic approach. Adult stem cells like bone marrow stem cells have also shown a potential to differentiate into cardiac competent cells when treated with G9a histone methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=mezentseva|first1=nadejda|last2=yang|first2=jinpu|last3=kaur|first3=keerat|last4=eisenberg|first4=carol|last5=eisenberg|first5=leonard|title=The histone methyltransferase inhibitor BIX01294 enhances the cardiac potential of bone marrow cells.|date=2012|pmid=22994322|doi=10.1089/scd.2012.0181|volume=22|journal=Stem Cells Dev|pages=654–67|pmc=3564468}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=yang|first1=jinpu|last2=kaur|first2=keerat|last3=ong|first3=lilin|last4=eisenberg|first4=carol|last5=eisenberg|first5=leonard|title=Inhibition of G9a Histone Methyltransferase Converts Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cells to Cardiac Competent Progenitors.|journal=Stem Cells International|date=2015|pmid=26089912|doi=10.1155/2015/270428|volume=2015|pages=270428|pmc=4454756}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pseudoscience==
Due to epigenetics being in the early stages of development as a science and the [[sensationalism]] surrounding it in the public media, [[David Gorski]] and geneticist [[Adam Rutherford]] advised caution against proliferation of false and [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] conclusions by [[new age]] authors who make unfounded suggestions that a person's genes and health can be manipulated by [[brainwashing|mind control]]. Misuse of the scientific term by [[quackery|quack authors]] has produced misinformation to the general public.&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/jul/19/epigenetics-dna--darwin-adam-rutherford "Beware the pseudo gene genies"].

'''''Far-fetched facts''''' is a book by German [[anthropologist]] [[Richard Rottenburg]] published in German as ''Weit hergeholte Fakten'' in 2002; the English translation was released in 2009. The book is an [[ethnography|ethnography-based]], though fictionalized, [[polyphonic]] account of a waterworks improvement project in Tanzania (called Ruritania in the books fictionalization). The book follows the different stages of the development project by looking closely at the interactions between a Northern development bank, experts of an international consulting firm and African project managers. It focuses thereby on technologies of inscription that enable the reconnaissance and [[operationalization]] of improvement measures to be taken, but also guide the overall interaction between the different stakeholders of the project. Showing these representational and managerial practices the book lays bare the necessary day-to-day production of objectivity and legitimacy in development projects, but also the intricacies and inconsistencies of daily translation processes, that often lead to the rather disappointing results of such development enterprises. Inspired by [[Organizational studies|organizational]] and [[science and technology studies]] “Far-fetched facts” provides an anthropological critique of the aid industry in Africa distinct from [[Postdevelopment theory|postdevelopment critique]].

If the authors had formally assigned strain GFAJ-1 to the genus ''Halomonas'',&lt;ref name = "Thriving"/&gt; the name would be given as ''Halomonas'' sp. GFAJ-1.

==Biochemistry==
A phosphorus-free [[growth medium]] (which actually contained 3.1 ± 0.3&amp;nbsp;μM of residual phosphate, from impurities in reagents) was used to culture the bacteria in a regime of increasing exposure to [[arsenate]]; the initial level of 0.1&amp;nbsp;mM was eventually ramped up to 40&amp;nbsp;mM. Alternative media used for comparative experiments contained either high levels of [[phosphate]] (1.5&amp;nbsp;mM) with no arsenate, or had neither added phosphate nor added arsenate.  It was observed that GFAJ-1 could grow through many doublings in cell numbers when cultured in either phosphate or arsenate media, but could not grow when placed in a medium of a similar composition to which neither phosphate nor arsenate was added.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; The phosphorus content of the arsenic-fed, phosphorus-starved bacteria (as measured by [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|ICP-MS)]] was only 0.019 (± 0.001) % by dry weight, one thirtieth of that when grown in phosphate-rich medium. This phosphorus content was also only about one tenth of the cells' average arsenic content (0.19 ± 0.25% by dry weight).&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; The arsenic content of cells as measured by ICP-MS varies widely and can be lower than the phosphorus contents in some experiments, and up to fourteen times higher in others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/bcst/miscellaneous/WolfeSimon.pdf | title = Geobiochemistry: Microbes and the four basic strategies for Life on Earth | author =  Felisa Wolfe-Simon }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other data from the same study obtained with nano-[[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]] suggest a ~75-fold excess of phosphate (P) over arsenic (As) when expressed as P:C and As:C ratios, even in cells grown with arsenate and no added phosphate.&lt;ref name=SupportingMaterial/&gt; When cultured in the arsenate solution, GFAJ-1 only grew 60% as fast as it did in phosphate solution.&lt;ref name=Alla/&gt; The phosphate-starved bacteria had an intracellular volume 1.5&amp;nbsp;times normal; the greater volume appeared to be associated with the appearance of large "[[vacuole]]-like regions".&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt;
[[File:GFAJ-1 (grown on phosphorus).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] of GFAJ-1 cells grown in defined minimal medium supplemented with 1.5&amp;nbsp;mM phosphate]]
When the researchers added [[Isotopic labeling|isotope-labeled]] arsenate to the solution to [[pulse-chase analysis|track its distribution]], they found that arsenic was present in the cellular fractions containing the bacteria's [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and metabolites such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], as well as its [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].&lt;ref name=Alla/&gt; Nucleic acids from [[Bacterial growth|stationary phase]] cells starved of phosphorus were concentrated via five [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]]s (one with [[phenol]], three with [[phenol-chloroform extraction|phenol-chloroform]] and one with [[chloroform]] extraction solvent), followed by [[Ethanol precipitation#DNA Precipitation|ethanol precipitation]]. Although direct evidence of the incorporation of arsenic into biomolecules is still lacking, [[Radioactivity in the life sciences|radioactivity]] measurements suggested that approximately one-tenth (11.0 ± 0.1%) of the arsenic absorbed by these bacteria ended up in the fraction that contained the [[nucleic acids]] (DNA and RNA) and all other co-precipitated compounds not extracted by the previous treatments.&lt;ref name="Science"/&gt; A comparable control experiment with isotope-labeled phosphate was not performed.
With the distribution of the strain in mid-2011, other labs began to independently test the validity of the discovery. [[Rosemary Redfield]] from the [[University of British Columbia]], following issues with the growth conditions, investigated the growth requirements of GFAJ-1, and found that the strain grows better on solid [[agar]] medium than in liquid culture. Redfield attributed this to low potassium levels and hypothesized that the potassium levels in basal ML60 medium may be too low to support growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rrresearch.blogspot.com/2011/07/two-mistakes-discovered.html|title=RRResearch: Two mistakes discovered |author=Rosie Redfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redfield after finding and addressing further issues (ionic strength, pH and the use of glass tubes instead of polypropylene) found that arsenate marginally stimulated growth, but didn't affect the final densities of the cultures, unlike what was claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/2011_11_01_archive.html|title=RRResearch: Growth of GFAJ-1 in arsenate |author=Rosie Redfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent studies using mass spectrometry by the same group found no evidence of arsenate being incorporated into the DNA of GFAJ-1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://rrresearch.fieldofscience.com/2012/01/csclmass-spectrometry-data.html | title =  The CsCl/mass spectrometry data | author = Rosie Redfield | date = January 16, 2012 | publisher = rrresearch.fieldofscience.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chemist [[Steven A. Benner]] has expressed doubts that [[arsenate]] has replaced phosphate in the DNA of this organism. He suggested that the [[trace element|trace contaminants]] in the growth medium used by Wolfe-Simon in her laboratory cultures are sufficient to supply the phosphorus needed for the cells' DNA. He believes that it is more likely that arsenic is being sequestered elsewhere in the cells.&lt;ref name=Alla/&gt;&lt;ref name="Thriving"/&gt;  [[University of British Columbia]] [[microbiologist]] Rosemary Redfield said that the paper "doesn't present any convincing evidence that arsenic has been incorporated into DNA or any other biological molecule", and suggests that the experiments lacked the washing steps and [[scientific control|controls]] necessary to properly validate their conclusions.&lt;ref name="Redfield"&gt;{{cite web

A simple explanation for the GFAJ-1 growth in medium supplied with arsenate instead of phosphate was provided by a team of researchers at the [[University of Miami]] in Florida. After labeling the [[ribosomes]] of a laboratory strain of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' with radioactive isotopes, they followed bacterial growth in medium containing arsenate but no phosphate. They found that arsenate induces massive degradation of [[ribosomes]], thus providing sufficient phosphate for the slow growth of arsenate tolerant bacteria. Similarly, they suggest, GFAJ-1 cells grow by recycling phosphate from degraded ribosomes, rather than by replacing it with arsenate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Harris TK and Deutscher MP | last=Basturea GN | title= Growth of a bacterium that apparently uses arsenic instead of phosphorus is a consequence of massive ribosome breakdown | date=17 August 2012 | pmid=22798070 | doi=10.1074/jbc.C112.394403 | volume=287 | issue=34 | journal=J Biol Chem | pages=28816–9 | pmc=3436571}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the publication of the articles challenging the conclusions of the original ''Science'' article first describing GFAJ-1, the website [[Retraction Watch]] argued that the original article should be retracted because of misrepresentation of critical data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://retractionwatch.wordpress.com/2012/07/09/despite-refutation-science-arsenic-life-paper-deserves-retraction-scientist-argues/ | title=Despite refutation, Science arsenic life paper deserves retraction, scientist argues | author = David Sanders | publisher = Retraction Watch | accessdate= 2012-07-09| date=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.periodicplayground.com/blog/bp/2013/02/guest-post-david-sanders-why-its-high-time-to-retract-arseniclife| author = David Sanders| accessdate = 2013-02-16| title = Why it's high time to retract #arseniclife| publisher = periodicplayground| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131029210723/http://www.periodicplayground.com/blog/bp/2013/02/guest-post-david-sanders-why-its-high-time-to-retract-arseniclife| archivedate = 29 October 2013| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; So far, in January 2018, the paper has not yet been retracted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/332/6034/1163 | doi=10.1126/science.1197258| pmid=21127214| title=A Bacterium That Can Grow by Using Arsenic Instead of Phosphorus| journal=Science| volume=332| issue=6034| pages=1163–1166| year=2011| last1=Wolfe-Simon| first1=F.| last2=Blum| first2=J.

'''Generative design''' is an [[Iteration|iterative]] [[design]] [[Process (engineering)|process]] that involves a [[Computer program|program]] that will [[Generator (mathematics)|generate]] a certain number of [[Output (computing)|outputs]] that meet certain [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]], and a [[designer]] that will fine tune the [[feasible region]] by changing [[Maxima and minima|minimal and maximal]] values of an [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] in which a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] of the program meets the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] of constraints, in order to reduce or augment the number of outputs to [[Choice|choose]] from. The program doesn't need to be run on a [[machine]] like a [[digital computer]], it can be run by a human for example with [[pen and paper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.evaburger.at/portfolio/generative-design-with-analogue-techniques/|title=generative design with analogue techniques – eva designs|website=www.evaburger.at|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The designer doesn't need to be a [[human]], it can be a [[Test (assessment)|test]] program in a testing environment or an [[artificial intelligence]] (see for example [[Generative adversarial network|Generative adversarial networks]]). The designer [[Learning|learns]] to [[Refinement (computing)|refine]] the program (usually involving [[Algorithm|algorithms]]) with each iteration as his design [[Goal|goals]] become better [[Definition|defined]] over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cimdata.com/en/news/item/8402-generative-design-what-s-that|title=“Generative Design” – What’s That? - CIMdata|last=Meintjes|first=Keith|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.autodesk.com/solutions/generative-design|title=What is Generative Design {{!}} Tools &amp; Software {{!}} Autodesk|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/what-generative-design-anthony-hauck|title=What is Generative Design?|date=2018-04-09|access-date=2018-06-15|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://designbyming.com/relational-design-thinking/|title=Relational Design Thinking — Design by Ming|website=designbyming.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The output could be [[Image|images]], [[Sound|sounds]], [[Architectural model|architectural models]], [[animation]], and much more. It is therefore a fast method of exploring design possibilities that is used in various design fields such as [[art]], [[architecture]], [[Communication Design|communication design]], and [[Product Design|product design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.engineering.com/DesignSoftware/DesignSoftwareArticles/ArticleID/16973/Generative-Design-The-Road-to-Production.aspx|title=Generative Design: The Road to Production|last=ENGINEERING.com|website=www.engineering.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process combined with the [[Computing power|power]] of digital computers that can explore a very large number of possible [[Permutation|permutations]] of a solution enables designers to generate and test brand new options, beyond what a human alone could accomplish, to arrive at a most effective and optimized design. It [[Biomimetics|mimics nature]]’s [[evolutionary]] approach to design through [[genetic variation]] and [[Selection (biology)|selection]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autodesk.com/customer-stories/airbus|title=Definition adapted from a product developed by Autodesk named Generative Design|website=Autodesk|accessdate=30 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Generative design is becoming more important, largely due to new programming environments or scripting capabilities that have made it relatively easy, even for designers with little programming experience, to implement their ideas. Additionally, this process can create solutions to substantially complex problems that would otherwise be resource-exhaustive with an alternative approach making it a more attractive option for problems with a large or unknown solution set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1003551283|title=Compositional model-based design: A generative approach to the conceptual design of physical systems|last=Prasanta|first=Rajamoney, Shankar A.

[[File:Geotechnical centrifuge at the University of California, Davis..png|thumb|{{convert|9|m|ft|adj=mid|-radius|0}} geotechnical [[centrifuge]] at the University of California, Davis]]

'''Geotechnical centrifuge modeling''' is a technique for testing physical scale models of [[geotechnical|Geotechnical Engineering]] systems such as natural and man-made slopes and earth retaining structures and building or bridge foundations.

The scale [[Physical model|model]] is typically constructed in the laboratory and then loaded onto the end of the [[centrifuge]], which is typically between {{convert|0.2|and|10|m|ft|1}} in radius. The purpose of spinning the models on the centrifuge is to increase the [[g-force]]s on the model so that stresses in the model are equal to stresses in the prototype.  For example, the stress beneath a {{convert|0.1|m|ft|adj=mid|-deep|1}} layer of model [[Soil mechanics|soil]] spun at a centrifugal acceleration of 50 g produces stresses equivalent to those beneath a {{convert|5|m|ft|adj=mid|-deep|0}} prototype layer of soil in earth's [[gravity]].

The idea to use centrifugal acceleration to simulate increased gravitational acceleration was first proposed by Phillips (1869). Pokrovsky and Fedorov (1936) in the Soviet Union and Bucky (1931) in the United States were the first to implement the idea. [[Andrew N. Schofield]] (e.g. Schofield 1980) played a key role in modern development of centrifuge modeling.

==Principles of centrifuge modeling==

===Typical applications===
[[File:Centrifuge Model of a Port Structure.png|thumb|Model of a port structure loaded on the UC Davis centrifuge]]
A geotechnical centrifuge is used to test models of geotechnical problems such as the strength, stiffness and capacity of foundations for bridges and buildings, settlement of embankments, stability of slopes, earth retaining structures, tunnel stability and seawalls. Other applications include explosive cratering, contaminant migration in ground water, frost heave and sea ice. The centrifuge may be useful for scale modeling of any large-scale nonlinear problem for which gravity is a primary driving force.

===Reason for model testing on the centrifuge===
Geotechnical materials such as soil and rock have non-linear mechanical properties that depend on the effective confining stress and stress history. The centrifuge applies an increased "gravitational" [[acceleration]] to physical models in order to produce identical self-weight stresses in the model and prototype. The one to one scaling of stress enhances the similarity of geotechnical models and makes it possible to obtain accurate data to help solve complex problems such as [[earthquake]]-induced liquefaction, soil-structure interaction and underground transport of pollutants such as dense non-aqueous phase liquids. Centrifuge model testing provides data to improve our understanding of basic mechanisms of deformation and failure and provides benchmarks useful for verification of [[numerical model]]s.

===Scaling laws===
Note that in this article, the asterisk on any quantity represents the scale factor for that quantity. For example, in  &lt;math&gt;x^* = \frac{x_{m}} {x_{p}}&lt;/math&gt;, the subscript m represents "model" and the subscript p represents "prototype" and &lt;math&gt;x^* \,&lt;/math&gt; represents the scale factor for the quantity &lt;math&gt;x \,&lt;/math&gt; (Garnier et al. 2007).

The reason for spinning a model on a centrifuge is to enable small scale models to feel the same effective stresses as a full-scale prototype. This goal can be stated mathematically as

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma'^* = \frac{\sigma'_{m}} {\sigma'_{p}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

where the asterisk represents the scaling factor for the quantity, &lt;math&gt;\sigma'_{m}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective stress in the model and &lt;math&gt;\sigma'_{p}&lt;/math&gt; is the effective stress in the prototype.

In [[soil mechanics]] the vertical effective stress, &lt;math&gt;\sigma'&lt;/math&gt; for example, is typically calculated by

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma' = \sigma^t - u\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\sigma^t &lt;/math&gt; is the total stress and  &lt;big&gt;&lt;math&gt; u &lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the pore pressure. For a uniform layer with no pore pressure, the total vertical stress at a depth &lt;math&gt;H &lt;/math&gt; may be calculated by:

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma^t = \rho g H \,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; represents the density of the layer and &lt;math&gt; g&lt;/math&gt; represents gravity. In the conventional form of centrifuge modeling (Garnier et al. 2007), it is typical that the same materials are used in the model and prototype; therefore the densities are the same in model and prototype, i.e.,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho^* = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore, in conventional centrifuge modeling all lengths are scaled by the same factor &lt;math&gt;L^*&lt;/math&gt;. To produce the same stress in the model as in the prototype, we thus require  &lt;math&gt;\rho^*g^*H^* = (1)g^*L^* = 1 \,&lt;/math&gt;, which may be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;g^* = \frac{1} {L^*}&lt;/math&gt;

The above scaling law states that if lengths in the model are reduced by some factor, n, then gravitational accelerations must be increased by the same factor, n in order to preserve equal stresses in model and prototype.

====Dynamic problems====
For dynamic problems where gravity and accelerations are important, all accelerations must scale as gravity is scaled, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;a^* = g^* = \frac{1} {L^*}&lt;/math&gt;

Since acceleration has units of &lt;math&gt;\frac{L} {T^2}&lt;/math&gt;, it is required that 
:&lt;math&gt;a^* = \frac{L^*} {T^{*2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence it is required that :&lt;math&gt;\frac{1} {L^*} = \frac{L^*} {T^{*2}}&lt;/math&gt;, or

:&lt;math&gt;T^* = L^* \,&lt;/math&gt;

Frequency has units of inverse of time, velocity has units of length per time, so for dynamic problems we also obtain

:&lt;math&gt;f^* = \frac{1} {L{*}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;v^* = \frac{L^*} {T{*}} = 1&lt;/math&gt;

====Diffusion problems====

:&lt;math&gt;T^* = L^{*2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

For model tests involving both dynamics and diffusion, the conflict in time scale factors may be resolved by scaling the permeability of the soil (Garnier et al. 2007)

====Scaling of other quantitites====
(this section obviously needs work!)

scale factors for energy, force, pressure, acceleration, velocity, etc. 
Note that stress has units of pressure, or force per unit area. Thus we can show that

Substituting F = m∙a (Newton's law, [[force]] = mass ∙ acceleration) and r = m/L3 (from the definition of mass density).

Scale factors for many other quantities can be derived from the above relationships. The table below summarizes common scale factors for centrifuge testing.

Scale Factors for Centrifuge Model Tests (from Garnier et al. 2007)
(Table is suggested to be added here)

==Value of centrifuge in geotechnical earthquake engineering==

[[File:Schematic Piles In Centrifuge Model.jpg|thumb|Schematic of a model containing piles in sloping ground. The dimensions are given in prototype scale. For this experiment the scale factor was 30 or 50.]]
[[File:BrandenbergSoilexcavation.jpg|thumb|Excavation of a centrifuge model after liquefaction and lateral spreading.]]

Large earthquakes are infrequent and unrepeatable but they can be devastating. All of these factors make it difficult to obtain the required data to study their effects by post earthquake field investigations. Instrumentation of full scale structures is expensive to maintain over the large periods of time that may elapse between major temblors, and the instrumentation may not be placed in the most scientifically useful locations. Even if engineers are lucky enough to obtain timely recordings of data from real failures, there is no guarantee that the instrumentation is providing repeatable data. In addition, scientifically educational failures from real earthquakes come at the expense of the safety of the public. Understandably, after a real earthquake, most of the interesting data is rapidly cleared away before engineers have an opportunity to adequately study the failure modes.

Centrifuge modeling is a valuable tool for studying the effects of ground shaking on critical structures without risking the safety of the public. The efficacy of alternative designs or seismic retrofitting techniques can compared in a repeatable scientific series of tests.

==Verification of numerical models==

Centrifuge tests can also be used to obtain experimental data to verify a design procedure or a computer model. The rapid development of computational power over recent decades has revolutionized engineering analysis. Many computer models have been developed to predict the behavior of geotechnical structures during earthquakes and other loads. Before a computer model can be used with confidence, it must be proven to be valid based on evidence. The meager and unrepeatable data provided by natural earthquakes, for example, is usually insufficient for this purpose. Verification of the validity of assumptions made by a computational algorithm is especially important in the area of geotechnical engineering due to the complexity of soil behavior. Soils exhibit highly non-linear behavior, their strength and stiffness depend on their stress history and on the water pressure in the pore fluid, all of which may evolve during the loading caused by an earthquake. The computer models which are intended to simulate these phenomena are very complex and require extensive verification. Experimental data from centrifuge tests is useful for verifying assumptions made by a computational algorithm. If the results show the computer model to be inaccurate, the centrifuge test data provides insight into the physical processes which in turn stimulates the development of better computer models.

The '''Grantham Institute - Climate Change and Environment''' (formerly Grantham Institute for Climate Change) is one of five Global Institutes at [[Imperial College London]] and one of three Grantham sponsored centres in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imperial.ac.uk|title=Imperial College London|author=|date=|website=Imperial College London|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute was founded in 2007 with a £12m donation from the Grantham Foundation for the Protection of the Environment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granthamfoundation.org|title=Grantham Foundation|author=|date=|website=Grantham Foundation|accessdate=26 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; an organisation set up by Hannelore and [[Jeremy Grantham]].

The Institute brings together climate and global environmental change expertise from across the College for [[climate change]] related research and translation into real world impact. Their aim is to improve the interaction between researchers and decision makers in business and governments, communicating research to help ensure that choices are based on the best understanding of the science and evidence available.

==Research==
Research at the Institute is focused on four core ‘themes’:  First, Earth systems science, including modelling of climate processes, and  biosphere-atmosphere interactions and feedbacks.  Second, Risks, extremes and irreversible change, including: the likelihood of extreme events in the future, and their potential impact. Third,  Sustainable futures, including   transition to a low-carbon economy,   natural mitigation and  carbon storage in ecosystems, and policy and market frameworks to support a low-carbon economy. Fourth, vulnerable ecosystems and human wellbeing, including the impact of environmental change and climate change on ecosystems,  and sustainable management plans and policy mechanisms to manage impacts.

==Policy implications==
A dedicated Policy Team  delivers research projects, publications, partnerships, and events, aimed at communicating the science behind global environmental change and its impacts. The team publishes Briefing Paper documents disseminating the scientific understanding, possible solutions, and outcomes to government, business and NGOs.

Helmut Winschermann was born in [[Mülheim|Mülheim an der Ruhr]] in 1920.  He became an orchestral oboist with the Municipal Orchestra of [[Oberhausen]] after studying in Essen and Paris.  From 1945 he was principal oboe with the [[hr-Sinfonieorchester|Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra]] including in its period known as the Hessen Radio Symphony Orchestra.&lt;ref name=all&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/artist/helmut-winschermann-mn0000574882/biography AllMusic]; Retrieved 27 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

With the flautist [[Kurt Redel]] and harpsichordist Irmgard Winschermann Lechner, he was a co-founder of the chamber music ensemble Collegium Pro Arte, later called the Collegium Instrumentale Detmold.

In 1956 he was appointed principal chair of the oboe department at the [[Hochschule für Musik Detmold]], having taught there since 1948.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;  His students include [[Hansjörg Schellenberger]], [[Fumiaki Miyamoto]], [[Ingo Goritzki]], Günther Passin and Gernot Schmalfuß.

He recorded the [[Oboe Quartet (Mozart)| Mozart Oboe Quartet in F Major (K.370)]] with the [[Günter Kehr|Kehr]] Trio issued in 1957 on [[Teldec|Telefunken]] LGX 66065 in the UK.

He maintained a touring schedule as a soloist, and frequently collaborated with the [[Cappella Coloniensis]], the Chamber Orchestra of the Saar under [[Karl Ristenpart]], and the [[Stuttgart Chamber Orchestra]] under [[Karl Münchinger]].

Winschermann founded the instrumental ensemble [[Deutsche Bachsolisten]] in 1960, in order to provide [[historically informed performance]]s of the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] and his baroque contemporaries.  He initially divided his time between playing the oboe and conducting the group, but later focussed on conducting solely.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;  Under his direction they have made a multitude of recordings and toured widely internationally.  They are particularly popular in Japan, having visited there at least 14 times.&lt;ref name=all/&gt; 

In 2010 the group celebrated its 50th anniversary in a concert at the [[Beethovenhalle]] in [[Bonn]], with the 90-year-old Winschermann conducting his own orchestration of Bach's ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''.

==Honours==
In 1992 Helmut Winschermann was made an Honorary Member of the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in London.&lt;ref name=all/&gt;

In 2013 he won the [[Georg Philipp Telemann Prize]] of [[Magdeburg]].

He has twice been awarded the [[Edison Prize]].

==Cultural festival==

IISER Mohali's first cultural festival (Conoscenza) was held in 2012. Spread over three days, a Parliamentary Debate and numerous quizzes were the main events. A workshop on 'science writing' was also organised.

The next year, Conoscenza was replaced by a full-fledged cultural festival- Insomnia. Apart from parliamentary debate and quizzing, the availability of a large auditorium enabled the organisation of events related to music, dance and dramatics.

Insomnia is planned to be held every year; Insomnia 2014 was held between 4 and 6 April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insomnia2014.com/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325102931/http://www.insomnia2014.com/ |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insomnia 2015 was held on 27–29 March 2015 and many many cultural, quizzing and gaming contests were the key features of the event and most importantly the theme of Insomnia 2015 was "GO GREEN".
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-insomnia.net/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315161420/http://www.i-insomnia.net/ |date=15 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insomnia 2016 was held from 4–6 March 2016 and saw an attendance of participants and audience from colleges like ISB, IIT's, NIT's, Panjab University, PEC and lot more.&lt;ref&gt;http://insomniacx.in&lt;/ref&gt; Parikrama - The Band performed at the event to a huge crowd.

The past sponsors for INSOMNIA include brands like Hero, Mediacomm, Canara Bank, SBI etc.

Insomnia 2017 was held on 24–26 February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;http://insomniafest.xyz&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guthrie Govan]], Mohini Dey and Gino Banks performed on the night of 24 February 2017.

==National Science Day celebrations==
[[National Science Day]] celebrations on 28 February are a regular feature at IISER Mohali, every year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iisermohali.ac.in/scienceday2014/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140629025012/http://iisermohali.ac.in/scienceday2014/index.html |date=29 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Invitations are sent to schools in  [[Mohali]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Panchkula]] and nearby areas. 
The focus of the day is on science and mathematics demonstrations prepared by IISER Mohali students and faculty members. A large number of schools send teams for inter-school competitions such as science quizzes, group discussions, treasure hunt, junkyard wars, poster presentation held on this day. Other non-competitive events such as documentary screening, anti-superstition demonstrations, atc. are also held. The day usually ends with a 'panel discussion' in which the school students ask science-related questions to a panel of faculty members of IISER Mohali. 
Since 2015, the Science Day celebrations have been shifted to 27 September, IISER Mohali's Foundation Day, as this date is more convenient for school students in the region.

==Opportunity Cell==
The Opportunity Cell was first proposed by the Student Representative Council, in October 2011 as a joint student-faculty
body to provide guidance to students about research and job opportunities. In the year 2012−13, the opportunity cell established a summer
research and internship programme with [[National Centre for Biological Sciences]] (NCBS), Bangalore, Connexios Life sciences &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://connexios.com/ |title=Connexios Life Sciences Pvt. Ltd |website=Connexios.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucid Software Limited (Lucid). It also organised various seminars such as 
"Alternative Careers in Science", "Research Opportunities at [[University of St Andrews]]" etc. Currently the cell disseminates information about
summer research programmes, PhD positions and research oriented jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iisermohali.ac.in/OppCell_f1-master/public/index.php/home |title=Home &amp;#124; Opportunity Cell |website=Iisermohali.ac.in |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==
Two editions of IISER Mohali's magazine ("Manthan") have been published so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iisermmag.wordpress.com/ |title=iisermmag &amp;#124; eManthan: IISER Mohali Online Magazine |website=Iisermmag.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:IHES main building.jpg|thumbnail|IHÉS main building]]

The '''Institut des hautes études scientifiques''' ('''IHÉS'''; English: Institute of Advanced Scientific Studies) is a [[France|French]] institute supporting advanced research in [[mathematics]] and [[theoretical physics]]. It is located in [[Bures-sur-Yvette]] just south of [[Paris]]. It is now part of the federal [[University of Paris-Saclay]] as an advanced studies institute.

==History==
The IHÉS, was founded in 1958 by businessman and mathematical physicist [[Léon Motchane]] with the help of [[Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Jean Dieudonné]] as a research centre in France, modeled on the renowned [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in Princeton, United States.&lt;ref name="50th anniversary"&gt;{{cite web |title=On the occasion of receiving the Seki Takakazu Prize |url=http://mathsoc.jp/publication/tushin/1203/IHES12-3.pdf |publisher=[[Mathematical Society of Japan]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
{{quotation|[[IHÉS]] explicitly draws inspiration from the model of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton (IAS). ... IHÉS adopted its basic characteristics - the intellectual ones - as a high level institute dedicated to basic research - and certain practical ones - such as the tradition of tea being served daily, conducive to exchanges of views. Of equal importance was the relationship between Oppenheimer and Léon Motchane (1900-1990), the founder and first director of IHÉS. As life member of the scientific committee, advisor to the director, frequent visitor and regular correspondent, Oppenheimer played a major role in the crucial early years at IHÉS. ... Oppenheimer and Motchane ... exchanged long letters and short telegrams on all aspects of life at IHÉS. ... Visits by Oppenheimer were cleverly orchestrated by Léon Motchane and reported in the press. Oppenheimer’s presence was an event in itself and his coming to lHÉS gave the Institute important official recognition. Oppenheimer was to come to IHÉS three times: from 16 to 19 September 1959, on 17 and 18 October 1961 (in Bures, although the Institute had not moved there yet), and from 14 to 17 May 1963. His last visit, planned for 1965, was cancelled for health reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ihes.fr/jsp/site/Portal.jsp?document_id=3810&amp;portlet_id=1026 IHES – Oppenheimer and IHÉS (1958-1967)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The strong personality of [[Alexandre Grothendieck]] and the broad sweep of his revolutionizing theories were a dominating feature of the first ten years at the IHÉS.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} [[René Thom]] received an invitation from IHÉS in 1963 and after his appointment remained there until his death in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=edited by Lawrence D. Kritzman, Brian J. Reilly |title=The Columbia History Of Twentieth-Century French Thought |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |page=665}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Dennis Sullivan]] is remembered as one who had a special talent for encouraging fruitful exchanges among visitors and provoking a new and deeper insight into their ideas.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The IHÉS runs a highly regarded mathematical journal, ''[[Publications Mathématiques de l'IHÉS]]''.

The '''Institute for Sales and Account Management (ISAM)''' is a Dutch knowledge institute that was founded in 1996 as part of the [[Erasmus University Rotterdam]]. ISAM conducts research in the field of [[neuroeconomics]]; a science in which [[economics]], [[psychology]], and [[neuroscience]] are combined.

Serving as an example is the research into the brain activity of salespeople, which can be detected through the use of fMRI scans. [[Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (fMRI) is a technique that can trace the location in the brains where someone is processing information at the moment that he or she is faced with a stimulus (e.g. interaction with a client). Thus, with the help of an fMRI scanner both the conscious as well as the unconscious brain processes can be traced. This study has been realized in cooperation with the [[Erasmus MC]] (medical center) and the [[University of Michigan]]. It has been published in the Journal of Marketing Research.

All knowledge that is acquired through ISAM research, is transferred to the (inter)national business world by means of postgraduate education programmes in the field of sales and account management.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The '''International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering''' (ISNSCE, pronounced like "essence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Erik Winfree Homepage|url=http://www.dna.caltech.edu/~winfree/|publisher=Winfree Laboratory, California Institute of Technology|accessdate=9 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[scientific society]] specializing in [[nanotechnology]] and [[DNA computing]].  It was started in 2004 by [[Nadrian Seeman]], founder of the field of [[DNA nanotechnology]].  According to the society, its purpose is "to promote the study of the control of the arrangement of the atoms in matter, examine the principles that lead to such control, to develop tools and methods to increase such control, and to investigate the use of these principles for molecular computation, and for engineering on the finest possible scales."&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=About ISNSCE|url=http://www.isnsce.org/about|publisher=International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.isnsce.org/about/history|publisher=International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ISNSCE sponsors two [[academic conference]]s each year: the first is Foundations of Nanoscience (FNANO), and the second is the International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Computation (DNA Computing).&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;  The FNANO conference has been held in [[Snowbird, Utah]] each year in April since 2004, and focuses on [[molecular self-assembly]] of nanoscale materials and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Overview|url=http://www.cs.duke.edu/FNANO/overview.html|publisher=Duke University|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DNA Computing focuses on [[biomolecular computing]] and DNA nanotechnology, and has been held annually since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming|url=http://www.dna-computing.org/|publisher=International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[proceedings]] of DNA Computing are published as part of the [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] book series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Published proceedings|url=http://www.dna-computing.org/proceedings.html|publisher=International Conference on DNA Computing and Molecular Programming|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
ISNSCE sponsors two awards annually.  The ISNSCE Nanoscience Prize recognizes research in any area of nanoscience, and has been presented at FNANO each year since 2007.  The Tulip Award in DNA Computing is specific to the fields of biomolecular computing and molecular programming, and has been presented at the DNA Computing conference since 2000.  ISNSCE also sponsors two student awards for papers presented at the DNA Computing conference each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ISNCSE Awards|url=http://www.isnsce.org/awards|publisher=International Society for Nanoscale Science, Computation, and Engineering|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tulip Award was first given at the sixth DNA Computing conference, in [[Leiden]], the Netherlands, whose [[Leiden Botanical Garden|botanical garden]] is known as the birthplace of the [[Tulip mania|tulip culture]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DNA6: Sixth International Meeting on DNA Based Computers|url=http://www.lcnc.nl/dna6/dna-booklet.doc|publisher=Leiden Center for Natural Computing|accessdate=4 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tulip"/&gt;

In April 2015, ISNCSE established the [[Robert Dirks]] Molecular Programming Prize to recognize early-career scientists for molecular programming research.  The award was established in memory of Dirks, who was one of the six fatalities of the February 2015 [[Valhalla train crash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://blog.wabash.edu/alumninews/2015/05/01/robert-dirks-00-memorial-prize-announced/|title = Robert Dirks ’00 memorial prize announced|date = 1 May 2015|accessdate = 5 May 2015|website = |publisher = Wabash College|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angular size of patch in atmosphere over which electromagnetic waves in the same plane stay parallel.  The patch size inversely affects the [[Fried_parameter|Fried Parameter]] and the resolution of optical telescopes.  Adaptive [[optical telescope|optical telescopes]] uses a bright light source to identify the properties of the patch in the line of sight to the object of interest to correct for seeing effects.

The '''Latin American Public Opinion Project''' (LAPOP) is a research institute specializing in the development, implementation, and analysis of [[public opinion]] [[survey methodology|surveys]]. Founded by [[Mitchell A. Seligson]] over two decades ago, its principal focus is on governance and democracy in [[Latin America]]. The AmericasBarometer is the best-known survey produced by LAPOP.  It is the only survey of democratic public opinion and behavior that covers the Americas ([[North America|North]], [[Central America|Central]], [[South America|South]], and the [[Caribbean]]). It  measures democratic values and behaviors in the Americas using national probability samples of voting-age adults. [[Elizabeth Zechmeister]] is the director of LAPOP. Noam Lupu is associate director of LAPOP.

== History ==

LAPOP has its origins in studies of [[democracy|democratic values]] in Costa Rica. This pioneering public opinion research took place in the 1970s, a time in which much of the rest of Latin America was under the control of [[authoritarianism|authoritarian regimes]], prohibiting studies of public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/magazines/arts-and-science/2010-11/survey-says/ |title=Vanderbilt University's Arts and Sciences Magazine, Fall 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;   As [[democratization]] expanded in Latin America, LAPOP grew in scope and size. Today LAPOP regularly carries out public opinion surveys in nearly every country in Latin America, Canada, the United States, and much of Caribbean.

== Structure ==

LAPOP is housed at [[Vanderbilt University]] in Nashville, Tennessee. Vanderbilt is a research university that has been a leader in the study of Latin America and the Caribbean for over 60 years. At this host institution, a team of faculty, staff, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate students designs and analyzes the public opinion surveys generated by the project. The group also edits and publishes the regular Insights Series reports, each one of which examines a one facet of public opinion. LAPOP’s network extends far beyond the Vanderbilt campus, to include partner institutions throughout the Americas.

LAPOP functions as a consortium, working in partnership with numerous academic and non-governmental institutions in Latin America and the Caribbean. It collaborates with these institutions, sharing ideas for survey content and working together to disseminate the results of the public opinion surveys to the citizens of participating countries. This dissemination of results takes the form of systematic country reports, comparative studies, panel presentations, and media interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/pdfs/At-a-glance-v2.pdf |title=The AmericasBarometer at a Glance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The AmericasBarometer ==

In 2004, LAPOP established the AmericasBarometer as multi-country, regularly-conducted surveys of democratic values and behaviors in the Americas, organized by a consortium of academic and think-tank partners in the hemisphere. The first round included voting-age respondents from 11 countries. The second round of surveys took place in 2006 and included 22 countries from the hemisphere. The third round, 2008, included 24 countries in the Americas. The 2010 and 2012 round included 26 countries across North America, Latin America, and the Caribbean. The 2014/15 round consisted of over 50,000 interviews in 28 countries. The most recent round, 2016/17, comprises 29 national surveys and more than 43,000 interviews.

== Methods and Practices ==

Cutting-edge methods and transparent practices ensure that data collected by LAPOP are of the highest quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/CAM_Survey_Evaluation_Report_Final_11.29.04.pdf |title=Independent Evaluation of LAPOP Surveys}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These methods and practices include the following:

=== Pre-Survey ===
* Solicitation of input from a vast network of academics, practitioners, and policymakers
* Use of Vanderbilt University’s experimental research lab to test new items
* Extensive in-country pre-testing of survey items
* Translation of surveys into more than 15 [[Latin America#Language|languages]] spoken in the Americas
* Expert design of national [[Survey sampling#Probability sampling|probability samples]]
* Approval from Vanderbilt University’s [[Institutional review board|Institutional Review Board]] for the protection of human subjects

=== Implementation ===
* Rigorous training of all interviewers using guidelines published in extensive training manuals
* Partnerships with reputable survey organizations in the regions
* Widespread use of electronic handheld devices ([[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]] and smartphones) and software designed by LAPOP to allow multilingual interviews and extensive validity checks
* Participants are voting-age adults interviewed face to face in their households, except in Canada and the United States where the interviews are web-based

=== Post-survey ===
* Use of cutting-edge statistical programs and methods
* Presentation of results in clear, user-friendly graphs
* Public dissemination of results in surveyed design and methods on the LAPOP website
* Immediate uploading of data into LAPOP’s free interactive data analysis program

LAPOP’s resources and expertise allow it to conduct special projects requested by scholars, government institutions, and agencies concerned with democratic development. These have recently included novel experiments embedded within national surveys to assess issues of ethnicity and violence. In addition, these include an extensive new focus on randomized block experiments as a means of program evaluation.

== Use of LAPOP Data ==

The data are used by academic researchers; the [[USAID|United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) in its efforts to promote democracy and good governance in Latin America and the Caribbean; the [[World Bank]] in its Governance Indicators series; the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] in its numerous research projects; the [[United Nations Development Programme]] and the [[Organization of American States]] in their democracy programs; and most significantly, by the governments of several Latin American countries as a source of independent information with which to assess public opinion and shape policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/studies-articles-books.php |title=Studies, Articles, and Books Using LAPOP Data}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{styles}}
A '''style guide''' or '''style manual''' is a set of standards for the writing and design of documents, either for general use or for a specific publication, organization or field. The implementation of a style guide provides uniformity in style and formatting within a document and across multiple documents. A set of standards for a specific organization is often known as "house style". Style guides are common for general and specialized use, for the general reading and writing audience, and for students and scholars of various [[academia|academic]] disciplines, medicine, journalism, the law, government, business, and industry.

==International==
Several basic style guides for technical and scientific communication have been defined by international [[standards organization]]s. These are often used as elements of and refined in more specialized style guides that are specific to a subject, region or organization. Some examples are:

'''Memory safety''' is the state of being protected from various [[software bugs]] and [[Vulnerability (computing)|security vulnerabilities]] when dealing with [[random-access memory|memory]] access, such as [[buffer overflow]]s and [[dangling pointer]]s.&lt;ref name=Adve&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dhurjati|first1=Dinakar|last2=Kowshik|first2=Sumant|last3=Adve|first3=Vikram|last4=Lattner|first4=Chris|title=Memory Safety Without Runtime Checks or Garbage Collection|journal=Proceedings of the 2003 ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Language, Compiler, and Tool for Embedded Systems|date=1 January 2003|pages=69–80|doi=10.1145/780732.780743|url=http://llvm.org/pubs/2003-05-05-LCTES03-CodeSafety.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2017|publisher=ACM|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Java (programming language)|Java]] is said to be memory-safe because its [[runtime error detection]] checks array bounds and pointer dereferences.&lt;ref name=Adve /&gt; In contrast, [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]] allow arbitrary [[pointer arithmetic]] with pointers implemented as direct memory addresses with no provision for [[bounds checking]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koenig|first1=Andrew|title=How C Makes It Hard To Check Array Bounds|url=http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/how-c-makes-it-hard-to-check-array-bound/240168083|website=Dr. Dobb's|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus are termed '''memory-unsafe'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Akritidis|first1=Periklis|title=Practical memory safety for C|date=June 2011|url=https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/techreports/UCAM-CL-TR-798.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2017|publisher=University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory|issn=1476-2986|id=UCAM-CL-TR-798}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Memory errors were first considered in the context of [[resource management]] and [[time-sharing]] systems, in an effort to avoid problems such as [[fork bomb]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Anderson,|first1=James P.|title=Computer Security Planning Study|volume=2|url=http://seclab.cs.ucdavis.edu/projects/history/papers/ande72.pdf|publisher=[[Electronic Systems Center]]|id=ESD-TR-73-51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developments were mostly theoretical until the [[Morris worm]], which exploited a buffer overflow in [[fingerd]].&lt;ref name=Veen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=van der Veen|first1=Victor|last2=dutt-Sharma|first2=Nitish|last3=Cavallaro|first3=Lorenzo|last4=Bos|first4=Herbert|title=Memory Errors: The Past, the Present, and the Future|journal=Lecture Notes in Computer Science|volume=7462|issue=RAID 2012|pages=86–106|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-33338-5_5|url=https://www.isg.rhul.ac.uk/sullivan/pubs/tr/technicalreport-ir-cs-73.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field of [[computer security]] developed quickly thereafter, escalating with multitudes of new [[Attack (computing)|attacks]] such as the [[return-to-libc attack]] and defense techniques such as the [[Executable space protection|non-executable stack]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wojtczuk|first1=Rafal|title=Defeating Solar Designer's Non-executable Stack Patch|url=http://insecure.org/sploits/non-executable.stack.problems.html|website=insecure.org|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[address space layout randomization]]. Randomization prevents most [[buffer overflow]] attacks and requires the attacker to use [[heap spraying]] or other application-dependent methods to obtain addresses, although its adoption has been slow.&lt;ref name=Veen/&gt; However, deployments of the technology are typically limited to randomizing libraries and the location of the stack.

== Approaches ==

DieHard,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berger|first1=Emery D.|last2=Zorn|first2=Benjamin G.|title=DieHard: Probabilistic Memory Safety for Unsafe Languages|journal=Proceedings of the 27th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation|date=1 January 2006|pages=158–168|doi=10.1145/1133981.1134000|url=http://www.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/fp014-berger.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=ACM|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; its redesign DieHarder,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novark|first1=Gene|last2=Berger|first2=Emery D.|title=DieHarder: Securing the Heap|journal=Proceedings of the 17th ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security|date=1 January 2010|pages=573–584|doi=10.1145/1866307.1866371|url=https://people.cs.umass.edu/~emery/pubs/ccs03-novark.pdf|accessdate=14 March 2017|publisher=ACM}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Allinea Distributed Debugging Tool]] are special heap allocators that allocate objects in their own random virtual memory page, allowing invalid reads and writes to be stopped and debugged at the exact instruction that causes them. Protection relies upon hardware memory protection and thus overhead is typically not substantial, although it can grow significantly if the program makes heavy use of allocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allinea.com/user-guide/DDTMemoryDebugging.html|title=Memory Debugging in Allinea DDT|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203130856/https://www.allinea.com/user-guide/DDTMemoryDebugging.html|archivedate=2015-02-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Randomization provides only probabilistic protection against memory errors, but can often be easily implemented in existing software by relinking the binary.

The memcheck tool of [[Valgrind]] uses an [[instruction set simulator]] and runs the compiled program in a memory-checking virtual machine, providing guaranteed detection of a subset of runtime memory errors. However, it typically slows the program down by a factor of 40,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gyllenhaal|first1=John|title=Using Valgrind's Memcheck Tool to Find Memory Errors and Leaks|url=https://computing.llnl.gov/code/memcheck/|website=computing.llnl.gov|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore must be explicitly informed of custom memory allocators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memcheck: a memory error detector|url=http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/mc-manual.html#mc-manual.mempools|website=Valgrind User Manual|publisher=valgrind.org|accessdate=13 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kreinin|first1=Yossi|title=Why custom allocators/pools are hard|url=http://yosefk.com/blog/why-custom-allocatorspools-are-hard.html|website=Proper Fixation|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With access to the source code, libraries exist that collect and track legitimate values for pointers ("metadata") and check each pointer access against the metadata for validity, such as the [[Boehm garbage collector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using the Garbage Collector as Leak Detector|url=http://www.hboehm.info/gc/leak.html|website=www.hboehm.info|accessdate=14 March 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, memory safety can be safely assured using [[garbage collection (computer science)|tracing garbage collection]] and the insertion of runtime checks on every memory access; this approach has overhead, but less than that of Valgrind. All garbage-collected languages take this approach.&lt;ref name=Adve/&gt; For C and C++, many tools exist that perform a compile-time transformation of the code to do memory safety checks at runtime, such as CheckPointer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Semantic Designs: CheckPointer compared to other safety checking tools|url=http://www.semanticdesigns.com/Products/MemorySafety/MemorySafetyComparison.html|website=www.semanticdesigns.com|publisher=Semantic Designs, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[AddressSanitizer]] which imposes an average slowdown factor of 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AddressSanitizerPerformanceNumbers
|url=https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerPerformanceNumbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Another approach uses [[static program analysis]] and [[automated theorem proving]] to ensure that the program is free of memory errors. For example, the [[Rust (programming language)|Rust programming language]] implements a borrow checker to ensure memory safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=References|url=https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/nomicon/references.html|website=The Rustonomicon|publisher=Rust.org|accessdate=13 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tools such as [[Coverity]] offer static memory analysis for C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bessey|first1=Al|last2=Engler|first2=Dawson|last3=Block|first3=Ken|last4=Chelf|first4=Ben|last5=Chou|first5=Andy|last6=Fulton|first6=Bryan|last7=Hallem|first7=Seth|last8=Henri-Gros|first8=Charles|last9=Kamsky|first9=Asya|last10=McPeak|first10=Scott|title=A few billion lines of code later|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=1 February 2010|volume=53|issue=2|pages=66–75|doi=10.1145/1646353.1646374|url=http://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69354-a-few-billion-lines-of-code-later/fulltext|accessdate=14 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; C++'s [[smart pointers]] are a limited form of this approach.

== Types of memory errors ==
Many different types of memory errors can occur:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gv|first1=Naveen|title=How to Avoid, Find (and Fix) Memory Errors in your C/C++ Code|url=http://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/memory_debugging_parallel_inspector.html|website=Cprogramming.com|accessdate=13 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CWE-633: Weaknesses that Affect Memory|url=https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/633.html|website=Community Weakness Enumeration|publisher=MITRE|accessdate=13 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Access errors''': invalid read/write of a pointer
** '''[[Buffer overflow]]''' - out-of-bound writes can corrupt the content of adjacent objects, or internal data (like bookkeeping information for the [[Memory management#Dynamic memory allocation|heap]]) or [[Return statement|return]] addresses.
** '''[[Buffer over-read]]''' - out-of-bound reads can reveal sensitive data or help attackers bypass [[address space layout randomization]].
** '''[[Race condition]]''' - concurrent reads/writes to shared memory
** '''[[Page fault#Invalid|Invalid page fault]]''' - accessing a pointer outside the virtual memory space. A null pointer dereference will often cause an exception or program termination in most environments, but can cause corruption in operating system [[Kernel (computing)|kernels]] or systems without [[memory protection]], or when use of the null pointer involves a large or negative offset.
** '''Use after free''' - dereferencing a [[dangling pointer]] storing the address of an object that has been deleted.
* '''[[Uninitialized variable]]s''' - a variable that has not been assigned a value is used. It may contain an undesired or, in some languages, a corrupt value.
** '''[[Null pointer]] dereference''' - dereferencing an invalid pointer or a pointer to memory that has not been allocated
** '''[[Wild pointer]]s''' arise when a pointer is used prior to initialization to some known state. They show the same erratic behaviour as dangling pointers, though they are less likely to stay undetected.
* '''[[Memory leak]]''' - when memory usage is not tracked or tracked incorrectly
** '''[[Stack overflow|Stack exhaustion]]''' - occurs when a program runs out of stack space, typically because of too deep [[Recursion (computer science)|recursion]]. A [[memory protection|guard page]] typically halts the program, preventing memory corruption, but functions with large [[stack frame]]s may bypass the page.
** '''[[Out of memory|Heap exhaustion]]''' - the program tries to [[memory allocation|allocate]] more memory than the amount available. In some languages, this condition must be checked for manually after each allocation.
** '''Double free''' - repeated calls to [[malloc|free]] may prematurely free a new object at the same address. If the exact address has not been reused, other corruption may occur, especially in allocators that use [[free list]]s.
** '''Invalid free''' - passing an invalid address to [[malloc|free]] can corrupt the [[Memory management#Dynamic memory allocation|heap]].
** '''Mismatched free''' - when multiple allocators are in use, attempting to free memory with a deallocation function of a different allocator&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CWE-762: Mismatched Memory Management Routines|url=https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/762.html|website=Community Weakness Enumeration|publisher=MITRE|accessdate=13 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** '''Unwanted [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]]''' - when the same memory location is allocated and modified twice for unrelated purposes.

In electronics, the '''NORBIT''' family of modules is a very early form (since 1960&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBLE_1962_Norbit"/&gt;) of [[Digital electronics|digital logic]] developed by [[Philips]] (and also provided through {{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}} and [[Mullard]]&lt;ref name="TM2671_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TM2672_1967"/&gt;) that uses modules containing discrete components to build logic function blocks in [[resistor–transistor logic]] (RTL)&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt; or [[diode–transistor logic]] (DTL) technology.

==Overview==
The system was originally conceived as building blocks for [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]]&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBLE_1962_Norbit"/&gt; hard-wired programmed logic controllers (the predecessors of [[programmable logic controller]]s (PLC)) to replace electro-mechanical [[relay logic]] in [[industrial control system]]s for [[process control]] and [[automation]] applications, similar to early [[Telefunken]]/[[AEG]] [[Logistat]], [[Siemens]] {{ill|Simatic|de}}, [[BBC]] [[Sigmatronic]], [[ACEC (company)|ACEC]] [[Logacec]] or {{ill|Akkord-Radio{{!}}Akkord|de|Akkord-Radio}} [[Estacord]] systems.&lt;!-- and Mibakron modules by Krone KG, Berlin, other systems: Bistat, Norlog --&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Akkord_Estacord"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Klingelnberg_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Weissel_1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker_2012"/&gt;

Each available logical function was recognizable by the color of its plastic container, black, blue, red, green, violet, etc. The most important circuit block contained a [[Logical NOR|NOR]] gate (hence the name), but there were also blocks containing drivers, and a timer circuit similar to the later [[555 timer IC]].&lt;ref name="R1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R3"/&gt;

The original ''Norbit'' modules of the YL&amp;nbsp;6000 series introduced in 1960 had [[potting (electronics)|potted]] [[single in-line package]]s with up to ten long flying leads arranged in two groups of up to five leads in a row.&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MBLE_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt; These modules were specified for frequencies of less than 1&amp;nbsp;kHz at ±24&amp;nbsp;V supply.&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Norbit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt;

Also available in 1960 were so called ''Combi-Element''&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wireless-World_1960"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_3"/&gt; modules in single-in line packages with ten evenly spaced stiff leads in a row (5.08&amp;nbsp;mm / 0.2-inch pitch) for mounting on a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]].&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mullard_1963_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gossel_1965"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barneveld_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt; They were grouped in the 1-series (aka "100&amp;nbsp;kHz series")&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_1"/&gt; with ±6&amp;nbsp;V supply.&lt;ref name="Mullard_1962_Combi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Valvo_1964_Norbit"/&gt; The newer 10-series and 20-series had similarly sized packages, but came with an additional parallel row of nine staggered leads for a total of 19 leads.&lt;ref name="Barneveld_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="R2"/&gt; The 10-series uses [[germanium]] [[alloy transistor]]s, whereas in the 20-series [[silicon]] [[planar transistor]]s are used for a higher cut-off frequency of up to 1&amp;nbsp;MHz (vs. 30&amp;nbsp;kHz) and a higher allowed temperature range of +85&amp;nbsp;°C (vs. +55&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="Barneveld_1967"/&gt;

In 1967, the Philips/Mullard NORBIT&amp;nbsp;2&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Elektuur_1967"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Philips_1967_NORBIT2"/&gt; aka Valvo NORBIT-S&lt;ref name="R6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Folkert_1973"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_4"/&gt; family of modules was introduced, first consisting of the 60-series&lt;ref name="R4"/&gt; for frequencies up to 10&amp;nbsp;kHz at a single supply voltage of 24&amp;nbsp;V,&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt; only. Later, the 61-series,&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt; containing [[thyristor]] trigger and control modules, was added. A 90-series&lt;ref name="Philips_1980"/&gt;&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_2"/&gt; became available in the mid-1970s as well. There were three basic types contained in a large (one by two inch-sized) 17 pins [[dual in-line package]], with nine pins spaced 5.08&amp;nbsp;mm (0.2-inch) on one side and eight staggered pins on the other side.&lt;ref name="R3A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dean_1973"/&gt;

== Notes ==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_1"&gt;Some later &lt;!-- 1980 --&gt;datasheets distinguished between the 100&amp;nbsp;kHz series and the 1-series.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_2"&gt;The modules of the 90-series&lt;!-- 1980 --&gt; were grouped into the 60-series in early&lt;!-- 1974 --&gt; datasheets.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_3"&gt;[[Mullard]] called these modules ''Combi-Element'' in the UK, whereas [[Philips]] and {{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}} just called them circuit blocks, but distinguished them from the original ''Norbit'' series.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_4"&gt;So far, the assumed equivalence of {{ill|Valvo (company){{!}}Valvo|de|Valvo}}'s Norbit-S series with the [[Philips]] Norbit&amp;nbsp;2 series is based on their release date in 1967. Often, the modules of the newer families were still referred to as ''Norbits'' only.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanoprobing''' is method of extracting device [[Current–voltage characteristic|electrical parameters]] through the use of nanoscale tungsten wires, used primarily in the semiconductor industry. The characterization of individual devices is instrumental to engineers and [[integrated circuit]] designers during initial product development and debug. It is commonly utilized in device [[failure analysis]] laboratories to aid with yield enhancement, quality and reliability issues and customer returns. Commercially available nanoprobing systems are integrated into either a vacuum-based [[scanning electron microscope]] (SEM) or [[atomic force microscope]] (AFM). Nanoprobing systems that are based on AFM technology are referred to as Atomic Force nanoProbers (AFP).

== Principles and operation ==
AFM based nanoprobers, enable up to eight probe tips to be scanned to generate high resolution AFM topography images, as well as Conductive AFM, Scanning Capacitance, and Electrostatic Force Microscopy images. Conductive AFM provides pico-amp resolution to identify and localize electrical failures such as shorts, opens, resistive contacts and leakage paths, enabling accurate probe positioning for current-voltage measurements. AFM based nanoprobers enable nanometer scale device defect localization and accurate transistor device characterization without the physical damage and electrical bias induced by high energy electron beam exposure.

[[File:Nanoprobes Over SRAM devices.jpg|thumb|right|A high magnification image of tungsten nanoprobes landed on a [[Static random-access memory|SRAM]] device.]]
For SEM based nanoprobers, the ultra-high resolution of the microscopes that house the nanoprobing system allow the operator to navigate the probe tips with precise movement, allowing the user to see exactly where the tips will be landed, in real time. Existing nanoprobe needles or “probe tips” have a typical end-point radius ranging from 5 to 35&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Toh | first1 = S. L. | last2 = Tan | first2 = P.

Navigation of the probe tips in SEM based nanoprobers are typically controlled by precision [[piezoelectric]] manipulators. Typical systems have anywhere from 2 to 8 probe manipulators with high end tools having better than 5&amp;nbsp;nm of placement resolution in the X, Y &amp; Z axes and a high accuracy sample stage for navigation of the sample under test.

'''Noise regulation''' includes [[statute]]s or guidelines relating to sound transmission established by national, state or provincial and [[municipal]] levels of government. After the watershed passage of the United States [[Noise Control Act|Noise Control Act of 1972]],&lt;ref name="92-574"&gt;U.S. Noise Pollution and Abatement Act of 1972, P.L. 92-574, 86 Stat. 1234, {{Usc|42|4901}} - {{Usc|42|4918}}&lt;/ref&gt; other local and state governments passed further regulations.

A noise regulation{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} restricts the amount of noise, the duration of noise and the source of noise. It usually places restrictions for certain times of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.kineticsnoise.com/industrial/noise_ordinance.html|title= Noise Ordinance
|publisher= Kinetics Noise Control, Inc|accessdate=2012-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Japan]] enacted national laws in 1960 and 1967 respectively, these laws were not at all comprehensive or fully enforceable as to address generally rising ambient noise, enforceable numerical source limits on aircraft and motor vehicles or comprehensive directives to local government.

==History==

===United States initial legislation===
In the 1960s and earlier, few people recognized that citizens might be entitled to be protected from adverse sound level exposure.  Most concerted actions consisted of citizens groups organized to oppose a specific highway or airport, and occasionally a [[nuisance]] [[lawsuit]] would arise. Things in the United States changed rapidly with passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] (NEPA) in 1969 and the Noise Pollution and Abatement Act, more commonly called the Noise Control Act (NCA), in 1972. Passage of the NCA was remarkable considering the lack of historic organized citizen concern. However, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) had testified before [[United States Congress|Congress]] that 30 million Americans are exposed to non-[[occupational]] noise high enough to cause [[hearing loss]] and 44 million Americans live in homes impacted by aircraft or highway noise.&lt;ref&gt;Noise Control Act, Public Law 92-574, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 94-301,1976&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public law 95-609, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Amendment, Public Law 100-418, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

NEPA requires all federally funded major actions to be analyzed for all physical environmental impacts including [[noise pollution]], and the NCA directed the EPA to promulgate regulations for a host of noise emissions. Many city [[local ordinance|ordinances]] prohibit sound above a threshold intensity from trespassing over property line at night, typically between 9 p.m. to 7 a.m., and during the day restricts it to a higher sound level; however, enforcement is uneven. Many municipalities do not follow up on complaints. Even where a municipality has an enforcement office, it may only be willing to issue warnings, since taking offenders to court is expensive. A notable exception to this rule is the City of [[Government of Portland, Oregon|Portland, Oregon]], which has instituted an aggressive protection for its citizens with fines reaching as high at $5000 per infraction, with the ability to cite a responsible noise violator multiple times in a single day.&lt;ref&gt;"City of Portland Code and Charter." Title 18, Chapter 18.18 [http://www.portlandonline.com/auditor/index.cfm?c=28714#cid_18511 "Title 18 Noise Control"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Occupational Safety and Health Act (United States)|Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970]], employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]'s role is to ensure these conditions for America's working men and women by setting and enforcing standards, and providing training, education and assistance. The same Act charges the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) with recommending occupational safety and health standards. NIOSH communicates these recommended standards to regulatory agencies (including OSHA) and to others in the occupational safety and health community through the publication and dissemination of Criteria Documents such as the Criteria for A Recommended Standard - Occupational Noise Exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-126/default.html|title=Occupational Noise Exposure|last=NIOSH|first=|date=1998|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Follow-up on initial U.S. laws===
Initially these laws had a significant effect on thoughtful study of transportation programs and also federally funded [[House|housing]] programs in the United States.  They also gave [[U.S. state|states]] and cities an impetus to consider environmental noise in their [[land use planning|planning]] and [[zoning]] decisions, and led to a host of statutes below the federal level.  Awareness of the need for noise control was rising. In fact, by 1973 a national poll of 60,000 U.S. residents found that sixty percent of people considered street noise to have a "disturbing, harmful or dangerous" impact.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development survey. As reported by Kenneth Eldred at the Fifth International Congress on Noise as an International Problem, Sweden, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

This trend continued strongly throughout the 1970s in the U.S., with about half of the states and hundreds of cities passing substantive noise control laws. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] coordinated all federal noise control activities through its Office of Noise Abatement and Control. The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] phased out the office's funding in 1982 as part of a shift in federal noise control policy to transfer the primary responsibility of regulating noise to state and local governments. However, the Noise Control Act of 1972 and the Quiet Communities Act of 1978 were never rescinded by Congress and remain in effect today, although essentially unfunded.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/history/epa-history-noise-and-noise-control-act|title=EPA History: Noise and the Noise Control Act|last=EPA|first=|date=1982|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) regulates [[aircraft noise]] by specifying the maximum noise level that individual civil aircraft can emit through requiring aircraft to meet certain noise certification standards. These standards designate changes in maximum noise level requirements by "stage" designation. The U.S. noise standards are defined in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Title 14 Part 36 – Noise Standards: Aircraft Type and Airworthiness Certification (14 CFR Part 36). The [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] also pursues a program of aircraft noise control in cooperation with the aviation community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|last=FAA|first=|date=Jan 9, 2018|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) developed noise regulations to control [[Roadway noise|highway noise]] as required by the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1970. The regulations requires promulgation of traffic noise-level criteria for various land use activities, and describe procedures for the abatement of highway traffic noise and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/noise/|title=Highway Traffic Noise|last=FHWA|first=|date=June 5, 2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=Jul 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some states continued to act. California carried out an ambitious plan to require its cities to establish a "Noise Element of the General Plan," which provides guidance for land planning decisions to minimize noise impacts on the public.  Many cities throughout the U.S. also have noise ordinances, which specifies the allowable sound level that can cross property lines. These ordinances can be enforced with local [[Police power (United States constitutional law)|police power]]s.&lt;ref name="Local ords"&gt;Noise Pollution Clearinghouse, Montpelier, VT. [http://www.nonoise.org/lawlib/cities/cities.htm "Noise Regulations &amp; Ordinances of U.S. Cities, Counties and Towns."] Accessed 2010-08-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
[[Japan]] actually passed the first national noise control act, but its scope was much more limited than the U.S. law, addressing mainly workplace and construction noise.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Japan. Ministry of Environment. Law No. 98 of 1968. Latest amendment by Law No. 91 of 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe and Asia===
Several European countries emulated the U.S. national noise control law: Netherlands (1979), France (1985), Spain (1993), and Denmark (1994). In some cases unlegislated innovations have led to quieter products exceeding legal mandates (for example, hybrid vehicles or best available technology in washing machines). [[Environmental noise]] is a special definition in the [[Directive (European Union)|European directive]] 2002/49/EC article 10.1.

==Local noise ordinances in U.S. and Europe==
[[Local ordinance]]s are principally aimed at construction noise, power equipment operated by individuals and unmuffled [[industrial noise]] penetrating residential areas. Thousands of U.S. cities have prepared noise ordinances that give [[noise control]] officers and police the power to investigate noise complaints and enforcement power to abate the offending noise source, through shutdowns and fines.&lt;ref name="Local ords" /&gt; In the 1970s and early 1980s there was even a professional association for noise enforcement officers called NANCO, "National Association of Noise Control Officials."

Today only a handful of properly trained Noise Control Officers remain in the United States. A typical noise ordinance sets forth clear definitions of acoustic nomenclature and defines categories of noise generation; then numerical standards are established, so that enforcement personnel can take the necessary steps of warnings, fines or other municipal police power to rectify unacceptable noise generation.  Ordinances have achieved certain successes but they can be thorny to implement. Many European cities are still treating noise as the U.S. did in the 1960s, as a nuisance and not as a numerical standard to be achieved.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}
* Effects of Noise on Health and Welfare
&lt;ref&gt;Kryter, K.D., "The Effects of Noise on Man”, Academic Press, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berglund, B, Lindvall, T, Schwela, D. "Guidelines for Community Noise", World Health Organization, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Public Health and Welfare Criteria for Noise, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency,  EPA 550/9-73-002, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information on levels of Environmental Noise Requisite to Protect Public Health and Welfare with an Adequate Margin of Safety, US Environmental Agency, Office of Noise Abatement and Control, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

One obligation of a community is to protect its citizens from adverse environmental influences.  Noise is one of these factors, Noise has documented effects on people, they can be divided into three types.  The first type is a physical effect that directly and adversely effects a person's health. Hearing loss and vibration of bodily components are examples. The second type is a physiological effect that adversely effects a person's health; heightened blood pressure and general stress response are examples.  The third type is psychological that adversely effects a person's welfare; examples are distraction, annoyance, and complaint.
	The only feasible legal basis for a community’s right to control noise is based on these adverse health and welfare effects.  It is clearly easier to uphold the constitutionality of a noise ordinance in a court of law if it can be shown that it is based on health and welfare concerns.  The following is a short list of recognized effects of noise that can be addressed as a reason for a noise ordinance.
:Excess non-Occupational noise exposure, hearing loss on both public and private property, speech interference on both public and private property, audio interference on both public and private property, and sleep interference on mostly private property.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnet, M.H., Arand, D.L., Heart Rate Variability: Sleep Stage, Time of Night, and Arousal Influences" Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, Wright State University, and Kettering Medical Center, Dayton, OH, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Some legal considerations in the United States===
There are several fundamental issues that shape the legality, effectiveness and enforceability of any community noise regulation.

====Preemption====
The federal government has preempted certain areas of noise regulation. They can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations under the EPA Noise Abatement Programs;&lt;ref&gt;Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40 - Protection of Environment, Chapter I - Environmental Protection Agency, Subchapter G - Noise Abatement Programs&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?collectionCode=CFR&amp;searchPath=Title+40%2FChapter+I%2FSubchapter+G&amp;granuleId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25-chapI-subchapG&amp;packageId=CFR-2011-title40-vol25&lt;/ref&gt; Parts 201 to 205 and 211 cover railroads, motor carriers in interstate commerce, construction equipment, motor vehicles.  They require product labeling and prohibit tampering with noise control devices.  Communities may enact regulations that are no more strict than the federal ones so that local enforcement can be carried out.  They can enact curfews and restrict vehicle use in established zones such as residential.  Any restriction on interstate motor carriers or railroads may NOT be for the purpose of noise control.
States have police powers granted by the Constitution.  They may also enact regulations that are no more strict than federal regulations. They may also preempt local ordinances.  California &lt;ref&gt;California Health and Safety Code 46000-46080&lt;/ref&gt; and New Jersey&lt;ref&gt;NJAC 7:29&lt;/ref&gt; have comprehensive noise codes that communities must meet. Many states required that local ordinances be no more strict than the state code whether such code exists or not.  One relatively common preemption is protection of shooting ranges from noise regulation or litigation&lt;ref&gt;Arizona Revised Statutes, Chapter 17-602&lt;/ref&gt; and right to farm laws that protect agricultural areas from nuisance litigation by encroaching residential areas.&lt;ref&gt;Florida Right to Farm Act Article, pp.823-14{{Clarify pp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitutional vagueness====
In one case, the United States Supreme Court has said [[Void for vagueness]]
“It is a basic principle of due process (Amendment V) that an enactment is void for vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined. Vague laws offend several important values. First, because we assume that man is free to steer between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so that he may act accordingly. Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing ''fair warning''.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and juries for resolution on an ad hoc and subjective basis, with the attendant dangers of ''arbitrary and discriminatory application''.  Third, but related, where a vague statute abuts upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms, it operates to inhibit the exercise of those freedoms. (the chilling effect).  In one case,&lt;ref&gt;State of New Jersey vs. Clarksburg Inn, 375 N.J. Super. 624, 868 A.2s 112, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; the court declared that numerical sound levels were constitutional as well as the term ''plainly audible'' provided it was associated with a reasonable distance. Two requirements for a noise ordinance provision is that:
#provide fair warning
#avoid the possibility of arbitrary enforcement

====Free Speech====
Examples are: slander, hate speech, and [[Shouting fire in a crowded theater|falsely calling "fire" in an assembly]]. Generally, the time, place, or manner of restrictions must:
#be content neutral
#be narrowly tailored
#serve a significant government interest
#leave open alternative channels of communication
One example&lt;ref&gt;Madsen vs. Women's Health Center&lt;/ref&gt; concerned protesters outside an abortion clinic.  The US Supreme Court stated that limitations placed on noise making were necessary to ensure the well-being of patients.

====Overbreadth====
The US Supreme Court has addressed the issue of too much regulation by defining overbreadth as: ''A clear, precise enactment may nevertheless be overbroad if, in its reach, it prohibits constitutionally protected conduct.'' One means to avoid being overbroad is by having provisions that are specific so that potential violators are given fair warning of what is prohibited. In one case &lt;ref&gt;Grayned vs. City of Rockford, 408 US 104 (19720&lt;/ref&gt; the court ruled that the specificity of the city ordinance (Section 17-35) regulating school verbal protests was not ''constitutionally vague'', gave ''fair warning'', and was not an invitation to arbitrary enforcement and so was not overbroad, despite the implied limitation on free speech.

====Nuisance====
Nuisances are part of tort law. Torts are civil wrongs whether intentional or accidental from which injury occurs to another. Nuisances can be public or private.  A public nuisance is an unreasonable interference with a right common to the general public while a private nuisance is an interference with a person's enjoyment and use of his land. [[Black's Law Dictionary]] defines a nuisance as''... that which annoys and disturbs one in possession of his property, rendering its ordinary use and occupation physically uncomfortable to him.''  It defines a private nuisance as:..''anything done to the hurt or annoyance of the lands, tenements, or hereditaments of another.  As distinguished from public nuisance, it includes any wrongful act which destroys or deteriorates the property of an individual or of a few persons or interferes with their lawful use or enjoyment thereof, or any act which unlawfully hinders them in the enjoyment of a common or public right and causes them a special injury different from that sustained by the general public.'' The word ''nuisance'' is connected closely with the word ''disturbance'' which is used extensively in many noise ordinances. A definition below further restricts the meaning to ''noise disturbance''.  Nuisance law applies to both community noise regulation as well as private suits brought to court to reduce noise impact.

====Enforceability====
Care must be taken in writing a ''subjective'' noise provision so that it overcomes the objections listed above. Care must be taken when writing an ''objective'' noise provision to make sure that the sound levels are physically realizable.  For example, requiring the maximum sound level of an automobile to be 40&amp;nbsp;dB(A) or the maximum sound level in a residential zone to be 30&amp;nbsp;dB(A) opens the provision to an enforceability challenge

====Confiscation====
Confiscation is the taking of private property for public use without compensation. It may occur legally when the government seizes property used in illegal practices.    Confiscation may occur without an arrest of a person because it is seen as an arrest of property, rather than a person, and the necessity of finding a party guilty is not required in all cases. In many cases, the guilt or innocence of the property owner is irrelevant and the government need not prove anything ''beyond a reasonable doubt''. In order to seize property, there must be either a warrant or a showing of probable cause. The mere showing of probable cause to support the forfeiture of an individual’s property has been a controversial issue. Court opinion varies, but probable cause most often means that the government need only demonstrate reasonable grounds for the belief that the property is properly subject to forfeiture, which can be supported by something less than prima facie proof, but more than mere suspicion. The Peoria, Illinois noise ordinance (Sections 15-75 and 15-77) allows confiscation of vehicles that emit excessive sound caused by sound producing devices. Colorado Springs, Colorado (Section 9.8.102) permits confiscation of sound producing devices.

===Four Types of Noise Regulation===
&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fixed sound sources must be treated differently than moving sources.  In the former case, the listener is normally defined while for moving sources it is not.  Historically, regulations were enforced by the subjective judgment of an enforcing officer.  With the advent of sound measuring equipment, the judgment can be based on measured sound levels. Most comprehensive noise ordinances contain four types of provisions.

'''Subjective Emission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the output of a sound source is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' terms on public property as a criterion are examples.

'''Subjective Immission'''
These regulations allow an official to ''decide'' if the sound received by a listener is acceptable ''without'' recourse to sound measurements and without regard for the specific sound power generated by the source.. Regulations with ''plainly audible'' or ''noise disturbance'' terms on private property as a criterion are examples.

'''Objective Emission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the output of a sound source to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the presence of a specific listener. Regulations with specific maximum sound output levels for motor vehicles are examples.

'''Objective Immission'''
These regulations require an official to ''measure'' the sound received by a listener to determine whether it is acceptable ''without'' regard to the specific sound power generated by the source.  Regulations with maximum allowable sound levels on property lines are examples

===Some Definitions used in the United States===
many communities have definitions that are local to them, such as those defining motor vehicles and sound levels and sound level  measurements.  Some that have been added to make noise enforcement more specific are listed here.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Engine Braking Device====
A compression braking device installed on large motor vehicles to assist in reduction, or control, of vehicle speed.  When activated, the engine converts from a power source to a power absorber by converting the engine into an air compressor.

====Muffler====
Any device for the abatement of sound emission while permitting the transfer of gas.  A muffler is considered to be in good working order if the sound reduction is equal to, or greater than, that of the original equipment.

====Noise Disturbance====
Any sound or vibration which:
# may disturb or annoy reasonable persons of normal sensitivities or;
# causes, or tends to cause, an adverse effect on the public health and welfare or;
# endangers or injures people or;
# endangers or injures personal or real property.
This can also be defined as ''noise nuisance''.

====Place of Public Entertainment====
Any location, exterior, or interior, to a building that regularly permits public entrance for entertainment purposes.  For this purpose, “public” means citizens of all types, including but not limited to, children, and private or public employees.

====Plainly Audible Sound====
Any sound for which the information content is unambiguously communicated to the listener, such as, but not limited to, understandable speech, comprehension of whether a voice is raised or normal, repetitive bass sounds, or comprehension of musical rhythms, without the aid of any listening device.

====Powered Model Vehicle====
Any self-propelled airborne, water-borne, or land-borne, plane, vessel, or vehicle, which is not designed to carry persons, including, but not limited to, any model airplane, boat, car, or rocket.

====Real Property Boundary====
An imaginary line along the ground surface, and its vertical extension, which separates the real property owned by one person from that owned by another person, but not including intra-building real property divisions.

====Sound Reproduction Device====
Any device, instrument, mechanism, equipment or apparatus for the amplification of any sounds from any radio, phonograph, stereo, tape player, musical instrument, television, loudspeaker or other sound-making or sound-producing device or any device or apparatus for the reproduction or amplification of the human voice or other sound.

====Vibration Perception Threshold====
The minimum ground or structure borne vibrational motion necessary to cause a person of normal sensitivity to be aware of the motion through contact, hearing, or through visual observation of moving things.

===Ordinance Provisions for Stationary Sources in the United States===
there are three levels of regulation for stationary sound sources. The most basic is the general one associated with noise disturbance. (See Noise Disturbance below.) It is a very broad ''subjective immission'' control that has evolved from earlier disturbance of the peace provisions. Subjectivity can lead to arbitrary enforcement. The next level of regulation is less broad; it is an ''objective immission'' control that uses specific levels of sound considered to be a noise disturbance.  Arbitrary enforcement is reduced. (See Maximum Permissible Sound Levels below.) In both cases, however, the person creating the sound may not be aware that his actions are in violation.  The concept that a potential violator should have ''fair warning'' that his actions are in violation has led to provisions that address specific noise problems.  The sections below list those that are found in community noise ordinances.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Air Conditioning, Heating and Pool Equipment====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  An evaluation of the noise disturbance is made at the listener without a sound level meter. This provision is mostly applied in residential zones such as homes, apartments and condominiums.  Albuquerque, NM (Article 9-9) requires that such units the maximum permissible sound levels (Se section below) and recommend that those units be placed away from other residential units or on roof tops to diminish impact.

====Airport and Airport Operations====
Community control of airport created noise is limited to those sounds ''not'' related to flight operations.  The community is able to control the land use around the airport however.

====Animals====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  Most relate to barking dogs and put an upper time limit for continuous sound from them.  New Jersey (Chapter 13:1G) considers a violation if the sound is continuous for more than 5 minutes or intermittent for more than 20 minutes.  They also consider it a defense to violation if the animal is provoked to bark. Connecticut (Chapter 442)exempts animal sounds while Anchorage, AK (Chapter 15.70) requires that continual violations permit the animal to be taken and put out for adoption.

====Authorized Outdoor Discharge of Firearms and Shooting Ranges====
This provision contains only a curfew since most states protect shooting ranges from liability for noise disturbance.  It can include a curfew requirement and a requirement for a public hearing if expansion of the range is desired.  The provision may prohibit other weapons such as rocket propelled projectiles but may exempt unpowered weapons such as arrows. South Carolina (title 31 Chapter 18) requires that a sign stating '''SHOOTING RANGE-NOISE AREA''' be placed on all primary roads. Arizona (ARS 17-602) places a curfew from 10pm to 7 am.  It also allows a tradeoff between the number of events and the maximum permitted sound level. New York (Chapter 150) also trades off overall levels with the duration of the sounds. Colorado (Article 25-12-109) declared that noise restrictions on shooting ranges is a detriment to public health, welfare, and morale.

====Condominiums and Apartments====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It is designed to limit the noise disturbance between living units as defined by an enforcement official.  One criterion used to evaluate that disturbance is use of ''plainly audible'' but at the location of the listener instead of at a specific distance.  However, Charlotte, NC (Sec. 15-69) limits indoor levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) be tween 9am to 9pm and 5&amp;nbsp;dB less at other times, but only from sound reproducing devices. Salt Lake Valley Health Department (Chapter 4), Minneapolis, MN (Chapter 389), and Albuquerque, NM (Article 9) use levels to existing ambient to define a violation. Albuquerque NM and Omaha, NE (Chapter 17) require that intruding sounds not be audible. Burlington, VT (Chapter 18) requires that renters be supplied with the city noise ordinance.

====Construction====
This provision can be both a ''subjective immission'' control and an ''objective emission'' control. Normally there are daily curfews and in some case weekend curfews.  The subjective aspect is to prevent noise disturbance in the adjacent community.  The objective aspect is to control the sound output of specific machines.  There are four major sources of site noise: (1) direct sound from continually operating equipment such as air compressors; (2) intermittent sound from equipment such as jack hammers;(3)backup alarms; and (4) hauling equipment such as trucks. Air compressor noise is regulated by CFR 204 and backup alarms are regulated by CFR 1926.  Boston, MA(Section 16-26.4)  permits construction on weekdays between 7am and 6 pm. Madison, WI (Chapter 24.08) limits sound levels to 88&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 Feet. Miami, FL (Section 36-6) considers the noise a noise disturbance if it occurs between 6pm and 8am during the week and any time on Sunday. Dallas, TX (Section 30-2 (9)) permits construction in residential zones from 7am to 7pm on weekdays, from 9am to 7pm on Saturdays and Holidays, and prohibits construction on Sundays.  Albuquerque, New Mexico (Section 9-9-8) has a more complex control. It prohibits construction and demolition within 500 feet of noise sensitive properties (residences included) if the equipment sound control devices are less effective than the original equipment and if noise mitigation measures are not used when the levels exceed 90&amp;nbsp;dB (weighting not specified) or more than 80&amp;nbsp;dB during the day for three days.

====Domestic and Commercial Power Tools====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is used in residential zones as well as in commercial areas abutting residential zones.  Portland, OR (Title 18.10.030) has several ways to handle these tools. They separate ''outdoor'' and ''indoor'' use to different maximum levels at the property line. They have a night curfew and separate 5 HP tools from higher powered tools.  Madison WI (Chapter 24.08) has similar HP restrictions.  Albuquerque, NM (Title 9-9-7) restricts locations to more than 500 feet from residential and noise sensitive zones. Dallas, TX(Sec. 30-2) exempts lawn maintenance tools during daylight hours. Green Bay, WI (Subchapter II – 27.201) exempts snow removal tools.

====Explosives, Firearms, Impulsive Sources, and Similar Devices====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It is for impulsive sound sources that are not associated with construction activities or shooting ranges. Many communities use the Maximum Permissible Sound Levels criterion (see below), with a correction for the character of the sound. Illinois () sets maximum blasting levels by land use zone and in three time categories. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.010.F) limits levels to 100&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 7am to 10pm and 80&amp;nbsp;dB (peak) from 10pm to 7 am.

====Fracking Operations====
Hydraulic Fracturing operations generate site sound as well as vehicle sound and several different provisions are required to control it.  Federal law regulates the levels of certain site machinery.  A ''subjective immission'' control or an ''objective immission'' control can be applied to surrounding neighborhoods. See maximum Permissible Sound Levels.  Motor vehicle sound is mostly off-site so vehicle noise regulations are applicable. See Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-way.
The State of New York has announced a statewide ban on such operations. Buffalo, NY and Pittsburgh, PA have announced a ban.  Colorado has numerous activities to stop fracking.

====Funerals====
This is a ''subjective emission'' control to reduce the excessive shouting and protests that can surround funeral proceedings.  It makes use of the ''plainly audible'' term and so adds a distance criterion.  There are certain groups, particularly those that object to involvement in foreign wars, who believe it is an obligation to disrupt and picket funerals, especially those of deceased military veterans.  This provision must not infringe on Constitutionally protected free speech. Illinois h(720 ILCS 5/26 6)has a comprehensive provision covering more aspects of this event than noise.  They failed to use “plainly audible” which is narrower than “audible”.  Utah(Section 76-9-108) restricts disruptive activity to beyond 200 feet.

====Loading and Unloading Operations====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  Operations in commercial facilities can impact adjacent residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.03) places a curfew on such operations between 10pm and 7am but only if the source is within 200 feet of a residence. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2830) permits night operations unless they create a noise disturbance. Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.6) prohibits noise disturbance between 7pm and 7am.

====Maximum Permissible Sound Pressure Levels====
This provision is an ''objective immission'' control.  It requires the measurement of sound levels at or beyond a property line and its vertical extension. There are several methods for implementing such a provision:
# It may not permit any exceedence or may permit exceedence only for a percentage of the measurement period. 
# It may require the measurement method to be instantaneous, such as dB(A) or time-averaged, such as Energy Equivalent Level (Leq).
# It may be a fixed level limit, such as 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A), or it may be a level relative to the ambient sound, such as 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) above the ambient.
# It may require measurement of the frequency spectrum, such as one octave bands, or A-weighting, such as dB(A).
# It may define different maximum levels based on zoning criteria, such as residential, commercial, or industrial.
# It may define different maximum levels based on time-of-day or day-of-week, such as reduced maxima during night hours or on weekends.
# It may require reduction of maximum levels based on the character of the sound, such as intermittent or impulsive.
# It may exempt certain classes of sound sources, such as shooting ranges, farm equipment, emergency equipment, railroads, or licensed activities.
most noise ordinances set maximum levels for two time periods: Day (7am to 10pm) and Night (10pm to 7am).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix A&lt;/ref&gt; San Diego (Article 9.25)sets three periods:  Day (7am to 7pm), Evening (7pm to 10pm), and Night (10pm to 7am) and exempts industrial zones from time based restrictions.  Seattle, WA (Chapter 25.08) sets two time periods but changes 7am to 9am on weekends and holidays.  Several states have maximum permissible land use sound levels in dB(A). Most have Day and Night periods and three use categories: residential, Commercial and Industrial. Washington{{vague|state? D.C.?|date=September 2015}} (Chapter 70.107) sets maximum levels in dB(A) but allows 5&amp;nbsp;dB(A) more if the sound is only 15 minutes in an hour, or 10&amp;nbsp;dB(A) for 5 minutes in an hour.  Numerous cities have fixed levels, permitting excess levels for short times (e.g., Dallas, TX, Chapter 30) while others use Leq (Lincoln, NE, Chapter 8.24). Los Angeles, CA (Chapter XI) uses a relative level with a stated but ''presumed'' ambient.  New York City, NY (Chapter 19) requires Leq measurements to be made over one hour.  Atlanta, GA (){{vague|"()"|date=September 2015}} limits impulsive sound to 100&amp;nbsp;dB(C) at property lines, while most reduce the maximum level by 5&amp;nbsp;dB for pure tones and impulsive sounds.

====Motor Vehicle or Motorboat Repairs and Testing====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  If the activity is done in a residential zone, the Domestic Tools provision can be applied for the repairs, but this provision also is used for the testing phase of any repairs. Los Angeles, CA (Section 114.01) covers this violation in three ways.  The first is application of the ''noise disturbance'' provision in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The second is being ''plainly audible'' at a distance of 150 feet or more in residential districts between the hours of 8 pm to 8 am.  The third is exceeding the presumed ambient by 5&amp;nbsp;dB.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.7) prohibits this activity as a ''noise disturbance'' at any time.

====Noise Disturbance Prohibited====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. This provision is generic in that it covers all events that are considered disturbing by a listener, with or without measurement.  The strength of this provision is that it covers situations not contemplated in a noise ordinance and can be used as backup for more specific provisions. The weakness is that it may not give ''fair warning'', may lead to arbitrary enforcement on the part of the regulator, or permit unreasonable demands by a listener.

====Noise Sensitive Zones====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control.  It is used to reduce levels of both stationary and vehicular sound sources around hospitals, schools, and other noise sensitive locations.  To provide ''fair warning'' visible signs must be posted.  It is possible to have an extensive list. For example, if churches are on the list and the community has many of them, signage, compliance, and enforcement can be a problem. In modern hospital environments, helicopter sound is exempt.

====Places of Public Entertainment====
This provision is an ''objective immision '' control.  It regulates the site of the sound source while the Sound Reproduction Devices section regulates the devices that create the sound.  It can regulate the sound levels received by ''involuntary'' listeners in the surrounding community as well as the sound levels received by ''voluntary'' listeners.  If the latter aspect is incorporated, limiting internal sound levels often resolves community noise impact. Los Angeles (Article 2, Section 112.06)requires warning signs and limits noise exposure to 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at any position normally occupied. Seattle, WA {Section 25.08.501} considers the sound emitted to be in violation if the sound is ''plainly audible'' within a dwelling from 10 pm to 7am; the need for a sound level meter is avoided. Chicago, IL {Section 11-4-2805} limits received sound levels to 55&amp;nbsp;dB(A) inside a residential dwelling unit but if the ambient is greater, the limit is 65&amp;nbsp;dB(A).  If outdoors, the limit is ''conversational level'' at 100 feet from the property line.  If the building is set back 20 feet from the property line, the allowable level is 84&amp;nbsp;dB(A)!  Both of Chicago’s limits apply from 10 pm to 8 am.  Salt Lake health Department, UT {Section 4.5.11.(vii)} sets the limit at 95&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at a position that would normally be occupied by a patron and 100&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other positions. They also require a sign stating '''WARNING: SOUND LEVELS ON THIS PREMISE &amp;#91;sic&amp;#93; MAY CAUSE PERMANENT HEARING DAMAGE. HEARING PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE'''.   Anchorage, AK (Section 15.70.060.B.12) sets maximum levels for any patron at 90&amp;nbsp;dB(A).

====Powered Unmanned Vehicles or Engines====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew.  It has been used to regulate the sound of model aircraft on both private and public property.  It applies to airborne, water-borne, and land-borne, unmanned vehicles.  It makes no distinction between model vehicles and full-size unmanned vehicles.  it applies also to the engines of those vehicles. Most regulations pertained to private unmanned vehicles, normally restricted to local open fields.  The development of drones with microphones, cameras and GPS has opened the door to commercial use over wider private and public properties.  Since federal preemption of drone use will likely occur, it is important for this provision to make the distinction. Salt Lake Health Department (Section 4.5.15) limits activity to 800 feet from a dwelling between 10 pm and 7 am, or if it cases a noise disturbance. Atlanta, GA (Section 74-136(b)) uses the ''plainly audible'' criterion across a residential property line, on a public property from 10 pm to 7 am on weekdays or from 10 pm to 10 am on weekends or holidays for any sound source.

====Propane Cannons====
This provision is a subjective immission control with a curfew. A propane cannon is used to keep animals and birds from destroying commercial crops.  In large fields, many are used and fired as frequent intervals. The sound levels are equivalent to the firing of a small artillery cannon.  The provision may contain requirements that limit the number of cannons permitted in a specific area and the number firings per hour for each cannon.  many states have a Right to Farm Act that limits nuisance litigation.  Florida() stated that it was a purpose of their act to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on farm land from nuisance suits.  They also added a section that limited expand of operations without consideration of noise. Fairfax County, VA (Sections 105-4-4 and 108-5-1) require agricultural operation to meet maximum land use regulations and prohibit unnecessary noise.  British Columbia Ministry of Agriculture (Farm Nuisance Noise document) have developed a comprehensive set of rules for cannon use.

====Public Address Systems====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It can contain a ''plainly audible'' term or a curfew.  It is applied to commercial facilities using a sound system to ''deliberately'' propagate mostly speech, but also music.  Most cities have provisions relevant to this subject.  Lakewood, CO (Sections 9.52.06 and 09.52.160) used ''plainly audible'' as a regulatory tool and prohibits the sounding of bells, or chimes from 10pm to 7am.  Charlotte, NC (Section 15-69(a)(4)) limits levels to 60&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet from 9am to 9pm and 50&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at other times. Indianapolis, IN (Section 391-505) addresses broadcasts from aircraft. Connecticut (Section 22a-69-1.7) exempts bells, carillons, and chimes from religious facilities.

====Sound Reproduction Devices====
This provision is ''subjective immission'' control. It may contain a numerical level or a ''plainly audible'' term and a curfew. it is applied to specific sources of sound as opposed to any location at which the sound is created. It is applied primarily to ''amplified'' sound sources.  Older provisions listed several items such as televisions, phonographs, etc.  Changing the title to the above  addresses the real issue and allows for novel sound production devices.  Numerous communities have provisions for these devices; many use ''plainly audible'' as the criterion, such as Omaha, NE (Section 17-3) and Buffalo NY (Section 293-4)

====Stadiums and Outdoor Music Festivals====
This provision can be either a ''subjective or objective immission'' control with a curfew.  The subjective aspect relates to noise disturbance in the local community.  The objective aspect limits the acceptable sound level in the local community.  Illinois (Environmental Protection Act 415.25) exempts certain stadiums and exempts festivals, parades, or street fairs. Colorado Spring, CO (Section 9.8.101)  has similar exemptions, but limits the sound levels to 80&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at residential locations.

====Stationary Emergency Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control with a list of devices that are exempt. It can have a term that limits the time periods in which emergency alarms may be tested. It can have a term that limits the activation time of burglar or fire alarms.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2815) limits the time for tests to 4 minutes between 9am and 5pm. Oregon (Chapter 467) prohibits sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary.

====Stationary non-Emergency non-Safety Signaling Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control that limits the activation period of alarms and restricts activation to a specific time-of-day or day-of-week. Los Angeles, CA () prohibits the sounding if the signal can be heard at 200 feet or more. Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2820) considers the sound to be a noise disturbance in residential areas if the sound exceeds 5 minutes in any hour; steam whistles are exempt.  Albuquerque, NM (Section 9-9-12) restricts levels to 5&amp;nbsp;dB over the ambient at a property line and applies maximum permissible residential level as well as ''plainly audible'' restrictions at night.

====Street Sales====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. Boston, MA (Section 16-2.2) prohibits street sales near schools or churches if there is a “disturbance of the peace”.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.4) places a curfew between 6 pm and 9 am.

====Tampering====
This provision prevents the modification of muffling devices that increase the emitted sound. It can also be used to prevent the commercial sale of such mufflers.  Most states and communities have prohibitions on tampering with noise reduction devices. whether stationary or moving.  Salt Lake County health Department (Section 4.5.10) prohibits modifications of mufflers that increase sound levels and prohibits tampering with noise rating labels.  See Section below on Adequate Mufflers.

====Vibration====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control.  Noise disturbance caused by vibration comes in three forms.  One is contact with vibrating surfaces, the second in auditory, and the third is the observation of surrounding objects movement.  Objectively regulating vibration is difficult so this provision makes use of the Vibration Perception Threshold.  Railroad caused vibration is preempted by federal law (CFR 201). Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2910) uses the perception threshold method.   Dallas, TX requires measurement of low frequency vibration.  Maryland uses the definition of ''noise'' to include sound and vibration at sub-audible frequencies.

====Wind Turbines====
The sound created by wind turbines is caused by the blade rotation similar to aircraft propellers.  Because the rotation rate is low, the frequency is also low, but the large size of many can result in disturbing sound levels, particularly in high wind areas.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, A.L., Manwell, G.F., Wright, S. "Wind Turbine Acoustic Noise", University of Massachusetts at Amherst, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Most local control is done by advantageous site planning.  New Hampshire (Title LXIV, Section 674:63) sets a sound level limit of 55&amp;nbsp;dB when measured at the site property line, allowing for exceptional events, such as storms. Studies have declared that wind noise can have a negative effect on health.&lt;ref&gt;Anon, "Public Health Effects of Wind Turbines", Minnesota Department of Health, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ordinance Provisions for Moving Vehicles in the United States===
Stationary sources have fixed positions, so it is possible to define the listeners and therefore ''immission'' controls are appropriate.  Motor vehicles are moving sources so it is not possible to define any specific listeners so ''emission'' controls are appropriate.  There are exceptions to this distinction. Construction equipment, and some recreation vehicles, move within a bounded area and can be considered to be time varying fixed sources. Standing motor vehicles can radiate sufficient sound to create noise disturbance.  These must be treated by specific provisions.&lt;ref name="noisefree.org"/&gt;

====Adequate Mufflers or Sound Dissipation Devices====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control.  Unlike the Tampering provision, this is specific to motor vehicles.  It requires that a vehicle muffler not create more sound than the original equipment which has been measured.  It prohibits any modification or replacement that increases the sound emission beyond that of the original equipment. It prohibits the sale of mufflers that do not meet original equipment standards.  Many states have requirements that a muffler ''shall be in good working order'' which is not specific enough.  California (Section 27150.1)) requires that a retail seller that sells a product in violation of the muffler regulation  must install a replacement muffler that meets the regulation and must reimburse the purchaser for the expense of replacement.

====Airboats and Hovercraft====
This provision is both an "objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.  It can set a maximum sound level at a specified distance (typically 50 feet). It can have a curfew.  It can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in the community.  It can also require the use of ear protectors on passengers. Unlike motorboats, the sound generators on these vehicles are airborne, resulting in more noise impact.  Florida (Section 327.65) requires a maximum level of 90 DB(A).  Maine (Title 12 Section 13068-A)has three levels: operating, operating test and stationary test

====Engine Braking Devices====
This provision is an ''emission'' control. It can restrict brake use for only safety purposes and by defining restricted areas.  It can require that mufflers be maintained to keep emitted sound to that of the original equipment.  Common terminology is '''Jake brakes''' after the Jacobs Company. Milwaukee, Wi (Section 80-69) prohibits use within city limits.  Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.B.3) prohibits use within 200 feet of a residence.  Albuquerque, NM posts signs requiring proper mufflers.

====Motorboats====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control.
Because they are moving sources, ''objective'' controls are appropriate for measurements on open waterways.  Many motorboats operate in bounding areas, such as small lakes or canals, with adjacent residential areas.  In this case, ''immission'' controls are appropriate. California (Section 654.05), Portland OR (Section 18.10.040), and Seattle, WA (Section 25.08.485) require ''immission'' measurements to be made at the shoreline. Many states require ''emission'' measurements to be made at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Horns or Signaling Devices====
This provision is both a prohibition and an ''emission'' control. it limits to use for safety warning only..  It limits the sound level to a specific level at a prescribed distance.  This provision is intended to limit horn use to safety and to limit the use of excessively loud air horns or ''Rumbler'' or ''Howler'' horns. California prohibits a person operating a motor vehicle to wear a headset or earplugs on both ears. . Oregon (Section 820.370) prohibits signaling sound when an emergency vehicle is stationary or returning from an emergency

====Motor Vehicles on a Public Right-of-Way====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It applies maximum sound levels to various categories of moving vehicles and for several vehicle speeds.  It is the backbone of vehicle sound emission regulations. It generally requires a measurement of A-weighted sound level of a moving vehicle at a specific distance from the vehicle path (normally 50 feet).  This provision has level restrictions on trucks over 10,000 GVW used locally and in interstate commerce.  It also covers motorcycles of two horsepower ratings, mopeds, and all other vehicles on public rights-of-way.  The federal government has set maximum levels for heavy trucks used in interstate commerce (40 CFR 202)and for motorcycles (40 CFR 205).  Most states and many cities  have maximum limits and they generally agree with federal standards where they apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911031249/http://www.noisefree.org/Noise-Ordinance-Manual.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-11 |df= }} Appendix B&lt;/ref&gt; The most common speed division is 35&amp;nbsp;mph.

====Motor Vehicle Racing Events====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control. It can define the method of vehicle operation that is used to define the maximum permitted sound level.  It can have a curfew.  Some states exempt motor vehicle racing events from noise disturbance litigation or prosecution.  Arizona (Section 28-955.03) exempts racing motorcycles from maximum sound levels and muffler requirements. Illinois {Section 35.903} had detailed regulations on racing vehicles It required a 14&amp;nbsp;dB reduction in sound output, limited sound output at half mater to 115&amp;nbsp;dB(A), and no more than 105&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Sound systems====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control, a ''subjective emission'' control, and a ''subjective immission'' for vehicles on a public right-of-way.  The first part limits the system sound level at a fixed distance. The second part uses the ''plainly audible'' definition for limiting the sound output.  The third part uses the ''noise disturbance'' definition to limit the impact on neighboring properties and can be applied within public transportation. The most restrictive application of the plainly audible laws says that the sound cannot be audible to anyone other than the vehicle occupants.  There are numerous state and community restrictions on vehicle sound systems. Louisiana prohibits the system from emitting sound outside of a vehicle.  Richmond, CA also prohibits the sound from being audible outside the vehicle.  Oregon prohibits sound systems being ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet. California prohibits sound systems that can be ''heard'' at 50 feet. Colorado Springs, CO, requires a measurement at 25 feet beyond the private property line or 25 feet from the source on public property; it does not specify a limiting level.  In Lakewood, CO it must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 25 feet.  In Los Angeles, CA, it cannot be audible beyond 200 feet.  In Seattle, WA, it must not be ''plainly audible'' at 75 feet. Chicago restricts levels to less than ''clearly audible'' at 75 feet. Minneapolis, MN restricts levels to less than audible at 50 feet. Albuquerque, NM restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet, but also applies their land use limits.  Cincinnati, OH restricts ''plainly audible'' to 50 feet.  Dallas, TX prohibits sound or vibration that is detectable at 30 feet, or that violates the land use regulations.  Houston, TX applies land use restrictions. Omaha, NE states the sound must not be audible at 100 feet.  Hammond, IN restricts ''plainly audible'' to 25 feet. New Jersey states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 50 feet between 8 am and 10 pm and not ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet between 10 pm and 8 am.  Florida states the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' at 25 feet, but exempts business and political systems.  Oregon and Tennessee state that the sound must not be ''plainly audible'' beyond 50 feet, as does Fairbanks, AK. Rhode Island specifically addresses low frequency sound that can be heard 20 feet from a closed vehicle or 100 feet otherwise.  Salt Lake County Health Department, UT considers the sound a violation if it is ''plainly audible'' on a common carrier. Austin, TX states it must not be audible at 30 feet.

====Motor Vehicle Theft Alarms====
This provision is a ''subjective emission'' control with only an operational time limit. Los Angeles, CA () requires silencing in 5 minutes.  New York City, NY (Section 24.221(d)) requires automatic shut-off after 10 minutes and a prominent display of the local precinct number and telephone number.  Boston, MA (Section 16-26.2) considers it a violation if the alarm is plainly audible at 200 feet and is on more than 5 minutes.  Other states an communities have automatic shutoff times from 10 to 15 minutes.  Some communities have banned such alarms.

====Motor Vehicle Tire Squeal and Street Drag Racing====
This provision is  a ''subjective immission'' control. It is based on the ''noise disturbance'' from drag racing and tire squealing on public rights-of-way.  Illinois (625 ILCS 5/11-505) prohibits such activities.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.14) prohibits such activity if it creates a ''noise disturbance''.

====Railroads====
Railroad activity is subject to federal regulations. Most communities do not attempt to regulate train sound.  The level of train horns permitted by the Federal Railroad Administration sufficiently high that community impact occurs. One method to alleviate this sound is to have a community establish a '''quiet zone''' where the rail crossings meet federal safety standards so that horn use is not needed.

====Recreational Off-road Vehicles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance, is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate. Numerous states and cities have ''emission'' controls measured at 50 feet;  the most common level is 82&amp;nbsp;dB(A), which is similar to that for motor vehicles on public rights-of-way.  Colorado Springs, CO (Section 9.8.204.C) requires a minimum distance of 660 feet from residences. Portland, OR (Section 18.10.020.C) requires the area must be designated for recreational vehicle use.  Salt Lake health Department, UT (Section 4.5.10(x)) requires off-highway vehicles to be at least 800 feet from a dwelling during the day and has a curfew from 10 pm to 7 am.  They prohibit any ''noise disturbance'' and require sound levels to the less than 96&amp;nbsp;dB(A) at 50 feet.

====Recreational Snowmobiles====
This provision is both an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective immission'' control with a curfew. It can apply to both public and private properties.  Since these vehicles can move in large open areas, an ''objective'' control, limiting maximum sound levels at a fixed distance is appropriate.  Since they also can move in bounded areas near residences, a ''subjective'' control is appropriate.  Numerous states and communities have ''objective'' controls; the most common maximum level is 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A). Federal law (36 CFR 2.18) regulates snowmobiles on federal property at 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A), so states and communities are free to regulate snowmobile sound levels on their property. Lincoln NE (Section 8.24.110) limits levels to 78&amp;nbsp;dB(A).	Maine (Section 13112, Chapter 937) exempts snowmobiles at sanctioned racing events.  Illinois (625 ILCS 40 Sec. 4-4)does also.

====Refuse Collection Vehicles====
This provision is an ''objective emission'' control and a ''subjective'' control. It can place a maximum sound level at a specific distance for the loudest operation.  It can set a curfew, or it can be based on ''noise disturbance'' in residential zones. Los Angeles, CA (Section 113.01) has a time limit that applies only within 200 feet of any residential building.  Chicago, IL (Section 11-4-2900) considers any noise it a noise disturbance if the activity occurs between 8pm to 8am.  Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.6) considers it a noise disturbance if the activities occur between 10 pm to 7 am and closer than 800 feet from a dwelling.   Atlanta, GA (Section 74-137(a)(5)prohibits collection between 9pm and am on a weekend day or legal holiday, except by permit. In Maryland, refuse collection is exempt during daytime hours and must meet maximum land use levels [55&amp;nbsp;dB(A)] in residential zones at  night.

====Standing Motor Vehicles====
This provision is a ''subjective immission'' control. It sets a time limit on engine activity. It can also place a curfew on any engine activity. e. In Salt Lake City, UT (Section 4.5.10(xi)) it is considered a ''noise disturbance'' if the operation lasts more than 15 minutes.  Dallas, TX (Section 30-3.1) applies the code to vehicles over 14,000 GVWR; they must be more than 300 feet from a residential zone and there is a 10-minute maximum.  They also provide a list of idling vehicles that are exempt from prosecution such as buses or active concrete trucks.  Hammond, IN (Section 6.2.10) limits operation to 3 minutes in an hour for vehicles over 14,000 GVWR in either public or private property. It exempts buses and taxis. Massachusetts allows idling no more than 5 minutes.

==Building codes==
In the case of construction of new (or remodeled) apartments, condominiums, hospitals and hotels, many U.S. states and cities have stringent [[building code]]s with requirements of acoustical analysis, in order to protect building occupants from exterior noise sources and sound generated within the building itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Noise Control Manual for Residential Buildings |last=Harris |first=David A. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1997 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York |isbn=978-0-07-026942-2 |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to exterior noise, the codes usually require measurement of the exterior acoustic environment in order to determine the performance standard required for exterior building skin design.

The architect can work with the acoustical scientist to arrive at the best cost-effective means of creating a quiet interior (normally 45 [[decibel|dB]]).  The most important elements of design of the building skin are usually: [[insulated glazing|glazing]] (glass thickness, double pane design, etc.), roof material, caulking standards, chimney baffles, exterior door design, mail slots, attic ventilation ports and mounting of through the wall air conditioners.  A special case of building skin design arises in the case of [[aircraft noise]], where the FAA has funded extensive work in residential retrofit.

Regarding sound generated inside the building, there are two principal types of transmission. First, airborne sound travels through walls or floor/ceiling assemblies and can emanate from either human activities in adjacent living spaces or from mechanical noise within the building systems.  Human activities might include voice, amplified sound systems or  animal noise.  Mechanical systems are elevator systems, [[boiler]]s, [[refrigeration]] or [[air conditioning]] systems, [[Electrical generator|generator]]s and trash compactors.  Since many of these sounds are inherently loud, the principle of regulation is to require the wall or ceiling assembly to meet certain performance standards (typically Sound Transmission Class of 50), which allows considerable attenuation of the sound level reaching occupants.

The second type of interior sound is called [[Impact insulation class|Impact Insulation Class]] (IIC) transmission.  This effect arises not from airborne transmission, but rather from transmission of sound through the building itself.  The most common perception of IIC noise is from footfall of occupants in living spaces above.  This type of noise is somewhat more difficult to abate, but consideration must be given to isolating the floor assembly above or hanging the lower ceiling on resilient channel.  Commonly a performance standard of IIC equal to 50 is specified in building codes.  California has generally led the U.S. in widespread application of building code requirements for sound transmission; accordingly, the level of protection for building occupants has increased markedly in the last several decades.

==U.S. occupational safety regulations==
The U.S. [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] has established maximum noise levels for occupational exposure, beyond which mitigation measures or [[personal protective equipment]] is required.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Washington, D.C. [http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=standards&amp;p_id=9735 "Occupational noise exposure."] ''Code of Federal Regulations,'' {{CodeFedReg|29|1910|95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In recent years, [[Buy Quiet]] programs and initiatives have arisen in an effort to combat occupational noise exposures. These programs promote the purchase of quieter tools and equipment and encourage manufacturers to design quieter equipment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/buyquiet/default.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technology==

[[Image:Optical mapping.jpg|thumb|500px|right|alt=The optical mapping workflow.|The optical mapping workflow.]]
The modern optical mapping platform works as follows:&lt;ref name=OM_Platform&gt;Dimalanta, E.T. ''et al.'' A microfluidic system for large DNA molecule arrays. Anal. Chem. 76 (2004): 5293–5301.&lt;/ref&gt;
#Genomic DNA is obtained from lysed cells, and randomly sheared to produce a "library" of large genomic molecules for optical mapping.
#A single molecule of DNA is stretched (or elongated) and held in place on a slide under a fluorescent microscope due to charge interactions.
#The DNA molecule is digested by added restriction enzymes, which cleave at specific digestion sites. The resulting molecule fragments remain attached to the surface. The fragment ends at the cleavage sites are drawn back (due to elasticity of linearized DNA), leaving gaps which are identifiable under the microscope.
#DNA fragments stained with intercalating dye are visualized by fluorescence microscopy and are sized by measuring the integrated fluorescence intensity. This produces an optical map of single molecules.
#Individual optical maps are combined to produce a consensus, genomic optical map.

==History of optical mapping platform==

===Early system===

DNA molecules were fixed on molten agarose developed between a cover slip and a microscope slide. Restriction enzyme was pre-mixed with the molten agarose before DNA placement and cleavage was triggered by addition of magnesium.

===Using charged surfaces===

Rather than being immobilized within a gel matrix, DNA molecules were held in place by electrostatic interactions on a positively charged surface. Resolution improved such that fragments from ~30kb to as small as 800bp could sized.

===Automated system===

This involved the development and integration of an automated spotting system to spot multiple single molecules on a slide (like a microarray) for parallel enzymatic processing, automated fluorescence microscopy for image acquisition, image procession vision to handle images, algorithms for optical map construction, cluster computing for processing large amounts of data

===High-throughput system using microfluidics===

Observing that microarrays spotted with single molecules did not work well for large genomic DNA molecules, [[microfluidic]] devices using soft lithography possessing a series of parallel microchannels were developed.

===Next-generation system using nanocoding technology===

An improvement on optical mapping, called "Nanocoding",&lt;ref name=Nanocoding&gt;Jo, K., et al. "A Single-Molecule Barcoding System using Nanoslits for DNA Analysis." Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America 104.8 (2007): 2673–8.&lt;/ref&gt; has potential to boost throughput by trapping elongated DNA molecules in nanoconfinements.

==Comparisons==

===Other mapping techniques===
The advantage of OM over traditional mapping techniques is that it preserves the order of the DNA fragment, whereas the order needs to be reconstructed using [[restriction mapping]]. In addition, since maps are constructed directly from genomic DNA molecules, cloning or PCR artifacts are avoided. However, each OM process is still affected by false positive and negative sites because not all restriction sites are cleaved in each molecule and some sites may be incorrectly cut. In practice, multiple optical maps are created from molecules of the same genomic region, and an algorithm is used to determine the best consensus map.&lt;ref name=Algorithm&gt;Valouev, A., Schwartz, D., Zhou, S., and Waterman, M.S. "An algorithm for assembly of ordered restriction maps from single DNA molecules." RECOMB '98: Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America  103 (2006): 15770–15775.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other genome analysis methods===
There are a variety of approaches to identifying large-scale genomic variations (such as indels, duplications, inversions, translocations) between genomes. Other categories of methods include using [[DNA microarrays|microarrays]], [[Pulsed field gel electrophoresis|pulsed-field gel electrophoresis]], [[cytogenetics]] and [[paired-end tag]]s.

==Uses==
Initially, the optical mapping system has been used to construct whole-genome restriction maps of bacteria, parasites, and fungi.&lt;ref&gt;Lai, Z., et al. "A Shotgun Optical Map of the Entire Plasmodium Falciparum Genome." Nature genetics 23.3 (1999): 309–13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lim, A., et al. "Shotgun Optical Maps of the Whole Escherichia Coli O157:H7 Genome." Genome research 11.9 (2001): 1584-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lin, J., et al. "Whole-Genome Shotgun Optical Mapping of Deinococcus Radiodurans." Science 285.5433 (1999): 1558–62.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to scaffold and validate bacterial genomes.&lt;ref&gt;Nagarajan, N., et al. "Scaffolding and validation of bacterial genome assemblies using optical restriction maps." Bioinformatics 24.10 (2008):1229–35.&lt;/ref&gt; To serve as scaffolds for assembly, assembled sequence contigs can be scanned for restriction sites ''in silico'' using known sequence data and aligning them to the assembled genomic optical map. Commercial company, Opgen has provided optical mappings for microbial genomes. For larger eukaryotic genomes, only the David C. Schwartz lab (now at Madison-Wisconsin) has produced optical maps for mouse,&lt;ref&gt;Church, D.M. ''et al.'' Lineage-specific biology revealed by a finished genome assembly of the mouse. PLoS Biology, 7.5 (2009):e1000112.&lt;/ref&gt; human,&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, J.M. ''et al.'' Mapping and sequencing of structural variation from eight human genomes. Nature 453 (2008): 56–64.&lt;/ref&gt; rice,&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, S. ''et al.''Validation of rice genome sequence by Optical Mapping. BMC Genomics 8 (2007): 278.&lt;/ref&gt; and maize.&lt;ref&gt;Zhou, S. ''et al.'' A single molecule scaffold for the maize genome. PLoS Genetics, 5.11(2009): epub.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optical sequencing==

'''Optical sequencing''' is a single molecule DNA sequencing technique that follows sequence-by-synthesis  and uses optical mapping technology.&lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan, A., et al. "An Integrative Approach for the Optical Sequencing of Single DNA Molecules." Analytical Biochemistry 330.2 (2004): 227–41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramanathan, A., Paper, L., and Schwartz, D.C. "High-Density Polymerase-Mediated Incorporation of Fluorochrome-Labeled Nucleotides." Analytical Biochemistry 337.1 (2005): 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar to other single molecular sequencing approaches such as [[SMRT sequencing]], this technique analyzes a single DNA molecule, rather than amplify the initial sample and sequence multiple copies of the DNA.  During synthesis, fluorochrome-labeled nucleotides are incorporated through the use of DNA polymerases and tracked by [[fluorescence microscopy]].  This technique was originally proposed by David C. Schwartz and Arvind Ramanathan in 2003.

===Optical sequencing cycle===
The following is an overview of each cycle in the optical sequencing process.&lt;ref name="NGS_towards_personalized_medicine"&gt;Zhou, S., Paper, L., and Schwartz, D.C. "Optical Sequencing: Acquisition from Mapped Single-Molecule Templates." Next-Generation Genome Sequencing: Towards Personalized Medicine. Ed. Michal Janitz. 1st ed. Wiley-VCH, 2008. 133–151.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Optical cycle.jpg|thumb|400px|right|alt=The optical sequencing cycle.|The optical sequencing cycle.]]

'''Step 1: DNA barcoding'''&lt;br /&gt;
Cells are lysed to release genomic DNA.  These DNA molecules are untangled, placed onto optical mapping surface containing microfluidic channels and the DNA is allowed to flow through the channels.  These molecules are then barcoded by restriction enzymes to allow for genomic localization through the technique of optical mapping.  See the above section on [[#Technology|"Technology"]] for those steps.

'''Step 2: Template nicking'''&lt;br /&gt;
DNase I is added to randomly nick the mounted DNA molecules.  A wash is then performed to remove the DNase I.  The mean number of nicks that occur per template is dependent on the concentration of DNase I as well as the incubation time.

'''Step 3: Gap formation'''&lt;br /&gt;
T7 exonuclease is added which uses the nicks in the DNA molecules to expand the gaps in a 5'–3' direction. Amount of T7 exonuclease must be carefully controlled to avoid overly high levels of double-stranded breaks.

'''Step 4: Fluorochrome incorporation'''&lt;br /&gt;
DNA polymerase is used to incorporate fluorochrome-labelled nucleotides (FdNTPs) into the multiple gapped sites along each DNA molecule.  During each cycle, the reaction mixture contains a single type of FdNTP and allows for multiple additions of that nucleotide type.  Various washes are then performed to remove unincorporated fdNTPs in preparation for imaging and the next cycle of FdNTP addition.

'''Step 5: Imaging'''&lt;br /&gt;
This step counts the number of incorporated fluorochrome-labeled nucleotides at the gap regions using fluorescence microscopy.

'''Step 6: Photobleaching'''&lt;br /&gt;
The laser illumination that is used to excite the fluorochrome is also used here to destroy the fluorochrome signal.  This essentially resets the fluorochrome counter, and prepares the counter for the next cycle.  This step is a unique aspect of optical sequencing as it does not actually remove the fluorochrome label of the nucleotide after its incorporation. not removing the fluorochrome label makes sequencing more economical, but it results in the need to incorporate fluorochrome labels consecutively which can result in problems due to the bulkiness of the labels.

'''Step 7: Repeat steps 4–6'''&lt;br /&gt;
Steps 4-6 are repeated with step 4 using a reaction mixture that contains a different fluorochrome-labeled nucleotide (FdNTP) each time.  This is repeated until the desired region is sequenced.

===Optimization strategies===
Selection of an appropriate DNA polymerase is critical to the efficiency of the base addition step and must meet several criteria:
* Ability to efficiently incorporate FdNTP at consecutive positions
* Lack of 3'–5' exonuclease and proofreading activity to prevent the removal newly incorporated FdNTP
* High fidelity to minimize mis-incorporations
* Good activity on templates which are mounted to surfaces (e.g. optical mapping surface)

In addition, different polymerase preference for different fluorochromes, linker length on fluorochrome-nucleotides, and buffer compositions are also important factors to be considered to optimize the base addition process and maximize number of consecutive FdNTP incorporations.

===Advantages===
'''Single-molecule analysis'''&lt;br /&gt;
Since minimal DNA sample required, time-consuming and costly amplification step is avoided to streamline sample preparation process.

'''Large DNA molecule templates (~500 kb) vs. Short DNA molecule templates (&lt; 1kb)'''
While most next generation sequencing technologies aim of massive amounts of smalls sequence reads, these small sequence reads make de novo sequencing efforts and genome repeat regions difficult to comprehend.  Optical sequencing uses large DNA molecule templates (~500 kb) for sequencing and these offer several advantages over small templates:

#These large DNA templates can be "DNA barcoded" to determine their genomic localization with confidence. Therefore, any sequence reads that are taken from the large template can be mapped onto the genome with a high degree of confidence.  More importantly, sequence reads from high repeat regions can placed with a greater degree of confidence whereas the short reads suffer from mapping  uncertainty in high repeat regions.  Special algorithms and software such as optical mapping and nanocoding have been developed to align single-molecule barcodes with a reference genome.
#Multiple sequence reads from the same large template molecule. These multiple sequence reads reduce the complexity of de novo assembly, disambiguate genomic rearrangement regions, and "intrinsically free from any assembly errors."&lt;ref name="NGS_towards_personalized_medicine" /&gt;
#Molecular barcoding of large DNA molecular templates with sequence acquisition provides broad and specific genomic analyses

===Disadvantages===
* Single molecule DNA sequencing requires a high level of precision to match the confidence from the redundant read coverage provided by current next-generation sequencing technologies.
* Nicks on both strands at similar positions resulting in low template during sequence-by-synthesis.
* Fluorochrome-labeled nucleotides are not removed after incorporation and because of these bulky labels, multiple incorporation might be difficult.

In [[computer graphics]], '''planar''' is the method of representing [[pixel]] colors with several ''[[bit plane|bitplanes]]'' of [[Random Access Memory|RAM]]. Each bit in a bitplane is related to one pixel on the screen. Unlike [[Packed pixel|chunky]], [[high color]], or [[Color depth#True color (24-bit) | true color]] graphics, the whole dataset for an individual pixel isn't in one specific location in RAM, but spread across the bitplanes that make up the display.

This scheme originated in the early days of computer graphics. The memory [[Integrated circuit|chips]] of this era can not supply data fast enough on their own to generate a picture on a TV screen or monitor from a large [[framebuffer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | year = 1985
 | page = 13
 | isbn = 0-07-053534-5 
}}&lt;/ref&gt; By splitting the data up into multiple planes, each plane can be stored on a separate memory chip. These chips can then be read in parallel at a slower rate, allowing graphical display on modest hardware. The [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]] video adapter on early [[IBM PC]] computers uses planar arrangement in color graphical modes for this reason. The later [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] includes [[Mode 13h|one non-planar mode]] which sacrifices memory efficiency for more convenient access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.osdev.org/VGA_Hardware|title=VGA Hardware - OSDev Wiki|website=wiki.osdev.org|accessdate=September 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Diagram of planar computer graphics.svg|thumb|Combining four one-bit planes into a final "four bits per pixel" (16-color) image]]
For example, on a [[Packed pixel|chunky]] display, each byte represents one pixel. Three pixels in a row are stored as follows, where up to 256 different colors are available:

{|class="wikitable"
! Byte index || 0 || 1 || 2
|-
| Value (binary) || 00000000 || 00000001 || 00000010
|-
| Value (decimal) || 0 || 1 || 2
|-
| Resulting pixel
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| Black
|style="background-color: #0000A8; color: white;"| Blue
|style="background-color: #00A800; color: white;"| Green
|}

Whereas a planar data store could use 2 bitplanes, providing for a 4 color display:

{|class="wikitable"
! Byte index ||colspan=8| 0
|-
! Bit index || 0 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7
|-
| Plane 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| Plane 1 || 0 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0 || 0 || 1 || 0
|-
| Resulting pixel
|style="background-color: #0000A8; color: white;"| 1
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #00A800; color: white;"| 2
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|style="background-color: #00A8A8; color: white;"| 3
|style="background-color: #000000; color: white;"| 0
|-
| Byte value ||colspan=8 style="text-align: center;"| 146
|}

Adding a third plane makes 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;=8 colors available. Where fewer than 256 colors are needed, planar graphics are more economical in RAM compared with 8-bit chunky graphics, as there are no unused bits in a given byte.

A disadvantage of planar graphics is that more RAM address cycles are needed for [[scrolling]] and [[animation]]s, although these operations can be made faster by dedicated hardware such as the [[blitter]] chips used in [[Amiga]] and some later [[Atari ST]] computers.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

'''Plant identification''' is the process of matching a specimen plant to a known [[taxon]].  It uses various methods, most commonly [[dichotomous key]]s or [[multi-access key]]s.

==History==
{{see also|History of botany|History of plant systematics}}   
[[File:GeorgeBentham.jpg|thumb|upright|[[George Bentham]] English systematician and botanist]]
Plant identification has evolved over hundreds of years and depends to a large extent on what criteria and whose system is used. Plant identification implies comparisons of certain characteristics and then assigning a particular plant to a known taxonomic group, ultimately arriving at a species or [[infraspecific name]].

In the history of botany many large systems, useful at the time, were widely used for decades until superseded as taxonomic knowledge progressed.
*''Genera Plantarum''&lt;ref&gt;Isely, Duane. 1994 ''One hundred and one botanists'' Iowa State University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was devised by [[George Bentham]] (1800–1884) and [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]] (1817–1911) who were British botanists working for [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] in the latter part of the nineteenth century. They described the system in a three-volume work. A total of 202 groups were described, which they called "orders" - now known as families. The system was renowned for being very practical and the keys were quite accurate.

The study by of plant taxonomy with [[computer programme]]s was beginning by the early 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/1218086 |title=Computer-Assisted Storage and Retrieval of the Data of Taxonomy and Systematics |author=Larry E. Morse |journal=Taxon |volume=23 |issue=1 |year=1974 |pages=29–43 |doi=10.2307/1218086}}&lt;/ref&gt; and botanical keys now use numerical computer systems.  &lt;!--The plant identification key was deleted on request--&gt;

==Taxonomy==
This is the branch of botany which deals with plant identification, nomenclature and classification. The term, first coined by French botanist A. P. de Candolle (1813). [[Carl Linnaeus]] used the term 'Systematics' which now includes identification, nomenclature and evolutionary relationships.

==Herbarium==
{{Main|Herbarium}}
Reference collections of plant specimens are collected into herbarium and identified. Most plant parts are dried, pressed, mounted on herbarium sheets and stored; succulents and some other types of plants are normally kept in alcohol solution. The sheets are standard size of 16{{fraction|1|2}}  × 11{{fraction|1|2}} inches or 41.25 × 28.75&amp;nbsp;cm. The identified plant ideally includes all parts including roots, flowers and fruits, strobili, etc. One of the largest herbaria in the world is kept at the [[Kew Gardens|Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] England and has collected an estimated 7 Million specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://sweetgum.nybg.org/ih/herbarium.php?irn=125812 |title=Index Herbariorum |entry=entry for RBG Kew |accessdate=21 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is used commercially as a form of [[waste treatment]] and has been tested for the gasification of [[municipal solid waste]], [[biomass]], [[industrial waste]], [[hazardous waste]], and solid [[hydrocarbons]], such as [[coal]], [[oil sands]], [[Petroleum coke|petcoke]] and [[oil shale]].&lt;ref name=kalinenko/&gt;

== Process ==
Small plasma torches typically use an [[inert gas]] such as [[argon]] where larger torches require [[nitrogen]]. The [[electrode]]s vary from [[copper]] or [[tungsten]] to [[hafnium]] or [[zirconium]], along with various other [[alloy]]s.  A strong electric current under high voltage passes between the two electrodes as an [[electric arc]]. Pressurized inert gas is [[Ionization|ionized]] passing through the plasma created by the arc. The torch's temperature ranges from {{convert|4000|to|25000|F|C|-2}}.&lt;ref name="recoveredenergy"&gt;

The waste is heated, melted and finally [[Vaporization|vaporized]]. Only at these extreme conditions can molecular [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] occur by breaking apart [[Covalent bond|molecular bonds]]. [[molecule|Complex molecules]] are separated into individual [[atoms]]. The resulting elemental components are in a gaseous phase ([[syngas]]). Molecular dissociation using plasma is referred to as "plasma [[pyrolysis]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Feedstocks ===
The feedstock for plasma waste treatment is most often [[municipal solid waste]], [[organic waste]], or both. Feedstocks may also include [[biomedical waste]] and [[Dangerous goods|hazmat]] materials.  Content and consistency of the waste directly impacts performance of a plasma facility. Pre-sorting and recycling useful material before gasification provides consistency. Too much inorganic material such as metal and construction waste increases slag production, which in turn decreases [[syngas]] production. However, a benefit is that the slag itself is chemically inert and safe to handle (certain materials may affect the content of the gas produced, however&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;). Shredding waste before entering the main chamber helps to increase syngas production. This creates an efficient transfer of energy which ensures more materials are broken down.&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/energy/plasma-converter.htm| title=How Stuff Works- Plasma Converter|accessdate=2012-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For improved processing steam is sometimes added into the plasma gasification process.

=== Yields ===

Pure highly calorific [[syngas|synthesis gas]] consists predominantly of [[carbon monoxide]] (CO) and [[hydrogen]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="synconversion"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; [[Inorganic compound]]s in the waste stream are not broken down but melted, which includes glass, ceramics, and various metals.

The high temperature and lack of oxygen prevents the formation of many toxic compounds such as [[furan]]s, [[dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], [[NOx|nitrogen oxides]], or [[sulfur dioxide]] in the flame itself. However, dioxins are formed during cooling of the syngas.

Metals resulting from plasma [[pyrolysis]] can be recovered from the slag and eventually sold as a commodity. Inert slag produced from some processes is granulated and can be used in construction.  A portion of the syngas produced feeds on-site turbines, which power the plasma torches and thus support the feed system. This is self-sustaining electric power.&lt;ref name="synconversion"/&gt;

* Operational costs are high relative to that of incineration.
* Little or even negative net energy production.
* Wet feed stock results in less syngas production and higher energy consumption.

The code of '''purity of arms''' ({{lang-he|טוהר הנשק}}, ''Tohar HaNeshek'') is one of the values stated in the [[Israel Defense Forces]]' official doctrine of ethics, ''The Spirit of the IDF''. It states that:

{{cquote|The soldier shall make use of his weaponry and power only for the fulfillment of the mission and solely to the extent required; he will maintain his humanity even in combat. The soldier shall not employ his weaponry and power in order to harm non-combatants or prisoners of war, and shall do all he can to avoid harming their lives, body, honor and property.|||IDF Spirit&lt;ref name="doctrine" /&gt;}}

==Jewish and universal moral sources of the code==

The "Spirit of the IDF", a text within the IDF's main doctrine, requires "honoring the values of the State of Israel as a Jewish ... state", referring to both "the tradition of the Jewish People throughout their history" and "universal moral values based on the value and dignity of human life".&lt;ref name="doctrine"/&gt; [[Halacha|Jewish religious law]] does not directly determine IDF policy, and the IDF Doctrine Statement is not a religious document, but its underlying religious basis was articulated by Chief Rabbi [[Shlomo Goren]] (1917–1994), who had served in the IDF as both paratrooper and chief chaplain.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; 

According to [[Norman Solomon (rabbi)|Rabbi Norman Solomon]], the concepts of [[Havlaga]] and purity of arms arise out of the ethical and moral values stemming from the tradition of Israel, extrapolation from the Jewish [[Halakha]], and the desire for moral approval and hence political support from the world community.&lt;ref name= "solomon"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Judaism and the ethics of war |author=[[Norman Solomon (rabbi)|Norman Solomon]] |journal=International Review of the Red Cross |volume=87 |number=858 |date=June 2005 |url=https://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/irrc_858_solomon.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite doubts when confronted by indiscriminate terrorism, purity of arms remains the guiding rule for the Israeli forces.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt; These foundations have elicited a fair degree of consensus among Jews, both religious and secular.&lt;ref name="solomon"/&gt;

A notable proponent of this image is Colonel [[Richard Kemp]], a retired British army officer, who called the IDF the most moral army in the world on Israel's Channel 2 News.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/Default.aspx?tabid%3D178%26nid%3D24780 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160513204717/http://www.israeltoday.co.il/Default.aspx?tabid=178&amp;nid=24780 |archivedate=May 13, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 document regarding Operation Protective Edge, published by [[Friends of Israel Initiative]], the High Level Military Group, composed of military experts from Australia, Colombia, France, Germany, India, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Spain, acknowledged that Israel made "unprecedented efforts" to avoid civilian casualties exceeding international standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.high-level-military-group.org/pdf/hlmg-assessment-2014-gaza-conflict.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161011145546/http://www.high-level-military-group.org/pdf/hlmg-assessment-2014-gaza-conflict.pdf |archivedate=October 11, 2016 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast, the 2015 report of the U.N. Human Rights Council on Operation Protective Edge, chaired by Mary McGowan Davis (ex-Justice of the Supreme Court of the State of New York), voiced concerns that "the fact that the political and military leadership did not change its course of action, despite considerable information regarding the massive degree of death and destruction in Gaza, raises questions about potential violations of international humanitarian law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report |author=Human Rights Council |date=23 June 2015 |title=Report of the detailed findings of the independent commission of inquiry established pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution S-21/1|publisher=United Nations|docket=A/HRC/29/CRP.4|access-date=14 June 2018 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tactical and ethical dilemmas==

In combat and other confrontation situations several of the values within the Spirit of the IDF code are concomitantly evoked, such as:
*Human Life: "The IDF servicemen and women will act in a judicious and safe manner in all they do, out of recognition of the supreme value of human life. During combat they will endanger themselves and their comrades only to the extent required to carry out their mission."&lt;ref name="doctrine" /&gt;
*Comradeship: "The IDF servicemen and women will act out of fraternity and devotion to their comrades, and will always go to their assistance when they need their help or depend on them, despite any danger or difficulty, even to the point of risking their lives."&lt;ref name="doctrine"&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctrine |publisher=Israel Defense Forces |url=http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=32 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430031938/http://www1.idf.il/dover/site/mainpage.asp?sl=EN&amp;id=32 |year=2006 |archivedate=April 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dealing with such dilemmas requires a coherent response on the part of officer and soldier alike.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Selective targeting (or [[targeted killing]]) of terrorist leaders is considered by the IDF as a legitimate mode of operation and part of a state's counterterrorism, anticipatory, self-defense activities that are designed to prevent the continuation of terrorism. Selective targeting of terrorist activists is used as a measure designed to hurt the real enemy while minimizing civilian casualties. The practice was challenged before the Israeli Supreme Court, which held that while terrorists were civilians under the law of armed conflict, they were not protected by the prohibition in Article 51(3) of Protocol I of the Geneva Conventions, which provides that civilians enjoy immunity from deliberate attack "unless and for such time as they take a direct part in hostilities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rule 6. Civilians’ Loss of Protection from Attack |publisher=ICRC |url=http://www.icrc.org/customary-ihl/eng/docs/v1_cha_chapter1_rule6 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court found that the meaning of both "for such time" and "direct part in hostilities" covered those providing services to unlawful combatants in any period before a potential attack; therefore terrorists did not qualify for this immunity, a ruling that has been accepted into international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nils Melzer |title=Interpretive Guidance on the Notion of Direct Participation in Hostilities Under International Humanitarian Law |url=http://www.icrc.org/eng/assets/files/other/icrc-002-0990.pdf |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision received a mixed reception from the international community, with one scholar expressing concern that it threatened "to undermine international law's protection of civilians in armed conflict by shifting the balance toward military advantage and increasing the likelihood of collateral damage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kristen Eichensehr |title=On Target?

== Criticism ==

Some challenge the idea that the IDF is either particularly moral or follows the concept of "Purity of Arms",&lt;ref name="Prior1999p208"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Michael Prior]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAFJVy6GPHkC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22Purity+of+arms%22 |title=The state of Israel: A Moral Inquiry |chapter=Purity of Arms |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1999 |page=208 |isbn=9780203980217 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Avneri2007p31"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Uri Avneri]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OLUDrlB2ui8C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22arm%C3%A9e+la+plus+morale+du+monde%22 |title=Guerre du Liban, un Israélien accuse |publisher=[[L'Harmattan]] |year=2007 |page=31 |isbn=9782296023413 |others=Roland Massuard and Sylviane de Wangen, translators; Sylviane de Wangen, contributor}}&lt;/ref&gt; but according to [[Gideon Levy]], the "majority of the Israelis is still deeply convinced that their army, the IDF, is the most moral army of the world, and nothing else".&lt;ref name ="GL"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="Prior1999p208"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Avneri2007p31"/&gt; Criticism of the concept has centered on its consistency with international law, and the tendency for civilians to be killed in the process.&lt;ref&gt;By the end of 2005, almost 300 terrorist organization members and 150 civilian bystanders had been killed in targeted killings, in addition to hundreds of civilians wounded. See HCJ 769/02 Pub. Comm. Against Torture in Isr. v. Gov't of Isr. (PCAT1) [December 11, 2005] slip op. para. 2, available at http://elyon.court.gov.il/FilesENG/o2/69o/oo7/a34/ 0200769o.a34.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2015}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Certain actions that have marked the army's history are at the origins of the criticism. Among these are massacres that took place during the [[1948 Palestine war|1948 War]],&lt;ref&gt;See section "Purity of Arms" in the articles about the [[Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine War]].&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Qibya massacre|Qibya]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Noam Chomsky]] |title=The Fateful Triangle: the United States, Israel and the Palestinians |year=1989 |pages=383–85 |publisher=Pluto Press |edition=2nd New |isbn=978-0745315355}} &lt;!-- date was listed as 1988; first edition was 1983 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Kafr Qasim massacre|Kafr Qasim]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Tom Segev]] |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/opinion/apology-in-kafr-qasem-1.235964 |title=Apology in Kafr Qasem |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=December 26, 2007 |quote=The Kafr Qasem massacre shocked the country and gave rise to a public debate on basic questions of morality and democracy. |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; against prisoners of war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Michael Prior]] |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gAFJVy6GPHkC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=%22Purity+of+arms%22 |title=The state of Israel: A Moral Inquiry |chapter=Purity of Arms |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1999 |page=209 |isbn=9780203980217 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}} reports the controversy published in ''[[Maariv]]'' in 1995 about the assassinations in 1956 of 140 Egyptian prisoners of war including 49 workers by the fighters of the 890th brigade under the orders of [[Rafael Eitan]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encel-Thual-403"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Frédéric Encel]] |author2=François Thual |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=udIuAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22puret%E9+des+armes%22&amp;dq=%22puret%E9+des+armes%22 |title=Géopolitique d'Israël] |language=fr |year=2004 |page=403 |isbn=978-2020638203 |quote=[...] the execution of Egyptian prisonners during the Suez campaign (1956) [as well as other events] prove that 'Purity of Arms' [...] in Israel as elsewhere is a myth. |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Sabra and Shatila massacre|Sabra and Shatila]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Noam Chomsky]] |title=The Fateful Triangle: the United States, Israel and the Palestinians |year=1989 |pages=259–60 |publisher=Pluto Press |edition=2nd New |isbn=978-0745315355}} doubts of the "morality" of the IDF as well as well as those who defend it in the context of Sabra et Shatila.&lt;/ref&gt; or at [[1996 shelling of Qana|Qana]].&lt;ref name="Encel-Thual-403" /&gt; To these may be added controversial operations such as the [[Battle of Jenin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Joss Dray]] |author2=Denis Sieffert |author-link2=:fr:Denis Sieffert |title=La guerre israélienne de l'information |publisher=La Découverte |year=2002 |pages=103–06 |language=fr |isbn=9782707138392}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Operation Cast Lead]],&lt;ref name="GL"&gt;[[Gideon Levy]], ''[http://www.grotius.fr/node/406 Israël, Goldstone et tout le reste...] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100627072825/http://www.grotius.fr/node/406 |date=June 27, 2010 }}'' writes "Israel committed war crimes during Opereation Cast Lead at Gaza.

According to [[Avi Shlaim]], "purity of arms" is one of the key features of "the conventional Zionist account or old history" whose "popular-heroic-moralistic version of the 1948 war" is "taught in Israeli schools and used extensively in the quest for legitimacy abroad".&lt;ref name="shlaimdebate"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Avi Shlaim]] |url=http://www.press.umich.edu/pdf/9780472115419-ch5.pdf |chapter=The Debate About 1948 |title=Making Israel |accessdate=March 5, 2015}} Also published in {{cite journal |title= The Debate About 1948 |journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies |volume=27 |issue=3 |year=1995 |pages=287–304 |doi=10.1017/s0020743800062097}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benny Morris]] adds, "[t]he Israelis' collective memory of fighters characterized by "purity of arms" is also undermined by the evidence of [the dozen case] of rapes committed in conquered towns and villages." According to him, "after the war, the Israelis tended to hail the "purity of arms" of its militiamen and soldiers to contrast this with Arab barbarism, which on occasion expressed itself in the mutilation of captured Jewish corpses. (...) This reinforced the [[Hasbara|Israelis' positive self-image and helped them 'sell' the new state abroad]] and (...) demonized the enemy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Benny Morris]] |title=1948.

Following the [[Qibya massacre]], [[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] questioned the moral character of operations of the Israeli army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Yeshayahu Leibowitz]] |title=After Qibya |journal=BeTerem |date=December 15, 1953 |pages=168–73}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that at the contrary of the time of diaspora, Jews established in Israel have the possibility to resort to force and that if in 1948 they had no choice, at Qibya the Israeli nation showed his moral limits.&lt;ref name = "MorrisQibya"&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Benny Morris]] |title=The Israeli Press and the Qibya Operation, 1953 |year=1996 |page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israeli Colonel Dov Yirmiah has referred to "the lies about humanitarianism and 'purity of arms'", and refers to purity of arms as a phrase that is "sickening and false".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Noam Chomsky]] |title=The Fateful Triangle: the United States, Israel and the Palestinians |year=1989 |publisher=Pluto Press |edition=2nd New |isbn=978-0745315355}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dov's book ''My War Diary: Lebanon June 5 – July 1, 1982'' has been described as having "crushed the myth" of the purity of arms of the IDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Embracing the Other: Philosophical, Psychological, and Historical Perspectives on Altruism |author=Pearl Oliner |author2=Samuel P.

According to [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]] the claim that the IDF is the most moral army in the world is "yet another myth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[John Mearsheimer]] |author2=[[Stephen Walt]] |title=The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy |publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux |date=2008 |isbn=978-0374531508}}{{page needed|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A former head of the Mossad, Zvi Zamir stated that the fact that Israel Defense Forces soldiers have shot at unarmed people on the Syrian–Israeli border showed the IDF's "purity of arms" was being eroded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Gili Izikovich	|date=June 10, 2011 |title=IDF's 'purity of arms' being eroded, former Mossad chief Zvi Zamir warns |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/idf-s-purity-of-arms-being-eroded-former-mossad-chief-zvi-zamir-warns-1.366856 |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting Rabbinic opinion===

Some rabbis oppose the stipulation of avoiding harm to non-combatants, arguing that Jewish law specifically rejects this requirement during wartime. Some instances:
* Rabbis associated with the Israeli settlement movement in the West Bank and Gaza demanded in 2004 that terrorism must be fought without regard for the safety of the enemy civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |date=September 9, 2004 |url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4561_62.htm |title=ADL Strongly Condemns Declaration of Rabbis |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |accessdate=March 5, 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002221043/http://www.adl.org/PresRele/IslME_62/4561_62.htm |archivedate=October 2, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], the main organization of Modern Orthodox rabbis in the United States called on the Israeli military to be less concerned with avoiding civilian casualties on the opposing side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rebecca Spence |title=Rabbis: Israel Too Worried Over Civilian Deaths |newspaper=The Jewish Daily Forward |date=August 25, 2006 |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/1438/ |accessdate=March 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that [[Hezbollah]] hides among the civilian population, and therefore it would be immoral not to attack Hezbollah—as Hezbollah poses an extreme threat to the Israeli civilian population.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21102">The '''rabbinical translations of Matthew''' are rabbinical versions of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] that are written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; ''Shem-Tob's Matthew'', the ''Du Tillet Matthew'', and the ''Münster Matthew'', and which were used in polemical debate with Catholics.

These versions are to be distinguished from the [[Gospel of the Hebrews]] which was one or more works found in the [[Early Church]], but surviving only as fragmentary quotations in Greek and Latin texts.

Some scholars consider all the rabbinical versions to be translated from the Greek or Latin of the canonical Matthew, for the purpose of Jewish apologetics.&lt;ref&gt;Brown&lt;/ref&gt;  This conclusion is not exclusive.  Other scholars have provided linguistic and historic evidence of Shem Tov's Matthew coming from a much earlier Hebrew text that was later translated into Greek and other languages.  Early Christian author Papias wrote around the year 100 that,  "Matthew composed his history in the Hebrew dialect, and everyone translated it as he was able".&lt;ref&gt;Gordon&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Howard&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rabbinical Jewish versions==
===Early Rabbinical citations of Matthew, 600-1300===
Quotations from Hebrew translations of portions of various New Testament books - including the epistles of Paul - can be found in rabbinical treatises against Catholicism. These treatises multiplied wherever Jews lived in proximity to Christians - such as Spain before the [[History of the Jews in Spain|expulsion of the Jews from Spain]] in 1492.

* ''[[Toledot Yeshu]]''; "Life of Jesus", 7th century.
* ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]''; "Wars of the Lord" of Jacob Ben Reuben 12th century, which cites texts including Matthew 1:1-16, 3:13-17, 4:1-11, 5:33-40, 11:25-27, 12:1-8, 26:36-39, 28:16-20.

Jean Carmignac (Paris 1969, BNES 1978) identified fifty Hebrew translations of the [[Lord's Prayer]] from the 9th to the 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;"Hebrew Translations of the Lord's Prayer: An Historical Survey. BNES 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jakob Josef Petuchowski, Michael Brocke ''The Lord's Prayer and Jewish liturgy'' 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evans ''Jesus and His Contemporaries: Comparative Studies'' 2001 p294 "Carmignac ("Hebrew Translations," 21-49) provides fifty Hebrew translations of the Lord's prayer ranging from the ninth to the eighteenth centuries, as well as many more from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries."&lt;/ref&gt; Most scholars consider that the medieval Hebrew manuscripts are derived by translation from medieval Greek or Latin manuscripts, and therefore that it is extremely unlikely that any of the unique readings found in these medieval Hebrew manuscripts could be ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Four principal versions in rabbinical Hebrew of Matthew have survived or partially survived:

===Shem Tov's ''Matthew'', 1385===
[[File:Shemtobfirstpage.gif|thumb|240px|Shem Tov first page]]
The '''Shem Tov Matthew''' (or '''Shem Tob's Matthew''') consists of a complete text of [[Gospel of Matthew]] in the [[Hebrew language]] found interspersed among anti-Catholic commentary in the 12th volume of a polemical treatise ''The Touchstone'' (c.1380-85) by [[Shem Tov ben Isaac ben Shaprut]] (Ibn Shaprut), a Jewish physician living in [[Aragon]], after whom the version is named. Shem Tov debated Cardinal Pedro de Luna (later [[Antipope Benedict XIII]]) on [[original sin]] and redemption in Pamplona, December 26, 1375, in the presence of bishops and learned theologians. Nine manuscripts of ''The Touchstone'' survive, though if an independent version of the text of Matthew used by Ibn Shaprut ever existed then it is lost. 

Spanish Jews of Ibn Shaprut's period were familiar with the New Testament in Latin. Jacob Ben Reuben in his ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem|Wars of the Lord]]'' translated [[Gilbert Crispin]]'s ''Disputation of Jews and Christians'' from Latin into Hebrew, along with quotes from Matthew. Lasker (1998) remarks that "By the fourteenth century, most likely every Iberian anti-Christian Jewish polemicist knew Latin." [[Moses ha-Kohen de Tordesillas]] made proficient use of Latin phrases. Profiat Duran (fl.1380-1420) had extensive knowledge of Latin Christian texts, and devoted a chapter of his ''Disgrace of the Gentiles'' (Klimat ha-goyim) to criticism of Jerome's [[Latin Vulgate]]. [[Hayyim ben Judah ibn Musa]] argued with [[Nicholas de Lyra]] in his ''Book of Shield and Spear'' (Sefer magen va-romah).&lt;ref&gt;Daniel J. Lasker in ''In Iberia and beyond: Hispanic Jews between cultures'' ed. Bernard Dov Cooperman 1998 p176&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise converts to Christianity such as [[Abner of Burgos]] ([[Alphonso of Valladolid]], ca. 1270-1347) continued to write polemical, theological, philosophical, and scientific works in Hebrew. 

Shem Tov's ''The Touchstone'' (''Eben = stone, bohan = test'') has never been translated into English or published. It follows the model of ''[[Milhamoth ha-Shem]]'' of Jacob Ben Reuben in use of Matthew but contains not just sections of Matthew as Jacob Ben Reuben, but the whole text of Matthew and parts of Mark. [[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]] excised the text of Matthew from among Shem Tov's comments and published it separately as ''The Gospel of Matthew according to a primitive Hebrew text'' (1987), a revised version ''Hebrew Gospel of Matthew'' (1995).&lt;ref&gt;William Horbury Appendix pp729 in ''A Critical and Exegetical Commentary on the Gospel According to Saint Matthew'' ed. . D. Davies, William David Davies, Dale C. Allison&lt;/ref&gt;

Shem Tov's quotations of Matthew in ''The Touchstone'' are marked by [[Judaism|Jewish]] thought, and are interspaced with the comments of the author. As a consequence several scholars{{Who|date=January 2011}} feel it is difficult to determine which parts are Shem Tov's commentary, and which parts are the actual text of the source he was quoting. Many scholars{{Who|date=January 2011}} view the text as a mediaeval translation from the Greek text of the Gospel of Matthew, as well as being the likely source of all later Hebrew versions of Matthew prior to the 20th century.

Where the [[Tetragrammaton]] occurs in [[Tanakh]] quotations, instead one finds a single Hebrew ''[[He (letter)|He]]'' (ה) except in one place where the word "ha-shem" (השם, the name) is spelled out. There are some interesting readings of Matthew in ''The Touchstone''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol03/Petersen1998a.html Some Observations on a Recent Edition of and Introduction to Shem-Tob's "Hebrew Matthew"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Matt 12:37 "According to your words you will be judged, and according to your deeds you will be convicted."
* Matt 24:40-41 "40 Then if there shall be two ploughing in a field, one righteous and the other evil, the one will be taken and the other left. 41 Two women will be grinding at a mill; one will be taken and the other left. This is because the angels at the end of the world will remove the stumbling blocks from the world and will separate the good from the evil."
* Matt 28:9 "As they were going Jesus passed before them saying: 'May the Name deliver you.'"
* Matt 28:19-20 "Go and teach them to carry out all the things which I have commanded you forever."
* Mark 9:20-28 is placed into the text of Matthew between Matt 17:17 and 17:19.  Matt 17:18 is omitted.&lt;ref&gt;http://rosetta.reltech.org/TC/vol03/Petersen1998a.html Some Observations on a Recent Edition of and Introduction to Shem-Tob's "Hebrew Matthew"&lt;/ref&gt;

While the quotations in Shem Tov's ''The Touchstone'', which are interspersed in his own commentary, diverge from the canonical text of Matthew, the text of the ''Münster Matthew'' and the ''Du Tillet Matthew'' are significantly very close to it in many passages.

===Sebastian Münster's ''Matthew,'' 1537===
The '''Münster Matthew''' is a printed version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]], written in the [[Hebrew language]]  published by [[Sebastian Münster]] in 1537 and dedicated to King Henry VIII of England. He had received the text from Spanish Jews he had converted to Christianity in the 1530s.{{cn|date=May 2013}} Apparently, these Jews had been using the text to understand the Christian religion in order to counter it. Münster felt that the text was defective, and set about reworking it. The original manuscript he received no longer exists; only his printed reworking of it survives, and it closely resembles the ''Du Tillet Matthew''. Because the places where Münster changed the text is unknown, this text can be difficult to use for [[textual criticism]].

===Jean du Tillet's ''Matthew,'' 1555===
The '''Du Tillet Matthew''' is a version of the [[Gospel of Matthew]], written in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], known as Heb.MSS.132, and residing in the National Library, Paris. The manuscript was obtained by Bishop [[Jean du Tillet]] from Italian Jews on a visit to [[Rome]] in 1553, and published in 1555, with editing by [[Jean Mercier (Hebraist)]] and addition of a Latin version, dedicated to cardinal Charles de Guise. 

While the text is less divergent from the Greek textual tradition than is the ''Shem Tov Matthew'', this version share some deviations in common with the ''Shem Tov Matthew''; for example, the [[Tetragrammaton]] is replaced with a sign composed of three [[yodh]]s or dots enclosed in a semicircle. [[Jean Cinqarbres]] (Quinquarboreus), Hebrew professor of the College Royal also worked on the Du Tillet Matthew.

===Rahabi Ezekiel's ''Matthew,'' 1750===
Rabbi [[Rahabi Ezekiel]]'s ''Ha-sepher shel we-'angilu shel ha-Nosarim shel Yeshu'' [The book of the Gospel belonging to the followers of Jesus] is a polemical translation of Matthew dating from 1750.&lt;ref&gt;Pinchas Lapide ''Hebrew in the church: the foundations of Jewish-Christian dialogue'' 1984&lt;/ref&gt; This may or may not be the same as the polemical rabbinical Hebrew New Testament of Rabbi Ezekiel bought by Claudius Buchanan in [[Cochin]] and known as the "Travancore Hebrew New Testament", which led Buchanan to urge [[Joseph Frey]] to commence work on a Christian translation.&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Goldman ''God's sacred tongue: Hebrew &amp; the American imagination'' p108  2004 "In Travancore he purchased a large collection of Hebrew manuscripts that included both a chronicle of the Jews of Cochin and a Hebrew New Testament. Buchanan identified the translator of the New Testament as one Rabbi Ezekiel,"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elias Soloweyczyk's ''Matthew,'' 1869===
{{main|Elias Soloweyczyk}}

==Christian Hebrew versions==
Around half of the 20 known Christian translations of Matthew were also done by authors who were formerly rabbis, or came from a rabbinical training: [[Domenico Gerosolimitano]] and [[Giovanni Battista Jona]], [[Rudolph Bernhard]], [[Johan Kemper]], Simon Rosenbaum (of Uppsala),&lt;ref&gt;Biblical and Near Eastern studies: essays in honor of William  Sanford La Sor, Gary A. Tuttle - 1978 "1727 Simon Rosenbaum: Uppsala, O. Hebr. 31, p. 7ro This translation of the New Testament up to Gal 2:15 is in fact anonymous, but has been attributed to Simon Rosenbaum, the successor of Johan Kemper, by Hans Joachim Schoeps"&lt;/ref&gt; [[Christian David Ginsburg]] and [[Yitzhak Salkinsohn|Isaac Salkinson]].&lt;ref&gt;Jean Carmignac, "Hebrew Translations of the Lord's Prayer: A Historical Survey," in ''Biblical and Near Eastern studies: essays in honor of William Sanford LaSor'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1979), pp. 18."My list of translators (or editors) is as follows: [[Shem Tob ben Shafrut]], [[Sebastian Munster]], [[Jean Cinqarbres]], [[Jean du Tillet]], [[Marco Marini]](?), [[Elias Hutter]], [[Domenico Gerosolimitano]], [[Georg Mayr]] [Bavarian Jesuit 1564-1623], [[Giovanni Battista Jona]], [[William Robertson (Hebraist)]], [[Rudolph Bernhard]], [[Johannes Kemper]], [[Simon Rosenbaum]], [[Ezekiel Rahabi]], [[Richard Caddick]], [[Thomas Yeates (orientalist)]], [[The London Society for Promoting Christianity amongst the Jews]], [[William Greenfield]], [[Robert Young (Biblical scholar)]],  [[Elias Soloweyczyk]], [[Franz Delitzsch]], [[Yitzhak Salkinsohn|Isaac Salkinson]] and [[J. M. Paul Bauchet]]."&lt;/ref&gt; However the principal modern Hebrew version of Matthew is based on the New Testament of a German, [[Franz Delitzsch]].

==Shem Tov's ''Touchstone'' in Christian Aramaic primacy debate==
{{main|Aramaic primacy}}
The hypotheses of Hebrew and [[Aramaic primacy]] posit that the Gospel of Matthew was originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic. Scholars who support these hypotheses sometimes appeal to these 3 medieval Hebrew manuscripts. However, the vast majority of scholars believe Matthew was originally written in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;Brown 1997, p. 210 "There are medieval Hebrew forms of Matt that most scholars think of as retroversions from the Greek of canonical Matt, often made to serve in arguments between Christians and Jews. However, some claim that these texts are a guide to the original Hebrew of Matt (French scholars like J. Carmignac and M. Dubarle have contributed to this thesis...) Still other scholars think they can reconstruct the original Hebrew or Aramaic underlying the whole or parts of the Greek text of canonical Matt on the assumption that the original was in Semitic... The vast majority of scholars, however, contend that the Gospel we know as Matt was composed originally in Greek and is not a translation of a Semitic original... Brown, Raymond E. An Introduction to the New Testament"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]], Associate Professor of Religion and Hebrew at the [[University of Georgia]] has argued (1995) that some or all of these three medieval Hebrew versions may have descended (without any intervening translation) from ancient Hebrew manuscripts of Matthew, which may have been used by early Christians in the 1st or 2nd century, but were nearly extinct by the time of Jerome, late in the 4th century.&lt;ref&gt;Howard 1995&lt;/ref&gt; 

However the surviving citations from [[Jewish-Christian Gospels]] (namely [[Gospel of the Nazarenes]], [[Gospel of the Ebionites]] and [[Gospel of the Hebrews]]) preserved in the writings of [[Jerome]], [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] and others, lead critical scholars to conclude that those Gospels themselves either were Greek or were translated from Greek Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;[[Philipp Vielhauer]] section in NTA1&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, most scholars consider that the medieval Hebrew manuscripts were descended (by translation) from medieval Greek or Latin manuscripts, and therefore that it is extremely unlikely that any of the unique readings found in these medieval Hebrew manuscripts could be ancient.
&lt;ref&gt;Petersen 1998&lt;/ref&gt; 

Horbury (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Horbury W. ''Hebrew study from Ezra to Ben-Yehuda'' 1999 p129 "These features are probably to be explained, however, not, as Howard thinks, from the influence of a gospel in Hebrew current among the early Christians, but rather from the encounter of Jews over the years with various forms of gospel text in other languages;"&lt;/ref&gt; notes that the characteristics of ibn Shaprut's ''Touchstone'' are better explained by the influence of Latin Gospel harmonies.

==Patristic testimony==
{{main|Gospel of the Hebrews}}
There was a strong tradition in the early church, attested by [[Papias of Hierapolis|Papias]], [[Irenaeus]], [[Origen]], [[Eusebius]], [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]], and [[Jerome]], that Matthew had written a gospel in the Hebrew language (although some of them may have conflated Hebrew and Aramaic languages). Irenaeus, Epiphanius, and Jerome identify the Gospel of the Hebrews with this Hebrew gospel of Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Schoemaker, W. R. (1902). The Gospel According to the Hebrews. The University of Chicago Press. p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of Jerome, some commentators believed that the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'' was the original Gospel of Matthew.&lt;ref&gt;Jerome, ''Commentary on Matthew'' 2 . 12&lt;/ref&gt; [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] in the ''Panarion'' wrote that,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"They [Jewish Christians] too accept Matthew's gospel and like the followers of Cerinthus and Merinthus, they use it alone. They call it the ''Gospel of the Hebrews'', for in truth, Matthew alone of the New Covenant writers expounded and declared the gospel in Hebrew using Hebrew script."&lt;ref&gt;Epiphanius, ''Panarion,'' 30 . 3 . 7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Papias and the Hebrew Tradition of Matthew===
About whether Matthew was written in Hebrew, Papias (as quoted by Eusebius) wrote this:
: Mark having become the interpreter of Peter, wrote down accurately whatsoever he remembered. It was not, however, in exact order that he related the sayings or deeds of Christ. For he neither heard the Lord nor accompanied Him. But afterwards, as I said, he accompanied Peter, who accommodated his instructions to the necessities [of his hearers], but with no intention of giving a regular narrative of the Lord's sayings. Wherefore Mark made no mistake in thus writing some things as he remembered them. For of one thing he took especial care, not to omit anything he had heard, and not to put anything fictitious into the statements. Matthew put together the oracles [of the Lord] in the Hebrew language, and each one interpreted them as best he could.

Citing this text, many argue that Papias claimed that Matthew was written in the Hebrew language, (as it is often translated in English). However, Papias' comment in Greek, (Ματθαῖος μέν οὖν '''Ἑβραίδι διαλέκτῳ''' τά λόγια, "Hebrew dialect") is a common construction in Greek and is seen in many different sources and contexts and seems to consistently refer to a style or subset of a language being spoken; and, this is distinguished from the general Greek term for language or tongue, "γλῶσσα". Papias' statement seems to signify a style of language or dialect being used by the "Hebrews", (or in other words, the style or subset of a language being used by the Hebrew race). In the historical context, the "dialect of the Hebrews", (Ἑβραίδι διαλέκτῳ), was most probably a reference to Hebrew's congener, Aramaic.&lt;ref&gt;

: Flavius Jospehus Antiquities of the Jews Bk 5, Sec 121: ... δὲ ὄνομα τοῦτο σημαίνει Ζεβεκηνῶν κύριος: ἀδωνὶ γὰρ τῇ Ἑβραίων '''διαλέκτῳ''' κύριος γίνεται:

: Diodorus Siculus, Library: Bk 13, Chap 35: ... ἢ ἐξηγητὴν τοῦ νομοθέτου, διὰ τὸ τοὺς νόμους γεγραμμένους ἀρχαίᾳ '''διαλέκτῳ''' δοκεῖν εἶναι δυσκατανοήτους. μεγάλης δὲ οὔσης κατὰ τὴν νομοθεσίαν

: Diogenes Laertius, Lives of Eminent Philosophers Bk 2, Chap 8: ... διάλογοι πέντε καὶ εἴκοσιν, οἱ μὲν Ἀτθίδι, οἱ δὲ Δωρίδι '''διαλέκτῳ''' γεγραμμένοι οἵδε: 84 Ἀρτάβαζος.

: Acts, Chap 2: ... τὸ πλῆθος καὶ συνεχύθη, ὅτι ἤκουσεν εἷς ἕκαστος τῇ ἰδίᾳ '''διαλέκτῳ''' λαλούντων αὐτῶν: ἐξίσταντο δὲ καὶ ἐθαύμαζον λέγοντες Οὐχὶ ἰδοὺ... λαλοῦντες Γαλιλαῖοι; καὶ πῶς ἡμεῖς ἀκούομεν ἕκαστος τῇ ἰδίᾳ '''διαλέκτῳ''' ἡμῶν ἐν ᾗ ἐγεννήθημεν; Πάρθοι καὶ Μῆδοι καὶ&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Regional Science Association International''' ('''RSAI''') is a cluster of scholarly societies whose members engage in [[regional science]].

==Origins==
In the late 1940s and the early 1950s, the economist [[Walter Isard]] worked to draw together a group of academics interested in analyzing regional (i.e., sub-national) development. These academics were drawn from a number of disciplines: economics, geography, city planning, political science and rural sociology. Naming their new approach ''regional science'', they envisioned it as an interdisciplinary effort, one that would require unique theoretical concepts, methodological tools, and data. Because their effort was interdisciplinary, no existing academic organization brought the participants together; they therefore created their own organization, the ''Regional Science Association'', which first met in December 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 32-34&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1961, the RSA had 960 members, and its first local "section", which organized conferences for regional scientists located in the western United States. The next section to form (in 1963) was in Japan, followed by sections throughout Europe, as well as in India, Argentina, and Brazil. In 1969, the Western section and the Japan section began to cooperate in holding a biennial ''Pacific Rim'' international conference.&lt;ref&gt;Boyce 2003: 35&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually issues of coordination among the various sections were worked out, resulting in much the present structure by 1990. The ''Regional Science Association International'' (RSAI) now functions as the umbrella organization for three other organizations: the ''Pacific Regional Science Conference Organization'', the ''North American Regional Science Council'', and the ''European Regional Science Association''. Each of these serve as the umbrella organization for a number of other organizations, as seen in the next section.

The method was introduced by [[George E. P. Box]] and K. B. Wilson in 1951.  The main idea of RSM is to use a sequence of [[design of experiments|designed experiments]] to obtain an optimal response.  Box and Wilson suggest using a [[Degree of a polynomial|second-degree]] [[polynomial]] model to do this.  They acknowledge that this model is only an approximation, but they use it because such a model is easy to estimate and apply, even when little is known about the process.

Statistical approaches such as RSM can be employed to maximize the production of a special substance by optimization of operational factors. In contrast to conventional methods, the interaction among process variables can be determined by statistical techniques.&lt;ref name="Organosolv"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Asadi|first1=Nooshin|last2=Zilouei|first2=Hamid|title=Optimization of organosolv pretreatment of rice straw for enhanced biohydrogen production using Enterobacter aerogenes|journal=Bioresource Technology|date=March 2017|volume=227|pages=335–344|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2016.12.073|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311881656_Optimization_of_organosolv_pretreatment_of_rice_straw_for_enhanced_biohydrogen_production_using_Enterobacter_aerogenes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Maged, Salah Haridy, Mohammad Shamsuzzaman, Imad Alsyouf, and Roubi Zaied.

==Basic approach of response surface methodology==
An easy way to estimate a first-degree polynomial model is to use a [[factorial experiment]] or a [[fractional factorial design]].  This is sufficient to determine which explanatory variables affect the response variable(s) of interest.  Once it is suspected that only significant explanatory variables are left, then a more complicated design, such as a [[central composite design]] can be implemented to estimate a second-degree polynomial model, which is still only an approximation at best.  However, the second-degree model can be used to optimize (maximize, minimize, or attain a specific target for).

==Important RSM properties and features==

''ORTHOGONALITY:''
The property that allows individual effects of the k-factors to be estimated independently without (or with minimal) confounding. Also orthogonality provides minimum variance estimates of the model coefficient so that they are uncorrelated.

''ROTATABILITY'':
The property of rotating points of the design about the center of the factor space. The moments of the distribution of the design points are constant.

''UNIFORMITY:''
A third property of CCD designs used to control the number of center points is uniform precision (or Uniformity).

==Special geometries==

===Cube===
Cubic designs are discussed by Kiefer, by Atkinson, Donev, and Tobias and by Hardin and Sloane.

===Sphere===
[[Spherical design]]s are discussed by Kiefer and by Hardin and Sloane.

===Simplex geometry and mixture experiments===
Mixture experiments are discussed in many books on the [[design of experiments]], and in the response-surface methodology textbooks of Box and Draper and of Atkinson, Donev and Tobias. An extensive discussion and survey appears in the advanced textbook by John Cornell.

==Extensions==

&lt;!-- ===Constraints=== --&gt;

===Multiple objective functions===
{{see also|Multiobjective optimization|Pareto efficiency}}
Some extensions of response surface methodology deal with the multiple response problem.  Multiple response variables create difficulty because what is optimal for one response may not be optimal for other responses.  Other extensions are used to reduce variability in a single response while targeting a specific value, or attaining a near maximum or minimum while preventing variability in that response from getting too large.

==Practical concerns==
Response surface methodology uses statistical models, and therefore practitioners need to be aware that even the best statistical model is an approximation to reality. In practice, both the models and the parameter values are unknown, and subject to uncertainty on top of ignorance. Of course, an estimated optimum point need not be optimum in reality, because of the errors of the estimates and of the inadequacies of the model.

Nonetheless, response surface methodology has an effective track-record of helping researchers improve products and services: For example, Box's original response-surface modeling enabled chemical engineers to improve a process that had been stuck at a saddle-point for years. The engineers had not been able to afford to fit a cubic three-level design to estimate a quadratic model, and their [[Bias (statistics)|biased]] linear-models estimated the gradient to be zero. Box's design reduced the costs of experimentation so that a quadratic model could be fit, which led to a (long-sought) ascent direction.&lt;ref&gt;Box, G. E. P. and Wilson, K.B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4718">'''Sander L. Gilman''' (born February 21, 1944) is an American [[cultural history|cultural]] and [[history of literature|literary historian]].&lt;ref name="psp"&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/index.html Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; He is known for his contributions to [[Jewish studies]] and the [[history of medicine]]. He is the author or editor of over ninety books.

Gilman's focus is on medicine and the echoes of its rhetoric in social and political discourse. In particular, Gilman investigates the constellations of medical, social, and political discourse that emerge at certain historical junctures.

==Academic career==

Gilman obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] degree in [[German language]] and [[German literature|literature]] from [[Tulane University]] in 1963, where he proceeded to gain his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree, also in German, in 1968. He was a Professor at [[Cornell University]] (1976–1995), then moving to the [[University of Chicago]] for six years (1994–2000). He was then at the [[University of Illinois]] at Chicago for four years, founding its Program in Jewish Studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.emory.edu/SanderGilman/Dr.%20GilmanCV%20updated%20Dec%2008.pdf Emory.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 he was appointed a distinguished professor of the Liberal Arts and Sciences at [[Emory University]], where he was the Director of the Program in Psychoanalysis as well as of Emory University’s Health Sciences Humanities Initiative.  During 2017-8 he was the Alliance Professor of History at the Ludwig Maximilian University, Munich.

In 2007 he was appointed Professor, Institute in the Humanities, Birkbeck College (London) and a Visiting Fellow of the new Institute of Advanced Studies, Warwick University, UK. He was president of the [[Modern Language Association]] in 1995.  He has been awarded a Doctor of Laws (honoris causa) at the University of Toronto in 1997, elected an honorary professor of the Free University in Berlin (2000), made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 2008 and made a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2016).

==Writing==
His ''Stand Up Straight! A History of Posture'' appeared with Reaktion Press (London) in 2018; his most recent edited volume is ''Jews on the Move:  Modern Cosmopolitanist Thought and Its Others'' published in 2018.   He is the author of the basic study of the visual stereotyping of the mentally ill, ''Seeing the Insane'', published by John Wiley and Sons in 1982 (reprinted: 1996) as well as the standard study of ''[[Jewish Self-Hatred]]'', the title of his Johns Hopkins University Press monograph of 1986."&lt;ref name="psp"/&gt;

===Freud===

He has examined [[Sigmund Freud]], addressing the question of what role, if any, was played by Freud’s Jewish origins in his composition of the psychoanalytic corpus. Gilman’s thesis concerning this subject is that the prejudices of biology in the nineteenth century classified the Jew as being somehow [[Femininity|feminine]], a [[social stigma|stigma]] that Freud sought to escape by carving out a scientific niche of his own. Licensed by his own brand of science, Freud could simultaneously lay claim to the [[manhood]] that the Viennese scientific establishment of the nineteenth century threatened to deny him, and also to the neutrality that was the warrant of its authority.

To make the case that contemporaneous [[anti-Semitism]] shaped Freud’s thought, Gilman provides a catalogue of the most egregious anti-Semitic stereotypes of the time and place, including straightforward documentation of certain anti-Semitic prejudices, such as the belief in Jewish [[male menstruation]],&lt;ref&gt;Gilman, Sander. ''Creating Beauty to Cure the Soul''. 1998, page 86.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as period depictions of anti-Semitic [[stereotypes]] in graphic media.

==Editorial board membership==
Gilman sits on the Honorary International Advisory Board of the [[Mens Sana Monographs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msmonographs.org/aboutus.asp Member, Hon Int Advisory Board]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6259">The '''Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory''' (SABO) is a nonprofit membership-supported scientific and educational organization founded in 1996 in [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]], [[Arizona]], USA.  The mission of the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory is to promote the conservation of the birds of southeastern Arizona, their habitats, and the diversity of species that share those habitats through research, monitoring, and public education.  

The observatory's founders and current directors are Tom Wood and Sheri Williamson, former managers of [[The Nature Conservancy]]'s [[Ramsey Canyon Preserve]], and Mark Newstrom.

==Monitoring bird diversity==

Southeastern Arizona is at a biogeographic crossroads, where the [[Rocky Mountains]] meet the [[Sierra Madre Occidental]] of [[Mexico]] and the [[Chihuahuan Desert]] blends into the [[Sonoran Desert]].  Isolated mountain ranges known as "[[sky islands]]" are home to a variety of animal and plant species found nowhere else in the [[United States]].  The [[San Pedro River, Arizona|San Pedro River]] flows north from the mountains of northern [[Sonora]], Mexico providing a highway for millions of migrating birds every spring and fall.  The [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)|Santa Cruz River]] and [[Sonoita Creek]] also provide [[riparian]] habitat for breeding and migrating birds and other wildlife.  Much of the best remaining wildlife habitat in the region is in the [[Coronado National Forest]], national and state parks, national wildlife refuges and conservation areas, state wildlife areas, military reservations, and [[The Nature Conservancy|Nature Conservancy]] preserves. 

The Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory has conducted various monitoring projects both independently and in cooperation with public agencies.  Its longest-running research project, in cooperation with the [[United States Bureau of Land Management]] and Friends of the San Pedro River, is a study of the [[hummingbird]]s that use the [[San Pedro River, Arizona|San Pedro River]] as a migratory corridor or breeding area.&lt;ref name="band1"&gt;City of Sierra Vista, AZ YouTube channel: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2VXtUC3J0Jw Hummingbird Banding]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="band2"&gt;Davis, Tony. [http://www.azstarnet.com/sn/science/305680 "Tiny bird banded in AZ recaptured after humdinger of a flight"], ''[[Arizona Daily Star]]'', 2008-08-20.&lt;/ref&gt;  Banding sessions are open to the public, which has allowed thousands of visitors to observe research in progress and learn more about hummingbirds, other migratory birds, the ecological significance of the San Pedro River, and other conservation issues. Past projects include migration monitoring and breeding bird monitoring under the MAPS ([[Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship]]) Program&lt;ref name="maps"&gt;Institute for Bird Populations: [http://www.birdpop.org/maps.htm Monitoring Avian Productivity and Survivorship (MAPS) Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070920120302/http://www.birdpop.org/maps.htm |date=2007-09-20 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[United States National Park Service|National Park Service]] and [[United States Fish &amp; Wildlife Service|Fish &amp; Wildlife Service]].  SABO is a participant in the Landbird Monitoring Network of the Americas.&lt;ref name="lamna1"&gt;[http://www.klamathbird.org/lamna/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lamna2"&gt;U.S. Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station: [http://www.fs.fed.us/psw/topics/wildlife/birdmon/pif/mnstalst.shtml Landbird Monitoring Network of the Americas: Member Organizations and Stations]. Retrieved on 2009-10-28.&lt;/ref&gt;  Informal surveys of wintering raptors are integrated into weekly public tours of the southern [[Sulphur Springs Valley, Arizona|Sulphur Springs Valley]], between [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] and [[Elfrida, Arizona|Elfrida]].

==Ecotourism and outreach==

Southeastern Arizona consistently ranks as one of the top five [[birding]] locations in the United States. Tens of thousands of birders visit the area each year, making [[Ecotourism|nature-based tourism]] an important asset to the regional economy.  The area's natural attractions also lure active retirees and others interested in relocating to areas with diverse opportunities for outdoor recreation.  To cultivate environmental awareness and advocacy among both residents and tourists, the Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory offers bird walks, workshops, other educational activities in both Arizona and northwestern Mexico,&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Wilcove, David S. [http://www.birds.cornell.edu/NetCommunity/LbPrintPage.aspx?print=725 "Border Traffic: The challenge of saving Mexico’s vanishing Thick-billed Parrots"]. ''Living Bird'', [[Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology]], Winter 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and volunteer opportunities. 

The Southeastern Arizona Bird Observatory also supports community-based outreach and economic development programs such as the Southwest Wings [[Birding]] and Nature Festival, the Wings Over [[Willcox, Arizona|Willcox]] [[Sandhill crane|Sandhill Crane]] Celebration, and the Southeastern Arizona Birding Trail.

The '''Southern California Marine Institute (SCMI)''' is a multi-campus research facility and [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[Oceanography|oceanographic institution]] headquartered in [[Terminal Island, California]].

==History==
In the late 1960s, marine scientists working at six campuses of the [[California State University|CSU system]] in the [[Los Angeles basin]] (Dominguez Hills, Fullerton, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Northridge, and Cal Poly Pomona) proposed the formation of an institute that would provide the advancement of marine programs. It was until 1971, when the university system decided to purchase the naval vessel R/V Nautilus for that specific purpose. In 1972, the creation of the Southern California Ocean Studies Consortium (SCOSC) was approved by the Trustees and the Presidents of the founding campuses and the operation of the R/V Nautilus floating marine laboratory began.

The University of California Los Angeles is in partnership with the Institute, thereby increasing marine research in Los Angeles, and providing educational opportunities for its students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newsroom.ucla.edu/portal/ucla/ucla-joins-the-southern-california-188738.aspx |title=UCLA joins Southern California Marine Institute to revitalize marine research in Los Angeles |first1=Kim |last1=DeRose |date=December 17, 2010 |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Twinkling''', or '''scintillation''', is a generic term for variations in [[apparent brightness]] or [[apparent place|position]] of a distant luminous object viewed through a medium.&lt;ref name="intech"&gt;Wang,Ting-I; Williams, Donn; [http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=/ContentManagement/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=44354 "Scintillation technology bests NIST"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215902/http://www.isa.org/InTechTemplate.cfm?Section=Article_Index1&amp;template=%2FContentManagement%2FContentDisplay.cfm&amp;ContentID=44354 |date=2013-10-04 }}, ''InTech'', May 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; If the object lies outside the [[Earth's atmosphere]], as in the case of stars and [[planet]]s, the phenomenon is termed ''astronomical scintillation''; within the atmosphere, the phenomenon is termed ''terrestrial scintillation.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/hqlibrary/aerospacedictionary/508/508index.htm " NASA Aerospace Science and Technology Dictionary"], ''NASA.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the three principal factors governing [[astronomical seeing]], atmospheric twinkling is defined as variations in [[illuminance]] only.

In simple terms, twinkling of stars is caused by the passing of light through [[air mass (astronomy)|different layers]] of a turbulent atmosphere. Most scintillation effects are caused by anomalous [[refraction]] caused by small-scale fluctuations in [[air density]] usually related to temperature gradients.&lt;ref&gt;Sofieva, V. F.; Sofieva, A.S.; et al. [http://www.athena-spu.gr/ftp/lfsc/Literature/Sofieva_2007_GOMOS_GW-TurbulenceParamReconstruction.pdf "Reconstruction of internal gravity wave and turbulence parameters in the stratosphere using GOMOS scintillation measurements"]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} ''Journal of Geophysical Research'' '''112'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;VanCleave, Janice; [http://scienceprojectideasforkids.com/2010/stellar-scintillation-twinkling-stars/ "Stellar Scintillation: Twinkling Stars"] ''JVC's Science Fair Projects'', May 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Scintillation effects are always much more pronounced near the [[horizon]] than near the [[zenith]] (straight up),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nws.noaa.gov/om/educ/activit/scint.htm "Scintillation or Atmospheric Boil"], ''noaa.gov''&lt;/ref&gt; since the light near the horizon passes through a thicker layer of atmosphere. Atmospheric twinkling is measured quantitatively using a [[scintillometer]].&lt;ref&gt;Chun, M.; Avila, R; [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/2002ASPC..266...72C "Turbulence profiling using a scanning scintillometer"], ''Astronomical Site Evaluation in the Visible and Radio Range'', Astronomical Society of the Pacific '''266''':72-78&lt;/ref&gt; The effects of twinkling are reduced by using a larger receiver [[aperture]].  This effect is known as ''aperture averaging''.&lt;ref&gt;Perlot,.N.; Fritzsche, D. [http://elib.dlr.de/7341/1/LASE2004-5338-29_Perlot_ApAv_measur_HANDOUT.pdf "Aperture-Averaging - Theory and Measurements"], ''elib - Electronic Library''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Andrews |first1=C. |last2=Phillips |first2=R.L |last3=Hopen |first3=C. |year=2000 |title=Aperture averaging of optical scintillations |journal=Waves in Random and Complex Media |volume=10 |issue=1 |pages=53–70 |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While light from stars and other [[astronomical object]]s are likely to twinkle,&lt;ref&gt;Wheelon, Albert D. [https://books.google.com/books/about/Electromagnetic_Scintillation_Volume_2_W.html?id=CNPtmZJZWCAC "Electromagnetic Scintillation: Volume 2, Weak Scattering"], ''Cambridge University Press,'' Jul 31, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; twinkling usually does not cause images of planets to flicker appreciably.&lt;ref&gt;Kenyon, S.L.; Lawrence, M. et al; [http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/~mcba/pubs/kenyon06.pdf "Atmospheric Scintillation at Dome C, Antarctica"], ''Astronomical Society of the Pacific'' '''118''' 924-932&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ellison |first1=M.

Stars twinkle because they are so far from Earth that they appear as point sources of light easily disturbed by Earth's atmospheric [[turbulence]], which acts like lenses and prisms [[atmospheric refraction|diverting]] the light's path. Large astronomical objects closer to Earth, like the [[Moon]] and other planets, encompass many points in space and can be resolved as objects with observable diameters. With multiple observed points of light traversing the atmosphere, their light's deviations average out and the viewer perceives less variation in light coming from them.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, John A.

'''The Faculty of Information (or the [[iSchool]] at the [[University of Toronto]])''' is a graduate school that offers the following programs: a Master of Information (MI), a Master of Museum Studies (MMSt), and a PhD in Information Studies, as well as diploma courses. As a member of the ''[http://www.ischools.org/ iSchool movement]'', the Faculty of Information takes an interdisciplinary approach to [[information studies]], building on its traditional strengths in library and information science, complemented by research and teaching in [[archives]], [[museum studies]], information systems and design, critical information studies, culture and technology, knowledge management, [[digital humanities]], the [[history of books]], and other related fields. It is located on St. George Campus, in the [[Claude Bissell]] building, at 140 St. George Street, which is attached to the [[John P. Robarts Research Library]] and the [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]].

== History ==
The Faculty of Information was founded as the University of Toronto Library School within the [[Ontario College of Education]] in 1928 and was housed at 315 Bloor Street.&lt;ref&gt;Bassam, Bertha. ''The Faculty of Library Science University of Toronto and Its Predecessors, 1911-1972''. University of Toronto Press, 1978, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1965, the School was designated as an independent unit within the university and became known as the School of Library Science and thus moved it quarters to 167 College Street and 256 McCaul Street.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Information. ''Mission &amp; History''. Retrieved 2011-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, SLS moved again to its present location at 140 St. George Street.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Information. ''Mission &amp; History''. Retrieved 2011-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, the name changed to the Faculty of Library Science (FLS), as the school attained faculty status.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Information. ''Mission &amp; History''. Retrieved 2011-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The name changed again to the Faculty of Library and Information Science (FLIS) in 1982 and then the Faculty of Information Studies (FIS) in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Information. ''Mission &amp; History''. Retrieved 2011-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, FIS joined the ''[http://www.ischools.org/ iSchool Caucus]'' and accordingly in 2008, it was renamed the Faculty of Information (FI), also identifying itself as "the [[iSchool]] at Toronto".&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Information.

The faculty has offered a variety of degrees since its inception, which at the same time reflect the changing requirements of entry into librarianship and more recently, into other information professions. Between 1928 and 1936, it offered one-year university Diploma in Librarianship, and from 1936 to 1970, a one-year Bachelor of Library Science degree, which was [[accredited by the American Library Association]] in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Bassam, Bertha. ''The Faculty of Library Science University of Toronto and Its Predecessors, 1911-1972''. University of Toronto Press, 1978, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; The late 1960s saw the emergence of the Master of Library Science (MLS) degree as the first professional degree in librarianship, which was introduced in the School in 1970 and required four semesters to complete.&lt;ref&gt;Bassam, Bertha. ''The Faculty of Library Science University of Toronto and Its Predecessors, 1911-1972''. University of Toronto Press, 1978, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; Doctoral program, leading to a Doctor of Philosophy was established in 1971, with Claire England holding the first Ph.D. in library science that was awarded in Canada in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Bassam, Bertha. ''The Faculty of Library Science University of Toronto and Its Predecessors, 1911-1972''. University of Toronto Press, 1978, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, the faculty began to offer a Master of Information Science (MIS) degree. In 1995, the MLS and MIS degrees were both replaced with the Master of Information Studies (MISt) degree, which had three areas of specialization: archival studies, information systems, and library and information science. The name of the degree was changed to Master of Information (MI) in 2009.

Since 2006, when the Department of Museum Studies became part of FIS, the faculty began to offer a Master of Museum Studies degree.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty of Information. ''Mission &amp; History''. Retrieved 2011-10-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17938">[[File:William James b1842c.jpg|thumb|right|190px| [[William James]] (1842-1910) c.1890. With his essay ''The Moral Equivalent of War'' he is considered &lt;ref&gt;Aberkane 2010&lt;/ref&gt; one of the fathers of the concept of '''war against war''']]
In [[political philosophy]] and [[international relations]] especially in [[peace and conflict studies]] the concept of a '''war against war''' also known as '''war on war''' refers to the [[Concretization|reification]] of [[armed conflicts]].

==Origin==
[[File:Berlin plaque Ernst Friedrich.jpg|thumb|left|190px| Memorial plaque for [[Ernst Friedrich]] at the 'Antikriegsmuseum' (anti-war museum) in [[Berlin-Mitte]], Germany. One can read the title of Friedrich's book 'Krieg dem kriege"]]
If a work of [[Edmond Potonié-Pierre]] from 1877 already discusses the idea of reifying conflicts under the title "''la guerre à la guerre''" (''the war against war'')&lt;ref&gt;Edmond Pontonié-Pierre ''La Guerre à la Guerre'' 1877&lt;/ref&gt; in its modern acceptation the concept is formally coined in 1906 by [[William James]] in his essay [[s:The Moral Equivalent of War|''The moral equivalent of war'']]. Though also used as a political slogan, it was a cornerstone of the ideology of both the European pre World War I [[Pacifism#World War I|pacifist]] and [[Anti-war movement#World War I|anti-war]] movements in the 20th century&lt;ref&gt;Francis Ludwig Carsten War against war: British and German radical movements in the First World War, University of California Press 1982&lt;/ref&gt; especially in its German version of ''Kriege dem Kriege'' from the eponymous two volume 1925 pamphlet of Ernst Friedrich&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Friederich, Kriege dem Kriege! 2 vol "Freie Jugend", 1925&lt;/ref&gt; which was largely translated across Europe. Prior to World War I the French labour union ''[[Confédération Générale du Travail]]'' pleaded its pacifism under the slogan ''guerre à la guerre!'' which was also the title of a poster campaign by which the French ''[[Association de la Paix par le Droit]]'' recalled the commitments taken by European powers at the [[Hague Convention of 1907]].&lt;ref&gt;"''Guerre à la Guerre!''" ''campagne d'affichage de l'Association pour la Paix par le Droit'' [https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/15801/DBEE72DCADF6B6D8C648CEDA446023D22AC4CED6.html exemplaire d'une affiche disponible à la Bibliothèque Municipale de Lyon, France]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution in the 20th century==
Although the slogan and concept (as the reification of armed conflicts) of ''war against war'' was the subject of an anti-military pleading in 1916 at the [[military tribunal]] of [[Neuchâtel]]&lt;ref&gt;Jules Humbert-Droz ''Guerre à la guerre: à bas l'armée : plaidoirie complète devant le Tribunal militaire à Neuchâtel le 16 août 1916''&lt;/ref&gt; the concept will also be developed by the [[French military]] with General [[Alexandre Percin]], then War Minister, dedicating a comprehensive study to the subject entitled ''Guerre à la Guerre''.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandre Percin, ''Guerre à la Guerre'' Paris: Montaigne 1927&lt;/ref&gt; The latter work, which especially explores the [[Military operation|operational]] and [[Military strategy|strategic]] dimension of the concept from the angle of [[military doctrine]] would become a seminal contribution to its academic establishment. At times defended by the [[Socialist International]] as in the 1923 discourse of labour unionist [[Edo Fimmen]] at the international congress for peace at the Hague&lt;ref&gt;Edo Fimmen, discours prononcé par Edo Fimmen au Congrès international pour la paix La Haye, du 10 au 15 décembre 1922''Guerre à la guerre: la tâche du prolétariat organisé dans le mouvement pour la paix mondiale''&lt;/ref&gt; the concept will remain politically neutral overall in the 20th century, being also claimed by the [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic movement]] with Gérard Marier and Jean Godin considering [[nuclear disarmament]] a central contribution to the war on war as a [[Christian]] mission&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Marier, Jean Godin, ''Guerre à la guerre: le catholique devant la folie nucléaire'' Paris 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary evolution==
[[File:Jean-Jacques Lebel (2008).png|thumb|right|200px|Jean-Jacques Lebel in 2008, in 1982 the poet took part in the collective work of UNESCO "''War on war; poets of the world at Unesco''" along with Allen Ginsberg.]]
[[File:Allen ginsberg 675.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Allen Ginsberg, 1979]]

===Unesco===
The [[UNESCO|United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] which constitution&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=15244&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html constitution de l'UNESCO, signée le 16 novembre 1945, en vigueur le 4 novembre 1946]&lt;/ref&gt; declares "''That since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed''" describing a [[Memetics|memetical]] conception of war, brought together - in 1982 - thirteen poets for a collective work entitled "''War on war : The poet's cry''". &lt;ref&gt; Lebel, Jean Jacques; Adonis; Ai Qing; Breytenbach, Breyten; Cardenal, Ernesto; Cortez, Jayne; Faye, Jean Pierre; Ginsberg, Allen; Tan'si, Sony Labou; Mello, Thiago de; Pritam, Amrita; Shiraishi, Kazuko; Voznesenski, Andrei '' War on war; poets of the world at Unesco''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aberkane &amp; Goldstein and a peace [[positivism]]===
More recently the concept was discussed by scholars [[Joshua Goldstein]]&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Goldstein ''Winning the War on War: The Decline of Armed Conflict'' Worldwide Foreign Affairs, November/December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Idriss Aberkane]].&lt;ref&gt;Idriss Aberkane ''On the "war on war" in modern geopolitics'' e-international relations January 9th 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As Aberkane defines it "''it permits us to ask, before the war disease reaches its terminal phase, "has man domesticated war, or has war domesticated man?"''". Based on the paradigm of [[Humberto Maturana]] and [[Francisco Varela]] for the description of autonomy and the works of [[Idries Shah]] in [[group psychology]] Aberkane's discussion of the concept consists of considering armed conflicts [[Autopoiesis|autopoietic]] and therefore [[dissipative system]]s which are [[Parasitism|parasitic]] and comparable to [[Richard Dawkins]]' notion of [[selfish gene theory|selfish gene]] hence "''selfish wars''".&lt;ref&gt;Aberkane 2012, ibid&lt;/ref&gt; Conceptually Aberkane argues for a prescriptive use of peace and conflict studies, especially in a study on the defusing of the [[History of Xinjiang#Continued tensions|tensions in Xinjiang]]&lt;ref&gt;Aberkane, Idriss "''Yin or Yang: China and the Muslim World''" e-International Relations, 29 avril 2011, §4&lt;/ref&gt; by which he defends the logical soundness of the concept of a "war against war" in five points:
* (i) "''the qualitative complexity of the notion of [[National interest|interest]] (e.g. What you may think is not your interest may be in a broader perspective)''"
* (ii) "''the non-refuted possibility that external [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interests]] may be internalized within one single interest,''"
* (iii)"'' the fact that [[Hilbert's sixth problem]] has not been solved (ie physical reality is not axiomatized) which implies that''"
* (iv) "''while [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|limitation theorems]] can be demonstrated in [[first order logic]] (and [[game theory]]) there can be no limitation theorem predicating upon physical reality which comprises the notion of interest, thus in particular''"
* (v) "''the impossibility of the total interest of peace ie. the stable intersection of individual and collective peace in international relations cannot be demonstrated.''"
What Aberkane thus describes as "''erenologic positivism''" is transcribed in game theoretical vocabulary as that in international relations "''it is also not proven that a [[Pareto optimality|Pareto-optimal]] situation at the world level (or at a less formal level of describing diplomatic reality, a situation that may be reminiscent to the latter without its mathematical precision) could not be also overlapping with the [[Nash equilibrium]] of interacting individual interests.''"&lt;ref&gt;Aberkane, Ibid 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace–industrial complex===
{{Further information|Peace–industrial complex}}
At least two approaches to the '''war against war''' may be distinguished, the frontal opposition to war or [[Anti-war movement]] on the one side and the transcendent, post-war conception of [[William James]]' 'Moral Equivalent of war' positing, in the way of the [[UNESCO]], that the only way to end conflicts is to make Humanity busy with more fascinating endeavors than wars. In his Nobel acceptance speech [[Martin Luther King]] further underlined that idea which would become the basis of the transcendentist school (e.g. Aberkane):

{{cquote| We will not build a peaceful world by following a negative path. It is not enough to say "We must not wage war." It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace. There is a fascinating little story that is preserved for us in Greek literature about [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] and the [[Siren (mythology)|Sirens]]. The Sirens had the ability to sing so sweetly that sailors could not resist steering toward their island. Many ships were lured upon the rocks, and men forgot home, duty, and honor as they flung themselves into the sea to be embraced by arms that drew them down to death. Ulysses, determined not to be lured by the Sirens, first decided to tie himself tightly to the mast of his boat, and his crew stuffed their ears with wax. But finally he and his crew learned a better way to save themselves: they took on board the beautiful singer [[Orpheus]] whose melodies were sweeter than the music of the Sirens. When Orpheus sang, who bothered to listen to the Sirens? &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1964/king-lecture.html Martin Luther King, Nobel Lecture, Dec. 11th 1964]&lt;/ref&gt; }}

[[File:Martin Luther King, Jr..jpg|thumb|right|200px| Official picture of Martin Luther King Jr. at the Nobel Foundation, 1964]]

Various scholars (Suter 1986, Aberkane 2012, Roberts 2009) and politicians (Seiberling 1972) have thus advocated that peace profiteering should simply be made palatably larger than any possible [[war profiteering]], thus transcending the war against war. However, the first generations of Peace-Industrial scholars have advocated frontal opposition to the [[military–industrial complex]] rather than its transcendent, voluntary metamorphosis into a globally benevolent yet very profitable peace-industrial complex.

[[File:John F. Seiberling 93rd Congress 1973.jpg|thumb|right|200px| US. Rep. John F. Seiberling circa the time of his 1972 address to the Congress calling for a Peace-industrial complex]]

In 1986 [[Keith Suter|Keith D. Suter]] defended his Ph.D dissertation on ''Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex'',&lt;ref&gt;Suter, K. D.  Creating the political will necessary for achieving multilateral disarmament : the need for a peace-industrial complex, Ph.D Thesis, Deakin University, Victoria, 1986 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kwAcNQAACAAJ&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; which was further cited in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;Summy, R. Salla, M.E 'Why the Cold War Ended: A Range of Interpretations' Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995 p.202&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a Peace-industrial complex had already been introduced as early as in 1969 in the U.S. Senate Committee on Government Operations.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Congress. Senate. Committee on Government Operations, U.S. Government Printing Office, 1969 p.147 [https://books.google.com/books?id=RJ83AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZNSIUYLxH8aM0AWzzIHICw&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwCQ]&lt;/ref&gt; The original quote affirmed direct opposition to the military-industrial complex and was therefore not transcendent in nature: "It is time for the United States to break the Huge military-industrial complex and begin in its stead a people and peace-industrial complex". It received further citation throughout the 1970s. The notion appeared in the [[United States Congress House Committee on Science and Astronautics]], Subcommittee on Science, Research, and Development in 1972 &lt;ref&gt;National science policy and priorities act of 1972: Hearings, Ninety-second Congress, second session U.S. Govt. Print. Off., 1972 p.153 [https://books.google.com/books?id=kXsqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwADgK]&lt;/ref&gt;  in a congressional address by US [[John F. Seiberling|Rep. J. F. Seiberling]] (1972) &lt;ref&gt;Rep. J. F. Seiberling, "The case for economic conversion" Congressional record v.118, n°95, 13 June 1972, pp E6177-6179, cited in Science Policy Reviews, Volumes 4 à 5 Battelle Memorial Institute, 1972 p. 398 [https://books.google.com/books?id=ggQFAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CDoQ6AEwAjgK], see also Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the US Congress, Volume 118, Part 16 U.S. Government Printing Office, 1972 p.20738 [https://books.google.com/books?id=G20Udh7ynykC&amp;q=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;dq=%22Peace-Industrial+Complex%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zdeIUc3mB-210QWkg4CIBw&amp;ved=0CE0Q6AEwBjgK]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suter further defended that "each country create a national Ministry for Peace",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i4pinternational.org/files/202/7.+national+ministries+for+peace.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; which was contemporary to the creation of the Ministry for Peace Australia (MFPA) initiative and the Global Alliance for Ministries &amp; Infrastructures for Peace (GAMIP). An Education for a Peace Industrial Complex conference (EPIC) is also mentioned in a 1984 issue of the Nuclear Times.&lt;ref&gt;Nuclear Times, Volumes 3 to 4, 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

If Kofi J. Roberts &lt;ref&gt;Roberts K. J. The Sargasso Bridge, iUniverse 2009 p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly called for the substitution of a military-industrial complex by a peace industrial complex which would enable the focusing on federal spendings on construction rather than destruction, Idriss J. Aberkane further defended the transcendent approach to the peace-industrial complex by calling it the "military-industrial complex 2.0" and thus neither the enemy nor the political complement to the military industrial complex but rather its natural, inevitable evolution on the account that investors (either institutional or private) will inevitably realize the larger profitability of construction over destruction. Aberkane also advocates the political viability of a peace-industrial complex by declaring that in the 21st century, what he calls "weapons of mass construction" will grant much larger political leverage, leadership and [[soft power]] than weapons of mass destruction.

{{cquote| every time a military technology makes it to civilian use it changes the world for good and what it brings you is love rather than hatred, for if you project destruction you're gonna be hated, if you project construction, you're gonna be loved. So what is power, truly, what is a [[superpower]]? Is it a nation that has [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]]? No it is not! Many nations have weapons of mass destruction they are not all superpowers (...) when you're looking at [[The Pentagon]] you're looking at a [[Military budget of the United States|budget]] of 740 billion US dollars, that's the budget of the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] plus de [[Expenditures in the United States federal budget#Discretionary spending|discretionary budget]] that is allocated to Research and Development for defense. I'm not saying we should take it away from the Pentagon, I say we should move to the Pentagon 2.0. For so far, what has America gained in projecting every bits of these dollars? Every time America uses these dollars is it more loved? Is it more respected? Is it safer? Is it more trusted? Does it have more leadership? (...) America could project this money to gain love, respect, leadership and political power. This, is the military-industrial complex 2.0. [It] will be interested in weapons of mass construction rather than weapons of mass destruction because these weapons are the future in terms of power. For what was the power of the 20th century? In the 20th century power was [[Nuclear winter|the ability to go from a beautiful blue planet to a red one]]. If you could turn a blue planet into a red one you were powerful. We have the technology to do that, these (sic) are called weapons of mass construction. Do we have the technology to go the other way around? Can we [[Terraforming|turn a red planet - Mars in that case - into a beautiful green planet]]? We can't but when you're looking at a budget of seven hundred billions US dollars you can look into that. This is gonna be 21st century power, weapons of mass construction. Why? because if you project these weapons I guarantee you people are gonna love you }} &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XLIzupsfiV8 Aberkane, Bring on the Peace-Industrial Complex, Wikistage Paris 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hydro power''' is generated when the natural force from the water's current moves a device (fan, propeller, wheel) that is pushed by the force of the water. Ordinary water weighs 8.36 lbs per gallon (1 kg per liter).{{CN|date=February 2015}} The force make the turbine mechanism spin, creating electricity.

'''Water supply and women in developing countries''' is a complex topic, as lack of accessible, sufficient, clean and affordable [[water supply]] has adverse impacts specifically related to women in [[Developing country|developing nations]]. In most countries, women are the primary household members responsible for providing water for domestic consumption.&lt;ref name=UNWATER&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/EGM_report.pdf, Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], UN-DESA and UN-DCP, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of water, which may take up to six hours a day to meet the household needs, is a duty often relegated to women and children. This foregone time often prevents children, especially girls, from attending school and women from pursuing small business opportunities.&lt;ref name=Water&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1021/es072435t, "Water and Sanitization in Developing Countries: Including Health in the Equation"],  Maggie A Montgomery and Menachem Elimelech, Yale University, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the Second World Water Forum in The Hague concluded that women are the primary users of domestic water, that women used water in their key food production roles, and that women and children were the most vulnerable to water-related disasters.&lt;ref name="Women and Water"&gt;[https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/public/Feb05.pdf, "Women and Water"], UN Division for the Advancement of Women, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; At the International Conference on Water and the Environment, the [[Dublin Statement|Dublin Statement on Water and Sustainable Development]] included "Women Play a central part in the provision management and safeguarding of water" as one of 4 principles. Many women's rights and water advocacy organizations have identified water privatization as an area of concern, sometimes alleging negative effects that specifically affect women.&lt;ref name=Diverting&gt;[http://www.wedo.org/wp-content/uploads/divertingtheflow.pdf,  "Diverting the Flow: A Resource Guide to Gender, Rights and Water Privatization"], Women's Environment and Development Organization.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="Gender, Water, and Sanitization"&gt;[https://www.un.org/esa/sustdev/inter_agency/gender_water/policybrief.pdf, "Gender, Water, and Sanitization"], UN Water Policy Brief, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inclusion of women and the efficacy of water supply==
[[File:India - Sights &amp; Culture - 33 - woman fetching water.jpg|thumb|A woman walking a long distance fetching water in India]]
Water supply schemes in developing nations have shown higher success when planned and run with full participation of women in the affected communities.&lt;ref name="Gender in Water Resource Management"&gt;, Van Wijk-Sijbesma, Christine, 1998. Gender in Water Resources Management, Water Supply and Sanitation: Roles and Realities.&lt;/ref&gt; A study including 88 communities in 14 countries showed that projects where men and women from intended user households were included in selection of site facilities, and where water projects were initiated by user households, rather than by external agencies or local leaders, achieved a final higher access to services than those that did not.&lt;ref name="WSP"&gt;[http://www.wsp.org/wsp/sites/wsp.org/files/publications/global_plareport.pdf, "Linking Sustainability with Demand,Gender and Poverty"], International Water and Sanitation Centre, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==
===Chile===
Chilean law does not specifically include a gender component relating to water projects, but notes that all water projects must assess impact on the "lives and customs of human groups".&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt; A study commissioned in 2000 by the Direccion General de Aguas relating to gender and the challenges of water resources noted: {{quote|text=All government institutions dealing with water resources have a very low percentage of women at the planning and decision-making levels. In stakeholder associations, their percentage in decision-making functions is even lower because women seldom participate in this kind of organisation. A sample study of water rights shoed that 16 percent of these rights belong to women. In the rural areas, the gender balance in water management is somewhat better, especially in the Indian territories. The current average percentage of women presidents in the rural zones is almost 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Direccion General de Aguas, Maria Angelica Algeria, Ingeniera Jefa Area de Evaluacion de Recursos Hidricos, Chile (this quote does not seem to be from a publication and the publication from which it has been quoted should be added)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Uganda ===

The 1995 Constitution of the [[Republic of Uganda]], Article 33 [2] states "The State shall provide the facilities and opportunities necessary to enhance the welfare of women to enable them to realise their full potential and advancement".&lt;ref name=ugandaconstitution&gt;[http://www.uganda.at/Geschichte/verfassung_der_republik_Uganda_2008.pdf, The Constitution of the Republic of Uganda], 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of this outlined responsibility, though excluded from official water statutes, has been addressed in the National Gender Policy, National Water Policy, and the Local Government Act. The National Gender Policy lays out a framework for gender-oriented sectoral policy in development. The National Water Policy calls for the inclusion of women at all stages of implementation, noting that "women and men should have equal opportunities to participate fully in all aspects of community management".&lt;ref name=genderwater&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/Gender_Perspectives_Policies.pdf, "The Gender and Water Development Report 2003"], The Gender and Water Alliance.&lt;/ref&gt; The local government act requires 30% of the representation on local councils to be women, currently at around 10%.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

=== Kenya ===
[[Kenya]]'s "Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resource Management" addresses the issue of gender and water source:
{{quote|text=As women play an important role in provision,  management and safeguarding of water, particular attention will be placed on adequately incorporating and representing gender considerations in water resource management. The issues will be addressed from two perspectives: facilitating the participation and involvement of both sexes in water resource management; and the access(benefits) of both sexes in availability of water.|sign=Department of Water Management |source=Country Strategy on Integrated Water Resources Management, Section IV. Sectoral Analysis and Policy Recommendations. Poverty and Sustainable Livelihoods.}} The text itself is slighted by critics as not referring to equitable participation and division of workload, as well as benefits. However the Kenyan Women's Bureau has begun to cooperate with the Water Department on these matters, through a focus on environmental management, poverty alleviation, and gender.&lt;ref name=genderwater/&gt;

===Malawi===
In [[Malawi]], a group of men managing community water sources was found to be ineffective as they were often absent during the workday. A management group consisting only of women was set up to replace the men, and water supply was reported to have improved. However the burden was too much for the female-only group and communities now split the work with an equitable share of duties.&lt;ref name=MALAWI&gt;Deda, P., Rubian, R., 2004. Women and Biodiversity: The Long Journey from Users to Policy-Makers. Natural Resources Forum, 28(3): 201-204.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in Malawi have also initiative in the maintenance of improved water sources, forming water tap committees composed mostly of women and using the pipelines as footpaths, reporting leaks to the village caretaker.&lt;ref name=WORLDBANK1&gt;World Bank, 1996. Toolkit on Gender in Water and Sanitation&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender and capacity development==
In scaling down water projects to the individual level, women have been found to be effective teachers at a domestic levels, and gender-sensitive approaches to water and [[sanitation]] have proven to be cost effective.&lt;ref name=GENDERPERSPECTIVE&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/bground_2.pdf, "A Gender Perspective on Water Resources and Sanitation"], Interagency Task Force on Gender and Water, United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs&lt;/ref&gt; In the Eastern Development Region in Nepal,   a small scale water management project under a "Community Water and Sanitation Programme" has shown success in a women-led team, which manages 23 tap stands in a village of the ''Jhapa''' district in addition to running adult literacy programs and latrine construction.&lt;ref name=NEPAL2&gt;Mahapatra, K., 1996. Towards Empowerment:  Women Mobilizers in the Community Water Supply and Sanitation Programme in Nepal. Waterfront,  9:12-13, 18-19.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[El Salvador]], The "Watersheds and Gender Project" has taught women technical agricultural knowledge, promoted women as trainers, and fostered female participation in positions previously uniquely occupied by men.&lt;ref name=ELSAVADOR&gt;Agua Project Report, 2002. El Salvador: AGUA Project Evaluation August–September 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

== Access ==
Access problems relating to water involve long walking distance to the source, low water quality, lack of a sufficient quantity of water, high water prices and poor system design. Women often suffer disproportionately from these problems. In [[Ghana]], women and children suffer as the result of failed water supply schemes where women consumed unclean water to save money to feed children.&lt;ref name="Ghana"&gt;[http://bscw.ihe.nl/pub/bscw.cgi/d2221893/AmengaEtagoWaterPrivatisationinGhana.pdf, "Water Privatization in Ghana: Womens Rights Under Siege"], Rudolf Amenga-Etego, Coordinator, Advocacy And Campaign Programmes, Integrated Social Development Centre, Accra-Ghana.&lt;/ref&gt; In east [[Nepal]] tap stands and tube wells were located along roads, so that women had to travel long distances or wait until nightfall to avoid being seen by men while bathing freely or washing clothes.&lt;ref name=eastNepal&gt;Regmi, S.C., Fawcett, B., 1999. Integrating Gender Needs Into Drinking Water Projects in Nepal. Gender and Development, 7(3): 62-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health effects ==
[[File:Schistosomiasis itch.jpeg|thumb|A hand showing [[schistosomiasis]] itch]]
Health and access are often related in gender-related issues of water sourcing. In [[Tanzania]], urinary [[schistosomiasis]] among women and girls was associated with the local practice of washing clothes in water infested with the vectors for the disease. As part of a project to drill wells the washing of clothes at hand pumps had been banned, forcing women to wash clothes in the open, infested water.&lt;ref name=untapped&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/downloads/untapped_eng.pdf, "Untapped Connections: Gender, Water, and Poverty"], Women's Environment and Development organization.&lt;/ref&gt; Cholera outbreaks are also of concern, as in Alexandra and KwaZulu, [[South Africa]] following contaminated water use which had been linked by some observers to water supply privatization in some localities.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt; In addition, women are often primary caretakers for HIV positive family members who require clean water in treatment, lack thereof can complicate existing effects.&lt;ref name=Diverting /&gt;

==Water and gender in international organizations==
The [[United Nations]] Interagency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE) established the Gender and Water Task Force in 2003. The Task Force has since become a UN-Water Task Force and is taking responsibility for the gender component of International Water for Life Decade (2005-1015).&lt;ref name=UNWEB&gt;[http://www.unwater.org/TFgender.html, UN Water Activities]&lt;/ref&gt; The Task Force has also called for additional empirical data regarding the issue, as "Neither the quality nor type of data currently collected are adequate to the task of supporting gender [[Millennium Development Goal]]s in water and sanitation".&lt;ref name=letter&gt;[http://www.ecosanres.org/pdf_files/Summary%20of%20EGM%20Report%20on%20Gender-disaggregated%20data-lowres.pdf, Summary Report on Gender-Disaggregated Data on Water and Sanitation], 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Bank]] Gender and Development Group has also addressed the issue at an institutional level, citing successful "Gender-Mainstreaming" efforts in many of its Water Supply and Sanitation projects.&lt;ref name=WSG&gt;[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTGENDER/Resources/Water_March07.pdf, "Water, Sanitation and Gender"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Weapon systems engineering''' involves using engineering tools in [[technology]] to create and guarantee the safety and performance of weapons. It is currently being used by the [[military]] and the government to create new weapons to protect the [[United States]]. It is used to make nuclear and non-[[Nuclear weapon|nuclear weapons]] and ensure their safety throughout their lifespan. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nnsa.energy.gov/aboutus/ourprograms/defenseprograms/futurescienceandtechnologyprograms/engineering|title=Engineering|website=NNSA|accessdate=February 15th, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Companies Involved ==
Many companies help our government and military to manufacture new weapons and strategies. One is Parsons. The [[Missile Defense Agency]], MDA, is a research agency that develops and tests the missile defense agency to defend the United States and its allies. Parsons helps with this through the MDA [[missile]] contract. They provide missile system support including tests and evaluating the performance. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.parsons.com/project/weapons-missile-systems-engineering/|title=Weapons and Missile Systems Engineering – Various U.S. Locations - Parsons|work=Parsons|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] awarded multi-million-dollar contracts with Tekla Research and Avian-Precise Co. to support the "[[Naval Air Systems Command|Naval Air Systems]] Command's Systems Engineering Department". Tekla is to help NAVAIR assess [[technology]], cost, and design. Avian-Precise is to help the command sustain a weapons system related to all U.S. naval platforms and systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blog.executivebiz.com/2018/02/navy-selects-tekla-research-avian-precise-co-for-navair-systems-engineering-support-idiqs/|title=Navy Selects Tekla Research, Avian-Precise Co. for NAVAIR Systems Engineering Support IDIQs|work=ExecutiveBiz|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inventions ==
The electromagnetic railgun launcher is a new long-range weapon using electricity instead of chemicals to launch projectiles. [[Projectile|Projectiles]] can be launched at approximately 4,500 miles per hour using magnetic fields. These new weapons are allowing the military to eliminate [[Explosive material|explosives]] where possible. It is being used by the Navy as well for its ability to be effective and affordable. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://science.dodlive.mil/2015/02/13/the-future-moves-at-mach-6/|title=The Future Moves at Mach 6|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Navy is working on modernizing their weapons, including nuclear weapons. Two weapons on the list to work on creating are a "low-yield warhead for submarine-launched ballistic missiles" and a "nuclear capable submarine-launched cruise missile". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.defensenews.com/space/2018/02/02/the-us-could-be-getting-2-new-nuclear-capabilities-here-are-the-details/|title=The US could be getting 2 new nuclear capabilities.

The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] is using Weapons Systems Engineering to help protect our soldiers. They have designed a [[Humvee]] to be equipped to contain a gun with an automated tracking system. This would be controlled by another [[soldier]] or a computer program. This along with other new systems, vehicles, etc. is all possible because of the new advancements in Weapon Systems Engineering. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://taskandpurpose.com/army-wingman-autonomous-vehicle-program/|title=The Army Is Finally Engineering A Wingman Who Won’t Screw Soldiers Over|last=Keller|first=Jared|date=2018-02-14|work=Task &amp; Purpose|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May the Army will test out automated Humvee's to certify them as combat ready vehicles. According to the Army Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center (TARDEC) this is the first step toward weaponized robotics. The Army is not looking to make killing machines, but machines controlled by humans. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.meritalk.com/articles/army-ready-to-certify-armed-robotic-wingman-vehicles-for-combat/|title=Army Ready to Certify Armed, Robotic ‘Wingman’ Vehicles for Combat – MeriTalk|website=www.meritalk.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Air Force|US Air Force]] Research Lab (AFRL) assigned [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Martain]] the job of creating "an aircraft-mounted high-power fibre laser". They must make a weapon that is small enough and light enough, but also can be effective. The laser will be mounted on jet fighters with the ability to disable enemies targeting systems. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.airforce-technology.com/features/agents-shield-us-air-forces-new-aircraft-mounted-laser-weapon/|title=Agents of SHiELD – the US Air Force’s new aircraft-mounted laser weapon - Airforce Technology|date=2018-02-19|work=Airforce Technology|access-date=2018-02-24|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
