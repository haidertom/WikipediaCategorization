In the [[music industry]], a '''360 deal''' (from '''360° deal''') is a business relationship between an artist and a music industry company. The company agrees to provide financial and other support for the artist, including direct advances as well as support in marketing, promotion, touring and other areas. In turn, the artist agrees to give the company a percentage of an increased number of their revenue streams, often including sales of recorded music, live performances, publishing and more. 

This business arrangement is an alternative to the traditional recording contract. In a 360 deal, a company typically provides support to an artist in more areas than covered by a traditional recording contract on the condition of receiving a percentage of revenue from these additional areas. During the first decade of the 21st century, revenues from recorded music fell dramatically and the profit margins traditionally associated with the record industry disappeared. The 360 deal reflects the fact that much of a musician's income now comes from sources other than recorded music, such as live performance and merchandise.

==History==
According to [[Jeff Hanson (music executive)|Jeff Hanson]], head of [[Silent Majority Group]], the first new artist 360° deal was created by Hanson along with attorneys Jim Zumwalt and Kent Marcus, and Jim's partner Orville.&lt;ref name="hitquarters"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |title=Interview with Jeff Hanson |publisher=[[HitQuarters]] |date=September 20, 2010 |accessdate=October 4, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101103105151/http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview%2Fopar%2Fintrview_JeffHanson_Interview_Part2.html |archivedate=November 3, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was submitted to [[Atlantic Records]] for the rock band [[Paramore]] while Hanson, Marcus and Zumwalt were employed by the label. Hanson has said there was strong resistance to the deal by both label and band and that he had to fight to make it happen, but believes his efforts were vindicated by the band's subsequent success, saying: "How else would a label have been patient enough to put the band on three straight [[Warped Tour]]s and down-streamed the band to [[Fueled by Ramen]] all while losing millions of dollars?"&lt;ref name="hitquarters"/&gt;

360 deals have been made by traditional record companies, as in [[Robbie Williams]]'s pioneering deal with [[EMI]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
360° deals have attracted criticism from various quarters. Panos Panay, CEO of online music platform Sonicbids, has said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If you want to find out the future of 360° deals, look at Motown in the late 60s. Motown was the pioneer of a 360° deal ... They owned your likeness, your touring, publishing, record royalties, told you what to wear, told you how to walk … It made for great entertainment but if you look at every one of those artists, what happened? Sooner or later they said, 'I’m not going to go on the road for 200 shows because you tell me so. I’m an artist! I’m a creative person!' Eventually all these artists left ... There’s two things we know about creativity: you can’t force it and you can’t really control it."&lt;ref name="hitquarters.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Panos_Panay_Interview.html |title=Interview With Panos Panay |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Albert Hofstadter''' (March 28, 1910&amp;nbsp;– January 26, 1989) was an [[American philosopher]].

==Life and career==
Hofstadter taught at [[Columbia University]] (1950–67), the [[University of California at Santa Cruz]] (1968–75) and the [[New School for Social Research]] (1976–78).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/28/obituaries/albert-hofstadter-philosopher-78.html?pagewanted=1 "Albert Hofstadter, Philosopher, 78", ''New York Times'', Jan. 28., 1989]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the elder brother of physicist and Nobel laureate [[Robert Hofstadter]] and the uncle of Robert's son, [[Douglas Hofstadter]].

==Thoughts on the later Heidegger==
As a [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger]] scholar, Hofstadter contends that Heidegger is able to shape and use language in keeping with his basic insight that language is the house of Being, i.e., where humans dwell. "It is by staying with the thinking the language itself does that Heidegger is able to rethink, and thus think anew, the oldest, the perennial and perennially forgotten thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, Martin and Albert Hofstadter. "Introduction," ''Poetry, Language, Thought.''. New York: Harper Collins, 1971, pg. xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; One of these is the Being of beings in the sense of [[aletheia]]. Hofstadter praises Heidegger's project to free human beings from alienated ways of relating to [[Object (philosophy)|thing]]s, "letting us find in it a real dwelling place instead of the cold, sterile hostelry in which we presently find ourselves."&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1971, pg. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allyn Bromley''' (born 1928) is an American printmaker and art educator who was born in San Francisco.  She first came to Hawaii in 1952, and subsequently moved to [[Waikiki]], where she lived for nine years.  From 1961-1965, she lived in Europe, returning to Hawaii in 1965.  She received a BFA from the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in 1968 and an MFA from the [[University of Colorado Boulder]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualart.com/Exhibitions/Allyn-Bromley--Finding-Latitude/9680BC60744C7F46#Info Allyn Bromley: Finding Latitude, mutualart.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuern, John David, ''Finding Latitude: The Work of Allyn Bromley'', The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu, 2010, pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her teaching career at [[Leeward Community College]] in 1972, where she taught until 1983.  She became director of the Printmaking Department at the [[University of Hawaii at Manoa]] in 1983, and retired as a [[professor emeritus]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaii.edu/art/people/ University of Hawaii Art Department]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.honoluluacademy.org/making-a-statement-allyn-bromley-on-her-works-green-piece-and-kakaako/ Honolulu Museum of Art blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zuern, John David, ''Finding Latitude: The Work of Allyn Bromley'', The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu, 2010, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Bromley works primarily in [[screen printing]].  Since the late 1980s, she has been combining printing with painting, drawing, and [[Collage|collaging]].&lt;ref&gt;Zuern, John David, ''Finding Latitude: The Work of Allyn Bromley'', The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu, 2010, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Breakfast Buddha'', from 2004, is an example of her mixed-media prints.  As in much of her portrait work, the subject's silhouette is emphasized, and facial details are minimized.&lt;ref&gt;Zuern, John David, ''Finding Latitude: The Work of Allyn Bromley'', The Contemporary Museum, Honolulu, 2010, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Hawaii State Art Museum]] and the [[Honolulu Museum of Art]] are among the public collections holding work by '''Allyn Bromley'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mutualart.com/Exhibitions/Allyn-Bromley--Finding-Latitude/9680BC60744C7F46#Info Allyn Bromley: Finding Latitude, mutualart.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''An Leabhar Breac''' ("Speckled Book"), now less commonly '''Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre''' (The Great Book of Dun Doighre") or possibly erroneously, '''Leabhar Breac Mic Aodhagáin''' ("The Speckled Book of the [[MacEgans]]"),&lt;ref&gt;The Leabhar Breac Mic Aodhagáin is the title of a book cited by [[Geoffrey Keating]] in Book III of ''[[Foras Feasa ar Éirinn]]'', described as an "old book of annals" (''seinleabhar annálach'') and probably now lost. [http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html Irish Script on Screen].&lt;/ref&gt; is a medieval Irish vellum manuscript containing [[Middle Irish]] and [[Hiberno-Latin]] writings. The manuscript is held in the library of the [[Royal Irish Academy]] in Dublin, where it is catalogued as [[Royal Irish Academy|RIA]] MS '''23 P 16''' or '''1230'''.

It was most probably compiled by [[Murchadh Ó Cuindlis|Murchadh (Riabach) Ó Cuindlis]] of Bally Lough Deacker, at Duniry between the years 1408 and 1411. [[Duniry]] — Dún Daighre, Dún Doighre — in eastern [[Clanricarde]] (now east [[County Galway]]) is situated south-east of the town of [[Loughrea]], and in the medieval era was home to a branch of the bardic Clann [[Mac Aodhagáin]] (the MacEgans), who served as brehons for the O'Connors of Clanricarde.

==History==
In the 16th century, the manuscript was in the possession of the Mac Egans of Duniry, hence the older title Leabhar Mór Dúna Doighre. In 1629, when the manuscript was held in the convent of [[Kinalehin Friary|Kinalehin]], County Galway.

It was consulted by [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]], brother of the [[Annals of the Four Masters|Four Masters]], who copied pp.&amp;nbsp;272–7. The book passed into the possession of [[Eamon Ó Ceallaigh]] (Co. Roscommon) in 1732, then of Dr. John O'Brien by 1768 and finally of [[Cornelius O'Daly]] (Mitchelstown, Co. Cork). The [[Royal Irish Academy]] acquired the first volume in 1789, when General [[Charles Vallancey]] purchased it for the academy for 3 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] from Cornelius O'Daly. O'Daly also owned the second volume, which comprises nine leaves, but was unaware that it belonged to the larger volume. In 1789, this volume was acquired by [[Chevalier O'Gorman]], by George Smith of College Green in the next century and by the Academy sometime after 1844. The manuscript is held in the Academy's library in Dublin to this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html Irish Script on Screen].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The manuscript is of a large size, measuring 40.5&amp;nbsp;cm x 28&amp;nbsp;cm, which makes it the largest Irish vellum manuscript to have been written by a single scribe.&lt;ref&gt;Royal Irish Academy, [http://www.ria.ie/library+catalogue/word/Leabhar%20Breac.doc "Leabhar Breac"]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118200919/http://www.ria.ie/library%2Bcatalogue/word/Leabhar%20Breac.doc |date=November 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains 40 [[wikt:folio|folio]]s, which are written in double columns. Capitals are decorated in a simple style, with some letters having been interwoven with zoomorphic patterns and coloured in red, vermilion, yellow and blue. There are two drawings, a flower-like diagram on p.&amp;nbsp;121 and a drawing of the Crucifixion on p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.isos.dias.ie/master.html?http://www.isos.dias.ie/libraries/RIA/RIA_MS_23_P_16/english/index.html the images at ISOS].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==
The manuscript consists almost entirely of religious writings in Latin and [[Middle Irish]]. It includes homiletic ''Lives'' of [[Saint Patrick]], [[Saint Columba]], [[Saint Brigid]], [[Saint Cellach]], and [[Martin of Tours|Saint Martin]], the earliest version of ''[[Félire Óengusso]]'' ("Martyrology of [[Óengus Céile Dé|Óengus]]"), the ''Rule of the Céli Dé'', ''[[Aislinge Meic Con Glinne]]'' ("The Vision of Mac Conglinne"), a version of ''[[Fís Adamnáin]]'' ("The Vision of [[Adamnán]]"), ''[[Saltair na Rann]]'', ''Stair Nicomeid'' ("Gospel of Nicodemus"), ''Amra Choluim Chille'', a [[Marian litany]], and various ecclesiastical legends, hymns, catecheses and homilies. Exceptions to the predominantly religious contents are ''[[Sanas Cormaic]]'' ("Cormac's Glossary") and a history of Philip of Macedon and Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;Peters, E. (ed. and tr.). "Die irische Alexandersage." [[ZCP]] 30 (1967): 71–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Glosses and notes==
The numerous notes which Murchadh Ó Cuindlis jotted into the margins afford us a unique glimpse of the circumstances of the writing process. These range from everyday details like a cat straying about or a robin singing in a beautiful voice to a nearby pillage in [[Lorrha]] by a certain Murchad Ua Madagáin. A persistent object of complaint for the writer is the weather, in particular the cold.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, Leabhar Breac."&gt;O'Neill, "Leabhar Breac."&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the notes, Tomás Ó Concheanainn has been able to reconstruct the time span in which certain sections had been written. For instance, it took the scribe about 6 weeks to write 35 pages (pp.&amp;nbsp;141–75), while some parts proved more challenging, such as a column for a poem with interlinear glosses, which cost him a day.&lt;ref name="O'Neill, Leabhar Breac." /&gt;

'''''Benda Bilili!''''' is a 2010 documentary by [[Renaud Barret]] and [[Florent de La Tullaye]], produced by [[Yves Chanvillard]] and [[Nadim Cheikhrouha]] ([[Screenrunner]]).

The film follows the [[Kinshasa]] [[street musician]] group [[Staff Benda Bilili]], whose core members of the group are disabled due to [[polio]]. "Benda Bilili" means "look beyond appearances" in Lingala.

Renaud Barret and partner Florent de La Tullaye first spotted the group performing on the streets of Kinshasa in 2004. The shooting lasted 5 years until the Staff Benda Bilili became worldwide acclaimed. Amid this larger arc of triumph over adversity, it's Barret and de La Tullaye's joint eye for smaller personal and environmental details that keep the film witty and surprising: the camera captures the social cut-and-thrust of urban Kinshasa, before reflecting the group's wonder at a wider world they previously imagined only in mythic terms. In Benda Bilili!, the sense of discovery between subject and audience is thrillingly mutual.

Benda Bilili! received standing ovations when it opened at the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], with the group in attendance, and performing at the [[Directors' Fortnight]] opening party.&lt;ref name="Peter Culshaw"&gt;{{cite news|last=Culshaw|first=Peter|title=Accidental big-screen heroes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/worldfolkandjazz/8390739/Benda-Bilili-Accidental-big-screen-heroes.html#|accessdate=23 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film opened in American theatres in 2011, although a planned U.S. tour in conjunction with the film had to be canceled due to [[passport]] problems.&lt;ref name="Steve Hochman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hochman|first=Steve|title='Benda Bilili!' documentary details the band's difficult lives|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2011/oct/05/entertainment/la-et-1005-staff-benda-bilili-20111005|accessdate=17 March 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=17 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
A musical documentary depicting the against-all-odds rise of Staff Benda Bilili, a dynamic band of street musicians from the Democratic Republic of Congo who became beloved stars of the world music circuit. Charting the group's progress across several years, Benda Bilili! tells a real-life Cinderella story spanning humble beginnings in Kinshasa and a triumphant European tour.

'''''Black Sea''''' is a 2014 [[submarine films|submarine]] [[Disaster film|disaster]] [[Thriller film|thriller]] film directed by [[Kevin Macdonald (director)|Kevin Macdonald]], written by [[Dennis Kelly]], and starring [[Jude Law]].&lt;ref name="Kevin" /&gt; The film was released in the United Kingdom on 5 December 2014, and in the United States on 23 January 2015.&lt;ref name="release" /&gt;

==Plot==
Robinson ([[Jude Law]]), a veteran captain of under-sea salvage who is recently divorced and estranged from his young son, receives news that he is to be made redundant. His employer gives him £8,640 severence pay and he is asked to clean out his desk and leave the premises immediately.

Later, while having a drink with some former colleagues, Robinson meets up with his friend Kurston and a Russian called Blackie ([[Konstantin Khabensky]]). Kurston informs the duo of an idea to make money. He tells them about a German [[German Type VII submarine#Type VIIC|Type VIIC]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;Based on Robinson studying plans for the ''[[German submarine U-651|U-651]]'' to prepare for the expedition&lt;/ref&gt; [[U-boat]] from [[World War II]] that sank off the coast of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] with a cargo of gold worth millions and how their former employer found the U-boat's location but was unable to salvage it due to the [[Russo-Georgian War]]. He also informs them both of a plan he has been working on to secretly recover the gold. After meeting with Kurston, Robinson agrees to meet with an unknown backer called Lewis.

Lewis agrees to fund Robinson's expedition on the grounds he receives a 40% split of the proceeds up to $40 million, a 20% cut on any amount above that, and that his executive Daniels ([[Scoot McNairy]]) accompany the expedition. Robinson agrees to the deal. Upon returning home Robinson finds a youth, Tobin, who notifies him of Kurston's suicide and indicates they were friends. Robinson takes the young man in and decides to bring him along on the expedition, and acquires a {{sclass-|Foxtrot|submarine}} from the [[Port of Sevastopol]]. The crew is 50% Russian and 50% British and almost immediately there are issues between the two groups. Only Blackie speaks Russian and English and the Russians view the young Tobin as a bad omen, mistakenly assuming he is a virgin when he is in fact an expecting father.

Due to the close confines, tension begins to mount between the two crews. Robinson makes the decision to split the take equally between each crewman. Due to the mounting pressures the crew fall out and there is a fight leading to Fraser ([[Ben Mendelsohn]]) losing his head and stabbing and killing Blackie. In the ensuing scuffle a fire breaks out and the sub is damaged leading to an explosion which knocks Robinson unconscious and kills at least 2 men.

Robinson wakes up 18 hours later to find tensions at breaking point. The Russians have taken over half of the boat with the British in the other half. The vessel is also badly damaged and they have no means to speak with the Russians as Blackie was killed. The sub's drive shaft is damaged but they discover they are close to the old U-boat and may be able to transfer its drive shaft and save the boat. Tensions continue to mount but Robinson discovers Morozov ([[Grigoriy Dobrygin]]) speaks English.

Robinson sends Tobin with Fraser and another diver to recover the drive-shaft and the gold. While making their way back, the third diver ([[David Threlfall]]) perishes when his air hose gets cut. Through Morozov they manage to get the Russians to install the drive-shaft and get the sub moving again. At this stage Daniels admits to Robinson that his prior employer set them up such that they are being used to do the dangerous work, while the employer waits to seize the gold as soon as the submarine surfaces. Robinson then decides to remain submerged and travel to Turkey, to try to keep the gold and avoid arrest. Furthermore, he decides they will attempt a risky navigation through a narrow channel, against the wishes of the crew.  Meanwhile Daniels persuades Fraser to murder Zaytsev thus forcing Robinson's hand, since there are no longer enough men to safely operate the sub.  At this point a second fire and explosion sends the sub back to the seafloor, and the sub begins to take on water.

Fraser and the rest of the remaining crew try to repair the leaks but their efforts are futile. Before they can escape, a panicked Daniels locks the bulkhead behind him leaving three men to drown but traps himself in the next compartment with his snagged clothing. Morozov closes the final bulkhead, leaving Daniels to drown and protecting Robinson, Tobin, and himself in the torpedo section where Robinson has hidden three [[Submarine Escape Immersion Equipment|escape suits]]. Robinson evacuates Tobin and Morozov and explains to Tobin that he will follow in the third suit using an emergency lever. Both men surface whereupon Morozov informs the young Tobin that there was no emergency lever and that Robinson had chosen to sacrifice himself. Soon after the third suit appears containing some of the gold and a picture of Robinson's family.

==Release==
''Black Sea'' was released on 5 December 2014, in British cinemas. It had a limited release in the US on 23 January 2015.&lt;ref name=release&gt;{{cite news|last1=D'ALESSANDRO|first1=ANTHONY|title=Focus Features To Bow ‘Black Sea’ In January|url=http://www.deadline.com/2014/07/insidious-chapter-3-black-sea-selfless-focus-features-release-dates/|accessdate=3 July 2014|publisher=deadline.com|date=2 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 130 reviews, with an average rating of 6.4/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "''Black Sea'' may not be particularly deep, but thanks to Kevin Macdonald's judicious direction and a magnetic performance from Jude Law, it remains an efficiently well-crafted thriller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/black_sea/ |title=Black Sea (2016)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 62 out of 100, based on reviews from 33 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/black-sea|title=Black Sea Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about its influences from ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' and ''[[Sorcerer (film)|Sorcerer]]'', [[Mark Kermode]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' said, "While it may not rival the films to which it alludes, this remains a convincingly muscular genre piece with plenty of dramatic clout."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/dec/07/black-sea-review-jude-law-kevin-macdonald-submarine-thriller|title=Black Sea review – Jude Law gets into deep water in a leaky Soviet sub|last=Kermode|first=Mark|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 December 2014|accessdate=30 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Edward Anthony and Frank Buck.jpg|thumb|right|Co-authors Anthony (left) and Buck signing copies of the follow-up book, ''[[Wild Cargo (book)|Wild Cargo]]'' (1932)]]
'''''Bring ‘Em Back Alive''''' is a 1930 book by [[Frank Buck (animal collector)|Frank Buck]]. His first book, it was a huge best seller that catapulted him to world fame and was translated into many languages. Buck tells of his adventures capturing exotic animals. 
Writing with [[Edward Anthony (writer)|Edward Anthony]], Buck relates some of his most frightening experiences, among them, his battle with an escaped king cobra. This venomous snake is the only jungle animal, Buck says, that has no fear of either man or beast. "Nowhere in the world is there an animal or reptile that can quite match its unfailing determination to wipe out
anything that crosses its path. This lust to kill invests the king cobra with a quality of fiendishness that puts it in a class by itself, almost making it a jungle synonym for death." When the escaped king cobra confronted him, Buck wrote, for an instant, mind and body were numb. He stripped off the white duck jacket he wore over his bare skin and as the snake struck he lunged forward, threw himself with the coat in front of him upon it and hit the ground with a bang, with the cobra, trapped in the jacket under him.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: Bebaclassics.jpg|thumb|left|220px|[[Classics Illustrated]] edition.]] --&gt;

Buck describes many other fearsome encounters. A [[tapir]] he was trying to medicate made a sudden terrific charge, hitting him in the stomach with its head and knocking him down. Then the enraged beast jumped on him, pounded him with its hind legs, and dragged him around its pen. The tapir was trying to rip off Buck’s face with its huge jaws and powerful teeth when Buck's native helpers came running to his rescue. One of them shoved a two-by-four plank down the animal's throat, allowing Buck to escape.

“The book can be recommended to anybody who likes being made to sit on the edge of
his chair and gasp for breath as his eyes eat up the print to see what happens next,” wrote the New York Times Book Review.&lt;ref&gt;[[Florence Finch Kelly]]. Bring ‘Em Back Alive. ''New York Times Book Review''. December 14, 1930.&lt;/ref&gt; Many decades later, these remarkable stories have lost none of their pace or their power to thrill.

War correspondent [[Floyd Gibbons]] suggested to Buck that he write a book about his experiences. Mutual friends introduced Buck to [[George T. Bye]], a New York literary agent, who represented Buck in the publication of ''Bring 'Em Back Alive'' and Buck's subsequent books.

In 2000, [[Steven Lehrer]] published a new collection of these stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''conservation scientist''' is a museum professional who works in the field of [[Conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] and whose focus is on the research of [[cultural heritage]] (e.g. art, artifacts, buildings, and monuments) through scientific inquiry. Conservation scientists conduct applied scientific research and techniques to determine the material, chemical, and technical aspects of cultural heritage. The technical information conservation scientists gather is then used by [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]] and [[curators]] to decide the most suitable [[conservation-restoration|conservation]] treatments for the examined object and/or adds to our knowledge about the object by providing answers about the material composition, fabrication, authenticity, and previous restoration treatments.

==Responsibilities and duties==
The main responsibility of a conservation scientist is to provide analytical and technical support for the preservation and restoration of cultural objects using scientific analysis and techniques.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Whitmore, P. (Eds.). (2005). [http://mac.mellon.org/NSF-MellonWorkshop/Whitmore%20White%20paper.pdf Conservation Science Research: Activities, Needs, and Funding Opportunities]. (A Report to the National Science Foundation). Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  These tasks are accomplished primarily in four ways: 1.) the identification of materials and fabrication of an object, 2.) studying the degradation mechanisms of the objects, 3.) developing and testing conservation-restoration treatments, and 4.) developing and testing new analytical techniques and equipment. Each task is properly documented by conservation scientists with such information as composition, condition, history, and suggested treatments.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Additionally, many of these tasks require conservation scientists to collaborate with other museum professionals and industrial/mainstream scientists in order to properly accomplish them, in particular with conservators and curators (see Related positions).

===Identification===
[[File:IMA Conservation Scientist using Raman spectroscopy 1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Conservation scientist using [[Raman spectroscopy]] at the Indianapolis Museum of Art.]]
The identification of an object’s component materials is the most basic of conservation science tasks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  This is typically accomplished using non-destructive examination techniques or, if necessary, destructive analytical techniques designed for small samples (see Instruments and uses). The information yielded about the object’s material composition aids in the development of preventive conservation measures- such as lighting and humidity controls-and the selection of appropriate restoration treatments. The analysis of materials can also lead to discoveries about the object’s origin and fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (2013). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such studies, called technical art history, can provide insight into the time period of an object, its authenticity, the artist, and previous restoration treatments. In addition to leading to new interpretations, this information impacts the selection of treatments by conservators and conservation scientists.

===Degradation===
Another key focus of conservation science is studying the degradation or deterioration mechanism of objects. Using chemical analysis, conservation scientists can determine the underlying material processes (i.e. aging and chemical reactions), risk factors, and environmental conditions causing the objects to degrade.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;The Getty Conservation Institute. (2013) [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/about/science/ Science Department]. Retrieved April 13, 2104.&lt;/ref&gt;  This information can then be used by conservation scientists, in collaboration with conservators, to develop appropriate treatments for objects, in particular treatments that can provide long-term stability and preservation for the examined object.

===Development of conservation-restoration treatments===
The continuing development of new conservation materials (e.g. cleaning solvents) and techniques is an essential aspect of the conservation of cultural heritage. This research ensures the continued existence of cultural heritage in the best condition possible considering their age and degradation. Conservators often rely on conservation scientists for their scientific knowledge and skills in the development of these materials and treatments. Conservation scientists are asked to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of current materials and treatments, to improve those material/techniques, and to devise new materials and techniques.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The goal is to develop conservation treatments and materials that can slow the degradation of materials and further damage effectively and without harming the object.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Development of new analytical techniques and equipment===
In addition to developing conservation treatments and materials, conservation scientists collaborate with industrial scientists and instrument manufactures in the development of new analytical techniques and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art. (n.d.). [http://www.imamuseum.org/research/conservation-science Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Conservation scientists are constantly looking for and developing new techniques and instruments that improve the condition and treatment of objects. To this end, scientists are developing new techniques and instruments to: decrease and eliminate the need for sampling objects to minimize collateral damage, better analyze materials, document results, improve ease (e.g. portability), improve environmental monitoring.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Education===
In addition to their scientific responsibilities, conservation scientists have a duty to help educate new conservations scientists, the conservation field, and the public as part of their ethical code.&lt;ref&gt;(AIC. (1994). [http://www.conservation-us.org/about-us/core-documents/code-of-ethics#.U1WY6I1OUeE Core Documents: Code of Ethics]. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  To ensure the continuation and quality of their profession, conservation scientists are involved in the training of new conservation scientists as members in academic conservation departments, adjunct faculty, and as mentors to those in fellowships, internships, and entry-level jobs.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  Conservation scientists also help educate the conservation community at large by disseminating their research to promote the growth and use of the best conservation practices and materials. Lastly, conservation scientists educate the public about conservation science to promote awareness of about the field and its importance to the preservation of our cultural heritage.

==Knowledge, abilities, and skills==
The basic knowledge, skills, and abilities needed by conservation scientists are:
*advance knowledge in a physical or applied science discipline (e.g. physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology)
*basic knowledge of conservation and relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. art history, archaeology, anthropology, history, fine arts, etc.)
*critical thinking and creative problem solving
*the ability to formulate and carry out research&lt;ref&gt;EPISCON. (1999). [http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/ Bologna document] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140421220515/http://www.episcon.scienze.unibo.it/episcon/ |date=2014-04-21 }}. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*experience using a broad range of analytical techniques and equipment (see Instrumentation and uses)
*the ability to collaborate and work in a team
*the ability to communicate effectively

==Instrumentation and uses==
[[File:IMA Conservation Science Lab.JPG|thumb|right|500px|Indianapolis Museum of Art Conservation Science Laboratory.]]
Conservation scientists use a variety of microscopic, spectroscopic, chromatographic, and other scientific techniques and instruments to physically and chemically examine objects.&lt;ref&gt;Indianapolis Museum of Art. (n.d.). [http://www.imamuseum.org/research/conservation-science/instrumentation Instrumentation]. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Non-destructive techniques are favored by conservation scientists so to preserve the originality, integrity, and current state of the object as much as possible. Such non-destructive methods include visual examination, advanced imaging techniques, and X-rays.&lt;ref&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (n.d.). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 19, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Sometimes, sampling an object is unavoidable. In these cases, microscopic fragments are removed from the object- rarely visible to the naked eye- and their original location is documented. The scientific and ethical demands of a conservation scientist require a variety of instruments- taken from mainstream science and slightly modified- in order to conduct their research properly. Listed below are some of the most commonly used instruments in museum laboratories today and how they are used by conservation scientists.

'''Microscopic:'''

==Education and training==
There is much discussion and debate in the field of conservation science about the amount and type of education and training that should be required for people entering the field. Currently, there is no one set path to becoming a conservation scientist. A 2013 survey conducted by the International Center for the Study of Preservation and Restoration of Cultural Property ([[ICCROM]]) on the education and training paths for conservation scientists worldwide concluded that:

{{quotation | the largest categories of recommend qualifications are the combinations BA+MA (24%) in conservation and BSc+MA in Conservation (23%). The majority, 87%, thinks you need both science and conservation qualifications. 44% of the respondents thing you should have 0-2 years of working experience, and 41% think you need 3 years or more.&lt;ref&gt;ICCROM. (2013). [http://forum2013.iccrom.org/background-research/ Survey of Conservation Education Programes] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140413211840/http://forum2013.iccrom.org/background-research/ |date=2014-04-13 }}.

This survey demonstrates that there is no worldwide consensus on the type and amount of education and training needed to become a conservation scientist, resulting in regional and institutional variations.

In the United States, the most common route taken is an advanced degree in a physical, natural, or applied science discipline such as physics, chemistry, material science, biology, engineering, and geology.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;Trentelman, K. (Summer 2005). [http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/newsletters/20_2/news_in_cons1.html Training and Education in Conservation Science]. GCI Newsletter, 20.2. Retrieved April 13, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  Master’s degrees are acceptable, but most conservation scientists have their PhD. In fact, a doctoral degree is becoming an increasingly common requirement for even entry-level conservation science positions.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  A basic knowledge of conservation theory and practice, art history, and/or other relevant humanities disciplines (e.g. archaeology, anthropology, fine arts, history, etc.) is also essential. Scientists seeking to enter the field typically gain this experience and knowledge through postdoctoral fellowships. There are several postdoctoral programs in particular for scientists to receive specialized training in conservation science, including those at the [[National Gallery of Art]] (the Charles Culpepper Fellowships), Harvard University Art Museum, and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]]. Numerous museums and cultural institutions also have individual advanced training fellowships in conservation science through such organizations as the Kress Foundation and the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt;  The Northwestern University-Art Institute of Chicago Center for Scientific Studies (NU-ACCESS) is one example of an Andrew W. Mellon funded fellowship.&lt;ref&gt;Northwestern University. (2013).

In Europe, there are two common routes taken to become a conservation scientist.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;EPISCON. (1999).

Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The first path is a postgraduate course in conservation science that includes training, research, and practice/experience with practicing conservators-restorers. The European PhD in Science for Conservation (EPISCON), which is a three-year fellowship program at ten participating institutions, is an example of such a program.

Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The second pathway is on the job training on a conservation science team combined with continuous professional development.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Professional organizations==
As a unique mixture of academic disciplines, conservation scientists may join an assortment of professional organizations to suit their varied needs and specializations. These organizations may include those dedicated solely to conservation science, conservation, or a related science field. Many of the general conservation and related science organizations, in fact, have specialized groups for conservation science. The [[American Ceramic Society]], for example, has an Art, Archaeology, and Conservation Science division devoted to advancing the scientific study of ceramics and their preservation.&lt;ref&gt;The American Ceramic Society. (2013). [http://ceramics.org/divisions/art-division Art, Archaeology and Conservation Science Division.] Retrieved April 14, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related positions==
Due to the nature of their job and positions in museums, conservation scientists are also sometimes referred to as “scientists,” “museum scientists,” “art scientists,” or “cultural heritage scientists.”  They are generally located organizationally in the conservation or science department of cultural institutions; although, some museums do have departments solely dedicated to conservation science (e.g. [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]]).&lt;ref&gt;Kunsthistorisches Museum. (n.d.). [http://www.moma.org/explore/multimedia/videos/238/1279 Conservation Science Department]. Retrieved April 19, 2104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservation scientists also collaborate with a variety of museum professionals and industrial scientists in order to accomplish all of their responsibilities and duties.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. (n.d.). [http://www.mfah.org/research/conservation/conservation-science/ Conservation Science]. Retrieved April 19, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the similar nature of their duties, they most frequently work with conservators (i.e. [[conservator-restorer]] and [[object conservator]]) and [[curators]] to complete technical studies on the objects in their museum’s collection to determine the materials used, the artist’s techniques, the authenticity of the work, and previous conservation treatments. These three professions also collaborate to determine conservation treatment goals and the ideal environmental conditions ([[preventive conservation]]) for the objects. [[Exhibition designers]], [[architects]], and [[collection managers]] also consult with conservation scientists to ensure that environmental conditions are suitable for the objects while either in storage or on display.

Industrial scientists are also consulted by conservation scientists about object materials and chemical studies. The two groups of scientists, along with instrument manufactures, also collaborate “to develop and adapt new non-invasive analytical techniques.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt;

'''Johan Didrik Frisch''' (4 May 1835, on a farm near [[Slagelse]] – 22 November 1867, [[Florence]]) was a Danish landscape and animal painter.

==Biography==
His father was a landowner. He began his education at the [[Sorø Academy]]; a private boarding school. While there, perhaps inspired by [[Frederik Vermehren]], who was a family friend, he started doing sketches.&lt;ref name="K"&gt;[https://www.kulturarv.dk/kid/VisKunstner.do?kunstnerId=3747&amp;wsektion=alle Biographical notes] @ Kunstindeks Danmark.&lt;/ref&gt; These drew the attention of the landscape painter [[Hans Harder]], who was sufficiently impressed that he helped him to begin his career as an artist.

After some time at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts]], he went to Paris in 1857 to continue his studies.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; While there, he began to show his paintings. Originally, he depicted figures, but soon turned to landscapes, then combined the two.

By 1866, however, he had decided to devote himself to animal painting and spent a great deal of time painting en [[plein aire]] at the [[Jægersborg Dyrehave]] (Deer Park). The following year, he received a scholarship from the Academy to study in Italy. He briefly visited Rome, then went to Florence, where he took up with his fellow Danish painters, [[Otto Bache]] and  [[L.A. Schou]].&lt;ref name="K" /&gt; 

During a [[cholera]] epidemic later that year, he and Schou were both infected and died within days of each other.&lt;ref name="K" /&gt;

The '''Goshen Players''' is a community theatre in [[Goshen, Connecticut]]. They occupy the Old Town Hall, located at the [[roundabout|rotary]] at the intersections of Routes 4 and 63. The Players are very proud to be the second oldest continuously performing theatre group in the state, Simsbury Light Opera being older by one year.

==History==
In 1949 the small group who gathered at the home of Dr. and Mrs. Albert Dolloff, wondering whether it would be possible to produce an [[operetta]], probably did not consider that they were initiating a springtime tradition in Goshen. The first group, like the present cast, was composed of a few members with professional experience and a majority of amateurs with varying stage experience. Their presentation of ''[[Trial By Jury]]'' was such a success that they gave request performances in [[Cornwall, Connecticut|Cornwall]], [[Litchfield, Connecticut|Litchfield]], and West [[Torrington, Connecticut|Torrington]]. Proceeds were divided between the Church of Christ, Congregational, and St. Thomas' Church, both of Goshen.

==The future==
The Goshen Players inaugurated their first full season in 2005 with a production of ''[[Blithe Spirit (play)|Blithe Spirit]]'' in the fall and Urinetown the Musical in the spring of 2006. They will be presenting Neil Simon's Rumors as their fall production of the 2006-2007 season. A staged reading of Tom Dudzick's comedy "Greetings!" was performed in November 2006.

{{intellectual property}}
'''Intellectual rights''' (from "{{lang-fr|droits intellectuels}}") is a term sometimes used to refer to the legal protection afforded to owners of [[intellectual capital]].  This notion is more commonly referred to as "[[intellectual property]]", though "intellectual rights" more aptly describes the nature of the protections afforded by most nations.

Both terms were used in [[Europe]] during the 19th century as a means of distinguishing between two different views of intellectual protection.  "Intellectual property" was generally used to advocate a belief that [[copyright]]s and [[patent]]s should provide rights similar to physical [[Legal property|property]] rights.  The term "intellectual rights" was used by those who felt that such protection should take the form of temporary, limited grants.

Although most modern copyright systems do not treat copyrighted or patented materials in the same way as real property, the term "intellectual property" has gained prominence.  For more on this subject, see "[[intellectual property]]".

Also, at least three different kinds of capital and rights are involved:
*creativity ([[individual capital]]) which implies rights to benefit from one's free expression
*invention ([[instructional capital]]) which implies rights to benefit from having created some more efficient device or process
*reputation ([[social capital]]) which implies rights not to have one's name or specific distinguishing tagline or ethic sullied by imitators or rivals

All three capital terms predate the term [[intellectual capital]], which appears to be a 19th-century artifact of early, now-discredited, economic theory.

In 20th-century Europe also originated another more modern approach, intended to sweep away the differences between the historical "[[Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]]" and "Intellectual Rights" camps, allowing every creator both perpetual and temporary rights:
* [[Moral rights (copyright law)|Moral rights]] became the [[unalienable]] part of the rights every author was entitled to. These rights could generally not be [[waiver|waived]];
* All other [[intellectual property rights]] were to become both limited in time and tradeable.

Note that this is one of the chief differences between [[United States|U.S.]] and [[European Union|EU]] approach towards [[Intellectual property rights]] up till the early 21st century, in that the crystallisation of this modern approach (the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works]]) is still only partially put in practice in the [[United States|U.S.]], and, where applied, this is done largely outside the legislation regarding [[Intellectual property|IP]].

'''Piety ([[Sawab]]) in Islam''' is considered to be one of the most important [[Islamic ethics]].  Piety is normally referred to as [[Taqwa]] in the Arabic language, which is derived from the root ‘waqaya,’ meaning ‘to safeguard’ or ‘to abstain.’  In Islamic terminology, this is defined as the act of restraining oneself from disobeying the commands of Allah.  Pious acts of self-restraint or self-control, wherein an individual abstains from committing a sin, are believed to bestow virtue upon that individual.  These acts of abstinence are considered the result of the individual's overall capability for self-restraint.  No single act itself constitutes piety; piety describes possessing the power of self-control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Self building|first=Amini|last=Ayatollah Ibrahim| publisher=  Author house, Bloomington|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com/booksid=hEzv08LMbocC&amp;dq=Appendix+Three:+Ritual+Practices+in+Shiism |isbn=978-1-4918-4881-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allah tells us in Quran that he does not differentiate between people expect on "taqwa."

==Meaning==
Piety has been defined in various ways by different people and among whom are as follow:
*“Taqwa(piety), means to be conscious of the existence of Allah, acting toward pleasing Allah, fear Allah and seek protection from the anger of Allah and His punishment. This protection is realized by doing what Allah commands, and refraining from everything that Allah forbids. In brief, this protection is realized by obeying Allah which emanates only from the correct and strong belief in Him. This belief comprises the genuine love of Allah as well as the genuine fear of Him….”&lt;ref name=web&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recharge.net/profile/Khalid_Ahmad/publication/228221597|title= Implications of Piety (Taqwa) on Organizational Citizenship Behavior (OCB) from Islamic Perspective: A Study of Professionals in Southeast Asia=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;	 
Also other define it as thus:
*“Taqwa(piety) is .. a religious belief...which is important in Islam.  Taqwa… in Islam is one of the interpretations of Islamic insight people would understand…that is…surrender to the will of God. Surrender to the will of God is basically what Taqwa is… " &lt;ref name="web" /&gt;	
*“Taqwa(piety) is whereby a Muslim intentionally evades actions that lead to Allah`s fury and displeasure and at the same time deliberately undertakes steps and acts that will gratify Allah as mentioned in Suratul Al-Imran.  In other words, it permits a person to be always conscious for both Allah's all-encompassing knowledge and characteristics and a reminder of their relationship and responsibility to Allah as his creation and servant. Hence, the way to Taqwa is through obedience of Allah, avoiding disobedience, and striving to stay away from doubtful matters” &lt;ref name="web" /&gt;
*When Imam Ja’far as-Sadiq was asked to elaborate on the meaning of the word, ‘Taqwa’(piety), he replied, “Submit to the command of Allah and do not go near the prohibited.” It means that one should endeavor to fulfill all the commands of Allah and abstain from the prohibited things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Greater sin|first=Dastghaib|last=AbdulHussein| publisher=Ansariyan|year=2004|url=https://books.google.com|isbn=9789644386060}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
in another place he define piety as thus: "Piety is that Allah does not miss you in the place where He has commanded you to be,and does not see (find) you where He has forbidden you from." &lt;ref name=define&gt;{{cite book|title=A Bundle of flower|first=Sadr-'amali|last=Sayyid Abbas| publisher=Lulu.com|year=2014|url=https://books.google.com|isbn=9781312522206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kahramana''' is a fountain located in Baghdad's Sa'adoon Street depicting a scene from the legend of ''[[Ali Baba]] and the Forty Thieves''; a story taken from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' in which the slave girl Marjana outwitted the thieves by tricking them into hiding inside jars over which she poured hot oil. The statue was officially opened in 1971 and was the work of the Iraqi sculptor, [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]]. It has become one of Baghdad's most iconic public artworks. In the aftermath of the US-led invasion of 2003, the work assumed new meanings for the Iraqi people. 

==Background==
From 1969 when Iraq became a republic and the  [[Hashemite]] monarchy was overthrown, leading artists and sculptors were commissioned to produce artworks that would beautify the city of Baghdad, glorify Iraq's ancient past and contribute to a sense of national identity. During this period, sculptors including [[Khaled al-Rahal]], [[Jawad Saleem]] and [[Mohammed Ghani Hikmat]] executed a number of high profile public monuments which are now dotted around the city of Baghdad. &lt;ref&gt;al-Kalil, S., ''Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq.'' Berkeley, University of California Press, pp 72-75; Shabout, N., "The "Free" art of Occupation: Images for a "New" Iraq," ''Arab Studies Quarterly,'' Vol. 28, No. 3/4 2006, pp. 41-53; Brown, B.A. and Feldman, M.H. (eds), ''Critical Approaches to Ancient Near Eastern Art,''Walter de Gruyter, 2014 p.20&lt;/ref&gt;

Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, who was commissioned to construct ''Kahramana'', was a well-known Iraqi sculptor, whose public works were on display throughout Baghdad's streetscapes and urban spaces. His works achieved popularity because they depicted scenes from the everyday life of Baghdad's people and also drew on Iraqi folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Floyd, T., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat," [Biographical Notes], Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/bios/Pages/Mohammed-Ghani-Hikmat.aspx Online:] &lt;/ref&gt; Many of Ghani's early sculptures were inspired by Iraqi folklore, especially characters from  [[One Thousand and One Nights]] (widely known as the ''Tales of Arabian Nights'').&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/doodles/mohammed-ghani-hikmats-87th-birthday|title= Mohammed Ghani Hikmat’s 87th birthday|date=20 April 2016| access-date=28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His early works were figurative and included statues of ''Sinbad, the Sailor;'' the 10th-century poet, ''[[Al-Mutanabbi]]''; the first Abassid Caliph, ''[[Al-Mansur|Abu-Ja'afar Mansur]]'' (in stone); ''[[Hammurabi]]'' (in bronze) and ''[[Gilgamesh]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; As Ghani matured, his work became increasingly  abstract, but he never lost sight of the need to reference Iraq's ancient art traditions through the use of Arabic script, geometric designs, and Sumerian architectural features.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, pp 73-75&lt;/ref&gt; 

His most well-known works include a pair of statues of ''[[Scheherazade|Queen Scheherazade]] and [[List of One Thousand and One Nights characters#Shahryār|King Shahryar]]'', located on the banks of the Tigris River, near Abu Nuwas Street and the ''Fountain of Kahramana'' in the central business district.&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt, M.S., "Mohammed Ghani Hikmat, Iraqi Sculptor, Dies at 82", ''New York Times,'' 21 September, 2011, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/21/arts/design/mohammed-ghani-hikmat-iraqi-sculptor-dies-at-82.html Online:]; "Artist and Sculptor Mohamed Ghani Hikmat", ''Al Jazeera News'' 15 September, 2011, [http://www.aljazeera.net/news/cultureandart/2011/9/15/%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%AA-%D9%85%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%AA Online:] &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Built in the late 1960s and inaugurated in 1971, the fountain was inspired by the story of ''Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves'' from ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'' and the slave girl, Marjana (or Morgiana), who outwitted the thieves. The story relates how the slave girl persuaded thieves, who had come to attack her master, to hide in storage jars. She then pours boiling oil into the jars to kill the thieves.

The fountain depicts the slave girl standing over 40 jars, ready to pour the hot oil. It was cast in bronze, stands 3.3 metres in height and is situated in Kahramana Square, Sa'adoon Street, Baghdad. As the girl pours the water, a series of lilting fountains cascades downward towards the base of the statue.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Khalil, S. and Makiya, K., ''The Monument: Art, Vulgarity, and Responsibility in Iraq,'' University of California Press, 1991, p. 74 and p.42; Shabout, N., "Jewad Selim: On Abstraction and Symbolism," in ''Mathaf Encyclopedia of Modern Art and the Arab World,'' [http://www.encyclopedia.mathaf.org.qa/en/essays/Pages/Jewad-Selim,-On-Abstraction-and-Symbolism.aspx Online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The cascading water contributed to the monument's grandeur, but the water was turned off during the Iran-Iraq war and the fountain fell into a state of disrepair, with overgrown verges and the base of the fountain filled with litter. Its storage jars were painted green, a colour that drew the disapproval of the sculptor. &lt;ref&gt;Omar, M., ''Barefoot in Baghdad: A Story of Identity-My Own and What It Means to Be a Woman in Chaos'' Sourcebooks, 2010, [E-book edition] n.p.; Shadid, A., ''The Washington Post Pulitzers: Anthony Shadid, International Reporting,'' The Washington Post and Diversion Books, 2014  [E-book edition] n.p.; ''Night Draws Near: Shadid, A., ''Iraq's People in the Shadow of America's War'', Henry Holt and Company, 2006 [E-book edition] n.p.; Antoon, S., "Living With Death in Baghdad", ''New York Times'', 20  July, 2016 [https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/opinion/living-with-death-in-baghdad.html Online:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the US-led invasion of 2003, some of Hikmat's work took on new meanings and new political interpretations emerged from Iraq's destruction. At the time, the Iraqis saw that the work represented the  new reality of their country and the number '40' became charged with meaning. The Provisional Governing Council, after the occupation, included forty people, which came to symoblise the forty thieves; and the decisions of the Iraqi civil administrator, [[Paul Bremer]], consisted of 53 resolutions, with Resolution No. 40 referring to the dissolution of the Iraqi army.&lt;ref&gt;"Mohammed Ghani Hikmat: Baghdad Recalls its Sculptor" ''AlAraby'' 22 September 2015[https://www.alaraby.co.uk/culture/2015/9/22/%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF-%D8%BA%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85%D8%AA-%D8%A8%D8%BA%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%AF-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%B1-%D9%86%D8%AD%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7 Online:] (translated from Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; This resolution, which left some 400,000 Iraqi soldiers without employment, led to public protests and the Kahramana fountain became a popular starting point for public demonstrations and civil rights campaigners.&lt;ref&gt;Sulaymaniyah "Kahramana Week for Women Across Baghdad", ''Iraqi Civil Society'', 11

'''''Leonardo®''''' is a [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] published by the [[MIT Press]] covering the application of contemporary science and technology to the arts and music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mitpressjournals.org/page/about/leon About ''Leonardo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Leonardo journal was established in 1968 by artist and scientist [[Frank Malina]] in [[Paris]], [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leonardo.info/isast/leostory.html History of ''Leonardo'']&lt;/ref&gt; ''Leonardo'' has published writings by artists who work with science- and technology-based art media for 50 years. Journal operations were moved to the [[San Francisco Bay]] Area by Frank's son [[Roger Malina]], an astronomer and space scientist, who took over operations of the journal upon Frank Malina's death in 1981. In 1982, the International Society for the Arts Sciences and Technology ([[Leonardo, The International Society of the Arts, Sciences and Technology|Leonardo/ISAST]]) was founded to further the aims of ''Leonardo'' by providing avenues of communication for artists working in contemporary media. The society also publishes ''[[Leonardo Music Journal]]'', the ''[[Leonardo Electronic Almanac]]'', ''[[Leonardo Reviews]]'', and the ''[[Leonardo Book Series]]''. All publications are produced in collaboration with the [[MIT Press]].

Other activities of the organization include an awards program and participation in annual conferences and symposiums such as the Space and the Arts Workshop and the annual College Art Association conference. Leonardo has a sister organization in France, the Association Leonardo, that publishes the ''Observatoire Leonardo'' website. While encouraging the innovative presentation of technology-based arts, the society also functions as an international meeting place for artists, educators, students, scientists and others interested in the use of new media in contemporary artistic expression.

The aims of the organization include the documentation of personal and innovative technologies developed by artists, similar to the way in which findings of scientists are documented in journal publications.&lt;ref&gt;Leonardo de Cardoso: ''Visual Music: An Ethnography of an Experimental Art in Los Angeles'', Master's Thesis, University of Texas at Austin, May 2010, [http://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2010-05-1228/CARDOSO-MASTERS-REPORT.pdf#page=47 p. 39]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4833">The anonymous '''''Liber diversarum arcium''''' ('Book of various arts') is a [[medieval]] [[:Category:Art technological sources | handbook of painting]]. It contains over 500 art-technological instructions or recipes in [[Latin]], forming a complete structured painting course. It is probably the most substantial and comprehensive mediaeval [[:Category:Art technological sources | painters' technical recipe book]] to survive, and summarises the state of the art in the European workshops of the fourteenth century. In particular it is an important witness to the practice of [[oil painting]] before [[Van Eyck]]. The majority of the [[:Category:Art technological sources | recipes]] are unique.&lt;ref name=clarke&gt;Clarke, M. (2011) ''Mediaeval Painters’ Materials and Techniques: The Montpellier ‘Liber diversarum arcium’.'' London: Archetype Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''Liber diversarum arcium'' is preserved in Manuscript H 277, fonds ancien, Bibliothèque interuniversitaire, section médecine, [[Montpellier]], [[France]] ([[Recto and verso|folios]] 81v-101v).&lt;ref&gt;Ravaisson, F. and Libri, G. (1849) ''Catalogue général des manuscrits des bibliothèques publiques des departments'', Vol. 1. Paris:  Imprimerie National, pp. 394–9, 739–811.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this manuscript dates from circa 1430 and was written in or near [[Venice]], in fact the textual core of the ''Liber diversarum arcium'' itself mainly reflects northern European practices, and probably dates from c.1300. This core consists partly of compilations of earlier technical recipes (but re-worked to make them more useful), and partly of newly composed material. During the fourteenth century various material (much of it Italian) was added to this core. &lt;ref name=clarke/&gt;

== Content ==
The text is substantial (26,000 words in Latin - thus containing far more on painting than the more famous ''[[Theophilus Presbyter]]''), and is unusual among medieval artists' recipe books in being highly structured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uhb.fr/alc/medieval/cd10/Oltrogge.pdf |format=PDF |last=Oltrogge |first=Doris |year=1998 |title=Cum sesto et rigula', l’organisation du savoir technologique dans le Liber diversarum artium de Montpellier et dans le De diversis artibus de Théophile, ''Cahiers Diderot'' 10: 67–99. (Issue title: ''Encyclopédies Médiévales: Discours et Savoirs'', B. Baillaud, J. de Gramont, D. Hüe (eds).) |publisher=Uhb.fr |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221162247/http://www.uhb.fr/alc/medieval/cd10/Oltrogge.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Book I (the longest) describes the fundamentals of painting: [[drawing]], choice and preparation of [[pigment]]s, preparing media and [[tempera]], mixing pigments and modelling, and finally [[gilding]].
* Book II describes the advanced techniques, and the variations and refinements in technique, necessary for [[Oil paint|oil painting]] on wood: preparation of [[Panel painting|panels]], oils and [[varnish]]es, differences in the behaviour of [[pigment]]s in [[Oil paint|oil]], [[gilding]], imitation [[sgraffito]] etc.
* Book III (the shortest) describes the variations in technique and materials needed to paint [[mural]]s. 
* Book IV describes painting on glass and ceramics, and some other auxiliary decorative techniques: [[gilding]], [[silvering]] and colouring of metals, [[dyeing]] (principally for wood or skins), painting ceramics, [[Stained glass | painting glass]], and making and attaching [[artificial gem]]s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23688">This is a list of surviving [[Ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] [[gold glass]] portraits of the finer painted sort.  The majority of surviving Roman gold glass pieces are the cut-off bottoms of drinking glasses made with unpainted [[gold leaf]]. These sometimes bear the names of individuals and were probably commemorative gifts on a special occasion such as a wedding anniversary or winning a contest.  Achieving a good likeness was probably not an aim, and certainly not an achievement of this class of object,{{cn|date=April 2018}} and they are not included here. The objects here belong to a smaller class of finely painted portrait miniatures, although a few seem also to have been originally placed in cups. Following a table summarizing the basic information, individual portraits are discussed in separate sections.

==Brescia medallion==
[[File:Galla Placidia (rechts) und ihre Kinder.jpg|thumb|right|Brescia medallion]]
The portrait medallion is a part of the ornamentation of the so-called Desiderius Cross, 9th-century [[processional cross|processional]] [[crux gemmata]] currently preserved in [[Museo di Santa Giulia]], [[Brescia]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=bresciamusei /&gt;

The medallion is often referred to as a portrait of [[Galla Placidia]] and her children, but the scholarly consensus is strongly against this 18th-century identification.&lt;ref name=jasper /&gt;&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt;

Some 19th-century scholars, including [[Raffaele Garrucci]] and [[Hermann Vopel]], suspected the work to be a fake.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrucci 1858, p. 83; pl. XL, 7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vopel 1899, no. 507&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest mention of the medallion comes from a 17th-century inventory.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt; In 1762, [[Francesco Antonio Zaccaria]] recalled that he saw it circa 1725.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt;

Several details indicate the [[Egypt (Roman province)|Egyptian]], perhaps [[Alexandria]]n origin of the medallion. Both words of the inscription ({{lang|grc|ΒΟΥΝΝΕΡΙ ΚΕΡΑΜΙ}}) end in [[iota]], possibly indicating the [[Ancient Greek]] dialect of Egypt; {{lang|grc|ΚΕΡΑΜΙ}}, then, means "potter".&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt; Stylistically, the painting is closely related to the 3rd-century [[Fayum mummy portraits|mummy portraits]] found in the [[Faiyum Oasis]].&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 353"/&gt; The costumes are more consistent with the contemporary fashions in Egypt than in Rome itself. In particular, the mantle worn by the middle figure is not fastened by a [[fibula]], but instead knotted; one parallel for this is a 3rd-century [[Copts|Coptic]] [[tapestry]] medallion, now in the [[Hermitage Museum]], showing the goddess [[Gaia (mythology)|Gea]] with her mantle knotted in a similar way.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 354"&gt;Breck 1927, p. 354&lt;/ref&gt; The peculiar hair style of the older woman is unknown in Roman portraiture, but can be found on some 3rd-century plaster mummy masks from Egypt.&lt;ref name="Breck 1927, p. 354" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;One example from the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]: [https://www.flickr.com/photos/mharrsch/599898584 link].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Daniel T. Howells (2015) summarizes the research into the Brescia medallion demonstrating its connection to contemporaneous Roman-Egyptian art (in particular the Fayum mummy portraits) as well as linguistic evidence proving the authenticity of the artefact versus the now dubious claim about it being a forgery.&lt;ref name="howells 2015 p7"&gt;Daniel Thomas Howells (2015). "[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/Late_Antique_Gold_Glass_online.pdf A Catalogue of the Late Antique Gold Glass in the British Museum (PDF).]" London: the British Museum (Arts and Humanities Research Council). Accessed 2 October 2016, p. 7: "''Other important contributions to scholarship included the publication of an extensive summary of gold glass scholarship under the entry ‘Fonds de coupes’ in Fernand Cabrol and Henri Leclercq’s comprehensive Dictionnaire d’archéologie chrétienne et de liturgie in 1923. Leclercq updated Vopel’s catalogue, recording 512 gold glasses considered to be genuine, and developed a typological series consisting of eleven iconographic subjects: biblical subjects; Christ and the saints; various legends; inscriptions; pagan deities; secular subjects; male portraits; female portraits; portraits of couples and families; animals; and Jewish symbols. In a 1926 article devoted to the brushed technique gold glass known as the Brescia medallion (Pl. 1), Fernand de Mély challenged the deeply ingrained opinion of Garrucci and Vopel that all examples of brushed technique gold glass were in fact forgeries. The following year, de Mély’s hypothesis was supported and further elaborated upon in two articles by different scholars. A case for the Brescia medallion’s authenticity was argued for, not on the basis of its iconographic and orthographic similarity with pieces from Rome (a key reason for Garrucci’s dismissal), but instead for its close similarity to the Fayoum mummy portraits from Egypt. Indeed, this comparison was given further credence by Walter Crum’s assertion that the Greek inscription on the medallion was written in the Alexandrian dialect of Egypt. De Mély noted that the medallion and its inscription had been reported as early as 1725, far too early for the idiosyncrasies of Graeco-Egyptian word endings to have been understood by forgers.''"

"''Comparing the iconography of the Brescia medallion with other more closely dated objects from Egypt, Hayford Peirce then proposed that brushed technique medallions were produced in the early 3rd century, whilst de Mély himself advocated a more general 3rd-century date. With the authenticity of the medallion more firmly established, Joseph Breck was prepared to propose a late 3rd to early 4th century date for all of the brushed technique cobalt blue-backed portrait medallions, some of which also had Greek inscriptions in the Alexandrian dialect. Although considered genuine by the majority of scholars by this point, the unequivocal authenticity of these glasses was not fully established until 1941 when Gerhart Ladner discovered and published a photograph of one such medallion still in situ, where it remains to this day, impressed into the plaster sealing in an individual loculus in the Catacomb of Panfilo in Rome (Pl. 2). Shortly after in 1942, Morey used the phrase ‘brushed technique’ to categorize this gold glass type, the iconography being produced through a series of small incisions undertaken with a gem cutter’s precision and lending themselves to a chiaroscuro-like effect similar to that of a fine steel engraving simulating brush strokes.''"&lt;/ref&gt; Jás Elsner (2007) also contends that the Brescia medallion likely depicts a family from [[Alexandria]], since the inscription is in the Alexandrian dialect of Greek, and provides possible dates ranging from the early-3rd to mid-5th century AD, before it found its way to Italy where it adorned a 7th-century cross.&lt;ref&gt;Jás Elsner (2007).

==Fakes==
Gold-glass forgeries are known to have been forged all through the 18th and 19th centuries. In 1759, French [[antiquarian]] [[Anne Claude de Caylus]] wrote that contemporary Roman dealers were selling gold-glass reproductions to tourists who thought them original.&lt;ref&gt;Caylus 1759, p. 195, quote: "Ce moyen a été retrouvé à Rome, il y a très-peu d'années; j'en ai jugé par quelques morceaux très- bien traités: on s'en est servi pour tromper les Etrangers; mais celui qui possédoit ce petit secret est mort sans le publier"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Breck 1927, pp. 353–354&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] has what are thought to be two 18th-century fake group portraits,&lt;ref name=met.fake.1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=met.fake.2 /&gt; while the [[British Museum]] has two 19th-century ones.&lt;ref name=bm.fake.1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=bm.fake.2 /&gt;

'''''Mariana''''' is an 1851 [[panel painting|oil-on-wood]] painting by [[John Everett Millais]]. The image is based on the solitary Mariana from [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]'', written between 1601 and 1606. In the play, Mariana was to be married, but was rejected when her dowry was lost in a shipwreck. Her story was retold in "[[Mariana (poem)|Mariana]]", a poem published in 1830 by [[Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson|Tennyson]], which provided additional inspiration for Millais' painting. The painting is regarded as an example of Millais' "precision, attention to detail, and stellar ability as a colorist".&lt;ref name="SallyK"&gt;King, Sally. "[http://www.victorianweb.org/painting/millais/paintings/king1.html "Aweary" and Waiting: John Everett Millais's Mariana]". English 156 / History of Art 152, Brown University, 2007. Retrieved 21 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Millais was a founding member of the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], a group of English artists who came together in 1848 with the goal of renewing British painting. They found in the art of the early Italian Renaissance—before [[Raphael]]—a sincerity of purpose and clarity of form that they sought to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;Treuherz, J. (2003). ''Pre-Raphaelitism''. Grove Art Online.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:William Hunt Claudio and Isabella Shakespeare Measure for Measure.jpg|thumb|upright|''Mariana'' may have been painted as a companion piece to ''Claudio and Isabella'' (1850) by [[William Holman Hunt]]&lt;ref name=Tate&gt;{{cite web|last=Fowle|first=Frances|title=Sir John Everett Millais, Bt ''Mariana'' 1851|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/millais-mariana-t07553/text-summary|publisher=The Tate|accessdate=22 January 2013|date=December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;]] Oftentimes the PRB artists used allegorical images to create a narrative, which taught a moral virtue or virtues.  Sometimes they used contemporary literature as inspiration for their paintings, which often include numerous details that allow the viewer to "read" the painting. Millais used Tennyson's poetry to create a narrative for his painting of ''Mariana'' and he wanted to allow the viewer familiar with Tennyson's poetry to read the entire poem through the painting.

When it was first exhibited at the [[Royal Academy]] in 1851, the display caption contained lines from Tennyson's "Mariana" (1830):

&lt;poem&gt;
    She only said, 'My life is dreary,
      He cometh not,' she said;
    She said, 'I am aweary, aweary,'
      I would that I were dead!'
&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting is packed with details that help the viewer to read the narrative of the work along with Tennyson's poetry.  Everything from the rolled embroidery that Mariana has been working on and the leaves outside of the window point the reader in the direction of the narrative which is about a young woman rejected by her fiancé because her dowry was lost at sea. It is about waiting and the passage of time, which Millais shows by the arched-back pose of the woman.  The pose makes it seem like she has been sitting too long and she must stand up to stretch before she sits again.  The rolled embroidery on the table gives the viewer a clue as to how long Mariana has been working on it.

In the painting ''Mariana'', Millais included many details that relate directly to Tennyson's poetry.  One example is the curtain.  In the poem, Tennyson wrote, "When thickest dark did trance the sky, She drew her casement-curtain by, and glanced athwart the glooming flats".&lt;ref name="Poems and Plays"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tennyson|first1=Alfred|title=Poems and Plays|date=1965|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is not a curtain in Millais' painting, this line is similar to the scene that is presented outside of the window.  The viewer perceives an ominous feeling, just like the dark storm that Tennyson alludes to in the line above.  The little mouse that is on the floor towards the bottom right corner is a detail that Millais took from Tennyson's poem: "the mouse behind the mouldering wainscots shriek'd or from the crevice peer'd about".  Together, Millais' painting and Tennyson's poem create an intriguing storyline for the reader to follow.&lt;ref name="Poems and Plays"/&gt;

Some of his work appeared under the [[pen name]] "Mart Dellon."

==Biography==
===Early life and education===
Born in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]], Nodell was the son of Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story| title=Superhero summer: Behind 'Green Lantern' and the rest, an American story|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110623172041/http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story|archivedate=June 23, 2011|deadurl=no|first=Gloria|last= Goodale|date= June 17, 2011 |accessdate=December 14, 2011|work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] | page= [http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Society/2011/0617/Superhero-summer-Behind-Green-Lantern-and-the-rest-an-American-story/(page)/2 2]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Art Institute of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=lam&gt;[https://www.lambiek.net/artists/n/nodell_martin.htm Martin Nodell] at the [[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]. This source says Nodell also attended the "Chicago Academy of Art", but no school of that name exists, and the [[Chicago Academy for the Arts]] was not founded until 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to [[New York City]] in the 1930s, where he attended [[Pratt Institute]].&lt;ref name=lam /&gt;

===National Comics Publications===
Nodell began his illustrating career in 1938, working first as a freelancer. In 1940 he provided some work for [[Sheldon Mayer]], an editor at [[All-American Publications]], one of three companies that ultimately merged to form [[National Comics Publications]] (present-day [[DC Comics]]). Interested in gaining more steady employment, Nodell created designs for a new character that would become the Golden Age [[Green Lantern]] ([[Alan Scott]]). The inspiration came in January 1940 at the 34th Street [[Subway (rail)|subway]] station in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; Nodell noticed a trainman waving a lantern along the darkened tracks. He coupled the imagery with elements from [[Richard Wagner]]'s [[opera]]tic [[Ring cycle]]&lt;ref name=independent /&gt; as well as [[Chinese folklore]] and [[Greek mythology]]&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB6 /&gt; to create the hero.&lt;ref name="newsday"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dionisio |first=Joseph |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5zBx0HteF?url=http://web.archive.org/web/20070205153908/http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11,0,3651663.story |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |title=Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell, 91 |work=[[Newsday]] |date=December 11, 2006 |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/obituaries/ny-lidnode115011627dec11%2C0%2C3651663.story |deadurl=yes |df= }} Additional, June 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Nodell himself described in 2000:
{{quote|I picked out the name from the train man on the tracks who was waving a lantern, going from red to green.... Green meant go and I decided that was it. Then I needed a colorful and interesting costume. I was interested in Greek mythology and so the costume took on elements of that. It just all fell into place. When I sent it in, I waited into the second week before I heard the word to come in. I was ushered into [[Max Gaines|Mr. [Max] Gaines]] office, publisher, and after sitting a long time and flipping through the pages of my presentation, he announced, 'We like it!' And then, 'Get to work!' I did the first five pages of an eight page story, and then they called in Bill Finger to help. We worked on it for seven years.&lt;ref&gt;Nodell in {{cite web| last=Black| first= Bill| url= http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |title=An Interview with Green Lantern Creator Martin Nodell| publisher= AC Comics|year= 2000| archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5zBwS4Oy9?url=http://www.accomics.com/accomics/goldenage/nuggets_nodell.html |archivedate= June 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The first adventure, drawn by Nodell (as Mart Dellon) and written by [[Bill Finger]], appeared in ''[[All-American Comics]]'' #16 (July 1940). Nodell continued to use the pseudonym through at least ''[[All Star Comics]]''&lt;!--sp OK with no hyphen--&gt; #2 (Fall 1940).&lt;ref name=gcd&gt;[http://www.comics.org/credit/name/martin%20nodell/sort/chrono/ Martin Nodell] at the [[Grand Comics Database]]&lt;/ref&gt; He said in 2000 he had used the pen name since, "Comics were a forbidden literature, culturally unacceptable. It wasn't something you were proud of". Nodell penciled and virtually always self-inked Green Lantern stories in ''All-American'' and ''All Star'' until the character got his own title, the premiere issue cover-dated July 1941. He would continue with it through to #25 (May 1947), very rarely drawing the covers, before being succeeded by a variety of artists including [[Howard Purcell]], [[Irwin Hasen]], and [[Alex Toth]].

===Timely Comics===
[[Image:MarvelTales93.jpg|left|thumb|''Marvel Tales'' #93 (Aug. 1949). Cover art by Nodell.&lt;!--per [http://www.comics.org/details.lasso?id=7756 this page] at the Grand Comics Database--&gt;]]
Nodell left All-American in 1947 and joined [[Timely Comics]], the 1930s–40s forerunner of [[Marvel Comics]]), where he drew postwar stories of [[Captain America]], the [[Human Torch]] and the [[Sub-Mariner]]. His work there was rarely signed, making idenfication difficult, though comics historians have confirmed that Nodell drew two well-known covers: The first issue of ''[[Marvel Tales]]'', Timely's [[horror fiction|horror]]-comics revamp of the company's flagship series ''[[Marvel Mystery Comics]]''; and the penultimate issue (#74) of Captain America's book, which for its last two issues became the horror-oriented ''Captain America's Weird Tales''.

===Post-1950s career===
In 1950, Nodell left comics to work in advertising and later joined the [[Leo Burnett Agency]] in Chicago as an [[art director]]. In 1965, his design team there developed the long-running [[flour]]-company mascot the [[Pillsbury Doughboy]].&lt;ref&gt;Dionisio, 2000. Sidebar [http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/lantern-s-light-celebrity-fans-flock-to-the-hip-dc-comics-superhero-but-he-still-can-t-get-a-movie-gig-1.477749 "Ring Power vs. Flour Power"].&lt;/ref&gt;

His only known comics work in the interim are penciling the story "The Glistening Death" in the [[Avon Comics]] [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''City of the Living Dead'' (1952), reprinted two decades later in the [[Skywald]] horror-comics magazine ''Psycho'' #1 (Jan. 1971); and "Master of the Dead" in Avon's ''Eerie'' (1951 series) #14, reprinted in Skywald's ''Nightmare'' #1 (Dec. 1970).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt;

In the 1980s, Nodell submitted new work to DC, which led to his being rediscovered by comic fans. His first pieces included a 13-page puzzle-and-activity section in ''[[Super Friends|Super Friends Special]]'' #1 (1981), and drawing the Golden Age [[Harlequin (comics)#Molly Mayne|Harlequin]] in ''[[Who's Who in the DC Universe|Who's Who: The Definitive Directory of the DC Universe]]'' #10 (Dec. 1985).&lt;ref name=gcd /&gt; His final two published pieces of Green Lantern art were a one-page illustration of Golden Age [[Alan Scott]] Green Lantern in the 50th-anniversary issue ''Green Lantern'' vol. 3, #19 (Dec. 1991)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/50454/ ''Green Lantern'' DC, 1990 Series) #19] at Grand Comics Database&lt;/ref&gt; and a one-page illustration of the Alan Scott Green Lantern and [[Superman]] in the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1 (Dec. 1995).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.org/issue/58075/ ''Superman: The Man of Steel Gallery'' #1] at the Grand Comics Database. Note: The [http://www.comics.org/issue/91581/ GCD also lists] Nodell among three [[pencilers]] who contributed to the single [[Hal Jordan]] Green Lantern figure on the cover of the [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Green Lantern Gallery'' #1 (1996), but this cover is signed only by penciler [[Gil Kane]] and [[inker]] [[Kevin Nowlan]].&lt;/ref&gt; At 80, Nodell penciled his final comic-book work, the whimsical, 10-page [[Harlan Ellison]] adaptation "Gnomebody", scripted by [[John Ostrander]] and Ellison and inked by [[Jed Hotchkiss]], in [[Dark Horse Comics]]' ''Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Quarterly'' #1 (Aug. 1996).

===Personal life===
Nodell met his future wife, Carrie, at [[Coney Island]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in September 1940.&lt;ref name=dionisio-pB9&gt;Dionisio, 2000. [http://www.newsday.com/lifestyle/lantern-s-light-celebrity-fans-flock-to-the-hip-dc-comics-superhero-but-he-still-can-t-get-a-movie-gig-1.477749 p.

The '''multiverse''' is a series of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universes]] in many of the [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] [[novel]]s and [[Short story|short stories]] written by [[Michael Moorcock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  |quote= Some of Moorcock's genre fiction is borderline SF, though most of it is better described as fantasy. One of the most impressive aspects of this achievement is the way in which he has linked much of his fiction together into one monumental sequence, The Tale of The Eternal Champion. Central to this ongoing series is Moorcock's concept of the Multiverse. The Multiverse was introduced in Moorcock's early novel ''The Sundered Worlds'' and is an imaginative construct of transitorally intersecting parallel and alternate worlds, an infinite series of concurrent, sometimes intertwined universes between which the Eternal Champion moves.  This Multiverse concept has been accepted by Physics as the Many World Theorem lending authenticity to Moorcock's ideas.  The idea that there are an infinite number of worlds as real as our own provides quite the platform for elaboration and conjecture by authors of today and tomorrow.  Moorcock's multiverse stands as perhaps the first exploration of these many worlds and the possibilities within"

Some of these parallel worlds operate according to SF premises, some – like the worlds in which various avatars of Moorcock's Eternal Champion series play out their linked destinies - operate in fantasy terms. Worlds governed by incompatible premises are not, however, barred from each other and in this sense the overall concept belongs more properly to fantasy than to Sf. Moorcock himself treats his extremely large and varied oeuvre as though all its venues occupy niches in the one multiverse.

'''''Nerikomi''''' (練り込み , lit. "kneading") is an artistic technique for creating [[Japanese pottery]] [[agateware]].  The name derives from the traditional technique of creating patterns with colored [[clay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://the-empty-vessel.blogspot.com/2007/01/nerikomi.html&lt;/ref&gt; The technique is also called '''''neriage''''' (練上げ).&lt;ref&gt;http://galleryjapan.com/locale/en_US/technique/ceramics/10108/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ceramicartsdaily.org/pottery-making-techniques/wheel-throwing-techniques/you-say-neriage-i-say-nerikomino-matter-what-you-call-it-mixing-colored-clays-makes-for-gorgeous-pottery-surfaces/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Nerikomi'' is a contemporary Japanese term. Marbling ceramic techniques were used in Egypt and China and through the Romans to the West. Early ceramics in the [[Stoke-on-Trent]] use more than one colour of clay for decorative effect. In England this was referred to as [[agateware]]. In Japan there are a few pieces from the [[Momoyama period]], and [[Edo period]], as well as ''[[Mingei]]'' and there was an explosion of it from about 1978–1995 due probably to Aida Yusuke's advertising and to Matsui Kousei who refers to his work as ''neriage''. 

The term started being used in the 1970s to describe related kanji ''neriage''. [[Yusuke Aida]] was on a television commercial for [[Nescafé]] and it seems to have entered the vocabulary at about that time when his nerikomi coffee cups were available to the first people contacting the advertisers.

It was used in the [[Tang Dynasty]] in 7th century [[China]] there are at least two Chinese characters to describe variations of this technique (one surface, one structural).&lt;ref&gt;http://gingerbreadsquaregallery.com/ArtGlass/Thivo/Thivo-bio/thivo-bio.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://iweb.tntech.edu/wpitelka/gallery/techniques/techniques.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
Slabs of different clays or clays colored with stains or oxides, are stacked, folded, pressed into logs, sliced, and arranged to form a vessel.  In this way, the numerous stacked layers appear as fine undulating lines embedded in a surrounding color in the finished vessel.&lt;ref&gt;http://ceramicartsdaily.org/ceramic-supplies/ceramic-colorants-ceramic-supplies-2/creating-neriage-blocks-decorating-with-colored-clay-patterns/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter René Oscar Bally''' (9 May 1895 in [[Schönenwerd]], Switzerland – 26 July 1980 in [[Nairobi]]) was a Swiss botanical illustrator, botanist and taxonomist. &lt;ref&gt;http://cssaarchives.com/PETER%20BALLY%20BIOGRAPHY.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; {{botanist|P.R.O.Bally|Peter René Oscar Bally|border=0|inline=1}}

Peter Bally received formal training in neither taxonomy nor botanical illustration, but studied chemistry at first, a position with the [[League of Nations]] taking him to [[Albania]] and [[Bombay]] in 1923/24 in order to test a possible antidote for malaria. By 1930 he was working in [[Tanzania]] for an oil company, and studying medicinal and poisonous plants of the region. His botanical interests led to a study of plants, with an emphasis on succulents, in the semi-desert areas of eastern Africa. By 1938 he had been appointed government botanist at the herbarium of the [[Coryndon Museum]] in Nairobi. He bought a small piece of land on the outskirts of the town and busied himself with constructing a house and establishing a garden of indigenous plants. By 1943 he undertook botanising expeditions to [[Eritrea]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Somalia]] [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Sudan]], [[Tanzania]], [[Uganda]] and [[Zimbabwe]]. In 1960 he relocated to [[Swaziland]] and worked on the genus ''[[Aloe]]'' accompanied at one time by [[Gilbert Reynolds]], the ''Aloe'' specialist.

In 1957 he returned to Europe, working for some time on the [[ Alexandre Marnier-Lapostolle|Marnier-Lapostolle]] collection at the [[Jardin botanique "Les Cèdres"|Jardin Botanique Lès Cedres]] in [[Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat]], and then for some 12 years at the [[Conservatory and Botanical Garden of the City of Geneva|Conservatoire et Jardin Botanique]] in Geneva. 

Returning to Kenya in 1969 Peter Bally indulged in his botanical interests, becoming a familiar visitor at the Coryndon Museum Herbarium renamed the [[East African Herbarium]], and holding more than 700,000 plant specimens with field notes.

Species named for him include: ''[[Adenia ballyi]]'', ''[[Aloe ballyi]]'', ''[[Ceropegia ballyana]]'', ''[[Euphorbia ballyana]]'', ''[[Euphorbia ballyi]]'', ''[[Euphorbia proballyana]]'', ''[[Kalanchoe ballyi]]'', ''[[Sansevieria ballyi]]'' and ''[[Echidnopsis ballyi]]'', also ''[[Ballya zebrina]]'' (Chiov. ex Chiarugi) Brenan which later became a synonym of ''[[Aneilema zebrinum]]'' Chiov. ex Chiarugi. He described numerous species in the genera ''[[Aloe]]'', ''[[Caralluma]]'', ''[[Ceropegia]]'', ''[[Echidnopsis]]'', ''[[Euphorbia]]'', ''[[Pseudolithos]]'', ''[[Monadenium]]'', ''[[Pseudolithos]]'', ''[[Rhytidocaulon]]'', ''[[Sansevieria]]'', ''[[Senecio]]'' and ''[[Stapelia]]''.

'''Prabhashvara''' is the [[color]] of the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of [[Gautama Buddha]].&lt;ref&gt;The Buddhist Channel (D.C. Ranatunga, Sunday Times), April 29, 2007[http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=43,4030,0,0,1,0]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual [[spectrum]] of his aura consists of five colors:

* 'nila' ([[Sapphire (color)|sapphire blue]])
* 'pita' ([[Gold_(color)#Golden_yellow|golden yellow]])
* 'lohita' ([[crimson]])
* 'odata' ([[white]])
* 'manjesta' ([[Scarlet_(color)|scarlet]])

The mixture of those five colors is believed to be Prabhashvara but it is depicted as separate strips of the five colors.

'''Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger''' or '''Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the (II)''' is the [[notname]] given to an artist or workshop to whom or which are attributed about 200 small still lifes likely dating to the late 16th and early 17th century. The artist's works rely on combinations of a limited number of motifs in rather simple to quite elaborate compositions.  The motifs in the paintings are rendered in a rather naive and decorative manner.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/nl/explore/artists/483442 Pseudo-Jan van Kessel] at the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the Flemish influence in the works hints at a Flemish artist or an artist who trained with a Flemish artist, the artist is believed to have been active in southern Europe, probably Italy.&lt;ref name=chris&gt;[http://www.christies.com/lotfinder/paintings/pseudo-jan-van-kessel-ii-grapes-apples-5988666-details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5988666&amp;sid=f0ada0e2-206b-4be7-9ba3-462b1dd06653 Pseudo Jan van Kessel II (active second half 17th century), ''Grapes, apples, peaches in a blue and white porcelain bowl, with strawberries in a broken porcelain bowl on a stone ledge, with a monkey; and Grapes and peaches in a basket on a raised stone ledge, with a melon, figs and a turtle''] at Christie's&lt;/ref&gt;

==Identification of the oeuvre==
[[File:Pseudo-Jan van Kessel II - Still life of fruit with a monkey and a dog.jpg |thumb|288px|''Still life of fruit with a monkey and a dog'']]
None of the works attributed to Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger are authographed.  A large part of the oeuvre was catalogued in Klaus Ertz and Christa Nitze-Ertz, ''Die Maler Jan van Kessel : Jan van Kessel der Ältere 1626-1679 : Jan van Kessel der Jüngere 1654-1708 : Jan van Kessel der 'Andere' ca. 1620-ca. 1661: kritische Kataloge der Gemälde'', Lingen : De Luca, 2012 as the work of [[Jan van Kessel the Younger]].  However, Jan van Kessel the Younger's small known authentic oeuvre is different in style and execution and substantially higher in quality than the works, which have now been attributed to Pseudo Jan van Kessel the Younger. For the sake of convenience, the [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD) catalogued paintings by Pseudo-Jan van Kessel II previously (until 2017) as 'studio of [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]]'.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

The artist is believed to have been working in southern Europe, likely Italy, during the late 16th and early 17th century.&lt;ref name=chris/&gt;  The themes and style of the works suggest that the artist was Flemish or of Flemish descent or was trained in the Flemish style.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

The artist should be distinguished from the artist referred to as [[Pseudo van Kessel]], who painted subjects that resemble those of [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]], particularly in the color palette, and in whose work the influence of [[Osias Beert]] and [[Jacob van Es]] is obvious. This Pseudo van Kessel was possibly a Flemish artist by the name of Raffo Morghen or the German painter Gorthard de Wedig (Cologne 1583-1641).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dejonckheere-gallery.com/en/Kessel_Pseudo-5.html?m=1&amp;id=72 Pseudo van Kessel, ''Still life with copperware, fruit and a butterfly''] at Gallery De Jonckheere&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
[[File:Pseudo-Jan van Kessel II - Still life of a basket of roses, vegetables and guinea pigs.jpg|thumb|290px|''Still life of a basket of roses, vegetables and guinea pigs'']]
The works attributed to Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger often occur in pairs and occasionally in larger sets.  They are typically small in size and mostly painted on unmarked copper, occasionally on walnut panels, while one is executed on slate. The copper supports, as well as the fact that several of the works have an Italian provenance, suggest that these works were painted in Southern Europe, probably in Italy.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

Pseudo-Jan van Kessel the Younger occasionally borrowed motifs from Flemish examples, but only in one instance (a pair of gurnards) from [[Jan van Kessel the Elder]], with whose oeuvre there is no further direct relationship. The variety in quality of execution and their apparent mass production suggest that these still lifes were the product of a studio, rather than of one individual artist.&lt;ref name=rkd/&gt;

'''''Purity of Diction in English Verse''''' was written by [[Donald Davie]] and first published by [[Chatto &amp; Windus]] in 1952.  It was Davie's first book, and was followed three years later by a sequel: ''[[Articulate Energy]].''  In 1992 Penguin published both books together in a single volume with a new foreword.  

The book was written for the most part in [[Plymouth]], and Davie put into it much of what he had learned at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].

The '''Royal Danish Theatre''' ('''RDT''', [[Danish language|Danish]]: '''''{{lang|da|Det Kongelige Teater}}''''') is both the national Danish performing arts institution and a name used to refer to its old purpose-built venue from 1874 located on [[Kongens Nytorv]] in [[Copenhagen]]. The theatre was founded in 1748, first serving as the theatre of the king, and then as the theatre of the country. The theatre presents [[opera]], the [[Royal Danish Ballet]], [[European classical music|classical music]] concerts (by the [[Royal Danish Orchestra]], which dates back to 1448), and [[drama]] in several locations.

The Royal Danish Theatre organization is under the control of the [[Danish Ministry of Culture]], and its objectives are to ensure the staging of outstanding performances that do justice to the various stages which it controls.

'''''Saint George and the Princess''''' is a fresco by the Italian master [[Pisanello]], located in the Pellegrini Chapel of the church of [[Sant'Anastasia (Verona)|Sant'Anastasia]], [[Verona]], northern [[Italy]].  It is one of the most notable works of the [[International Gothic]] painting.

==History==
The work was commissioned by the Pellegrini family, as testified by Andrea Pellegrini's testament of 1429. The external fresco, only partially preserved, was part of a cycle decorating the whole chapel.

The date of the work is uncertain. It is generally assigned to the period between the painter's return from Rome in 1433 and his departure to [[Ferrara]] in 1438. The terracotta decoration of the chapel is documented as existing in 1436 and the frescoes are perhaps from the same period, although the two works would hardly coexist. Some scholars date it to 1444-1446, after the [[Council of Ferrara]], due to details connected to the Byzantine diplomats who took part in the latter (such as the horse with broken nostrils used by the Byzantine Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]], or the style of some figures' hats). Such details could be however come from [[Manuel II Palaiologos]]' procession at the [[Council of Constance]] (1414–1418): similar elements existed in the lost frescoes by Pisanello in [[St. John Lateran]], documented by some surviving  drawings based on those frescoes.

The fresco was long exposed to water seepages from the ceiling of the church, and was severely damaged, especially in the left part which contains the dragon. The surviving part was detached from the wall in the 19th century, but this caused the loss of the metallic and gilt decorations.

==Description==
The fresco was formed by two parts: the right one, with [[St. George]] leaving the Princess of [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] (Trabzon), which is in good conditions; and the left one, with the dragon in the sea, which is nearly lost.

The surviving section shows the moment of St. George's legend in which he is mounting his horse (shown from the rear) before sailing to kill the dragon which was to devour  the daughter of the city's king. Behind the princess, on the right, are three horses with knights, and a crouched ram. On the left are a hound and a [[companion dog]].
[[File:Pisanello 010.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Detail of the hung men.]]
The painting is highly detailed in the armors, the harnesses, and the garments of the princess and her following. The princess has an elaborated hairdo, with bends holding a large mass of hair; the latter began very highly on the brow, according to a style which was popular in the early 15th century, obtained by cutting the hair on the brow and the temples with a lit candle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Federico |last=Zeri|authorlink=Federico Zeri|title= Un velo di silenzio|publisher=Rizzoli |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The princess' dress is a sumptuous one in cloth and fur. The animals show Pisanello's passion for the portrayal of natural elements. 

The left part is occupied by a procession of curious people, depicted in smaller proportions, who have gathered near the place where George's boat is ready to sail off. Their face show a variety of portraits, which were accurately studied as testified by the numerous drawings executed by Pisanello and his workshop (now mostly housed in the Vallardi Codex, at the Cabinet des Dessins of the [[Louvre Museum]] in [[Paris]]). Among them are two grotesque faces, perhaps inspired by the descriptions of [[Ottoman Turks]] who were besieging [[Constantinople]], or perhaps by the older accounts of the [[Golden Horde]].
[[File:Pisanello 007.jpg|thumb|250px|Detail of a knight with horse.]]
The upper part features a high cliff with an idealized depiction of Trabzon with rich architectures of towers, spires of religious buildings and, on the far right, a castle.  As typical of International Gothic, there are some macabre and grotesque elements: outside the city walls are two hung men, one with his hose fallen. The latter were perhaps inspired by the daily experience of the author at Piazza delle Forche in Florence ("Gallows Square").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Renzo|last=Chiarelli|page=83|title= L'opera completa di Pisanello|publisher=Rizzoli |location=Milan |year=1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some original color details are lost: these include the tempera layer above the face, which now have become pale white; the sky, now heavily darkened; the silver of the armors, obtained by metal insertions, has now disappeared leaving a nearly black surface.

In the damaged section of the fresco, only a few details have survived. The most significant of these is a [[salamander]] walking among the bones and other remains of the dragon's victims.

[[File:San Serapio, por Francisco de Zurbarán.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Francisco de Zurbarán]], ''The Martyrdom of Saint Serapion'' 1628, 120 × 103 cm, [[Oil on canvas]], [[Wadsworth Atheneum]], [[Hartford, Connecticut]]]]
'''''Saint Serapion ''''' or '''''The Martyrdom of Saint Serapion''''' is a 1628 oil on canvas painting by the Spanish artist [[Francisco Zurbarán]] (1598–1664). The work was commissioned by the [[Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy|Mercedarian Order]] to hang in the ''De Profundis'' (funerary chapel) hall of their monastery in [[Seville]] (now [[Museum of Fine Arts of Seville]]).&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Alison. "[http://living.scotsman.com/features/Beyond-the-pale.2424217.jp Beyond the pale]". ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 3 May 2003. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brenson"&gt;Brenson, Michael. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/09/25/arts/monastic-masterpieces-from-zurbaran-at-met.html?pagewanted=all Monastic Masterpieces from Zurbaran at Met]". ''[[New York Times]]'', 25 September 1987. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Zurbarán is noted for his portrayals of penitent or martyred monks and saints.  Critic Tom Lubbock used this painting to illustrate a difference in the way the martyrdom of two different saints were depicted.  He contrasted the understated and calm depiction of St. Serapion's violent death, with the equally or more violent death of the [[Jesuit]] priest and martyr Saint [[Edmund Campion]] (1540–1581) who was publicly [[hanged, drawn and quartered]] in London in December 1581.&lt;ref name="Lubbock"&gt;Lubbock, Tom. "[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/great-works/de-zurbaran-francisco-saint-serapion-1628-904905.html de Zurbaran, Francisco: Saint Serapion (1628)]". ''[[The Independent]]'', 22 August 2008. Retrieved on 24 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  The art critic draws a comparison in the manner of depiction of Campion's death and that of [[Serapion of Algiers|Saint Serapion of Algiers]] (1179–1240), a [[Mercedarian]] [[friar]] who fought in the [[Third Crusade]] of 1196 and was later martyred.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, Matthew; Bunson, Margaret; Bunson,  Stephen. ''Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints''. Our Sunday Visitor Publishing, 2003. 743&lt;/ref&gt;

Saint Serapion is depicted by Zurbarán in a quasi-crucified pose,&lt;ref name="Lubbock" /&gt; standing with each hand bound by ropes and chain to an overhead horizontal pole. According to Michael Brenson of the ''[[New York Times]]'', his head "has shifted from the realm of the robe to the realm of the cape, which supports the head and seems to have the potential to lift it to the sky".&lt;ref name="Brenson" /&gt; The painting stops at the figure's knee level, while the strain placed on his arms is indicated by the heavy hanging folds of the drapes of the cloth hanging from left shoulder and right outstretched arm.&lt;ref name="Lubbock" /&gt; The saint is identified by text on a small note placed to the left of his chest area.&lt;ref name="Kleiner"&gt;Kleiner, 667&lt;/ref&gt;

The work makes strong use of [[chiaroscuro]] in the Spanish [[Tenebrist]] tradition of [[Jusepe de Ribera]]. The dominance of the white paint used to render the cloth creates a sense of tranquility, while the tension of the painting is derived from the dark shade created from the deep folds of the robes. In 2003, Scottish painter [[Alison Watt (Scottish painter)|Alison Watt]] wrote, "Each fold has been pared down to the basic elements of light and shade. As a viewer you are seduced by this simplicity, only to realise you have been duped. Zurbarán has elevated the humble fabric of the robes of Saint Serapion to a divine level with pure, magnificent white."&lt;ref name="Watt"/&gt;

There is an allusion to Zurburán's depiction of Saint Serapion in the poem [http://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poem/15741%20Meditations%20in%20an%20Emergency "Meditations in an Emergency"]{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by the mid-twentieth century American poet [[Frank O'Hara]]:

The Treasury '''Section of Painting and Sculpture''' (later known as the  '''Section of Fine Arts'''), commonly known as the Section, was established in 1934 and administered by the Procurement Division of the [[United States Department of the Treasury]].  It continued until 1943,&lt;ref&gt; Park, Marlene and Gerald E. Markowitz, ‘’Democratic Vistas: Post Offices and Public Art in the New Deal’’, Temple University Press, Philadelphia, 1984 p. xii&lt;/ref&gt; ending with the death of its director, [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]].

== Overview ==
Like the [[Works Progress Administration]], the Section was part of a government project aimed at providing work for Americans throughout the [[Great Depression]] during the 1930s. The Section's main function was to select high quality art to decorate public buildings in the form of [[murals]], making art accessible to all people. Because post offices were usually visited by everyone, they were the places selected to display these projects.  Commissioned artists were provided with the guidelines and themes for each project, and scenes of local interest and events were generally represented.  The muralist movement was inspired by the [[Mexican murals|Mexican muralists]], but Section murals did not portray the harsh social or economic realities of the time. Rather, they celebrated historical events and courageous acts. Many of these murals have disappeared, or fallen into disrepair, others have been restored thanks to renewed interest in their historical and artistic significance.&lt;ref name="Raynor"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Raynor, Patricia | work=Enroute | volume=6 | number=4 | date=October–December 1997 | title=Off The Wall: New Deal Post Office Murals | url=http://postalmuseum.si.edu/research/articles-from-enroute/off-the-wall.html | publisher=[[National Postal Museum]], [[Smithsonian Institution]], USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Painters of these murals include [[Ralf Henricksen]], [[Henrietta Shore]] and [[Suzanne Scheuer]].

In existence during the [[Great Depression]] in the [[United States]], the Section of Painting and Sculpture was a [[public art]] program administered by the Procurement Division of the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]] as part of President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]].  Like other New Deal public art programs, the Section (as it was commonly called) was designed to increase employment among artists, but it was unusual in awarding commissions competitively, based on artistic talent.  In total, the Section commissioned more than 1,300 murals and 300 sculptures, many of which were placed in [[post office]]s throughout the [[United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsa.gov/Portal/gsa/ep/contentView.do?programId=8996&amp;channelId=-17423&amp;ooid=18893&amp;contentId=18963&amp;pageTypeId=8199&amp;contentType=GSA_BASIC&amp;programPage=%2Fep%2Fprogram%2FgsaBasic.jsp&amp;P=WPB GSA: Federal Art Programs] summary prepared by the [[General Services Administration]]. Retrieved May 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
The Section was created in 1934 and led by [[Edward Bruce (New Deal)|Edward Bruce]].  Bruce had also led the Treasury Department's [[Public Works of Art Project]], the first federal art program, created in 1933 after the American painter [[George Biddle]] suggested the idea to President Roosevelt.  Other federal art programs followed, including the [[Federal Art Project]] (created in 1935 by the [[Works Progress Administration]], an independently operating federal agency) and the [[Treasury Relief Art Project]] (created in 1935 with funds granted by the WPA to the Treasury Department).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wpamurals.com/history.html  History of New Deal Art Projects]. Retrieved May 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Section of Painting and Sculpture was renamed as the Section of Fine Arts in 1939 and operated until 1942.

The Section’s primary objective was to "secure suitable art of the best quality available for the embellishment of public buildings." Artworks created under the Section of Fine Arts were site-specific murals and sculptures for newly constructed federal buildings and post offices.  1% of the costs of each new federal building was set aside to fund the program.&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;

==Art==
Unlike the other New Deal art programs, the Section awarded commissions through competitions and paid artists a lump sum for their work.  Competitions were open to all artists, regardless of economic status, and artists' proposals were reviewed without identifying the name of the artist who had made the submission.&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;  

The Section sought entries that reflected local interests and events, and the Section encouraged the artists to think of the communities, not the Section, as the artists' "patron."&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;  Indeed, artists awarded commissions were encouraged to visit the community to ensure that their murals reflected the community.  Although many of the artists did not make such visits, it was common for artists to correspond with the town (as well as the Post Office Department and the Section). Some local communities rejected the approved designs, and the artists would work to respond to these concerns and save their commissions.&lt;ref name="Raynor" /&gt;

The program also encouraged artists to reflect the building’s function. For example, the [[William Jefferson Clinton Federal Building]], constructed in the early 1930s as the headquarters for the U.S. Post Office Department and one of the first buildings to receive works of art under this program, contains 25 murals created with support from the Section intended to depict the history of mail delivery and the settlement of the [[Western United States|American West]]. These murals have been the subject of complaints about stereotypes of women, Native Americans, African Americans, and rural Americans, which were addressed by the [[General Services Administration]].&lt;ref name="GSA Clinton Art"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.gsa.gov/m/vpb/01028/art.html |title=Where's the Art |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=[[General Services Administration]] |access-date=2015-06-19 |quote= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618235716/http://m.gsa.gov/m/vpb/01028/art.html |archive-date=2015-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
In 1939, under the [[Reorganization Act of 1939|Reorganization Act]], all Treasury Department and WPA arts programs were incorporated into the [[Federal Works Agency]], but the outbreak of [[World War II]] and other factors were soon to end the programs. Edward Bruce died of a heart attack in January 1943. By the end of 1943, all of the New Deal art programs had been shut down.

'''Sexism in video gaming''' is prejudiced behavior or [[discrimination]] based on [[sex]] or [[gender]] as experienced by people who play and create [[video game]]s, primarily women. This may manifest as [[sexual harassment]] or in the way [[Gender representation in video games|genders are represented in games]], such as when characters are presented according to gender-related tropes and stereotypes.

The demographics of [[video game culture]] have changed since the 1980s and 90s, when video games were perceived as something of interest mainly to young men. Women make up about half of all game players as of the 2010s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=2014 Essential Facts About the Computer and Video Game Industry|date=April 2014|publisher=[[Entertainment Software Association]]|page=3|url=http://www.theesa.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/ESA_EF_2014.pdf|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This change, as well as publicized incidents of harassment such as the [[Gamergate controversy]] in 2014, have contributed to industry professionals and media increasingly paying attention to issues related to sexism in video gaming.

==Harassment==

=== Form ===
Harassment can involve sexist insults or comments, death or rape threats, demanding sexual favors in exchange for virtual or real money, or criticism of the presence of women and their interests.&lt;ref name= BBC&gt;{{cite web|last=Fletcher|first=James|title=Sexual harassment in the world of video gaming|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18280000|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, female players are also [[stalking|stalked]], whether online or offline.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

Women are sometimes marginalized as "intruders", as it is assumed they do not play video games that aren't associated with female players such as [[the Sims]], [[music video game]]s or [[casual games]]. Conversely, insults towards men focus mainly on their alleged lack of manliness for playing "girl games" or disliking violent games.&lt;ref name="pricec"&gt;{{cite web|author=Emily Matthew|title=Sexism in Video Games: There Is Sexism in Gaming|url=http://blog.pricecharting.com/2012/09/emilyami-sexism-in-video-games-study.html|publisher=Price Charting|date=2012-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, women may face offensive behavior at conventions, competitions or in video games stores. It may affect female gamers, journalists or [[video game developer|game developers]], even when they are invited to talk at a conference or to present a game.&lt;ref name="szfrauen"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/frauenrollen-in-computerspielen-sexspielzeug-1.1554509|title=Frauenrollen in Computerspielen – Sexspielzeug – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="süddeutsche"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/digital/sexismus-in-videospielen-wo-feminismus-als-terrorismus-gilt-1.1389210|title=Sexismus in Videospielen – Wo Feminismus als "Terrorismus" gilt – Digital – Süddeutsche.de|work=Süddeutsche.de|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="inrocks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lesinrocks.com/2013/03/19/actualite/le-milieu-geek-bien-trop-sexiste-11375418/|title=Les Inrocks – Le milieu geek, bien trop sexiste ?|work=Les Inrocks|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the release of the [[NES]], video games advertisements have been accused of strengthening this tendency by targeting only men.&lt;ref name="no girls" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huma"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.humanite.fr/medias/jeux-video-et-machisme-c-est-loin-d-etre-fini-554125|title=Playstation 4 (PS4) et Xbox One: la surenchère sexiste – L'Humanité|work=L'Humanité|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, women stopped being represented playing video games in advertisement and scantily clad women started being used on game covers and ads.&lt;ref name="no girls"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/features/2013/12/2/5143856/no-girls-allowed|title=No girls allowed – Polygon|work=Polygon|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women saw their non-sexualized female character designs rejected, and others reported [[sexual harassment]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name="guard twit"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1reasonwhy: the hashtag that exposed games industry sexism|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2012/nov/28/games-industry-sexism-on-twitter|author=Mary Hamilton|date=November 28, 2012|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite web|title=#1ReasonWhy: Women Take to Twitter to Talk about Sexism in Video Game Industry|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/11/27/1reasonwhy-women-take-to-twitter-to-talk-about-sexism-in-video-game-industry|date=November 27, 2012|publisher=[[Time Magazine|Time]] Newsfeed|accessdate=29 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 survey created by the International Videogame Developers Association about the satisfaction of working in video game development, results show that females claimed insubordination from subordinate male colleagues, a preference for white males in management position, and a preference for males in hiring and promotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edwards|first1=Kate|last2=Weststar|first2=Johanna|last3=Meloni|first3=Wanda|last4=Pearce|first4=Celia|last5=Legault|first5=Marie-Josée|title=Developer Satisfaction Survey 2014 Summer Report|url=http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|website=gameqol.org|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211032252/http://gameqol.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/IGDA%20DSS%202014-Summary%20Report_released.pdf|archivedate=December 11, 2014|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Women remain outsiders in video game industry"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burrows|first1=Leah|title=Women remain outsiders in video game industry|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2013/01/27/women-remain-outsiders-video-game-industry/275JKqy3rFylT7TxgPmO3K/story.html|website=Boston Globe|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same survey, many female developers complained about how peers did not take their video game credentials into serious consideration and reported invitations to "meetings" that were actually romantic dates.

Sexual harassment occurs frequently in many online settings relating online video games. Specifically, 65% of women report harassment and statistically receive three times as much derogatory or insulting remarks than men. With anonymity masking gamers, women are susceptible to extreme misogynistic and violent remarks.&lt;ref&gt;Digitized Lives, T.V. Reed&lt;/ref&gt;

Video games conferences have been criticised for using sexualised advertising such as '[[Promotional model|booth babes]]', creating a demeaning image of women, and for failing to stop harassment of female attendees. This has led some to adopt or share codes of conduct for managing these issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/forum/thread/242422 |title=Booth Babes and the Expo |publisher=Eurogamer.net |date=2012-10-03 |accessdate=2013-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abc&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverstein |first=Jonathan |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/story?id=1558683 |title=Sexy 'Booth Babes' Under Siege – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2006-02-02 |accessdate=2014-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Penny Arcade"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAX Code of Conduct|url=http://east.paxsite.com/safety-and-security|website=Penny Arcade|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Duhaime |first=Arielle |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/10/5294440/why-cant-ces-quit-booth-babes |title=Why can't CES quit booth babes? |publisher=The Verge |date=2014-01-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelion |first=Leo |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-21373094 |title=BBC News – CES 'booth babe' guidelines revised but ban rejected |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2013-02-10 |accessdate=2014-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frequency ===
Insults are frequent in [[Online game|online gaming]]. However, according to Stephen Toulouse (moderator of the online gaming service [[Xbox Live]]), between 2007 and 2012 women were the most frequent target of harassment.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Leary|first=Amy|title=In Virtual Play, Sex Harassment Is All Too Real|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/02/us/sexual-harassment-in-online-gaming-stirs-anger.html|accessdate=12 August 2012|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, data from [[Riot Games]] lists racism and homophobia at the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Using science to reform toxic player behavior in League of Legends|author=Dennis Scimeca|date=May 16, 2013|work=Ars Technica|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/05/using-science-to-reform-toxic-player-behavior-in-league-of-legends/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, derogatory words for homosexuality are used almost constantly in online gaming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2010/01/13/homophobia-and-harassment-in-the-online-gaming-age|author=Nathan Meunier|date=January 13, 2010|title=Homophobia and harassment in the online gaming age|work=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, a study of the Ohio University showed that the same person playing [[Halo 3]] online with a male and a female profile using recorded voice messages received three times more negative comments with the female profile, despite similar game scores. Even welcoming everybody at the beginning of a game could lead to sexist insults against the female profile.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.fr/culture/74637/jeux-video-etude-sexisme-joueurs|title=Jeux vidéo: une étude confirme le sexisme des joueurs – Slate.fr|work=Slate.fr|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pacific"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://psmag.com/social-justice/halo-3-gamers-are-often-sexist-too-61564|title=Study: Female Gamers Receive Verbal Abuse From Male Gamers – Pacific Standard: The Science of Society|work=Pacific Standard|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study of Halo 3 player interactions found that less skilled male players display a tendency to make frequent, nasty comments to female gamers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dewey|first1=Caitlin|title=Men who harass women online are quite literally losers, new study finds|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-intersect/wp/2015/07/20/men-who-harass-women-online-are-quite-literally-losers-new-study-finds/|work=Washington Post|date=July 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers suggested that the poorly performing males "attempt to disregard a female's performance and suppress her disturbance on the hierarchy to retain their social rank."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kasumovic|first1=Michael M.|last2=Kuznekoff|first2=Jeffrey H.|last3=Ponti|first3=Giovanni|title=Insights into Sexism: Male Status and Performance Moderates Female-Directed Hostile and Amicable Behaviour|journal=PLOS ONE|date=15 July 2015|volume=10|issue=7|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0131613|pages=e0131613|pmid=26176699|pmc=4503401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from 2006 showed that 83.4% of gamers had seen the words "gay" or "queer" used as derogatory names, and that 52.7% of gay gamers perceived the gaming community as "somewhat hostile" while 14% perceived it as "very hostile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/article/Gay-rights-group-plans-talk-on-silencing-slurs-by-3224946.php|title=Gay rights group plans talk on silencing slurs by online gamers|date=July 16, 2009|author=Kim, Ryan|work=SFGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should "return to the kitchen", along with other slurs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waterlow|first1=Lucy|title='Rape and death threats are common': Women gamers reveal the vile online abuse they receive EVERY DAY from men who say they should 'get back in the kitchen'|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3454588/Women-gamers-reveal-vile-online-abuse-receive-DAY-men-say-kitchen.html|publisher=DailyMail|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Distribution of computer and video gamers in the United States from 2006 to 2017, by gender|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/232383/gender-split-of-us-computer-and-video-gamers/|website=Statista|publisher=Electronic Software Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, “almost reaching parity” with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsanz.org.nz/journal/docs/WSJNZ291Todd64-67.pdf|last1=Todd|first1=Cherie|website=WSJNA291Todd|publisher=WSANZ|accessdate=24 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics have stated that there is an increasing pervasiveness of the sexual harassment of women in the video game community. A study conducted by Kate O'Halloran in 2017 found that women receive an almost amplified amount of harassment in the setting of online video games than they do in real life, whereas preferential treatment is given to men by other men. The difference in the treatment of women further diminishes the desire of women to participate in video games, or, as O'Halloran found, to completely conceal their gender identity and allow other players to assume their gender. Liliana Braumberger, a participant in O'Halloran's study, states that this stems from the fact that the men who engage in this form of sexual harassment have the invisibility and anonymity that comes with participating in an online server, and that men have a certain sense of entitlement that leads to the invisibility of women. She feels that this discrimination and erasure potentially have the same effects on other people who do not identify as men, not necessarily just women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Halloran|first1=Kate|title=‘Hey dude, do this’: the last resort for female gamers escaping online abuse|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2017/oct/24/hey-dude-do-this-the-last-resort-for-female-gamers-escaping-online-abuse|website=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
Events in 2007 to 2017 brought sexual harassment in video gaming to mainstream media's attention in the United-States,&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; United Kingdom and Germany:&lt;ref name="szfrauen"/&gt;

* In 2007, Kathy Sierra, a technology blogger, was forced to move her household after receiving repeated rape threats and death threats and then having her home address published online and packages sent to her home in attempt to spook her. She feared for her safety so much that she canceled her speaking engagements and stopped writing and blogging. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mantilla|first=Karla|date=2013|title=Gendertroling: Misogyny Adapts to New Media|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/23719068?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|journal=Feminist Studies|volume=39|pages=|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In February 2012, the behavior of a [[Tekken]] team coach against a female player of his team during a [[Capcom]] competition named Cross Assault provoked an outrage.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt; He interrogated her about her bra size, asked her to remove her shirt, took a webcam to film her breasts and her legs, smelled her and discussed her appearance during the live broadcast of the tournament on the internet.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt; He then stated that sexual harassment and the fighting game community are "one and the same thing" and that it would be "ethically wrong" to remove sexual harassment from the community.&lt;ref name="penny arcade"&gt;{{cite web|last=Kuchera|first=Ben|title=Sexual harassment as ethical imperative: how Capcom’s fighting game reality show turned ugly|url=http://penny-arcade.com/report/editorial-article/sexual-harassment-as-ethical-imperative-the-ugly-side-of-fighting-games|work=The Penny Arcade Report|accessdate=20 April 2012|date=2012-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a few days without any reaction from the sponsoring company, the female player eventually gave up the competition.&lt;ref name="venturebeat cross"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/02/29/cross-assault-sexual-harassment-controversy-overshadows-on-screen-combat/|title=Cross Assault sexual harassment controversy overshadows on-screen combat – GamesBeat – Games – by Marcos Valdez (Community Writer)|work=VentureBeat|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capcom later issued an apology and stated that "any inappropriate or disrespectful comments will not be tolerated during filming".&lt;ref name="giant bomb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giantbomb.com/articles/when-passions-flare-lines-are-crossed-updated/1100-4006/|title=When Passions Flare, Lines Are Crossed [UPDATED] – Giant Bomb|work=Giant Bomb|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team coach also apologized afterwards.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;

She was hesitant to jump into multiplayer and practiced by herself before going online. And once she was online, she would generally have a good time and dominate the public leaderboards, but the gamer is almost universally assumed to be a 'he,' People would complement her like, 'hey well done bro, hey dude, do this.' she said that they are just using male language to address her.

== Effects ==

A study performed by Jesse Fox et al. suggested that due the [[Proteus effect]], manifesting a sexualized character in a video game can have adverse mental effects. They designed a study in which 86 women from West Coast university played a [[virtual reality]] game. Women who used sexualized characters that looked like them had a higher [[rape myth]] acceptance than those in other conditions, which is the validation of incorrect and stereotypical ideas about rape that [[blame the victim]], and increased body-related thinking which can lead to increased [[self-objectification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fox|first1=Jesse|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experiences of self-objectification via avatars.|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|date=2013|volume=29|pages=930–938|display-authors=etal|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2012.12.027}}&lt;/ref&gt; When players immerse themselves into the games they are playing, it allows them to watch their behaviors from an external viewpoint. For some, they become more pleased with their avatar in the video game and it makes them feel good because they get to be the person they want to be. They lose sight of their physical self and match their modified self in the game. Yee and Bailenson found, in a study, that when the players manifest an attractive character, they are more open to talking to another character and will open up more. When women, especially, take over more sexualized characters, they begin to center on the more physical and sexual features, and their opinion start to support the materialization and sexualization of women.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/detail/detail?vid=1&amp;sid=f2e07096-3845-4e7d-9513-0e443ffe3778@sdc-v-sessmgr01&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=S074756321200369X&amp;db=edselp|title=The embodiment of sexualized virtual selves: The Proteus effect and experie...: Discovery Service for Loyola Marymount Univ|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Fredrickson and Roberts created the idea of objectification theory, stating that it was an environment when cultures press both girls and women to socialize in a way that they will begin to form ideas that they should be looked at as objects. It takes away their self worth and causes them to think they are only in their society to be looked at for their bodies, with a purely sexual use. Women begin to hold onto this perspective and believe that their appearance is most important and how they are valued. Combined with the Proteus effect, it is expected that a woman who chooses a more sexualized avatar will objectify themselves more than one who chooses a non-sexualized avatar.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In another study, 181 students from a private [[liberal arts]] college in North Carolina were tested. The group exposed to highly sexualized images, from video games (in comparison to [[control group]]), was more tolerant to sexual harassment but showed the same rape myth acceptance.&lt;ref name="DillBrown2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|last2=Brown|first2=Brian P.|last3=Collins|first3=Michael A.|title=Effects of exposure to sex-stereotyped video game characters on tolerance of sexual harassment|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|volume=44|issue=5|year=2008|pages=1402–1408|issn=0022-1031|doi=10.1016/j.jesp.2008.06.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar study was done in France, studying young adults being exposed to sexist materials in video games. The sample filled out a survey, which compared how much time they spent playing video games and their attitudes towards women. The results showed that when narrowed down to gender and socioeconomic levels, a connection was made between stronger sexist views and a higher amount of time spent playing video games.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bègue|first=Laurent|last2=Sarda|first2=Elisa|last3=Gentile|first3=Douglas A.|last4=Bry|first4=Clementine|last5=Roché|first5=Sebastian|date=2017-03-31|title=Video Games Exposure and Sexism in a Representative Sample of Adolescents|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5374198/|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00466|issn=1664-1078|pmc=5374198|pmid=28408891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karen E. Dill and Kathryn P. Thill state that adolescents, particularly boys and those who play games, are ignorant of the adverse impacts of detestable media content, and therefore ignorant of the when they are affected adversely.  Theories such as the [[cultivation theory]], [[social cognitive theory]], ambivalent sexism theory, and hegemonic masculinity theory all aid Dill and Thill in discussing the repercussions of perpetuating gender stereotypes in media like video games. Cultivation theory is key to the analysis of sexism in video games, because it is the idea that when an individual is exposed long-term to multimedia, their understanding of their reality can change into becoming more similar to the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Breuer|first=Johannes|last2=Kowert|first2=Rachel|last3=Festl|first3=Ruth|last4=Quandt|first4=Thorsten|date=April 2015|title=Sexist Games=Sexist Gamers?

They write that "Gender portrayals of video game characters reinforce a sexist, patriarchal view that men are aggressive and powerful and that women are not healthy, whole persons, but sex objects, eye candy and generally second-class citizens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dill|first1=Karen E.|title=Video Game Characters and the Socialization of Gender Roles:  Young People's Perceptions Mirror Sexist Media Depictions.|journal=Sex Roles|date=2007|volume=57|pages=851–864|doi=10.1007/s11199-007-9278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Jeffrey Kuznekoff and Lindsey Rose, the fact that gamers experience misconstrued portrayals of appearance, violence, and sexual objectification can impact their understanding and communication with other gamers, especially female gamers. In addition, these gender portrayals become increasingly prominent because of the mass appeal and number of users of online multiplayer games. They found that the female voice received nearly three times as many directed negative comments than the male voice or control. They also found that there was no correlation between the number of directed negative comments and the skill level of the other player.  On several occasions, the female voice received strong sexist replies for phrases such as "hi everybody" or "alright team let's do this" despite the female voice having almost the same win percentage as the male voice (56% to 61%, respectively). Additionally, they found that when the other player responded with a positive remark, they were more likely to ask questions. Overall, Kuznekoff and Rose found that there were hypernegative effects with hostile targeting of the female voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuznekoff|first1=Jeffrey H.|title=Communication in multiplayer gaming: Examining player responses to gender cues|journal=New Media &amp; Society|date=2012|volume=15|issue=|pages=541–556|doi=10.1177/1461444812458271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a three-year German study of 824 gamers found, when controlling for age and education, that there was no correlation between sexist attitudes and time spent playing video games, or with preference for video game genres.

A study was conducted on 154 Italian male high school volunteers. They were tasked with playing one of three different types of games. The first was ''Grand Theft Auto''. Females in this game are secondary, usually strippers and prostitutes that are used as sexual objects by players. The second was ''Half Life 1'' and ''Half Life 2''. Although this game is violent, the female character plays a lead role and is not depicted in a sexist or sexual manner. Lastly, there was ''Dream Pinball 3D'' and ''Q.U.B.E. 2'', which contain no violence or sexuality. Afterward, the volunteers were shown one of two pictures that showed females as victims of violence. Participants then rated whether they felt sympathetic, moved, compassionate, tender, warm, softhearted, disregarded or indifferent on a scale of 1, ''not at all'' to 7, ''very much''. The study concluded that those that identified strongly with the male characters in the sexist-violent video game, ''Grand Theft Auto'', showed the least amount of empathy towards the female violence victims. "The portrayal of men in the media as socially powerful and physically violent reinforces assumptions about how men and boys should act in society, as well as how they should treat women and girls. Exposure to sex-typed media characters can have real world consequence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gabbiadini|first=Alessandro |last2=Riva | first2=Paolo | first3=Luca | last3=Andrighetto | first4=Chiara | last4=Volpato | first5=Brad J. | last5=Bushman|date=13 April 2016|title=Acting like a Tough Guy: Violent-Sexist Video Games, Identification with Game Characters, Masculine Beliefs, &amp; Empathy for Female Violence Victims|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=11|pages=1–14|via=|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0152121 | pmid=27074057 | pmc=4830454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A prevailing perception is that the gaming industry is not fit for female workers because of sexism. According to Richard Wilson, CEO of [[The Independent Game Developers' Association|TIGA]], "typically, 80% of the workforce is qualified to degree level or above, but the proportion of women studying subjects such as computer science or games programming courses is low.

'''''Synthesia''''' is a piano keyboard trainer for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] which allows users to play a [[MIDI keyboard]] or use a [[Keyboard (computing)|computer keyboard]] in time to a [[MIDI file]] by following on-screen directions, much in the style of ''[[Keyboard Mania]]'' or ''[[Guitar Hero]]''. Additionally, Synthesia can be paired with MIDI keyboards that have illuminated keys, or with [[virtual piano|virtual]] [[player piano]] on screen, which some people believe makes learning piano easier for beginners. It was originally named '''''Piano Hero''''', due to the similarity of gameplay with ''[[Guitar Hero]]''; this was until [[Activision]] (the owners of the rights to ''Guitar Hero'') sent a [[cease and desist]] to the program's creator, Nicholas Piegdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.destructoid.com/activision-sends-piano-hero-fella-cease-and-decist-denies-plans-of-lawyer-hero-30825.phtml | work=Destructoid | accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=Activision sends Piano Hero fella cease and decist; denies plans of Lawyer Hero}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.synthesiagame.com/cease.aspx | work=Synthesia Official Website | accessdate=2012-01-04 | title='Piano Hero' Name Cease And Desist From Activision}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''Synthesia''' was started around 2006 by American developer Nicholas Piegdon, and was originally named "Piano Hero". Hosted as an [[open-source software|open-source]] project on [[sourceforge]], it was released under [[MIT license]].

The program was originally [[Windows]]-only, but after a donation-drive in early 2007, the game was ported to [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tuaw.com/2007/02/12/you-want-piano-hero-on-your-mac/ | work=TUAW| accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=You want Piano Hero on your Mac?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cease and desist letter===
In a letter dated 26 March 2007 Activision requested that Piegdon ''"immediately cease any and all use of the "Piano Hero" name in connection with the distribution and promotion of [his] video game and agree not to use such in the future"''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://kotaku.com/gaming/piano-hero/piano-hero-gets-cease-and-desist-249940.php | work=Kotaku | accessdate=2008-01-10 | title=Piano Hero Gets Cease and Desist | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120709194743/http://kotaku.com/249940/piano-hero-gets-cease-and-desist?tag=gamingpianohero | archivedate=2012-07-09 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Piegdon responded by hosting a contest for a new name for the project, resulting in the name, Synthesia, suggested by Daniel Lawrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.synthesiagame.com/faq.aspx#what_is | work=Synthesia Official Website| accessdate = 2014-08-18 | title=Synthesia Name Change | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071024124344/http://www.synthesiagame.com/faq.aspx#what_is | archivedate = 2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continued development as closed-source project ===
After May 2012 Piegdon decided to stop releasing the [[source code]], as he saw the potential commercial value of the program. However the last open-source release version 0.6.1b is still available for download.

In the continued commercial version the basic functionality was still freeware. 
A "Learning Pack" key could be purchased to unlock the freemium additional features, such as a [[sheet music]] display mode. 
In December 2014, with Version 10 of Synthesia, the ability to use the program without purchasing it was removed, with the exception of several playable included demo MIDIs.

==Features==
Synthesia has support for playing custom MIDI files, as well as linking with MIDI devices. Synthesia will rate the player's performance afterwards, and give a score which can be submitted to an online scoreboard. Synthesia also has a paid "Learning Pack" that allows users to view music in [[Musical notation]], as well as multiple practice features, such as "Melody Practice" which pauses the song whenever the user misses a note, and only continues when the right note is played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.synthesiagame.com/ | work=Synthesia Official Website| accessdate=2012-03-10 | title=Synthesia Features}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">The {{nihongo|'''Tampei Photography Club'''|丹平写真倶楽部}} was a group based in [[Osaka]] from 1930 until 1941 that promoted [[avant-garde]] and, toward the end, socially concerned photography.

The group was founded around the photographer [[Bizan Ueda]], among photographers who bought their supplies from the Tampei Pharmacy ({{nihongo2|丹平薬局}}, ''Tanpei yakkyoku'') in [[Shinsaibashi]], Osaka. The founding members included [[Terushichi Hirai]], [[Kōrō Honjō]] and [[Tōru Kōno]]; these were soon augmented by [[Kaneyoshi Tabuchi]], [[Nakaji Yasui]], and others.

The group's first exhibition was held in 1931 but it was the second exhibition, in 1932, that caused a stir, with avant-garde works. The club exhibited frequently; its first exhibition in [[Tokyo]] held in 1935.

The club's 23rd exhibition, in March 1941, featured a series titled ''Refugee Jews'' ({{nihongo2|流氓ユダヤ}}, ''Ryūbō Yudaya'')&lt;ref&gt;Also translatable as ''Displaced Jews,'' etc., often referred to as ''Wandering Jew.''&lt;/ref&gt; of 22 photographs depicted exiles from eastern Europe who were living in [[Kobe]]. Six of these were by Yasui, who had instigated two photography sessions for it earlier that month.&lt;ref&gt;''Tanjō hyakunen: Yasui Nakaji: Shashin no subete'' / ''Nakaji Yasui 1903&amp;ndash;1942: The Photography,'' p. 136; the same book shows a larger number of Yasui's own photographs in the series are shown on pp.&amp;nbsp;136&amp;ndash;42.&lt;/ref&gt; The club was forced to close later that year.

The club reemerged after the war, but did not regain its prominence.

'''''The Death of Nelson''''' is a painting by the American artist [[Benjamin West]] dated 1806.

In 1770, West painted ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]''. This was not an accurate representation of the event, but rather an idealisation, and it included people who were not present at the event. Nevertheless, it became very popular, and West painted at least five copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html |title=A National Treasure in New Brunswick: James Barry's The Death of General Wolfe - The Phenomenon |accessdate=23 April 2010 |publisher=[[New Brunswick Museum]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090619055946/http://website.nbm-mnb.ca/Wolfe/ThePhenomenon.html |archivedate=June 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1801, three years after the [[Battle of the Nile]], West met [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]], who told him how much he admired the painting of Wolfe, and asked why he had not produced any more similar paintings. West, who was at the time the President of the [[Royal Academy]], replied that he had found no subject of comparable notability. Nelson then expressed the desire that he would be the subject of West's next similar painting. In 1805, Nelson was killed in the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and, within six months, West had created this painting.&lt;ref name=west&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.aspx?id=274| title = Artwork of the Month, October 2005| accessdate = 22 April 2010| publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Again it proved to be popular. When West exhibited it in his studio, within just over a month it was seen by 30,000&amp;nbsp;members of the public.&lt;ref name=west/&gt;

Again it was an idealisation of the subject. Although West took considerable trouble about the accuracy of details in his painting, basing the portraits on over 50&amp;nbsp;survivors of the battle, he produced, as he admitted himself, a picture "of what might have been, not of the circumstances as they happened".&lt;ref name=west/&gt; West created two more paintings with Nelson as the subject, ''The Death of Lord Nelson in the Cockpit of the Ship "Victory"'' and ''The Immortality of Nelson'', both of which are in the [[National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nmm.ac.uk/mag/pages/mnuExplore/BrowseByArtist.cfm?action=artistTitle&amp;name=Benjamin%20West&amp;lettera=W| title = Pictures by Benjamin West| accessdate = 22 April 2010| publisher = [[National Maritime Museum]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other artists produced works depicting the same event. One of these was [[Arthur William Devis]] who painted ''[[The Death of Nelson, 21 October 1805]]'', now also in the National Maritime Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=BHC2894|title = Trafalgar|accessdate = 22 April 2010|publisher = [[National Maritime Museum]]|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110608220224/http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=BHC2894|archivedate = 8 June 2011|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was ''[[The Death of Nelson (Maclise painting)|The Death of Nelson]]'' by [[Daniel Maclise]], a large wall painting in the [[Palace of Westminster#Royal Gallery|Royal Gallery]] of the [[Palace of Westminster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.explore-parliament.net/nssMovies/01/0100/0100_.htm| title = 'The Death of Nelson' by Daniel Maclise|accessdate = 22 April 2010|publisher = Explore Parliament}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finished study for this work is owned by the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]], [[Merseyside]], England, having been bought by the gallery in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displayPicture.asp?venue=2&amp;ID=37&amp;a=1#furtherreading| title = Artwork of the Month - October 2000| accessdate = 22 April 2010|publisher = [[National Museums Liverpool]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

West's painting is in [[Oil painting|oil]] on [[canvas]] and measures {{convert|182.5|cm|in|0}} by {{convert|247.5|cm|in|0}}. It was presented to the Walker Art Gallery by Bristow H.

'''''The Holy Family with Angels'''''  (1645) is an [[oil painting]] on canvas by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] landscape painter [[Rembrandt]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is now in the collection of the [[Hermitage Museum]].

== Description ==
This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1915, who wrote; "94. THE HOLY FAMILY WITH THE ANGELS. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm. 72.]]; [[Wilhelm von Bode|Bode]] 321 ; [[Eugène Dutuit|Dutuit]] 59; [[Alfred von Wurzbach|Wb.]] 391 ; B.-HdG. 251. In the foreground of [[St. Joseph|Joseph's]] carpenter's workshop, the Virgin Mary sits on a low chair, holding a large open book on her left arm. She rests her left foot on a foot-warmer and leans over to the left to draw the green curtain of the cradle in which the Child lies asleep under a red fur-lined coverlet. Mary wears a deep red gown and dark blue skirt, and a white kerchief and cap. Behind her in half-shadow, Joseph, in a brown working-dress, is shaping a [[yoke]] with his axe. From above to the left child-angels flutter down, throwing a bright light on the Virgin and the cradle. Full-length figures, almost half life-size. Signed on the left at foot, "Rembrandt f. 1645 " ; canvas, 46 1/2 inches by 36 inches. An old copy without the angels was in the possession of an English dealer in 1899, and afterwards in the possession of a New York dealer. Another copy without the angels was in the sale : --London, June 7, 1912, No. 23 (£15 : 15s.). A pen-drawing for the picture is in the collection of [[Leon Bonnat]], Paris ; reproduced by Lippmann-Hofstede de Groot, No. 20. A study in chalk for the Child in the cradle was in the collection of [[John Postle Heseltine|J. P. Heseltine]], London, and is now in the collection of H. Oppenheim, London ; reproduced by Lippmann, No. i883. Engraved by J. Vendramini, 1836 ; by J. Sanders in outline in F. Labenski, ''Description de I'Ermitage'', i. 28. Etched by N. Mossoloff in ''Les Rembrandts de l' Ermitage''. Lithographed by H. Robillard in Gohier Desfontaines and P. Petit, ''Galerie de l' Ermitage'', i. 4. Mentioned by [[Carel Vosmaer|Vosmaer]], pp.&amp;nbsp;262, 537 ; by Bode, pp.&amp;nbsp;474, 599 ; by Dutuit, p.&amp;nbsp;38 ; by [[Emile Michel|Michel]], pp.&amp;nbsp;299, 566 [228-9, 441] ; by [[Gustav Friedrich Waagen|Waagen]], ''The Picture Gallery of the Hermitage'', p.&amp;nbsp;177.

In the Hermitage Palace, Petrograd, 1901 catalogue, No. 796 [said by Sm. in 1836 to be well worth £2100]."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn06hofsuoft#page/76/mode/1up  Entry 94 for ''''The Holy Family with Angels''] in Hofstede de Groot, 1915&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unusual portrayal in home setting==
[[File:Harmensz van Rijn Rembrandt - Святое семейство - Google Art Project (cropped for mother and child).jpg|thumb|The baby Jesus is wearing a skull-cap with band known as a [[valhoed]] and he is propped up with cushions into a sitting position as was customary at that time]]
Rembrandt portrays the [[Holy Family]] as a typical family of [[Amsterdam]] in his day. In the foreground Jesus is asleep in the same style of wicker crib that can be seen in period paintings of mothers with babies by [[Pieter de Hooch]]. Mary looks up from her book to take a peek at the sleeping child under the crib curtain (Dutch: ''klamboe''). In the background Joseph is working on making a [[yoke]].The yoke refers both to the coming of the Lord according to [[Isaiah]]  ("For the yoke of their burden, and the bar across their shoulders, the rod of their oppressor, you have broken as on the day of Midian"), as well as the words of Jesus according to [[Matthew the Apostle]] ("Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls, for my yoke is easy and my burden is light").

'''''The Punishment of Lust''''' ({{lang-it|La Punizione della Lussuria}}), also called '''''The Punishment of Luxury''''', is an 1891 oil painting on canvas by the artist [[Giovanni Segantini]].

==Background==
Giovanni Segantini was born in the [[County of Tyrol]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], but his parents died when he was still young and he went to live with his step-sister Irene in [[Milan]]. Hoping that she and Giovanni could become Italian citizens, Irene revoked their Austrian citizenship, but for some reason failed to apply for Italian citizenship, leaving the pair stateless. Giovanni soon ran away and after a time living on the streets was sent to a reformatory, where he was encouraged to take up art.&lt;ref name=bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.segantini-museum.ch/en/giovanni-segantini/biography.html|title=Segantini Museum : Biography|work=segantini-museum.ch|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1873, his half-brother Napoleon took him in and put him to work in his photographic studio. He worked as a decorative artist and studied at [[Accademia di Belle Arti di Brera]] in Milan and had some success as a painter, but eventually grew tired of the strictures of the academy and relocated with his family to [[Brianza]] in the foothills of the [[Alps]] where he adopted a more naturalistic approach, capturing the landscapes and daily lives of the workers.&lt;ref name=bio/&gt;

A visit from the art dealer and critic Vittore Grubicy, who had discovered and promoted Segantini, around the end of 1886 or beginning of 1887 with news of the latest developments in painting sparked Segantini's interest in [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Divisionism]]; from that point on he began to produce more [[Allegory|allegorical]] studies, often set in the bleak, snowy, clearly lit landscapes of the Alps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nicodimgallery.com/exhibitions/the-punishment-of-lust-and-luxury|title=The Punishment of Lust and Luxury|work=nicodimgallery.com|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
Segantini painted ''The Punishment of Lust'' in 1891; it was an early entry in a thematic series on ''cattive madri'' (bad mothers) that he produced between 1891 and 1896 (the ''Nirvana'' cycle). Taking its inspiration from ''Nirvana'' published in 1889 – supposedly a translation from the 12th-century Indian [[Panghiavahli of Maironpada]] by the librettist [[Luigi Illica]] but probably written by him or translated from an intermediate work –&lt;ref name=LaL&gt;{{cite book | author = Cheney, Liana De Girolami | date=2010 | chapter = Giovanni Segantini's Nirvana Series: Symbols of ''Luxuria'' and ''Vanitas'' [Ch. 24] | editor = Neginsky, Rosina | title=Symbolism, Its Origins and Its Consequences | pages = 426–454, esp. 438 | location = Newcastle upon Tyne | publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing | url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7WwnBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA438| access-date=12 May 2016| isbn=9781443824521 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it shows women being punished for preferring a life of ease over a life of duty by being suspended among the barren landscape of the Alps.&lt;ref name=Walker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolmuseums.org.uk/picture-of-month/displaypicture.aspx?id=30|title=Artwork highlights – The Punishment of Lust, also known as The Punishment of Luxury, 1891, by Giovanni Segantini (1858–1899)|work=liverpoolmuseums.org.uk|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Segantini had been raised a Catholic and believed strongly that the role of a woman was to be a mother; the ''Nirvana'' cycle illustrates the outcome for women who failed in that role and contrasts with Segantini's ''Angel'' cycle, produced over the same period, that depicts the reward derived from being a good mother.&lt;ref name=LaL/&gt; Segantini's longing for the mother who had died when he was a child coupled with his resentment at losing her may be reflected in this dichotomous approach to the theme of motherhood.&lt;ref name=LaL/&gt;

The women in ''The Punishment of Lust'' are suggested to have aborted or lost their children, and although this would have been a sin in Segantini's eyes, he has still treated them sympathetically and, as the poem ''Nirvana'' does, hints that they could be redeemed; they are suspended in a dream-like state and, though stark, the landscape is not unpleasant –  Segantini regarded the mountains as his spiritual home – and the inclusion of withered trees symbolises a possible return to life in a new spring.&lt;ref name=Walker/&gt;

==History==
The painting was purchased by the [[Walker Art Gallery]] in [[Liverpool]] in 1893, but before it was exhibited it was retitled ''The Punishment of Luxury'' (''Luxury'' being an archaic translation of the Italian ''lussuria'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/culturalinstitute/asset-viewer/the-punishment-of-lust/ZgFteROYPN6p9A?hl=en|title=The Punishment of Lust – Giovanni Segantini – Google Cultural Institute|work=google.com|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the mention of "Lust" was thought to be too challenging for a Victorian public.&lt;ref name=Walker /&gt;

The British band [[Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark]] named their 13th studio album ''[[The Punishment of Luxury (album)]]'' as a play on the title of Segantini's canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/music/2018/03/08/for-four-decades-omd-has-cast-wary-eye-toward-future/WdZAsvOdUSajWGuncGwFHP/story.html | title = For four decades, OMD has cast a wary eye toward the future | date = 8 March 2018 | accessdate = 10 July 2018 | publisher = ''The Boston Globe'' | author = Maura Johnston }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Song of Love''''' (also known as '''''Le chant d'amour''''' or '''''Love Song'''''; 1914) is a painting by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Metaphysical art|metaphysical painter]] [[Giorgio de Chirico]]. It is one of the most famous works by de Chirico and an early example of the [[Surrealism|surrealist]] style, though it was painted ten years before the movement was "founded" by [[André Breton]] in 1924. 

It depicts an outdoor architectural setting similar to other works by de Chirico at this time. This time however, the main focus is a small wall on which is mounted a [[Ancient Greek sculpture|Greek sculpted]] head and a surgeon's glove. Below it is a green ball. On the horizon is the outline of a locomotive, an image that recurs several times during this period of de Chirico's career.

The '''Tomb of Louis XII and Anne of Brittany''' is a large and complex silver-[[gilding|gilt]] and marble sculptured [[funerary art|funerary monument]]. Its design and build are usually attributed to the [[Juste family|Juste brothers]]&lt;ref name="C168"&gt;Cohen (1968), p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; although the work of several other hands can be distinguished. Design for and installed at the [[Basilica of St Denis|Saint-Denis Basilica]], France, it was commissioned in 1515 in memory of [[Louis XII of France|Louis XII]] (d. 1515, aged 52) and his queen [[Anne of Brittany]] (d. 1514, aged 36), probably by Louis' successor [[Francis I of France|Francis I]] (reigned 1515–1547), and after years of design and intensive building was unveiled in 1531.&lt;ref&gt;Giese et al (2018), p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tomb effigy represents a break from traditional representations in this format, and as an [[Early Renaissance]] work seems, in its monumentality, influenced by classical sources, especially Roman, probably borrowed from [[Andrea Sansovino]] and contemporary [[Florence|Florentine]] sculptors.

Art historian Barbara Hochstetler Meyer describes the tomb as portraying the deceased "with a verism, poignancy, and sensitivity to nature rarely equalled in the north of Europe during the sixteenth century."&lt;ref name="hm43"&gt;Hochstetler Meyer (1982), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The stone slab above the tomb shows both alive and in full flesh. Louis is seated with Anne kneeling behind him; both have their hands clasped in prayer. Unusually, the king is not wearing a crown. He had suffered prolonged illness before his death, and the impact of this is made evident by his sagging skin and decrepit muscles. Nor is his age is not shied away from; he has a long curved nose, beady and alert but swollen eyes, and a double chin.&lt;ref name="hm46" /&gt; 

The arches of the tomb contains a number of groupings of seated figures, including [[apostles]] and figures representing the seven [[seven virtues|cardinal virtues]]. Beyond them, at each corner are four larger, also seated, female figures.

[[File:Wooden toys (cropped).JPG|thumb|300px|A variety of traditional wooden [[Channapatna toys]] from India]]
A '''toy''' is an item that is used in [[Play (activity)|play]], especially one designed for such use. Playing with toys can be an enjoyable means of training young children for life in society. Different materials like wood, clay, paper, and plastic are used to make toys. Many items are designed to serve as toys, but goods produced for other purposes can also be used. For instance, a small child may fold an ordinary piece of paper into an airplane shape and "fly it". 
Newer forms of toys include interactive digital entertainment. Some toys are produced primarily as collectors' items and are intended for display only.

The origin of toys is [[prehistoric]]; [[dolls]] representing [[infant]]s, animals, and soldiers, as well as representations of tools used by adults are readily found at archaeological sites. The origin of the word "toy" is unknown, but it is believed that it was first used in the 14th century. Toys are mainly made for children.&lt;ref name=etymonline&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=toy|title=toy - Origin and meaning of toy by Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known doll toy is thought to be 4,000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/science/article/2012-01/what-oldest-toy-world|title=FYI: What Is the Oldest Toy in the World?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playing with toys is considered to be important when it comes to growing up and learning about the world around us. Younger children use toys to discover their identity, help their bodies grow strong, learn cause and effect, explore relationships, and practice skills they will need as adults. Adults on occasion use toys to form and strengthen social bonds, teach, help in therapy, and to remember and reinforce lessons from their youth.

==History==
[[File:Little horse on wheels (Ancient greek child's Toy).jpg|thumb|upright|Little horse on wheels, [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] children's toy. From a tomb dating 950–900 BCE, [[Kerameikos]] Archaeological Museum, Athens]]

Most children have been said to play with whatever they can find, such as sticks and rocks. 
Toys and games have been unearthed from the sites of ancient civilizations. They have been written about in some of the oldest literature. Toys excavated from the [[Indus valley civilization]] (3010–1500 BCE) include small carts, whistles shaped like birds, and toy monkeys which could slide down a string.&lt;ref name=Indialife&gt;[http://members.aol.com/Donnclass/Indialife.html MrDonn.org – Daily Life in Ancient India, including the mysterious Indus Valley Civilization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919170202/http://members.aol.com/Donnclass/Indialife.html |date=19 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest toys are made from materials found in nature, such as rocks, sticks, and [[clay]]. Thousands of years ago, [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] children played with [[doll]]s that had wigs and movable limbs which were made from stone, pottery, and wood.&lt;ref name=Maspero&gt;{{cite book|last=Maspero|first=Gaston Camille Charles|authorlink=Gaston Maspero|title=Manual of Egyptian Archaeology and Guide to the Study of Antiquities in Egypt|publisher=Project Gutenberg|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/14400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Ancient Greece and [[Ancient Rome]], children played with dolls made of wax or [[terracotta]], sticks, [[bow and arrow|bows and arrows]], and [[yo-yo]]s. When Greek children, especially girls, came of age it was customary for them to sacrifice the toys of their childhood to the gods. On the eve of their wedding, young girls around fourteen would offer their dolls in a temple as a rite of passage into adulthood.&lt;ref name=Powell&gt;{{cite book|last=Powell|first=Barry B.|title=Classical Myth; Third Edition|publisher=Prentice Hall|year =2001|location=Upper Saddle River, NJ|pages=33–34|isbn=0-13-088442-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliver&gt;{{cite web|last=Oliver|first=Valerie|title=History of the Yo-Yo|publisher=Spintastics Skill Toys, Inc.|year=1996|url=http://www.spintastics.com/HistoryOfYoYo.asp|accessdate=2006-10-30 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060809224918/http://www.spintastics.com/HistoryOfYoYo.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known [[mechanical puzzle]] also comes from Greece and appeared in the 3rd century BC. The game consisted of a square divided into 14 parts, and the aim was to create different shapes from these pieces. In Iran "puzzle-locks" were made as early as the 17th century (AD).

===Enlightenment era===
Toys became more widespread with the changing attitudes towards children engendered by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Children began to be seen as people in and of themselves, as opposed to extensions of their household and that they had a right to flourish and enjoy their childhood. The variety and number of toys that were manufactured during the 18th century steadily rose; [[John Spilsbury (cartographer)|John Spilsbury]] invented the first [[jigsaw puzzle]] in 1767 to help children learn geography. He created puzzles on eight themes – the World, Europe, Asia, Africa, [[Americas|America]], England and [[Wales]], Ireland and Scotland. The [[rocking horse]] (on bow rockers) was developed at the same time in England, especially with the wealthy as it was thought to develop children's balance for riding real horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsrockinghorses.co.uk/history.shtml|title=History of the Rocking Horse|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reif Spielzeug.jpg|thumb|upright|A boy with a [[Hoop rolling|hoop]]. Hoops have long been a popular toy across a variety of cultures.]]
Blowing bubbles from leftover washing up soap became a popular pastime, as shown in the painting ''The Soap Bubble'' (1739) by [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]]. Other popular toys included [[hoop rolling|hoops]], [[toy wagon]]s, [[kite]]s, [[spinning wheel]]s and [[puppet]]s. The first [[board game]]s were produced by [[John Jefferys]] in the 1750s, including ''A Journey Through Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;FRB Whitehouse (Table Games of Georgian and Victorian Days, Priory House, Herfortshire, UK, 1951)&lt;/ref&gt; The game was very similar to modern board games; players moved along a track with the throw of a [[dice]] (a [[teetotum]] was actually used) and landing on different spaces would either help or hinder the player.&lt;ref name="everydaytoys"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everydaytoys.com/collectible-toys/history-of-toys/|title=History of Toys|accessdate=2012-12-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220111708/http://everydaytoys.com/collectible-toys/history-of-toys/|archivedate=20 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nineteenth century, the emphasis was put on toys that had an educational purpose to them, such as puzzles, books, cards and board games. Religiously themed toys were also popular, including a model [[Noah's Ark]] with miniature animals and objects from other Bible scenes. With growing prosperity among the middle class, children had more leisure time on their hands, which led to the application of industrial methods to the manufacture of toys.&lt;ref name="everydaytoys" /&gt;

More complex mechanical and optics-based toys were also invented. [[Carpenter and Westley]] began to mass-produce the [[kaleidoscope]], invented by Sir [[David Brewster]] in 1817, and had sold over 200,000 items within three months in London and Paris. The company was also able to mass-produce [[magic lantern]]s for use in [[phantasmagoria]] and galanty shows, by developing a method of [[mass production]] using a copper plate printing process. Popular imagery on the lanterns included [[royal family|royalty]], [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and geographical/man-made structures from around the world.&lt;ref name="Heard"&gt;[http://www.heard.supanet.com/html/lantern_history.html Shedding some light on the magic lantern] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221231502/http://www.heard.supanet.com/html/lantern_history.html |date=21 December 2013 }}.  Mervyn Heard.  Accessed 1 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The modern [[zoetrope]] was invented in 1833 by British mathematician [[William George Horner]] and was popularized in the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Bordwell, David and Kristin Thompson, Film History: An Introduction, 3rd edition (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2010), 4. {{ISBN|978-0-07-338613-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood and porcelain [[doll]]s in miniature [[doll house]]s were popular with middle class girls, while boys played with marbles and toy trains.

===Mass market===
[[File:Hornby pt1901.jpg|thumb|Frank Hornby's 1901 patent number GB190100587A for what later became known as [[Meccano]]]]

The golden age of toy development was at the turn of the 20th century. [[Real wage]]s were rising steadily in the Western world, allowing even working-class families to afford toys for their children, and industrial techniques of precision engineering and mass production was able to provide the supply to meet this rising demand. Intellectual emphasis was also increasingly being placed on the importance of a wholesome and happy childhood for the future development of children. [[William Harbutt]], an English painter, invented [[plasticine]] in 1897, and in 1900 commercial production of the material as a children's toy began. [[Frank Hornby]] was a visionary in toy development and manufacture and was responsible for the invention and production of three of the most popular lines of toys based on [[Engineering mechanics|engineering principles]] in the twentieth century: [[Meccano]], [[Hornby Railways|Hornby Model Railways]] and [[Dinky Toys]].

Meccano was a [[Scale model|model]] construction system that consisted of re-usable metal strips, plates, [[Angle iron|angle]] [[girder]]s, wheels, axles and [[gear]]s, with [[Nut (hardware)|nuts]] and [[screw#bolt|bolt]]s to connect the pieces and enabled the building of working models and mechanical devices. [[Dinky Toys]] pioneered the manufacture of [[die-cast toy]]s with the production of toy cars, trains and ships and model train sets became popular in the 1920s. The [[Britains (toy brand)|Britain's company]] revolutionized the production of [[toy soldiers]] with the invention of the process of [[hollow casting]] in lead in 1893&lt;ref&gt;Joplin, N. (1996). ''Toy Soldiers''. London: Quintet Publishing, Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; – the company's products remained the industry standard for many years.

Puzzles became greatly fashionable as well. In 1893, the English lawyer [[s:Author:Angelo John Lewis|Angelo John Lewis]], writing under the pseudonym of Professor Hoffman, wrote a book called ''Puzzles Old and New''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzlemuseum.com/library/hoffm/hoff-bk.htm|title="PUZZLES OLD and NEW " by Professor Hoffmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contained, amongst other things, more than 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. This book grew into a reference work for puzzle games and was very popular at the time. The [[Tangram]] puzzle, originally from China, spread to Europe and America in the 19th century.

During the [[Second World War]], some new types of toys were created through accidental innovation. After trying to create a replacement for [[synthetic rubber]], the American [[Earl L. Warrick]] inadvertently invented "nutty putty" during [[World War II]]. Later, Peter Hodgson recognized the potential as a childhood plaything and packaged it as [[Silly Putty]]. Similarly, [[Play-Doh]] was originally created as a wallpaper cleaner.&lt;ref name=mit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/Invent/iow/sillyputty.html|title=On the invention of silly putty, from Lemelson-MIT Program|website=web.mit.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1943 [[Richard T. James|Richard James]] was experimenting with springs as part of his military research when he saw one come loose and fall to the floor. He was intrigued by the way it flopped around on the floor. He spent two years fine-tuning the design to find the best gauge of steel and coil; the result was the [[Slinky]], which went on to sell in stores throughout the United States.

After the [[Second World War]] as society became ever more affluent and new technology and materials (plastics) for toy manufacture became available, toys became cheap and ubiquitous in households across the Western World. Among the more well known products of the 1950s there was the Danish company [[Lego]]'s line of colourful interlocking plastic brick construction sets, [[Rubik's Cube]], [[Mr. Potato Head]], the [[Barbie doll]] and [[Action Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.localhistories.org/toys.html|title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF TOYS|accessdate=2012-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today there are computerized dolls that can recognize and identify objects, the voice of their owner, and choose among hundreds of pre-programmed phrases with which to respond.&lt;ref name=VanPatten&gt;{{cite web|last=Van Patten|first=Denise|title=A Brief History of Talking Dolls – From Bebe Phonographe to Amazing Amanda|publisher=About.com|url=http://collectdolls.about.com/od/dollsbymaterial/a/talkingdolls.htm|accessdate=2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The materials that toys are made from have changed, what toys can do has changed, but the fact that children play with toys has not.

==Culture==
The act of children's play with toys embodies the values set forth by the adults of their specific community, but through the lens of the child's perspective. Within cultural societies, toys are a medium to enhance a child's cognitive, social, and linguistic learning.&lt;ref name="Smith2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Peter K|title=Children and Play:Understanding Children's Worlds|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=West Sussex, United Kingdom|isbn=978-0-631-23521-7|pages=89–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MLLhoS7LDEkC&amp;pg=PA94&amp;lpg=PA94&amp;dq=toys+symbolism+of+other+cultures&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=VUlJGRykDj&amp;sig=moH6NCUKK_FlLHvVEeXFLuoyf-0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiDxuqSsLDQAhUD8CYKHTY0ChYQ6AEISDAH#v=onepage&amp;q=toys%20symbolism%20of%20other%20cultures&amp;f=false|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cultures, societies utilize toys as a way to enhance a child's skillset within the traditional boundaries of their future roles in the community. In Saharan and North African cultures, play is facilitated by children through the use of toys to enact scenes recognizable in their community such as hunting and herding. The value is placed in a realistic version of development in preparing a child for the future they are likely to grow up into. This allows the child to imagine and create a personal interpretation of how they view the adult world.&lt;ref name="Rossie2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rossie|first1=Jean-Pierre|title=Toys,Play, Culture, and Society. An anthrological approach with reference to North Africa and the Sahara|date=2005|publisher=SITREC|location=Stockholm|isbn=91-974811-3-0|pages=88–91|url=https://www.academia.edu/5180690/Toys_Play_Culture_and_Society._An_anthropological_approach_with_reference_to_North_Africa_and_the_Sahara|accessdate=2016-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in other cultures, toys are used to expand the development of a child's cognition in an idealistic fashion. In these communities, adults place the value of play with toys to be on the aspirations they set forth for their child. In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children's play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free to delve into the imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.&lt;ref name="Rossie2005" /&gt;

In addition, children from differing communities may treat their toys in different ways based on their cultural practices. Children in more affluent communities may tend to be possessive of their toys, while children from poorer communities may be more willing to share and interact more with other children. The importance the child places on possession is dictated by the values in place within the community that the children observe on a daily basis.&lt;ref name="Starr2013"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Starr|first1=Benjamin|title=TOY STORIES: CHILDREN'S FAVORITE TOYS AROUND THE WORLD|url=https://www.visualnews.com/2013/03/13/toy-stories-childrens-favorite-toys-around-the-world/|accessdate=2016-12-05|publisher=Visual News|date=13 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child development==
Toys, like play itself, serve multiple purposes in both humans and animals. They provide entertainment while fulfilling an educational role. Toys enhance [[cognition|cognitive behavior]] and stimulate creativity. They aid in the development of physical and mental skills which are necessary in later life.

One of the simplest toys, a set of simple wooden [[Block (toy)|blocks]] is also one of the best toys for developing minds.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} Andrew Witkin, director of marketing for [[Mega Brands]] told Investor's Business Daily that, "They help develop hand-eye coordination, math and science skills and also let kids be creative."&lt;ref name=Tsuruoka&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tsuruoka |first=Doug |title=Toys: Not All Fun And Games |journal=Investor's Business Daily |volume= |issue= |pages= |publisher= |date=5 January 2007 |url=http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=23&amp;issue=20070105 |doi= |id= |accessdate=2007-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009073731/http://www.investors.com/editorial/IBDArticles.asp?artsec=23&amp;issue=20070105 |archivedate=9 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other toys like [[marbles]], [[jackstones]], and [[ball]]s serve similar functions in child development, allowing children to use their minds and bodies to learn about [[spatial relationships]], [[cause and effect]], and a wide range of other skills.

[[File:Hitting the Ball in the Shadow of the Banana Leaves.jpg|thumb|Two children playing with [[paddle ball]]s in ''Hitting the Ball in the Shadow of the Banana'', a painting by the [[History of Chinese art|Chinese artist]] Su Hanchen (苏汉臣, active 1130s–1160s AD), [[Song Dynasty]]]]
One example of the dramatic ways that toys can influence child development involves clay sculpting toys such as [[Play-Doh]] and [[Silly Putty]] and their home-made counterparts. Mary Ucci, Educational Director of the Child Study Center of [[Wellesley College]], has demonstrated how such toys positively impact the [[physical development]], [[cognitive development]], [[Child development#Social-emotional|emotional development]], and [[social development]] of children.&lt;ref name=Ucci&gt;{{cite journal | last =Ucci | first =Mary | title =Playdough: 50 Years' Old, And Still Gooey, Fun, And Educational | journal =Child Health Alert | volume =24 | issue = | pages = | publisher = | date =April 2006 | url =http://web110.epnet.com/citation.asp?tb=1&amp;_ug=sid+50E579A7%2D22F7%2D4ED5%2DADF6%2DF699A2D5EB3B%40sessionmgr2+dbs+afh+cp+1+B804&amp;_us=mh+1+sl+%2D1+hs+False+or+Date+ss+SO+sm+KS+mdbs+afh+ri+KAAAGEIB00091355+dstb+KS+sel+False+frn+1+1CD0&amp;_uso=tg%5B0+%2D+db%5B0+%2Dafh+hd+False+op%5B0+%2D+st%5B0+%2DToys++in++Child++development++AND++DE++%22TOYS%22+ex%5B0+%2Dproximity+mdb%5B0+%2Dimh+A6B6&amp;cf=1&amp;fn=1&amp;rn=2&amp; | accessdate =2007-02-17 }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} (Note that the full-text online version requires login.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Toys for infants often make use of distinctive sounds, bright colors, and unique [[Texture (visual arts)|textures]]. Through play with toys infants begin to recognize shapes and colors. Repetition reinforces memory. [[Play-Doh]], [[Silly Putty]] and other hands-on materials allow the child to make toys of their own.

[[Educational toy]]s for school age children of often contain a [[puzzle]], problem-solving technique, or mathematical proposition. Often toys designed for older audiences, such as teenagers or adults, demonstrate advanced concepts. [[Newton's cradle]], a desk toy designed by [[Simon Prebble]], demonstrates the [[Conservation law|conservation of momentum and energy]].

Not all toys are appropriate for all ages of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=cffd4f9HBL0C&amp;q=Not+all+toys+are+appropriate+for+all+ages+of+children&amp;dq=Not+all+toys+are+appropriate+for+all+ages+of+children|title=The Mommy Guide: Real-life Advice and Tips from Over 250 Moms and Other Experts|last=Bernard|first=Susan|date=1994|publisher=Contemporary Books|isbn=9780809237975|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even some toys which are marketed for a specific age range can even harm the development of children in that range.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}

===Age compression===
"Age compression" is a toy industry term that describes the modern trend of children moving through play stages faster than they did in the past. Children have a desire to progress to more complex toys at a faster pace, girls in particular. Barbie dolls, for example, were once marketed to girls around 8 years old but have been found to be more popular in recent years with girls around 3 years old.&lt;ref name="Pressler"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pressler|first=Margaret Webb|title=Bored with her toys|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/01/AR2006040100186.html|accessdate=2 April 2006|newspaper=Washington Post|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The packaging for the dolls labels them appropriate for ages 3 and up. Boys, in contrast, apparently enjoy toys and games over a longer timespan, gravitating towards toys that meet their interest in assembling and disassembling mechanical toys, and toys that "move fast and things that fight". An industry executive points out that girls have entered the "tween" phase by the time they are 8 years old and want non-traditional toys, whereas boys have been maintaining an interest in traditional toys until they are 12 years old, meaning the traditional toy industry holds onto their boy customers for 50% longer than their girl customers.&lt;ref name="Pressler"/&gt;

Girls gravitate towards "music, clothes, make-up, television talent shows and celebrities". As young children are more exposed to and drawn to music intended for older children and teens, companies are having to rethink how they develop and market their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6xMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA69&amp;lpg=PA69&amp;dq=KID+RHINO+ADDRESSES+AGE+COMPRESSION+BY+TWEAKING+PRODUCTS,+STRATEGIES&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mb_X5MShjG&amp;sig=4H5ZmdAehHrMmsszR9ddzfpXFto&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi4mryQxrDZAhVow1kKHR-uDvcQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=KID%20RHINO%20ADDRESSES%20AGE%20COMPRESSION%20BY%20TWEAKING%20PRODUCTS%2C%20STRATEGIES&amp;f=false|title=Kid Rhino Addresses Age Compression By Tweaking Products, Strategies|last=|first=|date=|website=Billboard-Google Books|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Girls also demonstrate a longer loyalty to characters in toys and games marketed towards them.&lt;ref name="Tansel"&gt;{{cite web|last=Tansel|first=Utku|title=Effects of age compression on traditional toys and games|url=http://blog.euromonitor.com/2010/10/effects-of-age-compression-on-traditional-toys-and-games.html|publisher=Euromonitor International|accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of global toy companies have marketed themselves to this aspect of girls' development, for example, the [[Hello Kitty]] brand, and the [[Disney Princess]] franchise. Boys have shown an interest in computer games at an ever-younger age in recent years.

==Gender==
[[File:Tank toy radio.JPG|thumb|right|A toy tank with a remote control. Such toys are generally thought of as boys' toys.]]
{{main|Gender|Girls' toys and games|Boys' toys and games}}

Certain toys, such as [[Barbie]] dolls and toy soldiers, are often perceived as being more acceptable for one gender than the other. The turning point for the addition of gender to toys came about in the 1960s and 1970s. Before 1975, only about two percent of toys were labeled by gender, whereas today on the Disney store's website, considered a dominating global force for toys by researcher Claire Miller, all toys are labeled by gender.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The journal [[Sex Roles (journal)|''Sex Roles'']] began publishing research on this topic in 1975, focusing on the effects of gender in youth. Too, many psychological textbooks began to address this new issue. Along with these publications, researchers also started to challenge the ideas of male and female as being opposites, even going as far as to claim toys which have characteristics of both gender are preferable.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zosuls|first=Kristina M.|last2=Miller|first2=Cindy Faith|last3=Ruble|first3=Diane N.|last4=Martin|first4=Carol Lynn|last5=Fabes|first5=Richard A.|date=2011-06-01|title=Gender Development Research in Sex Roles: Historical Trends and Future Directions|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-010-9902-3|journal=Sex Roles|language=en|volume=64|issue=11-12|pages=826–842|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9902-3|issn=0360-0025|pmc=3131694}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A milestone for research on gender is the use of meta-analysis, which provides a way to assess patterns in a systematic way, which is especially relevant for a topic such as gender, which can be difficult to quantify.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Nature and nurture have historically been analyzed when looking at gender in play, as well as reinforcement by peers and parents of typical gender roles and consequently, gender play.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Toy companies have often promoted the segregation by gender in toys because it enables them to customize the same toy for each gender, which ultimately doubles their revenue. For example, Legos added more colors to certain sets of toys in the 1990s, including colors commonly attributed to girls such as lavender.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=bd6261e7-ba5f-4849-aaef-fb04d4e35a90@sessionmgr120&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ==#db=a9h&amp;AN=9611122255|title=Toy story: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been noted by researchers that, "Children as young as 18 months display sex-stereotyped toy choices".&lt;ref name=Caldera&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caldera|first=Yvonne M. |last2=Huston|first2=Aletha C. |last3=O'Brien|first3=Marion |title=Social Interactions and Play Patterns of Parents and Toddlers with Feminine, Masculine, and Neutral Toys|journal=Child Development|volume=60|issue=1|pages=70–76|date=February 1989|doi=10.2307/1131072|pmid=2702876|jstor=1131072}}&lt;/ref&gt; When eye movement is tracked in young infants, infant girls show a visual preference for a doll over a toy truck (d &gt; 1.0). Boys showed no preference for the truck over the doll. However, they did fixate on the truck more than the girls (d = .78).&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, G. M., Wilcox, T., &amp; Woods, R. (2009). Sex differences in infants' visual interest in toys. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 38, 427–433. doi: 10.1007/s10508-008-9430-1&lt;/ref&gt; This small study suggests that even before any self-awareness of gender identity has emerged, children already prefer sex-typical toys. These differences in toy choice are well established within the child by the age of three.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, G. M., &amp; Saenz, J. (2012). Early androgens, activity levels and toy choices of children in the second year of life. Hormones and Behavior, 62, 500–504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study done by Jeffrey Trawick-Smith took 60 different children ages three to four and observed them playing with nine different toys deemed best for development. They were allowed to play with the toys in a typical environment, a preschool classroom, which allowed for the results to be more authentic compared to research done in a lab. The researchers then quantified play quality of the children with each toy based on factors such as learning, problem solving, curiosity, creativity, imagination, and peer interaction. The results revealed that boys generally received higher scores for overall play quality than girls, and the toys with the best play quality were those identified as the most gender neutral, such as building blocks and bricks along with pieces modeling people. Trawick-Smith then concluded that the study encourages a focus on toys which are beneficial to both genders in order to create a better balance.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Trawick-Smith|first=Jeffrey|last2=Wolff|first2=Jennifer|last3=Koschel|first3=Marley|last4=Vallarelli|first4=Jamie|date=2015-07-01|title=Effects of Toys on the Play Quality of Preschool Children: Influence of Gender, Ethnicity, and Socioeconomic Status|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-014-0644-7|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|language=en|volume=43|issue=4|pages=249–256|doi=10.1007/s10643-014-0644-7|issn=1082-3301}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some parents promote gender neutral play, many parents encourage their sons and daughters to participate in sex-typed activities, including doll playing and engaging in housekeeping activities for girls and playing with trucks and engaging in sports activities for boys.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Role Stereotypes, Expectancy Effects, and Parents' Socialization of Gender Differences, Jacquelynne S.

(Eds.), Sex Differences in the Brain from Genes to Behavior (1ed., pp. 275–290).New York, NY: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; A study done by researcher Susan Witt suggests that stereotypes are oftentimes only strengthened by the environment, which perpetuates them to linger in older life.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This stereotypical attribution of sex-typical toys for girls and boys is gradually changing, with toys companies creating more gender neutral toys, as the benefits associated with allowing children to play with toys that appeal to them far outweighs controlling their individual preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://toyreviewexperts.com/gender-neutral-toys-how-they-empower-our-kids/ |title=Gender Neutral Toys: How They Empower Our Kids |work=Toy Review Experts |author= |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, many stores are beginning to change their gender labels on children's play items. Target removed all identification related to gender from their toy aisles and Disney did the same for their costumes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/31/upshot/boys-and-girls-constrained-by-toys-and-costumes.html|title=Boys and Girls, Constrained by Toys and Costumes|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|date=2015-10-30|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-09-21|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Disney store is an especially prevalent example of gender in play because they are a global identity in the toy world. A study done regarding their website found that though they have removed gender labels from their costumes, the toys online reflect more stereotypical gender identities. For example, males were associated with physicality and females were associated with beauty, housing, and caring.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Auster, Carol J., and Claire S. Mansbach. "The Gender Marketing of Toys: An Analysis of Color and Type of Toy on the Disney Store Website."''&amp;nbsp;Sex Roles'', vol. 67, no. 7-8, 2012, pp. 375-388'', Sociological Abstracts.''&lt;/ref&gt; Too, though they promote their toys as being for both genders, there is no section for boys and girls combined on their website. Those which are generally deemed for both genders more closely resemble what many would label "boy toys," as they relate closer to the stereotype of masculinity within play.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Traditions within various cultures promote the passing down of certain toys to their children based on the child's gender. In South American Indian communities, boys receive a toy bow and arrow from their father while young girls receive a toy basket from their mother.&lt;ref name="Smith2010" /&gt; In North African and Saharan cultural communities, gender plays a role in the creation of self-made dolls. While female dolls are used to represent brides, mothers, and wives, male dolls are used to represent horsemen and warriors. This contrast stems from the various roles of men and women within the Saharan and North African communities. There are differences in the toys that are intended for girls and boys within various cultures, which is reflective of the differing roles of men and women within a specific cultural community.&lt;ref name="Rossie2005" /&gt;

Research on the repercussions of gender in toys suggests that play should be encouraged to be more gender neutral in order to work towards a desegregation of the genders.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Too, researcher Carol Auster and Claire Mansbach promote that allowing children to play with toys which more closely fit their talents would help them to better develop their skills.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In terms of parental influence, a study found that parents who demonstrated some androgynous behavior have higher scores in support, warmth, and self-worth in regards to the treatment of their children.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Even as this debate is evolving and children are becoming more inclined to cross barriers in terms of gender with their toys, girls are typically more encouraged to do so than boys because of the societal value of masculinity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Economics==
[[File:Toys R Us sg.JPG|thumb|left|[[Toys "R" Us]] operated over 1,500 stores in 30 countries and has an annual revenue of US$13.6&amp;nbsp;billion]]

With toys comprising such a large and important part of human existence, it makes sense that the toy industry would have a substantial economic impact. Sales of toys often increase around holidays where gift-giving is a tradition. Some of these holidays include Christmas, Easter, [[Saint Nicholas Day]], and [[Three Kings Day]].

In 2005, toy sales in the United States totaled about $22.9&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=Tsuruoka/&gt; &lt;!-- This reference has a slightly lower figure, but isn't from as reliable a source.

Toy companies change and adapt their toys to meet the changing demands of children thereby gaining a larger share of the substantial market. In recent years many toys have become more complicated with flashing lights and sounds in an effort to appeal to children raised around television and the internet. According to [[Mattel]]'s president, Neil Friedman, "Innovation is key in the toy industry and to succeed one must create a 'wow' moment for kids by designing toys that have fun, innovative features and include new technologies and engaging content."

In an effort to reduce costs, many mass-producers of toys locate their factories in areas where wages are lower. China manufactures about 70 percent of the world’s toys and is home to more than 8,000 toy firms, most of which are located in the Pearl River Delta of Guangdong Province.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chen|first1=Dezhi|last2=Wei|first2=William|last3=Hu|first3=Daiping|last4=Muralidharan|first4=Etayankara|title=Survival strategy of OEM companies: a case study of the Chinese toy industry|journal=International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management|date=5 September 2016|volume=36|issue=9|pages=1065–1088|doi=10.1108/IJOPM-04-2015-0212}}&lt;/ref&gt; 75% of all toys sold in the U.S., for example, are manufactured in China.&lt;ref name=Tsuruoka/&gt; Issues and events such as power outages, supply of raw materials, supply of labor, and raising wages that impact areas where factories are located often have an enormous impact on the toy industry in importing countries.

Many traditional toy makers have been losing sales to video game makers for years. Because of this, some traditional toy makers have entered the field of [[electronic game]]s and even turning [[audio games]] into toys, and are enhancing the brands that they have by introducing interactive extensions or internet connectivity to their current toys.&lt;ref name = "Ibisworld"&gt;{{cite news

In addition, the rise of [[distributed manufacturing]] enables consumers to make their own toys from [[open source]] designs with a [[3-D printer]].&lt;ref&gt;Researchers run the numbers on cutting the cost of toys by 3-D printing them at home – [https://www.geekwire.com/2017/researchers-run-numbers-cutting-cost-toys-3-d-printing-home/ Geekwire]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017 consumers were already offsetting 10s of millions of dollars per year by [[3D printing]] their own toys from [[MyMiniFactory]], a single repository.&lt;ref&gt;Petersen,et al, [https://www.academia.edu/33966963/Impact_of_DIY_Home_Manufacturing_with_3D_Printing_on_the_Toy_and_Game_Market Impact of DIY Home Manufacturing with 3-D Printing on the Toy and Game Market].

==Types==
[[File:Lincoln Logs sawmill.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lincoln Logs]] have been a popular construction type toy in the U.S. since the 1920s.]]

===Construction sets===
{{Main|Construction set}}

The Greek philosopher [[Plato]] wrote that the future architect should play at building houses as a child.&lt;ref name=Hils&gt;Karl Hils, ''The Toy – Its Value, Construction and Use'', Edmund Ward Ltd., London, 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[construction set]] is a collection of separate pieces that can be joined together to create [[Scale model|model]]s. Popular models to make include cars, [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s, and houses. The things that are built are sometimes used as toys once completed, but generally speaking, the object is to build things of one's own design, and old models often are broken up and the pieces reused in new models.

The oldest and, perhaps most common construction toy is a set of simple wooden [[Toy block|blocks]], which are often painted in bright colors and given to babies and toddlers. Construction sets such as [[Lego]] bricks and [[Lincoln Logs]] are designed for slightly older children and have been quite popular in the last century. 
Construction sets appeal to children (and adults) who like to work with their hands, puzzle solvers, and imaginative sorts.

Some other examples include [[Bayko]], [[Konstruk-Tubes]], [[K'Nex]], [[Erector Set]]s, [[Tinkertoy]]s, and [[Meccano]], and generic construction toys such as [[Neodymium magnet toys]].

===Dolls and miniatures===
{{main|doll}}
[[File:Child and Doll.jpg|thumb|left|A girl and her [[doll]] in the 1900s.]]

A [[doll]] is a model of a human (often a baby), a humanoid (like [[Bert and Ernie]]), or an animal. Modern dolls are often made of cloth or plastic. Other materials that are, or have been, used in the manufacture of dolls include [[Husk|cornhusks]], [[bone]], [[Rock (geology)|stone]], wood, [[porcelain]] (sometimes called china), [[Bisque doll|bisque]], [[celluloid]], [[wax]], and even apples. Often people will make dolls out of whatever materials are available to them.

Sometimes intended as decorations, keepsakes, or [[collectible]]s for older children and adults, most dolls are intended as toys for children, usually girls, to play with. Dolls have been found in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] tombs which date to as early as 2000 BC.&lt;ref name="Maspero"/&gt;

Dolls are usually miniatures, but baby dolls may be of true size and weight. A doll or [[stuffed animal]] of soft material is sometimes called a [[plush toy]] or [[Stuffed toy|plushie]]. A popular toy of this type is the [[Teddy Bear]].
[[File:Pierre Despereax 09.19.2012 (8004871773).jpg|thumb|upright|Teddy Bear]]
A distinction is often made between dolls and [[action figure]]s, which are generally of plastic or semi-metallic construction and poseable to some extent, and often are merchandising from television shows or films which feature the characters. Modern action figures, such as [[Action Man]], are often marketed towards boys, whereas dolls are often marketed towards girls.

[[Toy soldiers]], perhaps a precursor to modern [[action figures]], have been a popular toy for centuries. They allow children to act out battles, often with toy military equipment and a castle or fort. Miniature animal figures are also widespread, with children perhaps acting out farm activities with animals and equipment centered on a toy farm.

===Vehicles===
[[File:Knatterboot.jpg|thumb|left|A [[pop pop boat|toy boat]].]]
{{main|Vehicle}}

Children have played with miniature versions of vehicles since ancient times, with toy two-wheeled [[cart]]s being depicted on [[Pottery of Ancient Greece|ancient Greek vases]].&lt;ref name=Hils/&gt; [[Wind-up toy]]s have also played a part in the advancement of toy vehicles. Modern equivalents include toy [[motor vehicle|car]]s such as those produced by [[Matchbox (toy company)|Matchbox]] or [[Hot Wheels]], miniature aircraft, toy boats, [[military vehicle]]s, and [[toy train|train]]s. Examples of the latter range from wooden sets for younger children such as [[BRIO]] to more complicated realistic [[Rail transport modeling|train models]] like those produced by [[Lionel Corporation|Lionel]], [[Doepke Toys|Doepke]] and [[Hornby Railways|Hornby]]. Larger die-cast vehicles, 1:18 scale, have become popular toys; these vehicles are produced with a great attention to detail.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Puzzles===
{{main|Puzzle}}
[[File:Rubik's cube.svg|upright|thumb|A Rubik's Cube]]
A '''puzzle''' is a [[problem]] or enigma that challenges ingenuity. Solutions to puzzle may require recognizing patterns and creating a particular order. People with a high [[inductive reasoning aptitude]] may be better at solving these puzzles than others. Puzzles based on the process of inquiry and discovery to complete may be solved faster by those with good [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]] skills. A popular puzzle toy is the [[Rubik's Cube]], invented by Hungarian [[Ernő Rubik]] in 1974. Popularized in the 1980s, solving the cube requires planning and problem-solving skills and involves algorithms.

There are many different types of puzzles, for example a [[maze]] is a type of [[tour puzzle]]. Other categories include; [[construction puzzle]]s, [[stick puzzle]]s, [[tiling puzzle]]s, [[disentanglement puzzle]]s, [[sliding puzzle]]s, [[logic puzzle]]s, [[picture puzzle]]s, [[lock puzzle]]s and [[mechanical puzzle]]s.

===Collectibles===

{{Main|Collectible}}

Some toys, such as [[Beanie Baby|Beanie Babies]], attract large numbers of enthusiasts, eventually becoming [[collectible]]s. Other toys, such as [[Boyds Bears]] are marketed to adults as collectibles. Some people spend large sums of money in an effort to acquire larger and more complete collections. The record for a single [[Pez dispenser]] at auction, for example, is US$1100.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news|last=Brown|first=Patricia Leigh|title=New Auction Gems: Common Folks; Venerable Houses Woo Unstuffy Buyers With Unstuffy Stuff|work=The New York Times|page=37|date=23 April 1995|url=https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F6061EF93B5D0C708EDDAD0894DD494D81|accessdate=2006-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotional merchandise===

Many successful films, television programs, books and sport teams have official merchandise, which often includes related toys. Some notable examples are ''[[Star Wars]]'' (a space fantasy franchise) and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], an English [[association football|football]] club.
 
Promotional toys can fall into any of the other toy categories; for example they can be dolls or action figures based on the characters of movies or professional athletes, or they can be balls, yo-yos, and [[lunch box]]es with logos on them. Sometimes they are given away for free as a form of advertising. [[Model aircraft]] are often toys that are used by airlines to promote their brand, just as [[Die cast toy|toy cars and truck]]s and [[model train]]s are used by trucking, railroad and other companies as well. Many food manufacturers run promotions where a toy is included with the main product as a [[Prize (marketing)|prize]]. Toys are also used as [[Premium (marketing)|premiums]], where consumers redeem [[Proof of purchase|proofs of purchase]] from a product and pay shipping and handling fees to get the toy.  Some people go to great lengths to collect these sorts of promotional toys.

===Digital toys===

Digital toys are toys that incorporate some form of interactive digital technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/27/business/tech-toys-that-can-make-the-video-screen-passe.html|title=Tech Toys That Go Beyond the Screen|first=Farhad|last=Manjoo|date=26 November 2014|publisher=|via=www.nytimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of digital toys include [[virtual pets]] and [[handheld electronic games]]. Among the earliest digital toys are [[Mattel Auto Race]] and the [[Little Professor]], both released in 1976.  The concept of using technology in a way that bridges the digital with the physical world, providing unique interactive experiences for the user has also been referred to as "Phygital."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phygitalien.com/what-is-phygital/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216182145/http://phygitalien.com/what-is-phygital/ |archivedate=16 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical activity===
{{Main|Physical activity}}
[[File:Jakarta old football.jpg|thumb|A boy from [[Jakarta]] with his ball. [[Ball game]]s are good exercise, and are popular worldwide.]]

A great many toys are part of active play. These include traditional toys such as [[Hoop rolling|hoop]]s, [[top]]s, [[jump rope]]s and [[ball]]s, as well as more modern toys like [[Frisbee]]s, [[foot bag]]s, [[astrojax]], and [[Myachi]].

Playing with these sorts of toys allows children to exercise, building strong bones and muscles and aiding in [[physical fitness]]. Throwing and catching balls and frisbees can improve hand–eye coordination. Jumping rope, (also known as skipping) and playing with foot bags can improve balance.

==Safety regulations==
{{main|Toy safety}}
[[File:LEGO-01.jpg|thumb|left|Toys with small parts, such as these [[Lego]] elements are required by law to have warnings about choking hazards in some countries.]]

Many countries have passed [[safety standards]] limiting the types of toys that can be sold. Most of these seek to limit potential hazards, such as [[choking]] or [[fire hazard]]s that could cause injury. Children, especially very small ones, often put toys into their mouths, so the materials used to make a toy are regulated to prevent poisoning. Materials are also regulated to prevent fire hazards. Children have not yet learned to judge what is safe and what is dangerous, and parents do not always think of all possible situations, so such warnings and regulations are important on toys.

For toy safety, every country has its own regulations. But since the [[globalization]] and opening of markets, most of them try to harmonize their regulations. The most common action for younger children is to put toys in their mouths. This is why it is of utmost importance to regulate chemicals which are contained in the paintings and other materials children's products are made of.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsletter.sgs.com/eNewsletterPro/uploadedimages/000006/sgs-safeguards-02812-korea-plans-to-limit-five-chemicals-in-childrens-products-a4-en-12.pdf "Korea plans to limit five chemicals in children's products"], SGS SafeGuards, Retrieved 02/2012&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Countries or trade zones such as the [[European Union]] regularly publish lists to regulate the quantities or ban chemicals from toys and juvenile products.

There have also been issues of toy safety regarding lead paint. Some toy factories, when projects become too large for them to handle, outsource production to other less known factories, often in other countries. Recently, there were some in China that America had to send back. The subcontractors may not be watched as closely and sometimes use improper manufacturing methods. The U.S. government, along with mass market stores, is now moving towards requiring companies to submit their products to testing before they end up on shelves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/11/business/worldbusiness/11lead.html | work=The New York Times | title=Why Lead in Toy Paint? It's Cheaper | first=David | last=Barboza | date=11 September 2007 | accessdate=2010-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal==
[[File:Crashbobby 02-small.JPG|thumb|Some communities require recycling of the batteries in toys such as [[qfix|qfix robot "crash-bobby"]].]]

When toys have been outgrown or are no longer wanted, reuse is sometimes considered{{Citation needed|date=December 2016}}. They can be donated via many charities such as [[Goodwill Industries]] and the [[Salvation Army]], sold at [[garage sale]]s, [[auction]]ed, sometimes even donated to museums. However, when toys are broken, worn out or otherwise unfit for use, care should be taken when disposing of them. Donated or resold toys should be gently used, clean and have all parts.&lt;ref name=Goodwilldonationguidelines&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goodwill.org/page/guest/about/howweoperate/donations/dosanddonts|title=Goodwill Industries International - Dos and Don'ts|date=13 August 2005|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050813014318/http://www.goodwill.org/page/guest/about/howweoperate/donations/dosanddonts|archivedate=13 August 2005|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before disposal of any battery-operated toy, batteries should be removed and recycled; some communities demand this be done. Some manufacturers, such as [[Little Tikes]], will take back and recycle their products.

In 2007, massive [[2007 Chinese export recalls|recalls of toys produced in China]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LIPTON|first=ERIC S.|title=As More Toys Are Recalled, Trail Ends in China|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/19/business/worldbusiness/19toys.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=19 June 2007|work=The New York Times|date=19 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; led many U.S.-based charities to cut back on, or even discontinue, their acceptance of used toys. Goodwill stopped accepting donations of any toys except stuffed animals, and other charities checked all toys against government-issued checklists.&lt;ref name=Recall&gt;{{cite news

The [[WEEE directive|WEEE directive (Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment)]], which aims at increasing re-use and recycling and reducing electronic waste, applies to toys in the United Kingdom as of 2 January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dti.gov.uk/innovation/sustainability/weee/page30269.html|title=EC Directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) - DTI|date=23 June 2007|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623125558/http://www.dti.gov.uk/innovation/sustainability/weee/page30269.html|archivedate=23 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toy use in animals==
It is not unusual for some animals to play with toys. An example of this is a dolphin being trained to nudge a ball through a hoop. Young chimpanzees use sticks as dolls – the social aspect is seen by the fact that young females more often use a stick this way than young male chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/09/101220-chimpanzees-play-nature-nurture-science-animals-evolution/|title=Chimp "Girls" Play With "Dolls" Too—First Wild Evidence|date=22 December 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Current Biology, DOI: 10,1016 / j . cub.2010.11.024&lt;/ref&gt; They carry their chosen stick and put it in their nest. Such behaviour is also seen in some adult female chimpanzees, but never after they have become mothers.
