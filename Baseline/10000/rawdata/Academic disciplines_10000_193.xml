      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7961">In [[communication theory]], the '''Allen curve''' is a graphical representation that  reveals the exponential drop in frequency of communication between engineers as the distance between them increases. It was discovered by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Professor [[Thomas J. Allen]] in the late 1970s.

A related and highly significant finding of Allen's was his identification of the key role of information gatekeepers. Often such interlocutors were poorly recognized by management and yet conveyed vital concepts from just the right people to just the right other people in the organization.


== Discovery ==

During the late 1970s, Allen undertook a project to determine how the distance between engineers’ offices affects the frequency of technical communication between them. The result of that research produced what is now known as the Allen Curve, revealing a strong negative correlation between physical distance and the frequency of communication between work stations. The finding also revealed the critical distance of 50 meters for weekly technical communication.

This finding was originally documented in Allen’s book, ''Managing the Flow of Technology''.&lt;ref name="Book1"&gt;{{cite book

== Recent development ==
With the fast advancement of internet and sharp drop of telecommunication cost, some{{who|date=July 2018}} wonder about the application of the Allen Curve in today's corporate environment. In his recently co-authored book, Allen examined this question and the same still holds true. He says&lt;ref name="Book2"&gt;{{cite book

:"''For example, rather than finding that the probability of telephone communication increases with distance, as face-to-face probability decays, our data show a decay in the use of '''all''' communication media with distance (following a "near-field" rise).''" [p. 58]

He further explains&lt;ref name="Book2"/&gt;
:"''We do not keep separate sets of people, some of whom we communicate with by one medium and some by another. The more often we see someone face-to-face, the more likely it is that we will also telephone that person or communicate by another medium.''" [p. 58]

== Significance ==

With the wide acknowledgment of importance of communication to innovation, the Allen Curve has been taught and cited in all management literature about innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Early life and education ==
Townsend-Small was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. She grew up in [[Holliston, Massachusetts]], and graduated from [[Holliston High School]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} While attending [[Skidmore College]] in 1997, Townsend-Small spent a semester at the [[Marine Biological Laboratory]] in [[Woods Hole, Massachusetts]] as part of the Semester in Environmental Science program.&lt;!-- The source cited here only states that she attended Skidmore; it mentions nothing about the Marine Biological Laboratory --&gt;{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.edu/ses/alumni/ses-alumni-list-by-college/|title=SES Alumni List by College|website=www.mbl.edu|access-date=2018-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this semester she produced a research project investigating the use of [[nitrogen]] stable [[isotope]]s as tracers of wastewater inputs to groundwater, and has continued to work with isotopes and marine environments since.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In 1998, Townsend-Small graduated ''[[Magna cum Laude|magna cum laude]]'' from [[Skidmore College]], receiving a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's degree]] in both [[English literature]] and [[environmental biology]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; She received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Marine Science|marine science]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] in 2006, where she had done dissertation research investigating carbon cycling and its relationship with climate in the [[Amazon River]] headwaters of [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=2006|others=|title=Carbon and nitrogen cycling in the Peruvian Andean Amazon|url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/13069|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career and research ==
Townsend-Small's dissertation research focused on examining the [[particulate organic matter]] (POM) carried downstream by rivers from the [[Andes|Andes Mountains]] in [[Peru]] to the [[Amazon River]], paying special attention to the elemental and isotopic compositions of [[carbon]] and [[nitrogen]] in the POM.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; After receiving her PhD, Townsend-Small worked at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] as a Postdoctoral Researcher studying the connection between [[Climate change|changing climate]] and the export of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]], and dissolved nutrients in rivers of the [[Alaska]]n Arctic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend-Small|first=Amy|last2=McClelland|first2=James W.|last3=Max Holmes|first3=R.|last4=Peterson|first4=Bruce J.|date=2010-05-09|title=Seasonal and hydrologic drivers of dissolved organic matter and nutrients in the upper Kuparuk River, Alaskan Arctic|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10533-010-9451-4|journal=Biogeochemistry|language=en|volume=103|issue=1-3|pages=109–124|doi=10.1007/s10533-010-9451-4|issn=0168-2563}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Townsend-Small began working as a Postdoctoral Scholar and Project Scientist in the Department of Earth System Science at the [[University of California, Irvine|University of California Irvine]], where she conducted research regarding urban [[greenhouse gas]] and water budgets in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Townsend-Small|first=Amy|last2=Pataki|first2=Diane E.|last3=Czimczik|first3=Claudia I.|last4=Tyler|first4=Stanley C.|date=2011|title=Nitrous oxide emissions and isotopic composition in urban and agricultural systems in southern California|url=https://utah.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/nitrous-oxide-emissions-and-isotopic-composition-in-urban-and-agr|journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Biogeosciences|language=English|volume=116|issue=1|pages=G01013|doi=10.1029/2010JG001494|issn=0148-0227}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2010, Townsend-Small has been at the [[University of Cincinnati]], where she is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Geology and Geography as well as the director of the Environmental Studies Program.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Her current research at [[University of California, Irvine|UCI]] investigates [[Anthropogenic greenhouse gases|anthropogenic]] sources of [[methane]] and [[climate change]] feedbacks to the global [[carbon cycle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=Ramon A.|last2=Zavala-Araiza|first2=Daniel|last3=Lyon|first3=David R.|last4=Allen|first4=David T.|last5=Barkley|first5=Zachary R.|last6=Brandt|first6=Adam R.|last7=Davis|first7=Kenneth J.|last8=Herndon|first8=Scott C.|last9=Townsend-Small|first9=Amy|date=2018-06-21|title=Improved characterization of methane emissions from the U.S. oil and gas supply chain|url=https://www.nist.gov/publications/improved-characterization-methane-emissions-us-oil-and-gas-supply-chain|journal=Science Magazine|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6973">'''Cancer slope factors''' (CSF) are used to estimate the risk of [[cancer]] associated with exposure to a [[carcinogen]]ic or potentially carcinogenic substance. A slope factor is an upper bound, approximating a 95% [[confidence limit]], on the increased cancer risk from a lifetime exposure to an agent by [[ingestion]] or [[inhalation]]. This estimate, usually expressed in units of proportion (of a population) affected per mg of substance/kg [[body weight]]-day, is generally reserved for use in the low-dose region of the [[dose-response relationship]], that is, for exposures corresponding to risks greater than 1 in 100.&lt;ref name="IRIS"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/iris/help_ques.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Slope factors are also referred to as cancer potency factors (PF).

==Toxicity Assessments for Carcinogenic Effects==

For carcinogens, it is commonly assumed that a small number of molecular events may evoke changes in a single cell that can lead to uncontrolled cellular proliferation and eventually to a clinical diagnosis of cancer.  This [[toxicity]] of carcinogens is referred to as being "non-threshold" because there is believed to be essentially no level of exposure that does not pose some probability of producing a carcinogenic response, therefore, there is no dose that can be considered to be risk-free. However, some (non-genotoxic) carcinogens may exhibit a threshold whereby doses lower than the threshold do not invoke a carcinogenic response. 

When evaluating cancer risks of genotoxic carcinogens, theoretically an effect threshold cannot be estimated.  For [[chemical]]s that are carcinogens, a two-part evaluation to quantify risk is often employed in which the substance first is assigned a weight-of-evidence classification, and then a ''slope factor'' is calculated.&lt;ref name ="RAGS"&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/riskassessment/ragsa/pdf/ch7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generating a Slope Factor==

When the chemical is a known or probable human carcinogen, a toxicity value that defines quantitatively the relationship between dose and response (i.e., the slope factor) is calculated.  Because risk at low exposure levels is difficult to measure directly either by animal experiments or by [[Epidemiology|epidemiologic studies]], the development of a slope factor generally entails applying a model to the available ''[[data set]]'' and using the model to extrapolate from the relatively high doses administered to experimental animals (or the exposures noted in epidemiologic studies) to the lower exposure levels expected for human contact in the environment.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

==Data Sets==

High-quality human data (e.g. high quality epidemiological studies) on carcinogens are preferable to animal data. When human data are limited, the most sensitive species is given the greatest emphasis.  Occasionally, in situations where no single study is judged most appropriate, yet several studies collectively support the estimate, the [[geometric mean]] of estimates from all studies may be adopted as the slope.  This practice ensures the inclusion of all relevant data.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

==Weight-of-Evidence Classification for Carcinogens==

Slope factors are typically calculated for potential carcinogens in classes A, B1, and B2.  Quantitative estimation of slope factors for the chemicals in class C proceeds on a case-by-case basis. The slope factor is used in risk assessments to estimate an upper-bound lifetime probability of an individual developing cancer as a result of exposure to a   particular level of a potential carcinogen.  Slope  factors should always be accompanied by the ''weight of-evidence'' classification to indicate the strength of the evidence that the agent is a human carcinogen.&lt;ref name="RAGS" /&gt;

* A = Human carcinogen
* B1 = indicates that limited human data are available.
* B2 = indicates sufficient evidence in animals and inadequate or no evidence in humans.
* C = Possible human carcinogen
* D = Not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity
* E = Evidence of non-carcinogenicity for humans

==Calculation of Cancer Risk==
For each age interval "i", the cancer risk for exposure by a specified pathway is computed as:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/oswer/riskassessment/sghandbook/riskcalcs.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\text{Risk}_i = C \cdot \frac{IR_i \cdot EF_i \cdot ED_i}{BW_i \cdot AT} \cdot SF \cdot ADAF_i
&lt;/math&gt;

Where:
:C = Concentration of the chemical in the contaminated environmental medium (soil or water) to which the person is exposed. The units are mg/kg for soil and mg/L for water.
:IR&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Intake rate of the contaminated environmental medium for age bin "i". The units are kg/day for soil and L/day for water.
:BW&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Body weight of the exposed person for age bin "i".
:EF&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Exposure frequency for age bin "i" (days/year). This describes how often a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of a typical year.
:ED&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; = Exposure duration for age bin "i" (years). This describes how long a person is exposed to the contaminated medium over the course of their lifetime.
:AT = Averaged time, in days. This term specifies the length of time over which the average dose is calculated. For quantifying cancer risk a "lifetime" of 70 years is used (i.e, 70 years times 365 days/year).
:SF = Cancer slope factor (mg/kg-day)&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
:ADAF = Age-dependant adjustment factor for age bin "i" (unitless)

==Risk Specific Dose (RSD)==

The '''Cancer Slope Factor''' is used to derive the Risk Specific Dose (RSD)(mg/kg-day) for direct-acting carcinogenic agents, those that cause chemical changes ([[mutation]]s) in [[DNA]].  It is also the default choice for carcinogens when there are insufficient data to demonstrate that the mode of action of the chemical is nonlinear.  The RSD is often calculated based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; risk) or a one-in-a-hundred-thousand risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; risk) for other-than highly exposed individuals.  The term "extra" in the definition of the RSD refers to a risk from environmental exposure to the chemical of interest above the background risk that is always present.&lt;ref&gt;http://water.epa.gov/learn/training/wacademy/health_page15.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

The formula to calculate the RSD for a chemical based on a one-in-a-million extra risk (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; risk) is:  RSD = 0.000001 / CSF

==Potency Factor==
The CSF is also called a "potency factor" and is used to calculate the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk by multiplying the CSF by the chronic daily intake (CDI).  The CDI is the dose over a lifetime and is expressed in mg/kg-day.&lt;ref&gt;Environmental law, policy, and economics: reclaiming the environmental agenda By Nicholas Askounes Ashford, Charles C. Caldart (Page 87)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Conditional access''' (abbreviated '''CA''') or '''conditional access system''' (abbreviated '''CAS''') is the protection of content by requiring certain criteria to be met before granting access to the content. The term is commonly used in relation to [[digital television]] systems.

==In Digital Video Broadcasting==
Under the [[Digital Video Broadcasting]] (DVB) standard, conditional access system (CAS) standards are defined in the specification documents for DVB-CA (conditional access), [[Common Scrambling Algorithm|DVB-CSA]] (the common [[Scrambler|scrambling]] algorithm) and [[DVB-CI]] (the [[Common Interface]]). These standards define a method by which one can obfuscate a digital-television stream, with access provided only to those with valid decryption [[smart cards|smart-cards]]. The DVB specifications for conditional access are available from the [http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/index.xml#conditional standards page on the DVB website].

This is achieved by a combination of [[scrambler|scrambling]] and [[encryption]]. The data stream is scrambled with a 48-bit secret key, called the ''control word''. Knowing the value of the control word at a given moment is of relatively little value, as under normal conditions, content providers will change the control word several times per minute. The control word is generated automatically in such a way that successive values are not usually predictable; the DVB specification recommends using a physical process for that.

In order for the receiver to unscramble the data stream, it must be permanently informed about the current value of the control word. In practice, it must be informed slightly in advance, so that no viewing interruption occurs. [[Encryption]] is used to protect the control word during transmission to the receiver: the control word is encrypted as an ''entitlement control message'' (ECM). The CA subsystem in the receiver will decrypt the control word only when authorised to do so; that authority is sent to the receiver in the form of an ''entitlement management message'' (EMM). The EMMs are specific to each [[subscriber]], as identified by the smart card in his receiver, or to groups of subscribers, and are issued much less frequently than ECMs, usually at monthly intervals. This being apparently not sufficient to prevent unauthorized viewing, [[Télévision Par Satellite|TPS]] has lowered this interval down to about 12 minutes. This can be different for every provider, [[British Sky Broadcasting|BSkyB]] uses a term of 6 weeks. When [[Nagravision|Nagravision 2]] was hacked, [[Digital+]] started sending a new EMM every three days to make unauthorized viewing more cumbersome.

The contents of ECMs and EMMs are not standardized and as such they depend on the conditional access system being used.

The control word can be transmitted through different ECMs at once. This allows the use of several conditional access systems at the same time, a DVB feature called ''simulcrypt'', which saves bandwidth and encourages multiplex operators to cooperate. [http://www.dvb.org/technology/standards/index.xml#conditional DVB Simulcrypt] is widespread in Europe; some channels, like the [[CNN International]] Europe from the [[Hot Bird]] satellites, can use 7 different CA systems in parallel.
 
The decryption cards are read, and sometimes updated with specific access rights, either through a [[conditional-access module]] (CAM), a [[PC card]]-format card reader meeting DVB-CI standards, or through a built-in [[ISO/IEC 7816]] card reader, such as that in the [[Digibox (Sky Digital)|Sky Digibox]].

Several companies provide competing CA systems; ABV, [[VideoGuard]], Irdeto, [[Nagravision]], [[Conax]], [[Viaccess]], [[Cisco]], [[Mediaguard]] (a.k.a. [[Nagra France|SECA]]) are among the most commonly used CA systems.

Due to the common usage of CA in DVB systems, many tools to aid in or even [[Pirate decryption|directly circumvent]] encryption exist. CAM emulators and multiple-format CAMs exist which can either read several card formats or even directly decrypt a compromised encryption scheme. Most multiple format CAMs and all CAMs that directly decrypt a signal are based on [[reverse engineering]] of the CA systems. A large proportion of the systems currently in use for DVB encryption have been opened to full decryption at some point, including Nagravision, Conax, Viaccess, Mediaguard (v1) as well as the first version of VideoGuard.

==Conditional access in North America==
In Canadian and United States [[Cable television in the United States|cable systems]], the standard for conditional access is provided with [[CableCARD]]s whose specification was developed by the cable company consortium [[CableLabs]].

Cable companies in the US are required by the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to support CableCARDs; standards now exist for two way communication (M-card) but satellite television has its own standards. Next generation approaches in the United States eschew such physical cards and employ schemes using downloadable software for conditional access such as [[Downloadable Conditional Access System|DCAS]].

The main appeal of such approaches is that the [[access control]] may be upgraded dynamically in response to security breaches without requiring expensive exchanges of physical [[conditional-access module]]s. Another appeal is that it may be inexpensively incorporated into non-traditional media display devices such as [[Portable media player|portable media players]].

Avidor-Reiss T, Leroux MR. Curr Biol. 2015 Dec 7;25(23):R1143-50. doi: 10.1016/j.cub.2015.11.001 ([http://0-resolver.ebscohost.com.carlson.utoledo.edu/openurl?sid=Entrez%3aPubMed&amp;id=pmid%3a26654377&amp;site=ftf-live online version)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cytosolic ciliogenesis is divided into three types: Primary cytosolic cilia are formed by exposing the [[axoneme]] of compartmentalized cilium (formed initially by [[compartmentalized ciliogenesis]]) to the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in the sperm of human and other [[mammals]]. Secondary cytosolic cilia are formed in parallels to the formation of the typical compartmentalized cilium. One end of the axoneme is exposed to the cytoplasm as the other end of the axoneme is formed as compartmentalized cilia. This type of cilia is found in [[insects]]. Tertiary cytosolic cilia are axonemes that form directly in the cytoplasm. This type of cilia is found in [[Plasmodium]] (the [[malaria]] parasite).&lt;ref name="sdm" /&gt;

== History ==
The term Cytosolic Ciliogenesis was coined in 2004 as part of a study that identified a large set of ciliogenesis genes &lt;ref&gt;.Avidor-Reiss T, Maer AM, Koundakjian E, Polyanovsky A, Keil T, Subramaniam S, Zuker CS. Decoding cilia function: defining specialized genes required for compartmentalized cilia biogenesis. Cell. 2004 May 14;117(4):527-39. http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(04)00412-X.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.
It was found that a subset of genes that are thought to be essential for compartmentalized cilia are not essential to form the sperm flagellum. Since the axoneme of this flagellum was exposed to the cytoplasm it was named Cytosolic Ciliogenesis &lt;ref&gt; Avidor-Reiss, T., and M.R. Leroux. 2015. Shared and Distinct Mechanisms of Compartmentalized and Cytosolic Ciliogenesis. Curr Biol. 25:R1143-1150. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5857621/ &lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Design–build''' (or '''design/build''', and abbreviated '''D–B''' or '''D/B''' accordingly) is a [[Project delivery method|project delivery system]] used in the construction industry. It is a method to deliver a project in which the design and construction services are contracted by a single entity known as the '''design–builder''' or '''design–build contractor'''. It can be subdivided into '''architect-led design–build''' ('''ALDB''', sometimes known as '''designer-led design–build''') and '''contractor-led design–build'''.

In contrast to "[[design–bid–build]]" (or "design–tender"), design–build relies on a single point of responsibility contract and is used to minimize risks for the project owner and to reduce the delivery schedule by overlapping the design phase and construction phase of a project. "DB with its single point responsibility carries the clearest contractual remedies for the clients because the DB contractor will be responsible for all of the work on the project, regardless of the nature of the fault".&lt;ref&gt;“Construction Contracts: Law and management” by John Murdoch and Will Hughes, published in 2007 by “Taylor &amp; Francis E-library”, fourth edition, United Kingdom {{ISBN|0-203-96574-4}} simultaneously published in USA {{ISBN|978-0-415-39368-3}} and Canada {{ISBN|978-0-415-39369-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional approach for construction projects consists of the appointment of a designer on one side, and the appointment of a contractor on the other side. The design–build procurement route changes the traditional sequence of work. It answers the client's wishes for a single point of responsibility in an attempt to reduce risks and overall costs. It is now commonly used in many countries and forms of contracts are widely available.

Design–build is sometimes compared to the "master builder" approach, one of the oldest forms of construction procedure. Comparing design–build to the traditional method of procurement, the authors of ''Design-build Contracting Handbook'' noted that: “from a historical perspective the so-called traditional approach is actually a very recent concept, only being in use approximately 150 years. In contrast, the design–build concept—also known as the "master builder" concept—has been reported as being in use for over four millennia."&lt;ref&gt;"Design-Build Contracting Handbook", by Robert Frank Cushman &amp; Michael C. Loulakis, published in 2001 by Aspen Law &amp; Business, USA {{ISBN|0-7355-2182-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) takes the position that design–build can be led by a contractor, a designer, a developer or a joint venture, as long as a design–build entity holds a single contract for both design and construction, some architects have suggested that [[architect-led design–build]] is a specific approach to design–build. 

Design-build plays important role in [[pedagogy]], both at universities and in independently organised events such as [[Rural Studio]] or [[ArchiCamp]].

==Design–build contractor==
The "design–builder" is often a [[general contractor]], but in many cases a project is led by a design professional ([[architect]], [[engineer]], [[architectural technologist]] or other professional designers). Some design–build firms employ professionals from both the design and construction sector. Where the design–builder is a general contractor, the [[designers]] are typically retained directly by the contractor. [[Partnership]] or a joint venture between a design firm and a construction firm may be created on a long term basis or for one project only.

Until 1979, the AIA [[American Institute of Architects]]' code of ethics and professional conduct prohibited their members from providing construction services. However today many architects in the United States and elsewhere aspire to provide integrated design and construction services, and one approach towards this goal is design–build. The AIA has acknowledged that design–build is becoming one of the main approaches to construction. In 2003, the AIA endorsed "''The architect's guide to design–build services''",&lt;ref&gt;"The architect's guide to design–build services" By G. William Quatman &amp; Ranjit Dhar, published in 2003 by John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., USA {{ISBN|0-471-21842-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was written to help their members acting as design–build contractors. This publication gives guidance through the different phases of the process: design services, contracts, management, insurances, and finances.

==Contractor-led design–build projects: the architect's role==
On contractor-led design–build projects, management is structured so that the owner works directly with a contractor who, in turn, coordinates subcontractors. Architects contribute to contractor-led design–build projects in one of several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

[[File:CLDB 3models.jpg|thumb|500px|center|alt=Three models of contractor-led design–build | Three models of contractor-led design–build]]

#Architect as employee of contractor: The architect works for the contractor as an in-house employee. The architect still bears professional risk and is likely to have less control than in other contractor-led design–build approaches.
#Architect as a subcontractor: Here, the architect is one of the many subcontractors on the team led by the contractor. The architect bears similar professional risk but still with little control.
#Architect as second party in contractor-led integrated project delivery (IPD): The architect and contractor work together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. The building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. The contractor leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the architect might defer to the contractor. The architect bears the same risk as they do in the traditional approach but has more control in IPD, even if they were to defer to the contractor.

==Architect-led design–build projects==
Architect-led design–build projects are those in which interdisciplinary teams of architects and building trades professionals collaborate in an agile management process, where design strategy and construction expertise are seamlessly integrated, and the architect, as owner-advocate, project-steward and team-leader, ensures high fidelity between project aims and outcomes.  In architect-led design–build projects, the architect works directly with the owner (the client), acts as the designer and builder, coordinating a team of consultants, subcontractors and materials suppliers throughout the project lifecycle.

Architects lead design–build projects in several ways, with varying degrees of responsibility (where "A/E" in each diagram represents the architect/engineer):

[[File:ALDB 3models.jpg|thumb|500px|center|alt=Three models of architect-led design–build | Three models of architect-led design–build]]

#Architect as provider of extended services: Contracted to the owner, the architect extends his or her services beyond the design phase, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors on behalf of the owner. The architect bears similar risk but has more control over the project than in the traditional approach or on contractor-led design–build projects.
#Architect as primary party in architect-led integrated project delivery (IPD): Again, as in working together in a joint venture, both coordinating the subcontractors to get the project built. Again, the building owner has a single contract with this joint venture. This time, the architect leads the joint venture so in supervising the subs, the contractor might defer to the architect. The architect might bear more risk than they do in the traditional approach but risk is shared with the owner and the contractor, as outlined in their agreement. An alternative approach to effectuating this delivery structure is for the architect to contract directly with the owner to design and build the project, and then to subcontract the procurement and construction responsibilities to its allied general contractor, who enters into further subcontracts with the trades.  This is a difference in form, rather than in substance, because the business and legal terms of the agreement between the architect and the general contractor may be the same regardless of whether they are characterized as a joint venture or as a subcontract.  It is the "flip side of the coin" of the contractor-led approach described above in which the general contractor subcontracts the design to the architect.
#Architect as full service leader of design build process: Contracted to the owner, the architect offers full service to the owner, taking responsibility for managing the subcontractors, consultants and vendors, and involving them throughout the project, start to finish, from design through construction. The architect's role shifts during the project, from designer to site supervisor (effectively taking the role of a general contractor), but monitors the project vision, and is able to call upon subcontractors' construction expertise throughout. The architect bears the greatest risk but also has more control over the project than in either the traditional approach, or in the contractor-led and other architect-led design–build projects.

==Contracts==
A single set of integrated contracts combining design and construction responsibilities, rather than two discrete contracts for each, acknowledges the interdependence of the architects' and construction trades' project responsibilities, and reduces the likelihood of disputes.&lt;ref name="Dorwin"&gt;[http://www.fldbia.org/Documents/AIA%20DB%20%20Dorwin%20Thomas%20presentation.pdf ''Advanced Design-Build Strategies for Architects'' by Dorwin A.J. Thomas, DBIA] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321180400/http://www.fldbia.org/Documents/AIA%20DB%20%20Dorwin%20Thomas%20presentation.pdf |date=March 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design–build institutes==
In 1993, the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/|title=Home|work=dbia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; was formed. Its membership is composed of design and construction industry professionals as well as project owners. DBIA promotes the value of design–build project delivery and teaches the effective integration of design and construction services to ensure success for owners and design and construction practitioners. The Design-Build Institute of America is an organization that defines, teaches and promotes best practices in design–build.

The Canadian Design-Build Institute (CDBI) describes itself as "The recognized voice of Design-Build practitioners in Canada, promoting and enhancing the proper utilization of Design-Build method of procurement and contracting"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdbi.org/|title=Canadian Design-Build Institute — Promoting and enhancing the design-build industry – where creativity and construction meet|work=cdbi.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy===
Not all design–build projects are alike.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archrecord.construction.com/resources/conteduc/archives/0511edit-1.asp  ''Hopes and Fears of Design–build'', Nancy Solomon, Architectural Record, November 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, there is a distinction between design–build projects led by contractors and those led by architects. Architect-led Design Build is a form of 'design–build' that, according to the DBIA,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbia.org Design Build Institute of America, or ''DBIA'']&lt;/ref&gt; has been rapidly gaining market share in the United States over the past 15 years. The Design Build Institute of America describes the design–build process as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Taking singular responsibility, the design–build team is accountable for cost, schedule and performance, under a single contract and with reduced administrative paperwork, clients can focus on the project rather than managing disparate contracts. And, by closing warranty gaps, building owners also virtually eliminate litigation claims.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The DBIA's 2005 chart shows the uptake of design–build methods in non-residential design and construction in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ ''What is Design Build?''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511113024/http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |date=May 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Architect-led design–build is sometimes known by the more generic name "designer-led design–build". Although employed primarily by architects, [[architectural technologists]] and other architectural professions, the design–build structure works similarly for interior design projects led by an [[interior designer]] who is not an architect, and also for engineering projects where the design–build team is led by a professional structural, civil, mechanical or other [[engineers]]. In addition, it is common for the design professional who leads the design–build team to create a separate corporation or similar business entity through which the professional performs the construction and other related non-professional services.

Design–build continues to gain ground as a significant trend in design and construction today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rdbmagazine.com/print/Residential-Design-and-Build/Architects-Should-Be-Leading-DesignBuild-Projects/1$4416 ''Architects Should Be Leading Design-build Projects'', by Luis Jauregui Residential Design Build magazine, October 2010]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110208140939/http://www.rdbmagazine.com/print/Residential-Design-and-Build/Architects-Should-Be-Leading-DesignBuild-Projects/1%244416 |date=February 8, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, industry consultants ZweigWhite published "Design-Bid-Build meets the opposition".&lt;ref&gt;The Zweig Letter, ISSN 1068-1310, issue 902&lt;/ref&gt; In it, they suggest that while Design-Bid-Build "still rules", the traditional approach is losing favor as "alternative project delivery methods threaten [the] design-bid-build model." While not referencing the architect-led design–build approach specifically, the article states that D/B already accounts for 27% of projects, according to their 2010 Project Management Survey and goes on to argue that,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The emerging trends in delivery seem to point to a return to the primordial concept of the masterbuilder, as exemplified by D/B and IPD [Integrated Project Delivery].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the DBIA, the design–build approach offers advantages to owners, including:
"One team, one contract, one unified flow of work from initial concept through completion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511113024/http://www.dbia.org/about/designbuild/ |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}{{cite web|url=http://www.westoverconstruction.com/Design_Build.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120822011537/http://www.westoverconstruction.com/Design_Build.html |archivedate=2012-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate on the merits of design–build vs. design–bid–build==
[[File:dbbtimeline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Traditional Design Bid Build|Design-Bid-Build project timeline]]
[[File:aldbtimeline.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Architect-led Design Build Timeline| ALDB project timeline]]

The rise of design–build project delivery has threatened the traditional hierarchies and silos of the design and construction industry. As a result, a debate has emerged over the value of design–build as a method of project delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constructiondigital.com/architectural_design/designbuild-vs-architecture-firms|title=Design/Build VS. Architecture Firms|work=Architectural Design|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611204820/http://www.constructiondigital.com/architectural_design/designbuild-vs-architecture-firms|archivedate=2011-06-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics of the design–build approach claim that design–build limits the clients’ involvement in the design and allege that contractors often make design decisions outside their area of expertise. They also suggest that a designer—rather than a construction professional—is a better advocate for the client or project owner and/or that by representing different perspectives and remaining in their separate spheres, designers and builders ultimately create better buildings.

Proponents of design–build counter that design–build saves time and money for the owner, while providing the opportunity to achieve innovation in the delivered facility. They note that value is added because design-build brings [[value engineering]] into the design process at the onset of a project. Design–build allows the contractor, engineers and specialty trade contractors (subcontractors) to propose best-value solutions for various construction elements before the design is complete. Design–build brings all members of a project team together early in the process to identify and address issues of cost, schedule and constructability. Proponents suggest that as a result, design-build alleviates conflict between architects and contractors and reduces owner risk for design errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.korteco.com/design-build|title=Design-Build: The Complete Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that once design is finalized and construction begins, the greatest opportunity to achieve cost savings has already been lost, and the potential for design errors is greater, leading to change orders that create cost growth and schedule delays. Proponents note that design–build allows owners to avoid being placed directly between the architect/engineer and the contractor. Under design–bid–build, the owner takes on significant risks because of that position. Design–build places the responsibility for design errors and omissions on the design–builder, relieving the owner of major legal and managerial responsibilities. The burden for these costs and associated risks are transferred to the design–build team.

The cost and schedule reduction and decreased litigation associated with design–build project delivery have been demonstrated repeatedly. Researches on ''Selecting Project Delivery Systems''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Victor Sanvido|author2=Mark Konchar|last-author-amp=yes|title=Project Delivery Systems: CM at Risk, Design-Build, Design-Bid-Build|journal=Construction Industry Institute Research Report|date=April 1998|pages=133–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Victor Sanvido and Mark Konchar of Pennsylvania State University found that design–build projects are delivered 33.5% faster than projects that are designed and built under separate contracts (design-bid-build). Sanvido and Konchar also showed that design–build projects are constructed 12% faster* and have a unit cost that is 6.1% lower than design-bid-build projects. Similar cost and time savings were found in a comparison study of design–build, and design-bid-build for the water/wastewater construction industry, a peer-reviewed paper authored by Smith Culp Consulting that will be published in July 2011 by the American Society of Civil Engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/6/prweb8563707.htm|title=New Report Describes Time and Cost Savings From Design Build Project Delivery|date=13 June 2011|work=PRWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt; A benchmarking and claims study by Victor O. Schinnerer, one of the world's largest firms underwriting professional liability and specialty insurance programs, found that, from 1995–2004, only 1.3% of claims against A/E firms were made by design–build contractors. Advantages have been summarized as:

* Efficiency: Typically led by contractors, 'design–build' has evolved as an efficient way to deliver projects primarily where the building project goals are straightforward, either constrained by budget, or the outcome is prescribed by functional requirements (for example, a highway, sports facility, or brewery). Construction industry commentators have described design–build as a high performance 'construction project delivery system', a dynamic approach to making buildings that presents an alternative to the traditional design-bid-build approach.
* Single-source: Design–build is growing because of the advantages of single-source management: Unlike traditional design-bid-build, it allows for the owner to contract with just one party who acts as a single point of contact, is responsible for delivering the project and coordinates the rest of the team.  Depending on the phasing of the project, there may be multiple sequential contracts between the owner and the design–builder.  the owner benefits because if something turns out to be wrong with the project, there is a single entity that is responsible for fixing the problem, rather than a separate designer and constructor each blaming the other.

===Advantages for less-presciptive projects===
Architect-led design–build is suited primarily to less prescriptive architectural projects (private residences, non-profit institutions, museums), for the efficiencies it yields and the sophisticated design interpretation it affords, particularly:
* Where the primary project goals are design-driven or visionary rather than prescribed by budgetary constraint or functional requirements
* Where the project is specifically "Capital A"-artistically/creatively driven, in a way that traditionally yields the highest level of cost overruns.
* Where the efficiencies of design–build approach and an architect's interpretive skill are equally important

These less prescriptive projects need not be stuck with the "broken buildings and busted budgets"&lt;ref&gt;LePatner, Barry.  "Broken Buildings, Busted Budgets: How to Fix America's Trillion-Dollar Construction Industry". The University of Chicago Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; described by Barry Lepatner. Rather, the less prescriptive the project, the more the client needs an architect to steward an emergent design from vision to completion. So it follows that for the broadest range of building projects, the rigors of architect-led design–build is compelling and preferable where design is of paramount importance to the client.

===Recursive knowledge===
The process and the knowledge it produces is recursive: Since subcontractors are engaged early and often in an architect-led design build project, to assess efficiencies, opportunity costs, payback rates and quality options. Their input informs overall design decisions from the outset. Cost-benefit is also a constant consideration that informs design decisions from the outset. Building performance is measured early too, so that trade offs between budget, schedule, functionality and usability can inform specification and continuous refinement of the design.

Architects engaged in this dynamic process understand and keep up to date with the potential of contemporary technology&lt;ref&gt;''An Enthusiastic Sceptic'' by Nat Oppenheimer, Architectural Design (2009) Volume: 79, Issue: 2, Pages: 100–105, an assessment of Building Information Management (BIM) software&lt;/ref&gt; and materials available to building professionals, and translate what they learn into their design work. This knowledge is fed back, not just to the specific project but can be shared to other project teams, throughout a studio, or more broadly to the profession, and can become an active source of insight in and of itself.

==Growth of design–build method==
A 2011 study analyzing the design–build project delivery method in the United States shows design–build was used on about 40 percent of non-residential construction projects in 2010, a ten percent increase since 2005. The study was commissioned by the Design-Build Institute of America (DBIA) and was completed by RSMeans Reed Construction Data Market Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dbia.org/resource-center/Pages/Report-by-RCD-RSMeans-Market-Intelligence.aspx|title=Report by Reed Construction Data/RSMeans Market Intelligence|work=dbia.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study from the US Department of Transportation claims that: "Design-build delivery has been steadily increasing in the U.S. public building sector for more than 10 years, but it is still termed experimental in transportation. To date, under Special Experimental Project 14 (SEP-14) the FHWA has approved the use of design–build in more than 150 projects, representing just over half of the States. The European countries visited have used design–build delivery for a longer time than the United States and provided the scan team with many valuable insights. The primary lessons learned on this scan tour relate to the types of projects utilizing design–build, the use of best-value selection, percentage of design in the solicitation, design and construction administration, third-party risks, the use of warranties, and the addition of maintenance and operation to design–build contracts."&lt;ref&gt;US Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration, International Programs, [http://international.fhwa.dot.gov/contractadmin/04.cfm Chapter 4 – Contract Administration: Technology and Practice in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms of design–build==
During the design–build procedure, the contractor is deciding on design issues as well as issues related to cost, profits and time exigencies. Whilst the traditional method of construction procurement dissociates the designers from the contractors’ interests, design–build does not. On these grounds it is considered that the design–build procedure is poorly adapted to projects that require complex designs for technical, programmatic or aesthetic purposes.
If the designer/architect is 'kept' by the construction company, they probably will never push the envelope as to what might be possible.
A notable design–build project that received significant criticism, not only for excessive cost but for environmental issues, was the [[Belmont Learning Center]].  The scandal involved alleged contaminated soil that caused significant delays and massive cost overruns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/SCANDAL+FIGURES+SAY+THEY+FOLLOWED+LAUSD+ORDERS-a083613230] Belmont scandal&lt;/ref&gt;  In Los Angeles, District Attorney Steve Cooley, who investigated the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]]’s Belmont project, produced a final investigative report, released March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://da.lacounty.gov/pdf/BLC_Final_Report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527094735/http://da.lacounty.gov/pdf/BLC_Final_Report.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 |df= }} Los Angeles DA, Steve Cooley final Investigate report on Belmont&lt;/ref&gt;  This report concluded that the design–build process caused a number of issues relating to the Belmont scandal:

* Design–build does not make use of competitive bidding where prospective builders bid on the same design.
* Criteria to select contractor are subjective and difficult to evaluate and to justify later.
* The design and price selected arouses public suspicion, true or not.
* This can lead to loss of public confidence.
* The design brief is subject to different interpretations from both the client and contractor, creating a conflict of interest.

It concluded the “design–build” approach and “mixed-use concept” together caused controversy, uncertainty, and complexity of the Belmont project which helped increase the potential for project failure. While the Belmont investigation cleared the [[Los Angeles Unified School District]] of any criminal wrongdoing, the task force recommends strict oversight, including written protocols, a vigorous Office of the Inspector General, and other recommendations if it decides to continue to use the design–build approach. During the period in question, the ex-Superintendent of LAUSD, [[Ramon C. Cortines]], working with the LAUSD Board of Education, whose president is Monica Garcia, actively tried to cut the Office of Inspector General by 75% (compromising on 25%) and subsequently removed the Inspector General Jerry Thornton after he produced critical audits that showed misuse of construction funds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.com/search/ci_12615104?IADID=Search-www.dailynews.com-www.dailynews.com] Daily News – LAUSD watchdog office to be cut by 25%&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued that architect-led design–build still does:&lt;ref name="Dorwin"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://designbuild.construction.com/features/archive/2005/0506_feature2.asp ''AIA Teaching Architects To Lead Design-Build Teams'' by Tom Nicholson, Design and Construction, May/June 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schiffhardin.com/design-build/designer-led.html "Designer-led Design-Build" by Mark Friedlander, Schiff Hardin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101028015012/http://www.schiffhardin.com/design-build/designer-led.html |date=October 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Typical project management issues (establishing liability, writing contracts, scoping estimates and schedule) or
* Variation across different states' licensing laws or
* Conflict of interest and ethical issues

It also imposes:
* Greater business and financial risks associated with architect taking on general contractor responsibilities
* Changes to the way architects do business, so they
** Establish a construction company as a separate corporation that signs a separate construction contract, so they are able to insure and simplify liability insurance coverage
** Either they have, or are able to acquire, the skills of a design–builder
** Recognize the parties' different incentives
** Modify how they prepare Contract Documents, relying more on performance specifications than they do currently, to facilitate substitutions for the benefit of the constructor.

The notion of "policy sciences" may have different connotations. According to [[Harold Lasswell|Harold Laswell]] (1971), "policy sciences are concerned with the knowledge of and in the decision processes of the public and civic order".&lt;ref&gt;Laswell, H.D. (1971). A Preview of Policy Sciences. American Elsevier.  Accessed through http://www.policysciences.org/classics/preview.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Knowledge of decision processes points to the empirical and scientific understanding of the how policies are made and executed.  Empirical knowledge pertains to those generated through scientific inquiry ad observation as applied to decision processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.policysciences.org/policysciences.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-11-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111103911/http://www.policysciences.org/policysciences.php |archivedate=2014-11-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy sciences provide an integrated and comprehensive approach for addressing issues and problems at all levels in ways that help to clarify and secure the common interest. Helping people make better decisions is the central objective of the policy sciences, and the fundamental goal is to foster a commonwealth of human dignity for all. Alexander G. Flor,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.academia.edu/578845/Development_Communication_and_the_Policy_Sciences|title = Journal of Development Communication|last = |first = |date = 1991|journal = |accessdate = |doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ph.D., one of the esteemed development communicators in the [[Philippines]] and also a full professor at the [[University of the Philippines Open University]], points out that "policy scientists or policy analysts are involved not only in the scientific design, formulation, analysis and evaluation of policies. They are also concerned with the study of the policy making process itself". Flor advocates that "if indeed communication and information are to be efficiently and effectively utilized in the development process, then policies are needed to direct their use for the achievement of the highest social good".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The term "policy sciences" is in plural form to emphasize its interdisciplinary nature.&lt;ref&gt;Allen (1978), cited in Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. Journal of Development Communication. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  It recognizes the multiplicity of factors affecting certain problems and multi-dimensions of certain phenomenon that is subject to decision processes.&lt;ref&gt;Flor, Alexander (1991). Development Communication and the Policy Sciences. Journal of Development Communication. Kuala Lumpur: Asian Institute of Development Communication.&lt;/ref&gt;  As such, the emphasis of policy sciences is on applying scientific or empirical evidences in understanding problems so that more realistic, responsive and effective interventions are identified and implemented.  Since a problem is multi-dimensional, various scientific disciplines are needed to form a comprehensive analysis of a certain phenomenon.

==Policy analysis styles==
Dutch policy science experts Mayers, van Daalen and Bots&lt;ref name=Mayers&gt;{{Cite journal|url =http://www.ced.cl/ced/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/mayer-et-al_2004.pdf.|title =International Journal of Technology Policy and Management|last =|first =|date =2004|journal =|accessdate =|doi =|pmid =}}{{dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed policy analysis styles which can be helpful to communication policy analysts and organizational policy analysts, among others. These styles are as follow:

# Rational &lt;br/&gt; This style is "shaped to a large degree by assumptions about knowledge and reality, and by a relatively large distance between the object and subject of study."
# Argumentative &lt;br/&gt; Assumes that "when analyzing policy, it is important to devote attention to aspects related to the language game that takes place around a policy problem or issue".
# Client advice &lt;br/&gt; "Besides knowledge and insights gained through research, policy analysis is largely a question of politico-strategic insight and skills including client-analyst communication."
# Participatory &lt;br/&gt; Assumed that "not all sections of the population have ready access to policy systems; researchers, economic elites, institutionalized non-governmental organizations and politicians dominate policy discussions and decisions about major social issues."
# Process &lt;br/&gt; This is based on the assumption that "substantive aspects of a policy problem are, in fact, coordinate or perhaps even subordinate to the procedural aspects of a policy problem. The analyst or process manager creates 'loose coupling' of procedural aspects and substantive aspects of a problem."
# Interactive &lt;br/&gt;This style assumes that "individuals – experts, analysts, clients, stakeholders and target groups – have or may have differing views of the 'same' policy problem. An insight relevant to policy can be obtained by bringing about a confrontation and interaction of different views."

The styles mentioned above are based on underlying values and orientations, which determine in what way a policy analyst or others will view the quality of the policy analysis study and the criteria that will be applied to examine it. According to Mayer et al.&lt;ref name=Mayers/&gt; these criteria can be made explicit by addressing the following questions:

* Rational style. What is good knowledge?
* Argumentative style. What is good for the debate?
* Client advice style. What is good for the client/problem owner?
* Participatory style. What is good for democratic society?
* Process style. What is good for the process?
* Interactive style. What is good for mutual understanding?

==Theoretical approaches in development communication==

Today, development communication has shifted from modernization and dependency theories to more normative and holistic approaches. The modernization paradigm, which became dominant in the 1945 to 1965, supported the transfer of technology and the socio-political culture of the developed societies to the traditional societies. Development then was defined as economic growth. The main idea of the modernization perspective is the idea of evolution where development is conceived as directional and cumulative, predetermined and irreversible, progressive, and immanent with reference to the nation state. Here, the developed western societies seem to be the ultimate goals which the less developed societies strive to reach. These two sectors, the traditional and the modern, were regarded as two stages of development and in time the differences between them were to disappear because of the natural inclination towards equilibrium. The problem was to remove the barriers, which were only to be found in the traditional society. These barriers can be removed through at least five mechanisms:

# demonstration, whereby the developing world tries to catch up with the more developed by adopting more advanced methods and techniques; 
# fusion, which is the combination and integration of distinct modern methods; 
# compression, whereby the developing countries attempt to accomplish the task of development in less time than it took the developed world; 
# prevention that is, by learning from the 'errors' made by the developed countries; and 
# adaptation of modern practices to the local environment and culture.

Accordingly, the means of modernization were the massive transfer of capital, ideology, technology, and know-how. The measures of progress were G.N.P., literacy, industrial base, urbanization, and the like, all quantifiable criteria.

Communication theories such as the diffusion of innovations, the two-step-flow, or the 'extension' approaches are congruent with the modernization theory. According to Everett Rogers, one of the leading proponents of the diffusion theory, this perspective implies that the role of communication was (1) to transfer technological innovations from development agencies to their clients, and (2) to create an appetite for change through raising a climate for modernization' among the members of the public (Rogers, 1986).

===Diffusion model===

The 1950s was the decade of the communication model. One of the earliest and most influential of these came not from the social sciences or humanities, but from information engineering. Shannon and Weaver's linear source-transmitter-channel-receiver-destination model eclipsed the earlier, more organic, psychological and sociological approaches. Lasswell, Hofland, Newcomb, Schramm, Westley and Mclean, Berlo, and others each devised a model of communication as they conceived it. This profusion of communication models may be attributed to three reasons. Firstly, because they identified communication basically as the transfer of information, they were amenable to empirical methodology, thus establishing the basis for communication as a distinct and legitimate science. Secondly, theorists focused on the efficiency, or effects, of communication, thereby holding vast promise for manipulation or control of message receivers by vested interests, or the sources. Finally, the communication models fit neatly into the nature and mechanics of mass or mediated communication, an emergent and powerful force at that time. Therefore, in these years, the discipline of communication was largely, and most importantly, its effects. The hypodermic needle effects of media were to be a quick and efficient answer to a myriad of social ills.

Building primarily on sociological research in agrarian societies, Everett Rogers (1973) stressed the adoption and diffusion processes of cultural innovation. Modernization is here conceived as a process of diffusion whereby individuals move from a traditional way of life to a more complex, more technically developed and more rapidly changing way of life. This approach is therefore concerned with the process of diffusion and adoption of innovations in a more systematic and planned way. He distinguishes between five phases in the diffusion process: awareness, interest, evaluation, trial and adoption. The role of the mass media is concentrated on the first stage of the process, whereas personal sources are most important at the evaluation stage in the adoption process (Rogers, 1962). In a second edition of his work (Rogers,1973), there are only four crucial steps left in the process of diffusion and adoption: (a) the knowledge of the innovation itself (information), (b) the communication of the innovation (persuasion), (c) the decision to adopt or reject the innovation (adoption or rejection), and (d) the confirmation of the innovation by the individual.

Three more approaches contributed to the success of this diffusion model: that is, a psycho-sociological, institutional and technological interpretation of communication for modernization. The psycho-sociological or behavioristic perspective on communication and modernization is particularly concerned with the individual value and attitude change. Rokeach (1966) defined attitude as a relatively enduring organization of beliefs about an object or situation predisposing one to respond in some preferential manner. Attitude change would then be "a change in predisposition, the change being either a change in the organization or structure of beliefs, or a change in the content of one or more of the beliefs entering into the attitude organization" (Rokeach, 1966; cited in Servaes, 2002). Central in the view of Daniel Lerner (1958), one of the main representatives of this communication for modernization paradigm, is the concept of 'empathy'—the capacity to see oneself in the other fellow's situation. The major hypothesis is that high empathy is predominantly the personal style in modern society, which is distinctively industrial, urban, literate and participant.

Wilbur Schramm (1964), building on Lerner's idea, took a closer look on the perceived connection between mass communication and modernizing practices and institutions. The modern communication media supplement and complement the mobility multipliers—the oral channels of a traditional society. Their development runs parallel to the development of other institutions of modern society, such as schools and industry, and is closely related to some of the indices of general social and economic growth, such as literacy, per capita income, and urbanization. So he claimed that a developing country should give special attention to combining mass media with interpersonal communication (Schramm, 1964; cited in Servaes, 2002).

===Participatory model===

The participatory model incorporates the concepts in the emerging framework of multiplicity. It stresses the importance of cultural identity of local communities and of democratization and participation at all levels—international, national, local and individual. It points to a strategy, not merely inclusive of, but largely emanating from, the traditional receivers. Paulo Freire (1983; cited in Servaes, 2002) refers to this as the right of all people to individually and collectively speak their word. Consequently, no one can say a true word alone—nor can he say it for another, in a prescriptive act which robs others of their words. In order to share information, knowledge, trust, and commitment a right attitude in development projects participation is very important in any decision making process for development. This entails a new attitude for overcoming stereotyped thinking and to promote more understanding of diversity and plurality, with full respect for the dignity and equality of peoples living in different conditions and acting in different ways. (International Commission for the Study of Communication Problems, 1980; cited in Servaes, 2002) This model stresses reciprocal collaboration throughout all levels of participation. Listening to what the others say, respecting the counterpart's attitude, and having mutual trust are needed.

Participation involves the more equitable sharing of both political and economic power, which often decreases the advantage of certain groups. Structural change involves the redistribution of power. In mass communication areas, many communication experts agree that structural change should occur first in order to establish participatory communication policies. In fact, Mowlana and Wilson (1987) made this clear by stating that "Communications policies are basically derivatives of the political, cultural and economic conditions and institutions under which they operate. They tend to legitimize the existing power relations in society, and therefore, they cannot be substantially changed unless there are fundamental structural changes in society that can alter these power relationships themselves".

Since dialogue and face-to-face interaction is inherent in participation, the development communicator usually spend more time in the field as rapport and trust take time to develop. This is the reason why continued contact, meeting commitments, keeping promises, and follows up between visits are important. Development of social trust precedes task trust. Both parties will need patience. It is important to note that treating people the way we would like to be treated, we learn to work as a team, and this brings about rural commitment and motivation too. Further, honesty, trust, and commitment from the higher ups bring honesty, trust, and commitment for the grass-roots as well bringing about true participation. And true participation brings about appropriate policies and planning for developing a country within its cultural and environmental framework. Consequently, the perspective on communication also changes. It is more concerned with process and context, that is, on the exchange of meanings, and on the importance of this process, namely, the social relational patterns and social institutions that are the result of and are determined by the process. With this shift in focus, one is no longer attempting to create a need for the information one is disseminating, but one is rather disseminating information for which there is a need. Experts and development workers rather respond than dictate, they choose what is relevant to the context in which they are working. The emphasis is on information exchange rather than on the persuasion in the diffusion model.

==Two major approaches to participatory communication==
There are two major approaches to participatory communication. The first is the dialogical pedagogy of Paulo Freire, and the second involves the ideas of access, participation and self-management articulated in the Unesco debates of the 1970s. Every communication project which calls itself participatory accepts these principles of democratic communication.

The Freirian argument works by a dual theoretical strategy. It is argued that subjugated peoples must be treated as fully human subjects in any political process. This implies dialogical communication. Although inspired to some extent by Sartre's existentialism—a respect for the autonomous personhood of each human being—the more important source is a theology that demands respect for otherness—in this case that of another human being. The second strategy is a moment of utopian hope derived from the early Marx that the human species has a destiny which is more than life as a fulfillment of material needs. Also from Marx is an insistence on collective solutions. Individual opportunity, Freire stresses, is no solution to general situations of poverty and cultural subjugation.

The second discourse about participatory communication is the Unesco language about self-management, access and participation from the 1977 meeting in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. The final report of that meeting defines the terms in the following way: Access refers to the use of media for public service. It may be defined in terms of the opportunities available to the public to choose varied and relevant programs and to have a means of feedback to transmit its reactions and demands to production organizations.

Participation implies a higher level of public involvement in communication systems. It includes the involvement of the public in the production process, and also in the management and planning of communication systems. It may be no more than representation and consultation of the public in decision-making. On the other hand, self-management is the most advanced form of participation. In this case, the public exercises the power of decision-making within communication enterprises and is also fully involved in the formulation of communication policies and plans. These ideas are important and widely accepted as a normative theory of alternative communication: it must involve access and participation. However, one should note some differences from Freire. The Unesco discourse includes the idea of a gradual progression. Some amount of access may be allowed, but self-management may be postponed until sometime in the future. The Unesco discourse talks in neutral terms about "the public". Freire talked about the oppressed. Finally, the Unesco discourse puts the main focus on the institution. Participatory radio means a radio station that is self-managed by those participating in it.

[[Image:Ecotypes of Physcomitrella patens.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Four different [[ecotypes]] of ''[[Physcomitrella patens]]'', stored at the [[International Moss Stock Center]]]]

In [[evolutionary ecology]], an '''ecotype''',&lt;ref group=note&gt;Greek: ''οίκος'' = home and ''τύπος'' = type, coined by [[Göte Turesson]] in 1922&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes called '''ecospecies''', describes a genetically distinct geographic variety, [[Population biology|population]] or [[Race (biology)|race]] within a [[species]], which is genotypically [[Adaptation|adapted]] to specific environmental conditions.

Typically, though ecotypes exhibit [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences (such as in [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]] or [[physiology]]) stemming from environmental heterogeneity, they are capable of interbreeding with other geographically adjacent ecotypes without loss of fertility or vigor.

(2006), p.5,6,7,8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="G."&gt;{{cite book | last =Turesson | first =Turesson G. | title =The genotypical response of the plant species to the habitat | publisher =Hereditas 3 | year =1922 | pages =211–350 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Molles"&gt;{{cite book | last =Molles | first =Manuel C., Jr. | title =Ecology: Concepts and Applications | publisher =The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.| edition = 3rd | year =2005 | location =New York | pages =201 | isbn = 978-0-07-243969-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ee"&gt;''Environmental Encyclopedia'' by Bortman, Brimblecombe, Mary Ann Cunningham, William P.

==Definition==
An ecotype is a variant in which the [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences are too few or too subtle to warrant being classified as a subspecies. These can occur in the same geographic region where distinct habitats such as meadow, forest, swamp, and sand dunes provide ecological niches. Where similar ecological conditions occur in widely separated places it is possible for a similar ecotype to occur. This is different than a subspecies, which may exist across a number of different habitats. In animals, ecotypes can be regarded as micro-subspecies that owe their differing characteristics to the effects of a very local environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ernst Mayr|title=Systematics and the Origin of Species, from the Viewpoint of a Zoologist|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|chapter=VIII-Nongeographic speciation|pages=194–195|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=mAIjnLp6r_MC&amp;pg=PA194|isbn=9780674862500}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, ecotypes have no [[taxonomic rank]].

==Terminology==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
Ecotypes are closely related to [[Polymorphism (biology)|morphs]]. In the context of [[evolutionary biology]], [[Polymorphism (biology)|genetic polymorphism]] is the occurrence in the equilibrium of two or more distinctly different phenotypes within a population of a species, in other words, the occurrence of more than one '''form''' or '''morph'''. The frequency of these discontinuous forms (even that of the rarest) is too high to be explained by [[mutation]]. In order to be classified as such, morphs must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a [[panmictic]] population (whose all members can potentially interbreed). Polymorphism is actively and steadily maintained in populations of species by natural selection (most famously [[sexual dimorphism]] in humans) in contrast to ''transient polymorphisms'' where conditions in a habitat change in such a way that a "form" is being replaced completely by another.

In fact, Begon, Townsend, and Harper assert that

{{Cquote|''There is not always clear distinction between local ecotypes and genetic polymorphisms.''}}

The notions "form" and "ecotype" may appear to correspond to a static phenomenon, however; this is not always the case. Evolution occurs continuously both in time and space, so that two ecotypes or forms may qualify as distinct species in only a few generations. Begon, Townsend, and Harper use an illuminating analogy on this:

{{Cquote|''… the origin of a species, whether [[Allopatric speciation|allopatric]] or [[Sympatric speciation|sympatric]], is a process, not an event. For the formation of a new species, like the boiling of an egg, there is some freedom to argue about when it is completed.''}}

Thus ecotypes and morphs can be thought of as precursory steps of potential [[speciation]].

==Range and distribution==
Experiments indicate that sometimes ecotypes manifest only when separated by great spatial distances (of the order of 1,000&amp;nbsp;km). This is due to [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] whereby different but adjacent varieties of the same species (or generally of the same [[taxonomic rank]]) interbreed, thus overcoming local selection. However other studies reveal that the opposite may happen, i.e., ecotypes revealing at very small scales (of the order of 10 m), within populations, and despite hybridization.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

In ecotypes, it is common for continuous, gradual geographic variation to impose analogous phenotypic and genetic variation.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt; This situation is called [[Cline (biology)|cline]]. A well-known example of a cline is the skin color gradation in indigenous human populations worldwide, which is related to latitude and amounts of sunlight.&lt;ref&gt;"Race".  (2009). ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. Ultimate Reference Suite. Chicago: Encyclopædia Britannica.&lt;/ref&gt; But often the distribution of ecotypes is [[Bimodal distribution|bimodal]] or multimodal. This means that ecotypes may display two or more distinct and discontinuous phenotypes even within the same population. Such phenomenon may lead to [[speciation]] and can occur if conditions in a local environment change dramatically through space or time.&lt;ref name="BTH" /&gt;

Endogeic earthworms live in and feed on the soil, making horizontal burrows through the soil to move around and to feed and they will reuse these burrows to a certain extent. Anecic earthworms make permanent vertical burrows in soil, feeding on leaves on the soil surface that they drag into their burrows.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.earthwormsoc.org.uk/earthworm-information/earthworm-information-page-2 Earthworm ecotypes], information from the Earthworm Society of Britain about the different ecotypes of British earthworms.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Ethiopic Collectio Monastica''''' is a book that includes some original sayings of the [[Desert Fathers]], and which is textually independent of the more well known ''[[Apophthegmata Patrum]]'' (''Sayings of the Desert Fathers''). It was first published by Victor Arras in 1963, based on two separate manuscripts that were likely based on Greek or Coptic sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Arras|first=Victor|title=Collectio monastica: Ethiopic text|year=1963|publisher=Secrétariat du CorpusSCO|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Collectio_monastica.html?id=D_A2cgAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harmless2000"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Harmless, William  |year=2000 |title=Remembering Poemen Remembering: The Desert Fathers and the Spirituality of Memory |journal=Church History |publisher=American Society of Church History |volume=15 |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-66380509.html}}&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The collection consists of sixty-eight chapter of widely different lengths. Included in the book are collections of Desert Father sayings, most of which have no parallel in the ''Apophthegmata Patrum''. The original work appears to have been written by a 5th-century monk who either lived with the Desert Fathers at [[Scetis]], or knew the monks who lived there. He also appears to have known [[Abba Poemen]], because of several unique stories and sayings attributed to him.&lt;ref name="Harmless2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Harmless, William |title=Desert Christians: an introduction to the literature of early monasticism |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=Appendix 8.5|location=Oxford [Oxfordshire] |year=2004|isbn=0-19-516222-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WIM0pWejvBgC&amp;pg=PT504}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Faculty of Agricultural Science and Food in Skopje''' ({{lang-mk|Факултет за земјоделски хауки и храна“ - Скопје|translit=Fakultet za Zemjodelski Nauki i Hrana}}) is a part of [[Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje]]. The faculty is located in the eastern part of the city Skopje on campus with other departments of biolocical and biotechnological science:Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, University Hospital for Veterinary Medicine, Veterinary Institute, Institute of Agriculture and Faculty of Forestry. Campus is 2&amp;nbsp;km away from the Rector of SS. Cyril and Methodius, and within the campus is located dormitory Stiv Naumov ". The faculty is equipped with a net usable building area of 7465m2, which houses six amphitheaters, 26 lecture, 28 laboratories, 143 offices, library and reading room with an area of 270 m2 and a student café with an area of 180m2.
The Dean from 2009 is Prof.Dr. [[Dragi Dimitrievski]] Ph.D.

==History and profile==

Faculty of Agricultural Science and Food was established in autumn 1947 under the name Faculty of Agriculture, as a separate department of agricultural and forestry faculty, only a year later the foundation of the Faculty of Philosophy. With the establishment of Agricultural and Forestry Faculty, Faculty of Medicine and has founded the Faculty of Philosophy, have provided conditions for the formation of SS. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje.

Agro-forestry faculty, by the establishment and commencement of work, permanently organized and improved as a complete teaching and research institution. So far the work and development, passing through several organizational and developmental stages. The changes and transformations, development and operation due to the need for harmonization of the educational process, scientific research, application of their own and foreign scientific knowledge in agriculture, which is affiliated with the political and socio-economic relations in the social order.

In 1975, agricultural-forestry faculty are divided into two independent faculties: Agriculture and Forestry, as a separate business organizations. This independence comes as a result achieved a high degree of development in all activities of the previous two sections, agriculture and forestry.

From 1977 to 1989, Faculty of Agriculture operates as a working organization which were integrated into the Faculty of Agriculture, Agricultural Institute, Institute of Animal Science, Institute of Veterinary,Veterinary Hospital, Institute for fruit growing, viticulture and the Institute for the college farm Trubarevo.

As a result of the complicated organizational structure, from the beginning of 1990, Faculty of Agriculture working as an independent organization working with three core activities: education, scientific research and applied.In the period from 1992 to 1994 within the Faculty of Agriculture, as a special direction, operated and veterinary direction, which further established the independent Faculty of Veterinary Medicine.

In the same 2001, the Faculty be included among the first four faculties in Ss. Cyril and Methodius, who introduced European Credit Transfer System-[[EKTS]] in the teaching process.

Today the faculty have the following study programs:
* Agro-Economics 
* Animal Biotechnology
* Processing of Animal Products
* Processing of Plant Products
* Quality and Food Safety
* Eco-Agriculture
* Fito-medicine-Plant Protection  
* Viticulture  
* Horticulture
* Production and Processing of Tobacco

==Organization==
These are the [[institutes]] and departments in which the faculty is divided into:

* [[Institute of Animal Biotechnology]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12148">In [[theoretical physics]] and [[applied mathematics]], a '''field equation''' is a [[partial differential equation]] which determines the dynamics of a [[physical field]], specifically the time evolution and spatial distribution of the field. The solutions to the equation are mathematical functions which correspond directly to the field, as functions of time and space. Since the field equation is a partial differential equation, there are families of solutions which represent a variety of physical possibilities. Usually, there is not just a single equation, but a set of coupled equations which must be solved simultaneously. Field equations are not [[ordinary differential equation]]s since a field depends on space and time, which requires at least two variables.

Whereas the "[[wave equation]]", the "[[diffusion equation]]", and the "[[continuity equation]]" all have standard forms (and various special cases or generalizations), there is no single, special equation referred to as "the field equation".

The topic broadly splits into equations of [[classical field theory]] and [[quantum field theory]]. Classical field equations describe many physical properties like temperature of a substance, velocity of a fluid, stresses in an elastic material, electric and magnetic fields from a current, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fetter|first1=A.

==Generalities==

===Origin===

Usually, field equations are postulated (like the [[Einstein field equations]] and the [[Schrödinger equation]], which underlies all quantum field equations) or obtained from the results of experiments (like [[Maxwell's equations]]). The extent of their validity is their extent to correctly predict and agree with experimental results.

From a theoretical viewpoint, field equations can be formulated in the frameworks of [[Lagrangian field theory]], [[Hamiltonian field theory]], and field theoretic formulations of the [[principle of stationary action]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Goldstein |first1=Herbert |authorlink1=Herbert Goldstein | title=Classical Mechanics |edition=2nd |year=1980|isbn= 0201029189|publisher=Addison Wesley |chapter=Chapter 12: Continuous Systems and Fields|location=San Francisco, CA |pages=548, 562}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given a suitable Lagrangian or Hamiltonian density, a function of the fields in a given system, as well as their derivatives, the principle of stationary action will obtain the field equation.

===Symmetry===

In both classical and quantum theories, field equations will satisfy the symmetry of the background physical theory. Most of the time [[Galilean symmetry]] is enough, for speeds (of propagating fields) much less than light. When particles and fields propagate at speeds close to light, [[Lorentz symmetry]] is one of the most common settings because the equation and its solutions are then consistent with special relativity.

Another symmetry arises from [[gauge freedom]], which is intrinsic to the field equations. Fields which correspond to interactions may be [[gauge field]]s, which means they can be derived from a potential, and certain values of potentials correspond to the same value of the field.

===Classification===

Field equations can be classified in many ways: classical or quantum, nonrelativistsic or relativistic, according to the [[spin (physics)|spin]] or [[mass]] of the field, and the number of components the field has and how they change under coordinate transformations (e.g. [[scalar field]]s, [[vector field]]s, [[tensor field]]s, [[spinor field]]s, [[Twistor theory|twistor field]]s etc.). They can also inherit the classification of differential equations, as [[Linear partial differential equation|linear]] or [[Nonlinear partial differential equation|nonlinear]], the order of the highest derivative, or even as [[fractional differential equation]]s. Gauge fields may be classified as in [[group theory]], as [[abelian group|abelian]] or nonabelian.

=== Waves ===

Field equations underlie wave equations, because periodically changing fields generate waves. Wave equations can be thought of as field equations, in the sense they can often be derived from field equations. Alternatively, given suitable Lagrangian or Hamiltonian densities and using the principle of stationary action, the wave equations can be obtained also.

For example, Maxwell's equations can be used to derive [[inhomogeneous electromagnetic wave equation]]s, and from the Einstein field equations one can derive equations for [[gravitational wave]]s.

=== Supplementary equations to field equations ===

Not every partial differential equation (PDE) in physics is automatically called a "field equation", even if fields are involved. They are extra equations to provide additional constraints for a given physical system.

"[[Continuity equation]]s" and "[[diffusion equation]]s" describe [[transport phenomena]], even though they may involve fields which influence the transport processes.

If a "[[constitutive equation]]" takes the form of a PDE and involves fields, it is not usually called a field equation because it does not govern the dynamical behaviour of the fields. They relate one field to another, in a given material. Constitutive equations are used along with field equations when the effects of matter need to be taken into account.

==Classical field equation==

{{main|classical mechanics|classical field theory}}

Classical field equations arise in [[continuum mechanics]] (including [[elastodynamics]] and [[fluid mechanics]]), [[heat transfer]], [[electromagnetism]], and [[gravitation]].

Fundamental classical field equations include

*[[Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation]] for nonrelativistic gravitation.
*[[Einstein field equations]] for [[General Relativity|relativistic gravitation]]
*[[Maxwell's equations]] for electromagnetism.

Important equations derived from fundamental laws include:

*[[Navier–Stokes equations]] for fluid flow.

As part of real-life [[mathematical modelling]] processes, classical field equations are accompanied by other [[equations of motion]], [[equations of state]], [[constitutive equation]]s, and continuity equations.

==Quantum field equation==
{{main|quantum mechanics|quantum field theory}}

In quantum field theory, particles are described by quantum fields which satisfy the [[Schrödinger equation]]. They are also [[creation and annihilation operators]] which satisfy [[commutation relation]]s and are subject to the [[spin–statistics theorem]].

Particular cases of [[relativistic quantum field equations]] include&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=1-139-50432-0|first=T|last=Ohlsson|title=Relativistic Quantum Physics: From Advanced Quantum Mechanics to Introductory Quantum Field Theory|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|pages=23, 42, 44|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRavtAW5EFcC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=pauli-lubanski+pseudovector#v=onepage&amp;q=pauli-lubanski%20pseudovector&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*the [[Klein–Gordon equation]] for spin-0 particles
*the [[Dirac equation]] for spin-1/2 particles
*the [[Bargmann–Wigner equations]] for particles of any spin

In quantum field equations, it is common to use [[momentum]] components of the particle instead of position coordinates of the particle's location, the fields are in [[momentum space]] and [[Fourier transform]]s relate them to the position representation.

[[File:Fire dancer.JPG|thumb|300px|A Hawaiian fire knife dancer]]

The '''fire knife''' is a traditional [[Samoan culture|Samoan cultural]] implement that is used in ceremonial dances.  It was originally composed of a [[machete]] wrapped in towels on both ends with a portion of the blade exposed in the middle.   Tribal performers of fire knife dancing (or ''Siva Afi'' or even "Ailao Afi" as it is called in Samoa) dance while twirling the knife and doing other acrobatic stunts.  The towels are set afire during the dances thus explaining the name.

== History ==

The Siva Afi was originally performed with the Nifo Oti ( Samoan war club ) which is very dangerous as the steel of the Nifo oti heats up and burns  . The modern fire knife dance has its roots in the ancient Samoan exhibition called "ailao" – the flashy demonstration of a Samoan warrior's battle prowess through artful twirling, throwing and catching, and dancing with a war club. The 'ailao could be performed with any warclub, and some colonial accounts confirm that women also performed 'ailao at the head of ceremonial processions, especially daughters of high chiefs. During night dances torches were often twirled and swung about by dancers, although a warclub was the usual implement used for 'ailao. Before the introduction of metals, the most common clubs that were wielded and displayed in the 'ailao fashion were elaborately carved heirloom clubs called "anava". These 'anava were frequently carved with serrated edges and jagged "teeth" which characterized the unique Samoan weapon called the "nifo'oti".

When European and American whalers and traders began commercial ventures in Samoa, they introduced the natives to the long-handled blubber knife and the hooked [[cane knife]]. The characteristic metal hook of these tools was readily incorporated into the Samoan wooden nifo'oti, which bears the unique hooked element whether carved from wood or forged from steel. One common claim is that the word "nifo'oti" means "tooth of death", but this is not linguistically accurate as Samoan syntax places the modifier after the subject; according to Samoan grammar the term "nifo'oti" would actually mean "dead tooth", hardly as intimidating as the former translation. One more linguistic issue remains to be worked out in regards to 'oti (with the initial glottal stop) and "oti" (without the glottal stop). When pronounced with the glottal stop, the word 'oti does not mean "death" at all; as a verb, 'oti means "to cut" as in 'otiulu ("hair cut") or as a noun it refers to the domestic goat. Therefore, the most probable derivation of the term "nifo'oti" stems from the resemblance of the weapon's hook to the curved horn ("nifo) of a goat ('oti), or from the serrated teeth ("nifo") that formed the weapon's cutting edge ('oti).

=== The Expulsion of The Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki (King of Tonga) &amp; The Birth of [[Malietoa]] (King of Samoa): ===

Ancient Samoan Legend speaks of hundreds of warriors whom would practice ailao with the ends of their weapons on fire the Nifo Oti ( Samoan war club )as part of their training. The warriors became very skilled and began to use and add many skillful maneuvers and spinning tricks to their ailao fire training, eventually becoming highly skilled combatants. Samoan warriors were called upon to dance and entertain the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki during a birthday celebration for the King of Tonga.  The Tongans had ruled parts of Samoa Upolu and Savai'i but were not able to conquer the Eastern Samoan Islands namely Manu'a (American Samoa) and Manono whose warriors famously held off Tongan and Fijian invasions on numerous occasions. The Manu'a warriors were renown throughout Eastern Polynesia for their strength and ferocity.  

For approximately 200 years the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki established a long-term residence at Safotu, Savai'i, Samoa.  The location for the Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki's birthday Festivities was a beautiful famous stretch of beach in Aleipata a region on the Eastern side of Upolu.  The Samoan warriors arrived to prepare their entertainment for Tu'i Tonga Talakaifaiki, the [[Samoans]] buried weapons nifo oti, in the sand all around the beach area, as they plied the Tongans with "bush gin".  Then they utilized their nifo oti, which has remained the same design for the last millennia, as those favored when the Samoans were actually head hunters, and the nifo-oti beheaded the victim while the hook carried the trophy.  Of course this way of life had long since been abandoned but the nifo-oti were still extremely lethal.  

As the Festivities and party progressed, and more "bush gin" was consumed, as night set in the Samoan warriors "performed" for the king.  They had wrapped both ends of their nifo-oti with dry palm sennit which was then dipped into the fires to create a blaze on one end of the knife.  They danced and pointed out the locations of the buried weapons, to other Samoan warriors who waited, in small paopaos (canoes) offshore. The warriors then stormed the beach, recovered the weapons and set them ablaze as they proceeded to drive the Tongans in a bloody battle all the way across the island, from east to the western most point of Upolu, where the Tongans whom were not killed, eventually boarded boats and left Samoa for good.&lt;ref&gt;[[Malietoa]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The young man Tavita Vaoifi revived the Samoan ailao Siva Afi dance, to eventually bring it home to Samoa.  He had won a scholarship from the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints.  This was while WWII was being fought in part, in his beloved South Pacific.  When he was able to come to America he went to school, worked, and danced.  After he read this information, in his spare time, he researched anything that he could find about his homeland.  This story stuck him deeply, because he had never heard of this from his elders.  He was determined to incorporate this treasure into his island dance routine.  After many cuts, burns, and narrow escapes he was able to perfect this dance to the point where he performed it nightly at clubs and shows throughout, not only the San Francisco area but the entire country.

Fire was added to the knife in 1946 by a Samoan knife dancer named [[Freddie Letuli]], later to become Paramount Chief Letuli Olo Misilagi.
Letuli was performing in San Francisco and noticed a Hindu [[Fire eating|Fire eater]] and a little girl with lighted batons. The fire eater loaned him some fuel, he wrapped some towels around his knife, and the fire knife dance was born.

Although today many commercial performers perform the dance with short staffs or unbladed knives, this is not authentic fire knife dance and is unacceptable in the Samoas except for training purposes. The knives used by performers in [[American Samoa]] are still made of machetes, although they are often dulled for younger dancers.

== Competition ==

Traditional competitions were hotly contested.  Their exhibitionists would almost rather die than seek medical care for injuries incurred while performing.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}  Today, modern competitions are held annually at the [[Polynesian Cultural Center]] to name the World Fireknife Champion.  The competition began in 1992 and is always held during the third week of May.  In 2007, the championships were expanded to welcome competitors in a duet category and a women's category. In 2010 the event expanded to four nights including a two-night, three-person final competition.

Champions by year are:
* 2017: Falaniko Penesa (Samoa)
* 2016: Mikaele Oloa (Waialua, Hawaii)
* 2015: Joseph Cadousteau (Papeete, Tahiti)
* 2014: Viavia Tiumalu,Jr. (Orlando,Florida)

* 1995: Ifi Soo (Maui, Hawaii)
* 1994: Ifi Soo (Maui, Hawaii)
* 1993: Tauasa Sielu Avea (Laie, Hawaii)

== Modern use ==

The Samoan Siva Afi has become an integral part of any Polynesian Luau or show. Many other Polynesian Islands have implemented the Siva Afi into their own Island shows especially in the Islands of Tahiti, Hawai'i, Cook Islands Fiji and Tonga. Because of the close familial Tribal ties with the aforementioned Islands and the Samoa Islands, the fire knife dance has almost become homogenized as part of those Islands own culture.
In the mid 20th century, the ancient traditions were commercialized and westernized.  Over time the performing implement has changed.  The wooden handle gradually lengthened and the blade got shorter.  Eventually, the exposed portion was part of the handle.  Some of the moves performed in shows now are more modern and flashy than traditional battle preparations.  As such, they are often performed at accelerated speeds.  It is probable that the danger of sharpened blades and the demand for multiple daily shows by top performers has caused the sharpened blade to disappear entirely from commercial performances.  Now, when one travels to [[Hawaii]], it is quite common to see commercial '''Fire Knife Dancing''' performed with wooden or aluminum poles wrapped in towels.  These performances are often part of [[Luau]] festivities or [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] shows that include [[Poi (juggling)|Poi Ball]] performances.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14408">Modern understanding of disease is very different from the way it was understood in ancient Greece and Rome. The way modern physicians approach healing of the sick differs greatly from the methods used by early general healers or elite physicians like Hippocrates or Galen. In modern medicine, the understanding of disease stems from the “germ theory of disease”, a concept that emerged in the second half of the 19th century, such that a disease is the result of an invasion of a microorganism into a living host. Therefore, when a person becomes ill, modern treatments “target” the specific pathogen or bacterium in order to “beat” or “kill” the disease. In Ancient Greece and Rome, disease was literally understood as dis-ease, or physical imbalance. Medical intervention, therefore, was purposed with goal of restoration of harmony rather than waging a war against disease.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=John|title=Food in Antiquity|date=1995|publisher=University of Exeter Press|isbn=0-85989-418-5|page=345|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surgery was regarded by Greek and Roman physicians as extreme and damaging while prevention was seen as the crucial first step to healing almost all ailments. In both prevention and treatment of disease in classical medicine, food and diet was central. The eating of correctly-balanced foods made up the majority of preventative treatment as well as to restore harmony to the body after it encountered disease.

== Food and Diet in Ancient Greece ==

=== Humours and Causes of Disease ===
Ancient Greek Medicine is described as rational, ethical and based upon observation, conscious learning and experience. Superstition and religious dogmatism are often excluded from descriptions of ancient Greek medicine. It is important, however, to note that this rational approach to medicine did not always exist in the ancient Greek medical world, nor was it the only popular method of healing. Along with rational Greek medicine, disease was also thought of as being of supernatural origin, resulting from the unhappiness of the gods or from demonic possession. Exorcists and religious healers were among the ‘doctors’ that patients sought out when they became ill. Sacrifices, exorcisms, spells and prayers were then carried out in order to reconcile with the gods and restore health to the patient. It was not until the time of [[Hippocrates]], between 450 and 350 BC, that rational, observation and the humoral theory of medicine began to become highly influential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Nutton|first1=Vivian|title=Healing and the healing act in Classical Greece|journal=European Review|date=1999|volume=7|issue=1|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory of the humours or “[[Humorism]]” understood the human body to be composed of fluid (humours) and regarded disease as a result of an imbalance of the four humors: yellow bile, black bile, phlegm and blood.[[File:Humorism.svg|thumb|The four humours and their qualities]] These humours contain qualities such as hot, cool, moist, dry, etc., which must also remain in balance.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|337}} Foods can be heating, cooling, or generative of one humour. Some foods produce good juices and others bad juices and often times cooking and preparation of the foods can change or improve the juices of the foods. In addition, foods may be easy to assimilate (easy to pass through the body), easily excreted, nourishing or not nourishing.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|338}}  In Hippocratic medicine, the qualities in foods are analogous to the four humors in the body: too much of a single one is bad, a proper mixture is ideal.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|347}} Therefore, the consumption of correctly-balanced foods and life-style of the patient was crucial to the prevention and treatment of disease in Ancient Greece.

This brings us to the way in which [[seasonal food]] played an important role in the treatment of ancient disease. According to the Hippocratic author of “Airs, Waters and Places” (there remains debate as to whether Hippocrates himself wrote the Hippocratic Corpus), it is important that a physician learn astronomy because, “the changes of the seasons produce changes in diseases,”.&lt;ref name=Hippocratic&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chadwick|first1=edited with an introduction by G.E.R. Lloyd ; translated [from the Greek] by J.|last2=al.]|first2=W.N. Mann ... [et|title=Hippocratic writings|date=1983|publisher=Penguin|location=Harmondsworth|isbn=0-14-044451-3|page=149|edition=[New] ed., with additional material, Repr. in Penguin classics.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same Hippocratic text, the author goes on to explain that villages facing east and that are exposed to winds from the north-east, south-east and west tended to be healthy and, “The climate in such a district may be compared with the spring in that there are no extremes of heat and cold. As a consequence, diseases in such a district are few and not severe,”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|151}} As an example of the importance of seasonal food on maintaining balance of the humours and preventing disease is given by Hippocrates in “On Regimen” when the authors state that, “in winter, to secure a dry and hot body it is better to eat wheaten bread, roast meat, and few vegetables; whereas in summer it is appropriate to eat barley cake, barley meat and softer foods,” (qtd. in Wilkins et al., p.&amp;nbsp;346).

=== Food and Diet in the Hippocratic Aphorisms ===
Food and diet feature prominently in the aphorisms of the Hippocratic Corpus. For example, in one aphorism in the first section, Hippocrates states, “Things which are growing have the greatest natural warmth and, accordingly, need most nourishment. Failing this the body becomes exhausted. Old men have little warmth and they need little food which produces warmth; too much only extinguishes the warmth they have. For this reason, fevers are not so acute in old people for then the body is cold”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|208}} Another aphorism says, “It is better to be full of drink than full of food”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|209}} And finally, an aphorism that generally sums up treatment of disease in Hippocratic times states, “Disease which results from over-eating is cured by fasting; disease following fasting, by a surfeit. So with other things; cures may be effected by opposites,”.&lt;ref name="Hippocratic" /&gt;{{rp|210}} This concept of treating diseases opposite to the way it manifests in the individual is concept that is carried over into Roman medicine.

=== Gout in Ancient Greece ===
[[Gout]] was called podagra in ancient Greek medicine and is a common arthritis caused by deposition of monosodium urate crystals within the joints.&lt;ref name=Gritzalis&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gritzalis|first1=Konstantinos C.|title=Gout in the Writings of Eminent Ancient Greek and Byzantine Physicians|journal=Acta med-hist Adriat|date=2011|volume=9|issue=1|page=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gout usually affects the first metatarsophalangeal joint of the big toe and later the other joints of the feet and hands. Hippocrates considered gout to be the result of an accumulation of one of the body humours that distended the joint and caused pain.&lt;ref name=Gout&gt;{{cite book|last1=Porter|first1=Roy|last2=Rousseau|first2=G.S.|title=Gout: The Patrician Malady|date=2000|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=0-300-08274-6|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippocrates also believed gout to be a result from sexual excess or too rich a diet as alluded to in three of his aphorisms “Eunuchs do not take the gout nor become bald”, “A woman does not take the gout unless her menses has stopped”, and “A young man does not take the gout until he indulges coitus”.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|84}}&lt;ref name="Gout" /&gt;{{rp|14–15}} As with other diseases, physicians in antiquity believed that diet was the best way to manage gout. Hippocrates recommended high doses of white hellebore because he believed that the best and most natural relief for gout was dysentery.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|85}} However, purging with white hellebore was probably for the more chronic cases due to the fact that wine and barleywater drinks were very strongly recommended.&lt;ref name="Gout" /&gt;{{rp|16–17}}

=== Legumes in Ancient Greece ===
The importance of legumes in ancient Greek diet and medical practice is often disregarded. However, legumes improved the quality of the soil and were considered very important to the agriculturalists of the time. Additionally, legumes contain a high amount of albumen, which led them to be a critical dietary supplement in countries where meat was in short supply and difficult to store. Such was the case with Greece. People in the Graeco-Roman world consumed less meat than we do today and therefore, legumes were a necessary source of protein.&lt;ref name="Legumes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Flint-Hamilton|first1=Kimberly B.|title=Legumes in Ancient Greece and Rome: Food, Medicine, or Poison?|journal=Hesperia: The Journal of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens|date=1999|volume=68|issue=3|page=374|jstor=148493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all legumes, the [[lentil]] [[File:Illustration Lens culinaris0.jpg|thumb|The lentil plant]] appears most frequently in Greek and Roman literature. Medicinally, Hippocrates recommends lentils as a remedy for ulcers and hemorrhoids.&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|376}} Bitter vetch, or [[Vicia ervilia]], was also an important legume in ancient Greek medicine. The extensive medicinal qualities of the bitter vetch were thought reliable enough to later administer to Roman emperors such as [[Augustus]].&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|379}} Bitter vetch was thought to heal pimples, prevent sores from spreading and soothe spots or sores when they appear on the breasts. It was also reported to relieve painful urination, flatulence, liver problems, and indigestion when roasted and mixed with honey and Hippocrates cautioned that when eaten boiled or raw, the consumption of bitter vetch may cause more flatulence or pain.&lt;ref name="Legumes" /&gt;{{rp|379}}

== Food and Diet in Ancient Rome ==

=== Humours, Anatomy and the Causes of Disease ===
At the heart of Roman Medicine and central to the development of Western Medicine is [[Galen]] [[File:Galenus.jpg|thumb|The Eminent Galen of Pergamum]]of Pergamum (AD 129–c. AD 210).&lt;ref name=WMT&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conrad|first1=Lawrence I.|title=The Western medical tradition, 800 BC to AD 1800|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-47564-3|pages=58–70|edition=Reprinted.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen was a prolific writer from whose surviving works comes what Galen believed to be the definitive guide to a healthy diet, based on the theory of the four humours.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grant|first1=Mark|title=Galen on Food and DIet|date=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0-415-23232-5|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galen understood the humoral theory in a dynamic sense rather than static sense such that yellow bile is hot and dry like fire; black bile is dry and cold like earth; phlegm is cold and moist like water; and blood is moist and hot.&lt;ref name="A History of Medicine"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Prioreschi|first1=Plinio|title=A History of Medicine: Roman medicine|date=1998|publisher=Edwin Mellen Press|isbn=978-1-888456-03-5|page=360}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also understood the humours to be produced by food through digestion and it is with digestion, and respiration, that Galen applies his knowledge of anatomy. According to Galen, digestion begins in the mouth because this where food comes into contact with the saliva. The chewed food is then pulled into the stomach where the heat of the stomach cooks the food into chyle. The chyle is then carried to the liver where the nutrients are converted to blood and transported throughout the body,.&lt;ref name="A History of Medicine" /&gt;{{rp|420–421}} With this understanding of the humours as being dynamic, and his knowledge of anatomy, Galen was able to categorize illnesses as hot, cold, dry or moist and attribute the causes of these illnesses to specific types of foods. For example, in Galen’s own “On the Causes of Disease”, as cited by Mark Grant, Galen says when describing hot diseases that, “[one cause of excessive heat] lies in foods that have hot and harsh powers, such as garlic, leeks, onions, and so on. Immoderate use of these foods sometimes sparks a fever,”.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food" /&gt;{{rp|48}} Galen believed that a good physician must also be a good cook.&lt;ref name="Galen on Food" /&gt;{{rp|11}} Therefore, in Galen’s dietary treatise “On the Powers of Foods”, recipes are often given in addition to descriptions of foods as being salty or sweet, sour or watery, difficult or easy to digest, costive or laxative, cooling or heating, etc. Galen insists that the balance of the four humours can be beneficially or adversely effected by ‘diet’ which in Galenic medicine includes not just food and drink but also physical exercise, baths, massage, and climate&lt;ref name="selected works"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=P.N|title=Galen selected works|date=1997|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=England|isbn=978-0-19-158627-9 |page=X|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;scope=site&amp;db=nlebk&amp;db=nlabk&amp;AN=12310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Food and the Treatment of Disease in Ancient Rome ===
As mentioned, certain types of food can affect the balance of the humours in different ways. According to Galen’s “On Humours,” as referenced by Wilkins et al., beef, camel, and goat meat, snails, cabbage, and soft cheeses produce black bile; brains, fungi, and hard apples cause phlegm; bitter almonds and garlic reduce phlegm.&lt;ref name="Food in Antiquity" /&gt;{{rp|377}} Additionally, for the treatment of gout, Galen suggested a range of dressings to be applied to the affected area made of mandrake, caper, and henbane and for the acute phase, creams made of seeds of conium, mushroom, and deer brain were administered.&lt;ref name="Gritzalis" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

'''Health Systems Engineering''' or '''Health Engineering''' (often known as "Health Care Systems Engineering (HCSE)") is an academic and a pragmatic discipline that approaches the [[health care]] industry, and other industries connected with health care delivery, as [[complex adaptive system]]s, and identifies and applies engineering design and analysis principles in such areas. This can overlap with [[biomedical engineering]] which focuses on design and development of various medical products; [[industrial engineering]] and [[operations management]] which involve improving organizational operations; and various health care practice fields like [[medicine]], [[pharmacy]], [[dentistry]], [[nursing]], etc.  Other fields participating in this interdisciplinary area include [[public health]], [[information technology]], [[management]] studies, and regulatory [[law]].

People whose work implicates this field in some capacity can include members of all the above-noted fields, many of which have sub-fields targeted toward health care matters even if health or health care is not a principal focus of the overall field (e.g. management, law). Areas of [[biomedical engineering]] (BME) in this area often include [[clinical engineering]] (sometimes also called "hospital engineering") as well as those BMEs developing [[medical devices]] and [[pharmaceutical drug]]s.  The [[industrial engineering]] (IE) principles employed tend to include optimization, decision analysis, [[human factors engineering]], quality engineering, and value engineering.

A '''heartbeat message''' in signal processing is a message sent from an originator to a destination that enables the destination to identify if and when the originator fails or is no longer available.&lt;ref name="att01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=gVQ3AAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent 4,710,926 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |author=Brown|date=1987-12-01|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heartbeat messages are typically sent non-stop on a [[periodic_function|periodic]] or recurring basis from the originator's start-up until the originator's shutdown. When the destination identifies a lack of heartbeat messages during an anticipated arrival period, the destination may determine that the originator has failed, shutdown, or is generally no longer available.  Heartbeat messages may be used for [[high-availability]] and [[fault tolerance]] purposes.

Norway’s '''home economics schools''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''Husmorskoler''), or '''technical schools for domestic arts''' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''fagskoler i husstell'') arose at the end of the 19th century for the purpose of providing specialized instruction in domestic subjects. The schools developed in parallel with agricultural schools ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''[[landbruksskole]]r'') and were intended to teach [[outline of food preparation|food preparation]] and housework. Later these home economics schools were also established in Norway's cities. The schools in the countryside were generally governed by [[Counties of Norway|county councils]] ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]: ''fylkeskommuner'') and town schools by municipal governments.

In the 1960s the home economics schools were renamed as technical schools for domestic arts (''fagskoler i husstell''). The schools weren’t regulated by law before the [[Secondary education law (Norway)|secondary education law]] (''Lov om videregående opplæring'') came into effect in 1974. The home economics schools then became a part of the secondary education program, on an equal footing with [[Gymnasium_(school)#North_European_countries|gymnasiums]] (university preparation schools) and [[professional school (Norway)|practical and professional school]]s (''yrkeskoler'') specializing in business and technical programs. Following the 1976 secondary education law, the gymnasiums were consolidated with the practical and professional schools into a unified secondary education system. Nowadays instruction in restaurant work, food and nutrition is offered as a program discipline within Norway's overall secondary education program.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2265">'''Hypertext''', in [[semiotics]], is a text which alludes, derives from, or relates to an earlier work or [[hypotext]].&lt;ref name="Martin2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Bronwen|title=Key Terms in Semiotics|year=2006|publisher=Continuum|page=99}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' could be regarded as one of the many hypertexts deriving from [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'';  [[Angela Carter]]'s "The Tiger's Bride" can be considered a hypertext which relates to an earlier work, or hypotext, the original fairy-story ''[[Beauty and the Beast]]''. Hypertexts may take a variety of forms including [[imitation]], [[parody]], and [[pastiche]].

The word was defined by the French theorist [[Gérard Genette]] as follows: "Hypertextuality refers to any relationship uniting a text B (which I shall call the ''hypertext'') to an earlier text A (I shall, of course, call it the [[hypotext]]), upon which it is grafted in a manner that is not that of commentary."&lt;ref name="Genette1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=Genette|first=Gérard |title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree|year=1997|publisher=U of Nebraska Press|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a hypertext derives from hypotext(s) through a process which Genette calls transformation, in which text B "evokes" text A without necessarily mentioning it directly ".&lt;ref name="Herman1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Herman|first=David|title=Palimpsests: Literature in the Second Degree (review)|year=1998|publisher=MFS Modern Fiction Studies|pages=1043–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note that this technical use of the word in semiotics differs from its use to mean a link in the field of , although the two are related. Liestøl's study of Genette's narratological model and [[hyperfiction]] considers how they are related and suggests that hyperfiction narratives have four levels:&lt;ref name="Liestol1994"&gt;{{cite book|last=Liestøl|first=Gunnar|chapter=Wittgenstein, Genette, and the Reader's Narrative in Hypertext|title=

In biology, an '''indumentum''' ([[Latin]], literally: "garment") is a covering of [[trichome]]s (fine "hairs") on a [[plant]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Davis, Peter Hadland]] and [[Heywood, Vernon Hilton]] (1963) ''Principles of angiosperm taxonomy'' Van Nostrandpage, Princeton, New Jersey, page 154, {{OCLC|552236}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of [[bristle]]s (rarely scales) of an [[insect]].{{fact|date=March 2013}} 

In plants, indumentum types include:
*pubescent
*hirsute
*pilose
*villous
*[[tomentose]]
*stellate
*scabrous
*scurfy
{{more|Trichome}}
The indumentum on [[plant]]s can have a wide variety of functions, including as anchorage in climbing plants (e.g., ''[[Galium aparine]]''), in transpiration control, in water absorption (''[[Tillandsia]]''), the reflection of solar radiation, increasing water-repellency (e.g., in the aquatic fern ''[[Salvinia]]''), in protection against insect predation, and in the trapping of insects (''[[Drosera]]'', ''[[Nepenthes]]'', ''[[Stylosanthes]]''). 
  
The use of an indumentum on [[insect]]s can also be [[pollen]]-related, as on [[bee]]s, [[sensory organ|sensory]] like [[whisker]]s, or for varied other uses including [[adhesion]] and [[poison]].{{cn|date=December 2013}}

The '''Institute of Aesthetic Research''' ('''Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas''') of the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], since its foundation in 1936, research has been carried out in its installations into the [[Mexican art|different forms of artistic expression in Mexico]]; the diversity of studies undertaken by the body of researchers in the fields of criticism, theory and history of art across a horizon that reaches other latitudes. It has thus become a space in which the plastic arts converge with dance, literature, photography, cinema and music.

Every year, through its International Colloquium on Art History, the Institute opens its doors to academic reflection on the history of art. Since 1975, this space has been a meeting point for the voices of both Mexican and foreign researchers.

To perform its tasks of study and dissemination, both of Mexican art and that of other countries, the Institute harbors a number of different areas, each of which has its particular sphere of interest:
*The Manuel Toussaint Photographic Archive conserves the collections of images which serve as a support for academic activities. With over 750,000 images, the Archive grown to be the country’s most important depositary of visual documents related to Mexican art; it also has a specialized conservation laboratory. The tasks carried out in the Archive range from the lending of materials for consultation to the organization of photographic exhibitions for museums in Mexico and abroad.
*The collection of the Justino Fernández Library is the most important and extensive in Latin America as regards material devoted to the study of art. It provides an invaluable support for research through its programs of donations and exchanges of books and interlibrary interchange and loans; it also participates, by means of its book and periodical collections, in different exhibitions and in the production of television programs.
*The Documentary Investigation Department carries out research activities in different archives in Mexico. Its labors are concentrated in the Catalogues of art documents. These tools help to orient the Institute’s investigations and represent a significant labor of collaboration in its output.
*The Laboratory for Diagnosis of Works of Art participates in projects aimed at researching and conserving the national artistic heritage, by means of the analysis of materials and procedures used in the creation of works of art.
*In December, 2007, the Hypermedia Laboratory commenced its activities. In it are concentrated the Institute community’s interests in exploiting the possibilities of digital technology for the study, investigation and dissemination of art history.
*The most important medium for disseminating the Institute’s research are printed books. Every title published by the Publications Department is an endorsement of the Institute’s commitment to maintaining the exceptional quality that has been attained by its printed media. In this effort it is accompanied by the journal Anales del Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, which, twice-yearly, offers in its pages the work of prestigious researchers from all over the world.

The distribution of the Institute’s publications is not limited to the UNAM’s system of libraries, but extends to other sales outlets. The electronic shop, still under construction, is also oriented towards the same /will also make a contribution to this effort, bringing the Institute’s work to a broader public.

The journal Imágenes is an electronic publication which offers various articles publicizing the Institute’s academic activities and other news items to do with the history of art. Its contents and characteristics have made it the most visited section of the Institute’s electronic portal.

In August, 2007, work started at the new branch headquarters of the Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas in the City of Oaxaca, which are lodged in an old domestic building in the Alameda de León, which dates from the eighteenth century and was received by the UNAM in commodatum in 2005.

This branch is home to a library—comprising over six thousand volumes—which belonged to Dr. Beatriz de la Fuente, among which are some facsimiles of [[pre-Hispanic codices]]. The library is endowed with the necessary features for operating as a videoconference room. The equipment installed is similar to that in the Francisco de la Maza room in the Institute’s headquarters on the University campus in Mexico City, thus facilitating constant communication between both. It is to be hoped that this study center will become a point of reference for the south of the country and for the whole of Central America.

'''Islamic studies''' refers to the study of [[Islam]]. Islamic studies can be seen under at least two perspectives:&lt;ref&gt;Clinton Bennett: [https://books.google.com/books?id=pHweBQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;hl=de&amp;pg=PA2 The Bloomsbury Companion to Islamic Studies], 2013, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

* From a secular perspective, Islamic studies is a field of academic research whose subject is Islam as religion and civilization. 

* From a traditional Islamic perspective, Islamic studies is an [[umbrella term]] for religious sciences ('''Ulum al-din'') pursued by the [[ulama]].

==Overview==
In a [[Muslim]] context, '''Islamic studies''' is the [[umbrella term]] for the Islamic sciences ('''Ulum al-din''). It includes all the traditional forms of religious thought, such as ''[[kalam]]'' (Islamic theology) and ''[[fiqh]]'' (Islamic jurisprudence), but also incorporates fields generally considered [[secular]] in the West, such as [[Islamic science]] and [[Islamic economics]].

In a non-Muslim context, Islamic studies generally refers to the [[History of Islam|historical study of Islam]]: [[Islamic civilization (disambiguation)|Islamic civilization]]&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt;, [[Islamic history]] and [[historiography]], [[Islamic law]], [[Islamic theology]] and [[Islamic philosophy]]. Academics from diverse disciplines participate and exchange ideas about Islamic societies, past and present, although Western, academic Islamic studies itself is in many respects a self-conscious and self-contained field. Specialists in the discipline apply methods adapted from several ancillary fields, ranging from [[Biblical studies]] and [[classical philology]] to [[modern history]], [[legal history]] and [[sociology]]. A recent trend, particularly since [[9/11]], has been the study of contemporary [[Islamist]] groups and movements by academics from the [[social sciences]] or in many cases by journalists, although since such works tend to be written by non-[[Arabists]] they belong outside the field of Islamic studies proper.

Scholars in the field of academic Islamic studies are often referred to as "Islamicists" and the discipline traditionally made up the bulk of what used to be called [[Oriental studies]].  In fact, some of the more traditional Western universities still confer degrees in Arabic and Islamic studies under the primary title of "Oriental studies".  This is the case, for example, at the [[University of Oxford]], where Classical Arabic and Islamic studies have been taught since as early as the 16th century, originally as a sub-division of [[Divinity]]. This latter context gave early academic Islamic studies its Biblical studies character and was also a consequence of the fact that throughout early-Modern Western Europe the discipline was developed by churchmen whose primary aim had actually been to refute the tenets of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert Irwin, 'For Lust of Knowing: the Orientalists and their Enemies'.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their now generally secular, academic approach, many non-Muslim Islamic studies scholars have written works which are widely read by Muslims, while in recent decades an increasing number of Muslim-born scholars have trained and taught as academic Islamicists in Western universities. Many leading universities in Europe and the US offer [[academic degrees]] at both undergraduate and postgraduate level in Islamic studies, in which students can also study Arabic and therefore begin to read Islamic texts in the original language. Because Arabic and Islamic studies are generally seen as inseparable in academia, named undergraduate degrees that combine the two are usually still categorized as single-subject degrees rather than as 'joint' or 'combined' degrees like, for example, those in Arabic and Politics. This rationale explains why, because of their heavy emphasis on the detailed study of Islamic texts in [[Classical Arabic]], some institutions{{spaced ndash}}such as the School of Oriental and African Studies ([[SOAS]]) in London and [[Georgetown University]] in Washington DC{{spaced ndash}}only accept graduates who already have degree-level Arabic and a strong background in the academic study of Islam onto their Masters programmes in Islamic studies. Such institutions will generally direct students new to the field and with little or no Arabic to broader master's degrees in [[Middle Eastern studies]] or [[Middle East politics]], in which Arabic can be studied ''[[ab initio]]''.

A recent HEFCE report emphasises the increasing, strategic importance for Western governments since [[9/11]] of Islamic studies in [[higher education]] and also provides an international overview of the state of the field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hefce.ac.uk/media/hefce/content/pubs/indirreports/2008/re0708/rd07_08.doc&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2009}}

Islamic studies is often argued by Muslims, to begin with, the founding of the Islamic religion by [[Abraham]], continue throughout the history of Judaism with Islamic Prophets such as David and Solomon, then early Christianity with Jesus in particular, and then up to modern times with the final revelation of God as revealed to the Prophet Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|42|13|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|4|163|s=ns}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first attempt to understand [[Islam]] as a topic of modern scholarship (as opposed to a Christological heresy) was within the context of 19th-century Christian European [[Oriental studies]].

In the years 1821 to 1850, the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] in England, the [[Société Asiatique]] in France, the [[Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft]] in Germany, and the [[American Oriental Society]] in the United States were founded.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;The Oxford Encyclopedia of the Islamic World: [http://www.oxfordislamicstudies.com/article/opr/t236/e0395 ''Islamic Studies''] - History of the field, Methodology&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2nd half of the 19th century, philological and historical approaches were predominant. Leading in the field were German researchers like [[Theodore Nöldeke]] 's study on the history of the Quran, or [[Ignaz Goldziher]] 's work on the prophetic tradition.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Western orientalists and Muslim scholars alike preferred to interpret the history of Islam in a conservative way. They did not question the traditional account of the early time of Islam, of Muhammad and how the Quran was written.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In the 1970s, the [[Revisionist School of Islamic Studies]] questioned the uncritical adherence to traditional Islamic sources and started to develop a new picture of the earliest times of Islam by applying the [[historical-critical method]].&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Stille: [https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/02/arts/scholars-are-quietly-offering-new-theories-of-the-koran.html?pagewanted=all Scholars Are Quietly Offering New Theories of the Koran], New York Times 02 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toby Lester: [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/01/what-is-the-koran/304024/ What Is the Koran?] in: The Atlantic issue January 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Themes ==

===History of Islam===
{{main|History of Islam}}
To understand the history of Islam provides the indispensable basis to understand all aspects of Islam and its culture. Themes of special interest are:
* [[Historiography of early Islam]]
* [[History of the Quran]]
* [[Historicity of Muhammad]]
* [[Early Muslim conquests]]

===Theology===
{{Main|Islamic theology|Kalam}}
''Kalam'' ({{lang|ar|{{big|علم الكلام}}}}) is one of the "religious sciences" of Islam. In [[Arabic language|Arabic]], the word means "discussion" and refers to the Islamic tradition of seeking theological principles through [[dialectic]]. A scholar of ''kalam'' is referred to as a ''mutakallim''.

* [[Islamic eschatology]]

===Mysticism===
{{main|Sufism}}

Sufism ({{lang|ar|{{big|تصوف}}}} ''taṣawwuf'') is a [[Mysticism|mystic]] [[tradition]] of Islam based on the pursuit of spiritual truth as it is gradually revealed to the heart and mind of the Sufi (one who practices Sufism).

It might also be referred to as Islamic mysticism. While other branches of Islam generally focus on [[exoteric]] aspects of religion, Sufism is mainly focused on the direct perception of [[truth]] or [[God]] through mystic practices based on divine love. Sufism embodies a number of [[culture]]s, philosophies, central teachings and bodies of [[esoteric knowledge]].

===Law===
{{main|Sharia|Fiqh}}
Islamic jurisprudence relates to everyday and social issues in the life of Muslims. It is divided in fields like:
* the study of [[sharia]] law
* [[Islamic economics]]
* [[Qur'an]] and [[Hadith]] studies  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.academia.edu/11796624/Knowledge_of_Shariah_and_Knowledge_to_Manage_Self_and_System_Integration_of_Islamic_Epistemology_with_the_Knowledge_and_Education|title=Knowledge of Shariah and Knowledge to Manage ‘Self’ and ‘System’: Integration of Islamic Epistemology with the Knowledge and Education|first=Tareq M|last=Zayed|publisher=|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key distinctions include those between ''[[fiqh]]'', ''[[hadith]]'' and ''[[ijtihad]]''.

===Philosophy===
{{main|Islamic philosophy}}
Islamic philosophy is a part of Islamic studies. It is a longstanding attempt to create harmony between [[faith]], reason or [[philosophy]], and the religious teachings of [[Islam]]. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a [[List of Muslim philosophers|Muslim philosopher]].

It is divided in fields like:
* [[Early Islamic philosophy]]
** [[Avicennism]]
** [[Averroism]]
* [[Islamic philosophy]]
* [[Modern Islamic philosophy]]
** [[Sufi philosophy]]
** [[Transcendent theosophy]]
* [[List of Muslim philosophers]]
* [[Illuminationist philosophy]]
* [[Islamic ethics]]
* [[Sufi metaphysics]]

===Sciences===
{{main|Islam and science|Science in medieval Islam}}
[[Islam and science]] is [[science]] in the context of traditional religious ideas of [[Islam]], including its [[ethics]] and prohibitions. A Muslim engaged in this field is called a [[Muslim scientist]]

This is not the same as science as conducted by any [[Muslim]] in a secular context. Certain [[liberal movements in Islam]] eschew the practice of Islamic science, arguing that science should be considered separate from religion as it is today in the West. As in [[Catholicism]] however, believers argue that the guiding role of religion in forming ethics of science cannot be ignored and must impose absolute constraints on inquiry.
* [[Qur'an and science]]
* [[Islamic creationism]]

[[Science in medieval Islam]] examines the full range of scientific investigation in the [[Muslim world]], whether performed within a religious or secular context. Significant progress in science was made in the Muslim world during the [[Middle Ages]], especially during the [[Islamic Golden Age]], which is considered a major period in the [[history of science]].
* [[Timeline of Islamic science and engineering]]
* [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam]]
* [[Astronomy in medieval Islam]]
** [[Islamic astrology]]
* [[Inventions in medieval Islam]]
* [[Mathematics in medieval Islam]]
* [[Medicine in medieval Islam]]
** [[Ophthalmology in medieval Islam]]
* [[Physics in medieval Islam]]
* [[Psychology in medieval Islam]]

===Literature===
{{main|Islamic literature}}
* [[Arabic literature]]
** [[Arabic epic literature]]
* [[Islamic poetry]]
** [[Arabic poetry]]
* [[Persian literature]]

This field includes the study of [[Arabic Language|modern]] and [[classical Arabic]] and the literature written in those languages. It also often includes other modern, classic or ancient languages of the [[Middle East]] and other areas that are or have been part of, or influenced by, Islamic culture, such as [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Urdu language|Urdu]], [[Azeri|Azerbaijanian]] and [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]].

===Architecture===
{{main|Islamic architecture}}
Islamic architecture is the entire range of architecture that has evolved within [[Muslim culture]] in the course of the [[history of Islam]]. Hence the term encompasses religious buildings as well as secular ones, historic as well as modern expressions and the production of all places that have come under the varying levels of Islamic influence.

It is very common to mistake [[Iranian architecture|Persian architecture]] for Islamic architecture.

===Art===
{{main|Islamic art}}
* [[Islamic calligraphy]]
* [[Islamic pottery]]
* [[Muslim music]]

[[Islam]]ic visual [[art]] has, throughout history, been mainly abstract and decorative, portraying geometric, floral, [[Arabesque (Islamic art)|Arabesque]], and [[calligraphy|calligraphic]] designs. Unlike the strong tradition of portraying the human figure in [[Christian art]], Islamic art is typically distinguished as not including depictions of human beings. The lack of [[portrait]]ure is due to the fact that early Islam forbade the painting of human beings, especially [[Muhammad|the Prophet]], as Muslims believe this tempts followers of the Prophet to [[idolatry]]. This prohibition against human beings or icons is called [[aniconism]]. Despite such a prohibition, depictions of human beings do occur Islamic art, such as that of the [[Mughals]], demonstrating a strong diversity in popular interpretation over the pre-modern period. Increased contact with the [[western world|Western civilization]] may also have contributed to human depictions in Islamic art in modern times.

===Comparative religion===
{{main|Islam and other religions}}
Islamic [[comparative religion]] is the study of religions in the view of Islam. This study may be undertaken from a conservative [[Muslim]] perspective, which often sees [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]] as having been originally similar to Islam, and later developing away from the root monotheist religion. However, some [[liberal movements within Islam]] dispute the conservative view as being ahistorical; they claim that Islam is the end-result rather than the origin point of monotheist thought.

* [[Islam and Christianity]]
* [[Islam and Jainism]]
* [[Islam and Judaism]]
** [[Judeo-Islamic philosophies (800 - 1400)]]

===Economics===
{{main|Islamic economic jurisprudence}}
Islamic economics is [[economics]] in accordance with [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Because the [[Qur'an]] spoke against [[usury]] in the context of early Muslim society, it generally entails trying to remove or redefine [[interest rates]] from financial institutions. In doing so, Islamic economists hope to produce a more "Islamic society". However, [[liberal movements within Islam]] may deny the need for this field, since they generally see Islam as compatible with modern secular institutions and law.

* [[Islamic banking]]
* [[Islamic economics in the world]]

===Psychology===
{{main|Islamic psychology}}
* [[Psychology in medieval Islam]]
* [[Sufi psychology]]
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}

===Islam and Modernity===
An interesting field of study is how Islam reacts on the contact with Western modernity, and how Islam can catch up with modernity without betraying itself. These studies comprise Islamic history, Islamic theology, Islamic Mysticism, and Islamic philosophy, as well as the study of Western philosophy, sociology and politology.

{{Ivelchester and Langport Navigation map}}
The '''Ivelchester and Langport Navigation''' was a scheme to make the River Ivel (now called the [[River Yeo (South Somerset)|River Yeo]]) navigable from [[Langport]] to [[Ilchester]], in [[Somerset]], [[England]]. Work started in 1795, but the scheme was effectively bankrupt by 1797, and construction of the locks was never completed.

==History==
[[Ilchester]] was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Barracks|garrison town]], built at the point where the [[Fosse Way]] crossed the River Ivel, and there is evidence that the Romans built quays on the river. There are mentions of boats using the river in the 13th century, and in a survey carried out in 1632 by Gerard. However, the Ivel was never a large river, and when there was inadequate water to reach Ilchester, goods were unloaded at [[Pill Bridge]], which crossed the river {{convert|1.5|mi}} downstream from the town. All goods moving from that bridge to the town had to pay tolls to the Borough of Ilchester, which increased the price of coal to the inhabitants. Navigation was also hampered by the restrictive size of the medieval bridge arch at Langport. The Ivelchester and Langport Navigation was conceived as a way of ensuring that boats could always reach the Ilchester town wharfs, and therefore duty would not be paid on goods using Pill Bridge Lane.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Construction===
Following a meeting with representatives from the [[Dorset and Somerset Canal]], which was part of a grand scheme to link the Bristol Channel to the English Channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of local businessmen obtained an [[Act of Parliament]] on 22 June 1795, which made provision for improving the river between Ilchester and Bicknell Bridge, just to the south east of Langport, and then cutting through the town along the course of the Portlake Rhine, which was then a drain, and rejoining the River Parrett below Langport lock. The act allowed the proprietors to raise £6,000 by issuing shares, and a further £2,000 in loans, if required.&lt;ref name=priestley&gt;{{harvnb |Priestley |1831 |p=352}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around three quarters of the share capital had been promised before the act was obtained, and so work commenced immediately. The plans involved widening the Portlake Rhine, building a lock close to the Little Bow bridge, near the centre of the town, and making a cut to join the River Parrett again near Bicknell's Bridge, which would include two more locks. A further four locks were to be constructed between there and Ilchester. The engineer was a local man called Josiah Easton, and good progress was made in the first six months at the Langport end of the scheme, but costs were escalating, and by October 1796, the scheme was in difficulty. The £6,000 of share capital had all been spent, but little work had been done on removing shoals from the river towards Ilchester. In 1797, outstanding debts were cleared and the scheme was effectively abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Parrett Navigation Act===
Despite the scheme not being finished, some traffic continued to use the river. The Parrett Navigation Act, which was obtained in 1836, authorised improvements to the [[River Parrett]] below Langport, the construction of a [[Westport Canal|canal to Westport]], and the rebuilding of the Great Bow Bridge, to allow larger boats to travel beyond Langport. Normal canal tolls were charged for use of the canal, and there was a toll for trade passing under the rebuilt bridge,{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=13}} but some of the shareholders felt that boat users on the River Ivel should also be charged, since the water levels on the river had improved since the construction of the  Parrett Navigation works.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Accordingly, Nicholas Broadmead, who was a solicitor, and Philip Broadmead, both of whom were shareholders in the [[Parrett Navigation Company]], set about tracing and buying the 120 shares of the original Ivelchester and Langport Canal Company. Philip Broadmead obtained professional opinions on the legality of the proposed action, and produced a document outlining the expected returns on such a scheme. Some shares were obtained, and a meeting was held on 26 September 1843 at the Castle Inn in Ilchester, but the outcome is not known, as the plan faded away, and the planned resurrection of the company did not occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb |Body |Gallop |2006 |pp=33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Today==
Little remains of the Navigation. The course of the Portlake Rhine and the channel from Bicknell's Bridge to Little Bow bridge can be made out in the landscape, but navigation on the Parrett as a whole has largely ceased because the locks have been replaced by sluices.

==History==
The Living Building Challenge was launched by the [http://cascadiagbc.org Cascadia Green Building Council] (a chapter of both the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] and [[Canada Green Building Council]]). It was created by [[Jason F. McLennan]] and Bob Berkebile, of [[BNIM]]. McLennan brought the program to Cascadia when he became its CEO in 2006. The International Living Building Institute was created of and by Cascadia in May 2009 to oversee the Living Building Challenge and its auxiliary programs. In April 2011, the International Living Building Institute was renamed the International Living Future Institute (the Institute).

===International Living Future Institute===
The [http://living-future.org/ International Living Future Institute] is a non-governmental organization (NGO) committed to catalyzing a global transformation toward true sustainability.  The Institute seeks partnerships with leaders in the public, private and not-for-profit sectors in pursuit of a future that is socially just, culturally rich and ecologically restorative.

The Institute is the umbrella organization for the Living Building Challenge and the Cascadia Green Building Council, along with [[The Natural Step]] US and Ecotone Publishing.

==Performance areas==
Living Building Challenge comprises seven performance areas: site, water, energy, health, materials, equity and beauty. These are subdivided into a total of twenty Imperatives, each of which focuses on a specific sphere of influence:

(NOTE: This chart does not include the Scale Jumping overlay allowed for some Imperatives. Scale Jumping allows multiple buildings or projects to operate in a cooperative state – sharing green infrastructure as appropriate and allowing for Living Building, Site or Community status to be achieved as elegantly and efficiently as possible.)

Certification is based on actual, rather than modeled or anticipated, performance. Therefore, projects must be operational for at least 12 consecutive months prior to evaluation. To earn 'Living' status (full program certification), projects must meet all assigned Imperatives and have proven performance through at least 12 consecutive months of operation. To celebrate successes and to educate other efforts, project teams may earn Petal Recognition (partial program certification) by satisfying the requirements of a minimum of three categories, of which at least one must be water, energy or materials. The [http://ilbi.org/lbc/certified first Living Buildings&lt;sup&gt;SM&lt;/sup&gt;] were certified in October 2010, and by March 2013, only six had achieved certification.&lt;ref name=Hartman&gt;{{cite news|last=Hartman|first=Hattie|title=Twitter brings the Living Building Challenge to the UK|url=http://www.architectsjournal.co.uk/sustainability/twitter-brings-the-living-building-challenge-to-the-uk/8644157.article|accessdate=22 April 2013|newspaper=Architects' Journal|date=15 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The targets are rigorous and set at the highest conceivable; every project must meet each of its 20 strict requirements to achieve the certification. This 'ceiling' is where far fewer than 1% of buildings assessed under BREEAM would fall and in excess of 'Outstanding' rating.&lt;ref name=Starrs /&gt;

==Projects pursuing Living Building Challenge certification==
Over 100 project teams (mainly in the US and Canada, but also one in New Zealand and another one in Ireland)&lt;ref name=Hartman /&gt; are pursuing the Challenge, most of which have officially registered with the Institute, including:

'''Lottery competition''' in [[ecology]] is a model for how organisms [[Competition (biology)|compete]].  It was first used to describe competition in coral reef fish.&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=Peter L.|last2=Warner|first2=Robert R.|title=Environmental Variability Promotes Coexistence in Lottery Competitive Systems|journal=The American Naturalist|date=June 1981|volume=117|issue=6|pages=923–943|doi=10.1086/283778}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under lottery competition, many offspring compete for a large number of sites (e.g., many [[Juvenile fish|fry]] competing for a few territories, or many seedlings competing for a few [[treefall gap]]s).  Under lottery competition, one individual is chosen randomly to "win" that site (typically becoming an adult soon after), and the "losers" typically die off.  Thus, in an analogy to a lottery or [[raffle]], every individual has an equal chance of winning (like every ticket has an equal chance of being chosen), and therefore more abundant species are proportionately more likely to win (just as an individual who buys more tickets is more likely to win).  Some models&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chesson1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chesson|first1=P.|title=Multispecies Competition in Variable Environments|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=1 June 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=227–276|doi=10.1006/tpbi.1994.1013|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040580984710136}}&lt;/ref&gt; generalize this idea by weighting some individuals who are more likely to be chosen (by analogy, this would be like some tickets counting as two tickets instead of one).

Lottery competition has been used to in understanding many key ideas in ecology, including the [[storage effect]] (species coexist because they are affected differently by environmental variation)&lt;ref name="ChessonWarner1981" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chesson1994" /&gt; and [[Unified neutral theory of biodiversity|neutral theory]] (species diversity is maintained because species are competitively equivalent, and extinction rates are slow enough to be offset by speciation and dispersal events).&lt;ref name="hubbell2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbell|first1=Stephen P.|title=The unified neutral theory of biodiversity and biogeography|date=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=0-691-02129-5|edition=Print on Demand.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chair allowed him to indulge his sexual fantasies without crushing his female partners.

[[File:Ringside.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Class ring|graduation ring]] with the Master of Science designation]]

A '''Master of Science''' ({{lang-la|Magister Scientiae}}; abbreviated '''MS''', '''M.S.''', '''MSc''', '''M.Sc.''', '''SM''', '''S.M.''', '''ScM''' or '''Sc.M.''') is a [[master's degree]] in the field of science awarded by [[University|universities]] in many countries or a person holding such a degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/master_of_science|title=Master of Science|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|work=Oxford Living Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the [[Master of Arts]] degree, the Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering and medicine and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a [[thesis]].

==Algeria==
Algeria follows the [[Bologna Process]].

==Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Colombia, Panamá, Perú and Uruguay==
In [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Panamá]], [[Perú]] and [[Uruguay]], the Master of Science or Magister is a postgraduate degree of two to four years of duration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate = 2014-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The admission to a Master's program (Spanish: ''[[Maestría]]''; Portuguese: ''Mestrado'') requires the full completion of a four to five years long [[undergraduate degree]], [[bachelor's degree]] or a [[Licentiate (degree)|Licentiate]]'s degree of the same length. Defense of a research thesis is required. All master's degrees qualify for a doctorate program.

==Australia==
Australian universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 1–2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Bangladesh==
In Bangladesh, all universities, including [[Bangladesh Agricultural University]] [[Jagannath University]], [[Dhaka University]], [[University of Chittagong]], [[Jahangirnagar University]], [[Islamic University, Bangladesh]] and [[Rajshahi University]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. After passing Bachelor of Science, any student becomes eligible to study in this discipline.

==Canada==
In Canada, Master of Science (MSc) degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a mixture. Master's programs typically take one to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required. Admission to a master's program is contingent upon holding a four-year university bachelor's degree. Some universities require a master's degree in order to progress to a doctoral program (PhD).

===Quebec===
In the province of Quebec, the Master of Science follows the same principles as in the rest of Canada. There is one exception, however, regarding admission to a master's program. Since Québécois students complete two to three years of [[College education in Quebec|college]] before entering university, they have the opportunity to complete a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Some undergraduate degrees such as the [[Bachelor of Education]] and the [[Bachelor of Engineering]] requires four years of studies. Following the obtention of their bachelor's degree, students can be admitted into a graduate program to eventually obtain a [[master's degree]].

==Chile==

Commonly the Chilean universities have used "Magíster" for a [[master degree]], but other than that is similar to the rest of South America.

==Czech Republic, Slovakia==
Like all EU member states, the Czech Republic and Slovakia follow the Bologna Process. The Czech Republic and Slovakia are using two master's degree systems. Both award a title of ''Mgr.'' or ''Ing.'' to be used before the name.
The older system requires a 5-year program. The new system takes only 2 years but requires a previously completed 3-year bachelor program (a ''Bc.'' title). It is required to write a thesis (in both master and bachelor program) and also to pass final exams. It is mostly the case that the final exams cover the main study areas of the whole study program, i.e. a student is required to prove his/her knowledge in many subjects he attended during the 2 resp. 3 years.

==Egypt==
The Master of Science (M.Sc.) is an academic degree for a post-graduate candidates or researchers, it usually takes from 4 to 7 years after passing the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree. Master programs are awarded in many sciences in the [[Egyptian Universities]]. A completion of the degree requires finishing a [[pre-master]] studies followed by a scientific [[thesis]] or [[research]]. All M.Sc. degree holders are allowable to take a step forward in the academic track to get the [[PhD]] degree.

==Finland==
Like all EU member states, Finland follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree usually follows the Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) studies which typically last five years. For the completion of both the bachelor and the master studies the student must accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Germany==
Like all EU member states, Germany follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (M.Sc.) academic degree replaces the once common ''[[Diplom]]'' or ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' programs that typically lasted four to five years. It is awarded in science related studies with a high percentage of mathematics. For the completion the student must accumulate 300 ECTS Credits, thus most Masters programs are two-year programs with 120 credits. The completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is required.

==Southeastern Europe==
In Slavic countries in European southeast (particularly former [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavian]] republics), the education system was largely based on the German university system (largely due to the presence and influence of the [[Austria-Hungary Empire]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in the region). Prior to the implementation of the [[Bologna Process]], academic university studies comprised a 4-5 year long graduate ''[[Diplom]]'' program, which could have been followed by a 2-4 year long ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister]]'' program and then later with 2-4 year long ''[[Doctoral studies]]''.

After the Bologna Process implementation, again based on the German implementation, ''Diplom'' titles and programs were replaced by the M.Sc. and M.A. programs (depending on the field of study). The studies are structured such that a ''Master'' program lasts long enough for the student to accumulate a total of 300 ECTS credits, so its duration would depend on a number of credits acquired during the Bachelor studies. Pre-Bologna ''Magister'' programs were abandoned - after earning an M.Sc/M.A. degree and satisfying other academic requirements a student could proceed to earn a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] degree directly.

==Guyana==
In Guyana, all universities, including [[University of Guyana]], [[Texila American University]], [[American International School of Medicine]] have Master of Science courses as postgraduate degrees. Students who have completed undergraduate Bachelor of Science degree are eligible to study in this discipline

==Iran==
In Iran, similar to Canada, Master of Science (MSc) or in Iranian form ''[[Karshenasi-arshad]]'' degrees may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or sometimes a mixture. Master's programs typically take two to three years to complete and the completion of a scientific [[thesis]] is often required.

==Ireland==
Like all EU member states, Ireland follows the Bologna Process. In Ireland, Master of Science (MSc) may be course-based with a research component or entirely research based. The program is most commonly a one-year program and a thesis is required for both course-based and research based degrees.

==Israel==
In Israel, Master of Science (MSc) may be entirely course-based or include research. The program is most commonly a two-year program and a thesis is required only for research based degrees.

==India==

In India, universities offer MSc programs usually in science subjects. Generally speaking, in India, post-graduate scientific courses lead to MSc degree while post-graduate engineering courses lead to ME or MTech degree. For example, a master's in automotive engineering would normally be an ME or MTech, while a master's in physics would be an MSc. A few top universities also offer undergraduate programs leading to a master's degree which is known as integrated masters.

A Master of Science in Engineering (M.Sc.Eng.) degree is also offered in India. It is usually structured as an engineering research degree, lesser than [[Ph.D.]] and considered to be parallel to [[M.Phil.]] degree in humanities and science. Some institutes such as [[IITs]] offer an MS degree for postgraduate engineering courses. This degree is considered a research-oriented degree where as MTech or ME degree is usually not a research degree in India. M.S. degree is also awarded by various [[IISER]]s which are one of the top institutes in India.

==Italy==
Like all EU member states, Italy follows the Bologna Process. The degree ''Master of Science'' is awarded in the Italian form, ''[[Laurea Magistrale]]'' (formerly ''Laurea specialistica''; before the introduction of the ''Laurea'' the corresponding degree was ''[[Laurea]] quinquennale'' or ''Vecchio Ordinamento'').

==Nepal==

In Nepal, universities offer the master of science degree usually in science and engineering areas. [[Tribhuvan University]] offers MSc degree for all the science and engineering courses. [[Pokhara University]] offers ME for engineering and MSc for science. [[Kathmandu University]] offers MS by Research and ME degrees for science and engineering.

==Netherlands==
Like all EU member states, the Netherlands follows the Bologna Process. A graduate who is awarded the title Master of Science (abbreviated as MSc) may still use the previously awarded Dutch title ''ingenieur'' (abbreviated as ir.) (for graduates who followed a technical or agricultural program), ''meester'' (abbreviated as mr.) (for graduates who followed an LLM law program) or ''doctorandus'' (abbreviated as drs.)(in all other cases).

==New Zealand==
New Zealand universities commonly have coursework or research-based Master of Science courses for graduate students. They typically run for 2 years full-time, with varying amounts of research involved.

==Norway==
Norway follows the Bologna Process. For engineering, the Master of Science academic degree has been recently introduced and has replaced the previous award forms "[[Sivilingeniør]]" (engineer, a.k.a. engineering master) and "Hovedfag" (academic master). Both were awarded after 5 years university-level studies and required the completion of a scientific thesis.

"Siv.ing", is a protected title exclusively awarded to engineering students who completed a five-year education at The Norwegian University of Science and Technology ({{lang-no|Norges teknisk-naturvitenskapelige universitet}}, NTNU) or other universities.  Historically there was no bachelor's degree involved and today's program is a five years master's degree education. The "Siv.ing" title is in the process of being phased out, replaced by (for now, complemented by) the "M.Sc." title. By and large, "Siv.ing" is a title tightly being held on to for the sake of tradition. In academia, the new program offers separate three-year bachelor and two-year master programs. It is awarded in the natural sciences, mathematics and computer science fields. The completion of a scientific thesis is required. All master's degrees are designed to certify a level of education and qualify for a doctorate program.

Master of Science in Business is the English title for those taking a higher business degree, "Siviløkonom" in Norwegian. In addition, there is, for example, the 'Master of Business Administration' (MBA), a practically oriented master's degree in business, but with less mathematics and econometrics, due to its less specific entry requirements and smaller focus on research.

==Pakistan==
Pakistan inherited its conventions pertaining to higher education from [[United Kingdom]] after [[Partition of India|independence in 1947]]. Master of Science degree is typically abbreviated as M.Sc. (as in the United Kingdom) and which is awarded after 16 years of education (equivalent with a bachelor's degree in the USA and many other countries). Recently, in pursuance to some of the reforms by the [[Higher Education Commission of Pakistan]] (the regulatory body of higher education in Pakistan), the traditional 2-year Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.) degree has been replaced by the 4-year Bachelor of Science degree, which is abbreviated as B.S. to enable the Pakistani degrees with the rest of the world. Subsequently, students who pass 4-year B.S. degree that is awarded after 16 years of education are then eligible to apply for M.S. degree, which is considered at par with Master of Philosophy (M.Phil.) degree.

==Poland==
Like all EU member states, Poland follows the Bologna Process. The Polish equivalent of Master of Science is "magister" (abbreviated "mgr", written pre-nominally much like "Dr"). Starting in 2001, the MSc programs typically lasting 5 years began to be replaced as below:
* 3-year associates programs (termed "licencjat". No abbreviated pre-nominal or title.)
* 3.5-year engineer programs (termed "inżynier", utilizing the pre-nominal abbreviation "inż.")
* 2-year master programs open to both "licencjat" and "inż." graduates.
* 1.5-year master programs open only to "inż." graduates.
The degree is awarded predominantly in the natural sciences, mathematics, computer science, economics, as well as in the arts and other disciplines. Those who graduate from an engineering program prior to being awarded a master's degree are allowed to use the "mgr inż." pre-nominal ("master engineer"). This is most common in engineering and agricultural fields of study. Defense of a research [[thesis]] is required. All master's degrees in Poland qualify for a [[doctorate]] program.

==Russia==
The title of "master" was introduced by Alexander I at 24 January 1803. The Master had an intermediate position between the candidate and doctor according to the decree "About colleges structure". The master's degree was abolished from 1917 to 1934. Russia follows the [[Bologna Process]] for higher education in Europe since 2011.

==Spain==
Like all EU member states, Spain follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science (MSc) degree is a program officially recognized by the [[Ministry of Education (Spain)|Spanish Ministry of Education]]. It usually involves 1 or 2 years of full-time study. It is targeted at pre-experience candidates who have recently finished their undergraduate studies. An MSc degree can be awarded in every field of study. An MSc degree is required in order to progress to a PhD. MSci, MPhil and DEA are equivalent in Spain.

==Sweden==
Like all EU member states, Sweden follows the Bologna Process. The Master of Science academic degree has, like in Germany, recently been introduced in Sweden. Students studying Master of Science in Engineering programs are rewarded both the English Master of Science Degree, but also the Swedish equivalent "Teknologisk masterexamen". Whilst "Civilingenjör" is an at least five year long education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kth.se/utbildning/civilingenjor/datateknik|title=Datateknik, civilingenjör 300 hp  - KTH|author=|date=|website=www.kth.se}}&lt;/ref&gt;   .

==Syria==
The Master of Science is a degree that can be studied only in public universities. The program is usually 2 years, but it can be extended to 3 or 4 years, the student is required to pass a specific bachelor's degree to attend a specific master of science degree program, the master of science is mostly a research master (except for some types of programs held with cooperation of foreign universities), The student should attend some courses in the first year of the master then he/she should prepare a research thesis. Publishing two research papers is recommended and will increase the final evaluation grade.

==United Kingdom==
The Master of Science (MSc) is typically a taught postgraduate degree, involving lectures, examinations and a project dissertation (normally taking up a third of the program). Master's programs usually involve a minimum of 1 year of full-time study (180 UK credits, of which 150 must be at master's level) and sometimes up to 2 years of full-time study (or the equivalent period part-time).&lt;ref name="QAA master's"&gt;{{cite web|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement |publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2977#.WK59n38WI2g|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught master's degrees are normally classified into Pass, Merit and Distinction (although some universities do not give Merit).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/msc_degree_classification/|title=MSc Classification|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some universities also offer MSc by research programs, where a longer project or set of projects is undertaken full-time; master's degrees by research are normally pass/fail, although some universities may offer a distinction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.postgrad.com/advice/masters_programs/masters_degree_grades/|title=Masters Degree Grades|publisher=Postgrad.com|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ox.ac.uk/admissions/graduate/courses/msc-research-mathematics?wssl=1|title=MSc by Research in Mathematics|publisher=[[University of Oxford]]|accessdate=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The more recent Master ''in'' Science (MSci or M.Sci.) degree (Master of Natural Science at the [[University of Cambridge]]), is an undergraduate (UG) level integrated master's degree offered by UK institutions since the 1990s. It is offered as a first degree with the first three (four in Scotland) years similar to a BSc course and a final year (120 UK credits) at master's level, including a dissertation.&lt;ref name="QAA master's"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FHEQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Frameworks for Higher Education Qualifications of UK Degree-Awarding Bodies|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2843#.WK5-J38WI2g|publisher=[[Quality Assurance Agency]]|accessdate=23 February 2017|date=November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final MSci qualification is thus at the same level as a traditional MSc.

==United States==
The ''Master of Science'' (''Magister Scientiæ'') degree is normally a full-time two-year degree often abbreviated "MS" or "M.S." It is the primary type in most subjects and may be entirely course-based, entirely research-based or (more typically) a combination of the two. The combination often involves writing and defending a thesis or completing a research project which represents the culmination of the material learned.

Admission to a master's program is normally contingent upon holding a [[bachelor's degree]] and progressing to a [[doctorate|doctoral]] program may require a master's degree. In some fields or graduate programs, work on a doctorate can begin immediately after the bachelor's degree. Some programs provide for a joint bachelor's and master's degree after about five years. Some universities use the Latin degree names and due to the flexibility of [[Latin grammar|word order in Latin]], ''Artium Magister'' (A.M.) or ''Scientiæ Magister'' (S.M. or Sc.M.) may be used in some institutions.

'''Materials for use in vacuum''' are materials showing very low rate of [[outgassing]] in [[vacuum]], and, where applicable, tolerant to the [[bake-out]] temperatures. The requirements grow increasingly stringent with the desired degree of vacuum achievable in the [[vacuum chamber]].
The materials can produce gas by several mechanisms. Molecules of gases and water can be [[adsorption|adsorbed]] on the material surface (therefore materials with low affinity to water have to be chosen, which eliminates many plastics). Materials may [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] in vacuum (this includes some metals and their alloys, most notably cadmium and zinc). Or the gases can be released from [[porosity|porous]] materials or from cracks and crevices. Traces of lubricants, residues from machining, can be present on the surfaces. A specific risk is outgassing of solvents absorbed in plastics after cleaning.

The gases liberated from the materials not only lower the vacuum quality, but also can be reabsorbed on other surfaces, creating deposits and contaminating the chamber.

Yet another problem is diffusion of gases through the materials themselves. Atmospheric [[helium]] can diffuse even through [[Pyrex]] glass, even if slowly; this however is usually not an issue. Some materials might also expand or increase in size causing problems in delicate equipment.

In addition to the gas-related issues, the materials have to maintain adequate strength through the entire required temperature range (sometimes reaching [[cryogenic]] temperatures), maintain their properties (elasticity, plasticity, electrical and thermal conductivity or lack of it, etc.), be machinable, and if possible not be overly expensive. Yet another concern is the [[thermal expansion coefficient]] match of adjacent parts.

==Materials to avoid==
Materials outgas by three mechanisms: release of [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorbed]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;gases (de[[Sorption|sorption]] from the bulk of the material), release of [[Adsorption|adsorbed]] gases ([[Desorption|desorption]] from the surface only), and evaporation of the material itself. The former can be reduced by a bakeout, the latter is an intrinsic property of the material.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"&gt;{{cite book|title=Vacuum Physics and Technology|author=Meurant, G.|date=1980|publisher=[[Elsevier Science]]|isbn=9780080859958|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tfLWfAx1ZWQC&amp;pg=PA346|page=346|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some outgassed materials can deposit on other surfaces, contaminate the vacuum system and be difficult to get rid of.

The most common sources of trouble (out-gassing) in vacuum systems are:
* [[Cadmium]], often present in the form of [[cadmium plating]], or in some [[soldering]] and [[brazing]] alloys
* [[Zinc]], problematic for high vacuum and higher temperatures, present in some construction alloys, e.g. [[brass]] and some brazing alloys. Tends to poison [[hot cathode]]s and form conductive deposits on surfaces.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;  Any materials that have been zinc-coated by [[galvanization]] should be avoided, or they have the coating removed first.
* [[Magnesium]]
* [[PVC]], usually in the form of [[wire]] insulation (source of virtual leaks too)
* [[Paint]]s
* [[Lead]] and [[antimony]] used in some soft [[solder]]s and outgassing at higher temperatures&lt;ref name="fermi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lss.fnal.gov/archive/tm/TM-1615.pdf|publisher=[[Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory]]|title= TM-1615: Materials for Ultra-High Vacuum|author= G. Lee | date=August 15, 1989 |accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Many [[plastics]], namely many plastic tapes (special attention should be paid to adhesives). Fiberglass composites, e.g. [[Micarta]] (G-10) and G-30, should be avoided. Even [[Kapton]] and [[Teflon]] are sometimes advised against.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* Various residues, e.g. [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] from soldering and brazing, and lubricants from machining making thorough cleaning imperative. Getting the outgassable residues from tight crevices can be challenging; a good mechanical design that avoids such features can help.

==Materials for vacuum use==

===Metals===
* [[Austenitic stainless steel]]s are the most common choice for [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] and [[ultra-high vacuum]] systems. Not all alloys are suitable; e.g. the free-machining 303 steel contains [[sulfur]], which tends to outgas. Alloys with good weldability under argon [[arc welding]] are usually chosen.
** '''304 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' is a common choice of a stainless steel.
** '''304L [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''', a low-carbon variant of 304 steel, is used for ultra-high vacuum systems.
** '''316L [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' a low-carbon and low-magnetic stainless steel, used in accelerator technologies.
** '''347 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' does not accept high polish.
** '''321 [[Stainless steel#Comparison of standardized steels|stainless steel]]''' is chosen when low [[magnetic permeability]] is needed.
* [[Mild steel]] can be used for moderate vacuums above 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; torr. Outgassing can be lowered with suitable (e.g. nickel) [[plating]]. It has high permeability to hydrogen and tendency to rust. For use it should be thoroughly outgassed in vacuum.
* [[Aluminium]] and [[aluminium alloys]] are another class of frequently used materials. They are well-machinable and have low outgassing, unless the alloys contain higher proportions of [[zinc]]. The parts must not be [[anodized]], as the oxide layer traps (and outgases) water vapor. Anodizing also makes the surface non-conducting, so that its surface will charge up in [[electrostatic system]]s. The best treatment is Alochroming, which seals the surface, makes it hard and conductive. Its outgassing rate is considerably less than non-treated aluminium. Aluminium and its alloys have low strength at high temperatures, distort when being welded, and the copper-containing ones are poorly weldable. Aluminium wire rings can be used as cheap gaskets in demountable seals. Aluminium has high thermal conductivity, good corrosion resistance, and low solubility of hydrogen. Loss of strength at high temperatures limits its use in bakeable applications, but aluminium is advantageous for large-size systems due to its lower weight and lower cost than stainless steel. Use of aluminium is limited by difficulties in its welding and brazing. It can be used for x-ray windows.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* [[Aluminium bronze]] is a material that looks and machines similar to [[brass]]. It is not susceptible to [[galling]], which makes it suitable for sliding fits against stainless steel.
* [[Nickel]] is widely used in vacuum technology, e.g. as mechanical parts in [[vacuum tube]]s. It is relatively low-cost, can be spot welded, can be easily machined, has high melting point and is resistant to many corrosive fluids and atmospheres. Its potential drawback is its [[ferromagnetism]], which restricts applications that would be influenced by magnetic fields.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* Nickel alloys, e.g. [[cupronickel]]&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Beryllium]] is used primarily for x-ray windows.
* [[Oxygen-free copper]] is widely used. It is easily machined and has good corrosion resistance. It is unsuitable for bakeable vacuum envelopes due to its tendency to oxidize and create scales. Copper rings are used in demountable seals. Normal [[copper]] is unsuitable for high vacuum as it is difficult to outgas completely. Copper is insensitive to hydrogen and impermeable to hydrogen and helium, has low sensitivity to water vapor, but is attacked by mercury. Its strength falls sharply above 200&amp;nbsp;°C. Its vapor pressure becomes significant at above 500&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="vacphytec"/&gt;
* [[Brass]] is suitable for some applications. It has good corrosion resistance. Its zinc content may cause problems; zinc outgassing can be reduced by nickel-plating.
* [[Indium]] wire is used as a gasket in demountable seals.
* [[Gold]] wire is used as a gasket in demountable seals for ultra-high vacuum, as well as an alternative to lead-tin solder for making electrical connections.
* [[Platinum]] is a highly chemically inert material with high cost and low outgassing.
* [[Zirconium]] is corrosion-resistant. It has low production of [[secondary electrons]], so it is used as a coating of areas where reducing their production is important. It is used for [[neutron]] windows. It is costly and scarce, its uses are therefore limited. Zirconium and zirconium hydride are used for [[gettering]].
* [[Tungsten]] is often used in high temperature applications as well as for filaments in electron/ion optics. It becomes brittle from [[work hardening]] when mechanically deformed, or subjected to very high temperatures.
* [[Molybdenum]] and [[tantalum]] are useful for high temperature applications.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Titanium]] and [[niobium]] are good materials.
* [[Solder]]s are sometimes unavoidable for soft-soldered joints. Tin-lead solders (Sn50Pb50, Sn60Pb40, Sn63Pb37) can be conditionally used when the apparatus is not to be baked and operating temperatures aren't elevated (lead tends to outgas). A better choice for vacuum systems is the tin-silver eutectic, Sn95Ag5; its melting point of 230&amp;nbsp;°C allows bakeout up to 200&amp;nbsp;°C. A similar 95-5 alloy, Sn95Sb5, is unsuitable as antimony has similar vapor pressure as lead. Take care to remove [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] residues.
* [[List of brazing alloys|Brazing alloys]] are used for joining materials by [[brazing]]. Care has to be taken while choosing the alloys, as some elements tend to outgas. Cadmium and zinc are the worst common offenders. Silver, a common component of brazing alloys, can be problematic at higher temperatures and lower pressures. A silver-copper eutectic, named e.g. Cusil, is recommended. A superior alternative is a copper-silver-tin alloy called Cusiltin. Copper-silver-phosphorus alloys, e.g. Sil-Fos, are also suitable.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;

===Plastics===
* Some [[fluoropolymer]]s, e.g. [[polyvinylidene fluoride]], are suitable for use in vacuum. They have low outgassing and are tolerant to higher temperatures.
** [[Polytetrafluoroethylene]] ([[PTFE]] or Teflon) is commonly used inside of vacuum systems. It is self-lubricating, a good electrical insulator, tolerant to fairly high temperatures, and has low out-gassing. It is not suitable for barrier between vacuum and atmosphere, as it is somewhat permeable for gases. Ceramics is a superior choice, however.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* [[Polyethylene]] is usable but requires thorough out-gassing. [[Nalgene]] can be used as a cheaper alternative for [[Bell jar]]s.
* [[Vespel]] [[polyimide]] is very expensive, but machines well, has good electrical insulator properties and is compatible with ultra-high vacuum.
* [[PVC]], despite its high outgassing rate, can be used in limited applications for rough vacuum lines.
* [[Nylon]] is self-lubricating but has high outgassing rate and high affinity to water.
* [[Acrylate polymer|Acrylics]] have high outgassing rate and high affinity to water.
* [[Polycarbonate]]s and [[polystyrene]] are good electrical insulators with moderate outgassing.
* [[PEEK]] (PolyEtherEtherKetone) has relatively low out-gassing values (0.31% TML, 0.00% CVCM, 0.06% WVR).
* [[Kapton]] is a type of polyimide film, has very low outgassing. Kapton is discouraged if a ceramic alternative can be used.&lt;ref name="fermi"/&gt;
* Some [[elastomer]]s have sufficient vacuum properties to be employed in vacuum o-rings:
** [[Nitrile rubber|NBRs]], ([[Nitrile rubber]]), commonly used for demountable vacuum seals (bakeable only up to 100&amp;nbsp;°C).
** [[FKM|FKMs (FPMs)]], ([[Viton]]) is used for demountable vacuum seals. It is better for lower pressures than [[nitrile rubber]] and chemically much more [[Chemically inert|inert]]. It is bakeable to 200&amp;nbsp;°C.
** [[FFKM]]s ([[FFPM]]s) very low out-gassing similar to Teflon and withstands baking temperatures up to 300&amp;nbsp;°C, while chemically one of the most [[Chemically inert|inert]] sealing elastomers.

===Glasses and ceramics===
* [[Borosilicate glass]] is often used for smaller assemblies and for viewports. It can be machined and joined well. Glasses can be [[glass-to-metal seal|joined with metals]].
* [[Porcelain]] and [[alumina]] ceramics, when fully [[vitrified]] and therefore non-porous, are excellent insulators usable up to 1500&amp;nbsp;°C. Some ceramics can be machined. Ceramics can be [[ceramics-to-metal seal|joined with metals]].
* [[Macor]] is a machinable ceramic that is an excellent alternative to alumina, as the firing process of alumina can change the dimensions and tolerances.

===Lubricants===
Lubrication of moving parts is a problem for vacuum. Many [[lubricant]]s have unacceptable outgassing rates,&lt;ref name="Carre, Bertrand, 1999" &gt;{{Cite journal
  |title=Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope Reaction Wheel Lubricant

  |pages=109–113
|bibcode=1999JSpRo..36..109C}}&lt;/ref&gt; others (e.g. [[graphite]]) lose lubricating properties.
* [[Vacuum grease]]s are [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]]s with low outgassing.
** [[Ramsay grease]] is an old composition of paraffin wax, vaseline and natural rubber, usable up to about 25&amp;nbsp;°C, for low vacuums to about 1 Pa.
** [[Krytox]] is a fluorether-based vacuum grease, useful from -75 to over 350&amp;nbsp;°C, not flammable even in [[liquid oxygen]], and highly resistant to [[ionizing radiation]].
** [[Polyphenyl ether]] greases
** [[Torrlube]], a brand encompassing a range of lubricating oils based on [[perfluoropolyether]]s.&lt;ref name="torrlube"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torrlube.com/|title=TorrLube.com &amp;#124; The Unrivaled Leader in High Vacuum Lubrication|publisher=torrlube.com|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Dry lubricant]]s, can be incorporated in plastics as fillers, as a component of sintered metals, or deposited on metal, ceramic and plastic surfaces.
** [[Molybdenum disulfide]] is a dry lubricant usable in vacuum.
** [[Tungsten disulfide]] is another dry lubricant usable in vacuum. It can be used at higher temperatures than MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Tungsten disulfide used to be significantly more expensive, but rise of prices of molybdenum disulfide brought them to a comparable range.&lt;ref name="lowerfriction"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lowerfriction.com/pdf/8.pdf|date=2 December 2008|title=Comparison between Molybdenum Disulfide &amp; Tungsten Disulfide|author=Ketan|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usable from -188 to +1316&amp;nbsp;°C in vacuum, from -273 to +650&amp;nbsp;°C in normal atmosphere.&lt;ref name="appliedtungstenite"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appliedtungstenite.com/html/aerospace.html|title=Applied Tungstenite: Aerospace: Tungsten Disulfide WS2 dry film Lubricant and Citric Acid Passivation|publisher=appliedtungstenite.com|accessdate=2015-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Boron nitride#Hexagonal BN|Hexagonal boron nitride]] is a graphite-like dry lubricant used in space vehicles.

===Adhesives===
* Torr-Seal, or its generic equivalent Hysol-1C (USA brand name) or Loctite 9492 (EU brand name), is an epoxy with resin and hardener for use in vacuum environments. It will begin to degrade at high temperatures but otherwise is very stable with very little outgassing. Other vacuum-rated epoxies are also available. For mounting or joining thin metal foils, grids, or other small pieces that are not expected to undergo stress, silver or gold paste may be used as an adhesive. After fixing the material(s) with silver paste, the piece must be   baked (to &gt; 200 C) in air for &gt; 24 hours to remove volatiles prior to insertion into vacuum. 

==Materials for use in space==
In addition to the concerns above, materials for use in [[spacecraft]] applications have to cope with [[radiation damage]] and high-intensity [[ultraviolet radiation]], thermal loads from solar radiation, radiation cooling of the vehicle in other directions, and heat produced within the spacecraft's systems. Another concern, for orbits closer to Earth, is the presence of [[atomic oxygen]], leading to [[corrosion in space|corrosion]] of exposed surfaces; aluminium is an especially sensitive material{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}. Silver, often used for surface-deposited interconnects, forms layer of silver oxide that flakes off and may erode up to a total failure.

Corrosion-sensitive surfaces can be protected by a suitable [[plating]], most often with [[gold]]; a [[silica]] layer is also possible. However the coating layer is subject to erosion by [[micrometeoroids]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1807">'''Metabolite pool''' is a collective term for all of the substances involved in the [[Metabolism|metabolic]] process in a [[biological system]].
Metabolic pools are within cells (or [[Organelle|organelles]] such as [[Chloroplast|chloroplasts]]) and refer to the reservoir of [[Molecule|molecules]] upon which [[enzyme]]s can operate. The size of the reservoir is referred to as its "metabolic pool." The metabolic pool concept is important to [[Cellular Biology|cellular biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://w3.marietta.edu/~spilatrs/biol103/photolab/metapool.html|title= Photosynthesis Investigation Study Guide|last= Spilatro|first= Steven|date= 1998|website= Photosynthesis Investigation Study Guide|publisher= Marietta College|access-date= 22 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In certain ways, a [[metabolic pathway]] is similar to a factory assembly line. Products are assembled from parts by workers who each perform a specific step in the manufacturing process. Enzymes of a cell are like workers on an assembly line; each is only responsible for a particular step in the assembly process. A lag period also occurs when a new factory is constructed, a time period before finished products begin to roll off the assembly line at a steady rate. This lag period partially results from the time needed to fill supply bins with the necessary parts. As you might imagine, when parts are not readily available, production slows or stops. Metabolite pools are somewhat analogous to the parts bins of a factory. The [[Calvin Cycle|Calvin-Benson]] cycle will only operate at full speed when the cellular 'bins' are full of the molecular building blocks that lie between [[3-Phosphoglyceric acid|PGA]] and [[Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate|RUBP]].

The '''Modulor''' is an [[anthropometric]] [[scale (ratio)|scale]] of [[Proportion (architecture)|proportion]]s devised by the [[List of Swiss people|Swiss-born]] [[List of French people|French]] [[architect]] [[Le Corbusier]] (1887–1965).

It was developed as a visual bridge between two incompatible scales, the [[Imperial units|imperial]] and the [[metric system]]. It is based on the height of a man with his arm raised.

It was used as a system to set out a number of Le Corbusier's buildings and was later codified into two books.

==History==
Le Corbusier developed the Modulor in the long tradition of [[Vitruvius]], [[Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci's]] [[Vitruvian Man]], the work of [[Leon Battista Alberti]], and other attempts to discover mathematical proportions in the human body and then to use that knowledge to improve both the appearance and function of [[architecture]].{{sfnp|Ostwald|2001|p=146}}  The system is based on [[anthropometry|human measurements]], the double unit, the [[Fibonacci numbers]], and the [[golden ratio]].  Le Corbusier described it as a "range of harmonious measurements to suit the human scale, universally applicable to architecture and to mechanical things".

With the Modulor, Le Corbusier sought to introduce a scale of visual measures that would unite two virtually incompatible systems: the [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo Saxon]] [[Foot (length)|foot]] and [[inch]] and the French metric system.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=17}} Whilst he was intrigued by ancient civilisations who used measuring systems linked to the human body: elbow ([[cubit]]), finger ([[Digit (length)|digit]]), thumb (inch) etc., he was troubled by the [[metre]] as a measure that was a forty-millionth part of the meridian of the earth.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=20}}

In 1943, in response to the French National Organisation for Standardisation's ([[AFNOR]]) requirement for standardising all the objects involved in the construction process, Le Corbusier asked an apprentice to consider a scale based upon a man with his arm raised to 2.20&amp;nbsp;m in height.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=36}} The result, in August 1943 was the first graphical representation of the derivation of the scale. This was refined after a visit to the Dean of the Faculty of Sciences in Sorbonne on 7 February 1945 which resulted in the inclusion of a golden section into the representation.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=43}}

Whilst initially the Modulor Man's height was based on a French man's height of {{convert|1.75|m|ftin}} it was changed to 1.83&amp;nbsp;m in 1946 because "in English detective novels, the good-looking men, such as policemen, are always six feet tall!"{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=56}} The dimensions were refined to give round numbers and the overall height of the raised arm was set at 2.262&amp;nbsp;m.

Of the works leading to the creation of the Modulor, Robin Evans notes that the female body "was only belatedly considered and rejected as a source of proportional harmony".{{sfnp|Ostwald|2001|p=146}}

==Promotion==
On the 10 January 1946, Le Corbusier on a visit to New York met with [[Henry J. Kaiser]], an American industrialist whose [[Kaiser Shipyard]] had built [[Liberty ship|Liberty Ships]] during [[World War II]]. Kaiser's project was to build ten thousand new houses a day, but he had changed his mind and decided to build cars instead.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=52}} During the interview, Le Corbusier sympathised with Kaiser's problems of coordinating the adoption of equipment between the American and British armies because of the differences in units of length and promoted his own ''harmonious scale''.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=115}}

On the same trip he met with [[David E. Lilienthal]] of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] to promote the use of his ''harmonious scale'' on further civil engineering projects.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=53}}

He also applied the principle of the Modulor to the efficient design of distribution crates in post war France.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=122}}

==Graphic representation==
The graphic representation of the Modulor, a stylised human figure with one arm raised, stands next to two vertical measurements, a red series based on the figure's navel height (1.08&amp;nbsp;m in the original version, 1.13&amp;nbsp;m in the revised version) then segmented according to [[Phi]], and a blue series based on the figure's entire height, double the navel height (2.16&amp;nbsp;m in the original version, 2.26&amp;nbsp;m in the revised), segmented similarly.  A [[spiral]], graphically developed between the red and blue segments, seems to mimic the volume of the human figure.

The Modulor 2 was drawn by [[André Maissonier]] and [[Justino Serralta]].&lt;ref&gt;Jorge Nudelman, [http://www.farq.edu.uy/patio/institucion/en-recuerdo.html "En recuerdo: Justino Serralta, 'arquitecto de comunidades', 1919–2011"], ''Boletín Facultad de Arquitectura UDELAR'' (30 October 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical application==
Le Corbusier used his Modulor scale in the design of many [[Le Corbusier#Key buildings|buildings]], including:

===Unité d'Habitation à Marseille===

In his first book on the subject ''The Modulor'', Le Corbusier has a chapter on the use of the modular in the [[Unité d'Habitation]]. The modular governs: the plan, section and elevations; the [[Brise soleil|brise-soleil]]; the roof; the supporting columns and the plan and section of the apartments. It was also used for the dimensions of the commemorative stone laid on 14 October 1947.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=131}} A version of the Modulor Man was [[casting|cast]] in [[concrete]] near the entrance.

===Church of Sainte Marie de La Tourette===

In the Church of [[Sainte Marie de La Tourette]] Le Corbusier floors the majority of the church in pale concrete panels set to Modulor dimensions.{{sfnp|Samuel|2007|p=62}} Also, the engineer [[Iannis Xenakis]] applied the Modulor system to the design of the exterior vertical ventilators or "ondulatoires".{{sfnp|Samuel|2007|p=83}}

===Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts===

In the [[Carpenter Center for the Visual Arts|Carpenter Center]] the Modulor system was used for the brise-soleil distances, the floor to floor heights, the bay distances and the column thicknesses.{{sfnp|Sekler|Curtis|1978|p=158}} Le Corbusier conceived that the dimensioning of the entrance ramp would be "''visible essay on the mathematics of the human body''".{{sfnp|Sekler|Curtis|1978|p=182}}

==Publication==
Le Corbusier published ''Le Modulor'' in 1948, followed by ''Modulor 2'' in 1955.  These works were first published in English as ''The Modulor'' in 1954 and ''Modulor 2 (Let the User Speak Next)'' in 1958.

The 2004 reprinted box set including both books was printed in a square format using the Modulor with the series twenty seven to one hundred and forty reduced in size to one tenth.{{sfnp|Le Corbusier|2004|p=back cover}}

[[File:Praezession.svg|thumb|170px|{{colorbox|green}} Rotation, {{colorbox|blue}} precession, and {{colorbox|red}} nutation in obliquity of a planet]]

'''Nutation''' (from [[Latin]] ''nūtātiō'', "nodding, swaying") is a rocking, swaying, or nodding motion in the [[axis of rotation]] of a largely axially symmetric object, such as a [[gyroscope]], [[planet]], or [[bullet]] [[external ballistics|in flight]], or as an intended behaviour of a mechanism. In an appropriate [[frame of reference|reference frame]] it can be defined as a change in the second [[Euler angles#Euler rotations|Euler angle]]. If it is not caused by forces external to the body, it is called ''free nutation'' or ''[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] nutation''.&lt;ref name=Lowrie/&gt; A ''pure nutation'' is a movement of a rotational axis such that the first Euler angle is constant.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In spacecraft dynamics, [[precession]] (a change in the first Euler angle) is sometimes referred to as nutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kasdin|first=N. Jeremy|title=Engineering dynamics : a comprehensive introduction|date=2010|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|location=Princeton, N.J.|isbn=9780691135373|pages=526–527|author2=Paley, Derek A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rigid body==
{{further|rigid body dynamics}}
If a [[top]] is set at a tilt on a horizontal surface and spun rapidly, its rotational axis starts precessing about the vertical. After a short interval, the top settles into a motion in which each point on its rotation axis follows a circular path. The vertical force of gravity produces a horizontal torque {{math|'''&amp;tau;'''}} about the point of contact with the surface; the top rotates in the direction of this torque with an angular velocity {{math|'''&amp;Omega;'''}} such that at any moment
:&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{\tau} = \mathbf{\Omega} \times \mathbf{L},&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|'''L'''}} is the instantaneous angular momentum of the top.&lt;ref name=Feynman&gt;{{harvnb|Feynman|Leighton|Sands|2011|pp=20–7{{clarify|date=December 2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, however, there is no precession, and the top falls straight downward. This gives rise to an imbalance in torques that starts the precession. In falling, the top overshoots the level at which it would precess steadily and then oscillates about this level. This oscillation is called ''nutation''. If the motion is damped, the oscillations will die down until the motion is a steady precession.&lt;ref name=Feynman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Goldstein220&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physics of nutation in tops and [[gyroscope]]s can be explored using the model of a ''heavy symmetrical top'' with its tip fixed. Initially, the effect of friction is ignored. The motion of the top can be described by three [[Euler angles]]: the tilt angle {{math|''&amp;theta;''}} between the symmetry axis of the top and the vertical; the [[azimuth]] {{math|''&amp;phi;''}} of the top about the vertical; and the rotation angle {{math|''&amp;psi;''}} of the top about its own axis. Thus, precession is the change in {{math|''&amp;phi;''}} and nutation is the change in {{math|''&amp;theta;''}}.&lt;ref name=Goldstein217&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|p=217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the top has mass {{math|''M''}} and its [[center of mass]] is at a distance {{math|''l''}} from the pivot point, its [[gravitational potential]] relative to the plane of the support is
:&lt;math&gt;V = Mgl\cos(\theta).&lt;/math&gt;

In a coordinate system where the {{math|''z''}} axis is the axis of symmetry, the top has [[angular velocity|angular velocities]] {{math|''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''&amp;omega;''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} and [[moments of inertia]] {{math|''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}} about the {{math|''x'', ''y''}}, and {{math|''z''}} axes. The [[kinetic energy]] is
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{r} = \frac{1}{2}I_1\left(\omega_1^2 + \omega_2^2\right) + \frac{1}{2}I_3\omega_3^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In terms of the Euler angles, this is
:&lt;math&gt;E_\text{r} = \frac{1}{2}I_1\left(\dot{\theta}^2 + \dot{\phi}^2\sin^2(\theta)\right) + \frac{1}{2}I_3\left(\dot{\psi} + \dot{\phi}\cos(\theta)\right)^2.&lt;/math&gt;

If the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Euler–Lagrange equations]] are solved for this system, it is found that the motion depends on two constants {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} (each related to a [[constant of motion]]). The rate of precession is related to the tilt by
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\phi} = \frac{b - a\cos(\theta)}{\sin^2(\theta)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The tilt is determined by a differential equation for {{math|''u'' {{=}} cos(''&amp;theta;'')}} of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{u}^2 = f(u)&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''f''}} is a [[cubic function|cubic polynomial]] that depends on parameters {{math|''a''}} and {{math|''b''}} as well as constants that are related to the energy and the gravitational torque. The roots of {{math|''f''}} are [[cosine]]s of the angles at which the [[time derivative|rate of change]] of {{math|''&amp;theta;''}} is zero. One of these is not related to a physical angle; the other two determine the upper and lower bounds on the tilt angle, between which the gyroscope oscillates.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goldstein|1980|pp=213–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Astronomy==
{{main|Astronomical nutation}}
The nutation of a planet happens because of gravitational attraction of other bodies that cause the [[precession of the equinoxes]] to vary over time so that the speed of precession is not constant. The nutation of the [[Earth's rotation|axis of the Earth]] was discovered in 1728 by the English astronomer [[James Bradley]].

==Earth==
{{further|geodynamics}}
[[File:Trópico de Cáncer en México - Carretera 83 (Vía Corta) Zaragoza-Victoria, Km 27+800.jpg|thumb|240px|Yearly changes in the location of the [[Tropic of Cancer]] near a highway in Mexico]]

Nutation makes a small change to the angle at which the Earth tilts with respect to the Sun, changing the location of the [[Circle of latitude#Major circles of latitude|major circles of latitude]] that are defined by the Earth's tilt (the [[tropical circle]]s and the [[polar circle]]s).

In the case of the Earth, the principal sources of tidal force are the [[Sun]] and [[Moon]], which continuously change location relative to each other and thus cause nutation in Earth's axis. The largest component of Earth's nutation has a period of 18.6 years, the same as that of the precession of the [[Lunar node|Moon's orbital nodes]].&lt;ref name=Lowrie&gt;{{cite book|last=Lowrie|first=William|title=Fundamentals of geophysics|date=2007|publisher=[[Cambridge Univ. Press]]|location=Cambridge [u.a.]|isbn=9780521675963|pages=58–59|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are other significant periodic terms that must be accounted for depending upon the desired accuracy of the result. A mathematical description (set of equations) that represents nutation is called a "theory of nutation". In the theory, parameters are adjusted in a more or less ''ad hoc'' method to obtain the best fit to data. Simple [[rigid body dynamics]] do not give the best theory; one has to account for deformations of the Earth, including [[asthenosphere|mantle inelasticity]] and changes in the [[core–mantle boundary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iers.org/nn_10382/IERS/EN/Science/Recommendations/resolutionB3.html |title=Resolution 83 on non-rigid Earth nutation theory |work=[[International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service]] |publisher=Federal Agency for Cartography and Geodesy |date=2 April 2009 |accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal term of nutation is due to the regression of the Moon's [[nodal line]] and has the same period of 6798 days (18.61 years). It reaches plus or minus 17&amp;Prime; in [[longitude]] and 9.2&amp;Prime; in [[Axial tilt|obliquity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www2.jpl.nasa.gov/basics/bsf2-1.php#nutation|title = Basics of Space Flight, Chapter 2|date = 2013-10-29|accessdate = 2015-03-26|website = Jet Propulsion Laboratory|publisher = Jet Propulsion Laboratory/NASA|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; All other terms are much smaller; the next-largest, with a period of 183 days (0.5 year), has amplitudes 1.3&amp;Prime; and 0.6&amp;Prime; respectively. The periods of all terms larger than 0.0001&amp;Prime; (about as accurately as one{{who|date=May 2018}} can measure) lie between 5.5 and 6798 days; for some reason (as with ocean tidal periods) they seem to avoid the range from 34.8 to 91 days, so it is customary to split the nutation into long-period and short-period terms. The long-period terms are calculated and mentioned in the almanacs, while the additional correction due to the short-period terms is usually taken from a table.

==In popular culture==
In the 1961 movie ''[[The Day the Earth Caught Fire]]'', the near-simultaneous detonation of two super-hydrogen bombs near the poles causes a change in the Earth's nutation, as well as an 11 degree shift in the axis of rotation and a change in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.

'''Physically based rendering''' or '''PBR''' is a [[shader|shading model]] in [[computer graphics]] that seeks to [[3D rendering|render]] graphics in a way that more accurately models the [[optics|flow of light]] in the real world.  Many PBR pipelines (though not all) have the accurate simulation of [[photorealism]] as their goal, often in [[real time computing]].  [[Photogrammetry]] may be used to help discover and encode accurate optical properties of materials.

==History==

Starting in the 1980s, a number of rendering researchers worked on establishing a solid theoretical basis for rendering, including physical correctness. Much of this work was done at the [[Cornell University]] Program of Computer Graphics; a 1997 paper from that lab&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg, Donald P., Torrance, Kenneth E., Shirley, Peter, Arvo, James, Ferwerda, James A., Pattanaik, Suumanta, Lafortune, Eric, Walter, Bruce, Foo, Sing-Choong, and Trumbore, Ben [http://www.graphics.cornell.edu/pubs/1997/GTS+97.pdf "A Framework for Realistic Image Synthesis". Retrieved on 27 November 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; describes the work done at Cornell in this area to that point.

The phrase was more widely popularized by [[Matt Pharr]], Greg Humphreys, and Pat Hanrahan in their book of the same name from 2004, a seminal work in modern computer graphics that won its authors a Technical Achievement [[Academy Award]] for [[special effects]].&lt;ref&gt;Pharr, Matt, Humphreys, Greg, and Hanrahan, Pat.

==Process==

As described by researcher Jeff Russell of Marmoset, a physically based rendering pipeline may focus on the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Jeff, [https://www.marmoset.co/toolbag/learn/pbr-theory "PBR Theory"]. Retrieved on 14 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Reflection (computer graphics)|Reflection]]
* [[Diffusion]]
* [[Translucency|Translucency and transparency]]
* [[Conservation of energy]]
* [[Metallic color|Metallicity]]
* [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel|Fresnel]] reflectivity
* [[Microsurface]] scattering

PBR is, as Joe Wilson puts it, "more of a concept than a strict set of rules"&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Joe. [https://www.marmoset.co/posts/physically-based-rendering-and-you-can-too/ "Physically Based Rendering – And You Can Too!"] Retrieved on 12 Jan 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; – but the concept contains several distinctive points of note.   One of these is that – unlike many previous models that sought to differentiate surfaces between non-reflective and reflective – PBR recognizes that, in the real world, as John Hable puts it, "everything is shiny".&lt;ref&gt;Hable, John . [http://filmicgames.com/archives/547 "Everything Is Shiny"].  Retrieved on 14 November 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;  Even "flat" or "matte" surfaces in the real world such as [[rubber]] will reflect a small degree of light, and many [[metal]]s and [[liquid]]s will reflect a great deal of it.  Another thing that PBR models attempt to do is to integrate [[photogrammetry]] - measurements from photographs of real-world materials - to study and replicate real physical ranges of values to accurately simulate [[albedo]], [[gloss (optics)|gloss]], [[reflectivity]], and other physical properties.  Finally, PBR puts a great deal of emphasis on [[microsurface]]s, and will often contain additional textures and mathematical models intended to model small-scale [[specular highlights]] and cavities resulting from smoothness or roughness in addition to traditional specular or reflectivity maps.

== State of the art ==
A typical application provides an intuitive [[graphical user interface]] that allows artists to define and layer materials with arbitrary properties and to assign them to a given 2D or 3D object to recreate the appearance of any synthetic or organic material. Environments can be defined with procedural shaders or textures as well as procedural geometry or meshes or pointclouds&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://help.sketchfab.com/hc/en-us/articles/209143806-Point-Clouds|title=Point Clouds|last=|first=|date=|website=Sketchfab Help Center|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;. If possible all changes are made visible in real-time and therefore allow for quick iterations. Sophisticated applications allow savvy users to write custom shaders in a [[shading language]].

'''Possibility theory''' is a mathematical theory for dealing with certain types of [[uncertainty]] and is an alternative to [[probability theory]]. Professor [[Lotfi Zadeh]] first introduced possibility theory in 1978 as an extension of his theory of [[fuzzy sets]] and [[fuzzy logic]]. [[Didier Dubois (mathematician)|Didier Dubois]] and Henri Prade further contributed to its development. Earlier in the 1950s, economist [[G. L. S. Shackle]] proposed the [[min/max algebra]] to describe degrees of potential surprise.

==Formalization of possibility==
For simplicity, assume that the [[universe of discourse]] Ω is a finite set. A possibility measure is a function &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;2^\Omega&lt;/math&gt; to [0,&amp;nbsp;1] such that:

:Axiom 1: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(\varnothing) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

:Axiom 2: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(\Omega) = 1&lt;/math&gt;

:Axiom 3: &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U \cup V) = \max \left( \operatorname{pos}(U), \operatorname{pos}(V) \right)&lt;/math&gt; for any disjoint subsets &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows that, like probability, the possibility measure is determined by its behavior on singletons:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = \max_{\omega \in U} \operatorname{pos}(\{\omega\})&lt;/math&gt;

provided that ''U'' is finite or countably infinite.

Axiom 1 can be interpreted as the assumption that Ω is an exhaustive description of future states of the world, because it means that no belief weight is given to elements outside Ω.

Axiom 2 could be interpreted as the assumption that the evidence from which &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}&lt;/math&gt; was constructed is free of any contradiction. Technically, it implies that there is at least one element in Ω with possibility 1.

Axiom 3 corresponds to the additivity axiom in probabilities. However there is an important practical difference. Possibility theory is computationally more convenient because Axioms 1–3 imply that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U \cup V) = \max \left( \operatorname{pos}(U), \operatorname{pos}(V) \right)&lt;/math&gt; for ''any'' subsets &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;.

Because one can know the possibility of the union from the possibility of each component, it can be said that possibility is [[Principle of compositionality|''compositional'']] with respect to the union operator. Note however that it is not compositional with respect to the intersection operator. Generally:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U \cap V) \leq \min \left( \operatorname{pos}(U), \operatorname{pos}(V) \right).&lt;/math&gt;

When Ω is not finite, Axiom 3 can be replaced by:

:For all index sets &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, if the subsets &lt;math&gt;U_{i,\, i \in I}&lt;/math&gt; are pairwise disjoint, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}\left(\cup_{i \in I} U_i\right) = \sup_{i \in I}\operatorname{pos}(U_i).&lt;/math&gt;

==Necessity==

Whereas [[probability theory]] uses a single number, the probability, to describe how likely an event is to occur, possibility theory uses two concepts, the ''possibility'' and the ''necessity ''of the event. For any set &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, the necessity measure is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 1 - \operatorname{pos}(\overline U)&lt;/math&gt;

In the above formula, &lt;math&gt;\overline U&lt;/math&gt; denotes the complement of &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, that is the elements of &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; that do not belong to &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to show that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) \leq \operatorname{pos}(U)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;

and that:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U \cap V) = \min ( \operatorname{nec}(U), \operatorname{nec}(V))&lt;/math&gt;

Note that contrary to probability theory, possibility is not self-dual. That is, for any event &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, we only have the inequality:

:&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) + \operatorname{pos}(\overline U) \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;

However, the following duality rule holds:

:For any event &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;, either &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Accordingly, beliefs about an event can be represented by a number and a bit.

==Interpretation==
There are four cases that can be interpreted as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is necessary. &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is certainly true. It implies that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is impossible. &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is certainly false. It implies that &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is possible. I would not be surprised at all if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; occurs. It leaves &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U)&lt;/math&gt; unconstrained.

&lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt; means that &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; is unnecessary. I would not be surprised at all if &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; does not occur. It leaves &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U)&lt;/math&gt; unconstrained.

The intersection of the last two cases is &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{nec}(U) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{pos}(U) = 1&lt;/math&gt; meaning that I believe nothing at all about &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt;. Because it allows for indeterminacy like this, possibility theory relates to the graduation of a many-valued logic, such as [[intuitionistic logic]], rather than the classical two-valued logic.

Note that unlike possibility, fuzzy logic is compositional with respect to both the union and the intersection operator. The relationship with fuzzy theory can be explained with the following classical example.

* Fuzzy logic: When a bottle is half full, it can be said that the level of truth of the proposition "The bottle is full" is 0.5. The word "full" is seen as a fuzzy predicate describing the amount of liquid in the bottle.
* Possibility theory: There is one bottle, either completely full or totally empty. The proposition "the possibility level that the bottle is full is 0.5" describes a degree of belief. One way to interpret 0.5 in that proposition is to define its meaning as: I am ready to bet that it's empty as long as the odds are even (1:1) or better, and I would not bet at any rate that it's full.

==Possibility theory as an imprecise probability theory==
There is an extensive formal correspondence between probability and possibility theories, where the addition operator corresponds to the maximum operator.

A possibility measure can be seen as a consonant [[plausibility measure]] in [[Dempster–Shafer theory]] of evidence. The operators of possibility theory can be seen as a hyper-cautious version of the operators of the [[transferable belief model]], a modern development of the theory of evidence.

Possibility can be seen as an [[upper and lower probabilities|upper probability]]: any possibility distribution defines a unique set of admissible probability distributions by

::&lt;math&gt;\left\{\, p: \forall S\ p(S)\leq \operatorname{pos}(S)\,\right\}.&lt;/math&gt;

This allows one to study possibility theory using the tools of [[imprecise probability|imprecise probabilities]].

==Necessity logic==
We call ''generalized possibility'' every function satisfying Axiom 1 and Axiom 3. We call ''generalized necessity'' the dual of a generalized possibility. The generalized necessities are related with a very simple and interesting fuzzy logic we call ''necessity logic''. In the deduction apparatus of necessity logic the logical axioms are the usual classical [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]]. Also, there is only a fuzzy inference rule extending the usual Modus Ponens. Such a rule says that if α and α → β are proved at degree λ and μ, respectively, then we can assert β at degree min{λ,μ}. It is easy to see that the theories of such a logic are the generalized necessities and that the completely consistent theories coincide with the necessities (see for example Gerla 2001).

The '''"Power of Women"''' (''Weibermacht'' in German) is a medieval and Renaissance artistic and [[literary topos]], showing "heroic or wise men dominated by women", presenting "an admonitory and often humorous inversion of the male-dominated sexual hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;  It was defined by [[Susan L. Smith]] as "the representational practice of bringing together at least two, but usually more, well-known figures from the Bible, ancient history, or romance to exemplify a cluster of interrelated themes that include the wiles of women, the power of love, and the trials of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Babinsky|first=Elen L.|year=1997|title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[American Society of Church History |Church History]] |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=340–341 |doi=10.2307/3170688 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=2298424}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith argues that the topos is not simply a "straightforward manifestation of medieval antifeminism"; rather, it is "a site of contest through which conflicting ideas about gender roles could be expressed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Susan L.|editor=Margaret Schaus|title=Women and Gender in Medieval Europe: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aDhOv6hgN2IC&amp;pg=PA845 |year=2006|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-0415969444 |pages=844–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''c.f.'' Nurse p. 1, who characterises it as arising from the complex religious and social turmoil provoked by the European Reformation of the sixteenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith argues the topos originates in classical literature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Millett |first=Bella |date=22 September 1997 |title=Rev. of Smith, ''The Power of Women'' |journal=[[Medium Aevum]] |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/The+Power+of+Women%3A+A+%27Topos%27+in+Medieval+Art+and+Literature.-a020331549}}&lt;/ref&gt; and finds it in medieval texts such as ''[[Aucassin et Nicolette]]'', ''[[The Consolation of Philosophy]]'', the ''[[Roman de la Rose]]'', and the ''[[Canterbury Tales]]''.&lt;ref name=Harp208&gt;Harp p. 208&lt;/ref&gt;  The topos was attacked by [[Christine de Pizan]] around 1400, who argued that if women wrote these accounts their interpretations would be different from those of men.&lt;ref name= Wolfthal&gt;Wolfthal p. 57&lt;/ref&gt;

In the visual arts, images are found in various media, mainly from the 14th century onwards, and becoming increasingly popular in the 15th century. By then the frequently recurring subjects include [[Judith beheading Holofernes]], [[The tale of Phyllis and Aristotle|Phyllis riding Aristotle]], [[Samson in popular culture#Art|Samson and Delilah]], [[Salome]] and her mother [[Herodias]], [[Jael]] killing [[Sisera]], [[Bathsheba]] bathing in sight of [[David]], the idolatry of [[Solomon]], [[Virgil in his basket]], as well as many depictions of witches, and genre images of wives dominating their husbands. The last group came to be called the '''battle for the trousers'''.&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87; "''strijd om de broek''" in sixteenth century Netherlandish literature and printmaking.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] and [[Potiphar|Potiphar's wife]] and [[Lot (biblical person)#Lot and his daughters|Lot and his Daughters]] were somewhat late joiners to the group, but increasingly popular later on.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 147–148, Nos 20–32 (Judith), 87–110, 120–125; Ainsworth, pp. 59–66; Salomon, pp. 87–88; Hall, 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tomyris]], the [[Scythian]] queen who defeated [[Cyrus the Great]] and abused his corpse, was painted by Rubens and several Italians.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, 305&lt;/ref&gt;

These scenes, mostly shown in consistent compositions involving just two persons and visually distinctive actions, were easily recognisable and seem to have also been represented dramatically in entertainments of various sorts, whether as short scenes or [[tableaux vivants]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, 461&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not clear who first coined the term ''Weibermacht'', but it had evidently gained currency in the sixteenth century [[Northern Renaissance]] in Germany and the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nurse p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visual arts==

In early images from the Gothic period genre subjects or "classical" ones such as ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' and ''Virgil in his Basket'', in fact both medieval legendary accretions, were more popular than the biblical ones predominating later. They often appear on the same pieces as the [[Assault on the Castle of Love]], as on a [[Casket with Scenes of Romances (Walters 71264)|casket in Baltimore]]. This and similar subjects of [[courtly love]] mostly survive on ivory objects for female use, such as caskets or mirror-cases. It shows ladies defending a castle against men, generally unsuccessfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:A woman defends her castle.jpg|But not always]]. More typically the only real resistance is Cupid firing arrows.&lt;/ref&gt; These images are essentially light-hearted romantic fantasy given a comic treatment; such scenes were sometimes staged as light relief at [[tournament]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Roger Sherman Loomis|Loomis, Roger Sherman]], "The Allegorical Siege in the Art of the Middle Ages", ''American Journal of Archaeology'', Vol. 23, No. 3 (Jul.–Sep., 1919), pp.&amp;nbsp;255–269,[https://www.jstor.org/stable/497460 JSTOR (free)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Power of Women theme is especially popular in [[Northern Renaissance]] art from the sixteenth century, which depicts "images drawn from historical, mythological, and biblical sources that illustrate women's power over men, specifically as a result of their sexual attractiveness".&lt;ref&gt;Salomon, 87&lt;/ref&gt; Several of the stories involve the killing of the male, and this and their religious context effectively remove much of the comic potential of the group, but by no means the erotic possibilites exploited by many artists.

The question of the attitudes shown towards violence by women in the cause of virtue is perhaps best seen in the figure of [[Jael]], whose killing of Sisera by hammering a tent peg into his head makes an especially graphic image. According to some feminist critics, depictions of her turned hostile in the Renaissance, and like Judith she is certainly grouped with "bad" figures such as Herodias and Delilah. Yet she was included, with Judith and Esther, as one of [[Hans Burgkmair]]'s "Drei Gut Judin" ("Three Good Jewesses") trio of Biblical heroines in his ''Eighteen Worthies'', adding nine women to the traditional male [[Nine Worthies]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, 29&amp;ndash;39, No 1; Wolfthal, Diane (October 2000).

The Power of Women subjects are seen in painting and other media, but [[old master print|prints]] were their special home. [[Lucas van Leyden]] made two sets of [[woodcut]]s known as ''[[Lucas van Leyden|The Large and Small Power of Women]]''. The subjects featured include [[Adam and Eve]], Samson and Delilah, King Solomon, [[Herod the Great|Herod]] and Herodias, Jael and Sisera, and, less usually, [[Jezebel]] and [[Ahab|King Ahab]]. The woodcuts have somewhat static compositions, and it has been suggested that they draw from [[tableaux vivants]] of the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, pp. 119, 153, Large: Nos 90, 96, 100; Small: Nos 66, 92; Snyder, 461-462. The small set, of 1516&amp;ndash;19 included the scenes with Eve, Jael, Delilah, Solomon, Jezebel and Herodias, the large set of c. 1512 added Virgil and the legend of the ''[[Bocca della Verità]]'' or "Mouth of Truth" in Rome. The ''Aristotle and Phyllis'' of c. 1515 is in the same format but may be a later addition. Since no museum has a full set on the same paper they may have been sold mainly singly.&lt;/ref&gt; Another set by [[Hans Burgkmair]] (1519) is known as the ''Liebestorheiten'' or ''Follies of Love''.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 160, Nos 94, 97. This set contains: ''Samson and Delilah'', Bathsheba and David, The Idolatry of Solomon, and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time there was also an interest, often among the same artists, in women from similar settings who were powerless, or only able to escape their situations by suicide, such as [[Susanna (Book of Daniel)|Susanna]], [[Dido of Carthage]], [[Lucretia]], and [[Verginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1&amp;ndash;14&lt;/ref&gt; The story of [[Esther]] lay somewhere between these two extremes.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Nos 1, 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Little Masters]] were among those artists greatly interested in both groups. The treatment of both groups, especially in prints, was often frankly erotic, and these groups took their place alongside female saints and lovers both mythological and realistic in the common treatments of women in art. Interest in such themes spread to Italy, affecting [[Venice]] first, and the subjects became common in Late Renaissance Italian painting, and even more so during the Baroque, perhaps culminating in the work of [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], who painted nearly all the biblical Power of Women subjects, most more than once. While her choice of subjects is assumed to be driven by her difficult life, [[Cristofano Allori]]'s best known work, ''Judith with the Head of Holofernes'', uses as models his former mistress for [[Book of Judith|Judith]], with her mother as the maid, and a self-portrait for the head of [[Holofernes]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucy Whitaker, Martin Clayton, ''The Art of Italy in the Royal Collection; Renaissance and Baroque'', p.270, Royal Collection Publications, 2007, {{ISBN|9781902163291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern painting, the Cranachs were the first artists to paint the subjects often.&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 66&lt;/ref&gt; In 1513 [[Lucas Cranach the Elder]] decorated the nuptial bed of [[John, Elector of Saxony]] with a set of scenes including ''The Idolatry of Solomon'' as well as ''[[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]]'' (see below) and the ''[[Judgement of Paris]]''. The respective sons of the patron and artist, [[John Frederick I, Elector of Saxony]] and [[Lucas Cranach the Younger]], generated another set of paintings, now in the [[Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister]].&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The possibility has been raised that some of the Cranach workshop's many ''Judith''s are portraits of ladies at the Saxon court;&lt;ref&gt;Ainsworth, pp. 63&amp;ndash;66&lt;/ref&gt; some other paintings of Jael certainly are portraits.

===Themes and context===
[[File:Lucas van Leyden Arisztotelész és Phyllis.jpg|thumb|left|''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'', [[Lucas van Leyden]]]]
Several of these subjects contain a part-comical element of [[role reversal]] in a society that was essentially patriarchal, above all the "quintessential image from the Power of Women topos, ''Phyllis Riding Aristotle''."&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The story of Phyllis and Aristotle dates from the early 13th century (when the ''Lai d'Aristote'' was written) and became the subject of popular poems, plays and moralizing sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Boitani &amp; Torti p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The theme was first analysed by [[Natalie Zemon Davis]] in 1975,&lt;ref&gt;"Women on Top" in her ''Society and Culture in Early Modern France: Eight Essays, Stanford, California: Stanford University Press, 1975''&lt;/ref&gt; who concluded that the "overall functions" of these reversals was that "they afforded an expression of, and an outlet for, conflicts about authority within the system; and they also provided occasions by which the authoritarian current in family, workshop, and political life could be moderated by the laughter of disorder and paradoxical play. Accordingly they served to reinforce hierarchical structure".&lt;ref&gt;Natalie Zemon Davis, "Women on Top", quoted by Russell, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; The role reversal subject of [[Hercules]] and [[Omphale]] did not fit the main Power of Women trope, as Hercules' period serving Omphale was not caused by interaction between them, and they later married. It became popular from the 16th century, and the Cranach family painted many versions showing Omphale and her ladies dressing Hercules in drag.&lt;ref&gt;For a long analysis of the theme, see Rosenthal, Lisa, "Hercules' Distaff", especially p. 128 ff, in ''Gender, Politics, and Allegory in the Art of Rubens'', 2005, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521842441}}, 9780521842440, [https://books.google.com/books?id=tIa0iUVpGbcC&amp;pg=PA128 Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Phyllis Riding Aristotle'' was painted on the walls of several German [[town hall]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt; though the design [[Albrecht Dürer]] made for [[Nuremberg]], as part of a Power of Women cycle, was never carried out.&lt;ref&gt;Foister p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Some sets of prints have ornamental borders that suggest they were intended to be pasted to walls, as many larger prints were. While many of the smaller prints were probably mostly seen by male collectors and their friends, these paintings and wall-mounted prints "must have been intended to entertain or amuse both men and women".&lt;ref&gt;Russell, p. 150; Parshall, pp. 234&amp;ndash;235. Dürer's [[watercolour]] design is in the [[Morgan Library]] ([[:File:Albrecht Dürer - Design for Decoration of the Town Hall of Nuremberg.jpg|see Commons image]]), and has roundels with Bathsheba and David, [[Samson and Delilah (disambiguation)|Samson and Delilah]], and Phyllis riding Aristotle.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Florentine [[Otto prints]], essentially designed for a female audience, show women triumphing over men, though most show pacific scenes of lovers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=756921&amp;partId=1 example, British Museum]. This collection, in the [[British Museum]] is the pattern book of a workshop probably making inserts for small boxes of sweet delicacies such as were given to the guests at weddings.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other large prints intended for walls, where Power of Women subjects are especially common, adopt a different type of composition from the small prints with a few figures, showing large and well-populated panoramic scenes where the key figures can be hard to pick out. ''David and Bathsheba'' or Salome's story are set amid wide townscapes, and Judith kills Holofernes in a corner of a huge battle scene in front of a walled city.&lt;ref&gt;Bartrum, p. 154, Nos. 96, 158, 160; Parshall, pp. 234-235&lt;/ref&gt;

The association of witchcraft specifically and almost exclusively with women was a novelty of the late 15th century, for which the book ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486) remains an emblem, though its significance has been questioned. The interpretation of the many images of witches has been the subject of considerable scholarly interest in recent decades, and many differing interpretations have been put forward. As well as allowing scope for imaginative fantasy, an erotic element is clear, above all in the work of [[Hans Baldung Grien]], the artist most associated with the subject. The seriousness with which either the artist or their audience took the reality of witchcraft has been questioned; to some extent these seem to have been the [[horror movie]]s of their day.&lt;ref&gt;Zika, Charles, "Images of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe", in Levack, Brian P. (ed), ''The Oxford Handbook of Witchcraft in Early Modern Europe and Colonial America'', 2013, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0199578168}}, 9780199578160, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Lum96_FPZp0C&amp;pg=PA143 Google Books]; Russell, pp. 14, 147&amp;ndash;148, Nos 103&amp;ndash;105; Harbison, Craig. ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'', pp. 120&amp;ndash;121, 1995, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|0297835122}}; Bartrum, 69&amp;ndash;70; there is a further account of the development of scholarship by Zika in [https://books.google.com/books?id=SRvhAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA48 pp. 48&amp;ndash;65 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Witch of Endor]] was a previously obscure subject that allowed the combination of biblical and witchcraft interest.

The '''Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/871/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 2007 (as originally made).]&lt;/ref&gt; which originally came into effect at the end of August 1997&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/648/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;  in [[Great Britain]] and in 1999 in [[Northern Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisr/1999/115/contents/made The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations (Northern Ireland) 1999.]&lt;/ref&gt; was the first ''producer responsibility'' legislation in the UK.

The [[Packaging Waste]] Regulations work on the principle of ''Collective Producer Responsibility'' - enforcing producers of packaging to take responsibility for their environmental impact. The Regulations require obligated producers to pay a proportion of the cost of the recovery and recycling of their packaging.

==Proportions==

Companies must show that they have paid for their obligation for recovery and recycling of the packaging. This is achieved through the [[Packaging Recovery Note]] (PRN) System.

Under the Packaging Waste Regulations the so-called 'packaging chain' is divided into four activities, each with a different percentage responsibility:
* '''raw material manufacturer: 6%'''  Manufacturing of packaging raw material, e.g. manufacturer of steel for baked beans cans.
* '''converter: 9%'''  Manufacturing of a recognised packaging item, e.g. manufacturer of the steel can for the baked beans.
* '''packer/filler: 37%'''  Putting a product into packaging or applying packaging to a product, e.g. the company which fills the can with baked beans.
* '''seller: 48%'''  Supplying the packaging to the end user of that packaging, e.g. the supermarket which sells the baked bean can to the consumer. '''OR''' The wholesaler who sells boxed cans of beans would have the selling obligation on the boxes removed by the supermarket.

Companies who directly import packaging, packaged goods or packaging materials are also obligated. The level of their obligation depends on the stage of the chain at which the packaging is brought into the UK but, in every case, they pick up the rolled-up obligations for all stages carried out before the packaging or packaging materials reach the UK.

==The PRN System==

The legislation stipulates that companies who are obligated under the Regulations must prove they have paid for the requisite amount of tonnes to be recovered each year. Reprocessors are licensed to issue a [[Packaging Recovery Note]] (PRN), or PERNs for exported packaging, for each tonne of specific material they have recovered. Regulated companies must buy the appropriate quantity of PRNs for the appropriate materials as proof they have fulfilled their obligations.  For a percentage of each tonne of packaging waste generated, a PRN is required as proof that a tonne of that material ([[wood]], [[paper]], [[glass]], [[plastic]], [[aluminium]] or [[steel]]) has been recycled. The price of PRNs is set by the reprocessors according to the availability of material being recycled. Thus PRNs have joined the [[commodities]] marketplace.

A company falls under the legislation if they: have a turnover of more than £2 million ''and'' handled more than 50 tonnes of packaging in the previous calendar year.

PRNs are certificates issued by accredited reprocessors when packaging waste is recycled or recovered. These PRNs are put onto the open market to be purchased by obligated companies as evidence that they have met their calculated obligation. This can be done directly or through a compliance scheme, of which there are several.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5885">'''Production control''' is the activity of monitoring and [[Control (management)|controlling]] any particular production or operation. Production control is often run from a specific control room or operations room. With [[inventory control]] and [[quality control]], production control is one of the key functions of [[operations management]].&lt;ref name&gt;K.C. Arora. ''Production and Operations Management.'' 2004. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Production control is the activity of monitoring and controlling a large physical facility or physically dispersed service. It is a "set of actions and decision taken during [[Manufacturing|production]] to regulate output and obtain reasonable assurance that the specification will be met."&lt;ref name="SNG 1991"&gt;S. N. Ghosh (ed.) ''Cement and Concrete Science &amp; Technology.'' 1991. p. 419&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Production and Inventory Control Society]], nowadays APICS, defined production control in 1959 as:
:''Production control is the task of predicting, planning and scheduling work, taking into account manpower, materials availability and other capacity restrictions, and cost so as to achieve proper quality and quantity at the time it is needed and then following up the schedule to see that the plan is carried out, using whatever systems have proven satisfactory for the purpose.''&lt;ref&gt;APICS (1959) cited in: Kenneth N. McKay, Vincent C. S. Wiers (2004). ''Practical Production Control: A Survival Guide for Planners and Schedulers,'' p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

Production planning and control in larger factories is often run from a production planning department run by production controllers and a production control manager. Production monitoring and control of larger operations is often run from a central space, called a [[control room]] or [[operations room]] or operations control center (OCC).

The emerging area of Project Production Management (PPM), based on viewing project activities as a production system, adopts the same notion of production control to take steps to regulate the behavior of a production system where in this case the production system is a capital project, rather than a physical facility or a physically dispersed service.

Production control is to be contrasted with project controls. As explained,&lt;ref&gt;"Contrasting Project Production Control with Project Controls," R.J. Arbulu, H-J. Choo, M. Williams, Proc. International Conference on Innovative Production and Construction (IPC 2016), 3–5 October 2016, Darwin, Australia&lt;/ref&gt; project controls have developed to become centralized functions to track project progress and identify deviations from plan and to forecast future progress, using metrics rooted in accounting principles.

Communist countries had a central production control institute, where the agricultural and industrial production for the whole nation was planned and controlled.

In Customer Care environments production control is known as Workforce Management (WFM). Centralized Workforce Management teams are often called Command Center, Mission Control or WFM Shared Production Centers.

== Related types of control in organizations ==
Production control is just one of multiple types of control in organizations. Most commons other types are:
* ''[[Control (management)|Management control]],'' one of the managerial functions like planning, organizing, staffing and directing. It is an important function because it helps to check the errors and to take the corrective action so that deviation from standards are minimized and stated goals of the organization are achieved in a desired manner.
* ''[[Inventory control]],'' the supervision of supply, storage and accessibility of items in order to ensure an adequate supply without excessive oversupply.
* ''[[Quality control]],'' the process by which entities review the [[quality (philosophy)|quality]] of all factors involved in production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6574">In [[mathematics]] and [[optimization]], a '''pseudo-Boolean function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] of the form
:&lt;math&gt;f:\mathbf{B}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;,
where '''B'''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{0,&amp;nbsp;1} is a ''[[Boolean domain]]'' and ''n'' is a nonnegative integer called the [[arity]] of the function.  A [[Boolean function]] is then a special case, where the values are also restricted to 0,1.

==Representations==

Any pseudo-Boolean function can be written uniquely as a [[multi-linear]] polynomial:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = On the determination of the minima of pseudo-Boolean functions|last = Hammer|first = P.L.|date = 1963|journal = Studii ¸si cercetari matematice|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Rosenberg|first2 = I.|last3 = Rudeanu|first3 = S.|issue = 14|publisher = |pages = 359–364|language = Romanian|issn = 0039-4068}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Boolean Methods in Operations Research and Related Areas|last = Hammer|first = Peter L.|publisher = Springer|year = 1968|isbn = 978-3-642-85825-3|location = |pages = |last2 = Rudeanu|first2 = Sergiu}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f(\boldsymbol{x}) = a + \sum_i a_ix_i + \sum_{i&lt;j}a_{ij}x_ix_j + \sum_{i&lt;j&lt;k}a_{ijk}x_ix_jx_k + \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
The '''degree''' of the pseudo-Boolean function is simply the degree of the [[polynomial]] in this representation.

In many settings (e.g., in [[Analysis of Boolean functions|Fourier analysis of pseudo-Boolean functions]]), a pseudo-Boolean function is viewed as a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; that maps &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Again in this case we can uniquely write  &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; as a multi-linear polynomial:
&lt;math&gt; f(x)= \sum_{I\subseteq [n]}\hat{f}(I)\prod_{i\in I}x_i, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; \hat{f}(I) &lt;/math&gt; are Fourier coefficients of &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;[n]=\{1,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Optimization==
Minimizing (or, equivalently, maximizing) a pseudo-Boolean function is [[NP-hard]]. This can easily be seen by formulating, for example, the [[maximum cut]] problem as maximizing a pseudo-Boolean function.&lt;ref name="boroshammer" /&gt;

===Submodularity===
The [[submodular set function]]s can be viewed as a special class of pseudo-Boolean functions, which is equivalent to the condition
:&lt;math&gt; f(\boldsymbol{x}) + f(\boldsymbol{y}) \ge  f(\boldsymbol{x} \wedge \boldsymbol{y}) + f(\boldsymbol{x} \vee \boldsymbol{y}), \; \forall \boldsymbol{x}, \boldsymbol{y}\in \mathbf{B}^n\,. &lt;/math&gt;
This is an important class of pseudo-boolean functions, because they can be [[Submodular set function#Submodular Minimization|minimized in polynomial time]].

===Roof Duality===
If ''f'' is a quadratic polynomial, a concept called ''roof duality'' can be used to obtain a lower bound for its minimum value.&lt;ref name="boroshammer"&gt;Boros and Hammer, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Roof duality may also provide a partial assignment of the variables, indicating some of the values of a minimizer to the polynomial. Several different methods of obtaining lower bounds were developed only to later be shown to be equivalent to what is now called roof duality.&lt;ref name="boroshammer" /&gt;

===Reductions===
If the degree of ''f'' is greater than 2, one can always employ ''reductions'' to obtain an equivalent quadratic problem with additional variables.&lt;ref name="ishikawa2011"&gt;Ishikawa, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; One possible reduction is
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  	-x_1x_2x_3=\min_{z\in\mathbf{B}}z(2-x_1-x_2-x_3)&lt;/math&gt;
There are other possibilities, for example,
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle  	-x_1x_2x_3=\min_{z\in\mathbf{B}}z(-x_1+x_2+x_3)-x_1x_2-x_1x_3+x_1. &lt;/math&gt;
Different reductions lead to different results. Take for example the following cubic polynomial:&lt;ref name="kahlstrandmark"&gt;Kahl and Strandmark, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \displaystyle  	f(\boldsymbol{x})=-2x_1+x_2-x_3+4x_1x_2+4x_1x_3-2x_2x_3-2x_1x_2x_3. &lt;/math&gt;
Using the first reduction followed by roof duality, we obtain a lower bound of -3 and no indication on how to assign the three variables. Using the second reduction, we obtain the (tight) lower bound of -2 and the optimal assignment of every variable (which is &lt;math&gt; {(0,1,1)}&lt;/math&gt;).

===Polynomial Compression Algorithms===
Consider a pseudo-Boolean function &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt; as a mapping from &lt;math&gt;\{-1,1\}^n&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt; f(x)= \sum_{I\subseteq [n]}\hat{f}(I)\prod_{i\in I}x_i. &lt;/math&gt; Assume that each coefficient &lt;math&gt;\hat{f}(I)&lt;/math&gt; is integral. 
Then for an integer &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; the problem P of deciding whether &lt;math&gt; f(x) &lt;/math&gt; is more or equal to &lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; is NP-complete. It is proved in &lt;ref name="crow"&gt;Crowston et al., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; that
in polynomial time we can either solve P or reduce the number of variables to &lt;math&gt; O(k^2\log k) &lt;/math&gt;.
Let &lt;math&gt; r &lt;/math&gt; be the degree of the above multi-linear polynomial for &lt;math&gt; f &lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;ref name="crow"&gt;Crowston et al., 2011&lt;/ref&gt; proved that in polynomial time we can either solve P or reduce the number of variables to &lt;math&gt; r(k-1) &lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38293">'''Rhetoric of science''' is a body of [[academic publishing|scholarly literature]] exploring the notion that the practice of [[science]] is a [[rhetoric]]al activity. It emerged following a number of similarly-oriented disciplines during the late 20th century, including the disciplines of [[sociology of scientific knowledge]], [[history of science]], and [[philosophy of science]], but it is practiced most fully by rhetoricians in departments of English, speech, and communication.

==Overview==
[[Rhetoric]] is best known as a discipline that studies the means and ends of [[persuasion]]. Science, meanwhile, is typically seen as the discovery and recording of [[knowledge]] about the natural world. A key contention of rhetoric of science is that the practice of science is, to varying degrees, persuasive. The study of science from this viewpoint variously examines modes of inquiry, logic, [[argumentation]], the [[ethos]] of scientific practitioners, the structures of scientific publications, and the character of scientific discourse and debates.

For instance, scientists must convince their community of scientists that their research is based on sound scientific method. From a rhetorical point of view, [[scientific method]] involves problem-solution ''[[Rhetoric topos|topoi]]'' (the materials of discourse) that demonstrate observational and experimental competence (arrangement or order of discourse or method), and as a means of persuasion, offer explanatory and [[predictive power]].&lt;ref name=Prelli&gt;[[Lawrence J. Prelli]] (1989) ''A Rhetoric of Science: Inventing Scientific Discourse'', [[University of South Carolina Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp| 185-193}} Experimental competence is itself a persuasive ''topos''.&lt;ref name=Prelli/&gt;{{rp|186}} Rhetoric of science is a practice of suasion that is an outgrowth of some of the [[Rhetoric#Canons|canons of rhetoric]].

==History==
Since 1970, rhetoric of science, as a field involving rhetoricians, flourished. This flourishing of scholarly activity contributed to a shift in the image of science that was taking place.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xv}} A conservative approach to rhetoric of science involves treating texts as communications designed to persuade members of scientific communities. This approach concerns scientific claims that are already considered true as a result of the scientific process rather than the rhetorical process. A more radical approach, on the other hand, would treat these same texts as if the science held within them is also an object of rhetorical scrutiny.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622,3}} Among those in the conservative camp, who view science texts as vehicles of communication, are [[Charles Bazerman]], [[John Angus Campbell]], Greg Myers, Jean Dietz Moss, [[Lawrence J. Prelli]], Carolyn Miller and Jeanne Fahnestock. Bazerman's close readings of works by Newton and Compton as well as his analysis of the reading habits of physicists and others led to a greater understanding of the successes and failures of communication.&lt;ref name=GrE&gt;[[Alan G. Gross]] (1996) "Rhetoric of Science", ''Encyclopedia of Rhetoric and Composition: Communication from Ancient Times to the Information Age''. New York: [[Garland Publishing]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|623,4}} For a depiction of the views of the more radical camp, see the section titled "Critique of Rhetoric of Science".

The history of the rhetoric of science effectively begins with [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s seminal work, ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]'' (1962). He examines first normal science, that is, a practice which he saw as routine, patterned and accessible with a specific method of problem-solving. Building on past knowledge, normal science advances by accretions in a [[knowledge base]].&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xiii}} Kuhn then contrasts normal science with revolutionary science (ground-breaking science marked by a paradigm-shift in thought). When Kuhn began to teach Harvard undergraduates historical texts such as Aristotle's writings on motion, he looked to case studies, and sought first to understand Aristotle in his own time, and then to locate his problems and solutions within a wider context of contemporary thought and actions.
&lt;ref name=Nick&gt;Nickles, Thomas (2003) "Normal Science: From Logic to Case-Based and Model-Based Reasoning", in ''Thomas Kuhn'', edited by Thomas Nickles, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-79648-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|144}} That is to say, Kuhn sought first to understand the traditions and established practices of science.&lt;ref name=Nick/&gt;{{rp|162}} In this instance, [[Michael Polanyi]]'s influence on Kuhn becomes apparent; that is, his acknowledgement of the importance of inherited practices and rejection of absolute objectivity. Observing the changes in scientific thought and practices, Kuhn concluded that revolutionary changes happen through the defining notion of rhetoric: [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=HIL&gt;Harris, Randy Allen (1997) "Introduction", ''Landmark Essays on Rhetoric of Science: Case Studies'', editor Randy Allen Harris, Mahwah: Hermagoras Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xiv}} The critical work of Herbert W. Simons – "Are Scientists Rhetors in Disguise?" in ''Rhetoric in Transition'' (1980) – and subsequent works show that Kuhn's ''Structure'' is fully rhetorical.

The work of Thomas Kuhn was extended by [[Richard Rorty]] (1979, 1989), and this work was to prove fruitful in defining the means and ends of rhetoric in scientific discourse (Jasinski "Intro" xvi). Rorty, who coined the phrase "rhetorical turn", was also interested in assessing periods of scientific stability and instability.

Another component of the shift in science that took place in the past centres on the claim that there is no single scientific method, but rather a plurality of methods, approaches or styles.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xvi}} [[Paul Feyerabend]] in ''[[Against Method]]'' (1975) contends that science has found no "method that turns ideologically contaminated ideas into true and useful theories", in other words; no special method exists that can guarantee the success of science (302).

As evidenced in the early theory papers after Kuhn's seminal work, the idea that rhetoric is crucial to science came to the fore. Quarterly journals in speech and rhetoric saw a flourishing of discussion on topics such as inquiry, [[logic]], argument fields, [[ethos]] of scientific practitioners, argumentation, scientific text, and the character of scientific [[discourse]] and debates. Philip Wander (1976) observed, for instance, the phenomenal penetration of science (public science) in modern life. He labelled the obligation of rhetoricians to investigate science's discourse "The Rhetoric of Science" (Harris "Knowing" 164).

As rhetoric of science began to flourish, discussion arose in a number of areas, including:
* Epistemic rhetoric and the discourses on the nature of semantics, knowledge, and truth: One example is the Robert L. Scott's work on viewing rhetoric as epistemic (1967). By the 1990s, [[epistemic]] rhetoric was a point of contention in the writing of Dilip Gaonkar (see "Critique" below).
* The early 1970s Speech Communication Conference ("Wingspread conference") gave recognition to the fact that rhetoric, in its globalization (multidisciplinary nature), has become a universal [[hermeneutic]] (Gross ''Rhetorical'' 2-5). Much scholastic output evolved around the theory of interpretation (hermeneutics), the knowledge-making and truth-seeking (epistemic) potential of rhetoric of science.
* Argument Fields (part of the Speech Communication Association and American forensic Association program): In this domain the work of [[Stephen Toulmin|Toulmin]] on argument appeals is exemplary. In addition, Michael Mulkay, Barry Barnes and David Bloor, as pioneers of the "[[Sociology of Scientific Knowledge]]" (SSK) movement, fostered a growing sociobiology debate. Others as Greg Myers expressed the benefits of a collaboration between rhetoricians and sociologists. Contributors to discussion pertaining to audience – the way arguments change as they move from the scientific community to the public – include John Lyne and Henry Howe.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxi-xxxii}}
* Scientific Giants: The important works that investigate the suasive powers of exemplars in science include those of Alan Gross&lt;ref&gt;Gross, Alan G. (1990) ''The Rhetoric of Science'', [[Harvard University Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Descartes]], argument fields in optics), John Angus Campbell&lt;ref&gt;[[John Angus Campbell]] (1989) [http://www.arts.uwaterloo.ca/~raha/309CWeb/Campbell%281989%29.pdf The Invisible Rhetorician: Charles Darwin’s Third Party Strategy], ''The Rhetorician'' 7(1): 55–85, via [[University of Waterloo]]&lt;/ref&gt; (Darwin), and Michael Halloran (Watson and Crick). [[J. C. Maxwell]] introduced [[differentiable function|differentiable]] [[vector field]]s ''E'' and ''B'' to express [[Michael Faraday]]'s findings about an [[electric field]] ''E'' and a [[magnetic field]] ''B''. Thomas K. Simpson has described his rhetorical methods, first with a guided study,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas K. Simpson (1997) ''Maxwell on the Electromagnetic Field: a guided study'', [[Rutgers University Press]] {{ISBN|0-8135-2362-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; then a literary appreciation&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Simpson (2005) ''Figures of Thought, a literary appreciation of Maxwell’s Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Green Lion Press&lt;/ref&gt; of ''[[A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism]]'' (1873), and with a book attending to the mathematical rhetoric.&lt;ref&gt;T. K. Simpson (2010) ''Maxwell’s Mathematical Rhetoric: rethinking the Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism'', Green Lion Press, {{ISBN|978-1-888009-36-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other major themes in rhetoric of science include the investigation of the accomplishments and suasive abilities of individuals (ethos) who have left a mark in their respective sciences as well as an age old concern of rhetoric of science – public science policy. Science policy involves deliberative issues, and the first rhetorical study of science policy was made in 1953 by [[Richard M. Weaver]]. Among others, [[Helen Longino]]'s work on public policy implications of low-level radiation continues this tradition.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622}}

The reconstitution of rhetorical theory around the lines of invention ([[inventio]]), [[argumentation]] and stylistic adaptation is going on today (Simons 6). The key question today is whether training in rhetoric can in fact help scholars and investigators make intelligent choices between rival theories, methods or data collection, and incommensurate values (Simons 14).

==Developments and trends==

===Epistemic rhetoric===
Seeing science from the point of texts exhibiting [[epistemology]] based on prediction and control offers new comprehensive ways to see the function of rhetoric of science (Gross "The Origin" 91-92). Epistemic rhetoric of science, in a broader context, confronts issues pertaining to [[truth]], [[relativism]], and knowledge.

Rhetoric of science, as a branch of inquiry, does not look at scientific (natural science) texts as a transparent means of conveying knowledge, but rather it looks at these texts as exhibiting persuasive structures. Although the natural sciences and humanities differ in a fundamental way, the enterprise of science can be viewed hermeneutically as a stream of texts which exhibit an epistemology based on understanding (Gross "On the Shoulders 21). Its task then is the rhetorical reconstruction of the means by which scientists convince themselves and others that their knowledge claims and assertions are an integral part of privileged activity of the community of thinkers with which they are allied (Gross "The Origin" 91).

In an article titled "On Viewing Rhetoric as Epistemic" (1967), Robert L. Scott offers "that truth can arise only from cooperative critical inquiry" (Harris "Knowing" 164). Scott's probe of the issues of belief, knowledge and argumentation substantiates that rhetoric is epistemic. This [[train of thought]] goes back to Gorgias who noted that truth is a product of discourse, not a substance added to it (Harris "Knowing" 164).

Scientific discourse is built on accountability of empirical fact which is presented to a scientific community. Each form of communication is a type of genre that fosters human interaction and relations. An example is the emerging form of the experimental report ([[Charles Bazerman|Bazerman]] "Reporting" 171-176). The suite of [[genres]] to which the rhetoric of science comes to bear on health care and scientific communities is legion.

Aristotle could never accept the unavailability of certain knowledge, although most now believe the contrary (Gross "On Shoulders" 20). That is to say, Aristotle would have rejected the central concern of rhetoric of science: knowledge.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|622}} Knowing itself generates the explanation of knowing, and this is the domain of the [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]]. The knowledge of knowledge compels an attitude of vigilance against the temptation of certainty ([[Humberto Maturana|Maturana]] 239-245).

The claim of the epistemic problematic of rhetoric of science concerns:
* truth - property of statements with respect to other statements
* knowledge - configuration of mutually supporting true statements
* arguments - are situational (first principle of rhetoric)
(Harris "Knowing" 180-181).

===Argument fields===
By the 1980s, [[Stephen Toulmin|Stephen Toulmin's]] work on argument fields published in his book titled ''[[The Uses of Argument]]'' (1958) came to prominence through rhetorical societies such as the Speech Communication Association which adopted a sociological view of science. Toulmin's main contribution is his notion of argument fields that saw a reinvention of the rhetorical concept [[rhetoric topos|topoi]] (topics).&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxi}}

Toulmin discusses at length the pattern of an [[argument]] – data and warrants to support a claim – and how they tend to vary across argument fields (Toulmin 1417-1422). He delineated two concepts of argumentation, one which relied on universal (field-invariant) appeals and strategies, and one which was field dependent, particular to disciplines, movements, and the like. For Toulmin, audience is important because one speaks to a particular audience at a particular point in time, and thus an argument must be relevant to that audience. In this instance, Toulmin echoes [[Paul Feyerabend|Feyerabend]], who in his preoccupation with suasive processes, makes clear the adaptive nature of [[persuasion]].&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxv}}

Toulmin's ideas pertaining to argument were a radical import to [[argumentation theory]] because, in part, he contributes a model, and because he contributes greatly to rhetoric and its subfield, rhetoric of science, by providing a model of analysis (data, warrants) to show that what is argued on a subject is in effect a structured ''arrangement'' of values that are purposive and lead to a certain line of thought.

Toulmin showed in ''Human Understanding'' that the arguments that would support claims as different as the Copernican revolution and the Ptolemaic revolution would not require mediation. On the strength of argument, men of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries converted to Copernican astronomy (Gross "The Rhetoric" 214).

===Incommensurability===
The rhetorical challenge today is to find discourse that crosses disciplines without sacrificing the specifics of each discipline. The aim is to render description of these disciplines intact – that is to say, the goal of finding language that would make various scientific fields "commensurable" (Baake 29). In contrast, incommensurability is a situation where two scientific programs are fundamentally at odds. Two important voices who applied incommensurability to historical and philosophical notions of science in the 1960s are [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]]. Various strands grew out of this idea that bear on issues of communication and invention. These strands are explicated in Randy Allen Harris's four-part [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] that in turn foregrounds his viewpoint that "incommensurability is best understood not as a relation between systems, but as a matter of rhetorical invention and hermeneutics" (Harris "Incommensurability" 1).

[[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|Incommensurability]] of theory at times of radical theory change is at the heart of Thomas Samuel Kuhn's theory of [[paradigms]] ([[Bazerman]] 1). Kuhn's ''Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' offers a vision of scientific change that involves persuasion, and thus he brought rhetoric to the heart of scientific studies.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xiii}}

Kuhn's ''Structure'' provides important accounts related to the concept representation, and the key conceptual changes that occur during a [[scientific revolution]]. Kuhn sought to determine ways of representing [[concept]]s and taxonomies by frames.&lt;ref name=BXA&gt;Barker, Peter, Xiang Chen and Hanne Andersen (2003) "Kuhn on Concepts and Categorization" in ''Thomas Kuhn'', edited by Thomas Nickles, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|224-230}} Kuhn's work attempts to show that incommensurable paradigms can be rationally compared by revealing the compatibility of attribute lists of say a species outlined in a pre-Darwinian and a post-Darwinian milieu accounted for in two incommensurable taxonomies, and that this compatibility is the platform for rational comparison between rival taxonomies.&lt;ref name=BXA/&gt;{{rp|230,1}} With a view to comparing normal science to revolutionary science, Kuhn illustrates his theory of paradigms and theory of concepts within the history of electricity, chemistry and other disciplines. He gives attention to the revolutionary changes that came about as a result of the work of [[Copernicus]], [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Einstein]], [[Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen|Roentgen]], and [[Lavoisier]].

Some scholars, like Thomas C. Walker, feel that Kuhn's theory on paradigms leads to knowledge that is "gained in small, incremental, and almost unremarkable installments." Walker states that while "normal science is narrow, rigid, esoteric, uncritical, and conservative, Kuhn considers it to be the most efficient way to ensure a cumulation of knowledge." According to Walker, while "ignorance and intolerance toward other theoretical frameworks are regrettable features of Kuhn's normal science...meaningful conversations can only occur within a single paradigm."&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Walker, Thomas C. (2010) "The perils of paradigm mentalities: Revisiting Kuhn, Lakatos, and Popper", [[Perspectives on Politics]] 8.02: 433-451&lt;/ref&gt;	

Kuhn's work was influential for rhetoricians, sociologists, and historians (and, in a more muted way, philosophers) for the development of a rhetorical perspective. His view on perception, concept acquisition and language suggest, according to Paul Hoyningen-Huene's analysis of Kuhn's philosophy, a cognitive perspective.&lt;ref name=Nick/&gt;{{rp|183}}

===Ethos===
Scientists are not just persuaded by [[logos]] or argument. Innovative initiatives in science test scientific authority by invoking the authority of past results (initial section of a scientific paper) and the authority of procedure, which establish the scientist's credibility as an investigator (Gross ''Starring'' 26-27).

Examinations of the [[ethos]] of scientists (individually and collectively) spawned significant contributions in the field of rhetoric of science. Michael Halloran notes in "The Birth of Molecular Biology" (''Rhetoric Review'' 3, 1984) – an essay that is a rhetorical analysis of [[James D. Watson]] and Francis H. Crick's "A Structure for Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid" – that a large part of what constitutes a scientific paradigm is the ethos of its practitioners. This ethos is about an attitude and a way of attacking problems and propagating claims.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxxi}}

In "The Rhetorical Construction of Scientific Ethos," Lawrence Prelli provides a systematic analysis of ethos as a tool of scientific legitimation. Prelli's work examines the exchange of information in the court of public opinion. His work provides insight into the ways in which scientific argumentation is legitimized, and thus insight into public science policy. One of the domains of rhetoric is civic life. Rhetorical criticism of science offers much in the investigation of scientific matters that impinge directly upon public opinion and policy-making decisions.&lt;ref name=HIL/&gt;{{rp|xxxiii}}

===Rhetoric and language-games===
Rhetoric can also be defined as ''the strategic use of language'': each scientist tries to make those statements that - given the statements made by their colleagues, and the ones the former expects they will do in the future (e.g., accepting or rejecting the claims made by the former) - maximise the chances of the former's attaining the goals he or she has. So, [[game theory]] can be applied to study the choice of the claims one scientist makes. Zamora Bonilla (2006) argues that, when rhetoric is understood this way, it can be discussed whether the way scientists interact - e.g., through certain scientific institutions like peer review - leads them to make their claims in an efficient or an inefficient way, i.e., whether the 'rhetorical games' are more analogous to '[[invisible hand]]' processes, or to '[[prisoner's dilemma]]' games. If the former is the case, then we can assert that scientific 'conversation' is organised in such a way that the strategic use of language by scientists leads them to reach cognitive progress, and if the opposite is the case, then this would be an argument to reform scientific institutions.

===Rhetorical figures in science===
Corresponding to distinct lines of reasoning, figures of speech are evident in scientific arguments. The same cognitive and verbal skills that are of service to one line of inquiry – political, economic or popular – are of service to science (Fahnestock 43). This implies that there is less of a division between science and the humanities than initially anticipated. Argumentatively useful figures of speech are found everywhere in scientific writing.

[[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] in ''[[Genetics and the Origin of Species]]'' offers a means of reconciliation between Mendelian mutation and Darwinian [[natural selection]]. By remaining sensitive to the interests of naturalists and geneticists, Dobzhansky – through a subtle strategy of [[polysemy]] – allowed a peaceful solution to a battle between two scientific territories. His expressed aim was to review the genetic information bearing on the problem of organic diversity.&lt;ref name=ccc&gt;{{cite book |last= Ceccarelli |first= Leah |title= Shaping Science with Rhetoric: The Cases of Dobzhansky, Schrödinger, and Wilson |publisher= [[University of Chicago Press]] |year= 2001 |isbn= 0226099067 |oclc= 45276826 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|41, 53}} The building blocks of Dobzhansky's interdisciplinary influence that saw much development in two scientific camps were the result of the compositional choices he made. He uses, for instance, prolepsis to make arguments that introduced his research findings, and he provided a metaphoric map as a means to guide his audience.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;{{rp|57,8}} One illustration of metaphor is his use of the term "adaptive landscapes." Seen metaphorically, this term is a way of representing how theorists in two different fields can unite.&lt;ref name=ccc/&gt;{{rp|57}}

Another figure that is important as an aid to understanding and knowledge is [[antimetabole]] (refutation by reversal). [[Antithesis]] also works toward a similar end.

An example of antimetabole:
* Antimetabole often appears in writing or visuals where the line of inquiry and experiment has been characterized by mirror-image objects, or of complementarity, reversible or equilibrium processes. Louis Pasteur's revelation that many organic compounds come in left-and right-handed versions or isomers as articulated at an 1883 lecture illustrates the use of this figure. He argues in lecture that "life is the germ and the germ is life" because all life contains unsymmetrical/asymmetrical processes (Fahnestock 137-140).

===New Materialist Rhetoric of Science===
A more recent trend in rhetorical studies involves participation in the broader [[Speculative realism|new materialist]] movement in philosophy and [[Science, technology and society|science and technology studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herndl|first1=Carl|title=Rhetoric of Science as Non-Modern Practice|date=2000|publisher=Professing Rhetoric: Selected Papers from the 2000 Rhetoric Society of America Conference|pages=215–222}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emerging area of inquiry investigates the role of rhetoric and discourse as an integral part of the [[Materiality (science)| Materialism]] of scientific practice. This approach considers how the methods of natural sciences came into being, and the particular role interaction among scientists and scientific institutions has to play. New materialist rhetoric of science of a feminist variety include those proponents see the progress of the natural sciences as having been purchased at a high cost, a cost that limits the scope and vision of science. Work in this area often draws on scholarship by [[Bruno Latour]], [[Steve Woolgar]], [[Annemarie Mol]], and other new materialist scholars from science and technology studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lynch and Rivers, Eds.|title=Thinking with Bruno Latour in Rhetoric and Composition|date=2015|publisher=Southern Illinois University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work in new materialist rhetoric of science tends to be very critical of a perceived over-reliance on language in more conservative variants of rhetoric of science and has significantly criticized long-standing areas of inquiry such as incommensurability studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graham &amp; Herndl|title=Multiple Ontologies in Pain Management: Towards a Postplural Rhetoric of Science|journal=Technical Communication Quarterly|volume=22|pages=103–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique of rhetoric of science===

====Globalization of rhetoric====
Renewed interest today in rhetoric of science is its positioning as a [[hermeneutic]] meta-discourse rather than a substantive discourse practice.&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|25}} [[Exegesis]] and hermeneutics are the tools around which the idea of scientific production has been forged.

Criticism of rhetoric of science is mainly limited to discussions around the concept of hermeneutics, which can be seen as follows:
* Rhetorical hermeneutics is about a way of reading texts as rhetoric. Rhetoric is both a discipline and a perspective from which disciplines can be viewed. As a discipline, it has a hermeneutic task and generates knowledge; as a perspective, it has the task of generating new points of view (Gross ''Rhetorical'' 111). Whether rhetorical theory can function as a general hermeneutic, a key to all texts, including scientific texts, is still today a point of interest to rhetoricians. Although [[natural sciences]] and [[humanities]] differ in fundamental ways, science as enterprise can be viewed hermeneutically as a suite of texts exhibiting a study of knowledge (epistemology) based on understanding (Gross "On Shoulders" 21).

A recent critique about the rhetoric of science literature asks not if science is understood properly, but rather if rhetoric is understood properly. This dissension centres around the reading of scientific texts rhetorically; it is a quarrel about how rhetorical theory is seen as a global hermeneutic (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 1-13).

[[Dilip Gaonkar]] in "The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science" looks at how critics argue about rhetoric, and he unfolds the global ambitions of rhetorical theory as a general hermeneutic (a master key to all texts), with the rhetoric of science as a perfect site of analysis - a hard and fast case.&lt;ref name=Gaon&gt;[[Dilip Gaonkar]] (1997) "The Idea of Rhetoric in the Rhetoric of Science." In ''Rhetorical Hermeneutics: Invention and Interpretation in the Age of Science''. Eds. Alan G. Gross and William M. Keith, [[State University of New York Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In his analysis of this 'case', Gaonkar looks at rhetoric's essential character first in traditional sense (Aristotilean and Ciceronian). Then he looked at the practice of rhetoric and the model of persuasive speech from the point of agency (productive orientation) or who controls the speech (means of communication). The rhetorical tradition is one of practice, while the theory evinces practice and teaching (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 6-11). Gaonkar asserts that rhetoric seen as a tradition (Aristotilean and Ciceronia), and from the point of view of interpretation (not production or agency), rhetorical theory is "thin." He argues that rhetoric appears as a thinly veiled language of criticism in such a way that it is applicable to almost any discourse.&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|33, 69}}

Gaonkar believes that this type of globalization of rhetoric undermines rhetoric's self-representation as a situated practical art, and in so doing, it runs counter to a humanist tradition. It runs counter to the interpretative function of a critical metadiscourse. If there is no more substance, no anchor, no reference to which rhetoric is attached, rhetoric itself is the substance, or the supplement, and thus becomes substantial, giving rise to the question how well rhetoric functions as interpretative [[discourse]].&lt;ref name=Gaon/&gt;{{rp|77}}

Dilip Gaonkar's provocations have successfully opened the way to a broad reaching discussion that led to the defense of rhetoric analyses of scientific discourse. Responses to Gaonkar's provocations are many, of which two examples follow.
* When Gaonkar asks if a theory grounded in practice can be translated into a theory of interpretation, Michael Leff in "The Idea of Rhetoric as Interpretative Practice: A Humanist's Response to Gaonkar" see his views as too extreme, treating as opposites two positions that are in dialectic tension (rhetoric as production and rhetoric as interpretation), and separating interpretation from practice in order to establish a causal, rather than accidental, relationship between rhetoric and the globalalization of rhetoric (Gross "Intro" ''Rhetorical'' 11).
* [[John Angus Campbell]] in "Strategic Readings: Rhetoric, Intention, and Interpretation" also found in ''Rhetorical Hermeneutics'' is a verification of Leff's analysis (113). He argues, however, against Gaonkar's notion of invention and the mediation between producer or writer and the audience of a text(114). The differences between Campbell and Gaonkar is one of theory, and not whether agency figures in criticism (115).

====New Materialist Rhetoric of Science====
The new materialist approach to rhetoric of science has endorsed Goankar's criticisms of rhetoric of science more generally and seeks to overcome them through interdisciplinary engagement with science and technology studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graham|first1=S. Scott|title=The Politics of Pain Medicine: A Rhetorical-Ontological Inquiry|date=2015|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the new materialist approach, itself, has been subjected to significant criticism within the field, and identified as a radical variant. The question as to the adequacy of rhetoric in its encounter with scientific texts (natural sciences) is problematic on two fronts. The first concerns traditional rhetoric and its capacity as a tool to analyze scientific texts. Secondly, the answer to the question relies on an attack of the epistomological presuppositions of a classical rhetoric of science. For this reason, the radical critique is a call for the renewal of rhetorical theory.&lt;ref name=GrE/&gt;{{rp|626,7}}

In [[abstract algebra]], a '''Robbins algebra''' is an [[Universal algebra#Basic idea|algebra]] containing a single [[binary operation]], usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt;, and a single [[unary operation]] usually denoted by &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt;. These operations satisfy the following [[Universal algebra#Equations|axioms]]:

For all elements ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'':
# [[Associativity]]: &lt;math&gt;a \lor \left(b \lor c \right) = \left(a \lor b \right) \lor c&lt;/math&gt;
# [[Commutativity]]: &lt;math&gt;a \lor b = b \lor a&lt;/math&gt;
# ''Robbins equation'': &lt;math&gt;\neg \left( \neg \left(a \lor b \right) \lor \neg \left(a \lor \neg b \right) \right) = a&lt;/math&gt;

For many years, it was conjectured, but unproven, that all Robbins algebras are [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]s.  This was proved in 1996, so the term "Robbins algebra" is now simply a synonym for "Boolean algebra".

== History ==
In 1933, [[Edward Huntington]] proposed a new set of axioms for Boolean algebras, consisting of (1) and (2) above, plus: 
*''Huntington's equation'': &lt;math&gt;\neg(\neg a \lor b) \lor \neg(\neg a \lor \neg b) = a.&lt;/math&gt;
From these axioms, Huntington derived the usual axioms of Boolean algebra.

Very soon thereafter, [[Herbert Robbins]] posed the "Robbins conjecture", namely that the Huntington equation could be replaced with what came to be called the Robbins equation, and the result would still be [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean algebra]]. &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; would interpret Boolean [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Definition|join]] and &lt;math&gt;\neg&lt;/math&gt; Boolean [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Definition|complement]]. Boolean [[Boolean algebra (structure)#Definition|meet]] and the constants 0 and 1 are easily defined from the Robbins algebra primitives. Pending verification of the conjecture, the system of Robbins was called "Robbins algebra."

Verifying the Robbins conjecture required proving Huntington's equation, or some other axiomatization of a Boolean algebra, as theorems of a Robbins algebra. Huntington, Robbins, [[Alfred Tarski]], and others worked on the problem, but failed to find a proof or counterexample.

[[William McCune]] proved the conjecture in 1996, using the [[automated theorem proving|automated theorem prover]] [[EQP]]. For a complete proof of the Robbins conjecture in one consistent notation and following McCune closely, see Mann (2003). Dahn (1998) simplified McCune's machine proof.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:AALMOZNINO4.JPG|thumb|right|[[Albert Almoznino]]'s shadow art]] --&gt;
{{Performing arts}}
'''Shadowgraphy''' or '''ombromanie''' is the art of performing a story or show using images made by hand shadows. It can be called "cinema in silhouette". Performers are titled as a shadowgraphist or shadowgrapher.

The art has declined since the late 19th century when electricity became available to homes because light bulbs and electric lamps do not give off good shadows and because cinema and television were becoming a new form of entertainment. Shadows are greatly defined by candlelight; therefore hand shadows were common in earlier centuries.

The modern art of hand shadows was made popular by the French entertainer [[Félicien Trewey]] in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quick-change-artistry.com/shadowgraphy.html Quick Change Artistry&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; He popularized the art by making silhouettes of famous personalities.

== Origin ==
Since shadows have existed since the existence of objects obstructing light, it is hard to say when the art was first used by humans for entertainment. It could have been practiced by ancient or later humans, but it probably originated in the [[Far East]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Art of Hand Shadows by Albert Almoznino&lt;/ref&gt; The French entertainer Félicien Trewey was interested in the art of Chinese [[shadow puppet]]ry called Ombres Chinoises, which means "Chinese shadows". He popularized the art of hand shadows when he developed shadows of famous silhouettes. It then became popular in [[Europe]] in the 19th century.

== Prevalence ==
Although the art is popular amongst different kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"&gt;[http://www.geniimagazine.com/wiki/index.php/Shadowgraphy Shadowgraphy - MagicPedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Félicien Trewey perfected the widely known elephant, bird, and cat hand shadows&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/4/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and created some of his own such as The Volunteer, [[Robinson Crusoe]], The Jockey, The Rope Dancer and more.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/artofshadowgraph00trewuoft#page/6/mode/2up The art of shadowgraphy; how it is done&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1889, Trewey joined with [[Alexander Herrmann]] who most likely learned it from him. David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son [[Okito]] (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to ''his'' son [[David (Fu Manchu) Bamberg|Fu Manchu]] (David Theodore Bamberg). Fu Manchu passed his skill to Marcelo Contento, one of his apprentices, who became famous worldwide for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MUM Magazine, March 2000|last=|first=|publisher=Society of American Magicians|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=26|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contento died before he could pass it on to his son.

Other magicians who used hand shadows in their act include [[David Devant]], [[Edward Victor]], and the duo [[Max Holden (magic)|Holden and Graham]] in which Holden was famous for his "Monkey in the Belfry" shadow.&lt;ref name="geniimagazine.com"/&gt;

== Tools ==

=== Hands ===
[[File:Gale's Guernsey shadowgraphy.jpg|thumb|right|An 1889 advertisement with examples of hand shadows]]
The hands and fingers are exercised and different finger positions are practiced to help aid in forming shadows.

=== Light source ===
The light source to be used should be small and bright. The best shadows come from light proceeding from the smallest possible point.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA234&amp;lpg=PA234&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Almoznino suggests a candle, a flashlight (with the lens and reflector removed) or any very small light. If a bulb is used, it should be clear. J. C. Cannell suggests in his book, ''Modern Conjuring For Amateurs'', that the best source of light is the [[electric arc]], which Almoznino agrees to the small [[arc lamp]], and the second best being the [[limelight]] (if used with a high-class jet). Trewey suggests the chalk for the limelight to be cut in a triangular form, or else it will produce a gray border around the shadow. Cannell states another favorite amongst shadowgraphists is the use of [[acetylene gas]] (i.e. acetylene gas lamp or [[carbide lamp]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=oTZo_mLHCs4C&amp;pg=PA236&amp;lpg=PA236&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=true Modern Conjuring for Amateurs - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays it is possible to use a single lensless (for example, SMD) LED.

=== Blank surface ===
Albert Almoznino suggests to use a white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of [[muslin]] or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a [[rear projection screen]], but the light must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Performance ==
The performer sits or stands between the light source and the blank surface, while having the option to perform in front of the performance surface or behind it, with each having different advantages. The performer has another option to perform from the left or the right of the light source. The farther the hands are from the light, the smaller the shadows will be, while the closer the hands are to the light, the larger the shadows will be. Also, the closer the hands are to the blank surface, the sharper the shadows will be. Trewey suggests that the most convenient distance for the light from the hands is four feet while the hands from the performance surface should be about six feet. The performer should always watch their shadows instead of their hands.

Movement helps give the shadows character and brings them to life. Some shadows are performed with accessories attached to the hands or fingers to achieve movements or images not applicable to hands alone.

'''Spongy tissue''' is a type of tissue found both in plants and animals. 

In plants, it is part of the [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]], where it forms a layer next to the [[palisade cell]]s in the [[leaf]]. The spongy mesophyll's function is to allow for the interchange of gases (CO2) that are needed for photosynthesis. The spongy mesophyll cells are less likely to go through photosynthesis than those in the palisade mesophyll. It is also the name of a disorder of fruit ripening which can reduce the value of a fruit yield, especially in [[mango]]. In the alphonso mango variety, this problem is particularly common, giving  soft, white, 'corky' tissue.

Spongy tissue is also a type of [[soft tissue|animal tissue]] which contains smooth muscles, [[fibrous tissues]], spaces, veins, and arteries. An example is the [[corpus spongiosum penis]]. In bone, the spongy tissue is called [[cancellous bone|cancellous tissue]].

'''''Stealing the Mystic Lamb''''' is the title of a non-fiction book by art historian [[Noah Charney]].  The full title of the book is '''''Stealing the Mystic Lamb: The True Story of the World’s Most Coveted Masterpiece'''''.  The book was published in 2010 by PublicAffairs.  It tells the story of The ''[[Ghent Altarpiece]]'' (also known as ''The Adoration of the Mystic Lamb,'' or simply ''The Mystic Lamb''), a monumental oil painting by the Flemish master [[Jan van Eyck]], currently on display in the cathedral of [[Saint Bavo]], in the city of [[Ghent]].  The work is arguably the most influential painting in history, and it is also the most frequently stolen artwork of all-time.  Charney’s book tells the story of the artwork and the many crimes and mysteries of which it was the victim since its completion in 1432.

==Critical Reaction==
Charney’s book received much critical praise, including the following review from [[Kirkus Reviews]] (15 July 2010):

"Charney (Art History/American Univ. of Rome; The Art Thief, 2007, etc.) unsnarls the tangled history of Jan van Eyck’s 15th-century ''The Ghent Altarpiece (aka The Mystic Lamb)'', “the most desired and victimized object of all time.”
With a novelist’s sense of structure and tension, the author adds an easy familiarity with the techniques of oil painting and with the intertwining vines of art and political and religious history. He begins near the end of World War II. As the Reich’s military fortunes crumbled, the Allies scrambled to find where the Nazis concealed their tens of thousands of stolen artworks, many slated for Hitler’s proposed “super museum.” Among them was the Altarpiece. Charney pauses to describe the large work, which comprises 20 individual painted panels, hinged together. Art historians admire it not just for its supreme craftsmanship—described clearly by the author—but also for its historical significance as the world’s first major oil painting. Charney also lists a number of “firsts” that the work represents (e.g., the first to use directed spotlighting) and sketches the biography of van Eyck, which makes Shakespeare’s seem richly detailed by comparison. Commissioned to create the altarpiece for the Saint Bavo Cathedral in Ghent, Belgium, van Eyck took some six years to complete it. As religious and political strife waxed and waned, the painting was always in danger. The Calvinists didn’t like it (the Catholics promptly hid it); Napoleon, perhaps history’s greatest art thief, craved it; a cathedral fire threatened it; the Germans came for it in World War I and again in World War II. Even now, one panel remains at large, though some argue that the replacement copy is actually the original.
A brisk tale of true-life heroism, villainy, artistry and passion."

'''The Author'''

Noah Charney holds advanced degrees in art history from [[The Courtauld Institute]] and [[Cambridge University]].  He is the founding director of [[ARCA, the Association for Research into Crimes against Art]], a non-profit think tank and consultancy group on issues in art crime (www.artcrime.info).  His work in the field of art crime has been praised in such forums as The New York Times Magazine, Time Magazine, The Wall Street Journal, BBC Radio, National Public Radio, El Pais, Vogue, Vanity Fair, and Tatler among others.  He has appeared on radio and television, including ITV, CNBC, and MSNBC and he is in constant demand as a lecturer.  Having recently taught at [[Yale University]], Charney is now Adjunct Professor of Art History at the [[American University of Rome]].  Charney is the author of numerous articles and a novel, [[The Art Thief]] (Atria 2007), which is currently translated into fourteen languages and is a best-seller in four countries.  He is the editor of an academic essay collection entitled [[Art &amp; Crime: Exploring the Dark Side of the Art World]], published by Praeger in 2009 and the [[Museum Time]] series of guides to museums in Spain, published by geoPlaneta in 2010.  He lives in Italy and lectures internationally in the subjects of art history and art crime.

[[File:Tipu's Tiger front view 2006AH4173.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], London showing the prostrate European being attacked]]
'''Tipu's Tiger''' or '''Tippu's Tiger''' is an eighteenth-century [[automaton]] or mechanical toy created for [[Tipu Sultan]], the  ruler of the [[Kingdom of Mysore]] in India. The carved and painted wood casing represents a tiger savaging a near life-size European man. Mechanisms inside the tiger and man's bodies make one hand of the man move, emit a wailing sound from his mouth and grunts from the tiger. In addition a flap on the side of the tiger folds down to reveal the keyboard of a small [[pipe organ]] with 18 notes.

The tiger was created for Tipu and makes use of his personal emblem of the tiger and expresses his hatred of his enemy, the British of the [[East India Company]]. The tiger was discovered in his [[Tipu Sultan's Summer Palace|summer palace]] after East India Company troops [[Battle of Seringapatam|stormed Tipu's capital]] in 1799. The [[Governor-General of India|Governor General]], [[Lord Mornington]] sent the tiger to Britain initially intending it to be an exhibit in the [[Tower of London]]. First exhibited to the London public in 1808 in [[East India House]], then the offices of the East India Company in London, it was later transferred to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] (V&amp;A) in 1880 (accession number 2545(IS)).&lt;ref name="V&amp;A web"&gt;{{cite web

==Background==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger with keyboard on display 2006AH4168.jpg|thumb|Tipu's Tiger with the organ keyboard visible]]
Tipu's Tiger was originally made for Tipu Sultan (also referred to as Tippoo Saib, Tippoo Sultan and other epithets in nineteenth-century literature) in the Kingdom of Mysore (today in the Indian state of [[Karnataka]]) around 1795.&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"/&gt; Tipu Sultan used the tiger systematically as his emblem, employing tiger motifs on his weapons, on the uniforms of his soldiers, and on the decoration of his palaces.&lt;ref name=ModernAsianStudies&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Brittlebank | first1 = K. | title = Sakti and Barakat: The Power of Tipu's Tiger. An Examination of the Tiger Emblem of Tipu Sultan of Mysore | journal = Modern Asian Studies | volume = 29 | issue = 2 | pages = 257–269 | doi =  10.2307/312813| year = 1995 | pmid =  | pmc = | jstor = 312813 | doi-broken-date = 2018-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His throne rested upon a probably similar life-size wooden tiger, covered in gold; like other valuable treasures it was broken up for the highly organised [[Prize money|prize fund]] shared out between the British army.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=23}}&lt;ref&gt;Davis, 156-157 on the throne, and 153-157 on the prize fund generally&lt;/ref&gt;

Tipu had inherited power from his father [[Hyder Ali]], a Muslim soldier who had risen to become ''dalwai'' or commander-in-chief under the ruling Hindu [[Wodeyar dynasty]], but from 1760 was in effect the ruler of the kingdom. Hyder, after initially trying to ally with the British against the [[Maratha]]s, had later become their firm enemy, as they represented the most effective obstacle to his expansion of his kingdom, and Tipu grew up with violently anti-British feelings.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=23-24}}

The tiger formed part of a specific group of large [[caricature]] images commissioned by Tipu showing European, often specifically British, figures being attacked by tigers or elephants, or being executed, tortured and humiliated and attacked in other ways. Many of these were painted by Tipu's orders on the external walls of houses in the main streets of Tipu's capital, [[Seringapatam]].{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=24}} Tipu was in "[[Franco-Indian alliances#Proposals of Tippu Sahib|close co-operation]]" with the French, who were at war with Britain and still had [[French India|a presence]] in South India, and some of the French craftsmen who visited Tipu's court probably contributed to the internal works of the tiger.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=24-25}}

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is typically about half an inch thick, and now much reinforced on the inside following bomb damage in World War II. There are many openings at the head end, formed to match the pattern of the inner part of the painted tiger stripes, which allow the sounds from the pipes within to be heard better, and the tiger is "obviously male". The top part of the tiger's body can be lifted off to inspect the mechanics by removing four screws. The construction of the human figure is similar but the wood is much thicker.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p=66}} Examination and analysis by the V&amp;A conservation department has determined that much of the current paint has been restored or overpainted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6099083 V&amp;A Conservation in Action - Tippoo's Tiger] video, accessed, 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The human figure is clearly in European costume, but authorities differ as to whether it represents a soldier or civilian; the current text on the V&amp;A website avoids specifying, other than describing the figure as "European".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html Tippoo's Tiger on Victoria &amp; Albert Museum website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060825074241/http://www.vam.ac.uk/collections/asia/object_stories/Tippoo's_tiger/index.html |date=25 August 2006 }}; to Ord-Hume he is "a European soldier" (Part 1, 21), but to de Almeida and Gilpin he is "an English gentleman" (p. 35)&lt;/ref&gt;

The operation of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's throat, with its opening at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a "regular grunting sound" simulating the roar of the tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, summarized at p. 64 and throughout in more detail.&lt;/ref&gt;

The style of both shell and workings, and analysis of the metal content of the original brass pipes of the organ (many have been replaced), indicates that the tiger was of local manufacture. The presence of French artisans and French army engineers within Tipu's court has led many historians to suggest there was French input into the mechanism of this automaton.&lt;ref name=Archer&gt;{{cite book

==History==
[[File:Tipu's Tiger Salmond 1800.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The first published illustration of Tipu's Tiger in [[James Salmond]]'s book of 1800]]
Tipu's Tiger was part of the extensive plunder from Tipu's palace captured in the fall of Seringapatam, in which Tipu died, on 4 May 1799, at the culmination of the [[Fourth Anglo-Mysore War]]. An ''[[aide-de-camp]]'' to the Governor General of the East India Company, [[Richard Wellesley, 1st Marquess Wellesley]], wrote a memorandum describing the discovery of the object:&lt;ref&gt;The St James's Chronicle, April 1800; also reported in the Edinburgh Caledonian Mercury 24 April 1800.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stronge|2009|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"In a room appropriated for musical instruments was found an article which merits particular notice, as another proof of the deep hate, and extreme loathing of Tippoo Saib towards the English. This piece of mechanism represents a royal Tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an Organ, within the body of the Tyger. The sounds produced by the Organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress intermixed with the roar of a Tyger. The machinery is so contrived that while the Organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up, to express his helpless and deplorable condition. The whole of this design was executed by Order of Tippoo Sultaun. It is imagined that this memorial of the arrogance and barbarous cruelty of Tippoo Sultan may be thought deserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

The earliest published drawing of Tippoo's Tyger was the frontispiece for the book "A Review of the Origin, Progress and Result, of the Late Decisive War in Mysore with Notes" by [[James Salmond]], published in London in 1800. It preceded the move of the exhibit from India to England and had a separate preface titled "Description of the Frontispiece" which said:&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle24"&gt;As quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/thistle24.htm|title=2.4 Tippoo's Tiger: Frontispiece |author=Wood, Col Mark |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"This drawing is taken from a piece of mechanism representing a royal tyger in the act of devouring a prostrate European. There are some barrels in imitation of an organ within the body of the tyger, and a row of keys of natural notes. The sounds produced by the organ are intended to resemble the cries of a person in distress, intermixed with the roar of a tyger. The machinery is so contrived, that while the organ is playing, the hand of the European is often lifted up to express his helpless and deplorable condition.

The whole of this design is as large as life, and was executed by order of Tippoo Sultaun, who frequently amused himself with a sight of this emblematic triumph of the Khoodadaud, over the English, Sircar. The piece of machinery was found in a room of the palace at Seringapatam appropriated for the reception of musical instruments, and called the Rag Mehal.

The original wooden figure from which the drawing is taken will be forwarded, by the ships of this season, to the Chairman of the Court of Directors, to be presented to his Majesty. It is imagined that this characteristic emblem of the ferocious animosity of Tippoo Sultaun against the British Nation may not be thought undeserving of a place in the Tower of London."}}

Unlike Tipu's throne, which also featured a large tiger, and many other treasures in the palace, the materials of Tipu's Tiger had no intrinsic value, which together with its striking iconography is what preserved it and brought it back to England essentially intact. The Governors of the East India Company had at first intended to present the tiger to the Crown, with a view to it being displayed in the [[Tower of London]], but then decided but to keep it for the Company. After some time in store, during which period the first of many "misguided and wholly unjustified endeavours at "improving" the piece" from a musical point of view may have taken place, it was displayed in the reading-room of the [[British East India Company|East India Company]] Museum and Library at [[East India House]] in [[Leadenhall Street]], London from July 1808.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|pp=29-31}}&lt;ref&gt;153-157&lt;/ref&gt;

It rapidly became a very popular exhibit, and the crank-handle controlling the wailing and grunting could apparently be freely turned by the public. The French author [[Gustave Flaubert]] visited London in 1851 to see the [[Great Exhibition]], writes [[Julian Barnes]], but finding nothing of interest in [[The Crystal Palace]], visited the East India Company Museum where he was greatly enamoured by Tipu's Tiger.&lt;ref name="Pritchett Symbols"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00routesdata/1700_1799/tipusultan/symbols/symbols.html |title=Symbols |author=Pritchett, Prof Frances W.  |year=2000 |website=Tipu Sultan of Mysore (r. 1782-99) |publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=18 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1843 it was reported that "The machine or organ ... is getting much out of repair, and does not altogether realize the expectation of the visitor".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 79&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the crank-handle disappeared, to the great relief of students using the reading-room in which the tiger was displayed, and ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'' later reported that
{{quote|"These shrieks and growls were the constant plague of the student busy at work in the Library of the old India House, when the Leadenhall Street public, unremittingly, it appears, were bent on keeping up the performances of this barbarous machine. Luckily, a kind fate has deprived him of his handle, and stopped up, we are happy to think, some of his internal organs... and we do sincerely hope he will remain so, to be seen and admired, if necessary, but to be heard no more".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 79, quoting ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|The Athenaeum]]'', June 5, 1869, p. 766&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:Leadenhall Street Museum.png|thumb|left|300px|Engraving of the East India Company Museum in Leadenhall Street. Tipu's Tiger can be seen to the left.]]

When the East India Company was taken over by the Crown in 1858, the tiger was stored in Fife House, [[Whitehall]] until 1868, when it moved down the road to the new [[India Office]], which occupied part of the building still used by today's [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. In 1874 it was moved to the India Museum in [[South Kensington]], which was in 1879 dissolved, with the collection distributed between other museums; the V&amp;A records the tiger as acquired in 1880. During World War II the tiger was badly damaged by a German bomb which brought down the roof above it, breaking the wooden casing into several hundred pieces, which were carefully pieced together after the war, so that by 1947 it was back on display. In 1955 it was exhibited in New York at the [[Museum of Modern Art]] through the summer and spring.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Keats-Shelley"&gt;{{cite journal |jstor=30210016 |title=News and Notes|author=Mann, Phyllis G. |journal=Keats-Shelley Journal, Vol 6.

In recent times, Tipu's Tiger has formed an essential part of museum exhibitions exploring the historical interface between Eastern and Western civilisation, colonialism, ethnic histories and other subjects, one such being held at the Victoria and Albert Museum itself in autumn 2004 titled "Encounters:the meeting of Asia and Europe, 1500&amp;ndash;1800".&lt;ref name="Jaffer (2007)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jaffer |first1=Amin |editor1-first=Francisco José |editor1-last=Gomes |others=Alexandra Curvelo, Clare Anderson , Bhaswati Bhattacharya , Kévin Le Doudic , Momin Chaudhury , Samuel Berthet , Bhagwan S.

The organ was considered too fragile to travel to Scotland for the exhibition. Instead, a full-sized replica made of fibre glass and painted by Derek Freeborn, was exhibited in its place. The replica itself also had an earlier Scottish association, having been made in 1986 for 'The Enterprising Scot' exhibition, which was held to commemorate the October 1985 merger of the [[Royal Scottish Museum]] and the [[National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland]] to form a new entity - the [[National Museum of Scotland]].&lt;ref name="Tiger&amp;Thistle11"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tiger11.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206054703/http://www.tigerandthistle.net/tiger11.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 February 2008 |title=1.1 Tippoo's Tiger |author=Unattributed |year=2000 |website=The Tiger and the Thistle - Tipu Sultan and the Scots in India |publisher=The National Galleries of Scotland. |accessdate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today Tipu's Tiger is arguably the best-known single work in the Victoria and Albert Museum as far as the general public is concerned. It is a "must-see" highlight for school-children's visits to the Victoria and Albert Museum, and functions as an iconic representation of the museum, replicated in various forms of memorabilia in the museum shops including [[postcard]]s, model kits and stuffed toys.&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=KrommBakewell2010&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kromm|first1=Jane|last2=Bakewell|first2=Susan Benforado|title=A history of visual culture: Western civilization from the 18th to the 21st century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bO2scveOMokC&amp;pg=PA272|accessdate=17 July 2011|date=2 February 2010|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84520-492-1|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors can no longer operate the mechanism since the device is now kept in a glass case.

The British hunted tigers, not just to emulate the [[Mughals]] and other local elites in this "royal" sport, but also as a symbolic defeat of Tipu Sultan and any other ruler who stood in the path of British domination.&lt;ref name=Sramek2006/&gt; The tiger motif was used in the "Seringapatam medal" which was awarded to those who participated in the 1799 campaign, where the British lion was depicted as overcoming a prostrate tiger, the tiger being the dynastic symbol of Tipu's line. The Seringapatam medal was issued in gold for the highest dignitaries who were associated with the campaign as well as select officers on general duty, silver for other dignitaries, field officers and other staff officers, in copper-[[bronze]] for the non-commissioned officers and in [[tin]] for the privates. On the reverse it had a frieze of the storming of the fort while the obverse showed, in the words of a nineteenth-century tome on medals, "the BRITISH LION subduing the TIGER, the emblem of the late Tippoo Sultan's government, with the period when it was effected and the following words 'ASSUD OTTA-UL GHAULIB', signifying the Lion of God is the conqueror, or the conquering Lion of God."&lt;ref name="Carter_1893_Medals"&gt;{{Cite book |publisher = Norie and Wilson |publication-place = London |title = War medals of the British army, and how they were won |url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL14047956M/War_medals_of_the_British_army_and_how_they_were_won. |last= Carter |first= Thomas |authorlink= Thomas Carter (writer) |edition = War medals of the British army, and how they were won. |publication-date = 1893 |accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Motives for collection of articles, such as Tipu's Tiger, are seen by literary historian Barrett Kalter as having a social and cultural context.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kalter |first1=Barrett  |last2= |first2= |year=2008 |title=Review Essay: "Shopping, Collecting, and Feeling at Home" |journal=Eighteenth-Century Fiction |volume=20 |issue=3, Article 11 |pages= 469–477|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/eighteenth_century_fiction/v020/20.3.kalter.html |doi= 10.1353/ecf.0.0008|accessdate=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collection of Western and Indian art by Tipu Sultan is seen by Kalter as motivated by the need to display his wealth and legitimise his authority over his subjects who were predominantly Hindu and did not share his religion, viz. Islam.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt; In the case of the East India Company, collection of documents, artefacts and ''objet's d'art''&amp;nbsp; from India helped develop the idea of a subjugated Indian populace in the minds of the British people, the thought being that the possession of such objects of a culture represented understanding of, dominance over, and mastery of that culture.&lt;ref name="Kalter 2008"/&gt;

==As a musical instrument==
[[File:Tipu Sultan's Tiger.JPG|thumb|Side view, showing how the handle when turned gets in the way of the player of the keyboard]]

In a detailed study published in 1987 of the tiger's musical and noise-making functions, Arthur W.J.G. Ord-Hume concluded that since coming to Britain, "the instrument has been ruthlessly reworked, and in doing so much of its original operating principles have been destroyed".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 31, though his main discussion of the matter is in his Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; There are two ranks of pipes in the organ (as opposed to the wailing and grunting functions), each "comprising eighteen notes, [which] are nominally of 4ft pitch and are [[unison]]s - i.e. corresponding pipes in each register make sounds of the same musical pitch. This is an unusual layout for a pipe organ although while selecting the two stops together results in more sound ... there is also detectable a slight beat between the pipes so creating a [[Voix céleste|celeste]] effect. ... it is considered likely that as so much work has been done ... this characteristic may be more an accident of tuning than an intentional feature".{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|p=69}} The tiger's grunt is made by a single pipe in the tiger's head and the man's wail by a single pipe emerging at his mouth and connected to separate [[bellows]] located in the man's chest, where they can be accessed by unbolting and lifting off the tiger. The grunt operates by cogs gradually raising the weighted "grunt-pipe" until it reaches a point where it slips down "to fall against its fixed lower-board or reservoir, discharging the air to form the grunting sound"{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987b|pp=64-66, photos 67-68}} Today all the sound-making functions rely on the crank-handle to power them, though Ord-Hume believes this was not originally the case.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}

Works on the noise-making functions included those made over several decades by the famous organ-building firm [[Henry Willis &amp; Sons]], and Henry Willis III, who worked on the tiger in the 1950s, contributed an account to a monograph by Mildred Archer of the V&amp;A. Ord-Hume is generally ready to exempt Willis work from his scathing comments on other drastic restorations, which "vandalism" is assumed to be by unknown earlier organ-builders.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 30, and Part 2 ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;
There was a detailed account of the sound-making functions in ''[[The Penny Magazine]]'' in 1835, whose anonymous author evidently understood "things mechanical and organs in particular".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 75, preceding his full reproduction of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; From this and Ord-Hume's own investigations, he concluded that the original operation of the man's "wail" had been intermittent, with a wail only being produced after every dozen or so grunts from the tiger above, but that at some date after 1835 the mechanism had been altered to make the wail continuous, and that the bellows for the wail had been replaced with smaller and weaker ones, and the operation of the moving arm altered.{{sfn|Ord-Hume, 1987a|p= 66}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/8973957 video] of [[David Dimbleby]] playing the grunt and wail only&lt;/ref&gt;

Puzzling features of the present instrument include the placing of the handle, which when turned is likely to obstruct a player of the keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 1, 21&lt;/ref&gt; Ord-Hume, using the 1835 account, concludes that originally the handle (which is a nineteenth-century British replacement, probably of a French original) only operated the grunt and wail, while the organ was operated by pulling a string or cord to work the original bellows, now replaced.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 71, 73, 75, 77, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The keyboard, which is largely original, is "unique in construction", with "square ivory buttons" with round [[lathe]]-turned tops instead of conventional keys. Though the mechanical functioning of each button is "practical and convenient" they are spaced such that "it is almost impossible to stretch the hand to play an octave".&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, 73, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The buttons are marked with small black spots, differently placed but forming no apparent pattern in relation to the notes produced and corresponding to no known system of marking keys.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 69, and see videos linked at the end of the section&lt;/ref&gt; The two stop control knobs for the organ are located, "rather confusingly", a little below the tiger's testicles.&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Part 2, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument is now rarely played, but there is a V&amp;A video of a recent performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vimeo.com/6699473 Vimeo.com] ''Conservation in Action - Playing Tippoo's Tiger Part 2'', and [http://vimeo.com/6099330 ''Part 1'', with the top of the tiger removed], accessed 17 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Saint Vitus''' ({{IPAc-en|v|aɪ|t|ə|s}}), according to Christian legend, was a [[Christian]] [[saint]] from [[Sicily]]. He died as a [[martyr]] during the [[persecution of Christians]] by co-ruling [[List of Roman Emperors|Roman Emperors]] [[Diocletian]] and [[Maximian]] in 303. Vitus is counted as one of the [[Fourteen Holy Helpers]] of medieval Roman Catholicism. 
Saint Vitus' Day is celebrated on 15 June. In places where the [[Julian Calendar]] is used, this date coincides, in the 20th and 21st centuries, with 28 June on the [[Gregorian Calendar]].

In the late [[Middle Ages]], people in [[Germany]] and countries such as [[Latvia]] celebrated the feast of Vitus by dancing before his statue. This dancing became popular and the name "Saint Vitus Dance" was given to the [[neurological disorder]] [[Sydenham's chorea]]. It also led to Vitus being considered the patron saint of dancers and of entertainers in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv07.htm |title=Saint Vitus |publisher=Saints.sqpn.com |date= |accessdate=2013-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120808173149/http://saints.sqpn.com/saintv07.htm |archive-date=2012-08-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitus is considered the [[patron saint]] of [[actor]]s, [[comedian]]s, [[dancer]]s, and [[epileptic]]s, similarly to [[Genesius of Rome]]. He is also said to protect against [[lightning]] strikes, animal attacks and oversleeping. Vitus is the patron saint of the city of [[Rijeka]] in [[Croatia]]; the towns of [[Ciminna]] &amp; [[Vita, Sicily|Vita]] in [[Sicily]], [[Forio]] on the Island of [[Ischia]], in [[Campania]], [[Italy]]; the contrada of San Vito, in [[Torella dei Lombardi]], in [[Avellino]], [[Italy]]; the town of [[Winschoten]]{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} in the [[Netherlands]], the italian colony of [[San Vito (Costa Rica)]] in Costa Rica, and the town of [[St. Vith]] located in [[Belgium]].  

Various places in [[Austria]] and [[Bavaria]] are named [[Sankt Veit (disambiguation)|Sankt Veit]] in his honour.

==Martyrdom of Saints Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia==
[[File:Vitusmodestuscrescentia.jpg|thumb|left|The martyrdom of Vitus, Modestus, and Crescentia, from a fourteenth-century manuscript]]

According to the legend, Vitus, Modestus and Crescentia were martyrs under [[Diocletian]]. The earliest testimony for their veneration is offered by the "[[Martyrologium Hieronymianum]]" (ed. [[G. B. de Rossi]]-[[Louis Duchesne]], 78: "In Sicilia, Viti, Modesti et Crescentiae"). The fact that the note is in the three most important manuscripts indicates that it was also in the common exemplar of these, which appeared in the fifth century. The same ''Martyrologium'' has under the same day another mention of a Vitus at the head of a list of nine martyrs, with the statement of the place, in [[Eboli]], "In [[Lucania]]", that is, in the Roman province of that name in [[southern Italy]] between the Tuscan Sea and the [[Gulf of Taranto]]. It is easily possible that it is the same martyr Vitus in both cases.

According to J. P. Kirsch,&lt;ref&gt;The author of [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15490b.htm the article] in the [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] from which the information in this section is drawn&lt;/ref&gt; the testimony to the public veneration of the three saints in the fifth century proves that they are historical martyrs. There are, nevertheless, no historical accounts of them, nor of the time or the details of their martyrdom.

During the sixth and seventh centuries a purely legendary [[narrative]] of their martyrdom appeared which appears to be based upon other [[legend]]s, especially on the legend of [[Saint Potitus]], and ornamented with accounts of fantastic miracles. According to this legend, which has no apparent historical value, Vitus was a 7-year-old son of a senator of Lucania (some versions make him 12 years old). He resisted his father's attempts, which included various forms of torture, to make him turn away from his faith. He fled with his tutor Modestus and Modestus's wife Crescentia, who was Vitus's nanny, to Lucania. He was taken from there to Rome to [[exorcism|drive out a demon]] which had taken possession of a son of the Emperor Diocletian. This he did, and yet, because he remained steadfast in the Christian faith, he was [[tortured]] together with his tutors. By a [[miracle]] an [[angel]] brought back the three to Lucania, where they died from the tortures they had endured. Three days later Vitus appeared to a distinguished matron named Florentia, who then found the bodies and buried them in the spot where they were.

==Veneration==
[[File:St Vitus Cathedral from south.jpg|thumb|upright|[[St. Vitus Cathedral]] is the main church of the former imperial capital, [[Prague]].]]

The veneration of the martyrs spread rapidly in Southern Italy and Sicily, as is shown by the note in the "Martyrologium Hieronymianum". Pope [[Gregory the Great]] mentions a monastery dedicated to Vitus in Sicily ("Epist.", I, xlviii, P.L., LXXXVII, 511).

The veneration of St. Vitus, the chief saint of the group, also appeared very early at Rome. [[Pope Gelasius I]] (492-496) mentions a shrine dedicated to him (Jaffé, "Reg. Rom. Pont.", 2nd ed., I, 6 79), and at Rome in the seventh century the chapel of a deaconry was dedicated to him ("Liber Pont.", ed. Duchesne, I, 470 sq.).

In 756 AD, it is said that the [[relics]] of St. Vitus were brought to the [[Saint-Denis Abbey|monastery of St-Denis]] by [[Saint Fulrad|Abbot Fulrad]]. They were later presented to Abbot Warin of [[Corvey]] in Germany, who solemnly transferred some of them to this abbey in 836. From Corvey the veneration of St Vitus spread throughout Westphalia and in the districts of eastern and northern Germany. His cult grew in [[Prague]], Bohemia when, in 925 A.D., king [[Henry I of Germany]] presented as a gift the bones of one hand of St. Vitus to [[Wenceslaus I, Duke of Bohemia|Wenceslaus]], Duke of Bohemia. Since then, this relic has been a sacred treasure in the [[St. Vitus Cathedral]] in Prague.

The cult of St. Vitus became very popular in Slavic lands, where his name (Sveti Vid) may have replaced the old cult of the god of light [[Svetovid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/nameE.htm |title=SVIBOR - The Meaning and the Origin of the Word |publisher=Mzos.hr |date=1996-06-14 |accessdate=2013-12-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305105129/http://www.mzos.hr/svibor/nameE.htm |archive-date=2012-03-05 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was a significant date for both Princip and the archduke. It was the day of St. Vitus, the patron saint of Serbia,}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Croatia]], 123 churches are dedicated to St. Vitus. In [[Hungary]] he has been venerated as ''Szent Vid'' since the early Middle Ages. In [[Bulgaria]], it is called Vidovden (Видовден) or Vidov Den (Видов ден) and is particularly well known among the [[Shopi]], in the western part of the country.

Saint Vitus is one of the [[Fourteen Martyrs]] who give aid in times of trouble. He is specifically invoked against [[Sydenham's chorea|chorea]], which is called ''St. Vitus Dance''. 

He is represented as a young man with a palm-leaf, in a cauldron, sometimes with a raven and a lion, his [[Saint symbology|iconographic attribute]] because according to the legend he was thrown into a cauldron of boiling tar and molten lead, but miraculously escaped unscathed.

The names of Saints Modestus and Crescentia were added in the 11th century to the Roman Calendar,&lt;ref name=CR&gt;"Calendarium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 1969), p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; so that from then on all three names were celebrated together until 1969, when their feast was removed from the [[General Roman Calendar]]. Saint Vitus is still recognized as a saint of the [[Catholic Church]], being included in the [[Roman Martyrology]] under June 15,&lt;ref&gt;"Martyrologium Romanum" (Libreria Editrice Vaticana 2001 {{ISBN|88-209-7210-7}})&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] may be celebrated in his honor on that day wherever the [[Roman Rite]] is celebrated,&lt;ref&gt;[[General Instruction of the Roman Missal]], [http://www.salesianer.de/liturgie/igmr2002.htm 355]&lt;/ref&gt; while Modestus and Crescentia, who are associated with Vitus in legend, have been omitted, because they appear to be merely fictitious personages.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

The saint's feast day is also the subject of a popular weather rhyme: "If St. Vitus' Day be rainy weather, it shall rain for thirty days together". This rhyme often appears in such publications as [[almanac]]s; its origin is uncertain.

Michael J. Towsend writes that "the phrase 'The patron saint of [[Methodism]] is St Vitus' summed up with reasonable accuracy many people's impressions of the Methodist Church. Methodists, surely, are supremely busy people, always rushing around organizing things and setting up committees to do good works. They can generally be relied upon to play their part in running [[Christian Aid Week]], the sponsored walk for the local hospice or the group protesting about homelessness, and they are known, even now, to be activists in trades unions and political parties."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A sacramental spirituality for  Methodism|last=Townsend|first=Michael J.|work=The Way|publisher=[[Society of Jesus]]|page=100|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bobcat urbanLandscape.jpg|thumb|A bobcat (''[[Lynx rufus]]'') using a wildlife corridor to cross between habitats in an urban area.]]

A '''wildlife corridor''', '''habitat corridor''', or '''green corridor'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201180024/http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/england/professionals/en/1115310689250.html |date=1 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; is an area of [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] connecting [[wildlife]] populations separated by human activities or structures (such as roads, development, or logging). This allows an exchange of individuals between populations, which may help prevent the negative effects of [[inbreeding]] and reduced genetic diversity (via [[genetic drift]]) that often occur within isolated populations.  Corridors may also help facilitate the re-establishment of populations that have been reduced or eliminated due to [[Disturbance (ecology)|random events (such as fires or disease)]].

This may potentially moderate some of the worst effects of habitat fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bond, M.|date=2003|title=Principles of Wildlife Corridor Design. Center for Biological Diversity|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/publications/papers/wild-corridors.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Biologivaldiversity.org|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; wherein [[urbanization]] can split up habitat areas, causing animals to lose both their natural habitat and the ability to move between regions to use all of the resources they need to survive.  Habitat fragmentation due to [[Human development theory|human development]] is an ever-increasing threat to [[biodiversity]], and habitat corridors are a possible mitigation.

==Purpose==
The main goal of implementing habitat corridors is to increase [[biodiversity]]. When areas of land are broken up by human interference, population numbers become unstable and many animal and plant species become endangered. By re-connecting the fragments, the population fluctuations can decrease dramatically. Corridors can contribute to three factors that stabilize a population: 
* '''[[Colonisation (biology)|Colonization]]'''—animals are able to move and occupy new areas when food sources or other natural resources are lacking in their core habitat.
* '''[[Animal migration|Migration]]'''—species that relocate seasonally can do so more safely and effectively when it does not interfere with human development barriers.
* '''Interbreeding'''—animals can find new mates in neighboring regions so that [[genetic diversity]] can increase and thus have a positive impact on the overall population.

Rosenberg et.al. (1995) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Daniel K. |last2=Noon |first2=Barry R. |last3=Meslow |first3=E. Charles |title=Towards a definition of wildlife corridor |journal=Integrating People and Wildlife for a Sustainable Future |date=1995 |volume=Proceedings of the First International Wildlife Congress |pages=436–9 |url=https://www.fs.usda.gov/treesearch/pubs/3662 |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; were among the first to define what constitutes a wildlife corridor. The definitions of "[[biological corridor]]" (i.e., wildlife corridor) had, in the early years of studying corridors, been "vague and inconsistent, and often they confound form and function" Rosenberg et.al. developed a [[conceptual model]] that emphasized the role of a wildlife corridor as a facilitator of movement that is not restricted by requirements of [[native vegetation]] or intermediate [http://www.umass.edu/landeco/research/fragstats/documents/Conceptual%20Background/What%20is%20a%20Landscape/What%20is%20a%20Landscape.htm target patches of habitat]. Their definition simply required that movement to a target patch via the corridor be greater that if the corridor were absent.

Although corridors had originally been implemented with the assumption that they would increase biodiversity, not enough research had been done to come to a solid conclusion. The case for corridors has been built more on intuition and much less on [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] (Tewksbury et al. 2002). Tewksbury et. al. claimed that the early controversies had arisen because most studies had been limited in that they had a narrow taxonomic focus and, that if corridors facilitate animal movement, they should also have strong indirect effects on plant [[populations]] due to increased [[pollen]] and [[seed]] by animals. Results of their 2002 experiment provided a large-scale experimental demonstration that [[habitat]] (or wildlife) corridors facilitate movement of disparate [[Taxon|taxa]] between otherwise isolated patches even after controlling for area effects (Tewksbury et al, 2002&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tewksbury |first1=Joshua |title=Corridors affect plants, animals, and their interactions in fragmented landscapes |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=October 1, 2002 |volume=99 |issue=20 |pages=12923–6 |doi=10.1073/pnas.202242699 |pmid=12239344 |pmc=130561 |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/99/20/12923.short |accessdate=14 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;).  Another factor that needs to be taken into account is what species the corridor is intended for. Some species have reacted more positively to corridors than others.

A habitat corridor could be considered as a possible solution in an area where the destruction of a natural area has greatly affected its [[native species]]. Development such as [[roads]], [[buildings]], and [[farms]] can interrupt plants and animals in the region being destroyed. Furthermore, [[natural disaster]]s such as [[wildfire]]s and [[flood]]s can leave animals with no choice but to evacuate. If the habitat is not connected to a safer one, it will ultimately lead to death. A remaining portion of natural habitat is called a remnant, and such portions need to be connected because when migration decreases, extinction increases (Fleury 1997).

Corridors can be made in two distinct areas—either water or land. Water corridors are called riparian ribbons and usually come in the form of rivers and streams. Land corridors come on a scale as large as wooded strips connecting larger woodland areas. However, they can also be as simple as [[Hedge|a line of shrubs along a sidewalk]] (Fleury 1997). Such areas can facilitate the movement of small animals, especially birds, from tree to tree, until they find a safe habitat to nest in. Not only do minimal corridors aid in the movement of animals, they are also aesthetically pleasing, which can sometimes encourage the community to accept and support them.

== Users ==
Species can be categorized in one of two groups; passage users and corridor dwellers.

Passage users occupy corridors for brief periods of time. These animals use corridors for such events as [[wikt:migration|seasonal migration]], [[Biological dispersal|dispersal]] of a juvenile, or moving between parts of a large home range. Usually large [[Herbivory|herbivores]], medium to large [[carnivore]]s, and migratory species are passage users (Beier &amp; Loe 1992). One common misconception is that the corridor only needs to be wide enough for the passage users to get through. However, the corridor still must be wide enough to be safe and also encourage the animals to use it, even though they do not live out their entire lives in it.

Corridor dwellers can occupy the passage anywhere from several days to several years. Species such as [[plants]], [[reptiles]], [[amphibians]], [[birds]], [[insects]], and small [[mammals]] can spend their entire lives in linear habitats. In this case, the corridor must include everything that a species needs to live and breed, such as soil for [[germination]], burrowing areas, and multiple other breeding adults (Beier &amp; Loe 1992).

== Types ==
Habitat corridors can be categorized according to their width. Typically the wider the corridor, the more use it will get from species. However, the width-length ratio, as well as design and quality play just as important of a role in creating the perfect corridor (Fleury 1997). The strip of land will suffer less from [[edge effect]]s such as weeds, predators, and chemicals if it is constructed properly.  The following are three divisions in corridor widths: 
* '''Regional''' – (&gt;500m wide); connect major ecological gradients such as migratory pathways.
* '''Sub-regional''' – (&gt;300m wide); connect larger vegetated landscape features such as ridgelines and valley floors.
* '''Local''' – (some &lt;50m); connect remnant patches of gullies, wetlands, ridgelines, etc.

Habitat corridors can also be divided according to their continuity. Continuous corridors are strips that are not broken up, while “stepping stone” corridors are small patches of suitable habitat. When stepping stones are arranged in a line, they form a strip of land connecting two areas, just like a continuous corridor would. Both kinds provide linkages between protected core areas and stimulate or allow species to migrate.

Finally, corridors can come in the form of [[underpass]]es or [[overpass]]es, which can be very safe for both animals and humans. Many busy highways cross through natural habitats that native species occupy, as well. Large animals such as deer become a hazard when they cross in front of [[traffic]] and get hit. An overpass or an underpass serves as a bridge to facilitate the movement of animals across a busy road. Observations have shown that underpasses are actually more successful than overpasses because many times animals are too timid to cross over a bridge in front of traffic and would prefer to be more hidden (Dole et al. 2003).
[[Image:Estakada ponad Bogdanką Poznań.jpg|thumb|Overpasses such as this one allow for traffic to continue for human convenience, while allowing wildlife to pass unharmed beneath from place to place.]]

== Costs ==
Corridors can be expensive to plan out and put into action. For example, Daniel Simberloff et al. states that “a bridge that would maintain a [[Riparian zone|riparian corridor]] costs about 13 times as much per [[lane mile|lane-mile]] as would a road that would sever the corridor.” He also states that maintenance of a corridor would be much more costly than refuges for [[endangered species]]. It would simply be easier to move animals between refuges than to buy land, install a corridor, and maintain it. However, where the goal is not just to preserve a few large animal species but to protect biodiversity among all plants and animals, then habitat corridors may be the only option.  Corridors are going to be expensive to implement no matter what, but it does depend on the type, location, and size, which can all vary to a great degree. With the lack of field data on the effectiveness, many agencies are not willing to consider putting in corridors.

== Monitoring use ==
{{Tone|section|date=March 2008}}
It is extremely important for researchers to pay attention to the population changes in animals after a corridor has been implemented to ensure that there are no harmful effects. Researchers can use both [[Mark and recapture|mark-recapture techniques]] and evaluate [[Gene flow|genetic flow]] in order to observe how much a corridor is being used. Marking and recapturing animals is more useful when keeping a close eye on individual movement (Mech &amp; Hallet 2001). The only problem is that tagging animals and watching them does not tell anyone whether the migrating individuals are successfully mating with other populations in connected areas of land. On the other hand, genetic techniques can be more effective in evaluating migration and mating patterns.

One of the most important goals of developing a corridor is to increase migration in certain animal species. By looking at a population’s [[gene flow]], researchers can understand the genetic consequences of corridors (Mech &amp; Hallett 2001). The migration patterns of an entire population are much more important than the movements of a few individuals. From these techniques, researchers will better understand whether or not habitat corridors are increasing biodiversity.

Stephen Mech and James Hallett introduce an additional reason genetic techniques are more useful; they “measure average migration rates over time, which reveals the effects of fragmentation of several generations and is not as sensitive to current population sizes as mark-recapture studies are.” For example, when a population is extremely small, mark-recapture is almost impossible. Clearly, genetic analysis of a species is the best way to determine if animals are actually using corridors to move and reproduce.

==Design==
According to new research, wildlife corridors are best built with a certain degree of randomness or asymmetry, rather than built symmetrically. The research was conducted at UC Davis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/10/081020135221.htm|title=Designing wildlife corridors|publisher=Sciencedaily.com|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wildlife corridors are susceptible to [[edge effect]]s; habitat quality along the edge of a habitat fragment is often much lower than in core habitat areas. Wildlife corridors are important for large species requiring significant sized [[range (biology)|range]]s; however, they are also vital as connection corridors for smaller animals and plants as well as ecological connectors to provide a ''[[rescue effect]]''.

== Examples ==

Both the safety of animals and humans can be achieved through the creation of corridors. For example, deer commonly cross roads in order to get to other grazing land. When they are faced with a car coming at them, they freeze; this puts both the deer and the human’s life in danger. In [[Alberta|Alberta, Canada]], an overpass was constructed to keep animals off of the busy highway; the area is part of a [[national park]], so many different creatures roam the area. The top of the bridge is covered in the native grass of the area so that it blends in better and animals will not know the difference. Gates were also put of on either side of the overpass to help guide animals in the right direction (Semrad 2007).

In [[Southern California]], 15 underpasses and drainage [[culvert]]s were observed to see how many animals used them as corridors. They proved to be especially effective on wide-ranging species such as carnivores, [[mule deer]], small mammals, and reptiles, even though the corridors were not intended specifically for animals. Researchers also learned that factors such as surrounding habitat, underpass dimensions, and human activity also played a role in how much use they got. From this experiment, much was learned about what would constitute a successful habitat corridor (Dole et al. 2003).

In [[South Carolina]], five remnant areas of land were monitored; one was put in the center and four were surrounding it. Then, a corridor was put between one of the remnants and the center. Butterflies that were placed in the center habitat were two to four times more likely to move to the connected remnant rather than the disconnected ones. Furthermore, male holly plants were placed in the center region, and female holly plants in the connected region increased by 70 percent in seed production compared to those plants in the disconnected region. The most impressive dispersal into the connected region, though, was through bird droppings.  Far more plant seeds were dispersed through bird droppings in the corridor-connected patch of land (M. 2002).

There have also been positive effects on the rates of transfer and interbreeding in [[vole]] populations. A control population in which voles were confined to their core habitat with no corridor was compared to a treatment population in their core habitat with passages that they could use to move to other regions. Females typically stayed and mated within their founder population, but the rate of transfer through corridors in the males was very high. Researchers are not sure why the females did not move about as much, but it is apparent that the corridor effectively transferred at least some of the species to another location for breeding (Aars 1999).

In 2001, a wolf corridor was restored through a golf course in [[Jasper National Park]], [[Alberta]], which enabled [[Gray wolf|wolves]] to pass through the course. After this restoration, wolves passed through the corridor frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Shepherd, B|author2=J. Whittington |date=2006|title=Response of wolves to corridor restoration and human use management|journal=Ecology and Society |volume=11 |issue=2|url=http://www.ecologyandsociety.org/vol11/iss2/art1/|accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the first demonstrations that corridors are used by wildlife, and can be effective in decreasing fragmentation. Earlier studies had been criticised for failing to demonstrate that corridor restoration leads to a change in wildlife behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Daniel K. Rosenberg|author2=Barry R. Noon |author3=E. Charles Meslow|title=Biological Corridors: Form, Function, and Efficacy|journal=BioScience|volume=47|issue=10 |date=November 1997|pages=677–687|jstor=1313208|doi=10.2307/1313208}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Elephant corridor===
Elephant corridors are narrow strips of land that allow elephants to move from one habitat patch to another. There are 88 identified elephant corridors in India.

In Africa, [[Botswana]] houses the largest number of free-roaming elephant herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourafricansafari.com/articles/new-way-to-protect-africas-elephant-herds|title=Elephant corridors in Botswana to protect the herds|author=Fran|website=Your African Safari|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elephants Without Borders (EWB) studies the movement of elephants is working to gain community support of local community corridors, so that elephants and humans can co-exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elephantswithoutborders.org/living_with_elephants.php|title=Elephants Without Borders Living with elephants|publisher=Elephantswithourborders.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major wildlife corridors===
Several artificial wildlife corridors have been created, these include:
* the Paséo Pantera (also known as the MesoAmerican Biological corridor or [[Paseo del Jaguar|Paséo del Jaguar]])
* the Eastern Himalayan Corridor
* China-Russia Tiger Corridor
* Tandai Tiger Corridor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panthera.org/programs/tiger/tiger-corridor-initiative|title=Panthera|publisher=Panthera.org|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[European Green Belt]]
* The Siju-Rewak Corridor, located in the Garo Hills of India, protects an important population of elephants(thought to be approximately 20% of all the elephants that survive in the country).This corridor project links together the Siju Wildlife Sanctuary and the Rewak Reserve Forest in Meghalaya State, close to the India-Bangladesh border. This area lies within the meeting place of the Himalayan Mountain Range and the Indian Peninsula and contains at least 139 other species of mammal, including tiger, clouded leopard and the Himalayan black bear.
* the [[Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]] is a network of corridors and habitats created for wildlife in the Netherlands&lt;ref&gt;[[:nl:Ecologische hoofdstructuur|Ecologische Hoofdstructuur]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluation ==
Some animal species are much more apt to use habitat corridors than others depending on what their migration and mating patterns are like. For example, many cases of birds and butterflies successfully using corridors have been observed. Less successful stories have come out of mammals such as deer. How effective a corridor is may simply rely on what species it is directed towards (Tewskbury 2002). Corridors created with birds in mind may be more successful because they are highly migratory to begin with.

Human interference is almost inevitable with the quickly increasing population. The goal behind habitat corridors shows the most hope for solving habitat fragmentation and restoring biodiversity as much as possible. Although there are many positives and negatives, there may be enough positives to continue studying and improving corridors. It is truly difficult to say whether corridors are the solution to increasing biodiversity, because each one must be judged on its own.  Each corridor has its own set of standards and goals that may set it apart from another one.

===Negatives===
A major downfall to habitat corridors is that not much information has been gathered about their success. Due to the lack of positive data, many agencies will not allow corridors to be established because they are unsure of their effectiveness. Another problem with corridors is that they are not as useful as simply preserving land so that it cannot be fragmented. However, it is becoming very difficult to set aside land for nature reserves when road-building, industry, and [[urban sprawl]] are all competing for space.

Even if corridors are sought as a solution, it does not necessarily mean that animals will use them. Especially in the case of overpasses, research shows that animals do not like to use them to get to another remnant area of land. Usually overpasses are built over busy highways, and many species are too timid to expose themselves in front of all of the traffic. As more roads and buildings arise, there becomes less space to try to preserve.

Habitat corridors need to be species-specific (not every kind of animal will use every kind of corridor) and corridors can be barriers to some species.  For instance plants may use road verges as corridors however some mammals will not cross roads to reach a suitable habitat.

When a corridor is implemented, many times development is so close by, that it becomes difficult to build a wide enough passage. There is usually a very limited amount of space available for corridors, so buffers are not usually added in (Rosenberg 1997). Without a buffer zone, corridors become susceptible to harmful outside factors from city streets, [[suburb]] development, rural homes, [[forestry]], cropland, and feedlots.

Unfortunately, another limiting factor to the implementation of corridors is money. With such inconclusive data about the effectiveness of connecting land, it is difficult to get the proper funding. Those who would be in charge of the corridor design and construction would ask such questions as, “What if the corridors affect species negatively?” and “What if they actually aid in the spread of disease and catastrophic events?” Furthermore, there is a possibility that corridors could not only aid in the dispersal of native organisms, but invasive ones, as well (Beier &amp; Loe 1998). If [[invasive species]] take over an area they could potentially threaten another species, even to the point of extinction.

Although wildlife corridors have been proposed as solutions to habitat and wildlife population fragmentation, there is little evidence that they are broadly useful as a conservation strategy for all biodiversity in non-developed or less-developed areas, compared to protecting connectivity as the relevant ecological attribute. In other words, corridors may be a useful meme for conservation planning/ers, but the concept has less meaning to wildlife species themselves. Very few wildlife follow easily identified "corridors" or "linkages" (e.g., using [[Computer simulation|computer modeling]]), instead most species meander and opportunistically move through landscapes during daily, seasonal, and dispersal movement behavior. Wildlife corridors may be useful in highly developed landscapes where they are easily identified as the last remaining and available habitat.

===Positives===
Habitat corridors may be defenseless against a number of outside influences, but they are still an efficient way of increasing biodiversity. Strips of land aid in the movement of various animal species and [[pollen]] and [[Biological dispersal|seed dispersal]], which is an added benefit to the intended one (M. 2002). For example, when insects carrying pollen or birds carrying seeds travel to another area, plant species effectively get transported, as well.

Another positive aspect of corridors is that they allow both animals and humans to occupy virtually the same areas of land, and thus co-exist where without the corridor this would not be possible. Large animals such as [[bear]]s can be attracted to residential areas in search of food due to lack of natural resources because of [[habitat fragmentation]]. A corridor would provide a passage for the bears to [[Foraging|forage]] in other locations, so that they would not pose as much of a threat to humans.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3092">A '''windpost''' is a [[Structural engineering|structural]] item used in the design and [[construction]] of [[masonry]] walls to increase lateral wall stability and protect them against damage from horizontal forces imposed by wind pressure, crowd or handrail loads.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Susan. ''Architect's working details''. vol. 10. London: Emap construct, 2004. 42. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They are normally constructed from mild [[Structural steel|steel channel]] sections, supported at the head and the foot between floor slab levels and/or the principal steelwork sections forming the [[steel frame|structural frame]] of the building. In cavity walls, the windpost will typically be fixed into the inner and outer leafs of the wall by specialist fixings and fastenings at regular intervals along its length. The windposts will be spaced along the walls of the building at regular intervals as calculated by the engineer to suit the required loadings. 

In most cases a windpost is a large and very unwieldy element that can often weigh in excess of 400kg. The manufacture and delivery of both steel and concrete windposts has a significant carbon footprint and once delivered to site, their storage requires large areas to be set aside. The procurement of windposts, including the design process, often requires a lead time of four to five weeks. The length and weight of windposts makes them particularly difficult to manoeuvre into position in confined spaces. When installed as part of an internal wall, significant health and safety risks exist for the installers in lifting the windpost to its vertical position. There is no recognised mechanical lifting method to safely erect windposts.

The properties of steel windposts have inherent fire integrity, acoustic, air tightness and thermal movement issues, all of which require additional measures to achieve specification compliance at extra cost.

As an alternative to steel windposts, when the primary structure is composed of reinforced concrete, secondary structures are cast in situ to provide lateral support to masonry panels.

Recently, a new innovative technique of reinforcing blockwork walls has been developed and used in many Crossrail projects in the UK.  It consists in using uniquely designed hollow blocks to allow the construction of reinforced concrete beams and columns within the blockwork construction, which eliminate the need for traditional windposts or lintels. 
This new technique maximises masonry wall strength without thickening the wall or harming its appearance and allows the architects to design and create uninterrupted blockwork panels with flexible detailing options, whilst retaining the performance characteristics of traditional masonry such as fire integrity, acoustic performance and [[air permeability]]. This modular approach also provides the adaptability for contractors to make late changes to construction without affecting the build programme and creates seamless walls which do not require any fire protection.

'''World energy resources''' are the estimated maximum capacity for energy production given all available resources on [[Earth]]. They can be divided by type into [[fossil fuel]], [[nuclear fuel]] and [[renewable resource]]s.

== Fossil fuel ==
{{Main article|Fossil fuel}}

Remaining reserves of fossil fuel are estimated as:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2010_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2010.pdf  Proven energy reserves, BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

{|class="wikitable"
!width="100"|'''   Fuel   '''
!width="150"|'''Proven energy reserves in [[Zetta-|Z]][[Joule|J]] (end of 2009)'''
|-
|   Coal  || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;19.8
|-
|   Gas   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;36.4
|-
|   Oil   || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;8.9
|}

These are the proven energy reserves; real reserves may be up to a factor 4 larger. Significant uncertainty exists for these numbers. Estimating the remaining fossil fuels on the planet depends on a detailed understanding of Earth's crust. While modern drilling technology makes it possible to drill wells in up to 3&amp;nbsp;km of water to verify the exact composition of the geology, one half of the [[ocean]] is deeper than 3&amp;nbsp;km, leaving about a third of the planet beyond the reach of detailed analysis.

In addition to uncertainty in real reserves, there is significant uncertainty in technological and economical factors that impact what percentage of reserves can be recovered gainfully. In general the easiest to reach deposits are the first extracted. Factors affecting the cost of exploiting the remaining reserves include the accessibility of fossil deposits, the level of sulfur and other pollutants in the oil and the coal, transportation costs, and societal instability in producing regions.

===Coal===
{{Main article|Coal#World_coal_reserves|l1=World coal reserves}}
Coal is the most abundant and burned fossil fuel. This was the fuel that launched the industrial revolution and has continued to grow in use; China, which already has many of the world's most polluted cities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,501031124-543833,00.html The Middle Landfill]&lt;/ref&gt; was in 2007 building about two coal-fired power plants every week.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/6769743.stm  China building more power plants]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/041707/opi_opinion1.shtml COAL: Scrubbing its future]&lt;/ref&gt; Coal is the fastest growing fossil fuel and its large reserves would make it a popular candidate to meet the energy demand of the global community, short of global warming concerns and other pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/business/worldbusiness/11chinacoal.html Pollution From Chinese Coal Casts a Global Shadow] accessed 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[International Energy Agency]] the proven reserves of coal are around 909 billion tonnes, which could sustain the current production rate for 155 years,&lt;ref&gt;IEA (2006), p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; although at a 5% growth per annum this would be reduced to 45 years, or until 2051. With the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] it is possible to make liquid fuels such as diesel and jet fuel from coal. In the United States, 49% of electricity generation comes from burning coal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/epa/epat1p1.html EIA sources of electricity]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural gas===
{{Main article|Natural gas}}
Natural gas is a widely available fossil fuel with estimated 850 000&amp;nbsp;km³ in recoverable reserves and at least that much more using enhanced methods to release shale gas.  Improvements in technology and wide exploration led to a major increase in recoverable natural gas reserves as shale fracking methods were developed.  At present usage rates, natural gas could supply most of the world's energy needs for between 100 and 250 years, depending on increase in consumption over time.

===Oil===
{{See also|Oil reserves|Peak oil}}
It is estimated that there may be 57&amp;nbsp;ZJ of oil reserves on Earth (although estimates vary from a low of 8&amp;nbsp;ZJ,&lt;ref name=EIA&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Statistical Review of World Energy 2009]], [[BP]] | url = http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | title = Consumption by fuel, 1965 - 2008 | format = XLS | date = July 31, 2006 | accessdate = 2009-10-24 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090708203819/http://www.bp.com/liveassets/bp_internet/globalbp/globalbp_uk_english/reports_and_publications/statistical_energy_review_2008/STAGING/local_assets/2009_downloads/statistical_review_of_world_energy_full_report_2009.xls#'Primary%20Energy%20-%20Consumption'!A1 | archivedate = July 8, 2009 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting of currently proven and recoverable reserves, to a maximum of 110&amp;nbsp;ZJ&lt;ref name="Oil Gas Industry Stats"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oiljobsource.com/oil-gas-industry-statistics.html|title=Oil Gas Industry Stats| publisher= oiljobsource.com| accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) consisting of available, but not necessarily recoverable reserves, and including optimistic estimates for unconventional sources such as [[tar sands|oil sands]] and [[oil shale]]. Current consensus among the 18 recognized estimates of supply profiles is that the peak of extraction will occur in 2020 at the rate of 93-million barrels per day (mbd). Current oil consumption is at the rate of 0.18&amp;nbsp;ZJ per year (31.1 billion barrels) or 85 mbd.

There is growing concern that [[peak oil|peak oil production]] may be reached in the near future, resulting in severe [[Oil price increases since 2003|oil price increases]].&lt;ref name="wsj111907golddavis"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also theories that peak of the global oil production may occur in as little as 2–3 years. The ASPO predicts peak year to be in 2010. Some other theories present the view that it has already taken place in 2005. World crude oil production (including lease condensates) according to [[US EIA]] data decreased from a peak of 73.720 mbd in 2005 to 73.437 in 2006, 72.981 in 2007, and 73.697 in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/ipsr/t41d.xls International Petroleum Monthly] Retrieved 10 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; According to peak oil theory, increasing production will lead to a more rapid collapse of production in the future, while decreasing production will lead to a slower decrease, as the [[Normal distribution|bell-shaped curve]] will be spread out over more years.

In a stated goal of increasing oil prices to $75/barrel, which had fallen from a high of $147 to a low of $40, [[OPEC]] announced decreasing production by 2.2 mbd beginning 1 January 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/7786456.stm Opec agrees record oil output cut] retrieved 21 December 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sustainability===
Political considerations over the security of supplies, environmental concerns related to [[global warming]] and [[sustainability]] are expected to move the world's energy consumption away from fossil fuels. The concept of [[peak oil]] shows that about half of the available petroleum resources have been produced, and predicts a decrease of production.

A government moves away from fossil fuels would most likely create economic pressure through [[emissions trading|carbon emissions]] and [[green tax]]ation. Some countries are taking action as a result of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and further steps in this direction are proposed. For example, the [[European Commission]] has proposed that the [[energy policy of the European Union]] should set a binding target of increasing the level of renewable energy in the EU's overall mix from less than 7% in 2007 to 20% by 2020.&lt;ref name="roadmap21"&gt;{{cite web | title = Communication from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council: Renewable Energy Roadmap: Renewable Energies in the 21st century; building a sustainable future - COM(2006) 848 | url = http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Commission of the European Communities | date = 10 January 2007 | accessdate = 2007-01-27 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070128104118/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/energy_policy/doc/03_renewable_energy_roadmap_en.pdf | archivedate = 28 January 2007 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The antithesis of sustainability is a disregard for limits, commonly referred to as the Easter Island Effect, which is the concept of being unable to develop sustainability, resulting in the depletion of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;[http://strategy.sauder.ubc.ca/nemetz/jibe.pdf Basic Concepts of Sustainable Development for Business Students]&lt;/ref&gt; Some estimate that, assuming current consumption rates, current oil reserves could be completely depleted by 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Proved1 Reserves of Oil and Natural Gas, Most Recent Estimates|url=http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|publisher=Energy Information Administration|accessdate=14 November 2016|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217151346/http://www.eia.gov/international/reserves.html|archivedate=17 February 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear fuel==
{{See also|Nuclear power|Nuclear energy policy}}

===Nuclear energy===
{{See also|Nuclear fuel}}
The [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] estimates the remaining uranium resources to be equal to 2500&amp;nbsp;ZJ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Global Ur Resources to Meet Projected Demand: Latest Edition of "Red Book" Predicts Consistent Supply Up to 2025| url= http://www.iaea.org/NewsCenter/News/2006/uranium_resources.html | date = 2 June 2006 | publisher = International Atomic Energy Agency | accessdate= 2007-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assumes the use of [[breeder reactor]]s, which are able to create more [[fissile]] material than they consume. [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|IPCC]] estimated currently proved economically recoverable uranium deposits for once-through fuel cycles reactors to be only 2 ZJ. The ultimately recoverable uranium is estimated to be 17 ZJ for once-through reactors and 1000 ZJ with reprocessing and fast breeder reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Nakicenovic, Nebojsa| title= IPCC Special Report on Emissions Scenarios |url= http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc/emission/071.htm| publisher = Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change | accessdate=2007-02-20|display-authors=etal}} [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Resources and technology do not constrain the capacity of nuclear power to contribute to meeting the energy demand for the 21st century. However, political and environmental concerns about [[nuclear safety]] and [[radioactive waste]] started to limit the growth of this energy supply at the end of last century, particularly due to a number of [[List of civilian nuclear accidents|nuclear accidents]]. Concerns about [[nuclear proliferation]] (especially with [[plutonium]] produced by breeder reactors) mean that the development of nuclear power by countries such as [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran]] and [[Syria]] is being actively discouraged by the international community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7364269.stm |title=Syria 'had covert nuclear scheme' |newspaper=BBC News |date=2008-04-25 |accessdate=2010-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although at the beginning of the 21st century uranium is the primary nuclear fuel worldwide, others such as thorium and hydrogen had been under investigation since the middle of the 20th century.

Thorium reserves significantly exceed those of uranium, and of course hydrogen is abundant. It is also considered by many to be easier to obtain than [[uranium]]. While [[uranium mines]] are enclosed underground and thus very dangerous for the miners, [[thorium]] is taken from open pits, and is estimated to be roughly three times as abundant as uranium in the Earth's crust.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/crux/2015/01/16/thorium-future-nuclear-energy/#.VPfjkXbFo1w&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, numerous facilities throughout the world have burned [[Thorium]].

===Nuclear fusion===
Alternatives for energy production through fusion of hydrogen has been under investigation since the 1950s.  No materials can withstand the temperatures required to ignite the fuel, so it must be confined by methods which use no materials.  Magnetic and inertial confinement are the main alternatives ([[Cadarache]], [[Inertial confinement fusion]]) both of which are hot research topics in the early years of the 21st century.

[[Fusion power]] is the process driving the sun and other stars. It generates large quantities of heat by fusing the nuclei of hydrogen or helium isotopes, which may be derived from seawater. The heat can theoretically be harnessed to generate electricity. The temperatures and pressures needed to sustain fusion make it a very difficult process to control. Fusion is theoretically able to supply vast quantities of energy, with relatively little pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm Fusion Energy: Safety] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720021002/http://www.efda.org/fusion_energy/safety_and_the_environment.htm |date=2011-07-20 }} European Fusion Development Agreement (EFDA).  2006.  Retrieved on 2007-04-03&lt;/ref&gt; Although both the United States and the European Union, along with other countries, are supporting fusion research (such as investing in the [[ITER]] facility), according to one report, inadequate research has stalled progress in fusion research for the past 20&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fire.pppl.gov/us_fusion50yr_dean.pdf Fifty years of U.S. fusion research - An overview of programs st]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Renewable resources==
{{Main article|Renewable resource}}
Renewable resources are available each year, unlike non-renewable resources, which are eventually depleted. A simple comparison is a coal mine and a forest. While the forest could be depleted, if it is managed it represents a continuous supply of energy, vs. the coal mine, which once has been exhausted is gone. Most of earth's available energy resources are renewable resources. Renewable resources account for more than 93 percent of total U.S. energy reserves. Annual renewable resources were multiplied times thirty years for comparison with non-renewable resources. In other words, if all non-renewable resources were uniformly exhausted in 30 years, they would only account for 7 percent of available resources each year, if all available renewable resources were developed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eia.doe.gov/cneaf/electricity/pub_summaries/renew_es.html Renewable Resources in the U.S. Electricity Supply]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solar energy===
{{Main article|Solar energy}}
Renewable energy sources are even larger than the traditional fossil fuels and in theory can easily supply the world's energy needs. 89&amp;nbsp;PW&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"&gt;{{cite book | last = Tester | first = Jefferson W. | authorlink = | title = Sustainable Energy: Choosing Among Options | publisher = The MIT Press | date = 2005 | location = | pages = | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 0-262-20153-4 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Page numbers are needed on all book sources, pls fill in for Tester --&gt; of solar power falls on the planet's surface. While it is not possible to capture all, or even most, of this energy, capturing less than 0.02% would be enough to meet the current energy needs. Barriers to further solar generation include the high price of making [[solar cells]] and reliance on weather patterns to generate electricity. Also, current solar generation does not produce electricity at night, which is a particular problem in high northern and southern latitude countries; energy demand is highest in winter, while availability of solar energy is lowest. This could be overcome by buying power from countries closer to the equator during winter months, and may also be addressed with technological developments such as the development of inexpensive energy storage. Globally, solar generation is the fastest growing source of energy, seeing an annual average growth of 35% over the past few years. [[Japan]], [[Europe]], [[China]], [[United States|U.S.]] and [[Solar power in India|India]] are the major growing investors in solar energy. Solar power's share of worldwide electricity usage at the end of 2014 was 1%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ren21.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/REN12-GSR2015_Onlinebook_low1.pdf pg31&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wind power===
{{Main article|Wind power}}
The available wind energy estimates range from 300&amp;nbsp;TW to 870&amp;nbsp;TW.&lt;ref name="Tester 2005"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gcep.stanford.edu/research/exergycharts.html Exergy Flow Charts]&lt;/ref&gt; Using the lower estimate, just 5% of the available wind energy would supply the current worldwide energy needs. Most of this wind energy is available over the open ocean. The [[ocean]]s cover 71% of the planet and wind tends to blow more strongly over open water because there are fewer obstructions.

===Wave and tidal power===
{{Main article|Wave power|Tidal power}}
At the end of 2005, 0.3&amp;nbsp;GW of electricity was produced by [[tidal power]].&lt;ref name="Renewables2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | format = PDF | publisher = Renewable Energy Policy Network for the 21st Century | title = Renewables, Global Status Report 2006 | date = 2006 | accessdate = 2007-04-03 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110718181410/http://www.ren21.net/globalstatusreport/download/RE_GSR_2006_Update.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the [[tidal forces]] created by the Moon (68%) and the Sun (32%), and the Earth's relative rotation with respect to Moon and Sun, there are fluctuating tides. These tidal fluctuations result in [[dissipation]] at an average rate of about 3.7 TW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0967-0637(98)00070-3 | volume=45 | title=Abyssal recipes II: energetics of tidal and wind mixing | year=1998 | journal=Deep Sea Research Part I: Oceanographic Research Papers | pages=1977–2010 | last1 = Munk | first1 = Walter| bibcode=1998DSRI...45.1977M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another physical limitation is the energy available in the tidal fluctuations of the oceans, which is about 0.6 EJ ([[exa]][[joule]]).&lt;ref&gt;Marchuk, G.I. and Kagan, B.A. (1989) "Dynamics of Ocean Tides", Kluwer Academic Publishers, {{ISBN|978-90-277-2552-3}}. See page 225.&lt;/ref&gt; Note this is only a tiny fraction of the total [[rotational energy|rotational energy of the Earth]]. Without forcing, this energy would be dissipated (at a dissipation rate of 3.7 TW) in about four [[Half|semi]]-[[Day|diurnal]] tide periods. So, dissipation plays a significant role in the tidal dynamics of the oceans. Therefore, this limits the available tidal energy to around 0.8 TW (20% of the dissipation rate) in order not to disturb the tidal dynamics too much. {{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

Waves are derived from wind, which is in turn derived from solar energy, and at each conversion there is a drop of about two orders of magnitude in available energy. The total power of waves that wash against the earth's shores adds up to 3 TW.&lt;ref&gt;Tester, et al., p. 593&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geothermal===
{{Main article|Geothermal power}}
Estimates of exploitable worldwide [[geothermal power|geothermal energy]] resources vary considerably, depending on assumed investments in technology and exploration and guesses about geological formations. According to a 1999 study, it was thought that this might amount to between 65 and 138&amp;nbsp;GW of electrical generation capacity 'using enhanced technology'.&lt;ref&gt;

A 2006 report by [[MIT]] that took into account the use of [[Enhanced Geothermal System]]s (EGS) concluded that it would be affordable to generate 100&amp;nbsp;GWe (gigawatts of electricity) or more by 2050, just in the [[United States]], for a maximum investment of 1 billion US dollars in research and development over 15 years.&lt;ref name="INEL"&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[MIT]] | title = The Future of Geothermal Energy | url = http://geothermal.inel.gov/publications/future_of_geothermal_energy.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate=2007-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MIT report calculated the world's total EGS resources to be over 13&amp;nbsp;YJ, of which over 200&amp;nbsp;ZJ would be extractable, with the potential to increase this to over 2&amp;nbsp;YJ with technology improvements - sufficient to provide all the world's energy needs for several [[Millennium|millennia]].&lt;ref name="INEL" /&gt; The total heat content of the Earth is 13,000,000 YJ.&lt;ref name="GEO" /&gt;

===Biomass===
{{Main article|biomass|biofuel}}
Production of biomass and biofuels are growing industries as interest in sustainable fuel sources is growing. Utilizing waste products avoids a [[food vs fuel]] trade-off, and burning [[Methane|methane gas]] reduces greenhouse gas emissions, because even though it releases carbon dioxide, carbon dioxide is 23 times less of a greenhouse gas than is methane. Biofuels represent a sustainable partial replacement for fossil fuels, but their net impact on [[greenhouse gas]] emissions depends on the agricultural practices used to grow the plants used as feedstock to create the fuels. While it is widely believed that biofuels can be carbon-neutral, there is evidence that biofuels produced by current farming methods are substantial net carbon emitters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Rosenthal | first=Elisabeth | title=Biofuels Deemed a Greenhouse Threat | newspaper=[[New York Times]] | date=2008-02-08 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/science/earth/08wbiofuels.html}} Registration required.
