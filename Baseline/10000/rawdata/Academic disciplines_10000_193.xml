      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4003">'''Antilabe''' (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ἀντι "mutually" or "corresponding", λαβή, "grip" or "handle") is a [[rhetoric]]al technique in [[verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]] or [[closet drama]], in which a single [[Line (poetry)|verse line]] of dialogue is distributed on two or more [[Character (arts)|characters]], voices, or entities. The verse usually maintains its [[Metre (poetry)|metric]] integrity, while the line fragments spoken by the characters may or may not be complete sentences. In the layout of the text the line fragments following the first one are often indented ("[[dropped line]]") to show the unity of the verse line.

{{Quotation|
'''BRUTUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
:Peace then. No words.
'''CLITUS''':&lt;br /&gt; 
::::::::I'll rather kill myself.|
[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]|[[Julius Caesar (play)|''Julius Caesar'']]}}

These are three sentences spoken by two persons. But it is only one single line in [[blank verse]]:

:Peace '''then'''. No '''words'''. I'll '''ra'''ther '''kill''' my'''self'''.

==In Ancient Greek drama==

"The device originated in [[tragedy|classical tragedy]] as a means of heightening dramatic tension."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, David. ''McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of World Drama''. Volume 1. 1972, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt; "It figures in almost all the plays of [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. It renders dialogue less stately and more agitated: the technique is well suited to scenes of excitement, in which one speaker is repeatedly capping, countering or following up the ideas of another."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, R. B. ''Greek Tragic Style: Form, Language and Interpretation''. Cambridge University Press, 2012, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; In Sophokles’ ''[[Oedipus Rex|Oedipus]]'', for example, "as ''Kreon'' seizes ''Antigone'' (832), they break into an excited lyrical strophe, full of ''antilabe'' in which ''Oedipus'', ''Kreon'', and the chorus participate."&lt;ref&gt;Edmunds, Lowell. ''Theatrical Space and Historical Place in Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus''. Maryland, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1996,  p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; "In ''[[Electra (Sophocles)|Electra]]'' (1502-3), ''antilabe'' occurs as ''Orestes'' tries to induce ''Aegisthys'' to enter the house so that ''Orestes'' can kill him."&lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, John E. Jr. ''The Facts on File Companion to Classical Drama''. Facts on File (Library of World Literature) 2005, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; "[Antilabe is] used with particular freedom in late Euripides."&lt;ref&gt;Rutherford, p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the plays of [[Aeschylus]], with the possible exception of ''[[Prometheus Bound]]'' (line 980), this phenomenon does not occur." &lt;ref&gt;Thorburn, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Seneca drama==

"Dialogic exchanges using both ''[[stichomythia]]'' and ''antilabe'' are common in [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. They occur in all the tragedies except ''Phoenissiae''."&lt;ref&gt;Boyle, A. J. ed. ''Seneca: Medea: Edited with Introduction, Translation, and Commentary''. Oxford University Press, 2014, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Renaissance drama==

David Eggenberger notes that "[the device] was frequently utilized by [[Renaissance]] dramatists."&lt;ref&gt;Eggenberger, p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

An extreme example from Shakespeare is:

{{Quotation|Death?
::My lord?
::::A grave.
::::::He shall not live.|''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'', 3.3}}

'''Antioch University''' is a [[private university|private]] [[non-profit]] [[university system]] in the United States with five campuses located in four states, as well as an online campus and the Graduate School of Leadership and Change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/gslc/|title=Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All campuses of the university are regionally accredited by the [[Higher Learning Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antioch.edu/our-accreditation/ Antioch University - Our Accreditation]&lt;/ref&gt; Campuses are located in [[Los Angeles, California]]; [[Santa Barbara, California]]; [[Keene, New Hampshire]]; [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]]; and [[Seattle, Washington]]. Antioch University uses the system of [[narrative evaluation]] as a substitute to the conventional grading system of A-F letter grades. Additionally, Antioch University houses two institution-wide programs, the PhD in Leadership and Change&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.antioch.edu/gslc/degrees-programs/business-management-leadership/phd-leadership-change/|title=PhD in Leadership &amp; Change {{!}} Antioch University {{!}} Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antioch Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/auonline/|title=Antioch University Online {{!}} A University in Pursuit of a Better World|website=www.antioch.edu/auonline|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While it originated from the historic college, Antioch University should not be confused with [[Antioch College]] in Yellow Springs, Ohio, which gained its independence from the University in 2009, and has since had no affiliation with the University.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2009/07/01/antioch Jaschik, Scott (July 1, 2009) "A Deal to Revive Antioch" Inside Higher Ed]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Antioch University serves more than 4,000 adult students around the world and across the country, online and from its five campuses in four states. The [[Los Angeles]] campus offers an MFA in creative writing; the [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] campus offers an MA in education with an emphasis in social justice; the [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] campus offers a program in conflict analysis; the [[Seattle]] campus offers integrative drama and art therapy programs; and the online campus offers a BA in Human Services Administration as well as a BA in [[Bachelor of Liberal Studies|Liberal Studies]] with various concentrations.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Background==
Antioch University grew out of Antioch College.  Antioch College was founded in 1852 as the result of American educator [[Horace Mann]]'s dream to establish a college comparable to [[Harvard University|Harvard]] but with some notable differences. Antioch College was to be completely nonsectarian and [[co-educational]], and with a curriculum that would include the traditional treatment of the classics, but would emphasize science and the scientific method, history, and modern literature. Students would not compete for grades but would be encouraged to pursue issues of interest to them, read what they considered worthwhile and present papers on topics of their own choosing. Horace Mann became the first president in 1853.

Antioch College began a period of rapid expansion in 1964 with the acquisition of the Putney School of Education in Vermont.  That campus has evolved and moved several times to become Antioch University New England now situated in Keene, NH. By 1972, another 23 centers had been opened, and the College By-Laws were revised to define Antioch as a "network", not a college. Even as centers began to close, new centers continued to open; 38 centers would be opened by the end of 1979, including the ABA-accredited Antioch School of Law located in Washington, D.C. In 1977, the Antioch College Board of Trustees voted to change its name to Antioch University, and in 1978, Antioch University Corporation replaced Antioch College Corporation as owner of all institutional assets, tangible and intangible.

In 1986, the University decided to close 32 of its units around the country, including the School of Law. The law school now operates as the University of the District of Columbia David A. Clarke School of Law. By 1989, the University consolidated to 6 campuses including 1) its original campus, Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio; 2) Antioch University New England in Keene New Hampshire; 3) Antioch University Los Angeles; 4) Antioch University Santa Barbara; 5) Antioch University Seattle; and 6) Antioch University McGregor, an adult, graduate degree program in Yellow Springs, Ohio, now known as Antioch University Midwest.

In 2008, citing financial exigency, Antioch University closed the Antioch College campus in Yellow Springs.  Antioch College alumni came together to found the Antioch College Continuation Corporation and purchased the College name and campus back from the University. The newly independent Antioch College reopened in 2011 and purchased its remaining assets back from the University in 2012.  Since then, Antioch University and Antioch College have operated as wholly separate, non-affiliated institutions, although the University continues to retain the transcripts of all College alumni who entered prior to the 2008 closure.

From its inception, racial and gender equality, independent study and independent thinking were integral parts of Antioch College. Six students were accepted for the first quarter: four men and two women who came to share the same college classrooms for the first time in the U.S. The notion of [[gender equality]] extended also to the faculty. Antioch College was the first U.S. college to designate a woman as full professor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/02/nation/na-hometown-antioch2|title=Antioch College alumni plan to save their school|author=P.J. Huffstutter | work=Los Angeles Times|date=September 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the original faculty included seven men and two women. Then, in 1863, the college instituted the policy that no applicant was to be rejected on the basis of race.

In the early 1850s, [[Rebecca Pennell]] offered a course on teaching methods which was the first of its kind, while [[John Burns Weston]], class of 1857, established a long-standing precedent by being both student and faculty simultaneously. He taught Greek language and literature for 20 years and remained a lifelong student.

While Antioch College never diverged from the philosophy of Horace Mann, the final form of an Antioch education traced its roots from the election of [[Arthur Ernest Morgan|Arthur Morgan]] as President of the college in 1920. Morgan, like Mann, believed in the development of the individual as a whole. Having seen the difficulty encountered by [[ivory-tower]] academicians attempting to participate in the business world, he resolved to change the cloistered educational experience by providing students with work experience in their field. He wrote “The Plan for the New Antioch” which was his vision for the future of the school. This was the beginning of Antioch's unique program of work and study, what Morgan termed, “industrial education.”

Morgan initiated the practice of [[student government]]. He also changed the nature of the admissions procedure. Rather than relying on [[entrance examination]]s, Morgan opted for more personal information on prospective students. In addition, senior exams were graded "honors" or "pass", and students who failed could retake the exam. Morgan remained at Antioch until 1933, when [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|President Roosevelt]] requested that he assume directorship of the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]] Project.

==College expansion and university founding==
In 1964, Antioch College took over the Putney School of Education in [[Vermont]] (now [[Antioch University New England]] in Keene, New Hampshire). During the next decade, other adult learning programs were instituted: among them, Antioch Seattle; Antioch Southern California with campuses in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara; and the Antioch Education Abroad Program (with centers in [[London]], Germany and other locations).

In 1978, Antioch College became a university system. From 1978 to 1994 the President of Antioch College also served as the Chancellor of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;http://antiochiana.edu/PresidentsList.htm{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, Antioch University's Ph.D. in Leadership and Change Program was founded. The program is designed to educate professionals from a wide range of fields to understand and lead organizational change. The program's low-residency model offers students interdisciplinary study with a practitioner focus that teaches and encourages applied research.

In 2009 Antioch College became entirely independent of Antioch University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ysnews.com/news/2009/09/antioch-college-alive-and-independent-again|title=Antioch College alive and independent again|author=Diane Chiddister}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campuses==

===Antioch University New England===
Founded in 1964, [[Antioch University New England]] is located in Keene, New Hampshire, a small city with a strong tradition of civic, cultural, and environmental activism, in the heart of the state's [[Monadnock Region]]. It is Antioch University's largest branch, with over 1,200 graduate-level students.  Master's degrees are awarded in areas of [[Mental Health Counselor|Clinical Mental Health Counseling]] (with specializations in Addictions Counseling &amp; Dance/Movement Therapy), [[Family Therapy|Marriage and Family Therapy]], [[Environmental Studies]], Organization &amp; Management ("Green MBA"), and Education.  Doctoral degrees are awarded in the areas of [[Clinical Psychology]] ([[Psy.D]]), Marriage and Family Therapy (Ph. D), and Environmental Studies (Ph. D).  Antioch-New England is one of only three schools in the United States to offer [[Waldorf education|Waldorf]] teacher training and has gained critical acclaim for its annually published environmental literary journal ''[[Whole Terrain]]''.

===Antioch University Los Angeles===
{{advert|date=August 2018}}
Established in 1972 and with more than 8,000 alumni, [[Antioch University Los Angeles]] serves the diverse communities of the greater [[Los Angeles]] area. The core values of [[social justice]], service to community, and [[lifelong learning]] comprise the heart of the BA degree completion program and master's degree programs in organizational management, education and teacher credentialing, psychology, and creative writing.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.antioch.edu/los-angeles&lt;/ref&gt; Partnerships with community organizations provide students with unique experiential learning opportunities. The low-residency MFA in creative writing was named among the top five programs in the nation by ''[[The Atlantic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2007/08/the-best-of-the-best/6049/&lt;/ref&gt; and the graduate clinical psychology specialization in [[LGBT]] studies is the first of its kind.  The MA in [[urban sustainability]] was developed in response to the growing awareness of the interconnections among environmental, economic, and social issues. The interdisciplinary program prepares well-trained, well-informed scholars, community leaders, and activists to advocate for sustainable urban policy and social change in the face of the growing global environmental crisis. The current student body consists of approximately 1000 learners, and supports a collection of faculty who are arguably in the top echelon of their fields. The school also offers a B.A. in Liberal Studies as well as Masters of Arts in Psychology, Organizational Management, and Urban Sustainability.

===Antioch University Midwest===
Founded in 1988, [[Antioch University Midwest]] (AUM) is located in Yellow Springs, Ohio. Antioch University Midwest offers bachelor's degrees in Humanities, Management, Human Development, Liberal Arts, Health and Wellness, and Human Service Administration through an academically intensive cohort model of on-campus classes offered in the evenings and on Saturdays. They also offer two online Certificates in Education, as well as an MBA with concentrations in healthcare leadership and change management. The MA in Individualized Liberal and Professional Studies provides a self-designed major where students work with Antioch University faculty as well as specialized academic professionals who agree to mentor the student through their studies. Many of the graduate programs are available with limited residency in an online format. Antioch University Midwest was previously known as Antioch University McGregor and was founded in 1988 as the School of Adult and Experiential Learning at Antioch College.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/antioch-university-mcgregor-changes-its-name-759064.html|title=Antioch University McGregor changes its name}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Antioch University Midwest]] (name changed June 12, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antioch University Santa Barbara===
Founded in 1977, [[Antioch University Santa Barbara]] enrolls approximately 270 adult students from Santa Barbara and surrounding counties, as well as assorted students from other regions of the United States and some foreign countries. The campus offers a BA in liberal studies with seven possible concentrations, MA in clinical psychology with two possible concentrations, a [[PsyD]] in clinical psychology, an MA in education and teaching credential program, and an MBA program, and a Women and Leadership Certificate program.

===Antioch University Seattle===
[[Antioch University Seattle]] (AUS), founded in 1975 in [[Seattle, Washington]], offers master's degrees, a BA completion program, and a Doctor of Clinical Psychology (PsyD). Between 800 and 1000 students attend AUS, with an average age of 35. The School of Applied Psychology, Counseling and Family Therapy is the largest and longest running program with close to 3,000 graduates since 1976. The School offers master's degrees in mental health counseling, integrative studies, child, couple and family therapy, art therapy and drama therapy in addition to the PsyD program. The Center for Programs in Education offers teacher preparation at the graduate level, plus a master's in education for experienced educators. The Center for Creative Change features a low-residency, interdisciplinary approach to learning and offers master's degrees in environment and community, management and leadership, organizational development, and whole systems design. The BA in Liberal Studies program attracts students who like an individualized approach to completing their undergraduate degree. Students can receive credit for life experience and may pursue subjects of particular interest to them.

==University-wide programs==

===Graduate School of Leadership and Change===
A low-residency, cross-sector PhD dedicated to engaging working professionals in the interdisciplinary study, research and practice of leading positive change in workplaces, schools, organizations, and communities, across the country and world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/gslc/|title=Antioch University Graduate School of Leadership and Change|website=www.antioch.edu/gslc|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antioch University Online===
Antioch University Online is a 100% online learning environment offering bachelor's completion degrees and graduate programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://antioch.edu/auonline/|title=Antioch University Online {{!}} A University in Pursuit of a Better World|website=www.antioch.edu/auonline|access-date=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antioch College separation and reorganization==
In June 2007, the Antioch University Board of Trustees announced that they would suspend operations of [[Antioch College]] the following year and that they intended to re-open the college in four years. It was their belief that four years would give the university the necessary time to develop and execute a plan for re-building Antioch College in a manner that would both honor its legacy and secure its future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100618232943/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/antioch/ |archive-date=2010-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was considerable controversy among members of the Antioch College alumni group and the administration, suggesting that the university should not close the college. During this time – 2007-2009 – two different organizations (the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] [NCA] and the [[American Association of University Professors]] [AAUP]) conducted audits and investigations into the university's actions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090916125129/http://www.aaup.org/AAUP/protect/academicfreedom/investrep/2009/Antioch.htm |archive-date=2009-09-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with a response from the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.antioch.edu/AAUP.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100917070006/http://antioch.edu/AAUP.html |archive-date=2010-09-17 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, a group of Antioch College alumni, headed by the Antioch College Alumni Board, expressed interest in purchasing the college from the university and re-opening the college as an independent institution. The alumni group formed the Antioch College Continuation Corporation as the vehicle for negotiating and owning the college. After two years of negotiations, the parties agreed to terms and, on September 4, 2009, the parties conducted a signing ceremony that ratified their agreement. [[Mark Roosevelt]], a well-known senior education administrator, previously the superintendent of [[Pittsburgh Public Schools]], was appointed President. A reopened and separate Antioch College welcomed its first class of students in the fall of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.daytondailynews.com/news/dayton-news/reopening-antioch-college-would-set-historic-precedent-1074650.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Western art history}}

The '''art of Europe''', or '''Western art''', encompasses the history of [[visual art]] in [[Europe]]. European [[prehistoric art]] started as mobile [[rock art|rock]] and [[cave painting]] art and was characteristic of the period between the [[Paleolithic]] and the [[Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="Europeart"&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterbeek|first=Luíz|title=European Prehistoric Art|url=http://www.europreart.net/|work=Europeart|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Written histories of European art often begin with the art of the [[Ancient Middle East]] and the [[Aegean civilisation|Ancient Aegean civilization]]s, dating from the 3rd millennium BC. Parallel with these significant cultures, art of one form or another existed all over Europe, wherever there were people, leaving signs such as carvings, decorated artifacts and huge standing stones. However a consistent pattern of artistic development within Europe becomes clear only with the [[Ancient Greek art|art of Ancient Greece]], adopted and transformed by [[Roman art|Rome]] and carried; with the Empire, across much of Europe, [[North Africa]] and the [[Middle East]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boardman (art historian)|Boardman, John]] ed., ''The Oxford History of Classical Art'', pp. 349-369, [[Oxford University Press]], 1993, {{ISBN|0198143869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the art of the [[Classical antiquity|Classical period]] waxed and waned throughout the next two thousand years, seeming to slip into a distant memory in parts of the [[Medieval art|Medieval]] period, to re-emerge in the [[Renaissance]], suffer a period of what some early art historians viewed as "decay" during the [[Baroque]] period,&lt;ref&gt;[[Banister Fletcher]] excluded nearly all Baroque buildings from his mammoth tome ''A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method''. The publishers eventually rectified this.&lt;/ref&gt; to reappear in a refined form in [[Neo-Classicism]]&lt;ref name=mur&gt;Murray, P. and Murray, L. (1963) ''The Art of the Renaissance''. London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]] (World of Art), p. 9. {{ISBN|978-0-500-20008-7}}.  "...in 1855 we find, for the first time, the word 'Renaissance' used — by the French historian Michelet — as an adjective to describe a whole period of history and not confined to the rebirth of Latin letters or a classically inspired style in the arts."&lt;/ref&gt; and to be reborn in [[Post-Modernism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hause, S. &amp; Maltby, W. (2001). ''A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization'' (Vol. 2, pp. 245–246). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the 1800s, the Christian church was a major influence upon European art, the commissions of the Church, architectural, painterly and sculptural, providing the major source of work for artists. The history of the Church was very much reflected in the history of art, during this period. In the same period of time there was renewed interest in heroes and heroines, tales of mythological gods and goddesses, great wars, and bizarre creatures which were not connected to religion.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Europe|url=http://www.slam.org/european/intro.html|work=Saint Louis Art Museum|publisher=Slam|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most art of the last 200 years has been produced without reference to religion and often with no particular [[ideology]] at all, but art has often been influenced by political issues, whether reflecting the concerns of patrons or the artist.

European art is arranged into a number of stylistic periods, which, historically, overlap each other as different styles flourished in different areas. Broadly the periods are, [[classical antiquity|Classical]], [[Byzantine]], [[Medieval]], [[Gothic art|Gothic]], [[Renaissance]], [[Baroque]], [[Rococo]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]], [[Modernism|Modern]] and [[Postmodern]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"/&gt;

==Prehistoric art==
{{main article|Prehistoric_art#Europe}}

European prehistoric art is an important part of the European cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Oosterbeek|first=Luíz|title=European Prehistoric Art|url=http://www.europreart.net/prese.htm|work=Europeart|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prehistoric art history is usually divided into four main periods: [[Stone age]], [[Neolithic]], [[Bronze age]], and [[Iron age]]. Most of the remaining artifacts of this period are small sculptures and cave paintings.

[[File:Venus of Willendorf frontview retouched 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Venus of Willendorf]].]]
Much surviving [[prehistoric art]] is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female [[Venus figurines]] such as the [[Venus of Willendorf]] (24,000–22,000 BC) found across central Europe;&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 8-16, 29-31&lt;/ref&gt; the 30&amp;nbsp;cm tall [[Löwenmensch figurine]] of about 30,000 BCE has hardly any pieces that can be related to it.  The [[Swimming Reindeer]] of about 11,000 BCE is one of the finest of a number of [[Magdalenian]] carvings in bone or antler of animals in the [[art of the Upper Paleolithic]], though they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Joachim, "Prehistoric Europe, §II: Palaeolithic 3. Portable art" in [[Oxford Art Online]], accessed August 24, 2012; Sandars, 37-40&lt;/ref&gt; With the beginning of the [[Mesolithic]] in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced,&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 75-80&lt;/ref&gt; and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the [[Gundestrup cauldron]] from the [[European Iron Age]] and the Bronze Age [[Trundholm sun chariot]].&lt;ref&gt;Sandars, 253-257, 183-185&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest European cave art dates back 40,800, and can be found in the [[El Castillo Cave]] in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kwong|first=Matt|title=Oldest cave-man art in Europe dates back 40,800 years|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/story/2012/06/14/cave-paintings-europe.html|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other cave painting sites include [[Lascaux]], [[Cave of Altamira]], [[Grotte de Cussac]], [[Pech Merle]], [[Cave of Niaux]], [[Chauvet Cave]], [[Font-de-Gaume]], Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England, (Cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), [[Coliboaia cave]] from [[Romania]] (considered the oldest cave painting in central [[Europe]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/sciencenow/2010/06/romanian-cave-may-boast-central.html |title=Romanian Cave May Boast Central Europe's Oldest Cave Art &amp;#124; Science/AAAS &amp;#124; News |publisher=News.sciencemag.org |date=2010-06-21 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Magura,&lt;ref name="Europeart" /&gt; Belogradchik, Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art of Prehistoric Europe|last=Gunther|first=Michael|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/timelines/europe/prehistoric.html|accessdate=4 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of erosion.  One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland. When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Altamira cave, Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes.  Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry of Upper Palaeolithic peoples.  Cave paintings, undertaken with only the most rudimentary tools, can also furnish valuable insight into the culture and beliefs of that era.

The [[Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin]] represents a very different style, with the human figure the main focus, often seen in large groups, with battles, dancing and hunting all represented, as well as other activities and details such as clothing.  The figures are generally rather sketchily depicted in thin paint, with the relationships between the groups of humans and animals more carefully depicted than individual figures. Other less numerous groups of rock art, many engraved rather than painted, show similar characteristics. The Iberian examples are believed to date from a long period perhaps covering the Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and early Neolithic.

Prehistoric [[Celtic art]] comes from much of [[Iron Age Europe]] and survives mainly in the form of high-status metalwork skillfully decorated with complex, elegant and mostly abstract designs, often using curving and spiral forms. There are human heads and some fully represented animals, but full-length human figures at any size are so rare that their absence may represent a religious taboo.  As the Romans conquered Celtic territories, it almost entirely vanishes, but the style continued in limited use in the [[British Isles]], and with the coming of Christianity revived there in the [[Insular style]] of the Early Middle Ages.

==Ancient Classical art==
{{Main article|Minoan art|Ancient Greek art|Roman art}}
[[File:Minoan Ceramic - Can.jpg|thumb|upright|Minoan Ceramic Art]]

The [[Minoan culture]] is regarded as the oldest civilization in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Chaniotis|first=Angelos|title=Ancient Crete|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780195389661/obo-9780195389661-0071.xml;jsessionid=B732A8D81DF46C77A25A3DA2625360A9|work=Oxford Bibliographies|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Minoan culture existed in [[Crete]] and consisted of four periods: Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial, and the Postpalatial period between 3650 BC and 1100 BC. Not much of the art remained from the Prepalatial times, and most of artefacts still existing today are Cycladic [[statuettes]] and [[pottery]] fragments. The most prosperous period of the Cretan civilization was Neopalatial period and most of the artefacts are from this era. A large number of artefacts from the Protopalatial can be seen today in Cretan museums.
Pottery – most popular in the Protopalatial period (1900-1700 BC) – was characterized by thin walled vessels, subtle, symmetrical shapes, elegant spouts, and decorations, and dynamic lines. Dark and light values were often contrasted in Minoan pottery.  The spontaneity and fluidity of the Protopalatial period later were transformed to a more stylized form of art with dissociation of naturalism in the Neopalatial period.&lt;br /&gt;The [[palace]]s served as organizational, commercial, artistic, worshipping, and agricultural centres in the Cretan civilization. Cretan palaces were built without defensive walls and exhibited a central [[courtyard]] which was embraced by a number of buildings. The central courtyard served as the main meeting place of the people. The palaces had [[throne room]]s, cult chambers, and [[theatre]]s where people could gather at special events. Columns and staircases were part of the artistic expression and it is believed that they served as metaphorical elements.&lt;br /&gt;The Minoan palaces are richly painted with [[painting]]s. Minoan painting was unique in that it used wet fresco techniques; it was characterized by small waists, fluidity, and vitality of the figures and was seasoned with elasticity, spontaneity, vitality, and high-contrasting colours.&lt;br /&gt;Not much of the [[sculpture]] survived from the Minoan civilization. The best known example of sculptures is the [[Snake Goddess]] figurine. The sculpture depicts a goddess or a high priestess holding a snake in both hands, dressed in traditional Minoan attire, cloth covering the whole body and leaving the breasts exposed. Exquisite [[metal work]] was also a characteristic of the Minoan art. Minoan metal masters worked with imported gold and copper and mastered techniques of wax casting, [[Embossing (manufacturing)|embossing]], [[gilding]], nielo, and [[Granulation (jewellery)|granulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Minoan art|url=http://www.ancient-greece.org/art/minoan-art.html|work=Greek art|publisher=Ancient-Greece.org|accessdate=2 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Art of Ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]] had great painters, great sculptors, and great architects. The [[Parthenon]] is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek [[marble sculpture]] is often described as the highest form of [[classicism|Classical]] art.  Painting on the [[pottery of Ancient Greece]] and [[Ceramic art|ceramics]] gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. [[Black-figure vase painting]] and [[Red-figure vase painting]] gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are [[Apelles]], [[Zeuxis and Parrhasius]], however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or by later Romans.  Zeuxis lived in 5–6 BC and was said to be the first to use [[sfumato]]. According to [[Pliny the Elder]], the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes.  Apelles is described as the greatest painter of [[classical antiquity|Antiquity]] for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

[[File:Fayum-34.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Mummy portrait of a young girl, 2nd century AD, [[Louvre]].]]

[[Roman art]] was influenced by Greece and can in part be taken as a descendant of ancient Greek painting and sculpture, but was also strongly influenced by the more local [[Etruscan art]] of Italy. [[Roman sculpture]], is primarily portraiture derived from the upper classes of society as well as depictions of the gods. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics.  Among surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in [[Campania]], in Southern Italy, especially at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. Such painting can be grouped into four main "styles" or periods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.art-and-archaeology.com/roman/painting.html |title=Roman Painting |publisher=Art-and-archaeology.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may contain the first examples of [[trompe-l'oeil]], pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roman Painting|url=http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/ropt/hd_ropt.htm|work=Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History|publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the surviving painted portraits from the Ancient world are a large number of [[Fayum mummy portraits|coffin-portrait]]s of bust form found in the [[Late Antique]] cemetery of [[Al-Fayum]].  They give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had.  A very small number of [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniatures]] from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period. [[Early Christian art]] grew out of Roman popular, and later Imperial, art and adapted its [[iconography]] from these sources.

==Medieval==
{{main article|Medieval art}}

[[File:Meister des Book of Lindisfarne 001.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|''[[Saint Matthew]]'' from the ''[[Lindisfarne Gospels]].]]

Most surviving art from the [[Medieval]] period was religious in focus, often funded by the [[Roman Catholic Church|Church]], powerful ecclesiastical individuals such as [[bishop]]s, communal groups such as [[abbey]]s, or wealthy secular [[patron]]s. Many had specific liturgical functions—processional [[Christian cross|crosses]] and [[altarpiece]]s, for example.

One of the central questions about Medieval art concerns its lack of realism. A great deal of knowledge of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]] in art and understanding of the human figure was lost with the fall of [[Roman Empire|Rome]]. But realism was not the primary concern of Medieval artists. They were simply trying to send a religious message, a task which demands clear iconic images instead of precisely rendered ones.

'''Time Period''': 6th century to 15th century

===Byzantine===
[[File:Helios in His Chariot.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
{{main article|Byzantine art}}
Byzantine art overlaps with or merges with what we call Early Christian art until the [[iconoclasm]] period of 730-843 when the vast majority of artwork with figures was destroyed; so little remains that today any discovery sheds new understanding. After 843 until 1453 there is a clear Byzantine art tradition. It is often the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with production centered on Constantinople. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental frescos and mosaics inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to mosques.

===Early Medieval art===
[[File:KellsFol292rIncipJohn.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
[[Migration period art]] is a general term for the art of the "barbarian" peoples who moved into formerly Roman territories.  [[Celtic art]] in the 7th and 8th centuries saw a fusion with Germanic traditions through contact with the [[Anglo-Saxons]] creating what is called the Hiberno-Saxon style or [[Insular art]], which was to be highly influential on the rest of the Middle Ages.  [[Merovingian art]] describes the art of the [[Franks]] before about 800, when [[Carolingian art]] combined insular influences with a self-conscious classical revival, developing into [[Ottonian art]]. [[Anglo-Saxon art]] is the art of England after the Insular period.  [[Illuminated manuscript]]s contain nearly all the surviving painting of the period, but architecture, metalwork and small carved work in wood or ivory were also important media.

{{main article|Romanesque art}}
Romanesque art refers to the period from about 1000 to the rise of Gothic art in the 12th century.  This was a period of increasing prosperity, and the first to see a coherent style used across Europe, from Scandinavia to Switzerland.  Romanesque art is vigorous and direct, was originally brightly coloured, and is often very sophisticated. [[Stained glass]] and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] on metalwork became important media, and larger sculptures in the round developed, although [[high relief]] was the principal technique.  Its architecture is dominated by thick walls, and round-headed windows and arches, with much carved decoration.

===Gothic===
[[File:Folio 79r - Pentecostes excerpt.jpg|frameless|left|upright=0.45]]
{{main article|Gothic art}}
Gothic art is a variable term depending on the craft, place and time. The term originated with Gothic architecture in 1140, but Gothic painting did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style. Gothic sculpture was born in France in 1144 with the renovation of the Abbey Church of S. Denis and spread throughout Europe, by the 13th century it had become the international style, replacing Romanesque. International Gothic describes Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art merges into Renaissance art at different times in different places. During this period forms such as painting, in fresco and on panel, become newly important, and the end of the period includes new media such as prints. {{Clear}}

{{main article|Renaissance art}}
The [[Renaissance]] is characterized by a focus on the arts of [[Ancient Greece]] and [[Roman Empire|Rome]], which led to many changes in both the technical aspects of painting and sculpture, as well as to their subject matter. It began in [[Italian Renaissance|Italy]], a country rich in Roman heritage as well as material prosperity to fund artists. During the Renaissance, painters began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], thus representing three [[dimension]]s more authentically. Artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of [[Titian]]'s portraits and the development of [[sfumato]] and [[chiaroscuro]] by [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. [[Sculpture|Sculptors]], too, began to rediscover many ancient techniques such as [[contrapposto]]. Following with the [[Humanism|humanist]] spirit of the age, art became more secular in subject matter, depicting ancient [[mythology]] in addition to Christian themes. This genre of art is often referred to as [[Renaissance Classicism]]. In the North, the most important Renaissance innovation was the widespread use of [[oil paint]]s, which allowed for greater colour and intensity.

===From Gothic to the Renaissance===
During the late 13th century and early 14th century, much of the painting in Italy was Byzantine in Character, notably that of [[Duccio]] of Siena and [[Cimabue]] of Florence, while [[Pietro Cavallini]] in [[Rome]] was more [[Gothic art|Gothic]] in style.

In 1290 [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] began painting in a manner that was less traditional and more based upon observation of nature. His famous cycle at the [[Scrovegni Chapel]], [[Padua]], is seen as the beginnings of a Renaissance style.

Other painters of the 14th century were carried the Gothic style to great elaboration and detail. Notable among these painters are [[Simone Martini]] and [[Gentile da Fabriano]].

In the [[Netherlands]], the technique of painting in [[oil paint|oil]]s rather than [[tempera]], led itself to a form of elaboration that was not dependent upon the application of gold leaf and embossing, but upon the minute depiction of the natural world. The art of painting textures with great realism evolved at this time. Dutch painters such as [[Jan van Eyck]] and [[Hugo van der Goes]] were to have great influence on Late Gothic and Early Renaissance painting.

===Early Renaissance===
The ideas of the Renaissance first emerged in the city-state of [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. The sculptor [[Donatello]] returned to classical techniques such as [[contrapposto]] and classical subjects like the unsupported nude—his second sculpture of ''[[Donatello's David|David]]'' was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire. The sculptor and architect [[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]] studied the architectural ideas of ancient Roman buildings for inspiration. [[Tommaso Masaccio|Masaccio]] perfected elements like composition, individual expression, and human form to paint frescoes, especially those in the [[Brancacci Chapel]], of surprising elegance, drama, and emotion.

A remarkable number of these major artists worked on different portions of the [[Florence Cathedral]]. Brunelleschi's dome for the cathedral was one of the first truly revolutionary architectural innovations since the Gothic flying buttress. Donatello created many of its sculptures. Giotto and [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]] also contributed to the cathedral.

===High Renaissance===
High Renaissance artists include such figures as [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], and [[Raffaello Sanzio]].

The 15th-century artistic developments in Italy (for example, the interest in perspectival systems, in depicting anatomy, and in classical cultures) matured during the 16th century, accounting for the designations "Early Renaissance" for the 15th century and "High Renaissance" for the 16th century. Although no singular style characterizes the High Renaissance, the art of those most closely associated with this Period—Leonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian—exhibits an astounding mastery, both technical and aesthetic. High Renaissance artists created works of such authority that generations of later artists relied on these artworks for instruction.
These exemplary artistic creations further elevated the prestige of artists. Artists could claim divine inspiration, thereby raising visual art to a status formerly given only to poetry. Thus, painters, sculptors, and architects came into their own, successfully claiming for their work a high position among the fine arts. In a sense, 16th- century masters created a new profession with its own rights of expression and its own venerable character.

===Northern art up to the Renaissance===
[[Early Netherlandish painting]] developed (but did not strictly invent) the technique of [[oil painting]] to allow greater control in painting minute detail with realism—[[Jan van Eyck]]&amp;nbsp;(1366–1441) was a figure in the movement from [[illuminated manuscript]]s to [[panel painting]]s.

[[Hieronymus Bosch]] (1450?–1516), a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter, is another important figure in the Northern Renaissance. In his paintings, he used religious themes, but combined them with grotesque fantasies, colourful imagery, and peasant folk legends. His paintings often reflect the confusion and anguish associated with the end of the Middle Ages.

[[Albrecht Dürer]] introduced Italian Renaissance style to Germany at the end of the 15th century, and dominated [[German Renaissance art]].

In European art, Renaissance Classicism spawned two different movements—[[Mannerism]] and the [[Baroque]]. Mannerism, a reaction against the idealist perfection of Classicism, employed distortion of light and spatial frameworks in order to emphasize the emotional content of a painting and the emotions of the painter. The work of [[El Greco]] is a particularly clear example of [[Mannerism]] in painting during the late 16th, early 17th centuries. [[Northern Mannerism]] took longer to develop, and was largely a movement of the last half of the 16th century.   Baroque art took the representationalism of the Renaissance to new heights, emphasizing detail, movement, lighting, and drama in their search for beauty. Perhaps the best known Baroque painters are [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], [[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], and [[Diego Velázquez]].

A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th-century [[Dutch Golden Age painting]], which had very little religious art, and little [[history painting]], instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as [[still life]], [[genre painting]]s of everyday scenes, and [[landscape painting]].  While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for [[Vermeer]] and many other Dutch artists.  [[Flemish Baroque painting]] shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories.

Baroque art is often seen as part of the [[Counter-Reformation]]—the artistic element of the revival of spiritual life in the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Additionally, the emphasis that Baroque art placed on grandeur is seen as [[Political absolutism|Absolutist]] in nature. Religious and political themes were widely explored within the Baroque artistic context, and both paintings and sculptures were characterised by a strong element of drama, emotion and theatricality. Famous Baroque artists include [[Caravaggio]] or [[Rubens]].&lt;ref name="arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com/BaroqueArt.html |title=Baroque Art |publisher=Arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com |date=2013-07-24 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Baroque art was particularly ornate and elaborate in nature, often using rich, warm colours with dark undertones. Pomp and grandeur were important elements of the Baroque artistic movement in general, as can be seen when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] said, "I am grandeur incarnate"; many Baroque artists served kings who tried to realize this goal. Baroque art in many ways was similar to Renaissance art; as a matter of fact, the term was initially used in a derogative manner to describe post-Renaissance art and architecture which was over-elaborate.&lt;ref name="arthistory-famousartists-paintings.com"/&gt; Baroque art can be seen as a more elaborate and dramatic re-adaptation of late Renaissance art.

By the 18th century, however, Baroque art was falling out of fashion as many deemed it too melodramatic and also gloomy, and it developed into the [[Rococo]], which emerged in France. Rococo art was even more elaborate than the Baroque, but it was less serious and more playful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/avp/cas/his/CoreArt/art/ancien.html |title=Ancien Regime Rococo |publisher=Bc.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whilst the Baroque used rich, strong colours, Rococo used pale, creamier shades. The artistic movement no longer placed an emphasis on politics and religion, focusing instead on lighter themes such as romance, celebration, and appreciation of nature. Rococo art also contrasted the Baroque as it often refused symmetry in favor of asymmetrical designs. Furthermore, it sought inspiration from the artistic forms and ornamentation of [[Far East|Far Eastern Asia]], resulting in the rise in favour of [[porcelain]] figurines and [[chinoiserie]] in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/chinoiserie.aspx#3-1E1:chinoise-full|title=chinoiserie facts, information, pictures - Encyclopedia.com articles about chinoiserie|author=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 18th-century style flourished for a short while; nevertheless, the Rococo style soon fell out of favor, being seen by many as a gaudy and superficial movement emphasizing aesthetics over meaning. [[Neoclassicism]] in many ways developed as a counter movement of the Rococo, the impetus being a sense of disgust directed towards the latter's florid qualities.

==Neoclassicism, Romanticism, Academism and Realism==
{{Main article|Neoclassicism|Romantic art|Academic art|Realism (arts)}}
[[File:Amor-Psyche-Canova-JBU01.JPG|thumb|right|Neoclassical art, inspired by different classical themes, was characterised by an emphasis on simplicity, order and idealism. In the image [[Antonio Canova]]'s ''[[Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss]]'' (1787-1793)]]

Throughout the 18th century, a counter movement opposing the Rococo sprang up in different parts of Europe, commonly known as [[Neoclassicism]]. It despised the perceived superficiality and frivolity of Rococo art, and desired for a return to the simplicity, order and 'purism' of classical antiquity, especially ancient Greece and Rome. The movement was in part also influenced by the Renaissance, which itself was strongly influenced by classical art. Neoclassicism was the artistic component of the intellectual movement known as [[the Enlightenment]]; the Enlightenment was idealistic, and put its emphasis on objectivity, reason and empirical truth. Neoclassicism had become widespread in Europe throughout the 18th century, especially in the [[United Kingdom]], which saw great works of Neoclassical architecture spring up during this period; Neoclassicism's fascination with classical antiquity can be seen in the popularity of the [[Grand Tour]] during this decade, where wealthy aristocrats travelled to the ancient ruins of Italy and Greece. Nevertheless, a defining moment for Neoclassicism came during the [[French Revolution]] in the late 18th century; in France, Rococo art was replaced with the preferred Neoclassical art, which was seen as more serious than the former movement. In many ways, Neoclassicism can be seen as a political movement as well as an artistic and cultural one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artsz.org/neoclassicism-art/ |title=Art in Neoclassicism |publisher=Artsz.org |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neoclassical art places an emphasis on order, symmetry and classical simplicity; common themes in Neoclassical art include courage and war, as were commonly explored in ancient Greek and Roman art. [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Antonio Canova|Canova]], and [[Jacques-Louis David]] are among the best-known neoclassicists.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;James J. Sheehan, "Art and Its Publics, c. 1800," United and Diversity in European Culture c. 1800, ed. [[Tim Blanning]] and [[Hagen Schulze]] (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Eugène Delacroix - La liberté guidant le peuple.jpg|thumb|[[Eugène Delacroix]], ''[[Liberty Leading the People]]'' 1830, [[Romanticism|Romantic art]].]] 

Just as Mannerism rejected Classicism, so did [[Romanticism]] reject the ideas of the Enlightenment and the aesthetic of the Neoclassicists. Romanticism rejected the highly objective and ordered nature of Neoclassicism, and opted for a more individual and emotional approach to the arts.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cla.purdue.edu/english/theory/postmodernism/modules/introduction.html |title=General Introduction to Postmodernism |publisher=Cla.purdue.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romanticism placed an emphasis on nature, especially when aiming to portray the power and beauty of the natural world, and emotions, and sought a highly personal approach to art. Romantic art was about individual feelings, not common themes, such as in Neoclassicism; in such a way, Romantic art often used colours in order to express feelings and emotion.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; Similarly to Neoclassicism, Romantic art took much of its inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art and mythology, yet, unlike Neoclassical, this inspiration was primarily used as a way to create symbolism and imagery. Romantic art also takes much of its aesthetic qualities from [[medieval]]ism and [[Gothic art|Gothic]]ism, as well as mythology and [[folklore]]. Among the greatest Romantic artists were [[Eugène Delacroix]], [[Francisco Goya]], [[J.M.W. Turner]], [[John Constable]], [[Caspar David Friedrich]], [[Thomas Cole]], and [[William Blake]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt;

Most artists attempted to take a centrist approach which adopted different features of Neoclassicist and Romanticist styles, in order to synthesize them. The different attempts took place within the French Academy, and collectively are called [[Academic art]]. [[Adolphe William Bouguereau]] is considered a chief example of this stream of art.

In the early 19th century the face of Europe, however, became radically altered by [[industrialization]]. Poverty, squalor, and desperation were to be the fate of the new [[working class]] created by the "revolution". In response to these changes going on in society, the movement of [[realism (arts)|Realism]] emerged. Realism sought to accurately portray the conditions and hardships of the poor in the hopes of changing society. In contrast with Romanticism, which was essentially optimistic about mankind, Realism offered a stark vision of poverty and despair. Similarly, while Romanticism glorified nature, Realism portrayed life in the depths of an urban wasteland. Like Romanticism, [[Realism (arts)|Realism]] was a literary as well as an artistic movement. The great [[Realism (visual arts)|Realist]] painters include [[Jean-Baptiste-Siméon Chardin]], [[Gustave Courbet]], [[Jean-François Millet]], [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Camille Corot]], [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Édouard Manet]], [[Edgar Degas]] (both considered as [[Impressionism|Impressionist]]s), and [[Thomas Eakins]], among others.

The response of architecture to industrialisation, in stark contrast to the other arts, was to veer towards historicism. Although the railway stations built during this period are often considered the truest reflections of its spirit – they are sometimes called "the cathedrals of the age" – the main movements in architecture during the Industrial Age were revivals of styles from the distant past, such as the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]. Related movements were the [[Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood]], who attempted to return art to its state of "purity" prior to [[Raphael]], and the [[Arts and Crafts Movement]], which reacted against the impersonality of mass-produced goods and advocated a return to medieval craftsmanship.

==Modern art==
{{main article|Impressionism|Post Impressionism|Fauvism|Cubism|Modern art|Modernism|Late modernism}}
[[File:Monet Houses of Parliament, Sunset.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|right|Impressionism was known for its usage of light and movement in its paintings, as in [[Claude Monet]]'s 1902 ''[[Houses of Parliament (Monet series)|Houses of Parliament, sunset]]]]''
[[File:Art-LanguageV3No1-1974.jpg|thumb|right|[[Art &amp; Language]] are known for their major input on conceptual art.|299x299px]]
Out of the naturalist ethic of Realism grew a major artistic movement, [[Impressionism]]. The Impressionists pioneered the use of light in painting as they attempted to capture light as seen from the human eye. [[Edgar Degas]],
[[Édouard Manet]], [[Claude Monet]], [[Camille Pissarro]], and [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], were all involved in the Impressionist movement. As a direct outgrowth of Impressionism came the development of [[Post-Impressionism]]. [[Paul Cézanne]], [[Vincent van Gogh]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Georges Seurat]] are the best known Post-Impressionists.

Following the Impressionists and the [[Post-Impressionists]] came [[Fauvism]], often considered the first "modern" genre of art. Just as the Impressionists revolutionized light, so did the fauvists rethink [[color]], painting their canvases in bright, wild hues. After the Fauvists, [[modern art]] began to develop in all its forms, ranging from [[Expressionism]], concerned with evoking emotion through objective works of art, to [[Cubism]], the art of transposing a three-dimensional reality onto a flat canvas, to [[Abstract art]]. These new art forms pushed the limits of traditional notions of "art" and corresponded to the similar rapid changes that were taking place in human society, technology, and thought.

[[Surrealism]] is often classified as a form of Modern Art. However, the Surrealists themselves have objected to the study of surrealism as an era in art history, claiming that it oversimplifies the complexity of the movement (which they say is not an artistic movement), misrepresents the relationship of surrealism to [[aesthetics]], and falsely characterizes ongoing surrealism as a finished, historically encapsulated era. Other forms of Modern art (some of which border on [[Contemporary art]]) include:

{{Main article|Contemporary art|Postmodern art}}
Modern art foreshadowed several characteristics of what would later be defined as postmodern art; as a matter of fact, several modern art movements can often be classified as both modern and postmodern, such as [[pop art]]. Postmodern art, for instance, places a strong emphasis on irony, parody and humour in general; modern art started to develop a more ironic approach to art which would later advance in a postmodern context. Postmodern art sees the blurring between the high and fine arts with low-end and commercial art; modern art started to experiment with this blurring.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt;
Recent developments in art have been characterised by a significant expansion of what can now deemed to be art, in terms of materials, media, activity and concept. [[Conceptual art]] in particular has had a wide influence. This started literally as the replacement of concept for a made object, one of the intentions of which was to refute the commodification of art. However, it now usually refers to an artwork where there is an object, but the main claim for the work is made for the thought process that has informed it. The aspect of commercialism has returned to the work.

There has also been an increase in art referring to previous movements and artists, and gaining validity from that reference.

[[Postmodernism]] in art, which has grown since the 1960s, differs from [[Modernism]] in as much as Modern art movements were primarily focused on their own activities and values, while Postmodernism uses the whole range of previous movements as a reference point. This has by definition generated a relativistic outlook, accompanied by irony and a certain disbelief in values, as each can be seen to be replaced by another. Another result of this has been the growth of commercialism and celebrity. Postmodern art has questioned common rules and guidelines of what is regarded as '[[fine art]]', merging [[low culture|low art]] with the fine arts until none is fully distinguishable.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'', Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s] John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; Before the advent of postmodernism, the fine arts were characterised by a form of aesthetic quality, elegance, craftsmanship, finesse and intellectual stimulation which was intended to appeal to the [[upper class|upper]] or educated classes; this distinguished high art from low art, which, in turn, was seen as tacky, [[kitsch]], easily made and lacking in much or any intellectual stimulation, art which was intended to appeal to the masses. Postmodern art blurred these distinctions, bringing a strong element of kitsch, commercialism and [[camp (style)|campness]] into contemporary fine art;&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; what is nowadays seen as fine art may have been seen as low art before postmodernism revolutionised the concept of what high or fine art truly is.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt; In addition, the postmodern nature of contemporary art leaves a lot of space for individualism within the art scene; for instance, postmodern art often takes inspiration from past artistic movements, such as Gothic or Baroque art, and both juxtaposes and recycles styles from these past periods in a different context.&lt;ref name="cla.purdue.edu"/&gt;

Some [[Surrealism|surrealist]]s in particular [[Joan Miró]], who called for the "murder of painting" (In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Miró expressed contempt for conventional painting methods and his desire to "kill", "murder", or "rape" them in favor of more contemporary means of expression).&lt;ref&gt;M. Rowell, ''Joan Mirό: Selected Writings and Interviews'' (London: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], 1987) pp. 114–116.&lt;/ref&gt;  have denounced or attempted to "supersede" painting, and there have also been other anti-painting trends among artistic movements, such as that of [[Dada]] and [[conceptual art]]. The trend away from painting in the late 20th century has been countered by various movements, for example the continuation of [[Minimal Art]], [[Lyrical Abstraction]], [[Pop Art]], [[Op Art]], [[New Realism]], [[Photorealism]], [[Neo-minimalism|Neo Geo]], [[Neo-expressionism]], and [[Stuckism]] and various other important and influential painterly directions.

{{Politics}}

'''Biopower''' (or ''biopouvoir'' in French) is a term coined by French [[scholar]], [[historian]], and [[social theorist]] [[Michel Foucault]]. It relates to the practice of modern [[nation states]] and their regulation of their subjects through "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugations of bodies and the [[control of populations]]".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1 p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault first used the term in his lecture courses at the [[Collège de France]],&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Security, Territory, Population: Lectures at the Collège de France 1977&amp;ndash;1978'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4; see notes on p.&amp;nbsp;24, notes&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;4 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault: ''Society Must Be Defended'' Lectures at the Collège de France 1975&amp;ndash;1976 p.&amp;nbsp;243 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; but the term first appeared in print in ''The Will To Knowledge'', Foucault's first volume of ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault, (1998) ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; In Foucault's work, it has been used to refer to practices of public health, regulation of heredity, and risk regulation, among many other regulatory mechanisms often linked less directly with literal [[physical health]]. It is closely related to a term he uses much less frequently, but which subsequent thinkers have taken up independently, [[biopolitics]], which aligns more closely with the examination of the strategies and mechanisms through which human life processes are managed under regimes of authority over knowledge, power, and the processes of subjectivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anthrobiopolitics.wordpress.com/2013/01/21/biopolitics-an-overview/|title=Biopolitics: An Overview|date=2013-01-21|work=The Anthropology of Biopolitics|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foucault's conception ==

For Foucault, biopower is a [[technology]] of [[power (sociology)|power]] for managing [[humans]] in large groups; the distinctive quality of this political technology is that it allows for the control of entire populations. It refers to the control of human bodies through an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' and ''biopolitics of the population'' through societal ''[[Disciplinary institutions]]''. Initially imposed from outside whose source remains elusive to further investigation both by the social sciences and the humanities, and in fact, you could argue will remain elusive as long as both disciplines use their current research methods. Modern power, according to Foucault's analysis, becomes [[encoded]] into social practices as well as human behavior as the human subject gradually acquiesces to subtle regulations and expectations of the social order. It is an integral feature and essential to the workings of—and makes possible—the emergence of the modern [[nation state]], [[capitalism]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/theory_and_event/v013/13.1.policante.html|title=Amedeo Policante. "War against Biopower: Timely Reflections on an Historicist Foucault", ''Theory &amp; Event'', 13. 1 March 2010|publisher=Muse.jhu.edu|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biopower is literally having power over bodies; it is "an explosion of numerous and diverse techniques for achieving the subjugation of bodies and the control of populations".&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''The History of Sexuality'' Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: The Will to Knowledge. London: Penguin. p.&amp;nbsp;140 (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault elaborates further in his lecture courses on biopower entitled ''Security, Territory, Population'' delivered at the Collège de France between January and April 1978:

{{cquote|By this I mean a number of phenomena that seem to me to be quite significant, namely, the set of mechanisms through which the basic biological features of the human species became the object of a political strategy, of a general strategy of power, or, in other words, how, starting from the 18th century, modern Western societies took on board the fundamental biological fact that human beings are a species. This is what I have called biopower.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p. 1 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It relates to governmental concerns of fostering the life of the population, "an ''anatomo-politics of the human body'' a global mass that is affected by overall characteristics specific to life, like birth, death, production, illness, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;''Nature Vol 490'' p. 309, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; It produces a generalized disciplinary society&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp. 377-378, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and ''regulatory controls'' through ''biopolitics of the population''".&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.,&amp;nbsp;378 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population’’, see also note 71, p. 397 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The History Of Sexuality Vol 1'' p.&amp;nbsp;139 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In his lecture ''Society Must Be Defended'', Foucault examines ''biopolitical state racism'', and its accomplished rationale of myth-making and narrative. Here he states the fundamental difference between biopolitics&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;91 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and discipline:

{{cquote|Where discipline is the technology deployed to make individuals behave, to be efficient and productive workers, biopolitics is deployed to manage population; for example, to ensure a healthy workforce.&lt;ref&gt;''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.&amp;nbsp;239&amp;ndash;64 (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that the previous [[Greco-Roman]], [[Medieval]] rule of the [[Roman emperor]], the [[Divine right of kings]], [[Absolute monarchy]] and the [[popes]]&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;363&amp;ndash;401 2007&lt;/ref&gt; model of power and social control over the body was an individualising mode based on a singular individual, primarily the king, [[Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman emperor]], pope and Roman emperor. However, after the emergence of the medieval metaphor [[body politic]] which meant society as a whole with the ruler, in this case the king, as the head of society with the so-called [[Estates of the realm]] and the Medieval [[Roman Catholic Church]] next to the monarch with the majority of the peasant population or feudal serfs at the bottom of the hierarchical pyramid. This meaning of the metaphor was then codified into medieval law for the offense of [[high treason]] and if found guilty the sentence of [[Hanged, drawn and quartered]] was carried out.&lt;ref&gt;''A declaration which offences shall be adjudged treason (25 Edw 3 St 5 c 2)'' 1351 "When a man does compass or imagine the death of our lord the king, or of our lady his Queen, or their eldest son and heir."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an excellent account of this legislation see John Barrell ''Imagining The King's Death Figurative Treason, Fantasies of Regicide, 1793-1796'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was drastically altered in 18th century Europe with the advent and realignment of modern political power as opposed to the ancient world and Medieval version of [[political power]]. The mass democracy of the Liberal western world and the voting franchise was added to the mass population; [[liberal democracy]] and [[Political parties]]; universal adult suffrage-exclusively male at this time, then extended to women in Europe in 1929(most certainly as late as 1971 in Switzerland see [[Women's suffrage in Switzerland]]), and extending to people of African descent in America with the abolition of the infamous [[Jim Crow laws]] in 1964 (see [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]]).

The emergence of the human sciences and its subsequent direction, during the 16th and 18th centuries, primarily aimed at the modern Western man and the society he inhabits, aided the development of ''[[Disciplinary institutions|Disciplinary institution]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;16 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and furthermore, Foucault cites the human sciences, particularly the medical sciences, led to the advent of ''anatomo-politics of the human body,'' a biopolitics and bio-history of man.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault Bio-history and Biopolitics ''Foucault Studies, No. 18, pp. 128‐130, October 2014'' Originally published in ''[[Le Monde]]'' October 1976 which was written as a review essay in response to [[Arthur Jensen]] overt racism and Foucault's great friend [[Jacques Ruffié]] response to Jensen's racist viewpoint, De la biologie à la culture [From biology to culture]&lt;/ref&gt; A transition occurred through forcible removal of various European monarchs into a "scientific" state apparatus and the radical overhaul of judiciary practices coupled with the reinvention and division of those who were to be punished.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;163&amp;ndash;90 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A second mode for seizure of power was developed as a type of power that was [[stochastic]] and "massifying" rather than "individualizing". By "massifying" Foucault means transforming into a population ("population state"),&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.55-86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; with an extra added impetus of a governing mechanism in the form of a scientific machinery and apparatus. This scientific mechanism which we now know as the [[state (polity)|State]] "governs less" of the population and concentrates more on administrating external devices. Foucault then reminds us that this ''anatomo-biopoltics'' of the body (and human life) and the population correlates with the new founded knowledge of sciences and the 'new' politics of modern society, masquerading as liberal democracy, where life (biological life) itself became not only a deliberate political strategy but an economic, political and scientific problem, both for the [[Mathematical sciences]] and the [[Biological sciences]]–coupled together with the nation state.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|And I think that one of the greatest transformations political right underwent in the 19th century was precisely that, I wouldn't say exactly that sovereignty's old right-to take life or let live-was replaced, but it came to be complemented by a new right which does not erase the old right but which penetrate it, permeate. To say that power took possession of life in the nineteenth century, or to say that power at least takes life under its care in the nineteenth century, is to say that it has, thanks to the play of technologies of discipline on the one hand and technologies of regulation on the other, succeeded in covering the whole surface that lies between the organic and the biological, between body and population. We are, then, in a power that has taken control of both the body and life or that has, if you like, taken control of life in general – with the body as one pole and the population as the other. What we are dealing with in this new technology of power is not exactly society (or at least not the social body, as defined by the jurists), nor is it the individual body. It is a new body, a multiple body, a body with so many heads that, while they might not be infinite in number, cannot necessarily be counted. Biopolitics deals with the population, with the population as a political problem, as a problem that is at once scientific and political, as a biological problem and as power’s problem I would like in fact like to trace the transformation not at the level of political theory, but rather at the level of the mechanisms, techniques, and technologies of power. We saw the emergence of techniques of power that were essentially centered on the body, on the individual body. They included all devices that were used to ensure the spatial distribution of individuals bodies (their separation, their alignment, their serialization, and their surveillance)and the organization, around those individuals, of a whole field of visibility. They were also techniques that could be used to take control over bodies. Attempts were made to increase their productive force through exercise, drill, and so on. They were also techniques for rationalizing and strictly economizing on a power that had to be used in the least costly way possible, thanks to whole system of surveillance, hierarchies, inspections, book-keeping, and reports-all the technology of labor. It was established at the end of the seventeenth century, and in the course of the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Michel Foucault ''Society Must Be Defended'' pp.241-244 and p.252 1975&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Foucault argues that nation states, police, government, legal practices, human sciences and medical institutions have their own rationale, cause and effects, strategies, technologies, mechanisms and codes and have managed successfully in the past to obscure their workings by hiding behind observation and scrutiny. Foucault insists social institutions such as governments, laws, religion, politics, social administration, monetary institutions, military institutions cannot have the same rigorous practices and procedure with claims to independent knowledge like those of the human and 'hard' sciences, such as mathematics, chemistry, astronomy, physics, genetics, and biology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Serge Lang]] Challenges pp.&amp;nbsp;1&amp;ndash;222 See Chapter Academia, Journalism, and Politics: A Case Study: The Huntington Case (Serge Lang refers to his dispute with [[Samuel P. Huntington]] at the [[National Academy of Sciences]]) (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault sees these differences in techniques as nothing more than "behaviour control technologies", and modern biopower as nothing more than a series of webs and networks working its way around the societal body.

However, Foucault argues the exercise of power in the service of maximizing life carries a dark underside. When the state is invested in protecting the life of the population, when the stakes are life itself, anything can be justified. Groups identified as the threat to the existence of the life of the nation or of humanity can be eradicated with impunity.

{{cquote|If [[genocide]] is indeed the dream of modern power, this is not because of the recent return to the ancient right to kill; it is because power is situated and exercised at the level of life, the species, the race, and the large-scale phenomena of the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The History of Sexuality'' Volume 1 p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== ''Milieu intérieur'' ==

Foucault concentrates his attention on what he calls the major political and social project namely the [[Milieu intérieur|Milieu]] (the environment within). How did the project milieu become interwoven into the political and social relations of men? Foucault takes as his starting point from the 16th century right up until the 18th century with the milieu culminating into the founding disciplines of science, mathematics,&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' p.&amp;nbsp;296 p.&amp;nbsp;308 Note 14 2007&lt;/ref&gt; political economy and statistics.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;29-49 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault makes an explicit point on the value of secrecy of government (''arcana imperii,'' from the Latin which means secrecy of power, secrets of the empire which goes back to the time of the Roman empire in the age of Tacitus) coined by [[Jean Bodin]]. Which, Foucault argues, had to be incorporated into a politics of truth. Foucault insist; in referring to the term 'public opinion'('politics of truth'),the concept of truth refers to the term 'regimes of truth'.In which Foucault mentions a group called ''The Ideologues'' where the term ''[[Ideology]]'' first appears and is taken from.&lt;ref&gt;Peter McCaffery ''Who were the Ideologues? How Influential Were They?'' 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, pp.&amp;nbsp;83&amp;ndash;84, note&amp;nbsp;27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It is through 'regimes of truth' Foucault argues that [[raison d'état]] achieves its political and biological success.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'' pp.&amp;nbsp;275&amp;ndash;78, p.&amp;nbsp;283, notes&amp;nbsp;63&amp;ndash;64 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Here the modern version of government is presented to the population in the national media, both in the electronic medium-television and radio-and especially in the written press, as the modicum of efficiency, fiscal optimisation, political responsibility, and fiscal rigorousness. Thus, a public discourse of government solidarity emerges and social consensus is emphasised through these four points. What general components were essential and necessary to make this consensus happen? Foucault traces the first dynamics, the first historical dimensions belonging to the early Middle Ages.

One major thinker which forms a parallel with Foucault’s own work is the Medieval historian [[Ernst Kantorowicz]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' pp.&amp;nbsp;25&amp;ndash;29 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Parrhesia:A Journal of Critical Philosophy'' 5 pp.&amp;nbsp;9&amp;ndash;18 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Discipline and Punish'' p.&amp;nbsp;330 1977&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Artur Golczewski ''Sovereign Right, Democracy and the Rule of Law'' Universitas 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz mentions a Medieval device known as the [[body politic]] (the king's two bodies). This Medieval device was so well received by legal theorists and lawyers of the day that it was incorporated and codified into Medieval society and institutions (Kantorowicz mentions the term [[Corporation]] which would later become known to us as [[capitalism]], an economic category).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Kantorowicz ''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;273&amp;ndash;313 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; Kantorowicz also refers to the [[Glossator]]'s belonging to a well-known branch of legal schools in medieval Europe, experts in jurisprudence and law science, appeal of treason, The [[Lords Appellant]] and the commentaries of jurist [[Edmund Plowden]]&lt;ref&gt;The commentaries, or Reports of [[Edmund Plowden]] 1561&lt;/ref&gt; and his Plowden Reports.&lt;ref&gt;Duchy Of Lancaster (1561) 1 Plowden 212,213.&lt;/ref&gt; In Kantorowicz analysis, a Medieval Political theology emerged throughout the Middle Ages which provided the modern basis for the democratisation of the [[hereditary succession]] of a wealthy elite and for our own modern political hierarchical order ([[Politicians]]) and their close association with the wealthy nobility.&lt;ref&gt;''The King's Two Bodies A Study In Mediaeval Political Theology'' pp.&amp;nbsp;42&amp;ndash;78 and pp.&amp;nbsp;87&amp;ndash;107 1956&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily, the democratisation of [[Sovereignty]], which is known in modern political terms as "[[Liberal democracy]]". Kantorowicz argues a Medieval triumvirate appears(with the support of the legal machine), a private enterprise of wealth and succession both supporting the fixed hierarchical order reserved exclusively for the nobility and their descendants, and the monarch and her/his heirs. Co-operation was needed by the three groups—the Monarchy, the Church, and the [[Nobility]]—in an uneasy Medieval alliance and at times, it appeared fractious.&lt;ref&gt;According to Sidney Madge the King wasn't the major land owner in medieval Christendom, Madge quite clearly and brilliantly shows at least in one instance the king was only third in line and he had to share that right with others.''The Domesday Of Crown Lands'', pp. 20–21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Much of Madge's information comes from [[Charles Henry Pearson]] meticulous study of the [[domesday]] records.{{Cite book|title=History Of England During The Early Middles Ages Volume 1 1867|last=Charles Henry Pearson|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}. Madge places the barons majority ownership of all land at 50.5% in 1086 (in 1065 it was 50.7%) by the time of the [[Norman conquest]] the monarch of the day—according to Madge analysis of Pearson's work the king wasn't, by all accounts, the major land owner; his percentage share was just 20.5% in 1065 before the conquest and dropped to 19.9% after the conquest in 1086. Moreover, the monarch had to share that right with the powerful [[Roman Catholic]] church of the day (the church's share was 28.8% in 1065; at the end of the conquest in 1086 it was 29.6%). This necessitated an efficient accountancy, and auditing system based on the basic premise: what was the overall fiscal responsibility and liability of the Exchequer, Treasury and the whole kingdom of the realm (kingdom in this case means the Barons and the church who funded the King's expenditure) and its ruler the King known as the [[Barons of the exchequer]], run, supervised and organized by the barons of the day.Sidney J Madge, The Domesday Of Crown Lands, pp.&amp;nbsp;20&amp;ndash;21, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout its history, it was never a smooth arrangement; see [[Barons war]].

What is the reasoning behind the whole population subservience with the worshiping of state emblems, symbols and related mechanisms with their associates who represent the institutional mechanism (democratization of sovereignty); where fierce loyalty from the population is presented, in modern times as universal admiration for the president, the monarch, the [[Pope]] and the prime minister, one could argue is it irony or fierce logic that dictates this sort of behaviour. Well, which one is it? Foucault would argue that while all the cost benefits were met by the new founded urban population in the form of production and [[Political power]] that it is precisely this type of behaviour which keeps the well-oiled machine smoothly ticking over and ultimately giving the [[Nation state]] not only its rationale but its "governing less" impenetrable apparatus. In other words, it is dictated by our own inherited political rationality which gives the false impression and appearance of joint solidarity giving the machine (Foucault uses the term [[Dispositif]]) not only legitimacy but an air of invincibility from its main primary sources: reason, truth, freedom, and human existence.

Foucault makes special note on the biological "naturalness" of the human species and the new founded scientific interest that was developing around not only with the species interaction with milieu and technology, but most importantly, technology operating as system not as so often portrayed by the political and social sciences which insisted on technology operating as social improvement. Both milieu, natural sciences and technology, allied with the characteristics surrounding social organization and increasingly the categorization of the sciences to help deal with this "naturalness" of milieu and of the inscription of truth onto nature. Due to Foucault's discussions with [[Georges Canguilhem]],&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, pp.&amp;nbsp;26-27, see notes 37&amp;ndash;38, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Foucault notices that not only was milieu now a newly discovered scientific biological naturalness ever-present in Lamarckian Biology the notion (biological naturalness) was actually invented and imported from Newtonian mechanics ([[Classical mechanics]]) via [[Georges-Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon]] due to Buffon mentorship and friendship with [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] and used by Biology in the middle of the 18th century borrowing from Newton the explanatory model of an organic reaction through the action of "milieu Newtonian" physics used by [[Isaac Newton]] and the Newtonians.&lt;ref&gt;Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;20, pp.&amp;nbsp;26&amp;ndash;27, see notes 33 and 37, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Humans (the species being mentioned in Marx) were now both the object of this newly discovered scientific and "natural" truth and new categorization, but subjected to it allied by laws, both scientific and [[natural law]] (scientific [[Jurisprudence]]), the state's mode of governmental rationality to the will of its population. But, most importantly, interaction with the social environment and social interactions with others and the modern nation state's interest in the populations well-being and the destructive capability that the state possess in its armoury and it was with the group who called themselves the ''[[Economist|économistes]]''&lt;ref&gt;officially known as the [[Physiocrats]], see ''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;34&amp;ndash;53, pp.&amp;nbsp;55-86, p.&amp;nbsp;52, note&amp;nbsp;17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Vincent de Gournay]], [[François Quesnay]], [[François Véron Duverger de Forbonnais]], and [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot]])&lt;ref&gt;Foucault makes mention of [[Vincent de Gournay]] in Security, Territory, Population, p.&amp;nbsp;51, note&amp;nbsp;15, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;333&amp;ndash;61, pp.&amp;nbsp;348&amp;ndash;49, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; who continued with the rationalization of this "naturalness". Foucault notices that this "naturalness" continues and is extended further with the advent of 18th century political society with the new founded implement "population" and their (political population) association with raison d'état.&lt;ref&gt;''Security, Territory, Population'', pp.&amp;nbsp;55&amp;ndash;86, p.&amp;nbsp;81, note&amp;nbsp;19, and pp.&amp;nbsp;285&amp;ndash;86 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Black Girl Magic''' (#BlackGirlMagic) is a concept and movement that was popularized by CaShawn Thompson in 2013.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Dexter|title=Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic'|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-everyones-saying-black-girls-are-magic-20150909-htmlstory.html|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=Los Angeles Times|date=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was born as a way to "celebrate the beauty, power and resilience of black women", as described by Julee Wilson from ''[[HuffPost]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Julee|title=The Meaning Of #BlackGirlMagic, And How You Can Get Some Of It|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/what-is-black-girl-magic-video_us_5694dad4e4b086bc1cd517f4|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=[[HuffPost]]|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to congratulate black women on their accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= Ali|first1=Rasha|title= What Is Black Girl Magic?

Girls|website=BET.com|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson explains that black women around the world persevering despite adversity inspired her to spread the concept of Black Girl Magic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; With these women in mind, Thompson created the social media hashtag, clothing campaign, and rallying cry "Black Girl Magic", in the hopes of counteracting negativity society places on black women.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brinkhurst-Cuff|first1=Charlie|title=How #BlackGirlMagic became a rallying cry for women of colour|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/apr/11/how-blackgirlmagic-became-a-rallying-cry-for-women-of-colour|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=The Guardian|date=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though born online, the movement has inspired many organizations across the world to host events using the title. The movement has also seen celebrity support, as singers [[Corinne Bailey Rae|Corinne Bailey Rae]], [[Janelle Monáe]] and [[Solange Knowles]] have invoked the concept,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Taylor|title=How British Singer Corinne Bailey Rae Describes 'Black Girl Magic'|url=http://www.essence.com/2016/03/16/corinne-bailey-rae-black-girl-magic-defined-representation|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=[[Essence (magazine)|Essence]]|date=16 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Toms|first1=Solange Knowles, Ben|title=How Our February Cover Star Amandla Stenberg Learned to Love Her Blackness|url=http://www.teenvogue.com/story/amandla-stenberg-interview-teen-vogue-february-2016|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=Teen Vogue|issue=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ballerina [[Misty Copeland]] and [[Barack Obama|President Barack Obama]] discussed the idea in an interview with [[Maya Rhodan]] for [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[Essence (magazine)|''Essence'']] magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Sydney|title=EXCLUSIVE: President Obama and Misty Copeland Talk Black Girl Magic and the Importance of Social Movements|url=http://www.essence.com/2016/03/14/misty-copeland-president-obama-conversation-black-girl-magic|accessdate=3 September 2016|work=Essence|date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, poet [[Mahogany L. Browne]] created a [[poetry slam|slam poetry]] piece entitled "Black Girl Magic".&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/poet-mahogany-l-browne-on-black-girl-magic|title=Poet Mahogany L. Browne on ‘black girl magic’|date=February 25, 2016|work=[[PBS NewsHour]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding==

===Hashtag===

In 2013, Thompson coined the phrase via the [[hashtag]] #BlackGirlsAreMagic— now shortened to #BlackGirlMagic—to create an online dialogue centered around the achievements of black women, in a society that has historically recognized very few of these achievements.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Since being popularized, one can find the hashtag being used on [[Twitter]], [[Instagram]], [[Facebook]], and other social media and mainstream media platforms, celebrating positive messages and images of black women all across the globe.

=== Clothing campaign===

In January 2014, Thompson began selling t-shirts sporting the "Black Girls Are Magic" logo that she created with her friend.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; At the time, Thompson only meant to sell these shirts to her friends and family, but has since sold over 3,000 T-shirts through her Teespring account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1= D'Oyley|first1=Demetria Lucas|title= Elle, You Just Don’t Understand #BlackGirlMagic.|url=http://www.theroot.com/articles/culture/2016/01/elle_you_just_don_t_understand_blackgirlmagic/|accessdate=30 November 2016|work=TheWrap|date=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the popularity of the shirts started among active social media users, Thompson was quickly surprised to see that people were also buying them as gifts for granddaughters, daughters, and nieces, as they felt that the message was encouraging for young girls too.

The shirts have also gained some celebrity recognition, with prominent young black women such as [[Willow Smith]] and [[Amandla Stenberg]] posting pictures of themselves on various social media platforms wearing their Black Girls Are Magic gear.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Philosophy==

"I say 'magic' because it's something that people don't always understand," Thompson told [[Los Angeles Times|''The Los Angeles Times'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/nationnow/la-na-nn-everyones-saying-black-girls-are-magic-20150909-htmlstory.html|title=Why everyone's saying 'Black Girls are Magic'|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to explain how "Sometimes our accomplishments might seem to come out of thin air, because a lot of times, the only people supporting us are other black women." At its core, the purpose of this movement is to create a platform where women of color can stand together against the [[stereotyping]], [[colourism]], [[misogynoir]] and [[racism]] that is often their lived experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Controversy==

As its usage has grown, the concept has also drawn criticism.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

==="Black girls aren't magic. We're human." ===

While many black women support the concept of Black Girl Magic, some{{who?|date=November 2017}} feel it reinforces the "strong black woman" [[archetype]] that black women often confront. In an article for [[Elle (magazine)|Elle Magazine]], Linda Chavers argued that the movement suggests that black women are superhuman, or something other than human.&lt;ref name= ":2"&gt;{{cite news|last1= Chavers|first1=Linda|title= Here's My Problem With #BlackGirlMagic|url=http://www.elle.com/life-love/a33180/why-i-dont-love-blackgirlmagic//|accessdate=6 November 2016|work=Elle Magazine|date=13 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to explain how, historically, black women have been seen and treated as subhuman beings, and how the image of black women persevering despite her suffering, is the epitome of the strong black woman type that is often celebrated while simultaneously being criticized in today's culture.&lt;ref name= ":2"/&gt;

== Legacy ==
In 2016, Black Girl Magic Ltd was established as an [[nonprofit organization]] in an attempt to create a legacy and continuity throughout the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/10477476|title=BLACK GIRL MAGIC LTD - Overview (free company information from Companies House)|website=beta.companieshouse.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9234">'''CEDEP''', also known as '''The European Centre for Executive Development''' (in French, '''Le Centre Européen d'Education Permanente'''), is an international, not-for-profit organization co-located on the [[INSEAD]] campus in [[Fontainebleau]], France, about 50&amp;nbsp;km from Paris.  Founded in 1972, it operates as an executive club and corporate university for a diverse set of 20 global companies including [[L’Oréal]], [[Aviva]], [[Renault]], [[Bekaert]], [[Valeo]], [[AXA]], [[GDF Suez]], and [[TATA Group|TATA Steel]]. CEDEP offers two types of programs: Open Enrollment, available to managers from all member companies, and Company Specific programs. Most programs are delivered on CEDEP's  purpose-built, residential campus, but in recent years CEDEP has been delivering programs off-campus, notably in China, Brazil, and Canada.

== History ==

CEDEP was created over 40 years ago by a group of European companies as an executive education club, and was among the first corporate-founded membership institutions in Europe dedicated to executive education.&lt;ref&gt;''The nucleus of Europe's management education'', The Times (of London) May 11, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;  In its early days, CEDEP was essentially a sister organization to INSEAD, which at the time focused on MBA education.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Former des cadres sur mésure'' by Jacques Malherbe, l'Aurore. November 19, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  Faculty teaching at CEDEP in its early years were drawn almost exclusively from INSEAD's more experienced faculty, notably [[Henri-Claude de Bettignies]],  Robin Hogarth, Claude Rameau, and Lee Remmers.&lt;ref&gt;''INSEAD: d'une intuition a une institution'' by Jean-Louis Barsoux, INSEAD 2000, {{ISBN|0-333-92534-3}}, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial impetus was led by L'Oréal's head of Human Resources, Guy Landon, and [[François Dalle]], its CEO.  They were joined by {{ill|Antoine Riboud|fr}} and Jean-Leon Donnadieu (BSN, which later merged with Gervais-Danone), {{ill|Renaud Gillet|fr}} (Pricel and Rhone Progil, which would become part of the Rhone-Poulenc group), {{ill|Antoine Bekaert|nl}} (Bekaert), and René Dunant (Sandoz).&lt;ref&gt;''Cedep: une "vraie" formation permanente'' by Martine Borrelly, Les Informations No. 1384&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''M Renaud Gillet: vice président du Rhone Poulenc'' by A.V., Le Figaro, August 24, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; The three main objectives for the founders were to: (1) expose managers to a mix of nationalities and industry contexts; (2) provide participants with a contrast between the theories and practice of management; and (3) create a force for change within their companies by establishing a critical mass of managers who had shared a key educational experience.&lt;ref&gt;''Assessing management education: A summary of the CEDEP project'' by R. M. Hogarth, Journal of European Industrial Training, 2, (Whole No. 2), pp. 3-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The CEDEP campus was opened in 1971 by the then French Finance Minister, [[Valery Giscard d'Estaing]],&lt;ref&gt;''Inauguration à Fontainebleau du centre européen d'education permanente'' by G.S., Le Figaro November 19, 1971 (Section "Université")&lt;/ref&gt; who was to become France's President just three years later.  Designed by a contemporary French architect, Bernard de la Tour d'Auvergne, who also helped design the original buildings on the INSEAD campus, the buildings combine brick and glass to reflect the colors of the surrounding [[Fontainebleau Forest]].&lt;ref&gt;''Architecture d'Aujourd'hui'' No. 160, Fevrier-Mars 1972 pp. 54-7&lt;/ref&gt;  The buildings were extended in 2000 with additional wings that conserve the architectural style of the original buildings.  The campus grounds also feature large sculptures by a number of celebrated European sculptors, including [[wikipedia:Les Lalanne|Francois-Xavier and Claude Lalanne]], who designed the original campus,&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook&gt;''CEDEP: 40 Years of Adding Value'' (an official history of CEDEP),CEDEP 2012, {{ISBN|978-2-7466-3440-4}}, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Marino di Teana|Francesco Marino di Teana]].  The campus interior houses a notable collection of contemporary wall carpets by the likes of [[Sonia Delaunay]] (co-founder of the [[Orphism (art)|Orphism]] movement), {{ill|Ivan da Silva-Bruhns|fr}} and [[Natalia Dumitresco]].&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;

CEDEP's evolution was greatly influenced by two long-serving Directors. In 1971 Salvatore Teresi, an INSEAD Marketing professor who was also one of CEDEP's founders, became its first Director General. Over the following 20 years he oversaw an expansion in membership to 23 companies that resulted in more than 6,000 participants attending CEDEP's programs.&lt;ref&gt;''CEDEP Twenty Years After And For A New Departure'', Text of addresses given by Guy LANDON, Claude RAMEAU, and Salvatore TERESI to mark the retirement of Salvatore TERESI as Director of CEDEP, printed by HELIO SERVICE 1991, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Claude Michaud]], Teresi's Deputy Director (and also an INSEAD professor), took over in 1991 and led CEDEP for the next 16 years. Under his leadership CEDEP extended its membership to 20 members, including companies from outside Europe, most notably Tata Steel.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;  It was also under Michaud's tenure that CEDEP started offering off-campus programs, in Hong Kong, Singapore, and India.&lt;ref name=CEDEPBook /&gt;  Under the tenure of Michaud's successor, [[Han van Dissel]], CEDEP extended its overseas activities, offering off-campus programs in China, Brazil, Canada and South Korea.

In 1979, an INSEAD decision-science professor, Robin M Hogarth, who also taught at CEDEP, undertook an in-depth study of CEDEP's General Management Program in order to assess whether executive education improved managerial decision-making.  This project resulted in a book, ''Evaluating Management Education,'' published by John Wiley &amp; Sons in 1979 ( {{ISBN|978-0471997399}}).

The '''Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies''' ('''CCCS''') was a research centre at the University of Birmingham, England. It was founded in 1964 by [[Richard Hoggart]], its first director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Graeme |title=British cultural studies : an introduction |date=2002 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415252287 |edition=3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 2002, the Centre played a major role in developing the field of [[cultural studies]].

== History ==
The Centre was the focus for what became known as the Birmingham School of Cultural Studies, or, more generally, 'British cultural studies'.  After its first director, [[Richard Hoggart]] departed in 1968, the Centre was led by [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] (1969-1979). He was succeeded by Richard Johnson (1980-1987).  The Birmingham CCCS approach to culture and politics evolved from a complex moment within British post-war history: the rise of the anti-Stalinist New Left; the promotion of adult education in Britain after World War II; the "Americanization" of British popular culture and the growth of mass communication in the decades after 1945; the growing multiculturalism of British society; and, the eventual influence within British academia of new critical methods like semiotics and structuralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hall |first1=Stuart |title=Race, Culture, and Communications: Looking Backward and Forward at Cultural Studies |journal=Rethinking Marxism |date=March 1992 |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=10–18 |doi=10.1080/08935699208657998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dworkin |first1=Dennis |title=Cultural Marxism in postwar Britain : history, the new left, and the origins of cultural studies |date=1997 |publisher=Duke University Press |isbn=0822319144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on a variety of influences ([[feminism]], [[structuralism]], [[Marxism]] - - especially the work of [[Louis Althusser]] and [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[sociology]], [[critical race theory]], and [[post-structuralism]]), over the course of several decades the Centre pioneered a variety of approaches to the study of culture, including: ideological analysis; studies of working-class cultures and subcultures; the role of media audiences; feminist cultural research; hegemonic struggles in state politics; and the place of race in social and cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shulman |first1=Norma |title="Conditions of their Own Making: An Intellectual History of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham" |journal=Canadian Journal of Communication |date=1993 |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of this development can be found in the series of stencilled occasional papers the Centre published between 1973 and 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Stencilled Occasional Papers of the Birmingham CCCS - University of Birmingham |url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/schools/historycultures/departments/history/research/projects/cccs/publications/stencilled-occasional-papers.aspx |website=www.birmingham.ac.uk |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;   


== Noted staff members ==
The Centre produced many key studies and developed the careers of prominent researchers and academics. [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]], who became the centre's director in 1968, developed his seminal ''Encoding/Decoding'' model here. Of special importance is the collective research that led to Policing the Crisis (1978), a study of law and order campaigns that focused on "mugging" (a code for street violence). This anticipated many of the law and order themes of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s Conservative government in the 1980s. Other noted Centre books include 'Off-Centre: Feminism and Cultural Studies'; 'Resistance through Rituals'; 'The Empire Strikes Back'; 'Border Patrols: Policing the Boundaries of Heterosexuality'.

Richard Johnson was later director and encouraged research in social and cultural history. The centre staff included Maureen McNeil, noted theorist of culture and science, Michael Green who focused on media,  cultural policy and regional cultures in the midlands, and Ann Gray, culture and media.

Graduates and associates of the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies and the Department of Cultural Studies include: [[Paul Gilroy]] (King's College London) theorist of culture and race, [[Angela McRobbie]] (Goldsmiths) theorist of consumption, femininity and popular culture, Celia Lury (Goldsmiths) feminist theory and consumption, Jackie Stacey (University of Manchester), film, cancer culture and science in culture, Sarah Franklin (LSE) science as culture, Debbie Epstein (University of Cardiff), education, childhood and youth studies, sexuality and popular culture, Peter Redman (The Open University) masculinities, psychoanalytic theory, Mary Jane Kehily (The Open University) childhood and youth studies, Joyce Canaan (City University, Birmingham) cultures of higher education, Anoop Nayak (Newcastle University) geographies of race,  Deborah Lynn Steinberg (Warwick University) science cultures, sexuality and popular culture, Hilary Pilkington (Warwick University) Russia and youth subcultures, Sue Wright (Danish Pedagogic University) cultures of higher education, Hazel Carby (Yale) race and literature, David Parker (Nottingham University), Mica Nava (University of East London) media studies,  Graham Dawson (University of Brighton) historical cultural studies, Chris Griffin (Bath University) girls and youth cultures,  and Adrian Kear (Aberystwith University) performance studies and psychoanalysis, Kevin J. Brehony (Roehampton University) historical studies of educational ideologies.

[[Empirical]] researchers included David Morley and Charlotte Brunsdon, who produced ''[[The Nationwide Project]]'' at the Centre. Dorothy Hobson's research about the reception of ''[[Crossroads (soap opera)|Crossroads]]'' was based on her MA dissertation. Another important empirical researcher is [[Paul Willis (cultural theorist)|Paul Willis]], who received his PhD from the CCCS in 1972 and stayed as a researcher there until 1981.

In later years, on the dissolution of the Centre and formation of the Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology (CSS), [[Sadie Plant]], noted cybertheorist and feminist (author of ''Zeroes + Ones: Digital Women and the New Technoculture''), taught there, as did Jorge Larrain, the well-known Chilean sociologist and cultural historian, author of ''Identity and Modernity in Latin America'' and John Gabriel, sociologist of race. [[Frank Webster (sociologist)|Frank Webster]], a Sociologist with interests in Information Society issues and sympathy for the 'cultural turn', joined the newly formed Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology in 1999, but left for City University London when the department was abruptly closed in 2002.

== Closure in 2002 ==
{{tone|date=December 2014}}
The new Department of Cultural Studies and Sociology was unexpectedly and abruptly closed in 2002, a move the university's senior management described as 'restructuring'. The immediate reason given for disestablishment of the new department was an unexpectedly low result in the UK's Research Assessment Exercise of 2001, though a dean from the university described the decision as a consequence of "inexperienced 'macho management.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Webster|first1=Frank|title=Cultural Studies and Sociology at, and After, the Closure of the Birmingham School|journal=Cultural Studies|date=2004|volume=18|issue=6|page=848}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Four of the department's fourteen members of staff were to be "retained" and its hundreds of students (nearly 250 undergraduates and postgraduates at that time, many from abroad) to be transferred to other departments. In the ensuing dispute most department staff left. There were protests against the decision to close Cultural Studies and Sociology from around the world and the University received much adverse criticism.

In April 2002, according to student testimonies, rumors began to circulate that the Department was going to be closed down because it had received a "very bad" 3a mark in a recent [[Research Assessment Exercise]] (RAE). Despite assurances as to the contrary, on June 21, 2002, right after the end of term, staff members received emails informing them of a decision that had already been taken to close down the Department. The decision was to be ratified on June 26.

Students and staff began a campaign to save the school, which gained considerable attention in the national press (see links below) and sparked numerous letters of support from former [[alumni]] all over the world. The main argument of the campaigners was that the Department was being closed down because of economic pressures relating to the public funding of British universities in accordance with RAE marks. The Department of Cultural Studies was a top money-making unit inside the School of Social Sciences.

Additionally, concerns were expressed that the Department was being "belatedly punished" for its political [[Radicalization|radicalism]], as one journalist put it. Indeed, the unreservedly [[leftwing]] Department's long history of conflict with the University's administration was well known to all{{dubious|date=August 2016}} who had studied at the [[University of Birmingham]] between the 1960s and the 1980s.{{Cn|date=August 2016}}

Of the four staff members who were "retained", one was attached to the Department of Social Policy, one to the Department of English, and one to the Institute of European Studies. The remaining ten staff members were invited to retire voluntarily in return for a severance package (one year's pay).

Professor [[David Marsh (political scientist)|David Marsh]], a political sociologist from the Department of Political Science and International Studies (POLSIS), was drafted in as temporary head of a new Department of Sociology, with Cultural Studies dropped from the title. Further posts were created in Sociology during 2003.

The Department had been top of the Guardian league table for Sociology before its closure and it continues to excel in this poll. The Department was recently ranked fourth in Guardian league tables for Sociology.

== 50th anniversary ==

{{update-section|date=August 2016}}
The 50th anniversary of the establishment of CCCS came in 2014. To mark this occasion, academics at the [[University of Birmingham]]– in collaboration with former members of staff at the Centre, including Richard Johnson, [[Stuart Hall (cultural theorist)|Stuart Hall]] and Michael Green, created an archive of CCCS-related material at the Cadbury Research Library at Birmingham.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}

'''Comparative psychology''' refers to the scientific study of the behavior and mental processes of non-human animals, especially as these relate to the phylogenetic history, adaptive significance, and development of behavior. Research in this area addresses many different issues, uses many different methods and explores the behavior of many different species from insects to primates.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Papini, M.R. (2003). Comparative Psychology. In ''Handbook of Research Methods in Experimental Psychology''. Ed. Stephen F. Davis. Blackwell. Malden, MA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Comparative psychology is sometimes assumed to emphasize cross-species comparisons, including those between humans and animals. However, some researchers feel that direct comparisons should not be the sole focus of comparative psychology and that intense focus on a single [[organism]] to understand its behavior is just as desirable; if not more so. Donald Dewsbury reviewed the works of several psychologists and their definitions and concluded that the object of comparative psychology is to establish principles of generality focusing on both [[proximate and ultimate causation]].  &lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1984). ''Comparative Psychology in the Twentieth Century''. Hutchinson Ross Publishing Company. Stroudsburg, PA.&lt;/ref&gt;

Using a comparative approach to behavior allows one to evaluate the target behavior from four different, complementary perspectives, developed by Niko Tinbergen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tinbergen | first1 = N. | year = 1963 | title = On aims and methods of ethology | url = | journal = Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 410–33 | doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1963.tb01161.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; First, one may ask how pervasive the behavior is across species (i.e. how common is the behavior between animal species?). Second, one may ask how the behavior contributes to the lifetime reproductive success of the individuals demonstrating the behavior (i.e. does the behavior result in animals producing more offspring than animals not displaying the behavior)? Theories addressing the ultimate causes of behavior are based on the answers to these two questions.

Third, what mechanisms are involved in the behavior (i.e. what physiological, behavioral, and environmental components are necessary and sufficient for the generation of the behavior)? Fourth, a researcher may ask about the development of the behavior within an individual (i.e. what maturational, learning, social experiences must an individual undergo in order to demonstrate a behavior)? Theories addressing the proximate causes of behavior are based on answers to these two questions. For more details see [[Tinbergen's four questions]].

==History==
The 9th century scholar [[al-Jahiz]] wrote works on the social organization and communication methods of animals like ants.&lt;ref name=Amber-376&gt;{{Harv|Haque|2004|p=376}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 11th century Arabic writer [[Ibn al-Haytham]] (Alhazen) wrote the ''Treatise on the Influence of Melodies on the Souls of Animals'', an early treatise dealing with the effects of [[zoomusicology|music on an imals]]. In the treatise, he demonstrates how a camel's pace could be hastened or retarded with the use of [[Arabic music|music]], and shows other examples of how music can affect [[ethology|animal behavior]], experimenting with horses, birds and reptiles. Through to the 19th century, a majority of scholars in the [[Western world]] continued to believe that music was a distinctly human phenomenon, but experiments since then have vindicated Ibn al-Haytham's view that music does indeed have an effect on animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Plott|2000|p=461}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Darwin]] was central in the development of comparative psychology; it is thought that psychology should be spoken in terms of "pre-" and "post-Darwin" because his contributions were so influential.   theory led to several hypotheses, one being that the factors that set humans apart, such as higher mental, moral and spiritual faculties, could be accounted for by evolutionary principles. In response to the vehement opposition to Darwinism was the "anecdotal movement" led by [[George Romanes]] who set out to demonstrate that animals possessed a "rudimentary human mind".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; Romanes is most famous for two major flaws in his work: his focus on anecdotal observations and entrenched [[anthropomorphism]].&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"&gt;Dewsbury, D. (1978). ''Comparative Animal Behavior''. McGraw-Hill Book Company. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the end of the 19th century, several scientists existed whose work was also very influential. [[Douglas Alexander Spalding]] was called the "first experimental biologist",&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt; and worked mostly with birds; studying instinct, imprinting, and visual and auditory development. [[Jacques Loeb]] emphasized the importance of objectively studying behavior, [[Sir John Lubbock]] is credited with first using mazes and puzzle devices to study learning and [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] is thought to be "the first ethologist in the sense in which we presently use the word".&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1984"/&gt;

Throughout the long history of comparative psychology, repeated attempts have been made to enforce a more disciplined approach, in which similar studies are carried out on animals of different species, and the results interpreted in terms of their different phylogenetic or ecological backgrounds. Behavioral ecology in the 1970s gave a more solid base of knowledge against which a true comparative psychology could develop. However, the broader use of the term "comparative psychology" is enshrined in the names of learned societies and academic journals, not to mention in the minds of psychologists of other specialisms, so the label of the field is never likely to disappear completely.

A persistent question with which comparative psychologists have been faced is the relative intelligence of different species of animal. Indeed, some early attempts at a genuinely comparative psychology involved evaluating how well animals of different species could learn different tasks. These attempts floundered; in retrospect it can be seen that they were not sufficiently sophisticated, either in their analysis of the demands of different tasks, or in their choice of species to compare.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;  However, the definition of "intelligence" in comparative psychology is deeply affected by anthropomorphism, and focuses on simple tasks, complex problems, reversal learning, learning sets, and delayed alternation are plagued with practical and theoretical problems.&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt; In the literature, "intelligence" is defined as whatever is closest to human performance and neglects behaviors that humans are usually incapable of (e.g. [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]]).&lt;ref name="Wynne, C. D. L., 1978"&gt;Wynne, C. D. L. (1978). ''Animal Cognition: The Mental Lives of Animals''. Palgrave. New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, comparative researchers encounter problems associated with individual differences, differences in motivation, differences in reinforcement, differences in sensory function, differences in motor capacities, and species-typical preparedness (i.e. some species have evolved to acquire some behaviors quicker than other behaviors).&lt;ref name="Dewsbury, D. 1978"/&gt;

==Species studied==
[[Image:Cat brain.jpg|right|thumb|the brain of a cat]]
A wide variety of species have been studied by comparative psychologists. However, a small number have dominated the scene. [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s early work used dogs; although they have been the subject of occasional studies, since then they have not figured prominently. Increasing interest in the study of abnormal animal behavior has led to a return to the study of most kinds of domestic animal. [[Edward Thorndike|Thorndike]] began his studies with cats, but American comparative psychologists quickly shifted to the more economical [[rat]], which remained the almost invariable subject for the first half of the 20th century and continues to be used.

Skinner introduced the use of [[pigeon]]s, and they continue to be important in some fields. There has always been interest in studying various species of [[primate]]; important contributions to social and developmental psychology were made by [[Harry F. Harlow]]'s studies of [[maternal deprivation]] in [[rhesus monkey]]s. Cross-fostering studies have shown similarities between human infants and infant chimpanzees. Kellogg and Kellogg&lt;ref&gt;Kellogg, W.N. and L.A. Kellogg. (1933) ''The Ape and The Child: A Comparative Study of the Environmental Influence Upon Early Behavior''. Hafner Publishing Co., New York and London.&lt;/ref&gt; (1933) aimed to look at heredity and environmental effects of young primates. They found that a cross-fostered chimpanzee named [[Gua (chimpanzee)|Gua]] was better at recognizing human smells and clothing and that the Kelloggs' infant (Donald) recognised humans better by their faces. The study ended 9 months after it had begun, after the infant began to imitate the noises of Gua.

Nonhuman primates have also been used to show the development of language in comparison with human development. For example, Gardner (1967) successfully taught the female chimpanzee [[Washoe (chimpanzee)|Washoe]] 350 words in [[American Sign Language]]. Washoe subsequently passed on some of this teaching to her adopted offspring, [[Loulis (chimpanzee)|Loulis]]. A criticism of Washoe's acquisition of sign language focused on the extent to which she actually understood what she was signing. Her signs may have just based on an association to get a reward, such as food or a toy. Other studies concluded that apes do not understand linguistic input, but may form an intended meaning of what is being communicated.&lt;ref&gt;Terrace (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savage-Rumbaugh (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Klaus Zuberbühler |title=Linguistic capacity of non-human animals |journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Cognitive Science |volume=6 |date=2015 |pages=313-321 |doi=10.1002/wcs.1338 
 |url=https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/8091/Zuberbuehler_2015_WIRCS_Linguistic_AM.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; All great apes have been reported to have the capacity of allospecific symbolic production.

Interest in primate studies has increased with the rise in studies of animal cognition. Other animals thought to be [[intelligence (trait)|intelligent]] have also been increasingly studied. Examples include various species of [[corvid]], parrots — especially the [[grey parrot]] — and [[dolphin]]s. Alex (Avian Learning EXperiment) is a well known case study (1976–2007) which was developed by Pepperberg,&lt;ref&gt;Pepperberg, I. M. 1991 A communicative approach to animal cognition: a study of conceptual abilities of a grey parrot. In: ''Cognitive Ethology: the Minds of Other Animals'' (Ed. Carolyn A. Ristau), Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Hillsdale New Jersey; Hove and London England.&lt;/ref&gt; who found that the African gray parrot [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]] did not only mimic vocalisations but understood the concepts of same and different between objects. The study of non-human mammals has also included the study of dogs. Due to their domestic nature and personalities, dogs have lived closely with humans, and parallels in communication and cognitive behaviours have therefore been recognised and further researched. Joly-Mascheroni and colleagues (2008) demonstrated that dogs may be able to catch human yawns and suggested a  level of empathy in dogs, a point that is strongly debated. Pilley and Reid&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=John W. Pilley |author2=Alliston K. Reid |title=Border collie comprehends object names as verbal referents |journal=Behavioural Processes |volume=86 |date=2011 |pages=184–195 |doi=10.1016/j.beproc.2010.11.007 
 |url=http://webs.wofford.edu/reidak/Pubs/Pilley%20and%20Reid%202011.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that a [[Border Collie]] named [[Chaser (dog)|Chaser]] was able to successfully identify and retrieve 1022 distinct objects/toys.

==Animal cognition==
{{main|Animal cognition}}
Researchers who study [[animal cognition]] are interested in understanding the mental processes that control complex behavior, and much of their work parallels that of cognitive psychologists working with humans.  For example, there is extensive research with animals on attention, categorization, concept formation, memory, spatial cognition, and time estimation. Much research in these and other areas is related directly or indirectly to behaviors important to survival in natural settings, such as navigation, tool use, and numerical competence. Thus, comparative psychology and [[animal cognition]] are heavily overlapping research categories.&lt;ref  name="Menzel"&gt;p. 2, Menzel, R. &amp; Fischer, J. (2010) ''Animal Thinking: Contemporary Issues in Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Wass"&gt;Wasserman &amp; Zentall (eds) (2006); ''Comparative Cognition''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shettleworth, Sara J. (2010); ''Cognition, Evolution, and Behavior (2nd Ed)'', Oxford Univ. Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders of animal behavior==
{{Further|Animal psychopathology}}
Veterinary surgeons recognize that the psychological state of a captive or domesticated animal must be taken into account if its behavior and health are to be understood and optimized.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

Common causes of disordered behavior in captive or [[pet]] animals are lack of stimulation, inappropriate stimulation, or overstimulation. These conditions can lead to disorders, unpredictable and unwanted behavior, and sometimes even physical symptoms and diseases. For example, [[rat]]s who are exposed to loud music for a long period will ultimately develop unwanted behaviors that have been compared with human [[psychosis]], like biting their owners.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

The way dogs behave when understimulated is widely believed to depend on the [[dog breed|breed]] as well as on the individual animal's character. For example, [[huskies]] have been known to ruin gardens and houses if they are not allowed enough activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ian|url=http://www.preloved.co.uk/blog/permalink/17/interview-siberian-husky-club-of-great-britain.html|title=Interview - Siberian Husky Club of Great Britain|publisher=''Preloved''|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogs are also prone to psychological damage if they are subjected to violence. If they are treated very badly, they may become dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dass|first=Dr. Amrita|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1081023/jsp/careergraph/story_10004432.jsp|title=Pet Peeves|publisher=[[The Telegraph (Calcutta)|''The Telegraph'' (Calcutta)]]|date=October 23, 2008|accessdate=May 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The systematic study of disordered animal behavior draws on research in comparative psychology, including the early work on conditioning and instrumental learning, but also on [[ethological]] studies of natural behavior. However, at least in the case of familiar domestic animals, it also draws on the accumulated experience of those who have worked closely with the animals.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

==Human-animal relationships==
{{Main|Anthrozoology}}

The relationship between humans and animals has long been of interest to anthropologists as one pathway to an understanding the evolution of human behavior. Similarities between the behavior of humans and animals have sometimes been used in an attempt to understand the evolutionary significance of particular behaviors. Differences in the treatment of animals have been said to reflect a society's understanding of human nature and the place of humans and animals in the scheme of things. [[Domestication]] has been of particular interest. For example, it has been argued that, as animals became domesticated, humans treated them as property and began to see them as inferior or fundamentally different from humans.&lt;ref&gt;Mullin, Molly. "Animals and Anthropology." Society and Animals: ''Journal of Human-Animal Studies''. 2002. Web. &lt;http://www.societyandanimalsforum.org/sa/sa10.4/mullin.shtml&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Ingold &lt;ref&gt;Ingold, Ted, ed. ''What Is an Animal?'' Routledge, 1994. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; remarks that in all societies children have to learn to differentiate and separate themselves from others. In this process, strangers may be seen as "not people," and like animals. Ingold quoted Sigmund Freud: "Children show no trace of arrogance which urges adult civilized men to draw a hard-and-fast line between their own nature and that of all other animals. Children have no scruples over allowing animals to rank as their full equals."  With maturity however, humans find it hard to accept that they themselves are animals, so they categorize, separating humans from animals, and animals into wild animals and tame animals, and tame animals into house pets and livestock. Such divisions can be seen as similar to categories of humans: who is part of a human community and someone who isn't, that is, the outsider.

''[[The New York Times]]'' ran an article that showed the psychological benefits of animals,&lt;ref&gt;Goleman, Daniel. "Health; Children and Their Pets: Unexpected Psychological Benefits." The ''New York Times''. 1990. Web. &lt;https://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/us/health-children-and-their-pets-unexpected-psychological-benefits.html?src=pm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; more specifically of children with their pets. It's been proven that having a pet does in fact improve kids' social skills. In the article, Dr. Sue Doescher, a psychologist involved in the study, stated, "It made the children more cooperative and sharing." It was also shown that these kids were more confident with themselves and able to be more empathic with other children.

Furthermore, in an edition of ''Social Science and Medicine'' it was stated, "A random survey of 339 residents from [[Perth, Western Australia]] were selected from three suburbs and interviewed by telephone. Pet ownership was found to be positively associated with some forms of social contact and interaction, and with perceptions of neighborhood friendliness. After adjustment for demographic variables, pet owners scored higher on social capital and civic engagement scales."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Lisa, Billie Giles-Corti, and Max Bulsara. "The Pet Connection: Pets as a Conduit for Social Capital?" ''Social Science and Medicine'' 61. 2005. 1159–73. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Results like these let us know that owning a pet provides opportunities for neighborly interaction, among many other chances for socialization among people.

'''Engineers Without Borders Ireland''' is an [[international development]] organisation for students and professionals from [[Ireland]] who share a common interest in [[sustainable development]] through engineering and [[appropriate technologies]].

The organisation was initially founded in 2007, and partook in a 2-week project in the [http://www.sonairte.ie/ Sonairte: The National Ecology Centre] in Co. Meath, Ireland. After a lull in activities, a small group of engineers began discussions on reviving EWB-Ireland in 2009. These discussions led to the formation of EWB-Ireland's first ever national committee in January 2010. The committee is a small group of committed engineers from numerous disciplines, located throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/history EWB-Ireland Website - History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, EWB-Ireland has branches in [[University College Dublin]] and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ewb-ireland.org/branches EWB Ireland Website - Branches]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mr. William Shakespeare's Comedies, Histories, &amp; Tragedies''''' is the 1623 published collection of [[William Shakespeare]]'s plays. Modern scholars commonly refer to it as the '''First Folio'''.{{efn|More generally, the term ''first folio'' is employed in other appropriate contexts, as in connection with the [[Ben Jonson folios|first folio collection of Ben Jonson's works]] (1616), or the first folio collection of the plays in the [[Beaumont and Fletcher folios|Beaumont and Fletcher canon]] (1647).}} The First Folio is considered one of the most influential books ever published in the English language.{{sfn|The Guardian|2015}}

Printed in [[Folio (printing)|folio]] format and containing 36 plays (see [[Shakespeare's plays#Canonical plays|list of Shakespeare's plays]]), it was prepared by Shakespeare's colleagues [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]]. It was dedicated to the "incomparable pair of brethren" [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]] and his brother [[Philip Herbert, 4th Earl of Pembroke|Philip Herbert]], Earl of Montgomery (later 4th Earl of Pembroke).

Although 18 of Shakespeare's plays had been published in [[quarto]] before 1623, the First Folio is arguably the only reliable text for about 20 of the plays, and a valuable source text for many of those previously published. The Folio includes all of the plays generally accepted to be Shakespeare's, with the exception of ''[[Pericles, Prince of Tyre]]''; ''[[The Two Noble Kinsmen]]''; and the two [[lost work|lost plays]], ''[[The History of Cardenio|Cardenio]]'' and ''[[Love's Labour's Won]]''.

On 23 April 1616,{{efn|Dates follow the [[Julian calendar]], used in England throughout Shakespeare's lifespan, but with the start of the year adjusted to 1 January (see [[Old Style and New Style dates]]). Under the [[Gregorian calendar]], adopted in Catholic countries in 1582, Shakespeare died on 3 May.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|p=xv}}}} [[William Shakespeare]] died in [[Stratford-upon-Avon]], and was buried in the [[chancel]] of the [[Church of the Holy Trinity, Stratford-upon-Avon|Church of the Holy Trinity]] two days later. After a long career as an actor, dramatist, and [[shareholder|sharer]] in the [[Lord Chamberlain's Men]] (later the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]]) from {{circa|1585–90}}{{efn|The exact years of his London career are unknown, but biographers suggest that it may have begun any time from the mid-1580s to just before [[Robert Greene (dramatist)|Robert Greene]] mentions Shakespeare in his ''[[Greene's Groats-Worth of Wit|Groats-Worth of Wit]]''.{{sfn|Wells|2006|p=28}}{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|pp=144–146}}{{sfn|Chambers|1930|p=59}}}} until {{circa|1610–13}},{{efn|There is a tradition, first recorded by [[Nicholas Rowe (writer)|Nicholas Rowe]] and repeated by [[Samuel Johnson|Johnson]], that Shakespeare retired to Stratford "some years before his death".{{sfn|Ackroyd|2006|p=476}} Retirement from all work was uncommon,  however, and modern biographers generally do not accord this tradition a lot of weight.{{sfn|Honan|1998|pp=382–383}} But after 1610, Shakespeare wrote fewer plays, and none are attributed to him after 1613.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|p=279}} His last three plays were collaborations, probably with [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]],{{sfn|Honan|1998|pp=375–378}} who succeeded him as the house playwright of the King's Men.{{sfn|Schoenbaum|1987|p=276}}}} he was financially well off and among England's most popular dramatists, both on the stage and in print.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2016|p=23}}{{efn|By 1623, Shakespeare’s works had been printed in 95 editions. The closest competitors were [[Thomas Dekker (writer)|Thomas Dekker]] (56), [[Thomas Middleton]] (43), and [[Ben Jonson]] (24).{{sfn|Rasmussen|2016|p=23}}}} But his reputation had not yet risen to the greatest writer in the [[English language]] and the world's pre-eminent dramatist.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2005|p=11}}{{sfn|Bevington|2002|pp=1–3}}{{sfn|Wells|1997|p=399}} [[Shakespeare's funerary monument|A funerary monument]] in Holy Trinity was commissioned, probably by [[Susanna Hall|his oldest daughter]], and installed, most likely sometime before 1617–18, but a monument in [[Poets' Corner]] in [[Westminster Abbey]]{{efn|Where [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]], [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]], and [[Francis Beaumont|Beaumont]] were buried, and where Shakespeare's contemporaries like [[Ben Jonson]] would later be either buried or memorialised.}} was not realised until 1740. [[William Basse]] wrote an elegiac poem on him {{circa|1618–20}}, but no notices were taken of his death in diplomatic correspondence or newsletters on the continent, nor were any tributes published by European contemporaries. [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]]—who at the time held the post of [[Lord Chamberlain]], with authority over the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], and directly in charge of Shakespeare as a [[Groom of the Chamber]]—made no note of his passing.{{sfn|Greenblatt|2016}}{{efn|[[Stephen Greenblatt]], in an article for ''[[The New York Review of Books]]'', points to the difference in social status: "A grand aristocrat … could [not readily] show a connection to a social nonentity—a bourgeois entrepreneur and playwright without Oxbridge honors or family distinction …."{{sfn|Greenblatt|2016}}}}

Shakespeare's works—both poetic and dramatic—had a rich history in print before the publication of the First Folio: from the first publications of ''[[Venus and Adonis (Shakespeare poem)|Venus and Adonis]]'' (1593) and ''[[The Rape of Lucrece]]'' (1594), 78 individual printed editions of his works are known. {{circa|30%}} (23) of these editions are his poetry, and the remaining {{circa|70%}} (55) his plays. Counting by number of editions published before 1623, the best-selling works were ''Venus and Adonis'' (12 editions), ''The Rape of Lucrece'' (6 editions), and ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' (6 editions). Of the 23 editions of the poems, 16 were published in [[octavo]]; the rest, and almost all of the editions of the plays, were printed in [[quarto]].{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}} The quarto format was made by folding a large sheet of printing paper twice, forming 4 leaves with 8 pages. The average quarto measured {{convert|7|by|9|in|cm}} and was made up of {{circa|9}} sheets, giving 72 total pages.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} Octavos—made by folding a sheet of the same size three times, forming 8 leaves with 16 pages—were about half as large as a quarto.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}} Since the cost of paper represented {{circa|50–75%}} of a book's total production costs,{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} octavos were generally cheaper to manufacture than quartos, and a common way to reduce publishing costs was to reduce the number of pages needed by compressing (using two columns or a smaller typeface) or abbreviating the text.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=6}}

Editions of individual plays were typically published in quarto and could be bought for 6[[Penny (English coin)|d]] ({{inflation|UK|0.025|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) without a binding. These editions were primarily intended to be cheap and convenient, and read until worn out or repurposed as wrapping paper (or worse), rather than high quality objects kept in a library.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=2–3}} Customers who wanted to keep a particular play would have to have it bound, and would typically bind several related or miscellany plays into one volume.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=10}} Octavos, though nominally cheaper to produce, were somewhat different. From {{circa|1595–6}} (''Venus and Adonis'') and 1598 (''The Rape of Lucrece''), Shakespeare's narrative poems were published in octavo.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=7}} In ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's First Folio'', Tara L. Lyons argues that this was partly due to the publisher, [[John Harrison (stationer)|John Harrison]]'s, desire to capitalize on the poems' association with [[Ovid]]: the Greek classics were sold in octavo, so printing Shakespeare's poetry in the same format would strengthen the association.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=8}} The octavo generally carried greater prestige, so the format itself would help to elevate their standing.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=7}} Ultimately, however, the choice was a financial one: ''Venus and Adonis'' in octavo needed four sheets of paper, versus seven in quarto, and the octavo ''The Rape of Lucrece'' needed five sheets, versus 12 in quarto.{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=8}} Whatever the motivation, the move seems to have had the intended effect: [[Francis Meres]], the first known literary critic to comment on Shakespeare, in his ''Palladis Tamia'' (1598), puts it thus: "the sweete wittie soule of ''Ouid'' liues in mellifluous &amp; hony-tongued ''Shakespeare'', witnes his ''Venus'' an''d'' ''Adonis'', his ''Lucrece'', his sugred Sonnets among his priuate friends".{{sfn|Lyons|2016|pp=8–9}}

Publishing literary works in folio was not unprecedented. Starting with the publication of Sir [[Philip Sidney]]'s ''[[The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia]]'' (1593) and ''[[Astrophel and Stella]]'' (1598), both published by [[William Ponsonby (publisher)|William Ponsonby]], there was a significant number of folios published, and a significant number of them were published by the men who would later be involved in publishing the First Folio.{{efn|[[Edward Fairfax]]'s translation of [[Torquato Tasso]]'s ''[[Jerusalem Delivered|Godfrey of Bulloigne]]'' (1600), [[Thomas Heywood]]'s ''[[Troia Britanica]]'' (1609), and [[Boccaccio]]’s ''[[Decameron]]'' (1620) was published in folio by [[William Jaggard|William]] and Isaac Jaggard; [[Montaigne]]’s ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essays]]'' (1603, 1613), [[Samuel Daniel]]’s ''[[Panegyricke Congratulatory]]'' (1603), [[Lucan]]’s ''[[Pharsalia]]'' (1614), and [[James Mabbe]]'s translation of [[Mateo Alemán]]’s ''[[Guzmán de Alfarache|The Rogue]]'' (1623) were published by [[Edward Blount]]; and [[John Smethwick]] published [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Ben Jonson folios|Works]]'' (1616), and [[Michael Drayton]]'s ''[[Poems (Drayton)|Poems]]'' (1619). All told, a quarter of the literary folios produced in London between 1600 and 1623 were the work of these three publishers.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2016|p=26}}}} But quarto was the typical format for plays printed in the period: folio was a prestige format, typically used, according to [[Fredson Bowers]], for books of "superior merit or some permanent value".{{sfn|Lyons|2016|p=1}} &lt;!-- TODO: Needs mention of Jonson's Folio, and perhaps a few words about Beaumont and Fletcher? Xover, 15 April 2018. --&gt;

==Printing==
The contents of the First Folio were compiled by [[John Heminges]] and [[Henry Condell]];{{sfn|Edmondson|2015|pp=321–323}} the members of the [[Worshipful Company of Stationers and Newspaper Makers|Stationers Company]] who published the book were the booksellers [[Edward Blount]] and the father/son team of [[William Jaggard|William and Isaac Jaggard]]. William Jaggard has seemed an odd choice by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] because he had published the questionable collection ''[[The Passionate Pilgrim]]'' as Shakespeare's, and in 1619 had printed new editions of 10 Shakespearean quartos to which he did not have clear rights, some with false dates and title pages (the [[False Folio]] affair). Indeed, his contemporary [[Thomas Heywood]], whose poetry Jaggard had pirated and misattributed to Shakespeare, specifically reports that Shakespeare was "much offended with M. ''Jaggard'' (that altogether unknown to him) presumed to make so bold with his name."{{sfn|Erne|2013|p=26}}

Heminges and Condell emphasised that the Folio was replacing the earlier publications, which they characterised as "stol'n and surreptitious copies, maimed and deformed by frauds and stealths of injurious impostors", asserting that Shakespeare's true words "are now offer'd to your view cured, and perfect of their limbes; and all the rest, absolute in their numbers as he conceived them."

The paper industry in England was then in its infancy and the quantity of quality [[History of paper|rag paper]] for the book was imported from France.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|p=41}} It is thought that the [[typesetting]] and printing of the First Folio was such a large job that the King's Men simply needed the capacities of the Jaggards' shop. William Jaggard was old, infirm and blind by 1623, and died a month before the book went on sale; most of the work in the project must have been done by his son Isaac.

The First Folio's publishing syndicate also included two stationers who owned the rights to some of the individual plays that had been previously printed: [[William Aspley]] (''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' and ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'') and [[John Smethwick]] (''[[Love's Labour's Lost]],'' ''[[Romeo and Juliet]],'' and ''[[Hamlet]]''). Smethwick had been a business partner of another Jaggard, William's brother John.

The printing of the Folio was probably done between February 1622 and early November 1623. It is possible that the printer originally expected to have the book ready early, since it was listed in the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] catalogue as a book to appear between April and October 1622, but the catalog contained many books not yet printed by 1622, and the modern consensus is that the entry was simply intended as advance publicity.{{sfn|Higgins|2016|p=42–44}} The first impression had a publication date of 1623, and the earliest record of a retail purchase is an account book entry for 5 December 1623 of [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Edward Dering]] (who purchased two); the [[Bodleian Library]], in [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], received its copy in early 1624 (which it subsequently sold for £24 as a superseded edition when the [[Folios and Quartos (Shakespeare)|Third Folio]] became available in 1663/1664).{{sfn|Smith|1939|pp=257–264}}

==Contents==
The 36 plays of the First Folio occur in the order given below; plays that had never been published before 1623 are marked with an asterisk. Each play is followed by the type of source used, as determined by bibliographical research.{{sfn|Evans|1974}}&lt;!-- FIXME: This needs better, more up to date and specific, sourcing. This cite, as it stands, covers the entire list of plays below. So it should be replaced with specific cites to a modern edition for each play listed. Xover, 31 March 2018. --&gt;

The term ''[[foul papers]]'' refers to Shakespeare's working drafts of a play. When completed, a transcript or ''fair copy'' of the foul papers would be prepared, by the author or by a scribe. Such a manuscript would have to be heavily annotated with accurate and detailed stage directions and all the other data needed for performance, and then could serve as a ''[[prompt book]]'', to be used by the [[Prompter (theatre)|prompter]] to guide a performance of the play. Any of these manuscripts, in any combination, could be used as a source for a printed text. On rare occasions a printed text might be annotated for use as a prompt book, as may have been the case with ''A Midsummer Night's Dream''.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} The label Q''n'' denotes the ''n''th quarto edition of a play.

;Comedies
* 1 ''[[The Tempest]]'' * – the play was set into type from a manuscript prepared by [[Ralph Crane]], a professional [[scrivener]] employed by the King's Men. Crane produced a high-quality result, with formal act/scene divisions, frequent use of parentheses and hyphenated forms, and other identifiable features.
* 2 ''[[The Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' * – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
* 3 ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
* 4 ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' * – probably another Ralph Crane transcript.
* 5 ''[[The Comedy of Errors]]'' * – probably typeset from Shakespeare's "foul papers," lightly annotated.
* 6 ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' – typeset from a copy of the quarto, lightly annotated.
* 7 ''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'' – typeset from a corrected copy of Q1.
* 8 ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' – typeset from a copy of Q2, well-annotated, possibly used as a prompt-book.
* 9 ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' – typeset from a lightly edited and corrected copy of Q1.
* 10 ''[[As You Like It]]'' * – from a quality manuscript, lightly annotated by a prompter.
* 11 ''[[The Taming of the Shrew]]'' * – typeset from Shakespeare's "foul papers," somewhat annotated, perhaps as preparation for use as a prompt-book.
* 12 ''[[All's Well That Ends Well]]'' * – probably from Shakespeare's "foul papers" or a manuscript of them.
* 13 ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' * – typeset either from a prompt-book or a transcript of one.
* 14 ''[[The Winter's Tale]]'' * – another transcript by Ralph Crane.
;Histories
* 15 ''[[The Life and Death of King John|King John]]'' * – uncertain: a prompt-book, or "foul papers."
* 16 ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'' – typeset from Q3 and Q5, corrected against a prompt-book.
* 17 ''[[Henry IV, Part 1]]'' – typeset from an edited copy of Q5.
* 18 ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' – uncertain: some combination of manuscript and quarto text.
* 19 ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]'' – typeset from Shakespeare's "foul papers."
* 20 ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' * – likely from an annotated transcript of the author's manuscript.
* 21 ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]'' – probably a Shakespearean manuscript used as a prompt-book.
* 22 ''[[Henry VI, Part 3]]'' – like 2H6, probably a Shakespearean prompt-book.
* 23 ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'' – a difficult case: probably typeset partially from Q3, and partially from Q6 corrected against a manuscript (maybe "foul papers").
* 24 ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' * – typeset from a fair copy of the authors' manuscript.
;Tragedies
* 25 ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'' – probably typeset from the quarto, corrected with Shakespeare's "foul papers," printed after the rest of the Folio was completed.
* 26 ''[[Coriolanus]]'' * – set from a high-quality authorial transcript.
* 27 ''[[Titus Andronicus]]'' – typeset from a copy of Q3 that might have served as a prompt-book.
* 28 ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' – in essence a reprint of Q3.
* 29 ''[[Timon of Athens]]'' * – set from Shakespeare's foul papers or a transcript of them.
* 30 ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' * – set from a prompt-book, or a transcript of a prompt-book.
* 31 ''[[Macbeth]]'' * – probably set from a prompt-book, perhaps detailing an adaptation of the play for a short indoor performance
* 32 ''[[Hamlet]]'' – one of the most difficult problems in the First Folio: probably typeset from some combination of Q2 and manuscript sources.
* 33 ''[[King Lear]]'' – a difficult problem: probably set mainly from Q1 but with reference to Q2, and corrected against a prompt-book.
* 34 ''[[Othello]]'' – another difficult problem: probably typeset from Q1, corrected with a quality manuscript.
* 35 ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' * – possibly "foul papers" or a transcript of them.
* 36 ''[[Cymbeline]]'' * – possibly another Ralph Crane transcript, or else the official prompt-book.

''Troilus and Cressida'' was originally intended to follow ''Romeo and Juliet'', but the typesetting was stopped, probably due to a conflict over the rights to the play; it was later inserted as the first of the tragedies, when the rights question was resolved. It does not appear in the table of contents.{{sfn|Halliday|1964}}{{pn|date=March 2018}}

==Introductory Poem==
[[Ben Jonson]] wrote a preface to the folio with this poem facing the Droeshout portrait:
{{Poemquote|text=This Figure, that thou here seest put,
It was for gentle Shakespeare cut:
 Wherein the Grauer had a strife
 with Nature, to out-doo the life:
 O, could he but haue dravvne his vvit
 As vvell in brasse, as he hath hit
 His face; the Print vvould then surpasse
 All, that vvas euer vvrit in brasse.
 But, since he cannot, Reader, looke
 Not on his picture, but his Booke.

B.J.}}

==Compositors==
As far as modern scholarship has been able to determine,{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=113}} the First Folio texts were set into type by five compositors, with different spelling habits, peculiarities, and levels of competence. Researchers have labelled them A through E, A being the most accurate, and E an apprentice who had significant difficulties in dealing with manuscript copy. Their shares in typesetting the pages of the Folio break down like this:

Compositor "E" was most likely one John Leason, whose apprenticeship contract dated only from 4 November 1622. One of the other four might have been a John Shakespeare, of [[Warwickshire]], who apprenticed with Jaggard in 1610–17. ("Shakespeare" was a common name in Warwickshire in that era; John was no known relation to the playwright.)

== The First Folio and variants ==
[[File:First Folio VA.jpg|thumb|The First Folio ([[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London)]]
[[W. W. Greg]] has argued that [[Edward Knight (King's Men)|Edward Knight]], the "book-keeper" or "book-holder" ([[prompter (theatre)|prompter]]) of the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]], did the actual proofreading of the manuscript sources for the First Folio. Knight is known to have been responsible for maintaining and annotating the company's scripts, and making sure that the company complied with cuts and changes ordered by the [[Master of the Revels]].

Some pages of the First Folio – 134 out of the total of 900 – were proofread and corrected while the job of printing the book was ongoing. As a result, the Folio differs from modern books in that individual copies vary considerably in their typographical errors. There were about 500 corrections made to the Folio in this way.{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=390}} These corrections by the typesetters, however, consisted only of simple typos, clear mistakes in their own work; the evidence suggests that they almost never referred back to their manuscript sources, let alone tried to resolve any problems in those sources. The well-known [[crux (literary)|cruxes]] in the First Folio texts were beyond the typesetters' capacity to correct.

The Folio was typeset and bound in "sixes" – 3 sheets of paper, taken together, were folded into a booklet-like quire or gathering of 6 leaves, 12 pages. Once printed, the "sixes" were assembled and bound together to make the book. The sheets were printed in 2-page formes, meaning that pages 1 and 12 of the first quire were printed simultaneously on one side of one sheet of paper (which became the "outer" side); then pages 2 and 11 were printed on the other side of the same sheet (the "inner" side). The same was done with pages 3 and 10, and 4 and 9, on the second sheet, and pages 5 and 8, and 6 and 7, on the third. Then the first quire could be assembled with its pages in the correct order. The next quire was printed by the same method: pages 13 and 24 on one side of one sheet, etc. This meant that the text being printed had to be "cast off" – the compositors had to plan beforehand how much text would fit onto each page. If the compositors were setting type from manuscripts (perhaps messy, revised and corrected manuscripts), their calculations would frequently be off by greater or lesser amounts, resulting in the need to expand or compress. A line of verse could be printed as two; or verse could be printed as prose to save space, or lines and passages could even be omitted (a disturbing prospect for those who prize Shakespeare's works).{{sfn|Halliday|1964|p=319}}

== Performing Shakespeare using the First Folio ==

Some Shakespeare directors and theatre companies producing Shakespeare believe that while modern editions of Shakespeare's plays, which are heavily edited and changed, are more readable, they remove possible actor cues found in the Folio, such as capitalization, different punctuation and even the changing or removal of whole words. Among the theatre companies that have based their production approach upon use of the First Folio was the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]], which, in the early 1980s, began a studied approach to their stage productions relying upon the First Folio as their textual guide. In the 1990s, the First Folio was reissued in a paperback format more accessible to the general public.{{sfn|Moston|1995|p=vii}}{{fv|date=April 2018|reason=The introduction starts on page ix, so page vii must be some other prefatory matter, possibly the publisher's sales copy for the book. The cite also only plausibly covers the last sentence of this paragraph.}}

Today, many theatre companies and festivals producing the works of Shakespeare use the First Folio as the basis for their theatrical productions and training programmes, including London's Original Shakespeare Company, a theatre company which works exclusively from cue scripts drawn from the First Folio.{{sfn|Tucker|2002|p=}}{{pn|date=April 2018}}

However, what are now the widely accepted versions of these plays include lines taken from the Quartos, which are not in the First Folio. For instance, small passages of ''Hamlet'' are omitted – among them Horatio's line "A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye", and his subsequent speech beginning with "In the most high and palmy state of Rome, / A little ere the mightiest Julius fell..." Also missing is Hamlet's encounter with the Norwegian captain from Fortinbras's army in Act IV, Scene IV, along with perhaps the most important cut, the soliloquy "How all occasions do inform against me". ''Romeo and Juliet'' omits the prologue, with its famous line about "a pair of [[star-crossed]] lovers".

==Holdings, sales and valuations==
Jean-Christophe Mayer, in ''The Cambridge Companion to Shakespeare's First Folio'' (2016), estimates the original retail price of the First Folio to be about 15[[Shilling (English coin)|s]] ({{inflation|UK|0.75|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) for an unbound copy, and up to [[pound sterling|£]]1 ({{inflation|UK|1|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}) for one bound in [[calfskin]].{{efn|He also cites previous estimates from Anthony James West, based in part on unpublished estimates by Peter Blayney, that the publisher's cost was about 6s 8[[Penny (English coin)|d]] ({{inflation|UK|0.33|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}), and the wholesale price no more than 10s ({{inflation|UK|0.5|1623|fmt=eq|cursign=£}}).{{sfn|Mayer|2016|p=105}}&lt;!-- FIXME: The modern prices, generated by [[Template:inflation]], need citations. But [[Template:inflation-fn]] currently doesn't support short footnotes, and a few other problems, so that will have to be addressed first. Xover, 4 April 2018. --&gt;}} In terms of [[purchasing power]], "a bound folio would be about forty times the price of a single play and represented almost two months’ wages for an ordinary skilled worker."{{sfn|Mayer|2016|p=105}}

It is believed that around 750 copies of the First Folio were printed, of which there are 235 known surviving copies.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}}{{sfn|The Guardian|2016}}{{sfn|Folgerpedia|n.d.}} The [[British Library]] holds 5 copies. The [[National Library of Scotland]] holds a single copy, donated by the [[Society of Antiquaries of Scotland]] in 1949.{{sfn|Vincent|2016}} An incomplete copy is on display at the [[Craven Museum &amp; Gallery]] in [[Skipton]], [[North Yorkshire]] and is accompanied by an audio narrative by [[Patrick Stewart]].{{sfn|BBC|2011}} The [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] in Washington, D.C. holds the world's largest collection with 82 copies. Another collection (12 copies) is held at [[Meisei University]] in [[Tokyo]], including the ''Meisei Copy'' (coded MR 774), said to be unique because of annotations by its reader.{{sfn|Meisei University|n.d.}} While most copies are held in university libraries or museums such as the copy held by the [[Brandeis University]] library since 1961,{{sfn|Farber|2013}} a few are held by public libraries. In the United States, the [[New York Public Library]] has six copies{{sfn|West|2003|p=222}} with the [[Boston Public Library]],{{sfn|West|2003|p=204}} [[Free Library of Philadelphia]],{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=721}} [[The Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign)]],{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=585}} the [[Lilly Library]] ([[Indiana University-Bloomington]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/regina-fraser-and-pat-johnson/an-extraordinary-library-_2_b_8210410.html&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Dallas Public Library]]{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=757}} each holding one copy.
The [[Huntington Library]] in Los Angeles County has four copies.{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|p=230-240}} In Canada, there is only one known copy, located in the [[Thomas Fisher Rare Book Library]] of the [[University of Toronto]].{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|pp=770–771}} The former Rosenbach copy, in its original binding, is now held at the [[Bodmer Library|Fondation Martin Bodmer]] in Switzerland.{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|pp=851–854}} The [[State Library of New South Wales]] holds copies of the First, Second, Third and Fourth Folios.{{sfn|Rasmussen|West|2012|pp=772–773}}

The First Folio is one of the most valuable printed books in the world: a copy sold at [[Christie's]] in New York in October 2001 made $6.16 million [[Auction#Terminology|hammer price]] (then £3.73m).{{sfn|Christie's|2001}}

[[Oriel College, Oxford]], raised a conjectured £3.5 million from the sale of its First Folio to [[John Paul Getty, Jr.|Sir Paul Getty]] in 2003.

To commemorate the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death in 2016, the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]] toured some of its 82 First Folios for display in all 50 U.S. states, Washington, D.C. and Puerto Rico.{{sfn|Fessenden|2016}}

===Discoveries of previously unknown Folios===
On 13 July 2006, a complete copy of the First Folio owned by [[Dr Williams's Library]] was auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] auction house. The book, which was in its original 17th-century binding, sold for £2,808,000, less than Sotheby's top estimate of £3.5 million. This copy is one of only about 40 remaining complete copies (most of the existing copies are incomplete); only one other copy of the book remains in private ownership.{{sfn|Iggulden|2006}}

On 11 July 2008, it was reported that a copy stolen from [[Durham University]], England, in 1998 had been recovered after being submitted for valuation at the [[Folger Shakespeare Library]]. News reports estimated the folio's value at anywhere from £250,000 in total for the First Folio and all the other books and manuscripts stolen (''[[BBC News]]'', 1998), up to $30 million (''[[New York Times]]'', 2008).{{sfn|Collins|2008}} Although the book, once the property of [[John Cosin]] the [[Bishop of Durham]], was returned to the library, it had been mutilated and was missing its cover and title page.{{sfn|Wainwright|2010}} The folio was returned to public display on 19 June 2010 after its twelve-year absence.{{sfn|Macknight|2010}} Fifty-three-year-old Raymond Scott received an eight-year prison sentence for [[handling stolen goods]], but was acquitted of the theft itself.{{sfn|Rasmussen|2011|p=43}} A July 2010 BBC programme about the affair, ''Stealing Shakespeare'', portrayed Scott as a fantasist and petty thief.{{sfn|Rees|2010}} In 2013, Scott killed himself in his prison cell.{{sfn|BBC|2013}}

In November 2014, a previously unknown First Folio was found in a public library in [[Saint-Omer]], [[Pas-de-Calais]] in [[France]], where it had lain for 200 years.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}}{{sfn|BBC|2014}} Confirmation of its authenticity came from Eric Rasmussen, of the [[University of Nevada, Reno]], one of the world's foremost authorities on Shakespeare.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}}{{sfn|BBC|2014}} The title page and introductory material are missing.{{sfn|BBC|2014}}{{sfn|Mulholland|2014}} The name "Neville", written on the first surviving page, may indicate that it once belonged to Edward Scarisbrick, who fled England due to [[Recusancy|anti-Catholic repression]], attended the Jesuit [[Saint-Omer College]], and was known to use that alias.{{sfn|Schuessler|2014}} The only other known copy of a First Folio in France is in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France|National Library]] in Paris.{{sfn|Mulholland|2014}}

In March 2016, [[Christie's]] announced that a previously unrecorded copy once owned by 19th-century collector Sir George Augustus Shuckburgh-Evelyn would be auctioned on 25 May 2016.{{sfn|Finnigan|2016}}

In April 2016 another new discovery was announced, a First Folio having been found in [[Mount Stuart House]] on the [[Isle of Bute]], [[Scotland]]. It was authenticated by [[Emma J. Smith|Professor Emma Smith]] of Oxford University.{{sfn|Coughlan|2016}} The Folio originally belonged to [[Isaac Reed]].{{sfn|Smith|2016}}

The '''German Reference Corpus''' (original: '''Deutsches Referenzkorpus'''; short: '''DeReKo''') is an electronic archive of [[text corpus|text corpora]] of [[German language|contemporary written German]]. It was first created in 1964 and is hosted at the Institute for the German Language (IDS) in [[Mannheim]], [[Germany]]. The corpus archive is continuously updated and expanded. It currently comprises more than 4.0 billion word tokens (as of August 2010) and constitutes the largest linguistically motivated collection of contemporary German texts. Today, it is one of the major resources worldwide for the study of written German.

==Alternative names==

The German Reference Corpus is often referred to by other names, such as ''Mannheim corpora'', ''IDS corpora'', ''COSMAS corpora'' and the corresponding German translations. The name ''Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)'' was originally used for a specific portion of the current archive which was collected between 1999 and 2002 by a number of institutions in a joint project under the same name. Since 2004, ''Deutsches Referenzkorpus (DeReKo)'' is the official name of the full corpus archive.

==Conception and composition==

The German Reference Corpus comprises fictional and academic texts, a large number of newspaper texts and several other text types. The texts cover the time range from around 1950 to the present.

In contrast to other well-known corpora and corpus archives (such as the [[British National Corpus]]), however, the German Reference Corpus is explicitly not designed as a ''balanced corpus'': The distribution of DeReKo texts across time or text types does not match some predefined percentages.

This conception complies with the fact that whether or not a given corpus constitutes a balanced or even representative language [[sample (statistics)|sample]] may only be assessed with respect to a specific language domain (i.e., the [[statistical population]]). Because different linguistic investigations generally aim at different language domains, the declared purpose of the German Reference Corpus is to serve as a versatile superordinate sample, or ''[[primordial sample]]'' (German: ''Ur-Stichprobe'') of contemporary written German, from which corpus users may draw a specialised subsample (a so-called ''[[virtual corpus]]'') to represent the language domain they wish to investigate.

==Access==

Due to copyright and licence restrictions, the DeReKo archive may not be copied nor offered for download. It can be queried and analyzed free of charge via the system ''COSMAS II'' - end-users are required to register by name and to agree to use the corpus data exclusively for non-commercial, academic purposes. ''COSMAS II'' enables users to compile from DeReKo a ''virtual corpus'' suitable for their specific research questions.

The '''Globalization and World Cities Research Network''', commonly abbreviated to '''GaWC''', is a [[think tank]] that studies the relationships between [[global city|world cities]] in the context of [[globalization]]. It is based in the [[geography]] department of [[Loughborough University]] in [[Leicestershire]], [[England]], [[United Kingdom]]. GaWC was founded by [[Peter J. Taylor]] in 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter J.|title=World city network: a global urban analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RKpvD7nvBKUC&amp;pg=PR9|accessdate=2010-10-10|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-30249-8|page=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Together with Jon Beaverstock and [[Richard G. Smith (geographer)|Richard G. Smith]], they create the GaWC's bi-annual categorization of world cities into "Alpha", "Beta" and "Gamma" tiers, based upon their international connectedness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Donald|first1=Stephanie|last2=Gammack|first2=John G.|title=Tourism and the branded city|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gcAx3bjuC98C&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=2010-10-10|year=2007 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |location=London|isbn=0-7546-4829-X|page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GaWC examines cities worldwide to narrow them down to a roster of world cities, then ranks these based on their connectivity through four "advanced producer services": accountancy, advertising, banking/finance, and law.&lt;ref name = "intro"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018link.html |title=GaWC – The World According to GaWC 2018|publisher=Lboro.ac.uk |date= 13 November 2018|accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GaWC inventory ranks city [[economics]] more heavily than political or cultural factors. Beyond the categories of "Alpha" world cities (with four sub-categories), "Beta" world cities (three sub-categories) and "Gamma" world cities (three sub-categories), the GaWC cities include additional cities at "High sufficiency" and "Sufficiency" level.

The 2004 rankings added several new indicators while continuing to rank city [[economics]] more heavily than political or cultural factors. The 2008 roster, similar to the 1998 version, is sorted into categories of Alpha world cities (with four sub-categories), Beta world cities (three sub-categories), Gamma world cities (three sub-categories) and additional cities with High sufficiency or Sufficiency presence. 

== 2018 city classification ==
The cities in the 2018 classification are as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lboro.ac.uk/gawc/world2018t.html|title=The World According to GaWC 2018|date=14 Nov 2018|publisher=GaWC|accessdate=14 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Graham technique''' is a [[modern dance]] movement style and pedagogy created by American dancer and choreographer [[Martha&amp;nbsp;Graham]] (1894–1991).&lt;ref name="Norton"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za1FwfU4tVUC&amp;pg=PA371 | title=The Norton Dictionary of Modern Thought | publisher=W.

Graham technique is based on the opposition between contraction and release, a concept based on the [[breathing]] cycle which has become a "trademark" of modern dance forms.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kassing"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kassing | first=G. | last2=Jay | first2=D.M. | title=Dance Teaching Methods and Curriculum Design | publisher=Human Kinetics | year=2003 | isbn=978-0-7360-0240-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bTm-W4oX0HgC&amp;pg=PA38 | page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its other dominant principle is the "spiraling" of the torso around the axis of the spine.&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt; Graham technique is known for its unique dramatic and expressive qualities and distinctive [[floorwork]];&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt; dance critic [[Anna Kisselgoff]] described it as "powerful, dynamic, jagged and filled with tension."&lt;ref name="Kisselgoff"&gt;{{cite news | last=Kisselgoff | first=Anna | title=Martha Graham Dies at 96; A Revolutionary in Dance | work=The New York Times | date=2 April 1991 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0511.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Find a more authoritative name to drop here; maybe Helpern --&gt;

The phrase "Graham technique" was registered as a [[trademark]] before Graham's death, and was the subject of a trademark dispute in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="rights" /&gt;

===Contraction and release===
The fundamental movement of Graham technique is the cycle between "contraction" and subsequent "release", which developed as a stylized representation of [[breathing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=LaMothe|first1=Kimerer L.|title=Nietzsche's Dancers: Isadora Duncan, Martha Graham, and the Revaluation of Christian Values|date=2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781403977267|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gubFAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the "fall and recovery" dualism of [[Doris Humphrey]]'s technique, it is one of the most important concepts in early modern dance.&lt;ref name="Foulkes"&gt;{{cite book|author=Julia L.

|quote="Pull, pull on the contraction. Do not cave in. And the contraction is not a position. It is a movement into something. It is like a pebble thrown into the water, which makes rippling circles when it hits the water. The contraction moves."

}}

A classic Graham contraction is a movement originating from the deep [[pelvic floor|pelvic&amp;nbsp;muscles]]. These muscles, along with the [[Abdomen#Muscles|abdominal muscles]], pull the [[human vertebral column|spine]] into a [[:wikt:concave|concave]] arc from the [[coccyx]] to the [[nape]] of the neck, with the pelvis tucked and shoulders forward.&lt;ref name="Reynolds"&gt;{{cite book | editor= Lisa Rado |last=Reynolds | first=Dee |chapter=Dancing Free: Women's Movements in Early Modern Dance | title=Modernism, Gender, and Culture: A Cultural Studies Approach | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-136-51553-8 | pages=263–274}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bannerman99" /&gt; The spine grows longer, not shorter, in a contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Macel |first1=Emily |title=Interview with Terese Capucilli |journal=Dance Magazine |date=July 2009 |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/july-2009/Terese-Capucilli |accessdate=12 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402193454/http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/july-2009/Terese-Capucilli |archivedate=2 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The force of the contraction can be used to move the body through space or change its trajectory.&lt;ref name="Thomas"/&gt; The release may be considered a relatively passive return to a "normal" state, or alternatively an equally active outward propulsion of energy.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Terry | first=W. | title=I was there: selected dance reviews and articles--1936-1976 | publisher=Audience Arts | series=The Dance program | year=1978 | isbn=978-0-8247-6524-8 |pages=53–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contraction is associated with the exhale, and the release with the inhale, although this connection may be merely conceptual.&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt;

The [[Indexicality|indexical]] meaning of the contraction in Graham's choreography is generally that the dancer is overcome with emotion, although the details depend on the specific context.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;

Graham's decision to make movement originate from the core rather than [[distal]]ly echoes the style of [[Isadora Duncan]], but Duncan wrote in [[My Life (Isadora Duncan autobiography)|her autobiography]] that movement originates in the [[solar plexus]] rather than the low abdomen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lang |first=Pearl |authorlink=Pearl Lang | editor=Horosko, M. | title=Martha Graham: The Evolution of Her Dance Theory and Training, 1926-1991 | publisher=Chicago Review Press | year=1991 | isbn=978-1-55652-142-3 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Spiraling===
The second fundamental concept in Graham technique is the [[spiral]]. The basic "spiraling" position consists of rotating the spine approximately 45° around its vertical axis, so that a dancer facing the front of the stage would have their shoulders aligned with the "Via Triumphalis", an imaginary line parallel to a corner-to-corner diagonal of the stage.&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt; In a "hip spiral", the movement initiates subtly from the [[hip]] and builds to maximum tension by pulling the opposing [[scapula|shoulder blade]] away from the initiating hip.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;

===Falls===
{{quote box|bgcolor=#FFFFF0|width=20%|align=right|salign=right
|quote="Falling is not a literal representation of reality, but instead an embodiment of inner experience; not a reductive language, but a poetic language that derives its meaning from the layering of the physical and psychic."
|source=Former Graham dancer Ellen Graff, 2004&lt;ref name="Graff" /&gt;
}}
Like other early modern choreographers, Graham used [[floorwork]] to explore the themes of weight and gravity in new ways;&lt;ref name="Graff"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Graff | first=Ellen | title=When your heart falls: The drama of descent in Martha Graham's technique and theater | journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory | volume=14 | issue=1 | year=2004 | pages=107–115 | url=http://marthagraham.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Falling-by-Ellen-Graff.pdf | doi=10.1080/07407700408571443}}&lt;/ref&gt; European students were "shocked" when [[Anna Sokolow]] introduced them to Graham's "percussive" falling techniques in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="Partsch-Bergsohn"&gt;{{cite book | last=Partsch-Bergsohn | first=I. | title=Modern Dance in Germany and the United States: Crosscurrents and Influences | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | series=Choreography and Dance Studies Series | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-134-35821-2 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ecn9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR15 | page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Graham falls use contractions and manipulate the body's [[center of gravity]], in order to control the timing and direction of a fall.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt; There are a wide range of strictly codified Graham falls, including sitting and traveling falls; falls from elevation; and standing falls, which may be directed forward, backwards, to the side, or into a split.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt; In almost all falls, the dancer exerts a strong upward force to counteract the force of gravity and suspend the body in space for artistic effect.&lt;ref name="Graff"/&gt;

Graham falls can be used for dramatic effect, taking meaning in a choreographic context from manipulating the balance between actively suspending the body and surrendering to gravity.&lt;ref name="Graff" /&gt;

===Other aspects===
Graham technique uses the [[hand]]s in distinctive ways. They are generally meant to be active and purposeful, not decorative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Daly|first1=Ann|title=Critical Gestures: Writings on Dance and Culture|date=2002|publisher=Wesleyan University Press|isbn=9780819565662|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k_g6IG0HIhoC&amp;lpg=PA158&amp;dq=%22Graham%20technique%22%20hands&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are often held in a stylized, cupped position, with the fingers held straight and pulled towards the palm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Guest|first1=Ann Hutchinson|title=Your Move|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135800055|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f2ezz6bEvcAC&amp;pg=PA89}} (with illustration of Graham-contracted hand)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Franklin|first1=Eric N.|title=Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery|date=2012|publisher=Human Kinetics|isbn=9780736067898|page=333|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBwV_g8DhEMC&amp;lpg=PA333&amp;dq=%22Graham%20technique%22%20hands%20feet&amp;pg=PA333}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arm]]s typically move in response to impetus from the back or shoulders. Arm movements were often left unspecified in Graham's early work, and there is variation between Graham teachers' use of ''[[port de bras]]'' (carriage of the arms).&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;{{rp|12}}

==Analysis==

Graham technique is designed to make its dancers expressive and dramatic. Its movement vocabulary draws connections between the physical and emotional meanings of "power", "control", and "vulnerability".&lt;ref name="Hart-Johnson" /&gt; Movement initiates from the core, incorporating large back movements and [[floorwork|dancing on the floor]].&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gould |first1=Karen |editor1=Goethals, George R.|editor2=Sorensen, Georgia|editor3=Burns, James MacGregor|title=Encyclopedia of Leadership|volume=1|date=2004|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780761925972|page=594|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kjLspnsZS4UC&amp;pg=PA594}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique highlights weight and effort; according to Marian Horosko, "the body had to appear to be pushing through a heavy mass, much like the pressure confronted when walking through water."&lt;ref name="Horosko"&gt;{{cite book | last=Horosko | first=M. | title=Martha Graham: The Evolution of Her Dance Theory and Training, 1926-1991 | publisher=Chicago Review Press | year=1991 | isbn=978-1-55652-142-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The technique's "earthbound" and "assertive" character initially drew strong criticism. In a "vehement" 1934 review, [[Lincoln Kirstein]] wrote: "Her jumps are jolts; her walks, limps and staggers; her runs, blind impulsive gallops; her bends, sways," and called the effect "stark, earth-ridden, gaunt, inward-eyed."&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kane"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kane |first= Angela |title= Episodes (1959): Entente Cordiale? |journal= Dance Research |volume=25 |issue=1 |issn= 1750-0095 |pages= 54–72 |doi=10.1353/dar.2007.0020}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Graham was strongly promoted by dance critic [[John Martin (dance critic)|John Martin]], who helped her to win a popular following.&lt;ref name="Conner"&gt;{{cite book | last=Conner | first=L. | title= Spreading the gospel of the modern dance: newspaper dance criticism in the United States, 1850-1934 |publisher= University of Pittsburgh Press | year=1997 |accessdate= 21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graham was exceptionally flexible, and many of her technique's exaggerated movements can be difficult or painful to execute.&lt;ref name="Parviainen"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Parviainen |first= Jaana |title=Bodies Moving and Moved |type= |page=99 |url=http://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/68138/951-44-5595-9.pdf?sequence=1|year=1998 |publisher=[[Tampere University]] Press |access-date=12 Mar 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship to ballet===

Graham is considered a "codified technique", like the several schools of classical [[ballet]].&lt;ref name="Thomas"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Helen|title=The Body, Dance and Cultural Theory|date=2003|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137487773|page=112|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jlkdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Van Dyke|first1=Jan|title=Modern dance in a postmodern world|date=1992|publisher=National Dance Association|isbn=9780883145258|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are major differences between Graham and ballet techniques.

Graham dancers are trained to highlight their effort and use weight as a dramatic tool, while ballet dancers strive to appear weightless and effortless.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham technique's use of large torso movements and floorwork represent further breaks from the balletic tradition.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Graham explained that, although she respected the advances made in the course of ballet history, "Ballet…did not say enough, especially when it came to intense drama, to passion."&lt;ref name ="Freedman"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=Russell|title=Martha Graham: A Dancer's Life|date=1998|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780395746554|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LauOC7vYx-gC&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;ots=e3LM_2BYW_&amp;dq=%22martha%20graham%22%20%22graham%20technique%22&amp;lr&amp;pg=PA56}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} However, her extended collaboration with ballet-trained [[Erick Hawkins]] made her technique more balletic over time.&lt;ref name =Bannerman99/&gt;{{rp|23}}

===Gender===
The technique was originally developed on an all-female company, although the company later included men.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham sometimes criticized her dancers for failing to initiate from the pelvis, or as she sometimes put it, "move from the vagina";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scherr|first1=Apollinaire|title=DANCE; Making a Career With One Eye on a Gender Gap|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/04/arts/dance-making-a-career-with-one-eye-on-a-gender-gap.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=4 November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; the connection between Graham technique and the female pelvis led one of Graham's male dancers to develop "vagina envy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bannerman|first1=Henrietta|title=Martha Graham's House of the Pelvic Truth: The Figuration of Sexual Identities and Female Empowerment|journal=Dance Research Journal|date=2010|volume=42|issue=1|pages=30–45|doi=10.1017/S0149767700000814|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8511717|accessdate=12 March 2015}} "The contraction as described above encloses the vagina and the womb.…a male dancer claimed to have "vagina envy"' no doubt because he was unable to obey that particular female-centered instruction.…Vagina envy may have represented the male dancer’s desire for the type of pelvic flexibility that lends itself best to Graham's style."&lt;/ref&gt; The pelvic origin of the contraction contributes to the role of [[sexuality]] in Graham technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Bullough | first=V.L. | last2=Bullough | first2=B. | title=Human Sexuality: An Encyclopedia | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | year=2014 | isbn=978-1-135-82502-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-cqlAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163 | page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Feminism|Feminist]] dance scholar [[Dee Reynolds (scholar)|Dee Reynolds]] has argued that, because Graham technique was "so large and forceful, thrusting into and conquering space," it allowed Graham and her early all-female company to "redefine femininity as powerful and autonomous."&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt; Reynolds also noted that the idea of "moving from the vagina" is similar to late nineteenth-century ideas about "[[female hysteria]]," a supposed sexual disorder sometimes linked to dancing, and Graham's contractions could be seen as reclaiming the female body as an artistic medium.&lt;ref name="Reynolds" /&gt;

==Influence on modern dance==
Graham, along with [[Doris Humphrey]], [[Helen Tamiris]], [[Agnes de Mille]], and others, was part of an artistic movement in dance which rejected both the centuries-old tradition of classical [[ballet]] and the first-generation rebels of [[modern dance]], such as those who taught at the [[Denishawn school]] where Graham studied.&lt;ref name="Freedman" /&gt;{{rp|47}}

The expressive force of Graham technique had a revolutionary effect on modern dance.&lt;ref name="Gould" /&gt; Graham is now taught in most university dance programs, and remains the "hallmark" style of contemporary [[concert dance]]; its movement vocabulary is familiar to almost all professional contemporary dancers.&lt;ref name="TIME" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith-Autard" /&gt; It strongly influenced several other codified techniques, notably those of [[Merce Cunningham]], [[Lester Horton]], and [[Paul Taylor (choreographer)|Paul Taylor]].&lt;ref name="McFee"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McFee|first1=Graham|title=Understanding Dance|date=2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134899463|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YzauVU0RRE4C&amp;lpg=PT201&amp;dq=evolution%20of%20cunningham%20technique%20owes%20a%20debt%20to%20graham%20technique&amp;pg=PT201#v=onepage&amp;q=evolution%20of%20cunningham%20technique%20owes%20a%20debt%20to%20graham%20technique}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perces"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Perces|first1=Marjorie B.|last2=Forsythe|first2=Ana Marie|last3=Bell|first3=Cheryl|title=The Dance Technique of Lester Horton|date=1992|publisher=Princeton Book Company|isbn=9780871271648|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harss"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Harss|first1=Marina|title=A Form of Order: On Paul Taylor|publisher=The Nation|date=12 September 2012|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/169891/form-order-paul-taylor|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
Graham developed a daily class for her company, which is still used (with some variations) to teach her technique.&lt;ref name ="Butterworth" &gt;{{cite book|last1=Butterworth|first1=Jo|title=Dance Studies: The Basics|date=2011|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136584060|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpfHBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT17&amp;dq=%22graham+technique%22+%22modern+dance%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Traiger|first1=Lisa|title=Common Ground: 5 Modern Techniques for the 21st Century|journal=Dance Studio Life|date=6 March 2008|url=http://www.dancestudiolife.com/common-ground-5-modern-techniques-for-the-21st-century/|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The class is organized as follows:

*'''[[Floor work]]''' Students stand to salute the teacher as she or he enters, then work on the floor for thirty to forty minutes. Students begin with "bounces" of the torso in three seated positions, and perform contraction exercises and kneeling combinations. The floor exercises emphasize core strength and stability, explore the articulation of the spine and torso, and start to coordinate the arms, legs and head.&lt;ref name="BannermanSomatics"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bannerman | first=Henrietta | title=A question of somatics the search for a common framework for twenty-first-century contemporary dance pedagogy: Graham and Release-based techniques | journal=Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices | volume=2 | issue=1 | year=2010 | pages=5–19 | doi=10.1386/jdsp.2.1.5_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Standing exercises''' The floorwork exercises transition up to standing combinations, which work the legs, feet, and torso, and train balance and control.
*'''Across the floor''' These traveling combinations begin with simple walking exercises, and increase in complexity to include jumps and leaping turns. Students traditionally consider this section an opportunity for "real" dancing, in contrast to the other sections' duly executed technical training.
*'''Falls''' Each fall consists of a contraction and concurrent move from the feet or knees to the back. The falls are meant to demonstrate control of the body at each of the vertical levels previously practiced.&lt;ref name=Hart-Johnson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart-Johnson|first1=Diana|title=A Graham Technique Class|journal=Journal for the Anthropological Study of Human Movement|date=1997|volume=9|issue=4|pages=193–214|url=http://jashm.press.illinois.edu/9.4/9-4AGraham_Hart-Johnson193-214.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trademark dispute==
Martha Graham founded a school, the [[Martha Graham Center of Contemporary Dance]], which she sold in 1956. After Graham's death, [[Ron Protas]], her sole heir, sued the school for the rights to use Graham's trademarked name and choreography. A federal court awarded the school the rights to the names "Martha Graham" and "Graham technique" in 2001, and the rights to Graham's choreography in 2002.&lt;ref name=rights&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Martha Graham Center Wins Rights to the Dances|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/24/arts/martha-graham-center-wins-rights-to-the-dances.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York Times|date=24 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dunning|first1=Jennifer|title=Federal Judge Allows Martha Graham Center to Use Her Name and Methods|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/08/arts/dance/08GRAH.html|accessdate=13 March 2015|work=The New York TImes|date=8 August 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history of [[perpetual motion]] machines dates at least back to the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pomeroy |first1=Ross |title=Perpetual Motion Is Impossible... Right? |url=https://www.realclearscience.com/blog/2013/06/perpetual-motion.html |website=realclearscience.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For millennia, it was not clear whether perpetual motion devices were possible or not, but modern theories of [[thermodynamics]] have shown that they are impossible. Despite this, many attempts have been made to construct such machines, continuing into modern times. Modern designers and proponents sometimes use other terms, such as "overunity", to describe their inventions.

There are two types of perpetual motion machines:
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the first kind'' are those devices that violate the [[first law of thermodynamics]], the principle of conservation of energy, creating energy out of nothing. Most attempts fall into this category.
* ''Perpetual motion machines of the second kind'' are devices that violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. Even though they obey the principle of conservation of energy, they attempt extraction of work from a single heat reservoir, violating the principle of no [[entropy]] decrease in an isolated macroscopic thermodynamic system.

===Pre-19th century===
There are some unsourced claims&lt;ref&gt;Mark E. Eberhart(2007):''Feeding the fire: the lost history and uncertain future of mankind's energy'', p.14&lt;/ref&gt; that a perpetual motion machine called the "magic wheel" (a wheel spinning on its axle powered by lodestones) appeared in 8th-century [[Bavaria]]. This historical claim appears to be unsubstantiated though often repeated.

Early designs of perpetual motion machines were done by Indian [[Indian mathematics|mathematician]]–[[Indian astronomy|astronomer]] [[Bhāskara II|Bhaskara II]], who described a wheel ([[Bhāskara's wheel]]) that he claimed would run forever.&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"&gt;[[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.]] (April 1960). "Tibet, India, and Malaya as Sources of Western Medieval Technology", ''The American Historical Review'' '''65''' (3), p. 522-526.&lt;/ref&gt;

A drawing of a perpetual motion machine appeared in the sketchbook of [[Villard de Honnecourt]], a 13th-century  French master [[stonemason|mason]] and architect. The sketchbook was concerned with [[mechanics]] and [[architecture]]. Following the example of Villard, [[Peter of Maricourt]] designed a magnetic globe which, if it were mounted without friction parallel to the celestial axis, would rotate once a day. It was intended to serve as an automatic [[armillary sphere]].&lt;ref name="Lynn Townsend White 1960 p. 522-526"/&gt;

[[Leonardo da Vinci]] made a number of drawings of devices he hoped would make free [[energy]]. Leonardo da Vinci was generally against such devices, but drew and examined numerous overbalanced wheels.&lt;ref&gt;Time-Life Books (1991). ''Inventive Genius''. 143 pages. Page 125. {{ISBN|0-8094-7699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Mark Anthony Zimara, a 16th-century Italian scholar, proposed a self-blowing windmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=022yYXnS_GQC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;lpg=PA43&amp;dq=%22Directions+for+constructing+a+Perpetual+Motion+Machine+without+the+Use+of+Water+or+a+Weight%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0CRBPA8XUb&amp;sig=HG5hN7WSjTWvjywmNe5Qs4lIFtQ&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E-R7TfqZCqKD0QGHkKXrAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Directions%20for%20constructing%20a%20Perpetual%20Motion%20Machine%20without%20the%20Use%20of%20Water%20or%20a%20Weight%22&amp;f=false |title=Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession |first=Arthur W.

Various scholars in this period investigated the topic. In 1607 [[Cornelius Drebbel]] in "Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh" dedicated a Perpetuum motion machine to [[James I of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drebbel.net/Wondervondt.pdf |title=Wonder-vondt van de eeuwighe bewegingh |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described by Heinrich Hiesserle von Chodaw in 1621.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120310193332/http://www.drebbel.net/1621%20PPM.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Boyle]] devised the "perpetual vase" ("perpetual goblet" or "hydrostatic paradox") which was discussed by [[Denis Papin]] in the ''[[Philosophical Transactions]]'' for 1685.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/pascal.html "Inventor of the Week Archive: Pascal : Mechanical Calculator"], May 2003. "Pascal worked on many versions of the devices, leading to his attempt to create a perpetual motion machine. He has been credited with introducing the roulette machine, which was a by-product of these experiments."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johann Bernoulli]] proposed a fluid energy machine. In 1686, [[Georg Andreas Böckler]], designed a "self operating" self-powered [[water mill]] and several perpetual motion machines using balls using variants of [[Archimedes' screw]]s. In 1712, [[Johann Bessler]] ([[Orffyreus]]), claimed to have experimented with 300 different perpetual motion models before developing what he said were working models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Simaneck |first1=Donald E. |title=Perpetual Futility |url=https://www.lockhaven.edu/~dsimanek/museum/people/people.htm |website=lockhaven.edu |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1760s, [[James Cox (inventor)|James Cox]] and [[John Joseph Merlin]] developed [[Cox's timepiece]].&lt;ref&gt;Ord-Hume, Arthur W. J. G. Perpetual Motion: The History of an Obsession. St. Martin's Press. {{ISBN|0-312-60131-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Cox claimed that the timepiece was a true perpetual motion machine, but as the device is powered by changes in [[atmospheric pressure]] via a [[mercury barometer]], this is not the case.

In 1775, the [[French Academy of Sciences|Royal Academy of Sciences in Paris]] made the statement that the Academy "will no longer accept or deal with proposals concerning perpetual motion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Scaffer |first1=Simon |title=The Show That Never Ends: Perpetual Motion in the Early Eighteenth Century |journal=The British Journal for the History of Science |date=June 1995 |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=157 - 189 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/4027676?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial Revolution===

====19th century====
In 1812, [[Charles Redheffer]], in [[Philadelphia]], claimed to have developed a "generator" that could power other machines. The machine was open for viewing in Philadelphia, where Redheffer raised large amount of money from the admission fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/education/2003/nov/13/research.highereducation2|title=Too good to be true|last=Radford|first=Tim|date=2003-11-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Redheffer moved his machine to New York, after his cover was blown in Philadelphia, while applying for government funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Clifford B. (April 1961). "Why won't they work?". ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage Magazine]]''. American Heritage Publishing Company. Retrieved 28 August 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that [[Robert Fulton]] exposed Redheffer's schemes during an exposition of the device in New York City (1813). Removing some concealing wooden strips, Fulton found a [[catgut]] belt drive went through a wall to an attic. In the attic, a man was turning a crank to power the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/redheffer.html|title=This page has moved|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Information originally at www.skepticfiles.org/skep2/pmotion2.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi438.htm|title=No. 438: Redheffer's PMM-I|author=|date=|website=www.uh.edu|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827, [[Sir William Congreve, 2nd Baronet]] devised a machine running on [[capillary action]] that would disobey the principle that water seeks its own level, so to produce a continuous ascent and overflow. The device had an inclined plane over pulleys. At the top and bottom, there travelled an endless band of sponge, a bed and, over this, again an endless band of heavy weights jointed together. The whole stood over the surface of still water. Congreve believed his system would operate continuously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Perpetual Motion |url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/perpetual-motion-1911-11-18/ |website=scientificamerican.com |accessdate=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1868, an Austrian, Alois Drasch, received a US patent for a machine that possessed a "thrust key-type [[gear]]ing" of a [[rotary engine]]. The vehicle driver could tilt a trough depending upon need. A heavy ball rolled in a cylindrical trough downward, and, with continuous adjustment of the device's levers and power output, Drasch believed that it would be possible to power a vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hp-gramatke.de/pmm_physics/german/page0300.htm|title=HPs Perpetuum Mobile Physik.

In 1870, E.P. Willis of New Haven, Connecticut made money from a "proprietary" perpetual motion machine. A story of the overcomplicated device with a hidden source of energy appears in the ''[[Scientific American]]'' article "The Greatest Discovery Ever Yet Made". Investigation into the device eventually found a source of power that drove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealogyimagesofhistory.com/images/amotion.JPG|title=Image of Scientific American|author=|date=|website=genealogyimagesofhistory.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Ernst Worrell Keely]] claimed the invention of an induction resonance motion motor. He explained that he used "etheric technology". In 1872, Keely announced that he had discovered a principle for power production based on the vibrations of [[tuning fork]]s. Scientists investigated his machine which appeared to run on water, though Keely endeavoured to avoid this. Shortly after 1872, [[venture capitalist]]s accused Keely of fraud (they lost nearly five million dollars). Keely's machine, it was discovered after his death, was based on hidden air pressure tubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =  | first =  | author-link =  | last2 =  | first2 =  | author2-link =  | title = Keely's Secret Disclosed.; Scientists Examine His Laboratory and Discover Hidden Tubes in Proof of His Deception. | newspaper = [[New York Times]] | pages =  | year =  | date = 20 January 1899 | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1899/01/20/102408633.pdf | format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1900 to 1950====
In 1900, [[Nikola Tesla]] claimed to have discovered an abstract principle on which to base a perpetual motion machine of the [[Perpetual motion classification#Classification|second kind]]. No prototype was produced. He wrote:{{cquote|A departure from known methods – possibility of a "self-acting" engine or machine, inanimate, yet capable, like a living being, of deriving energy from the medium – the ideal way of obtaining motive power.&lt;ref name="Tesla 2018 p.

[[David Unaipon]], Australian inventor, had a lifelong fascination with perpetual motion. One of his studies on Newtonian mechanics led him to create a [[Sheep shearing|shearing]] machine in 1910 that converted curvilineal motion into straight line movement. The device is the basis of modern mechanical shears.&lt;ref&gt;Graham Jenkin, ''Conquest of the Ngarrindjeri'' (1979), pp. 234-236, {{ISBN|0-7270-1112-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910s and 1920s, Harry Perrigo of Kansas City, Missouri, a graduate of [[MIT]], claimed development of a free energy device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/list.cfm?list=sub&amp;SubjectareaID=77176 Harry E. Perrigo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008094240/http://www.kclibrary.org/localhistory/list.cfm?list=sub&amp;SubjectareaID=77176 |date=2007-10-08 }}, a vertical file at the [http://www.kclibrary.org/ Kansas City Public Library] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], described as follows: "Photos, illustrations, and information on Harry Perrigo, a local inventor of a "free energy" device in the 1910s-1920s turning out to be a hoax. Energy source of "invention" supposedly "from thin air" or from "ether waves" but in actually from a hidden battery."&lt;/ref&gt; Perrigo claimed the energy source was "from thin air" or from aether waves. He demonstrated the device before the Congress of the United States on December 15, 1917. Perrigo had a pending application&lt;ref&gt;filed December 31, 1925; Serial Number 78,719&lt;/ref&gt; for the "Improvement in Method and Apparatus for Accumulating and Transforming Ether Electric Energy". Investigators report that his device contained a hidden motor battery.&lt;ref&gt;Citations originally at www.kclibrary.org resources Subject area ID 77176&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Perpetual Motion by Norman Rockwell.jpg|thumb|222px|Cover of the October 1920 issue of ''Popular Science'' magazine]]
''[[Popular Science]]'', in the October 1920 issue, published an article on the lure of perpetual motion.&lt;ref&gt;Phillip Rowland.

===Modern era===

====1951 to 1980====
During the middle of the 20th century, [[Viktor Schauberger]] claimed to have discovered some special vortex energy in water. Since his death in 1958, people are still studying his works.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20010409231732/http://www.frank.germano.com/viktorschauberger.htm Who was Viktor Schauberger?] frank.germano.com. (archived version).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, [[Josef Papp]] (sometimes referred to as Joseph Papp or Joseph Papf) supposedly developed an alternative [[car engine]] that used [[noble gas|inert gases]]. He gained a few investors but when the engine was publicly demonstrated, an explosion killed one of the observers and injured two others. Papp blamed the accident on interference by  physicist [[Richard Feynman]], who later shared his observations in an article in ''Laser'', the journal of the Southern Californian Skeptics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/comments/papparticle2.html|title=Feynman on Papp|author=|date=|website=www.museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Papp continued to accept money but never demonstrated another engine.

On December 20 of 1977, Emil T. Hartman received {{US patent|4215330}} titled "Permanent magnet propulsion system". This device is related to the [[Simple Magnetic Overunity Toy]] (SMOT).

[[Guido Franch]] reportedly had a process of [[Alchemy|transmuting]] water molecules into high-[[octane]] [[gasoline]] compounds (named [[Mota fuel]]) that would reduce the price of gasoline to 8 cents per gallon. This process involved a green [[Powder (substance)|powder]] (this claim may be related to the similar ones of John Andrews (1917)). He was brought to court for [[fraud]] in 1954 and [[acquittal|acquitted]], but in 1973 was convicted. [[Judge|Justice]] William Bauer and Justice Philip Romiti both observed a demonstration in the 1954 case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_399.html|title=Is there a pill that can turn water into gasoline?|author=|date=14 December 1984|website=straightdope.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, [[Otis T. Carr]] from [[Oklahoma]] formed a company to manufacture [[unidentified flying object|UFO]]-styled [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s and [[hovercraft]]. Carr sold [[stock]] for this [[Commerce|commercial]] endeavour. He also promoted [[Second law of thermodynamics|free energy]] [[machine]]s. He claimed inspiration from [[Nikola Tesla]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keelynet.com/gravity/carr3.htm|title=Otis Carr Flying Machine - KeelyNet 12/23/01|author=|date=|website=www.keelynet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, physicist [[Richard Feynman]] discussed a [[Brownian ratchet]] that would supposedly extract meaningful work from [[Brownian motion]], although he went on to demonstrate how such a device would fail to work in practice.&lt;ref name="Feynman" &gt;{{cite book | last = Feynman | first = Richard P. | title = The Feynman Lectures on Physics, Vol. 1 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | year = 1963 | location = Massachusetts, USA | pages = Chapter 46 | isbn =0-201-02116-1 | nopp = true }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, David Hamel produced the Hamel generator, an "[[antigravity]]" device, supposedly after an [[alien abduction]]. The device was tested on ''[[MythBusters]]'' where it failed to demonstrate any lift-generating capability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kwc.org/mythbusters/2006/12/episode_68_christmas_tree_ligh.html|title=Annotated Mythbusters: Episode 68: Christmas Tree Lights, Antigravity Device, Vodka Myths IV|author=|date=|website=kwc.org|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[MythBusters]] Episode 68: Christmas Tree Lights, Antigravity Device, Vodka Myths IV {{cite web |url=http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-05.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109031748/http://dsc.discovery.com/fansites/mythbusters/episode/episode-tab-05.html |archivedate=2008-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USPatent4151431-2.png|thumb|222px|right|Howard R. Johnson's US Patent 4151431]]
[[Howard Robert Johnson]] developed a permanent magnet motor and, on April 24, 1979, received {{US patent|4151431}}.[The United States Patent office main classification of his 4151431 patent is as a "electrical generator or motor structure, dynamoelectric, linear" (310/12).] Johnson said that his device generates motion, either rotary or linear, from nothing but permanent magnets in rotor as well as stator, acting against each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Science &amp; Mechanics|author=Jorma Hyypia|title=Amazing Magnet-Powered Motor |date= Spring 1980|url=http://www.newebmasters.com/freeenergy/sm-pg45.html }} (Cover illustration is [http://www.rexresearch.com/johnson/1johnson.htm#scimech here].)&lt;/ref&gt; He estimated that permanent magnets made of proper hard materials should lose less than two percent of their magnetization in powering a device for 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=Sarasota Herald-Tribune |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=qsYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lmcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6671,6264163 |title=Industrial Engineer Gets Patent for a Device Powered by Magnets |date=April 29, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, [[Joseph Westley Newman]] applied for a patent on a [[direct current]] electrical motor which, according to his book ''[[The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman]]'' did more mechanical work than could be accounted for by the electrical power supplied to it.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Energy Machine of Joseph Newman | publisher=Joseph Newman Publishing Company | author=Newman, Joseph | year=1998 | location=Scottsdale, AZ, USA | isbn=0-9613835-8-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newman's patent application was rejected in 1983.&lt;ref name="USPTO_Newman"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1983000963 | title=Patent Application: "ENERGY GENERATION SYSTEM HAVING HIGHER ENERGY OUTPUT THAN INPUT" (failed) | publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office | date=17 March 1983 | accessdate=7 September 2016 | author=Newman, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="USPTO_MPEP_2107.01"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/pac/mpep/documents/2100_2107_01.htm | title=Manual of Patent Examining Procedure | publisher=United States Patent and Trademark Office | work=2107.01 General Principles Governing Utility Rejections (R-5) - 2100 Patentability.

The motionless electromagnetic generator (MEG) was built by Tom Bearden.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10957">The '''Human Security Report Project''' ('''HSRP''') is a [[peace and conflict studies]] research group. The Project is presently based at [[Simon Fraser University]]'s School for International Studies at [[Harbour Centre]] in [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada,&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=342&amp;Itemid=68 About the Project] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; having formerly been based at the [[University of British Columbia]]'s [[Liu Institute for Global Issues]] in the Human Security Centre.[[Image:HSRP Logo.png|thumb|Human Security Report Project (HSRP)]]

== Publications and services ==
The Project is known primarily for the ''[[Human Security Report 2005]]'', which provided evidence that, according to the Project's data and definitions, there had been a large decline in the number of [[war]]s, [[genocide]]s, and international crises since the end of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005:  [http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 The HSR In the News] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516033240/http://www.humansecurityreport.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=34&amp;Itemid=69 |date=2008-05-16 }} (accessed May 25, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Overview.pdf Overview] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Project adopts the 'narrow' conception of [[Human Security]]. The distinction between the 'narrow' and 'broad' concepts of Human Security, is summarized [[Human security#Freedom from Fear vs Freedom from Want and beyond|here]] on the Human Security page.&lt;/ref&gt; The reduction in armed conflict in recent history has been referred to as the [[Long Peace]],&lt;ref name="Gaddis1989"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gaddis|first=John Lewis|title=The Long Peace: Inquiries Into the History of the Cold War|year=1989|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-504335-9|url=https://www.amazon.com/Long-Peace-Inquiries-Into-History/dp/0195043359}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Freedman|first1=Lawrence|title=Stephen Pinker and the long peace: alliance, deterrence and decline|journal=Cold War History|volume=14|issue=4|year=2014|pages=657–672|issn=1468-2745|doi=10.1080/14682745.2014.950243}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there is general agreement among experts that the frequency of war has declined since at least the 1950s,&lt;ref name="Freedman2014"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HSC2013"/&gt; despite a widespread misperception that the world has become more dangerous.&lt;ref name="HSC2013"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Human Security Report 2013: The Decline in Global Violence| author = Human Security Research Group, [[Simon Fraser University]]| date = 2013| access-date = 11 November 2018| url = https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/HSRP_Report_2013_140226_Web.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fettweis2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fettweis|first1=Christopher J.|title=Unipolarity, Hegemony, and the New Peace|journal=Security Studies|volume=26|issue=3|year=2017|pages=423–451|issn=0963-6412|doi=10.1080/09636412.2017.1306394}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the Project published the ''Human Security Brief 2006'', updating the core global trend data from the 2005 ''Report'', and the ''Human Security Brief 2007''. The 2007 ''Brief'' demonstrated that there had been a sharp decline in the incidence of [[Terrorism|terrorist]] violence (measured in terms of numbers of fatalities) around the world. If fatalities from [[political violence]] against [[civilian]]s perpetrated by [[Non-state actor|non-state groups]] in [[Iraq]] are counted as deaths from terrorism, the decline dated mid-2007. This claim was disputed in a press release from the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]]'s [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] (START).&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf Chapter 1- Dying to Lose: Explaining the Decline in Global Terrorism] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120005915/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter1.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Maryland Newsdesk: [http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 Terrorism Fatalities Up, Not Down UMD Analysis Disputes New Report] (accessed March 22, 2009). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090621114431/http://www.newsdesk.umd.edu/sociss/release.cfm?ArticleID=1667 |date=June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, START at that time only had incident data to 2004. Subsequent START reports confirmed the large decline in fatalities from terrorism in 2007. One problem with the START project's dataset is that it counts politically motivated killings of civilians in [[civil war]] by non-state actors as terrorism in some contexts, but not in others.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} In Iraq, for example, such killings are counted as acts of terrorism, but the very large number of comparable killings in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]'s civil wars in the 1990s are not. Subsequent to the publication of the 2007 ''Brief'', the incidence of global terrorism has again increased, with most of the increase being in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Pakistan]]. Further, the 2007 ''Brief'' suggested positive change in Sub-Saharan Africa's security landscape; the number of conflicts being waged in the region more than halved between 1999 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Brief 2007: [http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf Chapter 2- Towards A New Peace in Africa?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120000129/http://www.humansecuritybrief.info/hsb07_chapter2.pdf |date=2008-11-20 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late October 2008, the Project published, in conjunction with the [[World Bank]], the ''miniAtlas of Human Security''.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security"&gt;[http://www.miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ miniAtlas of Human Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090311073705/http://miniatlasofhumansecurity.info/en/ |date=2009-03-11 }} (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; This publication was produced in three languages and is an "at-a-glance guide to global security issues", using a selection of maps and graphics to illustrate security trends, and is part of the World Bank's ''miniAtlas'' series.&lt;ref name="atlas of human security" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas World Bank miniAtlas Series] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717075252/http://publications.worldbank.org/ecommerce/catalog/simple-search?has_results_p=1&amp;search_type_to_pass=title&amp;search_text=miniAtlas |date=2011-07-17 }} (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; There have been subsequent translations of the ''miniAtlas'' into Russian, Japanese, and Arabic.

In 2010, the Project launched the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' at the [[United Nations]]. Part I of the ''Report'' examines "The Causes of Peace" since the end of [[World War II]]. Part II examines "The Shrinking Costs of War", paying particular attention to "indirect deaths" from war-exacerbated disease and [[malnutrition]]. Part III reviews recent trends in organized violence around the world. A hard copy version of the ''Report'' was published by [[Oxford University Press]] early in 2011. The text of the ''Report'' is freely available online at www.hsrgroup.org.

In addition to its publications, the Project runs several free e-services available in a number of delivery formats:

*[[Human Security Gateway]]
*[http://www.hsrgroup.org/our-work/overview.aspx Human Security Research]

== Funding and collaboration ==
The Project works closely with a number of the world's leading research groups in peace and conflict studies, including:&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report Project: [http://www.hsrgroup.org/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28&amp;Itemid=56 Partners] (accessed March 23, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

*The [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]], based in [[Norway]]
*The [[Uppsala Conflict Data Program]], based in [[Sweden]]

It has received funding from a number of governments, including:

*Canada's [[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]]
*The [[United Kingdom]]'s [[Department for International Development]]
*The [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]
*The [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]]
*The [[Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs]]

The Project is a principal partner of the [[International Relations and Security Network]].

== Criticism ==

Lack of robust conflict data remains a major problem with all attempts to track conflict numbers and fatality trends. The Uppsala Conflict Data Program's has an acknowledged tendency to undercount fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;Human Security Report 2005: [http://www.humansecurityreport.info/HSR2005_PDF/Part2.pdf Part II- The Human Security Audit] (accessed March 22, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; But the tendency to undercount does not obscure trends, and both researchers and policymakers who focus on the causes of war and peace are more concerned with trends––are the number of wars/battle deaths increasing or decreasing?––than in absolute numbers. For [[truth and reconciliation commission]]s, the reverse is true. There are various methodologies that can be used to estimate war deaths––incident-based reporting like that undertaken by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program, nationwide retrospective mortality surveys like those undertaken in Iraq and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], and censuses. Each has strengths and weaknesses. Uppsala's methodology is, however, the only one that permits timely annual updates for all conflict-affected countries. There are ongoing debates on the validity of data compiling and counting methodology. Part III of the ''Human Security Report 2009/2010'' contains a discussion of these debates.

It provides context to its metrics so that they are meaningful without knowledge of the specific dataset: for example, instead of letting the reader guess whether having five [[Fork (software development)|forks]] on [[GitHub]] is common, ImpactStory would tell that the repository is in the 95th percentile of all GitHub repositories created that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ImpactStory adds figshare integration|url=http://www.researchinformation.info/news/news_story.php?news_id=1443|work=Research Information|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The metrics provided by ImpactStory can be used by researchers who want to know how many times their work has been downloaded and shared,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Eisen|first=Jonathan|title=Playing with Impact Story to look at Alt Metrics for my papers, data, etc |url=http://phylogenomics.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/playing-with-impact-story-to-look-at.html|work=The Tree of Life|accessdate=1 January 2014|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also research funders who are interested in the impact of research beyond only considering citations to journal articles.

==Unpaywall==
Unpaywall is a [[browser extension]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Coldewey |first1=Devin |title=Unpaywall scours the web for free versions of scientific papers |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/05/unpaywall-scours-the-web-for-free-versions-of-scientific-papers/ |website=TechCrunch |accessdate=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; which find free versions of (paywalled) articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chawla |first1=Dalmeet Singh |title=Unpaywall finds free versions of paywalled papers |journal=Nature |date=4 April 2017 |doi=10.1038/nature.2017.21765}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018 it was reported to provide free access to 20 million articles,&lt;ref name="Else2018"/&gt; and about 47% of the articles that people search with Unpaywall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Doctorow |first1=Cory |title=Unpaywall: a search-engine for authorized, freely accessible versions of scholarly journal articles / Boing Boing |url=https://boingboing.net/2018/02/06/search-engine-arbitrage.html |website=boingboing.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2017 it was integrated into [[Web of Science]] and in July 2018 [[Elsevier]] announced plans the same month to integrate the service into the [[Scopus]] search engine.&lt;ref name="Else2018"/&gt;

The '''Kavli Institute for Theoretical Physics''' ('''KITP''') is a research institute of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]]. KITP is one of the most renowned institutes for [[theoretical physics]] in the world, and brings theorists in physics and related fields together to work on topics at the forefront of theoretical science. The [[National Science Foundation]] has been the principal supporter of the Institute since it was founded as the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1979. In a 2007 article in the ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', KITP was given the highest impact index in a comparison of nonbiomedical research organizations across the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/104/46/17943.full National scientific facilities and their impact on nonbiomedical research]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Directors of the KITP since its beginning have been:
* [[Walter Kohn]], 1979–1984 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Chemistry, 1998)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Robert Schrieffer]], 1984–1989 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize for Physics, 1972)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[James S. Langer]], 1989–1995
* [[James Hartle]], 1995–1997 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;([[Einstein Prize (APS)]], 2009)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[David Gross]], 1997–2012 &lt;span style="font-size:88%"&gt;(Nobel Prize in Physics, 2004)&lt;/span&gt;
* [[Lars Bildsten]], 2012–present

The Director and the permanent members of the KITP (Leon Balents, David Gross, Alexei Kitaev, Joseph Polchinski, and Boris Shraiman) are also on the faculty of the [[UC Santa Barbara Physics Department]].  Former permanent members include Physics Nobel Laureate [[Frank Wilczek]].

In the early 2000s, the institute, formerly known as the Institute for Theoretical Physics, or ITP, was named for the [[Norwegians|Norwegian]]-[[United States|American]] [[physicist]] and [[businessman]] [[Fred Kavli]], in recognition of his donation of $7.5 million to the Institute.

Kohn Hall, which houses KITP, is located just beyond the Henley Gate at the East Entrance of the UCSB campus.  The building was designed by the architect [[Michael Graves]], and a new wing designed by Graves was added in 2003-2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3027">The '''Keston Institute''' ('''Keston College''')&lt;ref name=kes/&gt; is an organisation dedicated to the [[religious studies|study of religion]] and [[communist countries]], at [[Oxford]], England. It was founded in 1969 by the Revd Canon Michael Bourdeaux.

==History==
In the 1950s, Michael Bourdeaux spent a year in [[Moscow]] as a part of the first wave of British exchange students; he soon found only 41 [[Russian Orthodox Church]]es to still be functioning out of the 1,600 before the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] in 1917. This prompted him to take up the cause of those persecuted for their religious faith.&lt;ref name=rus/&gt; 

In 1969 Bourdeaux founded at [[Chislehurst]] the Centre for the Study of Religion and Communism&lt;ref name=rus&gt;''The Future of Freedom in Russia'', by William J. Vanden Heuvel. Published by Templeton Foundation Press, 2000. {{ISBN|1-890151-43-2}}. p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; together with Sir John Lawrence, and with the help of [[Leonard Schapiro]] and Peter Reddaway, Professor of Political Science and International Affairs at [[George Washington University]]. In the early 1970s he bought the old parish school on [[Keston]] Common and the centre was renamed [[Keston College]]. Later it broadened its purview to include former communist countries with its main concerns being the former [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Eastern Bloc]].&lt;ref name=kes&gt;[http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml About us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107044403/http://www.keston.org.uk/information.shtml |date=2009-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years it played a key role in the revival of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]],&lt;ref&gt;''Russian Orthodoxy Resurgent: Faith and Power in the New Russia'', by John Garrard, Carol Garrard. Published by Princeton University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|0-691-12573-2}}. ''Page xv''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has become a leading voice on [[religious freedom]] in former communist countries, with an emphasis on the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ox.ac.uk/gazette/2000-1/weekly/210900/ads.htm  the Keston Institute is an Oxford- based research charity which is...] ''[[Oxford University]] Gazette.'', 2000-1.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the enterprise was relocated to Oxford.

In 1984 [[Michael Bourdeaux]] won the [[Templeton Prize]]. The current chairman at the Keston Institute is [[Xenia Dennen]].

Since 2007, the Keston Institute's archive and library have been under the care of the Keston Center for Religion, Politics, &amp; Society at [[Baylor University]], [[Waco, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baylor.edu/kestoncenter/ Keston Center]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Kiosko''''' was an unsold [[television pilot]] for a multicultural music education television series for children produced by [[KPBS (TV)|KPBS]] television in [[San Diego, California]].  It was nominated in 2008 for an Emmy award under the Children's Program or Special Category, Pacific Southwest Chapter of the National Television Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nataspsw.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/Emmy-2008-Nominees.pdf Emmy 2008 Nominations]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's focus was on music education, using various forms of music from around the globe.  It featured a combination of live action, puppetry, and animation, similar to ''[[Sesame Street]]''.

The pilot for the show was aired in August 2007, but the show was never picked up.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7474">[[Image:Les Très Riches Heures du duc de Berry aout.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Illustration from [[Très riches heures du Duc de Berry]], 1412-16, by Pol and Hermann de Limbourg, representing the month of August and depicting, in the foreground, the Nobility riding out to hunt with falcons while in the midground, the harvest takes place and the workers cool off in the river. One of the Duc's many castles, Étampes, completes the scene. Illumination on vellum, 22,5 x 13,6 cm]]
The term '''Labours of the Months''' refers to cycles in [[Medieval art|Medieval]] and early [[Renaissance art]] depicting in twelve scenes the rural activities that commonly took place in the months of the year.  They are often linked to the signs of the [[Zodiac]], and are seen as humankind's response to God's ordering of the Universe. 

The Labours of the Months are frequently found as part of large sculptural schemes on churches, and in [[illuminated manuscripts]], especially in the Calendars of late medieval [[Book of Hours|Books of Hours]].  The manuscripts are important for the development of [[landscape painting]], containing most of the first painting where this was given prominence. The most famous cycle is that painted in the early 15th century by [[Limbourg Brothers|Hermann, Pol and Johan de Limbourg]] in [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]]. In the 16th century, late in the history of the theme, [[Simon Bening]] produced especially fine cycles which link the Limbourgs with the landscape paintings of [[Peter Breughel the Elder]].

==Typical cycle==
The contents of cycles varied with date, location, and the purpose of the work. The [[Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry]] &lt;small&gt;(illustrated right)&lt;/small&gt; was designed for the personal use of a great magnate, and was unusually large, allowing all the typical elements to be used in many months. It combines astrological and calendar information at the top, with a combination of the agricultural life of the peasant, the life of the elite courtiers, and illustrations of the Duke's many castles in the background of several scenes.   

A typical simple scheme was:&lt;ref&gt;Calkins, Robert G. ''Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages'', mp 246, Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

*January - Feasting
*February - Sitting by the fire
*March - Pruning trees, or digging
*April - Planting, enjoying the country or picking flowers
*May - Hawking, courtly love
*June - Hay harvest
*July - Wheat harvest
*August - Wheat threshing
*September - Grape harvest
*October - Ploughing or sowing
*November - Gathering acorns for pigs
*December - Killing pigs, baking

- but there were many variations, especially in major wine-growing areas, where more wine related scenes were included.  Italian cycles often advance the agricultural scenes a month earlier than ones from the [[Low countries]] or England.  The impact of the onset of the [[Little Ice Age]] has been detected in differences between early and late examples.

==Sculpture cycles==
[[Image:Perugia - Fontana Maggiore - 1 - Mesi - 09 - Settembre - Foto G. Dall'Orto 5 ago 2006.jpg|thumb|250px|The Month of September from the Fontana Maggiore in [[Perugia]] (c. 1275), by Nicola and Giovanni Pisano, shows the treading of grapes.]] 
Most sculptured cycles in Europe, especially when compressed into the [[archivolt]] of a portal, consist of an astrological symbol beside, above or incorporated in a sculpture or relief illustrating a monthly labour.

A few sculpted examples of the many surviving are: 
* [[Chartres cathedral]]: west and north portal archivolts. Window, see below
* [[Notre Dame, Paris]]: northern doorjambs of the west facade (Portal of the Virgin), and a stained glass Zodiacs, labours, vices and virtues cycle filling the west rose window
* [[Abbey of la Madaleine, Vézelay|Vezelay Abbey]]: Archivolt of main west basilica doorway
* [[Autun Cathedral]]: Archivolt of main west cathedral doorway
* [[Ferrara Cathedral]]
* [[Saint Mark's, Venice]]: main portal
* [[San Zeno di Verona]]: facade
* [[Lucca Cathedral]]:  large bas-relief panels with little Zodial signs, to the right and left of the main facade door
* [[Fontana Maggiore]], [[Perugia]]: relief panels showing monthly labours are amongst those surrounding the lower basin of the great  fountain in front of the Duomo.
* [[Otranto Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and labours form part of the mosaic scenes which cover the entire floor.
* [[Canterbury Cathedral]]: Zodiac signs and monthly labours are amongst the subjects illustrated in large inlaid marble floor medallions on the edge of the Trinity Chapel close to where the shrine of Saint Thomas (Becket) was located.
* [[St Augustine's Church, Brookland]], Kent: large cylindrical lead font with reliefs of both Zodiac signs and monthly labours - a rare example in the UK both of such a font and of the combination of zodiac signs and monthly labours.
* [[Carlisle Cathedral]]: the foliate capitals of the twelve piers of the choir each contain a figure representing one of the labours of the months.

==Stained glass==
[[Image:Chartres_cathedral_041_Seasons_Dec_Jan_Feb.JPG|thumb|250px|Chartres Cathedral, the months of December, January and February]]
The Labours of the months often occur in those [[rose window]]s that are dedicated to the [[Genesis creation myth|Creation]], the circular nature of the window suiting the cyclic theme. In these windows, the months are part of a complex iconographical scheme. Other windows have the Labours of the Months specifically as their subject matter.

== [http://www.printedweb.org ''Printed Web''] (publication) ==
''Printed Web'' is an artists' publication devoted to web-to-print art and discourse, published by Paul Soulellis / Library of the Printed Web. The project began in 2014 as a way to present new work by artists included in Soulellis’ Library of the Printed Web. Artists are invited to submit new or existing network-based work for the printed page. In the spirit of Seth Siegelaub, each issue is curated as a group exhibition for the printed page. Printed Web circulates primarily as print-on-demand publications, but also includes PDFs, ZIPs, GIFs, and server directories. More than 180 artists and writers have contributed to the project through issue #4. Individual issues are widely held in special artists’ publications collections and libraries, including Museum of Modern Art NY, Yale University, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Walker Center, and NY Public Library.

''Printed Web 2'' was included in the exhibition "Aerial Imagery in Print, 1860 to Today" at [[Museum of Modern Art]], organized by MoMA Library, featuring a project by [[James Bridle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://moma.org/calendar/exhibitions/1663?locale=en|title=Aerial Imagery in Print, 1860 to Today {{!}} MoMA|website=The Museum of Modern Art|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Printed Web 3'' was an open call and launched on the front page of [[Rhizome]] and at Offprint London in May 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhizome.org/editorial/2015/may/18/printed-web-3/|title=Poor Media on Demand: All the files of Printed Web 3|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring work by 147 artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.rhizome.org/Printed_Web_3/|title=Index of /Printed_Web_3|publisher=|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Printed Web 4'' was a co-publication with [[International Center of Photography]] and featured in the exhibition "Public, Private, Secret," curated by [[Charlotte Cotton]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.publicprivatesecret.org/|title=Public, Private, Secret|website=Public, Private, Secret|access-date=2016-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text "Folding the Web" by Michael Connor, artistic director of [[Rhizome (organization)|Rhizome]], was included in ''Printed Web 4''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rhizome.org/editorial/2016/jun/16/folding-the-web/|title=Folding the Web|access-date=2016-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Two Giraffes.PNG|thumb|[[Giraffes]] in [[Kenya]]; giraffes have been called "especially [[homosexual behavior in animals|gay]]" for often engaging in male-male sexual behavior more than male-female ([[heterosexual]]) [[sex]].&lt;ref name="You Are Being Lied to: The"&gt;Kick (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Imaginova (2007f)&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For these mammals, there is documented evidence of [[homosexual behavior in animals|homosexual behavior]] of one or more of the following kinds: [[Animal sexual behavior|sexual behavior]], [[courtship]], [[affection]], [[pair bond]]ing, or [[parenting]].

[[Bruce Bagemihl]] writes that the presence of [[same-sex sexual behavior]] was not officially observed on a large scale until the 1990s due to possible [[Observer-expectancy effect|observer bias]] caused by social attitudes towards [[LGBT]] people making homosexuality in animals a [[taboo]] subject.&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"&gt;Bagemihl (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"&gt;News-medical.net (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; He devotes three chapters; ''Two Hundred Years at Looking at Homosexual Wildlife'', ''Explaining (Away) Animal Homosexuality,'' and ''Not For Breeding Only'' in his 1999 book ''Biological Exuberance'' to the "documentation of systematic [[prejudice]]s" where he notes "the ''present ignorance'' of [[biology]] lies precisely in its single-minded attempt to find reproductive (or other) "explanations" for homosexuality, transgender, and [[procreate|non-procreative]] and alternative [[heterosexual]]ities.&lt;ref name="Not For Breeding Only"&gt;Bagemihl (1999) page 213&lt;/ref&gt; Petter Bøckman, academic adviser for the ''[[Against Nature?]]'' exhibit stated "[M]any researchers have described homosexuality as something altogether different from sex. They must realise that animals can have sex with who they will, when they will and without consideration to a researcher's [[Ethics (philosophy)|ethical]] [[principle]]s". Homosexual behavior is  found amongst social [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s, particularly the sea mammals and the [[primates]].&lt;ref name="1,500 Animal Species Practice"/&gt;

Animal sexual behavior takes many different forms, even within the same [[species]] and the motivations for and implications of their behaviors have yet to be fully understood. Bagemihl's research shows that homosexual behavior, not necessarily sexual activity, has been documented in about 500 species as of 1999, ranging from [[primates]] to [[Acanthocephala|gut worms]].&lt;ref name="Two Hundred Years"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Biological Exuberance: Animal"&gt;Harrold (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality in animals is controversial with some [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] because it asserts the naturalness of homosexuality in humans, while others counter that it has no implications and is nonsensical to equate animal behavior to [[morality]].&lt;ref name="The Animal Homosexuality Myth"&gt;Solimeo (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Defending A Higher Law"&gt;Solimeo (2004b)&lt;/ref&gt;  On the other hand, social liberals and many gay people believe homosexuality is natural, and therefore find the existence of homosexual sex in animals unsurprising.  Animal preference and motivation is always inferred from behavior. Thus homosexual behavior has been given a number of terms over the years. The correct usage of the term ''homosexual'' is that an animal ''exhibits homosexual behavior'', however this article conforms to the usage by modern research&lt;ref&gt;Bagemihl (1999) pages 122-166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roughgarden (2004) pp.13-183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vasey (1995) pages 173-204&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sommer &amp; Vasey (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; applying the term ''homosexuality'' to all sexual behavior ([[Copulation (zoology)|copulation]], [[genitals|genital]] stimulation, [[mating|mating games]] and sexual [[Display (zoology)|display behavior]]) between animals of the same sex.

This a list of some [[mammals]] that had been recorded engaging in homosexual behavior, which is part of a larger [[list of animals displaying homosexual behavior]] including [[birds]], [[insects]], [[fish]] etc.

'''Mathematics and art''' are related in a variety of ways. [[Mathematics]] has itself been described as an [[art]] [[mathematical beauty|motivated by beauty]]. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as [[Music and mathematics|music]], [[dance]], [[painting]], [[Mathematics and architecture|architecture]], [[sculpture]], and [[Mathematics and fiber arts|textiles]]. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.

Mathematics and art have a long historical relationship. [[List of mathematical artists|Artists have used mathematics]] since the 4th century BC when the Greek [[sculpture|sculptor]] [[Polykleitos]] wrote his ''Canon'', prescribing proportions based on the ratio 1:{{radic|2}} for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the [[golden ratio]] in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian [[Renaissance]], [[Luca Pacioli]] wrote the influential treatise ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'' (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, [[Piero della Francesca]], developed [[Euclid]]'s ideas on [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in treatises such as ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', and in his paintings. The engraver [[Albrecht Dürer]] made many references to mathematics in his work ''[[Melencolia I]]''. In modern times, the [[graphic artist]] [[M. C. Escher]] made intensive use of [[tessellation]] and [[hyperbolic geometry]], with the help of the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]], while the [[De Stijl]] movement led by [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as [[quilting]], [[knitting]], [[cross-stitch]], [[crochet]], [[embroidery]], [[weaving]], [[Turkish carpet|Turkish]] and other [[carpet]]-making, as well as [[kilim]]. In [[Islamic art]], symmetries are evident in forms as varied as Persian [[girih]] and Moroccan [[zellige]] tilework, [[Mughal architecture|Mughal]] [[jali]] pierced stone screens, and widespread [[muqarnas]] vaulting.

Mathematics has directly influenced art with conceptual tools such as [[linear perspective]], the analysis of [[symmetry]], and mathematical objects such as [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] and the [[Möbius strip]]. [[Magnus Wenninger]] creates colourful [[stellation|stellated polyhedra]], originally as models for teaching. Mathematical concepts such as [[recursion]] and logical paradox can be seen in paintings by [[Rene Magritte]] and in engravings by M. C. Escher. [[Computer art]] often makes use of [[fractal]]s including the [[Mandelbrot set]], and sometimes explores other mathematical objects such as [[cellular automata]]. Controversially, the artist [[David Hockney]] has argued that artists from the Renaissance onwards made use of the [[camera lucida]] to draw precise representations of scenes; the architect Philip Steadman similarly argued that [[Vermeer]] used the [[camera obscura]] in his distinctively observed paintings.

Other relationships include the algorithmic analysis of artworks by [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], the finding that traditional [[batik]]s from different regions of [[Java]] have distinct [[fractal dimension]]s, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially [[Filippo Brunelleschi]]'s theory of perspective, which eventually led to [[Girard Desargues]]'s [[projective geometry]]. A persistent view, based ultimately on the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's [[sacred geometry|geometry is sacred]], as seen in artworks such as [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Ancient of Days]]''.

==Origins: from Ancient Greece to the Renaissance==

{{Anchor|Polykleitos}}

===Polykleitos's ''Canon'' and ''symmetria''===
[[File:Doryphoros MAN Napoli Inv6011-2.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Roman copy in marble of ''[[Doryphoros]]'', originally a bronze by [[Polykleitos]]]]
{{further information|Polykleitos}}

[[Polykleitos]] the elder (c.450–420 BC) was a [[Greeks|Greek]] [[sculptor]] from the school of [[Argos]], and a contemporary of [[Phidias]]. His works and statues consisted mainly of bronze and were of athletes. According to the philosopher and mathematician [[Xenocrates]], Polykleitos is ranked as one of the most important sculptors of [[Classical antiquity]] for his work on the ''[[Doryphorus]]'' and the statue of [[Hera]] in the [[Heraion of Argos]].&lt;ref name=Stewart&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stewart |first1=Andrew |title=Polykleitos of Argos," One Hundred Greek Sculptors: Their Careers and Extant Works |journal=[[Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |date=November 1978 |volume=98 |pages=122–131 |doi=10.2307/630196|jstor=630196}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his sculptures may not be as famous as those of Phidias, they are much admired. In the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos, a treatise he wrote designed to document the "perfect" [[anatomy|anatomical]] proportions of the male nude, Polykleitos gives us a mathematical approach towards sculpturing the human body.&lt;ref name=Stewart/&gt;

Polykleitos uses the [[distal phalanges|distal phalanx]] of the [[little finger]] as the basic module for determining the proportions of the human body.&lt;ref name=Tobin&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tobin, Richard |title=The ''Canon'' of Polykleitos |journal=[[American Journal of Archaeology]] |volume=79 |issue=4 |date=October 1975 |pages=307–321 |doi=10.2307/503064}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polykleitos multiplies the length of the distal phalanx by the [[square root of two]] ({{radic|2}}) to get the distance of the [[intermediate phalanges|second phalanges]] and multiplies the length again by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the [[proximal phalanges|third phalanges]]. Next, he takes the [[finger]] length and multiplies that by {{radic|2}} to get the length of the palm from the base of the finger to the [[ulna]]. This [[geometric series]] of measurements progresses until Polykleitos has formed the arm, chest, body, and so on.&lt;ref name=Lawton&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lawton |first1=Arthur J. |title=Pattern, Tradition and Innovation in Vernacular Architecture |journal=Past |date=2013 |volume=36 |url=http://www.pioneeramerica.org/past2013/past2013artlawton.html |quote=The base figure is a square the length and width of the distal phalange of the little finger. Its diagonals rotated to one side transform the square to a 1 : {{radic|2}} root rectangle. In Figure 5 this rectangular figure marks the width and length of the adjacent medial phalange. Rotating the medial diagonal proportions the proximal phalange and similarly from there to the wrist, from wrist to elbow and from elbow to shoulder top. Each new step advances the diagonal's pivot point.|accessdate=25 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos is immense in [[Classical Greek]], [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], and [[Renaissance]] sculpture, many sculptors following Polykleitos's prescription. While none of Polykleitos's original works survive, Roman copies demonstrate his ideal of physical perfection and mathematical precision. Some scholars argue that [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] thought influenced the ''Canon'' of Polykleitos.&lt;ref name=Raven&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raven |first1=J. E. |title=Polyclitus and Pythagoreanism |journal=[[Classical Quarterly]] |date=1951 |volume=1|issue=3–4 |pages=147– |doi=10.1017/s0009838800004122}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Canon'' applies the basic mathematical concepts of Greek geometry, such as the ratio, proportion, and ''symmetria'' (Greek for "harmonious proportions") and turns it into a system capable of describing the human form through a series of continuous [[geometric series|geometric progressions]].&lt;ref name=Tobin/&gt;

===Perspective and proportion===
{{main article|Perspective (graphical)}}

[[File:Brunelleschi's perspective experiment.jpg|thumb|[[Filippo Brunelleschi|Brunelleschi]]'s experiment with [[linear perspective]]]]

In classical times, rather than making distant figures smaller with [[linear perspective]], painters sized objects and figures according to their thematic importance. In the Middle Ages, some artists used [[reverse perspective]] for special emphasis. The Muslim mathematician [[Alhazen]] (Ibn al-Haytham) described a theory of optics in his ''[[Book of Optics]]'' in 1021, but never applied it to art.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt; The [[Renaissance]] saw a rebirth of [[Classical Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] culture and ideas, among them the study of mathematics to understand [[nature]] and the [[arts]]. Two major motives drove artists in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance towards mathematics. First, painters needed to figure out how to depict three-dimensional scenes on a two-dimensional canvas. Second, philosophers and artists alike were convinced that mathematics was the true essence of the physical world and that the entire universe, including the arts, could be explained in geometric terms.&lt;ref name=Emmer&gt;{{cite book |editor=Emmer, Michelle |title=The Visual Mind II |publisher=MIT Press |date=2005 |isbn=978-0-262-05048-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rudiments of perspective arrived with [[Giotto di Bondone|Giotto]] (1266/7 – 1337), who attempted to draw in perspective using an algebraic method to determine the placement of distant lines. In 1415, the Italian [[architect]] [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and his friend [[Leon Battista Alberti]] demonstrated the geometrical method of applying perspective in Florence, using [[similar triangles]] as formulated by Euclid, to find the apparent height of distant objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vasari, Giorgio |authorlink=Giorgio Vasari |date=1550 |title=[[Lives of the Artists]] |publisher=Torrentino |page=Chapter on Brunelleschi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Alberti |first1=Leon Battista |last2=Spencer |first2=John R. |title=On Painting |date=1956 |publisher=Yale University Press |origyear=1435|url=http://www.noteaccess.com/Texts/Alberti/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brunelleschi's own perspective paintings are lost, but [[Masaccio]]'s painting of the Holy Trinity shows his principles at work.&lt;ref name=StAndrews/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Field |first1=J. V. |title=The Invention of Infinity: Mathematics and Art in the Renaissance |date=1997 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-852394-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Witcombe |first1=Christopher L.

The Italian painter [[Paolo Uccello]] (1397–1475) was fascinated by perspective, as shown in his paintings of ''[[The Battle of San Romano]]'' (c. 1435–1460): broken lances lie conveniently along perspective lines.&lt;ref name="Hart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/art.html |title=Polyhedra in Art |author=Hart, George W. |authorlink=George W. Hart |accessdate=24 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CunninghamReich2014"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cunningham |first1=Lawrence |last2=Reich |first2=John |last3=Fichner-Rathus |first3=Lois |title=Culture and Values: A Survey of the Western Humanities |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t0bCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA375 |date=1 January 2014 |publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=978-1-285-44932-6 |page=375 |quote=which illustrate Uccello's fascination with perspective.

The painter [[Piero della Francesca]] (c.1415–1492) exemplified this new shift in Italian Renaissance thinking. He was an expert [[mathematician]] and [[geometer]], writing books on [[solid geometry]] and [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], including ''[[De Prospectiva Pingendi]] (On Perspective for Painting)'', ''Trattato d'Abaco (Abacus Treatise)'', and ''De corporibus regularibus (On Regular Solids)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=della Francesca, Piero |title=De Prospectiva Pingendi |editor=G.

[[Linear perspective]] was just being introduced into the artistic world. Alberti explained in his 1435 ''[[De pictura]]'': "light rays travel in straight lines from points in the observed scene to the eye, forming a kind of [[pyramid]] with the eye as vertex." A painting constructed with linear perspective is a [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-section]] of that pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Alberti, Leon Battista |title=On Painting |editor= Kemp, Martin |author2=Grayson, Cecil (trans.) |publisher=Penguin Classics |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''De Prospectiva Pingendi'', Piero transforms his empirical observations of the way aspects of a figure change with point of view into mathematical proofs. His treatise starts in the vein of Euclid: he defines the point as "the tiniest thing that is possible for the eye to comprehend".{{efn|In Piero's Italian: "una cosa tanto picholina quanto e possible ad ochio comprendere".}}&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; He uses [[deductive logic]] to lead the reader to the perspective representation of a three-dimensional body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Peterson, Mark |url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/courses/rschwart/mac/Italian/geometry.shtml |title=The Geometry of Piero della Francesca |quote=In Book I, after some elementary constructions to introduce the idea of the apparent size of an object being actually its angle subtended at the eye, and referring to Euclid's Elements Books I and VI, and Euclid's Optics, he turns, in Proposition 13, to the representation of a square lying flat on the ground in front of the viewer. What should the artist actually draw? After this, objects are constructed in the square (tilings, for example, to represent a tiled floor), and corresponding objects are constructed in perspective; in Book II prisms are erected over these planar objects, to represent houses, columns, etc.; but the basis of the method is the original square, from which everything else follows.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[David Hockney]] [[Hockney-Falco thesis|argued]] in his book ''[[Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters]]'' that artists started using a [[camera lucida]] from the 1420s, resulting in a sudden change in precision and realism, and that this practice was continued by major artists including [[Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], [[Jan van Eyck|Van Eyck]], and [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockney |first=David |title=Secret Knowledge: Rediscovering the Lost Techniques of the Old Masters |year=2006 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-28638-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics disagree on whether Hockney was correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Van Riper |first1=Frank |title=Hockney's 'Lucid' Bomb At the Art Establishment |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/photo/essays/vanRiper/030220.htm |publisher=The Washington Post |accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Marr |first1=Andrew |title=What the eye didn't see |url=https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2001/oct/07/featuresreview.review1 |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=7 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the architect Philip Steadman argued controversially&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Janson |first1=Jonathan |title=An Interview with Philip Steadman |url=http://www.essentialvermeer.com/interviews_newsletter/steadman_interview.html#.VeqxKJdUWHg |publisher=Essential Vermeer |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=25 April 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Vermeer]] had used a different device, the [[camera obscura]], to help him create his distinctively observed paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Steadman |first1=Philip |title=Vermeer's Camera: Uncovering the Truth Behind the Masterpieces |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-280302-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1509, [[Luca Pacioli]] (c. 1447–1517) published ''[[De divina proportione]]'' on [[mathematical]] and [[artistic]] [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportion]], including in the human face. [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452–1519) illustrated the text with woodcuts of regular solids while he studied under Pacioli in the 1490s. Leonardo's drawings are probably the first illustrations of skeletonic solids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/pacioli.html |title=Luca Pacioli's Polyhedra |author=Hart, George |authorlink=George W.

As early as the 15th century, [[curvilinear perspective]] found its way into paintings by artists interested in image distortions. [[Jan van Eyck]]'s 1434 ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'' contains a convex mirror with reflections of the people in the scene,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Criminisi, A. |author2=Kempz, M. |author3=Kang, S.

Three-dimensional space can be represented convincingly in art, as in [[technical drawing]], by means other than perspective. [[Oblique projection]]s, including cavalier perspective (used by French military artists to depict fortifications in the 18th century), were used continuously and ubiquitously by Chinese artists from the first or second centuries until the 18th century. The Chinese acquired the technique from India, which acquired it from Ancient Rome. Oblique projection is seen in Japanese art, such as in the [[Ukiyo-e]] paintings of [[Torii Kiyonaga]] (1752–1815).&lt;ref name=Cucker269&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=269–278}}&lt;/ref&gt;

an irrational number which is approximately 1.325.

===Planar symmetries===

[[Planar symmetry|Planar symmetries]] have for millennia been exploited in artworks such as [[carpet]]s, lattices, textiles and tilings.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ellison/&gt;&lt;ref name=Castera/&gt;

Many traditional rugs, whether pile carpets or flatweave [[kilim]]s, are divided into a central field and a framing border; both can have symmetries, though in handwoven carpets these are often slightly broken by small details, variations of pattern and shifts in colour introduced by the weaver.&lt;ref name=Cucker89&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=89–102}}&lt;/ref&gt; In kilims from [[Anatolia]], the [[motif (textile arts)|motifs]] used are themselves usually symmetrical. The general layout, too, is usually present, with arrangements such as stripes, stripes alternating with rows of motifs, and packed arrays of roughly hexagonal motifs. The field is commonly laid out as a wallpaper with a [[wallpaper group]] such as pmm, while the border may be laid out as a frieze of [[frieze group]] pm11, pmm2 or pma2. Turkish and Central Asian kilims often have three or more borders in different frieze groups. Weavers certainly had the intention of symmetry, without explicit knowledge of its mathematics.&lt;ref name=Cucker89/&gt;
The mathematician and architectural theorist [[Nikos Salingaros]] suggests that the "powerful presence"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; (aesthetic effect) of a "great carpet"&lt;ref name=Salingaros/&gt; such as the best Konya two-medallion carpets of the 17th century is created by mathematical techniques related to the theories of the architect [[Christopher Alexander]]. These techniques include making opposites couple; opposing colour values; differentiating areas geometrically, whether by using complementary shapes or balancing the directionality of sharp angles; providing small-scale complexity (from the knot level upwards) and both small- and large-scale symmetry; repeating elements at a hierarchy of different scales (with a ratio of about 2.7 from each level to the next). Salingaros argues that "all successful carpets satisfy at least nine of the above ten rules", and suggests that it might be possible to create a metric from these rules.&lt;ref name=Salingaros&gt;{{cite journal |author=Salingaros, Nikos |title=The 'life' of a carpet: an application of the Alexander rules |url=http://zeta.math.utsa.edu/~yxk833/life.carpet.html |journal=8th International Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Philadelphia |date=November 1996}} Reprinted in {{cite book |editor1-last=Eiland |editor1-first=M. |editor2-last=Pinner |editor2-first=M. |title=Oriental Carpet and Textile Studies V |date=1998 |publisher=Conference on Oriental Carpets |location=Danville, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Islamic art]] [[Islamic geometric patterns|exploits symmetries]] in many of its artforms, notably in [[girih tiles|girih]] tilings. These are formed using a set of five tile shapes, namely a regular decagon, an elongated hexagon, a bow tie, a rhombus, and a regular pentagon. All the sides of these tiles have the same length; and all their angles are multiples of 36° (π/5 [[radian]]s), offering fivefold and tenfold symmetries. The tiles are decorated with [[strapwork]] lines (girih), generally more visible than the tile boundaries. In 2007, the physicists [[Peter Lu]] and [[Paul Steinhardt]]  argued that girih resembled [[quasicrystalline]] [[Penrose tiling]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Lu, Peter J. |author2=Steinhardt, Paul J. |year=2007 |title=Decagonal and Quasi-crystalline Tilings in Medieval Islamic Architecture |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=315 |pages=1106–1110 |doi=10.1126/science.1135491 |pmid=17322056 |issue=5815 |bibcode=2007Sci...315.1106L}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elaborate geometric [[zellige]] tilework is a distinctive element in [[Morocco|Moroccan]] architecture.&lt;ref name=Castera&gt;{{cite book |last1=Castera |first1=Jean Marc |last2=Peuriot |first2=Francoise |title=Arabesques.

===Polyhedra===
[[File:Leonardo polyhedra.png|thumb|The first printed illustration of a [[rhombicuboctahedron]], by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], published in ''[[De Divina Proportione]]'', 1509]]

The [[Platonic solid]]s and other [[polyhedron|polyhedra]] are a recurring theme in Western art. They are found, for instance, in a marble mosaic featuring the [[small stellated dodecahedron]], attributed to Paolo Uccello, in the floor of the [[San Marco di Venezia|San Marco Basilica]] in Venice;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in Leonardo da Vinci's diagrams of regular polyhedra drawn as illustrations for [[Luca Pacioli]]'s 1509 book ''The Divine Proportion'';&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; as a glass [[rhombicuboctahedron]] in Jacopo de Barbari's portrait of Pacioli, painted in 1495;&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; in the truncated polyhedron (and various other mathematical objects) in [[Albrecht Dürer]]'s engraving [[Melencolia I]];&lt;ref name="Hart"/&gt; and in [[Salvador Dalí]]'s painting ''The Last Supper'' in which Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].

[[Albrecht Dürer]] (1471–1528) was a [[German people|German]] [[Renaissance]] [[printmaker]] who made important contributions to polyhedral literature in his 1525 book, ''Underweysung der Messung (Education on Measurement)'', meant to teach the subjects of [[linear perspective]], [[geometry]] in [[architecture]], [[Platonic solids]], and [[regular polygons]]. Dürer was likely influenced by the works of [[Luca Pacioli]] and [[Piero della Francesca]] during his trips to [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panofsky, E. |title=The Life and Art of Albrecht Durer |publisher=Princeton |year=1955}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the examples of perspective in ''Underweysung der Messung'' are underdeveloped and contain inaccuracies, there is a detailed discussion of polyhedra. Dürer is also the first to introduce in text the idea of [[Net (polyhedron)|polyhedral nets]], polyhedra unfolded to lie flat for printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hart, George W. |url=http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/durer.html |title=Dürer's Polyhedra |accessdate=13 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dürer published another influential book on [[human proportions]] called ''Vier Bücher von Menschlicher Proportion (Four Books on Human Proportion)'' in 1528.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dürer |first1=Albrecht |title=Hierinn sind begriffen vier Bucher von menschlicher Proportion|url=https://archive.org/details/hierinnsindbegri00dure |publisher=Archive.org |accessdate=24 June 2015 |location=Nurenberg |date=1528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fractal dimensions===

[[File:Batik pedalaman - parang klithik.JPG|thumb|[[Batik]]s from [[Surakarta]], Java, like this ''parang klithik'' sword pattern, have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1.2 and 1.5.]]

Traditional Indonesian wax-resist [[batik]] designs on cloth combine [[representation (arts)|representational]] motifs (such as floral and vegetal elements) with abstract and somewhat chaotic elements, including imprecision in applying the wax resist, and random variation introduced by cracking of the wax. Batik designs have a [[fractal dimension]] between 1 and 2, varying in different regional styles. For example, the batik of [[Cirebon]] has a fractal dimension of 1.1; the batiks of [[Yogyakarta]] and [[Surakarta]] (Solo) in Central [[Java]] have a fractal dimension of 1.2 to 1.5; and the batiks of [[Rembang Regency|Lasem]] on the north coast of Java and of [[Tasikmalaya]] in West Java have a fractal dimension between 1.5 and 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lukman |first1=Muhamad |last2=Hariadi |first2=Yun |last3=Destiarmand |first3=Achmad Haldani |title=Batik Fractal : Traditional Art to Modern Complexity |journal=Proceeding Generative Art X, Milan, Italy |date=2007 |url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/36748400/32.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAJ56TQJRTWSMTNPEA&amp;Expires=1474897246&amp;Signature=kXmu3pdTrpZ1pkw8CLV3GHNR%2FVs%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3DBatik_Fractal_Traditional_Art_to_Modern.pdf |accessdate=26 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[drip painting]] works of the modern artist [[Jackson Pollock]] are similarly distinctive in their fractal dimension. His 1948 ''Number 14'' has a coastline-like dimension of 1.45, while his later paintings had successively higher fractal dimensions and accordingly more elaborate patterns. One of his last works, ''Blue Poles'', took six months to create, and has the fractal dimension of 1.72.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Ouellette |first1=Jennifer |title=Pollock's Fractals |url=http://discovermagazine.com/2001/nov/featpollock |accessdate=26 September 2016 |agency=Discover Magazine |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A complex relationship==
The astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]] in his ''[[Il Saggiatore]]'' wrote that "[The universe] is written in [[patterns in nature|the language of mathematics]], and its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Galilei, Galileo |authorlink=Galileo Galilei |title=The Assayer |year=1623}}, as translated in {{cite book |author=Drake, Stillman |authorlink=Stillman Drake  |year=1957 |title=Discoveries and Opinions of Galileo |publisher=Doubleday |pages=237–238 |isbn=0-385-09239-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists who strive and seek to study nature must first, in Galileo's view, fully understand mathematics. Mathematicians, conversely, have sought to interpret and analyse art through the lens of geometry and rationality. The mathematician Felipe Cucker suggests that mathematics, and especially geometry, is a source of rules for "rule-driven artistic creation", though not the only one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the many strands of the resulting complex relationship&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; are described below.

[[File:Ghhardy@72.jpg|thumb|upright|The mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]] defined a set of criteria for [[mathematical beauty]].]]

===Mathematics as an art===
{{main article|Mathematical beauty}}

The mathematician Jerry P. King describes mathematics as an art, stating that "the keys to mathematics are beauty and elegance and not dullness and technicality", and that beauty is the motivating force for mathematical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; King cites the mathematician [[G. H. Hardy]]'s 1940 essay ''[[A Mathematician's Apology]]''. In it, Hardy discusses why he finds two theorems of [[classical antiquity|classical times]] as first rate, namely [[Euclid]]'s proof there are infinitely many [[prime number]]s, and the proof that the square root of 2 is [[irrational number|irrational]]. King evaluates this last against Hardy's criteria for [[mathematical beauty|mathematical elegance]]: "''seriousness, depth, generality, unexpectedness, inevitability'', and ''economy''" (King's italics), and describes the proof as "aesthetically pleasing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Jerry P. |title=The Art of Mathematics |date=1992 |publisher=Fawcett Columbine |isbn=0-449-90835-6 |pages=135–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hungarian mathematician [[Paul Erdős]] agreed that mathematics possessed beauty but considered the reasons beyond explanation: "Why are numbers beautiful? It's like asking why is [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Beethoven's Ninth Symphony]] beautiful. If you don't see why, someone can't tell you. I ''know'' numbers are beautiful."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Devlin |first=Keith |title=The Math Gene: How Mathematical Thinking Evolved And Why Numbers Are Like Gossip |publisher=Basic Books |year=2000 |page=140 |chapter=Do Mathematicians Have Different Brains? |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AJdmfYEaLG4C |isbn=978-0-465-01619-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist [[Richard Wright]] argues that mathematical objects that can be constructed can be seen either "as processes to simulate phenomena" or as works of "[[computer art]]". He considers the nature of mathematical thought, observing that [[fractals]] were known to mathematicians for a century before they were recognised as such. Wright concludes by stating that it is appropriate to subject mathematical objects to any methods used to "come to terms with cultural artifacts like art, the tension between objectivity and subjectivity, their metaphorical meanings and the character of representational systems." He gives as instances an image from the [[Mandelbrot set]], an image generated by a [[cellular automaton]] algorithm, and a [[rendering (computer graphics)|computer-rendered]] image, and discusses, with reference to the [[Turing test]], whether [[algorithm]]ic products can be art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Richard |title=Some Issues in the Development of Computer Art as a Mathematical Art Form |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |date=1988 |volume=1 |issue=Electronic Art, supplemental issue |pages=103–110 |doi=10.2307/1557919 |jstor=1557919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sasho Kalajdzievski's ''Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics'' takes a similar approach, looking at suitably visual mathematics topics such as tilings, fractals and hyperbolic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kalajdzievski |first1=Sasho |title=Math and Art: An Introduction to Visual Mathematics |date=2008 |publisher=Chapman and Hall |isbn=978-1-58488-913-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematician and [[theoretical physicist]] [[Henri Poincaré]]'s ''[[Science and Hypothesis]]'' was widely read by the [[Cubism|Cubists]], including [[Pablo Picasso]] and [[Jean Metzinger]].&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miller, Arthur I. |title=Insights of Genius: Imagery and Creativity in Science and Art |publisher=Springer |year=2012 |isbn=1-4612-2388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poincaré viewed [[Euclidean geometry]] as just one of many possible geometric configurations, rather than as an absolute objective truth. The possible existence of a [[Fourth dimension in art|fourth dimension]] inspired artists to question classical [[Perspective (graphical)#Renaissance&amp;nbsp;: Mathematical basis|Renaissance perspective]]: [[non-Euclidean geometry]] became a valid alternative.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;{{cite book |author=Henderson, Linda D. |title=The Fourth Dimension and Non-Euclidean geometry in Modern Art |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://eres.lndproxy.org/edoc/AH317Antliff-09.pdf |author1=Antliff, Mark |author2=Leighten, Patricia Dee |title=Cubism and Culture |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |year=2001 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Everdell |first=William R. |authorlink=William Everdell |title=The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-Century Thought |year=1997 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-22480-5 |page=312}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept that painting could be expressed mathematically, in colour and form, contributed to Cubism, the art movement that led to [[abstract art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Green, Christopher |title=Cubism and its Enemies, Modern Movements and Reaction in French Art, 1916–1928 |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1987 |pages=13–47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Metzinger, in 1910, wrote that: "[Picasso] lays out a free, mobile perspective, from which that ingenious mathematician [[Maurice Princet]] has deduced a whole geometry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |date=October–November 1910 |title=Note sur la peinture |journal=Pan |page=60}} in {{cite book |last=Miller |title=Einstein, Picasso |publisher=Basic Books |page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Metzinger wrote in his memoirs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Maurice Princet joined us often&amp;nbsp;... it was as an artist that he conceptualized mathematics, as an aesthetician that he invoked ''n''-dimensional continuums. He loved to get the artists interested in the [[Schlegel diagram|new views on space]] that had been opened up by [[Victor Schlegel|Schlegel]] and some others. He succeeded at that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzinger |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Metzinger |title=Le cubisme était né |year=1972 |publisher=Éditions Présence |pages=43–44}} in {{cite book |last=Ferry |first=Luc |authorlink=Luc Ferry |others=Robert De Loaiza, trans. |title=Homo Aestheticus: The Invention of Taste in the Democratic Age |year=1993 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=0-226-24459-8 |page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The impulse to make teaching or research models of mathematical forms naturally creates objects that have symmetries and surprising or pleasing shapes. Some of these have inspired artists such as the [[Dadaism|Dadaists]] [[Man Ray]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Man Ray–Human Equations A Journey from Mathematics to Shakespeare.

[[File:Objet mathematique by Man Ray.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Enneper surface]]s as [[Dadaism]]: [[Man Ray]]'s 1934 ''Objet mathematique'']]
Man Ray photographed some of the mathematical models in the [[Institut Henri Poincaré]] in Paris, including ''Objet mathematique'' (Mathematical object). He noted that this represented [[Enneper surface]]s with constant [[negative curvature]], derived from the [[pseudo-sphere]]. This mathematical foundation was important to him, as it allowed him to deny that the object was "abstract", instead claiming that it was as real as the urinal that Duchamp made into a work of art. Man Ray admitted that the object's [Enneper surface] formula "meant nothing to me, but the forms themselves were as varied and authentic as any in nature." He used his photographs of the mathematical models as figures in his series he did on [[Shakespeare]]'s plays, such as his 1934 painting ''Antony and Cleopatra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tubbs |first1=Robert |title=Mathematics in 20th-Century Literature and Art |date=2014 |publisher=Johns Hopkins |isbn=978-1-4214-1380-8 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The art reporter Jonathan Keats, writing in ''ForbesLife'', argues that Man Ray photographed "the elliptic paraboloids and conic points in the same sensual light as his pictures of [[Kiki de Montparnasse]]", and "ingeniously repurposes the cool calculations of mathematics to reveal the topology of desire".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keats |first1=Jonathon |title=See How Man Ray Made Elliptic Paraboloids Erotic At This Phillips Collection Photography Exhibit |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jonathonkeats/2015/02/13/see-how-man-ray-made-elliptic-paraboloids-sexy-at-this-phillips-collection-photography-exhibit/ |publisher=Forbes |accessdate=10 September 2015 |date=13 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twentieth century sculptors such as [[Henry Moore]], [[Barbara Hepworth]] and [[Naum Gabo]] took inspiration from mathematical models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=311–312 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore wrote of his 1938 ''Stringed Mother and Child'': "Undoubtedly the source of my stringed figures was the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]]&amp;nbsp;...

[[File:Theo van Doesburg 122.jpg|thumb|upright=0.4|[[Theo van Doesburg]]'s ''Six Moments in the Development of Plane to Space'', 1926 or 1929]]

The artists [[Theo van Doesburg]] and [[Piet Mondrian]] founded the [[De Stijl]] movement, which they wanted to "establish a visual vocabulary {{sic|comprised |hide=y|of}} elementary geometrical forms comprehensible by all and adaptable to any discipline".&lt;ref name=tate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tate.org.uk/learn/online-resources/glossary/d/de-stijl |title=De Stijl |accessdate=11 September 2015 |work=Tate Glossary |publisher=The Tate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Curl |first=James Stevens |title=A Dictionary of Architecture and Landscape Architecture |year=2006 |edition=Second |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-860678-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their artworks visibly consist of ruled squares and triangles, sometimes also with circles. De Stijl artists worked in painting, furniture, interior design and architecture.&lt;ref name=tate/&gt; After the breakup of De Stijl, Van Doesburg founded the [[Avant-garde]] [[Art Concret]] movement, describing his 1929–1930 ''[https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Theo_van_Doesburg_218.jpg Arithmetic Composition]'', a series of four black squares on the diagonal of a squared background, as "a structure that can be controlled, a ''definite'' surface without chance elements or individual caprice", yet "not lacking in spirit, not lacking the universal and not&amp;nbsp;... empty as there is ''everything'' which fits the internal rhythm". The art critic Gladys Fabre observes that two progressions are at work in the painting, namely the growing black squares and the alternating backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Tubbs, Robert |title=Mathematics in Twentieth-Century Literature and Art: Content, Form, Meaning  |year=2014 |publisher=JHU Press |pages=44–47 |isbn=978-1-4214-1402-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[tessellation]], polyhedra, shaping of space, and self-reference provided the graphic artist [[M. C. Escher]] (1898—1972) with a lifetime's worth of materials for his woodcuts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nga.gov/collection/gallery/ggescher/ggescher-main1.html |title=Tour: M.C.

Escher used irregular polygons when tiling the plane and often used reflections, [[glide reflection]]s, and [[Translation (geometry)|translations]] to obtain further patterns. Many of his works contain impossible constructions, made using geometrical objects which set up a contradiction between perspective projection and three dimensions, but are pleasant to the human sight. Escher's ''[[Ascending and Descending]]'' is based on the "[[Penrose stairs|impossible staircase]]" created by the medical scientist [[Lionel Penrose]] and his son the mathematician [[Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penrose |first1=L.S. |last2=Penrose |first2=R. |title=Impossible objects: A special type of visual illusion |journal=[[British Journal of Psychology]] |year=1958 |volume=49 |pages=31–33 |doi=10.1111/j.2044-8295.1958.tb00634.x |pmid=13536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kirousis |first1=Lefteris M. |last2=Papadimitriou |first2=Christos H. |author2-link=Christos Papadimitriou |title=The complexity of recognizing polyhedral scenes |doi=10.1109/sfcs.1985.59 |pages=175–185 |work=[[Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science|26th Annual Symposium on Foundations of Computer Science]] (FOCS 1985) |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cooper |first=Martin |contribution=Tractability of Drawing Interpretation |doi=10.1007/978-1-84800-229-6_9 |isbn=978-1-84800-229-6 |pages=217–230 |publisher=Springer-Verlag |title=Line Drawing Interpretation |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Escher's many tessellation drawings were inspired by conversations with the mathematician [[H. S. M. Coxeter]] on [[hyperbolic geometry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Roberts, Siobhan |authorlink=Siobhan Roberts|work=King of Infinite Space: Donald Coxeter, the Man Who Saved Geometry |page=Chapter 11 |title='Coxetering' with M.C. Escher |publisher=Walker |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escher was especially interested in five specific polyhedra, which appear many times in his work. The [[Platonic solids]]—tetrahedrons, cubes, octahedrons, dodecahedrons, and icosahedrons—are especially prominent in ''Order and Chaos'' and ''Four Regular Solids''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Escher, M.C. |title=The World of MC Escher |publisher=Random House |date=1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stellated figures often reside within another figure which further distorts the viewing angle and conformation of the polyhedrons and provides a multifaceted perspective artwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Escher, M.C. |author2=Vermeulen, M.W. |author3=Ford, K. |title=Escher on Escher: Exploring the Infinite |year=1989 |publisher=HN Abrams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visual intricacy of mathematical structures such as tessellations and polyhedra have inspired a variety of mathematical artworks. [[Stewart Coffin]] makes polyhedral puzzles in rare and beautiful woods; [[George W. Hart]] works on the theory of [[polyhedra]] and sculpts objects inspired by them; [[Magnus Wenninger]] makes "especially beautiful" models of [[List of Wenninger polyhedron models|complex stellated polyhedra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malkevitch |first1=Joseph |title=Mathematics and Art. 5.

The distorted perspectives of [[anamorphosis]] have been explored in art since the sixteenth century, when [[Hans Holbein the Younger]] incorporated a severely distorted skull in his 1533 painting ''[[The Ambassadors (Holbein)|The Ambassadors]]''. Many artists since then, including Escher, have make use of anamorphic tricks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Marcolli, Matilde |authorlink=Matilde Marcolli |title=The notion of Space in Mathematics through the lens of Modern Art |publisher=Century Books |date=July 2016 |url=http://www.its.caltech.edu/~matilde/SpaceMathArticle.pdf |pages=23–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mathematics of [[topology]] has inspired several artists in modern times. The sculptor [[John Robinson (sculptor)|John Robinson]] (1935–2007) created works such as ''Gordian Knot'' and ''Bands of Friendship'', displaying [[knot theory]] in polished bronze.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt; Other works by Robinson explore the topology of [[torus]]es.

===Illustrating mathematics===

[[File:Polittico Stefaneschi, dettaglio.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.5|Detail of Cardinal Stefaneschi holding the triptych]]

Modelling is far from the only possible way to illustrate mathematical concepts. Giotto's ''[[Stefaneschi Triptych]]'', 1320, illustrates [[recursion]] in the form of ''[[mise en abyme]]''; the central panel of the triptych contains, lower left, the kneeling figure of Cardinal Stefaneschi, holding up the triptych as an offering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Giotto di Bondone and assistants: Stefaneschi triptych |url=http://mv.vatican.va/3_EN/pages/PIN/PIN_Sala02_03.html |publisher=The Vatican |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Giorgio Chirico]]'s [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] paintings such as his 1917 ''Great Metaphysical Interior'' explore the question of levels of representation in art by depicting paintings within his paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=337–338 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Art can exemplify logical paradoxes, as in some paintings by the [[surrealist]] [[René Magritte]], which can be read as [[semiotic]] jokes about confusion between levels. In ''[[The Human Condition (painting)|La condition humaine]]'' (1933), Magritte depicts an easel (on the real canvas), seamlessly supporting a view through a window which is framed by "real" curtains in the painting. Similarly, Escher's ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' (1956) is a print which depicts a distorted city which contains a gallery which [[recursive]]ly contains the picture, and so ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cooper |first1=Jonathan |title=Art and Mathematics |url=http://www.doctordada.com/art/art-and-mathematics/ |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magritte made use of spheres and cuboids to distort reality in a different way, painting them alongside an assortment of houses in his 1931 ''Mental Arithmetic'' as if they were children's building blocks, but house-sized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-14-028920-6 |page=627}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed that the "eerie toytown image" prophesied [[Modernism]]'s usurpation of "cosy traditional forms", but also plays with the human tendency to seek [[patterns in nature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hall |first1=James |title=René Magritte: The Pleasure Principle – exhibition |url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2011/jun/10/rene-magritte-pleasure-principle-exhibition |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salvador Dalí's last painting, ''[[The Swallow's Tail]]'' (1983), was part of a series inspired by [[René Thom]]'s [[catastrophe theory]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;{{cite book |last1=King |first1=Elliott |editor1-last=Ades |editor1-first=Dawn |title=Dali |date=2004 |publisher=Bompiani Arte |location=Milan |pages=418–421}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish painter and sculptor [[Pablo Palazuelo]] (1916–2007) focused on the investigation of form. He developed a style that he described as the geometry of life and the geometry of all nature. Consisting of simple geometric shapes with detailed patterning and coloring, in works such as ''Angular I'' and ''Automnes'', Palazuelo expressed himself in geometric transformations.&lt;ref name=Emmer/&gt;

[[File:Print Gallery by M. C. Escher.jpg|thumb|upright|Lithograph ''[[Print Gallery (M. C. Escher)|Print Gallery]]'' by [[M. C. Escher]], 1956]]

Artists, however, do not necessarily take geometry literally. As [[Douglas Hofstadter]] writes in his 1980 reflection on human thought, ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', by way of (among other things) the mathematics of art: "The difference between an Escher drawing and [[non-Euclidean geometry]] is that in the latter, comprehensible interpretations can be found for the undefined terms, resulting in a comprehensible total system, whereas for the former, the end result is not reconcilable with one's conception of the world, no matter how long one stares at the pictures." Hofstadter discusses the seemingly [[paradox]]ical lithograph ''Print Gallery'' by M. C. Escher; it depicts a seaside town containing an art gallery which seems to contain a painting of the seaside town, there being a "strange loop, or tangled hierarchy" to the levels of reality in the image. The artist himself, Hofstadter observes, is not seen; his reality and his relation to the lithograph are not paradoxical.&lt;ref name=GEB&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hofstadter |first1=Douglas R. |authorlink=Douglas Hofstadter |title=Gödel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid |titlelink=Gödel, Escher, Bach |date=1980 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=978-0-394-74502-2 |pages=98–99, 690–717}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image's central void has also attracted the interest of mathematicians Bart de Smit and [[Hendrik Lenstra]], who propose that it could contain a [[Droste effect]] copy of itself, rotated and shrunk; this would be a further illustration of recursion beyond that noted by Hofstadter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=de Smit |first=B. |title=The Mathematical Structure of Escher's Print Gallery |year=2003 |journal=[[Notices of the American Mathematical Society]] |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=446–451}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LenstraWebsite&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lenstra |first1=Hendrik |last2=De Smit |first2=Bart |title=Applying mathematics to Escher's Print Gallery |url=http://escherdroste.math.leidenuniv.nl/index.php?menu=intro |publisher=Leiden University |accessdate=10 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analysis of art history===

Algorithmic analysis of images of artworks, for example using [[X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy]], can reveal information about art. Such techniques can uncover images in layers of paint later covered over by an artist; help art historians to visualize an artwork before it cracked or faded; help to tell a copy from an original, or distinguish the brushstroke style of a master from those of his apprentices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stanek |first1=Becca |title=Van Gogh and the Algorithm: How Math Can Save Art |url=http://time.com/2884058/math-art-van-gogh-duke/ |publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=16 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sipics |first1=Michelle |title=The Van Gogh Project: Art Meets Mathematics in Ongoing International Study |url=https://www.siam.org/news/news.php?id=1568 |publisher=Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics |accessdate=4 September 2015 |date=18 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is highly unlikely, therefore, that Pollock consciously understood the fractals he was painting. Nevertheless, his introduction of fractals was deliberate. For example, the colour of the anchor layer was chosen to produce the sharpest contrast against the canvas background and this layer also occupies more canvas space than the other layers, suggesting that Pollock wanted this highly fractal anchor layer to visually dominate the painting. Furthermore, after the paintings were completed, he would dock the canvas to remove regions near the canvas edge where the pattern density was less uniform. |doi=10.1088/2058-7058/12/10/21 |volume=12 |pages=25–28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Ernst painted [[Lissajous figures]] directly by swinging a punctured bucket of paint over a canvas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.herts.ac.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0013/12307/WPIAAD_vol2_king.pdf |title=From Max Ernst to Ernst Mach: epistemology in art and science. |last=King |first=M. |date=2002 |accessdate=17 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The computer scientist [[Neil Dodgson]] investigated whether [[Bridget Riley]]'s stripe paintings could be characterised mathematically, concluding that while separation distance could "provide some characterisation" and global [[entropy]] worked on some paintings, [[autocorrelation]] failed as Riley's patterns were irregular. Local entropy worked best, and correlated well with the description given by the art critic Robert Kudielka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dodgson |first1=N. A. |title=Mathematical characterisation of Bridget Riley's stripe paintings |journal=[[Journal of Mathematics and the Arts]] |date=2012 |volume=5 |pages=1–21 |url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~nad10/pubs/jma12.pdf |quote=over the course [of] the early 1980s, Riley's patterns moved from more regular to more random (as characterised by global entropy), without losing their rhythmic structure (as characterised by local entropy). This reflects Kudielka's description of her artistic development. |doi=10.1080/17513472.2012.679468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American mathematician [[George Birkhoff]]'s 1933 ''Aesthetic Measure'' proposes a quantitative metric of the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic quality]] of an artwork. It does not attempt to measure the connotations of a work, such as what a painting might mean, but is limited to the "elements of order" of a polygonal figure. Birkhoff first combines (as a sum) five such elements: whether there is a vertical axis of symmetry; whether there is optical equilibrium; how many rotational symmetries it has; how wallpaper-like the figure is; and whether there are unsatisfactory features such as having two vertices too close together. This metric, ''O'', takes a value between −3 and 7. The second metric, ''C'', counts elements of the figure, which for a polygon is the number of different straight lines containing at least one of its sides. Birkhoff then defines his aesthetic measure of an object's beauty as ''O/C''. This can be interpreted as a balance between the pleasure looking at the object gives, and the amount of effort needed to take it in. Birkhoff's proposal has been criticized in various ways, not least for trying to put beauty in a formula, but he never claimed to have done that.&lt;ref name=Cucker116&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=116–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stimuli to mathematical research===

{{further information|Projective geometry|Mathematics of paper folding}}

Art has sometimes stimulated the development of mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research that led to the work of [[Brook Taylor]] and [[Johann Heinrich Lambert]] on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Treibergs |first1=Andrejs |title=The Geometry of Perspective Drawing on the Computer |url=http://www.math.utah.edu/~treiberg/Perspect/Perspect.htm |publisher=University of Utah |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=24 July 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately to the mathematics of [[projective geometry]] of [[Girard Desargues]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=xviii |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illusion to Op art===
{{further information|Op art}}

[[File:Fraser spiral.svg|thumb|upright|The [[Fraser spiral illusion]], named for Sir James Fraser who discovered it in 1908.]]

[[Optical illusion]]s such as the [[Fraser spiral illusion|Fraser spiral]] strikingly demonstrate limitations in human visual perception, creating what the [[art historian]] [[Ernst Gombrich]] called a "baffling trick." The black and white ropes that appear to form [[spiral]]s are in fact [[concentric circle]]s. The mid-twentieth century [[Op art|Op art or optical art]] style of painting and graphics exploited such effects to create the impression of movement and flashing or vibrating patterns seen in the work of artists such as [[Bridget Riley]]&lt;!--slight overlink seems sensible here--&gt;, Spyros Horemis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cucker |first1=Felix |title=Manifold Mirrors: The Crossing Paths of the Arts and Mathematics |date=2013 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-72876-8 |pages=163–166}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Victor Vasarely]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gamwell |first1=Lynn |title=Mathematics and Art: A Cultural History |date=2015 |publisher=Princeton University Press |pages=406–410 |isbn=978-0-691-16528-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sacred geometry===
{{further information|Sacred geometry|Mathematics and music}}

A strand of art from Ancient Greece onwards sees God as the geometer of the world, and the world's geometry therefore as sacred. The belief that God created the universe according to a geometric plan has ancient origins. [[Plutarch]] attributed the belief to [[Plato]], writing that "Plato said God geometrizes continually" (''Convivialium disputationum'', liber 8,2). This image has influenced Western thought ever since. The Platonic concept derived in its turn from a [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean]] notion of harmony in music, where the notes were spaced in perfect proportions, corresponding to the lengths of the lyre's strings; indeed, the Pythagoreans held that everything was arranged by Number. In the same way, in Platonic thought, the [[Platonic solid|regular or Platonic solids]] dictate the proportions found in nature, and in art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ghyka |first1=Matila |title=The Geometry of Art and Life |date=2003 |publisher=Dover |isbn=978-0-486-23542-4 |pages=ix–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lawlor |first1=Robert |title=Sacred Geometry: Philosophy and Practice |date=1982 |publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson |isbn=978-0-500-81030-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Mediaeval manuscript illustration may refer to a verse in the Old Testament: "When he established the heavens I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the deep" (Proverbs 8:27), showing God drawing out the universe with a pair of compasses.&lt;ref name=Calter&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calter |first1=Paul |title=Celestial Themes in Art &amp; Architecture |url=https://www.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit10/unit10.html |publisher=Dartmouth College |accessdate=5 September 2015 |date=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1596, the mathematical astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] modelled the universe as a set of nested Platonic solids, determining the relative sizes of the orbits of the planets.&lt;ref name=Calter/&gt; [[William Blake]]'s ''Ancient of Days'' and his painting of the physicist [[Isaac Newton]], naked and drawing with a compass, attempt to depict the contrast between the mathematically perfect spiritual world and the imperfect physical world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Thought of a Thought – Edgar Allan Poe |url=http://www.mathpages.com/home/kmath522/kmath522.htm |publisher=MathPages |accessdate=5 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as in a different way does [[Salvador Dalí]]'s 1954 ''[[Crucifixion (Corpus Hypercubus)]]'', which depicts the cross as a [[hypercube]], representing the divine perspective with four dimensions rather than the usual three.&lt;ref name=CorpusHypercubus /&gt; In Dali's ''[[The Sacrament of the Last Supper]]'' (1955) Christ and his disciples are pictured inside a giant [[dodecahedron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Livio |first1=Mario |authorlink=Mario Livio |title=The golden ratio and aesthetics |url=https://plus.maths.org/content/golden-ratio-and-aesthetics |accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''natural building''' involves a range of [[building]] systems and materials that place major emphasis on [[sustainability]].  Ways of achieving sustainability through natural building focus on durability and the use of minimally processed, plentiful or [[renewable resource]]s, as well as those that, while [[Recycling|recycled]] or salvaged, produce healthy living environments and maintain indoor air quality. Natural building tends to rely on human labor, more than technology. As Michael G. Smith observes, it depends on "local ecology, geology and climate; on the character of the particular building site, and on the needs and personalities of the builders and users."&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "The Case for Natural Building," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek (2002), 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of natural building is the need to lessen the [[natural environment|environmental]] impact of buildings and other supporting systems, without sacrificing comfort or health. To be more sustainable, natural building uses primarily abundantly available, renewable, reused or recycled materials.  The use of rapidly renewable materials is increasingly a focus. In addition to relying on natural building materials, the emphasis on the architectural design is heightened. The orientation of a building, the utilization of local climate and site conditions, the emphasis on natural ventilation through design, fundamentally lessen operational costs and positively impact the environment. Building compactly and minimizing the [[ecological footprint]] is common, as are on-site handling of energy acquisition, on-site water capture, alternate sewage treatment and water reuse.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}
[[Image:timber frame detail.jpg|thumb|right|400px|&lt;center&gt;Porch of a modern timber framed home&lt;/center&gt;]]

==Materials==
The materials common to many types of natural building are clay and sand.  When mixed with water and, usually, straw or another fiber, the mixture may form ''[[cob (material)|cob]]'' or ''[[adobe]]'' (clay blocks).  Other materials commonly used in natural building are: earth (as [[rammed earth]] or [[Earthbag construction|earth bag]]), wood ([[cordwood construction|cordwood]] or [[timber frame]]/post-and-beam), [[straw-bale construction|straw]], rice-hulls, [[bamboo]] and [[rock (geology)|stone]]. A wide variety of reused or [[recycled]] non-toxic materials are common in natural building, including urbanite (salvaged chunks of used concrete), vehicle windscreens and other recycled glass.

Other materials are avoided by practitioners of this building approach, due to their major negative environmental or health impacts.  These include unsustainably harvested wood, toxic wood-preservatives, [[portland cement]]-based mixes and derived products such as [[Autoclaved aerated concrete]], paints and other coatings that off-gas [[volatile organic compound]]s (VOCs), steel, waste materials such as rubber tires in regions where they are recycled, and some plastics; particularly [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC or "vinyl") and those containing harmful plasticizers or hormone-mimicking formulations.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Techniques==
Many traditional techniques and materials are now experiencing a resurgence of popularity. This differs around the world based on climate appropriate building design and the availability of local materials.

===Adobe===
{{Main|Adobe|Mudbrick}}

One of the oldest building methods, adobe is simply clay and sand mixed with water. Often, chopped straw or other fibers are added for strength. The mixture is then allowed to dry in the desired shape. Usually adobe is shaped into bricks that can be stacked to form walls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=127–128|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA127&amp;dq=adobe%20bricks%20walls&amp;pg=PA127#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various claims are made about the optimal proportions of clay and sand (or larger aggregate). Some say that the best adobe soil contains 15% - 30% clay to bind the material together. Others say equal proportions of clay and sand are best to prevent cracking or fragmenting of the bricks. The blocks can either be poured into molds and dried, or pressed into blocks. Adobe colored with clay and polished with natural oil makes an attractive and resilient floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gibson|first=Scott|title=The Workshop: Celebrating the Place Where Craftsmanship Begins|year=2003|publisher=Taunton Press|location=Newton, CT|isbn=978-1-56158-575-5|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJJYdkQw_uYC&amp;lpg=PA172&amp;dq=adobe%20floor%20oil&amp;pg=PA172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|author2=Anthony, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect the walls and reduce maintenance, adobe buildings usually have large overhanging eaves and sizeable foundations. Adobe can be plastered over with cob or lime-based mixes for both appearance and protection.  Adobe has good thermal mass, meaning that it is slow to transmit heat or cold. It is not a good insulator, however, so insulation can be added (preferably on the outside), or a double wall built with airspace or insulation in between.  The traditional thick, un-insulated adobe has proven to perform best in regions without harsh winters or where daily sun is predictably available during those cold periods.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cob===
{{Main|Cob (building)}}
[[File:Cob with living roof.jpg|thumb|A small cob building with a [[living roof]]]]
The term ''cob'' is used to describe a monolithic building system based on a mixture of clay, sand, straw and earth. The construction uses no forms, bricks or wooden framework; it is built from the ground up. Various forms of "mud" building have been used in many parts of the world for centuries, under a variety of names, and date from at least 10,000 years ago. Cob building began use in England prior to the 13th century, and fell out of favor after World War I, although it is seeing a resurgence today. Cob is one of the simplest and least expensive building techniques available, though it is typically very labor-intensive. Cob's other great advantage is versatility; It can easily be shaped into any form.  While cob building was falling out of favor in England by the late 19th century, thousands of cob structures have endured to the present (20,000 in [[Devon]], England alone).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Michael G. "Cob Building, Ancient and Modern," in Kennedy, Smith and Wanek, (2002), 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that from one third to one half of the world's population lives in earthen dwellings today.  Although typically associated with "low-rise" structures, in [[Yemen]] and other Middle-Eastern countries it has, for centuries, been used in "apartment" buildings of eight stories and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Ianto|title=The Hand-sculpted House|year=2002|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub. Co.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-34-7|page=xv|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tGEmmolyeSUC&amp;lpg=PR15&amp;dq=yemen%20cob%20apartment&amp;pg=PR15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cob-like mixes are also used as plaster or filler in several methods of natural building, such as adobe, earth bags, timber frames, cordwood, and straw bales. Earth is thus a primary ingredient of natural building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Cordwood===
{{Main|Cordwood construction}}
[[Image:Cordwoodhouse.jpg|150px|right|thumb|&lt;center&gt;A section of a cordwood home.]]
'''Cordwood construction''' is a term used for a natural building method in which "cordwood" or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with [[masonry]] or [[Cob (building)|cob]] mixtures to build a wall. The cordwood, thus, becomes infill for the walls, usually between posts in a [[timber frame]] structure. Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods  (e.g., [[rammed earth]], cob or [[light clay]]) to produce attractive combinations. Cordwood masonry construction provides a relatively high [[thermal mass]], which helps to minimise fluctuations in temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chiras|first=Daniel D.|title=The Natural House: A Complete Guide to Healthy, Energy-efficient, Environmental Homes|year=2000|publisher=Chelsea Green Pub.|location=White River Junction, Vt.|isbn=978-1-890132-57-6|pages=178–179|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z_Y2AObA-joC&amp;lpg=PA178&amp;dq=cordwood%20thermal%20mass&amp;pg=PA178#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Earthbag===
{{Main|Earthbag construction|Super Adobe}}

Earth is the most typical fill material used in bag-wall construction techniques.  This building method utilizes stacked polypropylene or natural-fiber (burlap) bags filled with earth or other mixes without a stabilizer, other than clay, to form footings, foundations, walls and even vaulted or domed roofs. In recent years, building with earth bags has become one of the increasingly practiced techniques in natural building. It facilitates self-contained, often free-form rammed-earth structures. Its growing popularity relates to its use of an abundant and readily available often site-available material (earth) in a potentially inexpensive building technique that is flexible, and easy to learn and use.  However, because earth is a poor insulator, in more extreme climates other filler variations are now being explored, substituting pumice, rice-hulls or another material with better insulating value for all or part of the earth (''see also'' [[Rice-hull bagwall construction]]).{{refimprove|date=June 2012}}

=== Hempcrete ===
[[Hempcrete]] or Hemplime is bio-composite material, a mixture of [[hemp hurds]] (shives) and [[Lime (material)|lime]] (possibly including [[hydraulic lime|natural hydraulic lime]],&lt;ref&gt;Allin, Steve. ''Building with Hemp'', Seed Press, 2005, {{ISBN|978-0-9551109-0-0}}. (p. 146, 1st Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; [[sand]], [[pozzolan]]s) used as a material for construction and [[Building insulation|insulation]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is marketed under names like Hempcrete, Canobiote, Canosmose, and Isochanvre.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"&gt;{{cite journal
|url=http://www.naturallifemagazine.com/0604/hemphouse.htm |title=Hemp For Houses |first=Rolf B. |last=Priesnitz |work=Natural Life Magazine |date=March–April 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hempcrete is easier to work with than traditional lime mixes and acts as an insulator and moisture regulator. It lacks the [[brittleness]] of concrete and consequently does not need [[expansion joint]]s.&lt;ref name="Priesnitz"/&gt; The result is a lightweight insulating material ideal for most climates as it combines insulation and thermal mass.

Like other plant products, [[hemp]] absorbs [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] from the atmosphere as it grows, retaining the [[carbon]] and releasing the [[oxygen]].  Theoretically 165&amp;nbsp;kg of carbon can be absorbed and locked up by 1&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of hempcrete wall during manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanlimetec.com/tradical-hemcrete/|title=Tradical Hemcrete 2008 Information Pack|publisher=American Lime Technology|accessdate=2010-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore the carbonation of the lime during curing adds to this effect as lime turns to [[limestone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.minoeco.com/en/constructions/hempcrete|title=Minoeco - Natural Plasters &amp; Bioclimatic Design, Hempcrete|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical [[compressive strength]] is around 1&amp;nbsp;MPa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 1/20 that of residential grade [[concrete]]. It is a low density material and resistant to crack under movement thus making it highly suitable for use in earthquake-prone areas. Hempcrete walls must be used together with a frame of another material that supports the vertical load in building construction, as hempcrete's [[density]] is 15% that of traditional concrete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rammed earth===
{{Main|Rammed earth}}
Rammed earth is a wall system made of compacted earth, or another material that is compacted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/pise Pisé terminology]&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely strong and durable. Quality rammed earth walls are dense, solid, and stone-like with great environmental benefits and superior low maintenance characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} As an option depending on climate rigid insulation can be placed inside the wall. Similarly, depending on seismic concerns bamboo or other tensile natural materials can be used to reinforce the wall.

Rammed earth has been used for around 10,000 years in all types of buildings from low rise to high-rise and from small huts to palaces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Rammed earth walls are formed in place by pounding damp sub-soil (containing sand, clay and sometimes gravel) into movable, reusable forms with manual or machine-powered tampers. In traditional rammed earth, a mixture of around 70% aggregate (gravel,sand) and 30% clay is optimal. Pigmentation may be added in the mix to achieve the desired color. Around 5-10&amp;nbsp;inches of mixed damp sub-soil are placed inside the forms and pounded to total compaction and the process is repeated until the desired height is achieved. What is left after the forms are removed is a wall that is structural and can last over 1000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

===Stone===


Stone has been used as a building material for thousands of years. It has long been recognized as a material of great durability. The pyramids in Giza, burial chambers in the UK and temples in Malta were all built from stone over 4000 years ago and are still standing. The earliest form of stone construction is known as dry stone, or dry stacking. These are freestanding structures such as field walls, bridges and buildings that use irregularly shaped stones carefully selected and placed so that they fit closely together without slipping. Structures are typically wider at the base and taper in as height increases. They do not require any special tools, only the skill of the craftsman in choosing and placing the stones.

Traditional stone masonry evolved from dry stone stacking. Stone blocks are laid in rows of even (courses) or uneven (un-coursed) height, and fixed in place with lime mortar pasted between the stones. Traditional stone masonry is rarely used today because stone is expensive to quarry, cut and transport, and the building process is labor and skill-intensive. 

Stone is a highly durable, low maintenance building material with high thermal mass. It is versatile, available in many shapes, sizes, colors and textures, and can be used for floors, walls, arches and roofs. Stone blends well with the [[natural landscape]], and can easily be recycled for other building purposes.

===Straw bale===
{{Main|Straw bale construction}}
[[Image:strawbaleconstruction.jpg|thumb|right|300px|&lt;center&gt;Straw bale construction in Santa Cruz, CA&lt;/center&gt;]]

Although [[grasses]] and [[straw]] have been in use in a range of ways in building since pre-history around the world, their incorporation in machine-manufactured modular [[Baler|bales]] seems to date back to the early 20th century in the midwestern United States, particularly the sand-hills of [[Nebraska]], where grass was plentiful and other building materials (even quality [[sod]]s) were not. Straw bale building typically consists of stacking a series of rows of bales (often in running-bond) on a raised footing or [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], with a moisture barrier between. Bale walls are often tied together with pins of bamboo or wood (internal to the bales or on their faces), or with surface wire meshes, and then [[stucco]]ed or [[plaster]]ed using either lime-based formulations or earth/clay renders.  Bale buildings can either have a structural frame of other materials, with bales between (simply serving as insulation and stucco substrate), referred to as "infill", or the bales may actually provide the support for openings and roof, referred to as "[[load-bearing]]" or "Nebraska-style", or a combination of [[framing (construction)|framing]] and load-bearing may be employed, referred to a "hybrid" straw bale.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Typically, bales created on farms with mobile machinery have been used ("field-bales"), but recently higher-density "recompressed" bales (or "straw-blocks") are increasing the loads that may be supported; where field bales might support around 600 pounds per linear foot of wall, the high density bales bear up to 4,000&amp;nbsp;lb./lin.ft.

===Timber frame===

The basic elements of timber frame building&amp;mdash;joined timbers, clay walls and [[Thatched roof|thatch roofs]] were in place in Europe and Asia by the 9th century. It remained the common mode of house construction in northern cultures until the 19th century.  Craftsmanship was, and is, an important value in timber frame building.  The oldest timber frame structures (for example, the timber framed stave churches of [[Scandinavia]]) show both craftsmanship and a strong grasp of the technical aspects of structural design, as do such structures in [[Japan]].{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing typically uses a "[[Bent (structural)|bent]]."  A bent is a structural support, like a [[truss]], consisting of two posts, a tie beam and two rafters. These are connected into a framework through joinery. To practice the craft, one must understand the basic structural aspects of the bent.  This, along with a knowledge of [[joiner]]y, are the basis of timber frame building.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Timber framing is now a modern method of construction, Ideally suited to mass house building as well as public buildings. In conjunction with a number of natural insulations and timber cladding or modern [[lime render]]s, it is possible to quickly construct a high performance, sustainable building, using completely natural products. The benefits are many&amp;mdash;the building performs better over its lifespan, waste is reduced (much can be re-cycled, composted or used as fuel). Timber frame structures are frequently used in combination with other natural building techniques, such as cob, straw bale, or cordwood/masonry.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18996">'''Neoabolitionist''' (or '''neo-abolitionist''' or '''new abolitionism''') is  a term used in [[historiography]] to characterize historians of race relations motivated by the spirit of racial equality typified by the abolitionists who fought to abolish slavery in the mid-19th century.  They write especially about [[African-American]] history, slavery, the [[American Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction Era]].

As abolitionists had worked in the 19th century to end slavery and provide equal rights under the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]] to blacks, the new activists worked to enforce constitutional rights for all citizens and restore equality under the law for African Americans, including [[suffrage]] and [[civil rights]].

In the late 20th century some historians emphasized the worlds of African Americans in their own words, in their own communities, to recognize them as agents, not victims. Publishing in the mid-1960s and through the 20th century, a new generation of historians began to revise traditional accounts of slavery in the United States, reconstruction, [[racial segregation]] and [[Jim Crow]] laws. Some major historians began to apply the term "neoabolitionist" to such historians, and some of this group identified as such.

==Early 20th century: Dunning School==
{{main|Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era (United States)}}
Many early 20th-century histories of the abolitionists and of the Reconstruction Era gave harsh assessments to the movement and the attempts by the federal government to force a transition in the South to a new social system. For instance, what was called the [[Dunning School]], an influential group of white historians led by [[William Archibald Dunning]] at [[Columbia University]], assessed Reconstruction as marred by African-American participation, saying that all the state legislatures were dominated by freedmen, that they were incompetent to govern; that they had been misled by northern carpetbaggers; and that these governments of the postwar decades were unusually corrupt.

In the 19th century after Reconstruction, former abolitionists, especially [[African American]]s such as [[Frederick Douglass]], presented positive views of its achievements: gaining of [[civil rights]] for African Americans, and expanded [[suffrage]] to include poor whites. In the early 20th century, [[Fisk University]] historian [[Alrutheus Taylor]] described the period of Reconstruction in [[North Carolina]] and [[Tennessee]] in several books and articles. [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a leading Marxist historian, published his ''Black Reconstruction in America'' in 1935, challenging the Dunning School. Du Bois stressed biracial cooperation and noted the achievements of biracial Reconstruction legislatures: establishment of public education in the South for the first time, founding of hospitals, asylums, and charitable institutions to improve general welfare. He said the higher taxes were needed to finance the new infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Kenneth Milton Stampp|author2=Leon F.

==New views of race and slavery==
Beginning in the 1960s, historians writing about slavery, the Civil War and Reconstruction, emphasized the human advancement achieved by the abolition of slavery and the emancipation of those who had been enslaved. Historians such as [[James M. McPherson|James McPherson]] and [[Martin Duberman]] admired the abolitionists and wrote studies of them.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Duberman, ed. ''The Antislavery Vanguard: New Essays on the Abolitionists'' 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Through the later 20th century, such historians as David W. Blight,&lt;ref name=Blight&gt;{{cite book|author=[[David W. Blight]]|title=Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory|year=2001|publisher=Belknap Press; |isbn=0-674-00819-7 |pages=2&amp;ndash;3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Les Benedict,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Michael Les Benedict]]|title=A Compromise of Principle: Congressional Republicans and Reconstruction, 1863-1869|year=1974|publisher=Norton, W. W. &amp; Company, Inc.|isbn=0-393-05524-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; James McPherson, [[John Hope Franklin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Hope Franklin]] with Alfred Moss|title=From Slavery to Freedom. A History of African Americans|edition=8th|location=New York|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|year=2001|isbn=0-07-112058-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steven Hahn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Steven Hahn]]|title=A Nation Under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2004|isbn=0-674-01765-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; marshalled documentation to reject the Dunning School notion that the Reconstruction era was overwhelmingly corrupt. They evaluated the postwar period as not more corrupt than many times of social change and turmoil in American history.

[[John Hope Franklin]]  argued that Reconstruction had positive elements: most significantly, the [[enfranchisement]] of African Americans, both those already free before the war and former slaves; the extension of citizenship and civil rights to four million African Americans; and the introduction of public schools throughout the South where such schools generally had not existed. Franklin, for example, points to the founding of [[Howard University|Howard]] and [[Fisk University|Fisk]], [[historically black colleges and universities|historically black universities]] that educated generations, as two major successes of Reconstruction.

They went far beyond that in looking at slavery in detail, with changes in ideas about relations between masters and enslaved, and the various forms of resistance the latter used. The development of African-American communities, education and political culture has been intensively studied.

Historians argued that depriving African Americans of suffrage and civil rights, as was done in the South following Reconstruction, was itself a terrible form of corruption. They considered it a violation of the tenets of [[representative government]], as African Americans had been effectively excluded from political participation and public life for decades.

In his 1988 book [[Eric Foner]] dated the beginning of Reconstruction in 1863, emphasizing the significance of emancipation and the [[Emancipation Proclamation]]. His title, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'' (1988), emphasized the "unfinished" theme in its subtitle, explicitly connecting Reconstruction to the [[American Revolution]], which had been based on ideas about human liberty and equality. His work suggested that Reconstruction had not completed the work of providing equality and rights to all American citizens, even after constitutional amendments to provide freedmen with citizenship. That work was continuing in the 20th century. His book was published after the civil rights movement gained federal legislation to enforce constitutional rights of suffrage and equal treatment under the law for African Americans and overturn state discrimination. Foner did not identify as a "neoabolitionist" in this work, nor did he refer to other historians by that term.

(April 1952), pp. 613-624&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1964, historian [[George Tindall]] said that in the 1920s, writer [[H. L. Mencken]] was the "guiding genius" behind "the neoabolitionist myth of the Savage South."

Vandiver, ed., ''The Idea of the South: Pursuit of a Central Theme'' (1964), pp 5&amp;ndash;6&lt;/ref&gt;
* In  the early 1960s, says [[Peter Novick]], many historians dedicated to racial equality "were called 'neo-abolitionists'--a not unfriendly characterization, and one which many so-designated embraced."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Novick|title=That Noble Dream: The "Objectivity Question" and the American Historical Profession|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mhiw__MLyVAC&amp;pg=PA351|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge UP|page=351n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[David W. Blight]] wrote in his book, ''Race and Reunion'' (2001):
::In the end this is a story of how the forces of reconciliation overwhelmed the emancipationist vision in the national culture, how the inexorable drive for reunion both used and trumped race. But the story does not merely dead-end in the bleakness of the age of segregation; so much of the emancipationist vision persisted in American culture during the early twentieth century, upheld by blacks and a fledgling neo-abolitionist tradition, that it never died a permanent death on the landscape of Civil War memory. That persistence made the revival of the emancipationist memory of the war and the transformation of American society possible in the last third of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name=Blight /&gt;
* In 2003, the conservative ''[[National Review]]'' commented in 2003 "[t]his general perspective on the sectional conflict is already well represented by the Neoabolitionist school of Early American historians, and informs important works by scholars such as Paul Finkelman, Leonard Richards, Donald Robinson, and William Wiecek."[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1282/is_24_55/ai_n13606723]{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}&lt;!--who wrote the quote?

* Michael Fellman in his 2006 book wrote:

* Zeus Leonardo wrote in 2009 the term had uses beyond historiography, saying, "Neo-abolitionist [[pedagogy]] suggests that teachers and students work together to name, reflect on, and dismantle discourses of [[whiteness]].

*In his 2010 study of 20th-century American literature, David Seed classifies the novel, ''This Child's Gonna Live'' (1969), by Sarah E Wright, as a "neo-abolitionist" novel that "borrows from black nationalist discourse in its bold exploration of the loss of social ground gained in the Reconstruction South."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=David Seed|title=A Companion to Twentieth-Century United States Fiction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4R0B0rSKmxUC&amp;pg=PA86|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 2014, historian Yonatan Eyal argued that starting in the 1950s with Kenneth Stampp "the neo-abolitionist school diametrically flipped the views of the revisionists. It earned moral credibility in doing so, maturing as it did during the upheavals of the 1960s, yet at the same time lost the ability to explain the appeal of Union and compromise as formative influences on America's past." By 2008, Eyal continues: "More Americans identify with the Civil War as a struggle for a 'new birth of freedom,' rather than for the Union, and neo-abolitionist historiography has contributed to that sense over the past several decades."&lt;ref&gt;Yonatan Eyal, "Franklin Pierce, Democratic Partisan ," in [[Joel H.

The '''Piganino''', a [[portmanteau]] of ''pig'' and piano, is a conjectural [[musical instrument]] using a [[keyboard instrument|keyboard]] as to produce [[pitch (music)|sound]] from [[pig]]s by poking them. Satirical use includes further portmanteaus as in {{lang-de|Schweineorgel}} (pig organ), {{lang-fr|l’orgue à cochons}}, and "Hog [[Harmonium]]", (a play on "[[Steinway &amp; Sons|Steinway]]") "Swineway", or (a play on "[[pianoforte]]") "Porko Forte"  in English.

{{Quote|That brutal monarch, Louis XI of France, is said to have constructed, with the assistance of the Abbé de Baigne, an instrument designated a "pig organ," for the production of natural sounds. The master of the royal music, having made a very large and varied assortment of swine, embracing specimens of all breeds and ages, these were carefully ''voiced'', and placed in order, according to their several tones and semitones, and so arranged that a key-board communicated with them, severally and individually, by means of rods ending in sharp spikes. In this way a player, by touching any note, could instantly sound a corresponding note in nature, and was enabled to produce at will either natural melody or harmony! The result is said to have been striking, but not very grateful to human ears.&lt;ref name="Vocal"&gt;Crofts 1885, cf. also Quignard 1996. Cited in Bhagwati, Sandeep (2013).

Beside lack of taste and vocal variety, the tendency to Italianize the names of all things chic and musical was lampooned.&lt;ref&gt;David Tatham: ''The Lure of the Striped Pig: The Illustration of Popular Music in America, 1820–1870.'' Imprint Society, Barre (MS) 1973, {{ISBN|0-87636-051-7}}, S. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoon anticipates the surrealistic machinery of [[Rube Goldberg]]. The 19th century played on various allegations, besides Piganino, further nicknames used for the fictitious instrument were "Hog Harmonium", "Swineway" or "Porko Forte".&lt;ref name="cri"&gt;Mary Babson Fuhrer: ''A Crisis of Community: The Trials and Transformation of a New England Town, 1815–1848.''

{{Quote|Just as understatement of the ludicrous is a standard mode of caricature, so too is overstatement, as we see in this happy example. Burlesquing genteel taste, amateur vocalists, and the vogue for Italianizing the names of all things with musical associations, this cartoon also anticipates the ingenious and surrealistic machines of Rube Goldberg. We may suppose that in more than a few parlors "La Piganino" was slipped onto the music rack as a hint to the vocalist when the evening reached that point at which guests' ears began to droop.&lt;ref&gt;David, Tatham (1973). Quoted at "[http://www.porkopolis.org/pig_artist/piganino/ The Piganino]", ''Porkopolis.org''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The background was a [[commons]]-related conflict: poor farmers tended to let their pigs roam freely, feeding on what the rich did not use, whereas the rich preferred towns and property to be tidily divided.&lt;ref name="cri"/&gt;  The striped pig was used to represent such untidiness in general and drinking men specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teachushistory.org/second-great-awakening-age-reform/resources/death-striped-pig|title=Death on the Striped Pig|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piganino and related cartoons insofar referred to uppity and wannabee neighbors and their porcine conflicts with others.&lt;ref name="cri"/&gt;  In parallel, the ''[[Schweinfurt]]er Anzeiger'' as of 1873 had renewed interest on the French historical origin of the Schweineorgel.&lt;ref&gt;Zwei seltsame Instrumente, Franconia: Unterhaltungsblatt zum "Schweinfurter Anzeiger". Reichardt, 1873&lt;/ref&gt;

== ''Le Libertin'' ==
In the film ''[[The Libertine (2000 film)|Le Libertin]]'' (2000), the philosopher [[Denis Diderot]] is depicted as a screwball eccentric, trying to have his forbidden ''[[Encyclopédie]]'' printed under the eyes of Catholic fanatics. The film is staged in the chateau of a crazy Baron, loosely based on the [[Baron d'Holbach]]. In reality, the Baron d'Holbach was a devoted atheist and important sponsor and contributor to the Encyclopédie. The film shows him as an adversary of Diderot and inventor of a large variety of funny machinery. The noise of a Piganino, one of the inventions, is being used to hide the printing of the forbidden encyclopaedia in the film.&lt;ref&gt;Biographische Fiktionen: das Paradigma Denis Diderot im interkulturellen Vergleich (1765 - 2005), Heidi Denzel de Tirado Königshausen &amp; Neumann, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Further use ==
In German, ''Schweineorgel'' has also been used as a nickname for the [[accordion]] or [[harmonium]], as those instruments were deemed rural and not appropriate for music on academic level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horniger.de/schweineorgel/texte/wasist_d.html|title=Was ist eine SCHWEINEORGEL ?|author=Rainer Siebert|date=1 July 2002|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Das Akkordeon: Schweineorgel oder Avantgarde Instrument? Christina Appert Kantonsschule Wil, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Athanasius Kircher]]'s [[cat organ|Katzenklavier]] uses a similar concept with cats. This sort of caricature was often used when new music styles came around or were adopted in musical realms that had not dealt with them previously. The [[cat organ]], a similar instrument using cats, is used in stories which criticize the cruelty of royalty.

[[Monty Python]]'s "Musical Mice" uses mice instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9nGyPz9uT0 Monty Python - mouse organ sketch] (YouTube). ''Monty Python's Flying Circus'', "Arthur Ewing and His Musical Mice," Season One, Episode Two.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Pratt Ivories''', also known as the '''Acemhöyük''' '''Ivories''', are a collection of furniture attachments produced in Anatolia in the early second millennium B.C. They were donated to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] between 1932 and 1937 by Mr. and Mrs. George D. Pratt. The group represents one of the most important assemblages of furniture fittings from the ancient Near East. In particular, a preserved set of four sphinxes, three lion legs, a falcon, and two recumbent gazelles, comprise the earliest and most complete evidence for a luxury chair or throne from the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=|year=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chain: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence.

== Acquisition and interpretation ==
None of the items gifted in these donations were scientifically excavated. Rather, they were purchased on the art market for the Pratt's extensive personal art collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=|year=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence. Studies Presented to Guenter Kopcke in Honor of His 75th Birthday|location=Philadelphia|publisher=INSTAP Academic Press|volume=|pages=224|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. and Mrs. George D. Pratt subsequently donated the ivory pieces to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in a series of four donations occurring between 1932 and 1937. The fittings were also accompanied by numerous clay sealings, terracotta objects, plates, and figurines.

Two of the ivory sphinxes and a plaque featuring a seated lion were given in the first donation in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimand|first=M.S.|date=1936|title=A Gift of Syrian Ivories|url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=31|issue=11|pages=221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the sphinxes were interpreted as "little ivory stool legs" having been made by a Phoenician or Syrian craftsman for the Assyrian market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winlock|first=H.E.|date=1933|title=Assyria: A New Chapter in the Museum's History of Art|url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=28|issue=2|pages=24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment was largely based on their resemblance to pieces uncovered in excavations of the Assyrian capital, [[Nimrud]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winlock|first=H.E.|date=1933|title=Assyria: A New Chapter in the Museum's History of Art|url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=28|issue=2|pages=24|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This comparison suggests a date of manufacture in the early first millennium B.C.

From 1936 to 1937, following the death of her husband, Mrs. Pratt gave numerous other ivory pieces in three successive groups, eventually contributing sixty-six ivory objects, in addition to the three works donated in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=|year=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence. Studies Presented to Guenter Kopcke in Celebration of His 75th Birthday|publisher=INSTAP Academic Press|publication-place=Philadelphia|volume=|pages=224–25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While these were immediately recognized as furniture attachments and fittings, scholars continued to debate the origin and date of their production. By 1936, M.S. Dimand, a curator in the Museum, challenged the initial assessment of the works, dating them to the end of the second millennium, around the 13th or 12th century B.C., and assigning their production to an "unknown Aramaean art center in Northern Syria." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimand|first=M.S.|date=1936|title=A Gift of Syrian Ivories|url=|journal=The Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin|volume=31|issue=11|pages=222–23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acemhöyük ==
Approximately three decades later, excavations at [[Acemhöyük]] in Turkey provided a conclusive answer to the question of the ivories' date and origin. Led by Nimet Özgüç, digging at the site began in 1962, revealing two monumental buildings dating to the early second millennium B.C. One of these structures, in the south-eastern region of the mound, was termed the Sarikaya palace. It had originally consisted of around fifty rooms before ultimately being destroyed by a large fire. Excavations of its rooms revealed numerous clay bullae, which had been baked by the conflagration. These sealings could be connected to known historical figures, which helped provide a date for the palace in the late 19th and 18th centuries B.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özgüç|first=Nimet|date=1968|title=New Light on the Dating of the Levels of the Karum of Kanish and of Acemhöyük near Aksaray|url=|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|volume=72|pages=319–20|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, excavations revealed other important finds. In room NA-OA/46, located in the western area of the palace, a small group of luxury items were uncovered. This group included several ivory objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özgüç|first=Nimet|date=1966|title=Acemhöyük Kazilari/Excavations at Acemhöyük|url=|journal=Anadolu|volume=10|pages=15–16|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these was a wing, which matched those seen on the Pratt falcon. It would come to be understood that one of the wings presented on the falcon was in fact a replica produced by the museum, and that the Acemhöyük wing in fact belonged to the piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=|year=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence.

Clay bullae matching those in the Pratt collection were also uncovered. Furthermore, later investigations by Machteld Mellink uncovered a photograph from an antiquities dealer in Antakya, which showed of two of the Pratt sphinxes. Reportedly these came from Aksaray, a town near Acemhöyük where items looted from the site were often brought to be sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=|year=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence. Studies Presented to Guenter Kopcke in Celebration of his 75th Birthday.|location=Philadelphia|publisher=INSTAP Academic Press|volume=|pages=227|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of this evidence effectively demonstrated that the assemblage originated at this site,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Özgüç|first=Nimet|date=1966|title=Acemhöyük Kazilari/Excavations at Acemhöyük|url=|journal=Anadolu|volume=10|pages=15–19, 42–45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; having been removed illicitly for sale on the antiquities market. The date and origin of the pieces are now understood to be 19th-18th century B.C. and of Anatolian production.

== Simpson's Ivory Chair Reconstruction ==

=== Form ===
Although the Pratt ivories cannot be fully understood due to the loss of their archaeological context,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence.

Her reconstruction of the work, based on close investigation of the ivories' construction, reveals a chair with legs formed from the sphinxes and lion legs. The sphinxes are the lowest element, touching the floor and supporting the weight of the chair. The lion legs rest on top these, facing forward. The front two sphinxes also face forward, while those forming the back legs face outwards to the sides. The rest of the chair, including the frame, seat, backs, and stretchers, would have been made from fine wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence.

[[File:Reconstruction of the ivory chair from Acemhöyük, Turkey, side view. Drawing by Elizabeth Simpson.jpg|thumb|'''Reconstruction of the ivory chair from Acemhöyük, Turkey, side view. Drawing by Elizabeth Simpson''']]
It is likely that the falcon and gazelle panels, among others, decorated the back of the chair, in accordance with examples seen in Egypt from the 18th Dynasty. Other Pratt panels with rosettes and guilloche motifs may have originally been incorporated into the design of the chair, but unfortunately it is impossible to determine their exact arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence.

=== Color ===
Examination of the ivory pieces also revealed traces of gilding and inlay, indicating that the chair was further embellished with gold, silver, and precious or semi-precious stones. Based on this trace evidence, the sphinxes appear to have had dark, inlaid eyes and were decorated with applied gold and (perhaps) silver leaf. The platforms beneath the lion paws also appear to have been gilded. Traces of silver on the falcon suggest that it too was once covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence.

The color of the sphinxes and lion legs are also frequently commented upon in scholarship of the ivories. Variations in color occur among the pieces (gray, pink, orange, and red), resulting in pieces that match in form but not in color. These disparities are the result of varying conditions (i.e. the level of oxygen) in the fire that destroyed the palace. The ivories were covered with an iron-oxide rich clay slip, which reacted to these particular conditions, resulting in the color changes. Why the ivories were covered in this slip is another question. It is possible that the clay was applied to act as a bole, to assist in the application and burnishing of gold leaf. Simpson notes, however, that the slip occurs on the undersides and backs of the pieces, which would not have been gilded.  Red ivory is also a decorative form attested to in texts of the period, which scholars have interpreted as meaning that ivory was often stained a reddish color. Perhaps in this case, the slip performed two functions, as a bole for applied gilding, and as a colorant for the exposed areas of ivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simpson|first=Elizabeth|date=2013|editor-last=Koehl|editor-first=Robert B.|title=An Early Anatolian Ivory Chair: The Pratt Ivories in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|url=|journal=AMILLA: The Quest for Excellence.

''Rapid serial visual presentation'' is an experimental model frequently used to examine the temporal characteristics of attention. The RSVP paradigm requires participants to look at a continuous presentation of visual items which is around 10 items per second. They are all shown in the same place. The targets are placed inside this stream of continuous items. They are separate from the rest of the items known as distracters. The distracters can either be a color change or it can be letters that are among the numbers.

==Overview==
There is a delay of several hundred milliseconds. A person might be asked to identify numbers in a string of letters which are shown one by one. The first number which is an important target, would be caught by the person, however, the second number flashed seconds later might not be observed. RSVP asks the question, What would reading be like if there were no eye movements? A text is delivered at a spot on the screen, like a series of flash cards. The user can set how long each card is to be displayed. The readers are liberated from having to decide how much time to spend on each word because that is set in advance, and saccades, regressive eye movements, line sweeps, and page turning have been eliminated. A reader can fully concentrate on comprehending the text as it flashes through, however, with longer texts the reading experience is found to be monotonous and exhausting. There are a number of theories to explain how and why this works and studies have explored its limitations and parameters to learn more about visual perception. The brain deals with a quick stream of incoming information at all times. With the attentional blink, the brain has to distribute its attentional resources to comprehend, interpret, and store the information properly. The human brain is capable of processing complex tasks, but it has restrictions. The attentional blink is an illustration that has a significant insinuation for individuals who work in environments where they are usually swamped with information. An example of this is an airport baggage screener who might see a knife in one bag, but misses a second knife in another bag that is right behind the first bag.  The failure to recognize the second target is because of the attentional processes that are linked with the identification of the first target.

==History==

Potter (1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0278-7393.2.5.509| title = Short-term conceptual memory for pictures| journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory| volume = 2| issue = 5| pages = 509–522| year = 1976| last1 = Potter | first1 = M. C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  explored the amount people who are able to comprehend and memorize information from fast series of stimuli. Potter had participants search for the RSVP series of pictures for a specific picture which was the target. This was depicted before the appearance of the RSVP series. Results showed that participants performed well on this task. Here, the RSVP rate was eight items per second; however, participants were still able to accurately find the target on 75% of the trials. Performance was not different in the pictures that were previously presented or described. Each picture was acknowledged within 125 milliseconds. However, Potter &amp; Levy (1969) found that performance did change when participants were assessed on a recognition task for the pictures presented in the RSVP sequence. The results showed that the participants’ performance accurately scored 10% in the task when the RSVP rate was eight items per second.

Sperling and colleagues  examined the RSVP paradigm to investigate the dynamics of shifts of spatial attention (e.g., Reeves &amp; Sperling, 1986; Sperling &amp; Weichselgartner, 1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1037/0033-295X.93.2.180| pmid = 3714927| title = Attention gating in short-term visual memory| journal = Psychological Review| volume = 93| issue = 2| pages = 180–206| year = 1986| last1 = Reeves | first1 = A. | last2 = Sperling | first2 = G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sperling|first=G|author2=Weichselgartner, E. |title=Episodic theory of the dynamics of spatial attention|journal=Psychological Review|year=1995|volume=102|pages=503–522|doi=10.1037/0033-295x.102.3.503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Spatial attention is defined as the ability to center on specific stimuli in a visual environment (Johnson &amp; Proctor, 2004). Sperling used an attention shift procedure in which two RSVP series were presented altogether. There was a central point where one was to the left and the other was to the right of the focus point. One series contained letters and the other series contained numbers. The object of the task was for participants to focus on the letter stream and to report items from the number series following a certain letter. Results showed that participants frequently reported numbers that were heard around 400 milliseconds after the cue. They concluded that the findings were parallel with the time participants were required to shift attention from the series that had the letters to the series that had the numbers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  examined if the same conclusions would be made if the participants had to report items from one RSVP series. Participants had to acknowledge and point out a certain letter and report other items that came after that letter. Results showed participants were more likely to report the items after the letter roughly around 400 milliseconds after the letter was presented. No spatial shift of attention was required. Participants only reported accurately the item following right after the cue but not any other item.

Results showed that following the presence of a target, attentional processing is restricted and people can’t report the items that came after the target, however the presence of the item that comes after the target usually misses attentional blindness. This concludes that when two targets are shown within 500 milliseconds of one another and they are separated by one or more distractors, the second target usually falls within an attentional blink and will not be seen.

[[Inattentional blindness]] as also been looked at as a variation of the rapid serial visual presentation. Rees, Russell, Frith, and Driver (1999)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.286.5449.2504| pmid = 10617465| title = Inattentional Blindness Versus Inattentional Amnesia for Fixated but Ignored Words| journal = Science| volume = 286| issue = 5449| pages = 2504–7| year = 1999| last1 = Rees | first1 = G.| last2 = Russell| first2 = C| last3 = Frith| first3 = C. D.| last4 = Driver| first4 = J}}&lt;/ref&gt;  investigated participants’ brain activity as they looked at rapid displays of a letter string or of a word above a picture. Participants were asked to watch out for repeats in the letter string or in the pictures that were displayed. They found that the attended words in the task were related to semantic processing.

==Modes==

There are two common modes that are used to describe rapid serial visual presentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Robert|title=Rapid Serial Visual Presentation: Design for Cognition|year=2013|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781447150855|author2=Witkowski, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the modes is the static mode. Here, the pictures come into view and then disappear without moving. The other mode, the moving mode is where pictures come into view serially, move about the display and then disappear.

===Static mode===
The pictures in the rapid serial visual presentation have the same entry and exit locations.  Pictures are shown one by one at the same rate. Here, participants must attend to a target that is shown for about 100 milliseconds. This is an advantage of this static mode. A disadvantage of the static mode is that there is no chance after that time to validate what was seen.  The attentional blink which usually lasts between 300-400 milliseconds leads up to the other stimuli not being seen. The static mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: steady gaze, search to steady and visual search.

===Moving modes===
We are usually represented with presentations that rely a great deal on movement of pictures in a 2D plane. These are more difficult to register in comparison than pictures that move back and forth. The basic psychology of human visual perception explains that people are inclined to register imagery in a 3D world. This mode believes rapid serial visual presentation is important when approaching and processing objects. The moving mode can produce three different aspects when looking at an image: diagonal, stream and ring.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==Advantages over conventional reading==
The unique method used by RSVP allows for the reading of unlimited text in a limited position. Researchers from [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]] have found that as many as 12 words per second are readable in controlled situations (720wpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1145/571985.572014| chapter = Web ''Thumb''| title = Proceedings of the 15th annual ACM symposium on User interface software and technology  - UIST '02| pages = 205| year = 2002| last1 = Wobbrock | first1 = J. O. | last2 = Forlizzi | first2 = J. | last3 = Hudson | first3 = S. E. | last4 = Myers | first4 = B. A. | isbn = 1581134886}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Further research has shown that for shorter pieces of text, RSVP formats increased reading speed by 33% with no significant differences in comprehension or task load.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | doi = 10.1007/3-540-45756-9_18| chapter = Towards an Improved Readability on Mobile Devices: Evaluating Adaptive Rapid Serial Visual Presentation| title = Human Computer Interaction with Mobile Devices| volume = 2411| pages = 225| series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science| year = 2002| last1 = Öquist | first1 = G. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = M. | isbn = 978-3-540-44189-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research done by the [[Wichita State University]] suggests that at 250 words per minute (WPM) comprehension was not significantly different from reading done using Palm Reader ([[EReader]]).  Display at 650 WPM reduced comprehension by about 20% versus display at 250 WPM, from a score of 74.6 to 52.1, resulting in an effective 82% increase in words comprehended per minute, assuming the scoring is linear.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071222063502/http://psychology.wichita.edu/surl/usabilitynews/41/rsvp_palm.htm Wichita State]&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that reading rate is determined by size of text and spacing. RSVP allows users to obtain a maximum reading rate through the ability to adjust text size and eliminate space by displaying one item at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D. G.| last2 = Tillman | first2 = K. A.| last3 = Freeman | first3 = J.| last4 = Su | first4 = M.| last5 = Berger | first5 = T. D.| last6 = Majaj | first6 = N. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and limitations==

Several limitations are presented in the rapid serial visual presentation. The RSVP can cause an unnecessary need for cognitive demand. The memory load for each individual differs and can be high, because using RSVP, more attention is needed. Also, RSVP allows us to miss vital information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | pmid = 3672124
| year = 1987
| author1 = Weichselgartner
| first1 = E
| title = Dynamics of automatic and controlled visual attention
| journal = Science
| volume = 238
| issue = 4828
| pages = 778–80
| last2 = Sperling
| first2 = G
 | doi=10.1126/science.3672124
}}&lt;/ref&gt; RSVP also often results with [[repetition blindness]] during use. When presented with a sequence of visual stimuli in rapid succession at the same location, readers often fail to detect words prominently repeated in a series, thus potentially missing the main ideas of the text.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} Other disadvantages include [[attentional blink]], in which the mind focuses longer on certain words which may strike an emotional chord and puts the reader behind in a sequence, {{citation needed|date=February 2013}} as well as [[temporal masking]], causing certain words when being read aloud in a series may evoke a striking sound or response that makes inaudible the mental articulation of the following word.{{citation needed|date=February 2013}}

===Web browsing on small-screen devices===

Using RSVP-based browsers offers a space–time trade-offs for information presentation on small screen devices such as cell phones and PDAs. However to make this solution functional location and context related questions like 'Where am I', 'Where can I usefully go', 'Where have I been' and 'How do I get back to X', need to be addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s007790200024| title = RSVP Browser: Web Browsing on Small Screen Devices| journal = Personal and Ubiquitous Computing| volume = 6| issue = 4| pages = 245–252| year = 2002| last1 = De Bruijn | first1 = O.| last2 = Spence | first2 = R.| last3 = Chong | first3 = M. Y.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
RSVP can aid those with poor eyesight with its one text at a time display that enlarges and highlights the words.

===Peripheral reading===
Peripheral reading is vital to those suffering from [[Central scotoma|central field loss]], which is most commonly seen in the elderly.  Factors which might limit one's peripheral reading rate include acuity, crowding, and eye movements.  Many find difficulty making the correct eye movements for peripheral reading, but the dependence on eye movements can be minimized through the presentation format of RSVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1167/7.2.20| pmid = 18217835| title = Crowding and eccentricity determine reading rate| journal = Journal of Vision| volume = 7| issue = 2| pages = 20.1–36| year = 2007| last1 = Pelli | first1 = D. G.| last2 = Tillman | first2 = K. A.| last3 = Freeman | first3 = J.| last4 = Su | first4 = M.| last5 = Berger | first5 = T. D.| last6 = Majaj | first6 = N. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Adolescent sexual offenders===
Limited existing previous research by Beech et al. suggests that images presented in RSVP have the potential to elicit a response from adolescent sexual offenders by measuring the effects of attentional blink.  A stronger attentional blink is expected among adolescent sexual offenders after viewing a series of child related images.  However, this hypothesis has not held up to subsequent research and remains an area of continued debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1177/1079063208328677| title = Applying Rapid Serial Visual Presentation to Adolescent Sexual Offenders: Attentional Bias as a Measure of Deviant Sexual Interest?| journal = Sexual Abuse: A Journal of Research and Treatment| volume = 21| issue = 2| pages = 135–148| year = 2009| last1 = Crooks | first1 = V.

The campaign, which usually aired one at the end of a special primetime program, was famous for its opening title sequence, which originally showed a live action TV set which zoomed in using [[stop motion]] that used pages on the side flipping into either the celebrity of the program aired or just on-screen graphics, which was remade in 1990 using [[computer animation]] that used [[computer-generated imagery|CGI]] for the pages on the side of the TV flipping to revolve to the celebrity/graphics. The spiel in each PSA talks about learning more about what happened in the program, the books the Library of Congress suggests, and that they can be found in their local library or [[bookstore]]. It ended with either the celebrity of the program or an announcer saying, "Visit them. They'll be happy to help you ''Read More About It''." 

Originally the theme music was composed by [[Keith Mansfield]], but in 1983, "Moments of Courage" by composer [[Craig Palmer]] became the theme for the PSAs.  Along with a remade intro came a new theme for the campaign which lasted for the 1990s.  With the arrival of the internet came new resources to learn about the subject of the special or movie aired on CBS and other networks.  Because of this, ''Read More About It'' was succeeded at the turn of the 21st century by the ''[[CBS Cares]]'' campaign, which like its predecessor usually airs at the end of either a movie (example: ''[[The Karen Carpenter Story]]'') (until 2010) or a special program (example: The [[Grammy Awards]] or the [[Super Bowl]]) and focuses primarily on resources, online and print, to learn about the event or subject featured in the preceding program or community involvement.

The '''Returned Treasures Program''' of the INAH Directorate of Global Patrimony or Dirección de Patrimonio Mundial [http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/mener/index.php?contentPagina=14] operates under the Government of Mexico’s INAH, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia) and INAH’s National Museum of Anthropology (Museo Nacional de Antropología). See, INAH-MNA Journal of Latin American Anthropology and History at J L Am Anthro History 1989 Apr 15; 32-35.

==Creation==
As part of the INAH Dirección de Patrimonio Mundial [http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/mener/index.php?contentPagina=14], the Returned Treasures Program was established January 1989 as an INAH cultural trust ([[:es:Fideicomiso|fideicomiso]]) created by an international group of philanthropists, curators, and art historians and patrons for the purpose of finding and purchasing Latin American cultural property located in foreign countries other than the Latin American country of origin. The trust oversees the repatriation or rendition of such works back to Mexico and other Latin countries of origin for the cataloging, preserving, protecting, and studying of important cultural property. J L Am Anthro History 1989 Apr 15; 39-42.

==Purpose==
The primary purpose of the program and trust is to return important and priceless Latin American cultural property back to Mexico and other Latin America countries of origin. The works range from (1) pre-Columbian pottery and stone works of Meso-American (Mexico and Central America) and other cultures, including the South American Inca and pre-Inca cultures of Peru, Ecuador, Chile, and Bolivia to (2) colonial cultural works produced during and after the Spanish Conquest (including codex and other early printed works) to (3) Independence, Porfiriato, and Revolutionary Eras from 1810 to 1920 to (4) modern cultural property produced from 1920 to 1968 (including art by Saturnino Herran, Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, José Clemente Orozco, and Rufino Tamayo). J L Am Anthro History 1989 Apr 15; 39-42.

==Major Donors and Contributors==
The INAH Directorate of Global Patrimony or Dirección de Patrimonio Mundial [http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/mener/index.php?contentPagina=14] works with foreign art patrons and philanthropists to fund the return of important cultural works to Mexico and other Latin American countries of origin. Initially, the Returned Treasures Program of the INAH Directorate of Global Patrimony or Dirección de Patrimonio Mundial [http://www.gobiernodigital.inah.gob.mx/mener/index.php?contentPagina=14] was created to return specific works selected by the Directorate as important and in need of foreign funding Support. Accordingly, the Directorate first relied on funding from Hispanic art patrons in California and Texas, including Texas attorney Ernest M. Edsel (of Malpaso Company, a Wall Street oil &amp; gas investment fund), who donated important works (Diego Rivera lithographs; correspondence of Sor Juana Ines; and, pre-Columbian idols, pottery, and stone works) along with an initial $4 million gift from Malpaso Oil. J L Am Anthro History 1989 Apr 15; 39 and "''Entrevista con El Inversionista Ernest Edsel''", Agenda Cultural del INAH (Noviembre 1989) (official INAH monthly magazine). Ernest Edsel also raised substantial funds from fellow Texas investors J. Richard Miller, a Texas financier (founder of Miller Martin, an investment bank and financial [factoring] firm) and Louis E.S. de Santamaria, a venture capitalist and former Revlon and Johnson &amp; Johnson senior executive (co-founder of SPE Ventures, affiliated with First Security SBIC, now part of Wells Fargo). Other donors and contributors included [[Paul Bilzerian]] (founder of Bicoastal Financial Corporation) and, Sir James Goldsmith (major Mexican landowner). J L Am Anthro History 1989 Apr 15; 39-42; and see, INAH Press Release (December 12, 1988).

==Returned Treasures==
From 1998 to 2008, the Returned Treasures Program returned major cultural properties back to their countries of origin, as follows: five stelae of the classic Maya kingdom of Copán, from French and Swiss private collectors to Mexico; one frozen high altitude Inca mummy with funerary articles, from Spanish private collector to Peru; six "tumis", ceremonial knives, of pre-Inca Sican culture, from Canadian private collector to Peru; two Aztec codices, from U.S. private collector to Mexico; correspondence, forty-five sketches, and five small oil studies of José María Velasco, from British private collector to Mexico; correspondence and seven oils of Geraldo Murillo, from Japanese private collector to Mexico; and, correspondence and nineteen sketches of Juan O'Gorman. J L Am Anthro History 2008 Sept 15; 76-142.

The Returned Treasures Program helps prevent the destruction of a country's [[cultural heritage]]. And, the program's restitution efforts helps solve the theft of important cultural property that arises from the [[Illicit antiquities|illicit trade of antiquities]].

A partial list of the important cultural property acquired by the Returned Treasures Program and rendered back to Mexico and other Latin American countries of origin can be found at an online supplement weblog to the Journal of the Mexico National Museum of Anthropology (Museo Nacional de Antropología) and INAH, the National Institute of Anthropology and History (Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia).

==Endowed Cultural Trust==
The Journal (also known as the INAH-MNA Journal of Latin American Anthropology and History) is published twice a year by the Council for Latin American Anthropology and History, a section of the Latin American Anthropological and Historical Association.

The Journal publishes articles, commentary, review articles, exhibition and book reviews, and research notes relevant to museum anthropology and the study of material culture. The Journal also publishes art catalogues for selected exhibitions.

The Journal is funded by an endowment from an INAH-MNA cultural trust (fideicomiso) established in 1989 by an international group of philanthropists, art historians, and curators for the purpose of finding and purchasing Latin American cultural property located in foreign countries other than the Latin American country of origin. The trust oversees the repatriation or rendition of such works back to Mexico and other Latin countries of origin for the cataloging, preserving, protecting, and studying of important cultural property.

The '''Saint Louis Science Center''', founded as a planetarium in 1963, is a collection of buildings including a [[science museum]] and [[planetarium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], on the southeastern corner of [[Forest Park (St. Louis, Missouri)|Forest Park]]. With over 750 exhibits in a complex of over {{convert|300000|sqft|sqm}}, it is among the largest of its type in the United States.&lt;ref name=scala&gt;{{cite book|title=Forest Park, Saint Louis|author=Craske, Oliver|author2=Peacock, Sarah|author3=Shoolbred, Andrew|publisher=Scala Publishers|isbn=978-1-85759-340-2|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=March 2018}}

[[File:McDonnellPlanetarium.jpg|thumb|320px|The James S. McDonnell Planetarium, built in 1963 and featuring a [[thin-shell structure|thin-shell]] and [[hyperboloid structure]] by [[Gyo Obata]]. This building is one of the most distinctive components of the Saint Louis Science Center campus]]
Funding for the first structure of the current campus began in 1955, with $1 million of a $110 million city bond issue specified for the construction of a planetarium. Two years were spent surveying locations. The first proposed site, on the northern side of Forest Park near the [[Missouri History Museum|Jefferson Memorial Building]] at Lindell and DeBaliviere, was scrapped because of restrictions on subdivisions. The location was changed to the southern part of the park, on the site of the old [[mounted police]] station, which was demolished in 1960. The plan was to build a planetarium, science museum, and natural history museum.&lt;ref name=fp/&gt;

The Planetarium was designed by [[Gyo Obata]] of [[Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum]] with a unique shape (Obata was later tasked in the 1970s with designing the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]]'s [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]). ''[[Architectural Forum]]'' magazine described it as, "Looking like some strange craft spun down to earth from outer space... St. Louis's new planetarium perches gracefully on a rise in ... Forest Park".&lt;ref name=fp/&gt; [[James Smith McDonnell]] (1899&amp;ndash;1980), an aviation pioneer and co-founder of St. Louis-based [[McDonnell Douglas]], an [[aerospace manufacturer]], donated $200,000 for equipment such as the star projector. The facility was named after him in 1964.&lt;ref name=fp&gt;{{cite book|date=1986|isbn=0-9638298-0-7|author=Loughlin, Caroline|author2=Anderson, Catherine|title=Forest Park|publisher=[[University of Missouri Press]]|location=[[Columbia, Missouri]]|page=207&amp;ndash;209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, 1997, an air-supported building was added to the main building, the Exploradome. With an additional {{convert|18000|sqft|sqm}}, it was intended as a temporary facility for traveling exhibitions, additional classrooms, and to host large group events.

The '''Scottish Ministerial Code''' applies to members of the [[Scottish Government]] (the First Minister, Cabinet Secretaries and Law Officers) and junior Scottish Ministers. The guidance is issued by the [[First Minister of Scotland|First Minister]] and is a collection of standards around expected behaviours and responsibilities. Since 2008 there has been a mechanism for an independent review of any suspected breaches of the code.

==History==
Drafting of the new Scottish Ministerial Code was discussed at the first meeting of the Cabinet on 20 May 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/heritage/people-places/donald-dewar-s-cabinet-minutes-unveiled-1-3648391 |title=Donald Dewar's cabinet minutes unveiled |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=31 December 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was based on a [[Ministerial Code|code]] used in [[Government of the United Kingdom|Whitehall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/opinion/jim-gallagher-time-to-crack-the-scottish-ministerial-code-1-2733388 |title=Time to crack the Scottish Ministerial Code |first=Jim |last= Gallagher |authorlink=Jim Gallagher (civil servant) |work=The Scotsman |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first version was issued in August 1999.

The 2008 version introduced changes that specifically prohibited ministers from making misleading statements in the Parliament chamber.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/outside-scrutiny-needed-to-keep-ministers-on-best-behaviour-1-1264050 |title=Outside scrutiny needed to keep ministers on best behaviour |first=Patrick |last=Harvie |authorlink=Patrick Harvie |work=The Scotsman |date=23 June 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 changes were made to allow Ministers to confirm whether they have received legal advice on a specific topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13412794.SNP_Government_changes_ethics_code_without_input_from_MSPs/ |title=SNP Government changes ethics code without input from MSPs |first=Paul |last=Hutcheon |work=[[The Sunday Herald]] |date=14 June 2015 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ministerial parliamentary aides were originally not able to sit on committees that provided scrutiny of their Minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/ian-swanson-scottish-politics-1-943845 |title=Scottish Politics |first=Ian |last=Swanson |work=The Scotsman |date=28 February 2002 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This positions became known as Parliamentary Liaison Officers (PLOs) and the restriction was removed in 2007. In August 2016&lt;ref name="Herald 8Dec2016"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14952675.Sturgeon_to_toughen_Ministerial_Code_on_Holyrood_aides/ |title=First Minister Nicola Sturgeon to toughen Ministerial Code on Holyrood aides |first=Tom |last=Gordon |work=[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]] |location=Glasgow |date=8 December 2016 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A requirement was introduced for PLOs to declare this on the first occasion that they took part in parliamentary business within the remit of their Cabinet Secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.holyrood.com/articles/news/scottish-government-removes-ministerial-aides-committees-after-conflict-interest |title=Scottish Government removes ministerial aides from committees after 'conflict of interest' pressure |first=Tom |last=Freeman |work=[[Holyrood (magazine)|Holyrood]] |date=31 August 2016 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By December this had been tightened up to extend to every occasion.&lt;ref name="Herald 8Dec2016"/&gt;

The February 2018 version contained new sections to guard against harassment, bullying and other such inappropriate behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.commonspace.scot/articles/12318/scottish-ministerial-code-updated-clamp-down-harassment |title=Scottish ministerial code updated to clamp down on harassment |first=Caitlin |last=Logan |work=[[CommonSpace]] |date=9 February 2018 |accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scrutiny==
In 2008 an independent Panel was created to review any concerns, with former Presiding Officers Lord [[David Steel]] and [[George Reid (Scottish politician)|George Reid]] appointed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-14527259 |title=Lord Steel quits standards role over Supreme Court row |work=[[BBC News]] |date=15 August 2011 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steel and Reid left their positions in mid-2011. Following this [[Peter Fraser, Baron Fraser of Carmyllie|Lord Peter Fraser]] and [[Dame Elish Angiolini]] were appointed. [[David Bell (university administrator)|David Bell]] was appointed in October 2012, then in 2013 [[James Hamilton (Director of Public Prosecutions)|James Hamilton]], a former Director of Public Prosecutions on Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/13090578.Ministerial_code_role_for_ex_prosecutor/ |title=Ministerial code role for ex-prosecutor |work=The Herald |date=2 February 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexuality]] in [[music video]]s has been evident since the 1980s.  The extent in which stereotypes align with gender portrayal varies each decade.  Music video content has remained culturally relevant and subliminally influential on adolescent character development.  In addition, the intersectionality between race and gender is evident throughout music video history.  By analyzing the correlation between music video material and gender representation, conclusions can be drawn pertaining to how music television impacts young adults' perception of their appropriate societal behavior.

==1980s==
On August 1, 1981, the first 24-hour music video channel aired.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Seidman | first1 = S. A. | year = 1992 | title = Profile: An investigation of sex‐role stereotyping in music videos | url = | journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 209–216 | doi=10.1080/08838159209364168}}&lt;/ref&gt; Directed towards adolescents, [[MTV]] promoted societal trends through video content and advertisements. The material displayed helped the audience identify appropriate male and female roles, behaviors, and careers.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In the 1980s, typical feminine stereotypes included: submissive, performed household duties, emotional.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;Vincent, R. C., Davis, D. K., &amp; Boruszkowski, L. A. (1987). Sexism on MTV: The portrayal of women in rock videos. Journalism Quarterly, 64(4), 750-941.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contrastingly, common male clichés were as follows: dominant, professional occupations, aggressive.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Young adults mainly watched MTV because it was different from other programs, they were intrigued by the unification of visuals and music, and used it as "leisure time entertainment".&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sun | first1 = S. W. | last2 = Lull | first2 = J. | year = 1986 | title = The adolescent audience for music videos and why they watch | url = | journal = Journal of Communication | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 115–125 | doi=10.1111/j.1460-2466.1986.tb03043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rolling Stones]], [[AC/DC]], [[Michael Jackson]], and [[Guns N' Roses]] were leading significant figures, displayed on MTV.  Music Television had a commanding influence on its audience and heavily effected the ways adolescents viewed their societal role.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

Music videos, released in the 1980s, typically depicted women as alluring objects.  Aligning with typical stereotypes, women were portrayed as attractive, yet submissive.  Although women's talents may be acknowledged, their skill never surpassed the male's—this concept is evident in AC/DC's video for "[[Sink the Pink]]".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;  In the Rock n' Roll video, one of the main characters is a self-assured woman, who is a skillful pool player; the woman utilizes her talent and sexuality as an attention getter, but is not shown as more talented than the male characters.

In a study, conducted in 1987, thirty hours of MTV content was analyzed.  The research performed helped draw further conclusions, regarding sexuality in 1980s music videos.  The results suggested: 57% of music videos displayed women being objectified, 17% showed women's talents being accounted for, yet her sexual role was highlighted, 14% did not align with typical stereotypes, 12% acknowledged women's independence.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; In addition to these results, touching was displayed in over 50% of music videos and females were frequently seen in seductive clothing.&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt;

==1990s==
Music remained an essential part of the cultural evolution of the 1990s. The music scene transitioned into the darker and more provocative sounds of the genres of [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[hip-hop]], and [[R&amp;B]]. Popular music videos of the time came from artists such as [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Notorious B.I.G.]], [[Aaliyah]], [[Weezer]], and [[RadioHead]]. While the acclaimed artists and genres of the times differed form the previous decade, the visual depictions of this music and how they were delivered to the public remained the same. MTV remained socially relevant in constructing images to correlate to music, helping propel youth culture into the atmosphere of visual experiences. As music videos grew in popularity and cultural prominence, researchers became continually fascinated by the link between gender identities and mass media platforms. Several studies have been conducted regarding gender portrayals in music videos of the 1990s.

In early 1990, MTV created a Program Standards Department which aimed to reject music videos featuring extremely graphic and explicit content. The program sought to prohibit any signs of female nudity and violence directed toward female figures. For example, MTV rejected [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna's]] "[[Justify My Love#Music video|Justify my Love]]" video due to its explicit content. After this program was implemented, a study was conducted to analyze the centrality and depiction of women in the most 100 popular videos of the decade. The study first sorted men and women in the categories of either leading or supporting figures in the videos, discovering that men outnumbered women in lead roles by an astronomical 5 to 1 margin.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Gow, J. (1996). Reconsidering gender roles on MTV: Depictions in the most popular music videos of the early 1990s. Communication reports, 9(2), 151-161.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, the study categorized the lead roles into seven main portrayals (artist, poser, comic, actress, superhuman, dancer, or crowd pleaser). The analysis found that a majority of women in lead roles were portrayed as either posers (35%) or dancers (29%) while men in lead roles were more equally disbursed amongst the seven categories.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Portraying women predominately as dancers or posers implied that, in the 90s, women needed not to display musical talent, but instead physical talent that emphasized a sexual attitude. Meanwhile, the equal disbursement of men amongst the categories suggested that men could better exhibit skills of musical and performing prowess.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt;

Other studies analyzed 123 music videos from varying genres that aired in the summer of 1995. 44.7% of the videos failed to feature a female in a central role, while 31.7% of the videos portrayed women as conventional, meaning that they served as either objects or sensory props to romantic male desire.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, S. (1999). The gender role paradox in youth culture: An analysis of women in music videos. Michigan Sociological Review, 46-64.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the overt sexual nature of women in these videos was not the only thing analyzed. Gender displays in the form of nonverbal sexual cues were also considered, proving that women could also be depicted more subliminally sexual than men. For example, in the videos only 1.24% of men touched their hair compared to 38.35% of females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wallis | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = Performing gender: A content analysis of gender display in music videos | url = | journal = Sex Roles | volume = 64 | issue = 3–4| pages = 160–172 | doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9814-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, only .74% of males danced suggestively in their videos compared to 26.80% of females. The study examines the distinction between the prominence and depiction of male and female gender portrayals within the music videos of the 1990s.

==2000s==
[[File:Womanizer Miami.jpg|thumb|Singer [[Britney Spears]] performs in [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears|The Circus tour]] in Miami, 2009]]

Music remained integral to cultural life in the 2000s, while not many new genres were created during this time other than a few indie-related and electronic genres. Teen Pop carried a heavy influence over from the 90s into the first part of the decade. Artists such as Britney spears Christina Aguilera, NSYNC and Backstreet Boys. By the mid 2000s Contemporary R&amp;B had become the most popular genre with artists such as Usher at the forefront.

A study conducted by Jacob Turner in 2008, hypothesized that African American genres of music (hip-hop, rhythm, and blues) would feature the most sexual content in their music videos while White genres (Country and Rock) would feature less. The study found that 73% of all music videos had some sort of sexual content. Further, the study found that 90.09% of mixed Hip-Hop and R&amp;B music videos contained sexual content. Followed by Hip-Hop with 79.7%, R&amp;B with 76.9%. The genres that contained the least amount of sexual content on their music videos were rock with 40.0% and Country with 37.0%. The study also looked into how African American and White wallpaper characters were dressed in music videos. It found that African American wallpaper characters were three times more likely to dress provocatively than White wallpaper characters.The study also found that while African Americans were not underrepresented in music videos. However, the study proposes that this is because videos featuring African Americans featured significantly more sexual content than videos that featured Whites.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Jacob. "Hegemony, Hedonism, and Hip-Hop: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos." Conference Papers -- International Communication Association, 2008 Annual Meeting, pp. 1-26.

==2010s==
Into the 2010s, artists have continued to garner headlines for provocative content in music videos. For example, [[Rihanna|Rihanna's]] music video for the song "[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]", in which she simulates sex with a life-sized doll and wears [[Bondage (BDSM)|bondage]] gear, generated much media attention and was banned in 11 countries. [[YouTube]] required its users to verify they were 18 years of age before being able to view the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1657144/rihanna-s-m-video-banned/|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Video Restricted By YouTube, Banned In 11 Countries|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The director of the video, [[Melina Matsoukas]], responded to the controversy by saying she felt the video was a success because the provocative imagery creating a dialogue around the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1657250/rihannas-sm-video-director-responds-to-controversy/|title=Rihanna's 'S&amp;M' Video Director Responds To Controversy|work=MTV News|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Ariana Grande's "[[Everyday (Ariana Grande song)|Everyday]]" video depicts several couples beginning to have sex in various public places, such as on the bus, was praised for its [[sex positivity]] and inclusion of different races and sexual orientations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/211571_ariana_grande_super_racy_everyday_video_will_totally_make_you_blush|title=Ariana Grande's Super Racy 'Everyday' Video Will Totally Make You Blush|work=Entertainment Tonight|access-date=2017-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research has looked into the effects that music videos that sexually objectify women have on women's body image perceptions. A study of college students found that young women were more likely to view their body in a negative light after exposure to a sexually-objectifying music video, particularly in women with low self-esteem. The same study found that exposure to sexually objectifying music videos lessened the extremity of young women's conception of an [[ideal body weight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mischner|first=Isabelle|date=January 2013|title=Thinking Big: The Effect of Sexually Objectifying Music Videos  on Bodily Self-Perception in Young Women|url=|journal=Body Image|volume=10|pages=26–34|via=|doi=10.1016/j.bodyim.2012.08.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 study found a relationship between sexual content in dance music videos and negative attitudes toward sex and sexuality among young adults in the United States and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wright , Rubin |first=Chrysalis , Mark |date=2017|title="Get lucky! Sexual content in music lyrics, videos, and social media and sexual cognitions and risk among emerging adults in the USA and Australia"|url=|journal=Sex Education|volume=17|pages=41–56|via=|doi=10.1080/14681811.2016.1242402}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars have noted that sexualized content in music videos rarely depicts non-heterosexuality. Frederik Dhaenens has pointed out that when music videos to feature gay content, it is oftentimes involves a "heteronormative shaping of gay and lesbian identities", citing [[Macklemore]] and [[Ryan Lewis]]' "[[Same Love]]" as an example.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dhaenens|first=Frederik|date=2016|title=Reading Gay Music Videos: An Inquiry Into the Representation of Sexual Diversity in Contemporary Popular Music Videos|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03007766.2015.1068530|journal=Popular Music and Society|volume=39|pages=532–546|via=|doi=10.1080/03007766.2015.1068530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions of race==
Studies have shown that music videos featuring African American characters tend to feature significantly more depictions of sexual acts than videos featuring white characters.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robillard|first=Alyssa|date=2012|title=Music Videos and Sexual Risk in African American Adolescent Girls|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224|journal=American Journal of Health Education|volume=43|pages=93–103|via=|doi=10.1080/19325037.2012.10599224}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, African American women are the most likely group of people to be depicted as engaging in sexual behaviors and wearing provocative clothing. A study in the American Journal of Health Education attributed music videos' "frank sexual messages, objectification, and overtly sexual images" to an apathy toward these behaviors in African American girls, which the journal considered dangerous in light of the heightened HIV risk for African Americans.&lt;ref name="auto4"/&gt; It has been suggested by scholar Jacob Turner that white-run corporations like [[Viacom]] (which owns MTV) are more willingly to pay for music videos from African American artists that perpetuate racial and sexual stereotypes as an explanation for why African Americans videos are disproportionately sexualized compared to white videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=Jacob|date=2011|title=Sex and the Spectacle of Music Videos: An Examination of the Portrayal of Race and Sexuality in Music Videos|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=ef2d260b-1308-4780-8e09-2b5d3a5a7abd%40sessionmgr4008|journal=Sex Roles|volume=64|pages=173–191|via=|doi=10.1007/s11199-010-9766-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asian artists, such as [[BoA]], have been accused of presenting Western stereotypes of Asian female sexuality in their music videos as an attempt to gain popularity in the United States. [[Japan]]'s [[Koda Kumi]] and [[AKB48]] also presents sexuality in their music videos. Male [[K-pop]] star [[Rain (entertainer)|Rain's]] music video for his song "[[Rainism]]" has been credited with helping to refute [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States#Emasculation and asexuality|stereotypes of Asian men as effeminate and weak]] depicting an Asian man in various sexual situations, primarily with white women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jung|first=Eun-Young|date=2010|title=Playing the Race and Sexuality Cards in the Transnational Pop Game: Korean Music Videos for the USA Market|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com/eds/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=6&amp;sid=75ed386c-7ceb-4035-884c-0b80240c7d53%40sessionmgr4007|journal=Journal of Popular Music Studies|volume=22|pages=219–236|via=|doi=10.1111/j.1533-1598.2010.01237.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sultanganj Buddha''' is a [[Gupta Empire|Gupta]]-[[Pala Empire|Pala]] transitional period sculpture, the largest substantially complete copper Buddha figure known from the time. The statue is dated by archaeologists to between 500 and 700 AD. It is 2.3 m high and 1 m wide and weighs over 500&amp;nbsp;kg. It was found in the [[North India]]n town of [[Sultanganj]], [[Bhagalpur district]], [[Bihar]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/content/articles/2006/05/10/sultanganj_buddha_feature.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; in 1861 during the construction  of the [[East Indian Railway]].&lt;ref name="Wingfield"&gt;Wingfield, Christopher (2010) Touching the Buddha: Encounters with a charismatic object. In Museum Materialities: Objects, Engagements, Interpretations, ed. Sandra H. Dudley, Routledge: London &amp; New York, pp.53-70. http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780415492188/&lt;/ref&gt; It is now held by [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]].

==Description==
The Sultanganj Buddha was cast in pure, unrefined copper by the ''cire perdue'', or [[list-wax casting|lost wax]], technique. It stands with his right hand raised in ''[[abhayamudra]]'' (a gesture of reassurance or protection), and his left hand is held downwards with palm outwards, said to indicate granting a favour. The end of the monastic robe is held between the thumb and forefinger of this hand in the manner that is still practised by [[Theravada|Theravadin]] monks.

==Discovery and later history==
[[File:Sultanganj Buddha found.jpg|thumb|EB Harris with the Sultanganj Buddha. 1861/1862]]
[[File:Sultanganj Buddha.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Stone statue of Buddha from Sultanganj in the [[British Museum]] Lotus petals inscribed with "[[Ye Dharma Hetu]]" mantra]]
E. B. Harris, the railway engineer who discovered the Buddha during excavations that he carried out on ancient remains near the Sultanganj station that he was constructing, published a detailed account of his work, complete with a site plan and photographs. He describes finding the right foot of the Buddha ten feet under the surface, beneath a floor he considered to have been used to conceal the statue after it had been toppled from its former place.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, E. B. (1864) Description of Buddhist Remains Discovered at Sooltangunge, London: privately published.&lt;/ref&gt; Harris sent the statue to Birmingham, the cost of its transport to England being paid by Samuel Thornton, a Birmingham manufacturer of ironmongery. Thornton, himself a former mayor of Birmingham, offered it to the [[Birmingham City Council|Borough Council]] for their proposed Art Museum in 1864. In Birmingham, a town that boasted a thousand trades, the Art Museum was intended to be an exemplar and inspiration for local metalworkers and other artisans.

Over the years, it has been shown in a number of prominent locations throughout [[Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery]] (BMAG) and remains an indispensable display item. It was the foundation donation to the collections and is BMAG's most treasured possession.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmagic.org.uk/objects/1885A1116&lt;/ref&gt; Harris's report shows him with the Buddha and a number of smaller finds. They included two much smaller standing Buddhas in stone: one is now in the [[British Museum]] and the other in the [[Asian Art Museum of San Francisco]]. A stone Buddha head, also from Sultanganj, is now in the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=5098&amp;partId=1&amp;place=39987&amp;plaA=39987-2-11&amp;page=1 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchcollection.asianart.org/view/objects/asitem/id/19594 Asian Art Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://collections.vam.ac.uk/item/O64237/head-of-the-buddha-sculpture-unknown/ Victoria and Albert Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current location==
From 1998 to 2015, the Buddha was the centrepiece of a gallery at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery dedicated to displaying a number of Buddhas and related artefacts, and Birmingham Museum held an annual 'Buddha Day', when West Midlands-based Buddhist groups from a range of traditions would bless the statue.

During 2015, Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery worked with representatives of a number of faith groups from the city on the creation of a new 'Faith Gallery', and the Sultanganj Buddha was moved from its previous location. It is now displayed in a new gallery that tells the story of the range of faiths that are practiced in Birmingham.

'''Translation''' as a [[rhetorical device]] is a form of [[parody]], where a [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] [[paraphrase]] of a source quotation is given to mock its author; to enhance the [[irony]], it is furthermore stated that the version being given is merely a translation into the speaker's language, implying that the original speaker was unduly obscure or [[Monologue|ranting]]. Given the nature of [[Usenet]] forums, parodic translation is prevalent in [[flame wars]], where remarks such as "Translation: 'I do not have a clue and am throwing mud'" are used to imply &amp;mdash; on very little ground &amp;mdash; that another poster is not making any appreciable contribution to the subject.

Unlike other forms of parody, translation has a relatively recent history; early usages of the device can be seen in the work of the Viennese literary critic and journalist [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]],  who claimed to translate from other journalists' &amp;mdash; famously former friend [[Maximilian Harden|Harden]] &amp;mdash; and from ''Moskauderwelch'' &amp;mdash; a derisive term for the highly elaborate [[Marxist]] [[jargon]] of the time, a pun on ''Moskau'', Moscow, and ''Kauderwelch'', gibberish. Kraus' influence is notable in [[Karl Popper]]; while translation of scientific theories into [[principle of verification|verificationist]] terms had been a standard procedure in [[logical positivism]] for some time, Popper's criticism of several philosophers and scientists that failed to comply with his notion of the [[scientific method]] took a mocking quality reminiscent of the former.

The '''Triad''' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.triadcentral.org Triad Resource Center]&lt;/ref&gt; is an approach by the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to decision-making for [[Hazardous waste|hazardous-waste]] [[waste dump|site]] cleanup.&lt;ref&gt;pp.91-111, Crumbling, Griffith, Powell&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1990s, technology advocates from the environmental sector in the United States developed the approach by combining innovations in management and technology with ideas from hazardous-waste site cleanup experience.

Their goal was to form a framework for real-time [[environmental sensor]]s and tools, to improve decision-making at contaminated sites. This resulted in a more formalized set of ideas in [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html 2001] that soon became known as the Triad approach. The ideas spawned a [[Community of practice|Community of Practice]] by 2005.

The Triad Community of Practice&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/user/cop/&lt;/ref&gt; includes representatives of federal, state, and private sector organizations in the U.S. and abroad. By 2008, a European CoP had been formed &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cysense.com/index.asp?pageID=133 European CoP Info]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a technical conference led largely by the CoP and covering the Triad Approach was held at the University of Massachusetts in Amherst, "Triad Investigations: New Approaches and Innovative Strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html 2008 Triad Conference] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110314225529/http://www.umass.edu/tei/conferences/platforms.html |date=2011-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;"

The term Triad represents three elements: systematic project planning (SPP), dynamic work strategies, and innovative rapid sampling and analytical technologies. While elements of the Triad have long been used for site cleanup, Triad packages these [[best practices|best management practices]] together with the guiding principles:

# Use a planning process, which includes participation of all stakeholders (including a multidisciplinary project team, federal and state regulators, legal counsel, community members, and other environmental professionals), to determine the types of data required and to evaluate whether the site could benefit from real-time measurement technologies.
# Discussion of uncertainty management, data representativeness, and site closure strategies.
# Use of a site model that recognizes site characterization is an element used at all stages of remediation.   
# Use of sampling, measurement, and data management technologies to support [http://pubs.acs.org/cgi-bin/article.cgi/esthag-a/0000/35/i19/html/19crumbling.html uncertainty management strategies].  
# Project teams that have communication, trust, discussion of individual interests and goals, and expertise in the appropriate fields.

Triad is an open-marketplace idea that is not owned by one entity. There is considerable U.S. Multiagency support for Triad.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/multiagency/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2006, The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Office of Superfund Remediation and Technology Innovation expressed support of Triad by requesting the cooperation of its regional managers to expand the use of Triad at Superfund sites, where appropriate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/Triad_Policy_Memo.pdf EPA Memo OSWER-9200.1-55&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elements of the Triad==
Although the following elements are the legs that gave the impetus for calling the process "Triad," the goal of the Triad approach is to infuse the concepts into hazardous-waste site cleanups, no matter what the lead organization calls the process. (U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Technical Project Planning Process (TPP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715135918/http://www.usace.army.mil/publications/eng-manuals/em200-1-2/entire.pdf |archivedate=2007-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for systematic planning, for example.)

===Systematic Project Planning===
Project planning identifies the problems and encourages stakeholders to negotiate the steps necessary to mediate the risks the environmental contamination pose to human health and ecology. The specific goals of a project (redevelopment, revitalization, etc.) may differ, but the specific objectives during the SPP process are:

*Frame the problem: identify project objectives, constraints, stakeholders, the regulatory framework, and primary/secondary decisions.
*Develop a site model: construct and maintain a site model that captures information pertinent to the primary/secondary decisions that must be made. The term CSM is updated by identifying data gaps, and developing a dynamic work strategy to fill in the data gaps.
*Evaluate and manage uncertainty: evaluate and manage the uncertainty associated with decision-making in the context of the CSM so that decisions can be made with acceptable levels of confidence.

===Dynamic work strategies===
Dynamic work strategies are strategies that can be adapted to site conditions as new information becomes available while work is underway. This adaptation may be in response to data collection activities designed to address CSM unknowns, or it may be in response to completely unexpected site conditions encountered during the course of work.

Dynamic work strategies as part of a Triad approach can be included in almost every activity associated with hazardous waste site characterization and remediation. This includes overall project strategies, dynamic sampling and analysis programs (DSP,&lt;ref&gt;Albert Robbat, Jr., 1997, A Guideline for Dynamic Workplans and Field Analytics: The Keys to Cost-Effective Site Characterization and Cleanup [http://ase.tufts.edu/chemistry/robbat/documents/DynamicWorkplans.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; ASAP &lt;ref&gt;US-DOE, 2001. Adaptive Sampling and Analysis Programs (ASAPs). Report DOE/EM-0592 [https://frtr.gov/pdf/asap_2.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;) for characterization purposes, remedial action design, implementation, and performance monitoring, long-term monitoring for sites that require it, closure plans, and quality assurance/quality control activities.

===Innovative rapid sampling===
Sometimes referred to as 'real-time' measurement systems, these are analytical or measurement technologies&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char1_tech.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; capable of producing data quickly enough to direct the progress of field activities (characterization or remediation) while they are underway [http://www.triadcentral.org/mgmt/meas/key/index.cfm], analogous to [[Real time business intelligence|Real-time business intelligence]]. Example analytical methods include portable or handheld X-ray Fluorescence (pXRF [http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/xrf.cfm XRF]), portable gas chromatograph and mass spectrometry (GC-MS) technologies, and [[immunoassay]] [[test kit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cluin.org/char/technologies/immunoassay.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; New field analytical methods are fast developing. However, some have used standard laboratory approaches with quick turn-around results. The analysis enables in-field decision-making ''and'' ensures logical internal consistency among Triad concepts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/tio/download/char/epa542f07001.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual site models==
At the core of each project is the conceptual site model (CSM).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triadcentral.org/ref/ref/documents/CSM_checklist.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The term CSM is sometimes used to only describe pieces of the whole model. Geological, hydrogeological, contaminant fate and transport all may have computer models referred to as 'conceptual,' and a risk assessment may contain a CSM, but in a Triad sense, a CSM is the holistic model that can effectively portray site concerns significant to the decisions that must be made.

'''Truth to materials''' is a tenet of [[modern architecture]] (as opposed to [[postmodern architecture]]), which holds that any material should be used where it is most appropriate and its nature should not be hidden. Concrete, therefore, should not be painted and the means of its construction should be celebrated &amp;ndash; by, for instance, not sanding away marks left by timber shuttering (''[[béton brut]]'').  As another example, [[porcelain]] is infrequently used in the exterior facing of buildings, but one modern example is the [[Dakin Building]], [[Brisbane, California]]; therefore, the porcelain panels of this building have been left uncovered by any paint or preservative.

'''West Bengal Judicial Academy''' is a training institution for the Judges of the Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and officers of the [[West Bengal Judicial Service]]. The institution organises Induction Level Training for newly appointed Judicial Officers as well as entry level District Judges of West Bengal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbja.nic.in/|title=West Bengal Judicial Academy|last=|first=|date=|website=wbja.nic.in|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==History==
The [[Law Commission of India]] recommended to establish Judicial academies in various state of [[India]] for training of all Judges of the subordinate Judiciary. Subsequently the [[Supreme Court of India]] accepted those recommendations and on 28 February [[Calcutta High Court]] issued a notification to set up a state Judicial Academy under the name of West Bengal Judicial Academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wbja.nic.in/wbja_adm/files/Establishment.pdf|title=The Kolkata Gazette|last=|first=|date=June 14, 2005|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=August 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 September 2005, the [[Chief Justice of India]] Mr. Justice [[Y.K.

'''European countries''' have had varying policies that confine '''women and military service''' or the extent of their participation in the national [[armed services]] of their respective countries, especially [[combatant]] roles in [[armed conflicts]] or hostile environments. While most of the countries have always allowed women to participate in military activities involving no direct aggression with the [[enemy]], most began seeing the value of servicewomen in the armed services during the [[First World War]] when they began losing unprecedented numbers of servicemen. In modern times many of the European countries now allow women to voluntarily pursue a [[career]] path or [[profession]] in the national armed services of their country as well as permit [[conscription]] equality, with minimal or no restrictions at all.

==Denmark==

Women were employed in the Danish armed forces as early as 1934 with the Ground Observer Corps, Danish Women's Army Corps and Naval Corps in 1946 and the Women's Air Force since 1953. In 1962 the Danish parliament passed laws allowing women to volunteer in the regular Danish armed forces as long as they did not serve in units experiencing direct combat. 1971 saw the enlistment of women as non-commissioned officers, with military academies allowing women in 1974.

In 1978, based on the reports of studies on the topic, women were allowed to enlist in an all areas of the Danish armed forces, with combat trials in the eighties exploring the capabilities of women in combat. In 1998 laws were passed allowing women to sample military life in the same way as conscripted men, however without being completely open to conscription. Women in the Danish military come under the command of the Chief of Defense.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;[http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/denmark.htm NATO/IMS: Committee on Women in the NATO Forces: Denmark&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2009|7}} the highest rank reached by a woman in the Danish armed forces is Colonel (Susanne Bach Bager, Telegrafregimentet), with 5.2% (832) women in the services: 153 officers, 176 NCOs, and 503 privates (not counting women serving as "concripts").&lt;ref&gt;http://forsvaret.dk/FPT/Nyt%20og%20Presse/fakta/kvinderiforsvaret/Pages/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; From the summer 2007 to July 2009 a total of 84 women have served in the Danish Battalion in Helmand province, Afghanistan. This includes frontline service in infantry units and active participation in combat. However recent recruitment of women has been low in Denmark due to rising job opportunities elsewhere. NATO reports also indicate that the Danish military does not promote women to positions of leadership.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

As with many nations with women in their armed forces, Denmark has different basic physical requirements for men and women in their armed forces, however the requirements for the more physically demanding jobs do not differ for either sex.

==Finland==

[[Image:Suomalaisia naissotilaita vannomassa sotilasvalaa.jpg|thumb|Finnish female soldiers swearing their military oath alongside male conscripts.]]
The [[Finnish Defense Forces]] does not conscript women. However, since 1995, women between 18 and 30 years of age have the possibility of voluntarily undertaking military service in the Defence Forces or in the [[Finnish Border Guard|Border Guard]]. Females serve under the same conditions as men, with the exception that during the first 45 days of service they have the option to leave the military without consequences. After that, they must complete the service which lasts 6, 9 or 12 months. After the service, the females face the same reserve obligations as the males who have done the obligatory military service. If the female in national service experiences a conscientious crisis which prevents her from fulfilling her military service or reserve obligations, she is ordered to the alternative civilian service, which lasts 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1995/19950194 Law on the voluntary military service for women (194/1995)] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

All services and units in the Finnish Defence Forces and the Finnish Border Guard accept females. In garrison environment, the females are lodged in separate rooms and are given separate toilet and bath facilities. In exercises and aboard ships, women are lodged with men. The women in national service are given an extra allowance of €0,40 per diem for sanitary articles and smallclothes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naiset.dsp Finnish Defence Forces. Naiset armeijassa.] {{Fi}} Retrieved 2-20-2007&lt;/ref&gt; The females in military service are usually well motivated and some 60% of them receive either NCO or reserve officer training. Yearly, some 500 women complete the voluntary military service, while some 30,000 men complete the obligatory conscription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/varusmies/naisten_vapaaehtoinen_asepalvelus.dsp Finnish Defence Forces.

The women who have completed the voluntary military service are eligible for further military employment. If they have at least NCO training, they can apply for career NCO positions or for officer training. These career paths have been open since 1996, when the first women completed the military service. In 2005, 32 female career officers were in service. The number of female warrant officers was 16 and the number of female specialist officers 7. In comparison, there were a total of 2.584 officers and 894 specialist officers in service. The women made up about 16% of the total career NCO cadre. However, most of these career NCOs were grandfathered former female enlistees who had not undertaken military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/perustietoa/toiminnantuloksellisuus/pdf/htp05.pdf Finnish Defence Forces.

[[Image:Naispunakaartilainen.jpg|thumb|upright|Female Red Guard soldier from [[Finnish Civil War]]]]
The history of women in the Finnish military is, however, far longer than just since 1995. During the [[Finnish Civil War]], the [[Red Guards (Finland)|Reds]] had several ''Naiskaarti'' (Women's Guard) units made of voluntary 16- to 35-year-old women, who were given rudimentary military training. The reactions on women in military were ambivalent during the Civil War. The fighting women of the Reds were shunned in the [[White Guard (Finland)|White]] propaganda but in the Red side propaganda they were admired and also compared to the "[[amazons]] of old".&lt;ref&gt;[http://vanha.hum.utu.fi/historia/raunistula/yhteiskunta/naiskaarti/kaarti7.html Hakala, A. Naissoturin muotokuva]. Turun yliopisto. Retrieved 3-9-2007. {{Fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White side founded their own female organization, [[Lotta Svärd]] in November 1918. While the ''Lottas'' were not front line fighting units per sé, as a paramilitary organization they handled several important second-line duties freeing men to the actual fighting service. A voluntary Lotta unit manned a searchlight battery of Finnish [[anti-aircraft artillery]] in defense of Helsinki in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/ruotuvaki/index.dsp?action=read_page&amp;pid=36&amp;aid=530 Valonheitinlotat - ainutlaatuinen osa historiaa].

In 1961, the Finnish Defence Forces started to enlist females for second-line duties. The duties available to women were radar operator, sea-control person, and C3 person. Most of the female enlisted served in coastal artillery and [[Finnish Air Force]]. The women enlisted all served in the rank of ''värvätty'' (enlisted), using a special female uniform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soal.fi/tietopankki/index.php?group=00000210&amp;mag_nr=5 Sotilasammattiliitto SoAL ry.

In the beginning of the year 2007, the term enlisted (''värvätty'') was changed to NCO (''aliupseeri'') to better recognize the change in the duties of this personnel group. The female enlistees who had not undertaken military service were grandfathered. They remain in the rank of enlistee unless they complete the conscript NCO course.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mil.fi/tyojakoulutus/tehtavat/aliupseerit.dsp Aliupseerit: Sotilasammattihenkilöistä aliupseereiksi.] Finnish Defence Forces.

The non-combat duties in Finnish Defence Forces [[peace-keeping]] operations opened to women in 1991. At first, the women without previous military training experienced rather large problems in the Finnish peace-keeping units, most remarkably in the [[Republic of Macedonia]] in the mid-1990s. Since the introduction of the voluntary military service, the women have mostly the same training as the men which has lessened the problems. Only a handful of women without military training, mostly nurses or social service personnel, are serving with the Finnish peace-keeping forces. All duties in Finnish foreign operations are open to women, provided they have the necessary military training.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/ohjelmat/45min_2003/arkisto.shtml?91386 Naisista tasa-arvoisia rauhanturvaajia.] MTV3 news service.

==France==
[[File:Cantiniere1800s.jpg|thumb|A [[Cantinière]] with a male infantry soldier in Algeria, around 1845. Painting by Edouard Moreau.]]

In the 1800s, women in the French military were responsible for preparing meals for soldiers, and were called [[Cantinières]]. They sold food to soldiers beyond that which was given to them as rations. Cantinières had commissions from the administrators of the regiments, and they were required to be married to a soldier of the regiment. They served near the front lines on active campaigns, and some served for as long as 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Following the drums: Cantinieres|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/military/organization/c_cantinieres.html|accessdate=August 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The role of women in the French military grew in 1914 with the recruitment of women as medical personnel (Service de Santé des Armées). In 1939, they were authorized to enlist with the armed service branches, and in 1972 their status evolved to share the same ranks as those of men. Nonetheless, women are still not permitted to join the field combat units or to be aboard the submarines of the French navy.

[[Valérie André]], a neurosurgeon, became the first woman in France to attain the rank of three-star general as Médecin Général Inspecteur. A veteran of the [[French Resistance]], she served overseas in [[Indochina]]. During that period, she learned how to pilot a helicopter so that she could reach wounded soldiers who were trapped in the jungle. André is the first woman to have flown a helicopter in combat. She received many decorations for her achievements, including the highest rank of the [[Legion of Honour]]. She retired from active service in 1981. Many other French women were involved in the [[Women in the French Resistance|French Resistance]].

==Germany==
[[Image:Ulrike Flender.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ulrike Flender]]—in 2007 became the first female [[German Air Force]] jet-fighter pilot and first German female [[Panavia Tornado]] pilot.]]

Since the creation of the [[Bundeswehr]] in 1955, Germany had employed one of the most conservative gender-policies of any NATO country. That was generally regarded as a reaction to the deployment of young women at the end of [[World War II]]. Though women were exempt from direct combat functions in accordance with Nazi-ideology, several hundred thousand German women, along with young boys and sometimes girls (as [[Flakhelfer]]), served in [[Luftwaffe]] artillery units; their flak shot down thousands of Allied warplanes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistoryprojects.com/downloads/H491/women-combat.htm D'Ann Campbell, "Women in Combat: The World War Two Experience in the United States, Great Britain, Germany, and the Soviet Union" ''Journal of Military History'' (April 1993), 57:301-323 online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the year 1975 the first female medical officers were appointed in the ''Sanitätsdienst'' ([[Medical corps]]) of the Bundeswehr. Since 1994, two women, [[Verena von Weymarn]] and Erika Franke, attained the rank of ''[[Generalarzt]]'' (Surgeon General). But it was not until January 2001 that women first joined German combat units, following a court ruling by the [[European Court of Justice]]. The change in the law was prompted after a qualified female [[electronics technician]] argued her case to the European Court of Justice after her application to join the Maintenance-Recovery Service (Electronics) technical unit of the German Armed Forces was rejected in 1996, citing "it is barred by German law for women to perform armed services". The court ruled that preventing women from occupying combat roles in the armed forces was against sexual equality principles. 244 of the first 1,900 women who signed up following the law change were admitted on the first day of the new rules, the majority of them joining the army and air force.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1097492.stm Women join German fighting forces]&lt;/ref&gt; 
There are no restrictions regarding the branch of service, and there are women serving in the ''[[Fallschirmjäger]]'' (paratrooper), aboard [[submarine]]s and jet-fighter aircraft. Before the law change 4,400 women only occupied [[military medicine]] or [[Military band|military-band]] roles within the German armed forces. The new legislations initially did not receive full military support. A report on the subject commented that, regarding the older male soldiers, "The way they see themselves as male fighters is shattered". Like many countries who have accepted women into combat roles, Germany conducts special courses on preventing sexual harassment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

After several years of experience the commotion inside the Bundeswehr has now remarkably decreased. Today women are regularly being sent to foreign deployments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1842630,00.html Germany Marks Five Years of Women in Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 about 16,900 female soldiers serve in the Bundeswehr, representing a share of 9 percent of all troops except conscripted soldiers. The German Bundeswehr now expects the percentage of all female personnel to rise to about 15 percent in the middle-term future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundeswehr.de/portal/a/bwde/kcxml/04_Sj9SPykssy0xPLMnMz0vM0Y_QjzKLd443DgwBSUGYAfqR6GIBIQixoJRUfW99X4_83FT9AP2C3NCIckdHRQAlYgRn/delta/base64xml/L2dJQSEvUUt3QS80SVVFLzZfQ180QTc!?yw_contentURL=/C1256EF4002AED30/W27DXCZE807INFODE/content.jsp Starke Truppe – Immer mehr Frauen entscheiden sich für die Bundeswehr (Powerful troop - more and more women join the Bundeswehr)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the first woman in the German air force received her jet-fighter licence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesregierung.de/nn_6562/Content/EN/Artikel/2006/09/2006-09-26-erste-frau-im-jet-cockpit__en.html First woman to attain air force qualification as jet pilot]&lt;/ref&gt; A handful more are flying helicopters and transport planes.

==Ireland==
The Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1979, allowed women to join the [[Irish Defence Forces]] for the first time and was passed by the [[Oireachtas]] in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1979/en/act/pub/0028/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions for women to the "full range of operational and administrative duties."&lt;ref&gt;http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0658/D.0658.200807020061.html&lt;/ref&gt; As of January 2010 the number of women in the Permanent Defence Forces is 565, 5.7 percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;http://debates.oireachtas.ie/DDebate.aspx?F=DAL20100224.xml&amp;Page=1&amp;Ex=1236#N1236&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
[[File:Italian Soldier Olypmic Games Turin 2006.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Italian parachutist]]
During [[World War II]], the [[Italian Social Republic]] established the Female Volunteer Unit ({{lang-it|Corpo volontario femmnile}}) as an auxiliary service and their soldiers were known as Female Auxiliary Unit ({{lang-it|Servizio Ausiliario Femminile}}). The law that introduced this unit provided that its existence be limited to war periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tiscali.it/RSI_ANALISI/34.htm|title=Decreto istitutivo del Corpo femminile|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its equivalent in [[Southern Italy]] during World War II, was the ''CAF'', {{lang-it|Corpo di Assistenza Femminile}}, that was on the side of the [[Allies]]. This unit was also dismissed at the end of the war. Those who belonged to this unit were equivalent to [[sub-lieutenants]] and wore military uniforms made in [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.museobadoglio.altervista.org/docs/forze.pdf|title=Forze del Regno del Sud|access-date=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, the Female Police unit ({{lang-it|Corpo di Polizia femminile}}) was established.

In 1981, Diadora Bussani was the first woman who asked to be admitted  into the [[Italian Naval Academy]] of [[Livorno]] ({{lang-it|Accademia navale di Livorno}}). She was born in 1962 in [[Trieste]] and started to try to join the academy in 1981. After being excluded from the application, Italy's regional administrative court upheld the appeal; however, Italy's State Council overturned the judgment. The enlisting of a woman seemed to be legally feasible because of the Italian law Legge 1963 n. 66, which allowed the enrollment of women in public positions, but Italy's State Council excluded the military because of biological differences between male and female human bodies. When Diadora Bussani became famous and the case was well-known, the [[United States Navy]] symbolically granted her enlistment on 2 November 1982.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bloogger.it/2018/06/italiane-in-armi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Voluntary female military service was introduced in 1999 with the Italian law Legge 20 ottobre 1999 n. 380, which introduced the possibility of being admitted to the army for women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informagiovani.it/frame/_donnemiliti.htm Informagiovani]&lt;/ref&gt; Italy was the last country among [[NATO]] members to allow women to deploy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carabinieri.it/Internet/Editoria/Rassegna+Arma/2004/Suppl_3/I+Sessione/01_Sessione_03.htm#3 L'impatto del servizio militare femminile.

Nowadays women are present in all branches of Italian armed forces, including the police, and the [[Guardia di Finanza]], and they are also employed for military missions abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.difesa.it/APPROFONDIMENTI/ARCHIVIOAPPROFONDIMENTI/SERVIZIO_FEMMINILE/Pagine/default.aspx Ministero della Difesa]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the year 2000, women were employed in war only as voluntary nurses inside the organizations [[Croce Rossa Italiana]] and of [[Corpo delle infermiere volontarie dell'ACISMOM]]. 235º Reggimento fanteria "Piceno" is the training center for women inside the Italian army.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esercito.difesa.it/organizzazione/capo-di-sme/comando-per-la-formazione-specializzazione-e-dottrina-dell-esercito/Scuola-di-Fanteria/Centro-Addestramento-Volontari/235-RAV-Piceno Esercito.difesa]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Norway==
Women in Norway have been serving in military roles since 1938. During the Second World War both enlisted women and female officers served in all branches of the military. However, in 1947 political changes commanded that women only serve in civilian posts, with reservists allowing women to join in 1959.

Between 1977 and 1984, the Norwegian Parliament passed laws expanding the role of women in the Norwegian Armed Forces, and in 1985 equal opportunities legislation was applied to the military. 
In 1995, Norway became the first country to allow women to serve on its military [[submarines]]

In a further step in favour of gender equality in the armed services, the Norwegian parliament voted, with a strong majority, the 14th of June 2014, a [[Bill (law)|bill]] to extend [[Conscription|compulsory military service]] to females from mid-2016. Norway is the first NATO member and first European country to make national service compulsory for both sexes.&lt;ref name="NMMSW"&gt;[http://rt.com/news/197152-norway-army-women-military-conscripts/ Girls in the army: Norway passes bill on mandatory military service for women]&lt;/ref&gt; It will apply to all medically fit Norwegian citizens between age 19-44 born from 1997 onwards.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt; Women born in 1997 and onwards will also be subject to conscription during wartime.&lt;ref name="NMMSW" /&gt;

As of 2017, 1341 of the 11596 military personnel in the Norwegian military forces were women (12%). Of all the conscriped soldiers the same year, the female percentage was 23%. c&lt;ref&gt;https://forsvaret.no/fakta_/ForsvaretDocuments/Forsvarets_aarsrapport_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January 2017, major general Tonje Skinnarland became the first-ever appointed woman to be the head of the Royal Norwegian air force.

==Poland==
Women have taken part in the battles for independence against occupiers and invaders since at least the time of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. During the occupation by the [[Nazi]]s, 1939–1945, several thousand women took part in the resistance movement as members of the [[Home Army]]. The Germans were forced to establish special [[prisoner-of-war camp]]s after the [[Warsaw Rising]] in 1944 to accommodate over a thousand women prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polishresistance-ak.org/12%20Article.htm Women in Home Army]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1938 the law requiring compulsory military service for men included provisions for voluntary service of women in auxiliary roles, in the medical services, in the anti-aircraft artillery and in communications. In 1939 a Women's Military Training Organization was established under the command of [[Maria Wittek]].

In present Poland a law passed April 6, 2004 requires all women with college [[nursing]] or [[veterinary]] degrees to register for compulsory service. In addition it allows women to volunteer and serve as professional personnel in all services of the army. As of June 30, 2007 there are 800 women in the army, of which 471 are officers, 308 non-commissioned officers and 21 other ranks, in addition 225 are in military training schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kadry.wp.mil.pl/artykul.php?idartykul=20 Women in army - in Polish]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Russia==
{{Main| Women in the Russian and Soviet military}}

The first woman known to have enlisted in the Russian Army was [[Nadezhda Durova]] who, pretending to be a man, fought with distinction in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. At that time, however, she was very much of a unique exception in an all-male army.

During the [[First World War]], heavy defeats led to the loss of millions of [[Russian Empire|Russian Imperial]] soldiers. To psychologically energize morale [[Alexander Kerensky]] (leader of Russia of the [[Russian Provisional Government]]) ordered the creation of the Woman’s Death Battalion in May 1917. After three months of fighting, the size of this all-female unit fell from 2,000 to 250.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/Wdeath.htm Women's Death Battalion&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1917, the [[Bolsheviks]] dissolved the unit. Shortly after Russia became part of the [[Soviet Union]] (see above for the role of woman in Soviet military) till December 1991.

The current tally of woman in the Russian Army is standing at around 115,000 to 160,000, representing 10% of Russia’s military strength.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} They're not allowed in combat roles, however.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

The Russian army runs the [[Miss Russian Army]] beauty contest for attractive female Russian soldiers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Colonel Gennady Dzyuba, of the Defense Ministry, said of the 2005 contest that "Those who have served, especially in hot spots, know the importance of women in the [[armed forces]]."{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

===Soviet Union: 1917–1991===

{{Main| Soviet women in the Great Patriotic War}}
Women had the legal right to serve in the [[Red Army|Soviet Armed Forces]] throughout the post Second World War period, with many all-female units existing as far back as World War One. By the early 1990s, 100,000 women made up 3% of the Soviet Armed Forces.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:LyudmilaPavlichenko1.jpg|thumb|Lyudmila Pavlichenko]] --&gt;

During the Second World War, the Soviet Union had a female military strength of over one million women [http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/aureview/1982/jan-feb/obrien.html] who served as snipers, machine gunners, and tank crew members. Very few of these women, however, were ever promoted to officers.

In 1942 the [[Soviet Union]] formed three regiments of women combat pilots to fly night bombing missions over Germany, the 588th Night Bomber Regiment, later called the 46th Taman Guards Night Bomber Aviation Regiment. These women took part in regular harassment bombing against the Germans in [[Polikarpov Po-2]] biplanes, and participated in the final onslaught against Berlin. The regiments, collectively known to the Germans as the "Nachthexen" ("[[Night Witches]]"), flew more than 24,000 sorties and won in total 23 [[Hero of the Soviet Union]] medals. Some of the most talented women pilots were assigned day fighter duties. [[Lydia Litvyak|"Lily" Litvak]] and [[Katya Budanova]] became fighter aces flying the Soviet Union's best fighter designs alongside men in day attacks. Both were killed in their aircraft. Meanwhile, in the ground combat role [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], made 309 confirmed kills including 36 enemy snipers. Pavlichenko was one of the many female snipers of the Soviet Army.

In 1967, the Soviet Universal Military Duty Laws concluded that women offered the greater source of available combat soldiers during periods of large-scale mobilisation. Thus, several programs during the height of the cold war were set up to encourage women to enlist. Participation in military orientated youth programs and forced participation in the reserves for ex-servicewomen up to the age of 40 are some examples. Universities contained reservist officer training which accompanied a place in the reserves themselves.

In the Soviet Union civil universities, in addition to professional education, gave basic military training to the youth of both sexes. Many secondary schools in [[post-Soviet countries]] still have defense lessons, both for boys and girls.

==Serbia==
 {{commonscat|Military women of Serbia}}
Although the Serbian combat forces were traditionally exclusively male (with exception of nurses and some other non-combat roles) there were some exceptions. Several women are known to have fought in the ranks in the [[Balkan Wars]] and the [[First World War]], often by initially hiding their gender to work around the draft regulations. The most notable of them was [[Milunka Savić]]. In the [[Second World War]] [[Yugoslav Partisans|Yugoslav partisan units]] accepted female volunteers as combatants as well as medical personnel. After the war the practice was abandoned, but was reintroduced recently with professionalisation of the army.

In Yugoslavia (including Serbia and other states), two million women were directly involved in non-combat support roles with Yugoslavia's partisans, and 100,000 served in the partisan army during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Jancar, "Women in the Yugoslav National Liberation Movement: An Overview," ''Studies in Comparative Communism'' (1981) 14#2 pp 143-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
In the Military Articles of 1621, which organized the Swedish army, military men on all levels were explicitly allowed to bring their wives with them to war, as the wives were regarded to fill an important role as [[sutler]]s in the house hold organisation of the army: prostitutes, however, were banned.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"&gt;Sjöberg, Maria: ''Kvinnor i fält 1550-1850.'' [Women in Combat] Gidlund (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  This regulation was kept until the Military Article of 1798, though the presence of women diminished after the end of the [[Great Northern War]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; In the Military Article of 1798, the only women allowed to accompany the army was the professional unmarried female sutlers, in Sweden named ''marketenterska''.&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt; Unofficially, however, there were females who served in the army posing as male the entire period, the most famous being [[Ulrika Eleonora Stålhammar]].&lt;ref name="Sjöberg, Maria 1850"/&gt;

In 1924, the [[Swedish Women's Voluntary Defence Service]] (Swedish: Riksförbundet Sveriges lottakårer, commonly known as Lottorna) was founded: it is an auxiliary defense organization of the [[Swedish Home Guard]], a part of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]].

Since 1989 there are no gender restrictions in the Swedish military on access to military training or positions. They are allowed to serve in all parts of the military and in all positions, including combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id%3D11756 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927045646/http://www.rekryc.mil.se/article.php?id=11756 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |df= }} in Swedish, Retrieved 04-23-2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Turkey==
[[File:Breguet 19 Sabiha.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female pilot to fly during a conflict, 1937]]
When Turkish history is examined, it is apparent that Turkish women have voluntarily taken tasks in the defence of their country, showing the same power and courage as men. [[Nene Hatun]], whose monument has been erected in the city of Erzurum (Eastern Turkey) because of her gallant bravery during the Ottoman-Russian War, constitutes a very good example of this fact. Furthermore, the Independence War has taken its place in history with the unsurpassed heroism of Turkish women.&lt;ref name="nato.int"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2001/win/turkey.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sabiha Gökçen]] was the first female combat pilot in the world, as well as the first Turkish female aviator. She was one of the eight adoptive children of [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]]. Throughout her career in the Turkish Air Force, Gökçen flew 22 different types of aircraft for more than 8,000 hours, 32 hours of which were active combat and bombardment missions. She was selected as the only female pilot for the poster of "20 Greatest Aviators in History" published by the United States Air Force in 1996.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.ctie.monash.edu.au/hargrave/gokcen.html Sabiha Gokcen (1913-2001), Pioneer Aviatrix&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Women personnel are being employed as officers in the Turkish Armed Forces today. The women officers serve together with the men under the same respective chains of command. The personnel policy regarding women in the Turkish Armed Forces is based on the principle of "needing qualified women officers in suitable branches and ranks" to keep pace with technological advancements in the 21st century. Women civilian personnel have been assigned to the headquarters staff, technical fields, and social services without sexual discrimination. Women officers serve in all branches except armour, infantry, and submarines. Assignments, promotions and training are considered on an equal basis with no gender bias.&lt;ref name="nato.int"/&gt;

As of the year 2005, the number of the female officers and NCOs in the Turkish Armed Forces is 1245.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;http://www.nato.int/ims/2005/win/national_reports/turkey.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==

Women may now join the British Armed forces in all roles except those whose "primary duty is to close with and kill the enemy": [[British Army Infantry|Infantry]], [[Household Cavalry]], [[Royal Armoured Corps]], [[Royal Marines|Royal Marines Commandos]], [[RAF Regiment]], [[Special Air Service]] and [[Special Boat Service]]. In addition medical reasons{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} used to preclude service in the [[Royal Navy Submarine Service]] or as Mine Clearance Divers, but in May 2014 it was announced that three women had become the RN's first female submariners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Royal Navy gets first female submariners|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27278588|accessdate=5 May 2014|newspaper=[[BBC]]|date=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are however, permitted access to special force's support units, such as commando engineers and are cleared to join the [[Special Reconnaissance Regiment]], a largely unknown branch of the [[United Kingdom Special Forces]] that does not bar women from joining.

Female personnel currently make up around 9% of the British armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm Defence Factsheet, Women in the Armed Forces] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929073139/http://www.mod.uk/DefenceInternet/FactSheets/WomenInTheArmedForces.htm |date=2012-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, female combatants can be found throughout Britain’s military history.&lt;ref&gt;BBC news [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6502847.stm article] on Women in Combat, retrieved on March 29, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example is Queen [[Boudica]], who led warriors of the Iceni tribe against Roman forces occupying Britain around AD 62, her legacy being often quoted in support of arguments calling for the full opening up of the British Armed forces to women.

In the medieval period, Queens and noblewomen such as [[Ethelfleda]] of Mercia, [[Matilda of England]], [[Isabella of France]] and [[Margaret of Anjou]] commanded armies in battle, although they did not fight themselves. Many women including Queen [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]] accompanied their husbands on Crusade. In the 16th century [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], accompanied troops in several campaigns. Women continued to lead armies or organise the defense of castles in the absence of their male relatives until the close of the [[English Civil War]]. Charles I's consort, [[Henrietta Maria of France]] was the last English queen to command troops in battle in northern England in 1643.

During the 1776 American War of Independence, it is estimated that over 5,000 women accompanied British forces. Many of these would have been the wives of high-ranking officers, with a large proportion being the wives of serving soldiers. While as much as possible women were left in the camp, they sometimes accompanied forces in their baggage trains serving as cooks or nurses, and were occasionally caught in combat and killed or taken prisoner. Similarly women accompanied men in ships of the [[Royal Navy]], in combat being employed as powder monkeys or assisting [[surgeon]]s.

During [[World War I]] the British Women’s Army Auxiliary Corps was formed; Lieutenant-General H Lawson recommended using it in France in 1917. Sir Neville Macready, the Adjutant-General, supported the idea that women and men should be treated the same at the front. Women served in the British Army during World War One as cooks, medical staff and clerical staff, however women were not permitted to be officers, and there were many disputes over pay. In 1917 the [[Women's Royal Naval Service]] (WRNS) was formed, although then disbanded in 1919 It provided catering and administrative support, communications and electrician personnel.

Prior to [[World War II]], in 1938 the Auxiliary Territorial Service (ATS) was created, with 20,000 women serving in non-combat roles during the conflict as well as serving as military police. Some women took part in direct combat roles as part of mixed gender teams manning heavy anti-aircraft batteries and gun crews within Britain. Women members of the teams might sight and aim anti-aircraft guns and even give the command to fire, but the actual release of the trigger was always (officially at least) reserved for a male soldier. A number of women operated on active service in wartime Europe with special services, engaged in intelligence, sabotage and laison with local resistance groups. During the war, the First Aid Nursing Yeomanry was incorporated into the ATS. The WRNS was reformed at the outbreak of war in 1939, with an increased range of shore-based opportunities available.

In 1949 women were officially recognized as a permanent part of British Armed forces, although full combat roles were still available only to men. In this year, the Women's Royal Army Corps was created to replace the WAAC, and in 1950 the ranks were normalised with the ranks of men serving in the British Army.

The 1991 Gulf War marked the first deployment of British women in combat operations since 1945. Women were engaged in a broad range of support operations up to 8&amp;nbsp;km from the front line. In 1992 British Army units devoted only to women were disbanded, and women were distributed amongst the same units in which men served. During the 1990s an increasing number of roles were opened up to women including direct combat support roles in intelligence, artillery, engineering and signals.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Woodward, Trish Winter, ''Sexing the soldier: the politics of gender and the contemporary British Army,'' Routledge, (2007) pp. 33-35&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 seagoing opportunities were opened to WRNS personnel leading to the full integration of the WRNS with the Royal Navy in 1993. To date several female personnel have commanded small ships of the RN and a recently retired Commanding Officer of [[HMNB Clyde|HM Naval Base, Clyde]], Commodore Carolyn Stait, is a former WRNS Officer.

The [[2007 Iranian seizure of Royal Navy personnel|seizure]] of [[Royal Navy]] sailor [[Faye Turney]] in 2007 by the [[Navy of the Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|naval forces of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] led to some media comment on the role of women and mothers in the armed forces.&lt;ref name="indy"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://comment.independent.co.uk/commentators/article2411286.ece |title= Only the capture of Prince Harry could have done more damage |publisher=[[The Independent]] |date=2007-04-01 |accessdate=2007-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[commander-in-chief]] of the British Armed Forces is a woman ([[Queen Elizabeth II]]) though her position is only nominal.
