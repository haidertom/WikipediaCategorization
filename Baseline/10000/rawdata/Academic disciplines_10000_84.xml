      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2573">The '''Anticato''' (sometimes '''Anti-Cato'''; [[Latin]]: '''''Anticatones''''') was a [[polemic]] written by [[Julius Caesar]] in hostile reply to [[Cicero]]'s pamphlet praising [[Cato the Younger]]. The text is lost and survives only in fragments.  [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]], dissatisfied with Cicero's work, wrote a second pamphlet in praise of Cato and called, simply, "Cato," which provoked a reply from [[Octavian]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], Life of Augustus 85.1 http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/suetonius/suet.aug.html#85&lt;/ref&gt;  Octavian's work is not known to have been called Anticato but must have been modeled on Caesar's reply to Cicero.

== Background ==
{{main|Cato the Younger}}
Cato was a famously stubborn [[Stoicism|Stoic]], who came into conflict with Caesar at the [[Second Catilinarian conspiracy|Catiline conspiracy]] trial. Cato argued for capital punishment for [[Lucius Sergius Catilina]] and his conspirators, so as to set an example and discourage similar [[treason]]. Caesar argued for a private judgement and clemency. The Senate agreed with Cato, and the executions were carried out; the rebel army disbanded and fled. During the debate, however, Cato had called out Caesar for reading personal messages in the Senate; Caesar defended himself, saying he was only reading a [[love letter]]. Cato insisted on reading it, and to widespread dismay, it was what Caesar said—exposing his affair with [[Servilia (mother of Marcus Junius Brutus)|Servilia]], the half-sister of Cato. Servilia was forced to divorce.

Next, during the [[triumvirate]] of Caesar, [[Pompey]], and [[Marcus Licinius Crassus]], Cato interfered with Caesar's plans for a [[Roman triumph|triumph]] for himself, while supporting one for Pompey. Cato opposed Caesar's every political step afterward, in particular leading the opposition to Caesar's return to Rome in 49 BC without relinquishing his proconsulship. Caesar famously crossed the [[Rubicon]] and came to Rome regardless, sparking the Roman Civil War. When Caesar prevailed in the war and looked to seize power in Rome, Cato committed suicide.

Several leading Romans wrote works in posthumous praise or criticism of Cato. A famous [[panegyric]] by [[Cicero]] titled simply ''Cato'' led to Caesar writing his ''Anticato'' in response.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="17061">The '''approximate number system''' ('''ANS''') is a cognitive system that supports the estimation of the [[Magnitude (mathematics)|magnitude]] of a group without relying on language or symbols.  The ANS is credited with the non-symbolic representation of all numbers greater than four, with lesser values being carried out by the [[parallel individuation system]], or object tracking system.&lt;ref name="Piazza"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M.|title=Neurocognitive start-up tools for symbolic number representations|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|year=2010|volume=14|doi=10.1016/j.tics.2010.09.008|pages=542–551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in early infancy, the ANS allows an individual to detect differences in magnitude between groups.  The precision of the ANS improves throughout childhood development and reaches a final adult level of approximately 15% accuracy, meaning an adult could distinguish 100 items versus 115 items without counting.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sousa|first=David|title=Mind, Brain, and Education: Neuroscience Implications for the Classroom|year=2010|publisher=Solution Tree Press|isbn=9781935249634}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ANS plays a crucial role in development of other numerical abilities, such as the concept of exact number and simple arithmetic.

==History==

===Piaget's theory===
[[Jean Piaget]] was a Swiss [[developmental psychologist]] who devoted much of his life to studying how children learn.  A book summarizing his theories on number cognition, ''The Child's Conception of Number'', was published in 1952.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Piaget's work supported the viewpoint that children do not have a stable representation of number until the age of six or seven.  His theories indicate that mathematical knowledge is slowly gained and during infancy any concept of sets, objects, or calculation is absent.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===Challenging the Piagetian viewpoint===
Piaget's ideas pertaining to the absence of [[Numerical cognition|mathematical cognition]] at birth have been steadily challenged.  The work of [[Rochel Gelman]] and [[C. Randy Gallistel]] among others in the 1970s suggested that preschoolers have intuitive understanding of the quantity of a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] and its conservation under non cardinality-related changes, expressing surprise when objects disappear without an apparent cause.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

===Current theory===
Beginning as infants, people have an innate sense of approximate number that depends on the ratio between sets of objects.&lt;ref name="cantlon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantlon|first=JF|title=Functional Imaging of Numerical Processing in Adults and 4-y-old Children|journal=PLoS Biology|year=2006|volume=4|issue=5|doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040125|pmid=16594732|pmc=1431577|pages=e125}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout life the ANS becomes more developed, and people are able to distinguish between groups having smaller differences in magnitude.&lt;ref name="hyde2"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=DC|title=Near-infrared spectroscopy shows right parietal specialization for number in pre-verbal infants.|journal=NeuroImage|year=2010|volume=53|issue=2|pages=647–652|doi=10.1016/j.neuroimage.2010.06.030|pmid=20561591|pmc=2930081}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ratio of distinction is defined by [[Weber–Fechner law|Weber's law]], which relates the different intensities of a [[Stimulus (physiology)|sensory stimulus]] that is being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pessoa|first=L|author2=Desimone R.|title=From Humble Neural Beginnings Comes Knowledge of Numbers|journal=Neuron|year=2003|volume=37|issue=1|pages=4–6|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(02)01179-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the case of the ANS, as the ratio between the magnitudes increases, the ability to discriminate between the two quantities increases.

Today, some theorize that the ANS lays the foundation for higher-level arithmetical concepts.  Research has shown that the same areas of the brain are active during non-symbolic number tasks in infants and both non-symbolic and more sophisticated symbolic number tasks in adults.&lt;ref name="Piazza3"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Piazza|first=M|title=A magnitude code common to numerosity and number symbols in human intraparietal cortex.|journal=Neuron|year=2007|volume=53|issue=2|pages=293–305|doi=10.1016/j.neuron.2006.11.022}}&lt;/ref&gt;   These results could suggest that the ANS contributes over time to the development of higher-level numerical skills that activate the same part of the brain.

However, longitudinal studies do not necessarily find that non-symbolic abilities predict later symbolic abilities. Conversely, early symbolic number abilities have been found to predict later non-symbolic abilities, not vice versa as predicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Symbolic Number Abilities Predict Later Approximate Number System Acuity in Preschool Children|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0091839|journal = PLoS ONE|date = 2014-03-17|pmc = 3956743|pmid = 24637785|pages = e91839|volume = 9|issue = 3|doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0091839|first = Christophe|last = Mussolin|first2 = Julie|last2 = Nys|first3 = Alain|last3 = Content|first4 = Jacqueline|last4 = Leybaert}}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults for example, non-symbolic number abilities do not always explain mathematics achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Non-verbal number acuity correlates with symbolic mathematics achievement: but only in children|journal = Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|date = 2011-12-01|issn = 1531-5320|pmid = 21898191|pages = 1222–1229|volume = 18|issue = 6|doi = 10.3758/s13423-011-0154-1|first = Matthew|last = Inglis|first2 = Nina|last2 = Attridge|first3 = Sophie|last3 = Batchelor|first4 = Camilla|last4 = Gilmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neurological basis==
Brain imaging studies have identified the [[parietal lobe]] as being a key brain region for numerical cognition.&lt;ref name="Dehaene"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dehaene|first=S|title=Three parietal circuits for number processing.|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|year=2003|volume=20|issue=3|pages=487–506|doi=10.1080/02643290244000239|pmid=20957581}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Specifically within this lobe is the [[intraparietal sulcus]] which is "active whenever we think about a number, whether spoken or written, as a word or as an [[Arabic numerals|Arabic digit]], or even when we inspect a set of objects and think about its cardinality".&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  When comparing groups of objects, activation of the intraparietal sulcus is greater when the difference between groups is numerical rather than an alternative factor, such as differences in shape or size.&lt;ref name="cantlon" /&gt;  This indicates that the intraparietal sulcus plays an active role when the ANS is employed to approximate magnitude.

Parietal lobe brain activity seen in adults is also observed during infancy during non-verbal numerical tasks, suggesting that the ANS is present very early in life.&lt;ref name="hyde2" /&gt;     A neuroimaging technique, [[fNIR|functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy]], was performed on infants revealing that the parietal lobe is specialized for number representation before the development of language.&lt;ref name="hyde2" /&gt;     This indicates that numerical cognition may be initially reserved to the right hemisphere of the brain and becomes bilateral through experience and the development of complex number representation.

It has been shown that the intraparietal sulcus is activated independently of the type of task being performed with the number.  The intensity of activation is dependent on the difficulty of the task, with the intraparietal sulcus showing more intense activation when the task is more difficult.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  In addition, studies in monkeys have shown that individual [[neuron]]s can fire preferentially to certain numbers over others.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  For example, a neuron could fire at maximum level every time a group of four objects is seen, but will fire less to a group three or five objects.

==Pathology==

===Damage to intraparietal sulcus===
Damage done to parietal lobe, specifically in the left hemisphere, can produce difficulties in counting and other simple arithmetic.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Damage directly to the intraparietal sulcus has been shown to cause [[acalculia]], a severe disorder in mathematical cognition.&lt;ref name="cantlon" /&gt;  Symptoms vary based the location of damage, but can include the inability to perform simple calculations or to decide that one number is larger than another.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt; [[Gerstmann syndrome]], a disease resulting in lesions in the left parietal and [[temporal lobe]]s, results in acalculia symptoms and further confirms the importance of the parietal region in the ANS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashkenazi|first=S|title=Basic Numerical Processing in Left Intraparietal Sulcus (IPS) Acalculia.|journal=Cortex|year=2008|volume=44|issue=4|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.08.008|pages=439–448|pmid=18387576}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental delays===
A syndrome known as [[dyscalculia]] is seen in individuals who have unexpected difficulty understanding numbers and arithmetic despite adequate education and social environments.&lt;ref name="molko"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Molko|first=N|title=Functional and structural alterations of the intraparietal sulcus in a developmental dyscalculia of genetic origin|journal=Neuron|year=2003|volume=40|issue=4|doi=10.1016/s0896-6273(03)00670-6|pages=847–858}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This syndrome can manifest in several different ways from the inability to assign a quantity to Arabic numerals to difficulty with times tables.  Dyscalculia can result in children falling significantly behind in school, regardless of having normal intelligence levels.

In some instances, such as [[Turner syndrome]], the onset of dyscalculia is genetic.  Morphological studies have revealed abnormal lengths and depths of the right intraparietal sulcus in individuals suffering from Turner syndrome.&lt;ref name="molko" /&gt;  Brain imaging in children exhibiting symptoms of dyscalculia show less [[gray matter]] or less activation in the intraparietal regions stimulated normally during mathematical tasks.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Additionally, impaired ANS acuity has been shown to differentiate children with dyscalculia from their normally-developing peers with low maths achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mazzocco|first=M.M.M.|author2=Feigenson, L.|author3=Halberda, J.|title=Impaired Acuity of the Approximate Number System Underlies Mathematical Learning Disability(Dyscalculia)|journal=Child Development|year=2011|volume=82|issue=4|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01608.x|pages=1224–1237|pmid=21679173|pmc=4411632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Further research and theories==

===Impact of the visual cortex===
The intraparietal region relies on several other brain systems to accurately perceive numbers.  When using the ANS we must view the sets of objects in order to evaluate their magnitude.  The [[primary visual cortex]] is responsible for disregarding irrelevant information, such as the size or shape of the objects.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;  Certain visual cues can sometimes affect how the ANS functions.

Arranging the items differently can alter the effectiveness of the ANS.  One arrangement proven to influence the ANS is visual nesting, or placing the objects within one another.  This configuration affects the ability to distinguish each item and add them together at the same time.  The difficulty results in underestimation of the magnitude present in the set or a longer amount of time needed to perform an estimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chesney|first=DL|title=Visual Nesting Impacts Approximate Number System Estimation|journal=Attention, Perception, &amp; Psychophysics|year=2012|volume=74|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another visual representation that affects the ANS is the [[Spatial-numerical association of response codes|spatial-numerical association response code]], or the SNARC effect.  The SNARC effect details the tendency of larger numbers to be responded to faster by the right hand and lower numbers by the left hand, suggesting that the magnitude of a number is linked to a spatial representation.&lt;ref name= "ren"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ren|first=P|title=Size matters: non-numerical magnitude affects the spatial coding of response|journal=PLOS ONE|year=2011|volume=6|issue=8|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0023553|pages=e23553|pmid=21853151|pmc=3154948}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dehaene and other researchers believe this effect is caused by the presence of a “mental number line” in which small numbers appear on the left and increase as you move right.&lt;ref name="ren" /&gt;  The SNARC effect indicates that the ANS works more effectively and accurately if the larger set of objects is on the right and the smaller on the left.

===Development and mathematical performance===
Although the ANS is present in infancy before any numerical education, research has shown a link between people's mathematical abilities and the accuracy in which they approximate the magnitude of a set.  This correlation is supported by several studies in which school-aged children's ANS abilities are compared to their mathematical achievements.  At this point the children have received training in other mathematical concepts, such as exact number and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Halberda|first=J|title=Individual differences in non-verbal number acuity correlate with maths achievement|journal=Nature|year=2008|volume=455|issue=7213|doi=10.1038/nature07246|pmid=18776888|pages=665–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More surprisingly, ANS precision before any formal education accurately predicts better math performance.  A study involving 3-5 year old children revealed that ANS acuity corresponds to better mathematical cognition while remaining independent of factors that may interfere, such as reading ability and the use of Arabic numerals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Libertus|first=ME|title=Preschool acuity of the approximate number system correlates with school math ability|journal=Developmental Science|year=2011|volume=14|issue=6|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2011.01080.x|pages=1292–1300|pmc=3338171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ANS in animals===
{{Main|Number sense in animals}}
Many species of animals exhibit the ability to assess and compare magnitude.  This skill is believed to be a product of the ANS.  Research has revealed this capability in both vertebrate and non-vertebrate animals including birds, mammals, fish, and even insects.&lt;ref name= "agrillo"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Agrillo|first=Christian|title=Evidence for Two Numerical Systems That Are Similar in Humans and Guppies|journal=PLoS ONE|year=2012|volume=7|issue=2|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0031923|pages=e31923|pmid=22355405|pmc=3280231}}&lt;/ref&gt; In primates, implications of the ANS have been steadily observed through research.  One study involving lemurs showed that they were able to distinguish groups of objects based only on numerical differences, suggesting that humans and other primates utilize a similar numerical processing mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Merritt|first=Dustin|title=Numerical rule-learning in ring-tailed Lemurs (Lemur catta) |journal=Frontiers in Psychology|year=2011|volume=2|issue=23|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00023 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study comparing students to guppies, both the fish and students performed the numerical task almost identically.&lt;ref name="agrillo" /&gt;    The ability for the test groups to distinguish large numbers was dependent on the ratio between them, suggesting the ANS was involved.  Such results seen when testing guppies indicate that the ANS may have been evolutionarily passed down through many species.&lt;ref name="agrillo" /&gt;

==Applications in society==

===Implications for the classroom===
Understanding how the ANS affects students' learning could be beneficial for teachers and parents.  The following tactics have been suggested by neuroscientists to utilize the ANS in school:&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;
*Counting or abacus games
*Simple board games
*Computer-based number association games
*Teacher sensitivity and different teaching methods for different learners
Such tools are most helpful in training the number system when the child is at an earlier age.  Children coming from a disadvantaged background with risk of arithmetic problems are especially impressionable by these tactics.&lt;ref name="book" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9258">In Western [[music]] and [[music theory]], '''augmentation''' (from [[Late Latin]] ''augmentare'', to increase) is the lengthening of a [[Musical note|note]] or [[Interval (music)|interval]].

Augmentation is a compositional device where a [[melody]], theme or motif is presented in longer note-values than were previously used. Augmentation is also the term for the proportional lengthening of the value of individual note-shapes in older notation by coloration, by use of a sign of proportion, or by a notational symbol such as the modern dot. A major or perfect [[Interval (music)|interval]] that is widened by a chromatic semitone is an augmented interval, and the process may be called augmentation.

==Augmentation in composition==
A melody or series of [[Musical note|note]]s is ''augmented'' if the lengths of the notes are prolonged; augmentation is thus the opposite of [[diminution]], where note values are shortened. A melody originally consisting of four quavers ([[eighth note]]s) for example, is augmented if it later appears with four crotchets ([[quarter note]]s) instead. This technique is often used in [[counterpoint|contrapuntal]] music, as in the "[[canon (music)|canon]] by augmentation" ("''per augmentationem''"), in which the notes in the following voice or voices are longer than those in the leading voice, usually twice the original length.&lt;ref name="Jeppesen"/&gt; The music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] provides examples of this application:[[File:Bach, Vom Himmel Hoch canonic variations, BWV 769, Variation 5.wav|thumb|Bach, Vom Himmel Hoch canonic variations, BWV 769, Variation 5]][[File:Bach, Vom Himmel Hoch canonic variations, BWV 769, Variation 6.png|thumb|center|500px|Bach, Vom Himmel Hoch canonic variations, BWV 769, Variation 5]]
Other ratios of augmentation, such as 1:3 (tripled note values) and 1:4 (quadrupled note values), are also possible.&lt;ref name="Harvard Dictionary"/&gt; A [[motif (music)|motif]] is also augmented through expanding its [[duration (music)|duration]].&lt;ref name="Forte"/&gt;

Augmentation may also be found in later, non-contrapuntal pieces, such as the [[Symphony No. 6 (Beethoven)|Pastoral Symphony]] (Symphony No. 6) of [[Beethoven]], where the melodic figure first heard in the second violins at the start of the "Storm" movement ("''Die Sturm''"):&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;[[File:Pastoral Symphony Storm.wav|thumb|Beethoven Symphony No 6, fourth movement, bars 3-8]][[File:Beethoven Symphony No 6, fourth movement, bars 3-8.png|thumb|center|500px|Beethoven Symphony No 6, fourth movement, bars 3-8]]

-is heard again in an augmented and transposed version in the same movement’s closing ten bars:[[File:Beethoven Symphony No 6, fourth movement, bars 146-155.wav|thumb|Beethoven Symphony No 6, fourth movement, bars 146-155]][[File:Beethoven Symphony No 6, fourth movement, bars 146-155.png|thumb|center|500px|Beethoven Symphony No 6, fourth movement, bars 146-155]]

Examples of augmentation may be found in the [[musical development|development sections]] of [[sonata form]] movements, particularly in the symphonies of [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms]] and [[Anton Bruckner|Bruckner]]&lt;ref name="Harvard Dictionary"/&gt; and in the protean [[leitmotifs]] in [[Wagner]]’s operas, which undergo all kinds of transformation as the characters change and develop through the unfolding drama.  "Leitmotifs accumulate meaning, through expanding and fulfilling their musical potential." &lt;ref&gt;Scruton, R. (2016, p.204) the Ring of Truth: The Wuisdom of Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung." London, Allen Lane.&lt;/ref&gt;

In “Doctor Gradus ad Parnassum”, the first movement of his [[Children's Corner|''Children’s Corner'']] Suite, [[Debussy]] exploits augmentation in a humorous vein. It opens with a vigorous parody of a technical study by a pedagogical composer such as [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]],&lt;ref name="Dawes, F. 1969, p34"&gt;Dawes, F. (1969, p34) Debussy Piano Music.  London, BBC publications.&lt;/ref&gt; involving a seemingly perpetual stream of fast semiquavers:[[File:Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 1-3.wav|thumb|Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 1-3]][[File:Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 1-3.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 1-3]]

In bar 33, this energetic movement subsides, leading to a dreamy passage in the key of D flat, where the opening figures of the piece move at half speed:[[File:Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 36-43.wav|thumb|Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 36-43]][[File:Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 36-43.png|thumb|center|500px|Debussy, "Dr Gradus" from Childrens Corner, bars 36-43]]

According to Frank Dawes, in this piece “An amusing picture of a child practising is conjured up, beginning with the best of intentions, growing weary and plainly yawning with boredom in the D flat section.” &lt;ref name="Dawes, F. 1969, p34"/&gt; [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQOe2s4oDuQ Listen.]

== Augmentation in notation ==

== Augmentation of intervals ==
[[Image:Augmented octave on C.png|thumb|Augmented octave on C. {{audio|Minor ninth on C.mid|Play}}]]

An interval is augmented if it is widened by a [[chromatic semitone]]. Thus an [[augmented fifth]], for example, is a chromatic semitone wider than the [[perfect fifth]]. The standard abbreviations for augmented intervals are AX, such that an augmented third = A3.&lt;ref name="Benward &amp; Saker"/&gt;

A good example of this can be seen in the left hand part of [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin's]] famous E minor prelude [[Opus number|Op]]. 28, No. 4.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  Many of the [[chord progression|chord sequences]] change with the top or bottom note augmenting or diminishing the next chord as the music progresses.

An [[augmented chord]] is one which contains an augmented interval, almost invariably the 5th of the chord. An [[augmented triad]] is a [[Major chord|major triad]] whose fifth has been raised by a chromatic semitone; it is the principal harmony of the [[whole tone scale]].{{-}}

'''Black Rock Forest''' is a {{convert|3870|acre|km2|adj=on}}&lt;ref name="About the forest"&gt;{{cite web |title=About the Forest |url=http://blackrockforest.org/about-1 |accessdate=August 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; forest and biological field station maintained by Black Rock Forest Consortium. It is located in the western [[Hudson Highlands]] region of the [[U.S. state]] of New York, in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]], mostly in the [[Administrative divisions of New York#Town|town]] of [[Cornwall, New York|Cornwall]], with the southern fringe overlapping into the neighboring town of [[Highlands, New York|Highlands]].

First established by a local resident in 1928, the forest was the property of [[Harvard University]] until 1989. The Consortium has invested heavily in facilities to not only improve its research and educational missions but promote [[sustainability]], erecting several [[green building]]s in the middle of the forest with guest facilities, classrooms and laboratories. Its educational facilities are used by groups at every level, from the primary [[elementary education|elementary]] [[grade level|grades]] to college undergraduates. Over 400 papers have been published from research done in the forest.

==History==

The current forest began to grow about 14,000 years ago, with the [[Holocene glacial retreat|retreat]] of the [[glacier]]s at the end of the [[Wisconsin glaciation|last Ice Age]]. Originally, like many post-glacial forests, it consisted of [[evergreen]] [[conifer]]s such as [[spruce]] and [[fir]], but as the climate warmed they gave way to the [[deciduous]] species of [[oak]] and maple that now predominate.&lt;ref name="forest history"&gt;{{cite web |title=Forest History |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-forest/ForestHistory.html |accessdate=January 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509142826/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-forest/ForestHistory.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like much of the Highlands, the land now part of Black Rock had been heavily impacted by human usage. [[Native Americans in the United States|Native]] communities hunted the forest extensively, built large settlements and started [[forest fire]]s to clear sections of the woods and prevent larger natural ones. After [[European colonization of the Americas|colonization]] of the [[Hudson Valley]] in 1690, the impact becomes more evident to the contemporary eye.&lt;ref name="forest history" /&gt; During the last years of the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]] the [[Continental Army]] used the Continental Road that runs through the center of the property to get between [[West Point]] and its [[New Windsor Cantonment State Historic Site|encampment]] at [[New Windsor, New York|New Windsor]]. Spy Rock got its name from its use by Continental soldiers as a lookout point where they could monitor [[Newburgh Bay]] for any signs of British activity on the strategically important [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name="Revolutionary history"&gt;{{cite book |title=New York Walk Book |year=1998 |edition=Seventh|publisher=[[New York - New Jersey Trail Conference]] |location= [[Mahwah, New Jersey|Mahwah, NJ]] |isbn=1-880775-30-1 |page=312 |others=Illustrations by Robert L. Dickinson and Jack Fagan.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 19th century it saw extensive [[logging]] and mining, with some homesteads and farms established in its lower-lying portions. Only one building, the 1834 Chatsfield stone house, remains today.&lt;ref name="forest history" /&gt; As the forest land began to decline in value with the depletion of its productive resources, various tracts were bought by the Stillman family in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In 1928, enough land had been acquired for Dr. Ernest Stillman to officially create Black Rock Forest for research and demonstration purposes. He hoped to restore it to productive use again through newly developed practical [[forestry]] techniques, as well as leaving plenty of undisturbed land available for use in [[silviculture|silvicultural]] research.&lt;ref name="forest history" /&gt;

To this end he hired a forester, Hal Tryon, and a small crew to cull unwanted species and poorly growing trees from wanted ones. The forest improved considerably, and upon his death in 1949 Stillman [[bequest|left]] the forest to his ''[[alma mater]]'', [[Harvard University]], for the continuation of its purposes. During Harvard's ownership of the forest, 75 [[Academic publishing#Scholarly paper|scientific papers]] were published based on research in it.&lt;ref name="forest history" /&gt; [[Hiking]] [[trail]]s were also developed in the forest under the auspices of the [[New York - New Jersey Trail Conference]]. During the late 1960s and 1970s the Forest faced its biggest threat, as a massive power plant proposed for nearby [[Storm King Mountain (New York)|Storm King Mountain]] by [[Consolidated Edison]] would have flooded most of it to build a large [[reservoir (water)|reservoir]]. That plan was eventually abandoned in 1982 after a landmark environmental lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Storm King suit"&gt;''Ibid.'', 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Harvard also owns the eponymous forest closer to campus in [[Petersham, Massachusetts]], in 1981 it asked another alumnus, William Golden, what he thought should be done with Black Rock. He suggested that there were plenty of local organizations which might be able to derive the same benefit from it, and approached them about forming a [[consortium]] or similar group to take over from Harvard. Many were enthusiastic about the idea but lacked enough funds to contribute even a share of the purchase price. Golden decided to purchase the land himself in 1989 and give it to a newly created Black Rock Forest Preserve, which in turn leases it to the Black Rock Forest Consortium. Harvard donated the purchase price to the forest as the beginning of an [[Financial endowment|endowment]], and Golden added to that with more of his own money.&lt;ref name="consortium history"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Consortium |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-consortium/history.html |accessdate=January 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206061035/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-consortium/history.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

The forest is nestled in an area roughly bounded by [[U.S. Route 9W|US 9W]] to the east and Angola Road (which it does not reach) on the north. To the southwest, a small portion, the former Mineral Springs Nature Preserve, protrudes to a public access point on Old Mineral Springs Road. A large tract along the western boundary, and a smaller one to the east, are designated as ecological reserves within the forest.&lt;ref name="forest map"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/Black_Rock_GIS_Map.pdf |title= Black Rock GIS Map |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518111215/http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/Black_Rock_GIS_Map.pdf |archivedate= May 18, 2008 |df= mdy-all }} &amp;nbsp;{{small|(72.4&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, retrieved January 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mineral Springs Falls in Black Rock Forest, NY.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Mineral Springs Falls]]
Most public access comes from Route 9W, near the lowest portions of the land, and many of the research and educational facilities are located in that north central area. To the south, in the Highlands portion of the forest, the land rises over a thousand feet (300 m) to several peaks, including the eponymous 1,402-foot (427 m) Black Rock with its [[observation tower]] and Spy Rock, at 1,463 feet (446 m)&lt;ref name="forest map" /&gt; the highest point in the Town of Highlands and the highest peak in the Highlands west of the [[Hudson River]].&lt;ref name="Geology" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Schunemunk explanation"&gt;[[Schunemunk Mountain]], Orange County's highest peak at 1,664 feet (507 m), while located a short distance to the west, is geologically distinct from the Highlands and not considered part of them.&lt;/ref&gt; There are seven ponds in the forest,&lt;ref name="forest map" /&gt; all of which form part of the village of [[Cornwall on Hudson]]'s [[water supply system]] save Sutherland Pond, the only one in which visitors are allowed to swim.&lt;ref name="usage policies"&gt;{{cite web |title=Usage Policies |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-forest/UsagePolicies.html |accessdate=January 26, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509161438/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-forest/UsagePolicies.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ponds drain into an unnamed stream that crosses the village and empties into [[Moodna Creek]] near where it joins the Hudson; Sutherland gives rise to [[Mineral Springs Brook]], which flows out to the scenic Mineral Springs Falls near the western end of the forest and then to Moodna Creek's main tributary, [[Woodbury Creek]].

The forest is buffered by other, nearby [[protected area]]s in two directions, with [[Storm King State Park]] on the east across Route 9W and the large [[United States Military Academy]] reservation directly to the south. In other directions the large, minimally developed tracts of private landowners serve as a buffer.&lt;ref name="forest map" /&gt;

===Roads and trails===

A network of old logging and mining roads, including the Continental Road, still exists and provides access to many points in the central region of the park. They are closed to all motor-vehicle use save that authorized by the consortium for its members;&lt;ref name="usage policies" /&gt; they are open to bicycles and foot traffic and [[trail blazing|marked]] as part of the forest's trail system.

Together with cut footpaths, the roads provide over 30 miles (50&amp;nbsp;km) of trails in Black Rock Forest.&lt;ref name="trail mileage"&gt;''New York Walk Book'', 313&lt;/ref&gt; Most are short routes between the roads and other trails or spurs to various overlooks running less than two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) in total length. The two exceptions are the Scenic and Stillman trails, backbone routes across the park in different directions, both also carrying the long-distance [[Highlands Trail]] for all or most of their lengths.

The Scenic Trail, the longest in the forest at 5.9 miles (9.5&amp;nbsp;km), runs from its western [[trailhead]] on Old Mineral Springs Road near the falls atop the ridge past Spy Rock to end at a junction with the Stillman near Mount Misery.&lt;ref name="Scenic Trail"&gt;''Ibid.'', 317-18.&lt;/ref&gt; The Stillman Trail, named for the forest's founder, is actually a continuation of a trail that begins in Cornwall on Hudson and goes over Storm King, then crosses 9W into the forest. It runs 5.3 miles (8.5&amp;nbsp;km) across the forest and over Black Rock to end at an overlook to [[Schunemunk Mountain]] and [[Mountainville, New York|Mountainville]] near the forest's western boundary.&lt;ref name="Stillman Trail"&gt;''Ibid.'', 319-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==

The forest is one of the northernmost sections of the [[New York-New Jersey Highlands|Highlands Province]] of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The [[Precambrian]] [[gneiss]] [[bedrock]] in the forest is the oldest in New York State, formed 1.1 billion-1.3 billion years ago and first uplifted during the [[Taconic Orogeny]] 460 million-440 million years ago. The [[Acadian Orogeny|Acadian]] and [[Alleghenian Orogeny|Alleghenian]] orogenies further shaped the mountains to their present form, and then the glaciers and erosion wore them down.&lt;ref name="Geology" /&gt;

Within the gneiss can be found several other minerals: [[feldspar]], [[quartz]], [[pyroxene]] and [[mica]]. Black bands within the bedrock come from the mineral that gave the forest its name: [[magnetite]], a source of iron. Two [[Aviation accidents and incidents|plane crashes]] on the Hill of Pines, less than 600 feet (180 m) apart, are believed to have occurred because of the mineral's influence on the aircraft [[compass]]es.&lt;ref name="Geology" /&gt;

==Biological resources==
Black Rock Forest's flora and fauna are part of the [[Northeastern coastal forests]] [[ecoregion]].&lt;ref name="terrestrial"&gt;{{cite journal |author = Olson, D. M |author2=E. Dinerstein |title = Terrestrial Ecoregions of the World: A New Map of Life on Earth |journal = [[BioScience]] |year = 2001 |volume=51 |issue=11 |pages= 933–938 |url = http://worldwildlife.org/science/wildfinder/ |doi = 10.1641/0006-3568(2001)051[0933:TEOTWA]2.0.CO;2 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora===
[[Botany|Botanists]] working in the forest have identified several distinct plant communities, including 60 species of tree,&lt;ref name="tree list"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/TreeSpeciesList.pdf |title= Trees of Black Rock Forest |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518095751/http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/TreeSpeciesList.pdf |archivedate= May 18, 2008 |df= mdy-all }} &amp;nbsp;{{small|(114&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, retrieved January 26, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; within it, spread among six different regions. The most widespread is an [[oak]] forest found in the drier lowlands, where red oak, the most common [[canopy (forest)|canopy]] tree on the property, predominates along with maples, hickory and [[Betula lenta|black birch]]. Some [[chestnut]]s, once the dominant canopy tree before the [[chestnut blight]], survive as well. [[Shrub]]s include [[Kalmia latifolia|mountain laurel]] and [[witch-hazel]].&lt;ref name="flora and fauna"&gt;''Ibid.'', 310-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same trees can also be found in the [[wetlands]]. More associate species show up, particularly [[sugar maple]], as well as [[beech]], [[basswood]] and [[Liquidambar|sweetgum]]. The [[understory]] add [[ironwood]], [[striped maple]] and [[spicebush]]. In flooded areas, [[red maple]] and [[alder]], which can tolerate the water, are dominant along with [[leatherleaf]] and [[sphagnum]]. A few [[gray birch]] are found along the edges of ponds, and [[eastern hemlock]] can be found along some of the streams, cooling the water with its shade.&lt;ref name="flora and fauna" /&gt;

Higher up the ridges, as the soils thin, the dominant oaks are the [[chestnut oak|chestnut]] and scrub oak varieties found on most montane sites in the Highlands. [[Pitch pine]] cannot flourish anywhere else in the forest except in the thin soils found here, and on the bare rocks sensitive [[lichen]]s, [[moss]]es and [[grass]]es take hold where they can.&lt;ref name="flora and fauna" /&gt;

A 2003 study by the [[Brooklyn Botanical Garden]] identified 688 species of [[vascular plant]]s in the forest over an eight-year period.

===Fauna===

As in other [[woodland]]s in the Eastern United States, [[white-tailed deer]] are the most abundant [[mammal]] within Black Rock Forest, providing ample hunting opportunities. Common associate species like [[fox]]es, [[mink]], [[striped skunk]]s and [[raccoon]]s are also common, as are [[rodent]] species like [[squirrel]]s, [[chipmunk]]s and [[vole]]s. Some [[bat]] species also have taken up residence.&lt;ref name="Mammals"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/MammalsSpeciesList.pdf |title= Mammal Species List |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518095711/http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/MammalsSpeciesList.pdf |archivedate= May 18, 2008 |df= mdy-all }} &amp;nbsp;{{small|(18.0&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Retrieved January 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coyote]]s have made a comeback since 1985, and there have been signs of [[beaver]] activity although the animals themselves have rarely been seen.&lt;ref name="flora and fauna" /&gt;

Many [[reptile]]s and [[amphibian]]s common to Eastern forests are well represented. These include several [[salamander]] species, a few [[frog]]s, the [[American toad]], and the [[Terrapene carolina carolina|Eastern box]] and [[painted turtle|painted]] [[turtle]]s. Some poisonous snakes have been found, although [[garter snake]]s and other non-hazardous species are more common.&lt;ref name="reptiles and amphibians"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/ReptilesAmphibiansSpeciesList.pdf |title= Reptiles and Amphibians List |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080518095647/http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/ReptilesAmphibiansSpeciesList.pdf |archivedate= May 18, 2008 |df= mdy-all }} &amp;nbsp;{{small|(229&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Retrieved January 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Woodland birds like [[ruffed grouse]] and [[wild turkey]] are dominant among avian species, with [[Canada goose|Canada geese]] and [[mallard duck]]s conspicuous in and near the ponds. Smaller birds include the [[downy woodpecker|downy]] and [[hairy woodpecker|hairy]] [[woodpecker]]s. All are prey for common [[predator]] species like the [[red-tailed hawk]], [[Cooper's hawk]] and [[barred owl]].&lt;ref name="Bird list"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/BirdSpeciesList.pdf |title= Bird Species List |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170720/http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/BirdSpeciesList.pdf |archivedate= July 25, 2008 |df= mdy-all }} &amp;nbsp;{{small|(62.7&amp;nbsp;KB)}}, Retrieved January 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most insect species have not been formally counted. The [[American Museum of Natural History]], a consortium member, has counted 296 [[spider]] species in the forest as of 2005,&lt;ref name="AMNH spider count"&gt;{{cite web |title=A List of Spiders |url=http://research.amnh.org/entomology/blackrock2/check_list.htm |year=2005 |accessdate=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the following year a Harvard study found 33 [[ant]] species and projected a possible 58 in the forest.&lt;ref name="ants"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ellison |first=Aaron |author2=Record, Sydne |author3=Arguello, Alexander |author4=Gotelli, Nicholas J. |date=August 2007 |title=Rapid Inventory of the Ant Assemblage in a Temperate Hardwood Forest: Species Composition and Assessment of Sampling Methods |journal=Environmental Entomology |volume=36 |issue=4 |page=10 |id= |url=http://esa.publisher.ingentaconnect.com/content/esa/envent/2007/00000036/00000004/art00014 |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |quote=A total of 33 species in 14 genera were collected and identified ...

==Management==

Black Rock Forest is run on a daily basis by a staff of ten headed by Executive Director, Dr. William Schuster.&lt;ref name="Staff"&gt;{{cite web |title=Staff |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-consortium/staff.html |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118044154/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-consortium/staff.html |archivedate=January 18, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; They report to the consortium's [[board of trustees|board]], which is composed of six officers, a representative of each member organization, 13 directors-at-large and the seven members of the Black Rock Forest Preserve board. It is currently chaired by Sibyl Golden, who also edits ''Black Rock Forest News'', the consortium's quarterly [[newsletter]]. Columbia professor Kevin Griffin serves as president.&lt;ref name="board"&gt;{{cite web |title=Board |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-consortium/Board.html |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725170950/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/the-consortium/board.html |archivedate=July 25, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land usage===

The forest is free and open to the public daily for hiking and mountain biking, but within strict rules in order to preserve its value as a research and educational facility. No motor vehicles other than those authorized by the forest are allowed on its roads, and then only within a 10&amp;nbsp;mph (16&amp;nbsp;km/h) [[speed limit]]. The forest closes at dusk daily; no [[camping]] is permitted except for occasional [[Leave No Trace|light-impact]] stays. Research plots, when clearly marked, are not to be disturbed.&lt;ref name="usage policies" /&gt;

Hikers are asked to stay on marked trails and refrain from [[Bushwhacker|bushwhacking]]. Swimming and [[angling|fishing]] are permitted only in Sutherland Pond and Mineral Springs Brook. Only members of the Black Rock Fish and Game Club are allowed to [[hunting|hunt]] in the forest during New York State [[firearm]] deer season in late fall;&lt;ref name="usage policies" /&gt; the forest is closed to the public during that period.&lt;ref name="flora and fauna" /&gt;

===Facilities===

During the Stillman and Harvard eras, the forest administration worked out of what is now known as the Old Forest Headquarters, on Continental Avenue, just across Route 9W from one of the main access points. It can still house 15 guests. It also has a lawn for recreational activities, a tree and shrub [[Nursery (horticulture)|nursery]], [[weather station]], storage barn and woodshop.&lt;ref name="Facilities"&gt;{{cite web |title=Facilities and Resources |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/Facilities-and-Resources/index.html |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121184445/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/Facilities-and-Resources/index.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Consortium took over, it decided to build several facilities to allow education and research to take place in the forest itself, the first new construction in the forest since the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Facilities" /&gt; All are [[green building]]s, in keeping with the forest's mission,&lt;ref name="Green buildings"&gt;{{cite web |title=Green building and smart features |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/GreenBuildings/index.html |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121184450/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/GreenBuildings/index.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; that have won their architects some awards.&lt;ref name="awards"&gt;{{cite web |title=Awards |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/GreenBuildings/Awards.html |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206054719/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/GreenBuildings/Awards.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main building is the Center for Science and Education, a 9,000-square foot (810 m²) structure erected in 1999&lt;ref name="awards" /&gt; with [[grant (money)|grant]]s from the [[National Science Foundation]], [[Kresge Foundation]] and other donors. It has a wet and dry [[laboratory]], 1,150 square feet (104 m²) of classrooms (with labs of their own) designed for levels from [[kindergarten]] through undergraduate, and space for up to 60 visitors to stay overnight. The 700-square foot (63 m²) dry lab also has [[refrigerator]]s, [[freezer]]s, [[centrifuge]]s, distilled water and a [[fume hood]]. [[Archive]]d data from forest research and observation goes back to 1930 in some cases.&lt;ref name="Data resources"&gt;{{cite web |title=Data Resources |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/scientist-resources/DataResources/index.html |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206055037/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/scientist-resources/DataResources/index.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wired and [[wireless Internet|wireless]] Internet access is available.&lt;ref name="Spaces for learning"&gt;{{cite web |title=Spaces for Learning |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/teacher-student-resources/EducationalResources/Spaces.html |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206055457/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/teacher-student-resources/EducationalResources/Spaces.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next to the Center is the Forest Lodge, built in 2005 as the primary center for overnight stays in the Forest. Sixty people can spend the night here, sleeping four to eight to a room. A central Commons can accommodate 140 for lectures and 65 for meals prepared in the kitchen, and the deck offers a view of the surrounding mountains.&lt;ref name="Forest Lodge"&gt;{{cite web|title=Forest Lodge|url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/teacher-student-resources/HousingResources/ForestLodge.html|accessdate=January 29, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206060617/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/teacher-student-resources/HousingResources/ForestLodge.html|archivedate=December 6, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third building in this main complex is the [[solar energy|Solar]] Pavilion, on a small rise behind the Science Center. It is an unwalled shelter built of [[red pine]] harvested within the forest. Its 32 [[Photovoltaic module|solar panels]] on its sloping, south-facing roof, which when combined with 48 more on the Center for Science and Education provided 26,000 [[kilowatt hour]]s of electricity in their first 11 months of operation, about half the building's total demand. During daylight in summer it can provide all the building's power.&lt;ref name="Solar panels"&gt;{{cite web |title=Solar panels |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/GreenBuildings/SolarPanels.html |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071206055819/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/GreenBuildings/SolarPanels.html |archivedate=December 6, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Underneath the roof are two large picnic tables and real-time monitors for the solar power system to allow the Pavilion's use as an outdoor classroom.&lt;ref name="Facilities" /&gt;

Away from this complex are two other buildings. The 1834 Chatsfield Stone House, located along the Continental Road between Arthurs and Tamarack ponds, the only remaining structure from the area's past uses, was rebuilt after a 1912 fire and is now a museum. Its exhibits relate not only to the past human uses of the forest but to its natural history, and include a short nearby interpretive trail designed to teach tree identification. Some educational programs are based here, and it too can be used for overnight stays (albeit without electricity or running water) with forest permission.&lt;ref name="Facilities" /&gt;

===Programs and projects===

The consortium runs several regular programs and projects in conjunction with its member institutions. A Small Grants program, funded by the [[Ernst C. Stiefel Foundation]], has been in place since 1990, continuing a similar practice of Harvard's.&lt;ref name="Small Grants"&gt;{{cite web |title=Small Grants |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/scientist-resources/SmallGrants/index.html |accessdate=January 29, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209093133/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/scientist-resources/SmallGrants/index.html |archivedate=December 9, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Teachers and researchers at member institutions are eligible for up to $3,000 for educational projects and $5,000 for research projects. A total of $425,000 has been given out since then.&lt;ref name="Grants to date"&gt;{{cite web |title=Grants Given to Date |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/scientist-resources/SmallGrants/GrantstoDate.html |accessdate=January 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509165236/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/scientist-resources/SmallGrants/GrantstoDate.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The School in the Forest program, funded initially by a grant from the [[New York Community Trust]], brings students from urban public schools in New York City to the forest for day or overnight trips to get the same experience the consortium's member schools and school districts enjoy for their students. Currently P.S 220 in the [[Mott Haven, Bronx|Mott Haven]] section of the [[Bronx]] and P.S/I.S 311 from [[Inwood, Manhattan|Inwood]], the northern tip of [[Manhattan]] Island, are participating.&lt;ref name="School in the Forest"&gt;{{cite web |title=School in the Forest |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/schoolintheforest/index.html |accessdate=January 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071121184515/http://www.blackrockforest.org/docs/about-the-forest/schoolintheforest/index.html |archivedate=November 21, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The weekend of April 29, 2011, the Marine Biology Research Program of the Urban Assembly [[New York Harbor School]] headed to Black Rock Forest to take part in ecosystem ecology projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newyorkharborschool.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Newsletter-Spring-2011.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531205134/http://newyorkharborschool.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/Newsletter-Spring-2011.pdf |archivedate=May 31, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990s, Jean Gardner, a consortium consultant, began putting together a Virtual Forest Initiative, a new concept designed to take advantage of the possibilities of the then-emerging [[World Wide Web]]. It would not only allow visitors to take a "virtual hike" through the forest, it would also provide real-time data from the forest's environmental monitoring network to enhance appreciation of its ecological importance.&lt;ref name="Virtual Forest Initiative"&gt;{{cite news |last=Muschamp |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Muschamp |title= ARCHITECTURE VIEW;In Cyberspace, Seeing the Forest for the Trees |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/25/arts/architecture-view-in-cyberspace-seeing-the-forest-for-the-trees.html?sq=Black+Rock+Forest+Muschamp&amp;scp=1&amp;st=nyt |newspaper=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=February 25, 1996 |accessdate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004 a virtual hike with data was made available,&lt;ref name="NASA virtual hike"&gt;{{cite web |title=Black Rock Forest Virtual Hike |url=http://icp.giss.nasa.gov/education/modules/carbon/topic1/ |date=April 2004 |accessdate=January 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to the clickable map on the Consortium's website.&lt;ref name="clickable map"&gt;{{cite web |title=Clickable Map |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/html-files/imagemap.html |accessdate=January 30, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509142133/http://www.blackrockforest.org/html-files/imagemap.html |archivedate=May 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first "Green Ride", a three-day, 260-mile (418&amp;nbsp;km) [[bicycling]] trip from [[Fort Tryon Park]] in Manhattan to the forest and back, was held in October 2007.&lt;ref name="Green Ride"&gt;{{cite journal |title=The 'Green Ride' Raises $48,000 for Forest Education Programs |journal=Black Rock Forest News |volume=XVIII |issue=1 |page=1 |date=Winter 2008 |url=http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/Newsletter-Winter2008.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=January 31, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512000953/http://www.blackrockforest.org/pdf-files/Newsletter-Winter2008.pdf |archivedate=May 12, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was successful in raising $60,000 for forest programs and will be held again in 2008.&lt;ref name="Green Ride 2008"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Green Ride |url=http://www.thegreenride.org/ |accessdate=January 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
Most access to Black Rock Forest comes from Route 9W to the east, where there are three separate parking areas along the southbound roadway of the [[divided highway]]. The main entrance and [[parking lot]] is on Reservoir Road near [[Storm King School]] and [[Cornwall on Hudson]]'s Deer Hill section. From there it is a half-mile (1&amp;nbsp;km) via trail or road to the Center for Science and Education. A mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) north of that is the entrance opposite the old headquarters building on Continental Road, with more limited parking, and several miles to the south, just north of the USMA property, there is another small parking lot aside 9W.&lt;ref name="clickable map" /&gt;

Three other entry points exist. From the south, along [[New York State Route 293|NY 293]] a mile south of Route 9W, a trail from the end of a short road leads from the military reservation into the forest. On the northwest side, there is another trailhead near the end of Mine Hill Road, a dead-end street off Angola Road, and finally there is the access from Old Mineral Springs Road at the western corner.&lt;ref name="clickable map" /&gt;

'''Bloodstain Pattern Analysis''' ('''BPA'''), one of several specialties in the field of [[forensic science]], involves the study and analysis of [[blood]]stains at a known or suspected violent crime scene with the goal of helping investigators draw conclusions about the nature, timing and other details of the crime.

The use of [[Blood residue|bloodstains as evidence]] is not new; however, new experts have claimed to be able to use [[fluid dynamics]], [[physics]], and other calculations to determine with accuracy previous events at a crime scene.  For example, the shape of blood droplets might be used to draw conclusions as to how far away the victim was from a gun when they were shot.

This technique of forensic science has drawn more skeptical scrutiny since 2000; large amounts of the body of work in BPA is done by crime investigators using subjective hunches rather than scientists from other disciplines.  A report released by [[The National Academy of Sciences]] in 2009 highlighted several incidents of blood spatter analysts to overstate their qualifications as well as questioned the reliability of their methods in the courtroom.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite news|last=Moore|first=Solomon|title=Science found wanting in nation's crime labs|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/05/us/05forensics.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Bloodstain pattern analysis has been used informally for centuries, but the first modern study of blood stains was in 1895. Dr. Eduard Piotrowski of the University of Kraków published a paper titled "On the formation, form, direction, and spreading of blood stains after blunt trauma to the head."&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Piotrowski, ''Ueber Entstehung, Form, Richtung und Ausbreitung der Blutspuren nach Hiebwunden des Kopfes'' [On the formation, form, direction, and spreading of blood stains after blunt trauma to the head] (Vienna, Austria:  1895).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="police science" /&gt; A number of publications describing various aspects of blood stains were published, but his publication did not lead to a systematic analysis. LeMoyne Snyder's widely used book ''Homicide Investigation'' (first published in 1941 and updated occasionally through at least the 1970s) also briefly mentioned details that later bloodstain experts would expand upon (e.g., that blood dries at a relatively predictable rate; that arterial blood is a brighter red color than other blood; that bloodstains tend to fall in certain patterns based on the motion of an attacker and victim).&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, LeMoyne (1971). ''Homicide Investigation: Practical Information for Coroners, Police Officers, and Other Investigators''. Charles C. Thompson Publishers, 3rd Edition&lt;/ref&gt; A 1952 episode of the [[police procedural]] radio series ''[[Dragnet (radio series)|Dragnet]]'' made reference to bloodstain pattern analysis to reconstruct a shooting incident.&lt;ref&gt;"Judging from the bloodstains found on the furniture and rug in the living room, and on the front steps of the cottage, Radford had been first been shot while he was in the living room..." Quote starts at about 12 minutes and 17 seconds into the episode. "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZDoe9g6yOLk The Big Streetcar]", April 3, 1952; no script writer identified.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second modern origin of the study of bloodstain pattern analysis is the [[Sam Sheppard]] case in 1954, when the wife of an osteopathic physician was beaten to death in her home. Further growth of interest and use of the significance of bloodstain evidence is a direct result of the scientific research and practical applications of bloodstain theory by Herbert Leon MacDonell of Corning, New York. His research resulted in his publication of the first modern treatise on bloodstain analysis, entitled "Flight Characteristics and Stain Patterns of Human Blood" (1971).

The first formal bloodstain training course was given by MacDonnel in 1973 in Jackson, Mississippi. In 1983, the [[International Association of Bloodstain Pattern Analysts]] was founded by a group of blood stain analysts to help develop the emerging field of bloodstain pattern analysis.&lt;ref name="police science"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brodbeck|first=Silke|title=Introduction to bloodstain pattern analysis|journal=Journal for Police Science and Practice|date=2012|volume=2|pages=51–57|doi=10.7396/IE_2012_E|url=http://www.bmi.gv.at/cms/BMI_SIAK/4/2/1/ie2012/files/Brodbeck_IE_2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blood==
Blood is a tissue that is circulated within the body to assist other parts of the body. This connective tissue has specialized cells that allow it to carry out its complex functions. For a healthy person, approximately 8% of their total weight is blood. For a 70&amp;nbsp;kg (154&amp;nbsp;lb.) individual, this equates to 5.6&amp;nbsp;L (12 US pints).

===Biological considerations===
Blood contains three components or blood cells that are suspended within [[Blood plasma|plasma]]. The three components are erythrocytes, leukocytes, and trombocytes.

*''Erythrocytes'', also known as red blood cells, are transporters.  The role of erythrocytes is to transport oxygen. To do this, they contain great quantities of hemoglobin, which carry oxygen molecules and give blood its distinct red colour.  Blood that has passed through the heart and been oxygenated (oxygenated blood travels through the arteries) tends to have a brighter shade of red as opposed to blood that is returning to the heart (in the veins). There are about 30 trillion erythrocytes circulating in the human blood at any given time.
*''Leukocytes'', also known as white blood cells, are the body's defenders. The role of leukocytes is to defend against harmful bacteria, viruses and microorganisms. There are five different types of leukocytes. They all have different sizes, shapes, structures, and functions.  Leukocytes fight infection and disease. There are about 430 billion leukocytes circulating in the human blood at any given time (~1 per 700 erythrocytes). Pus is made up of leukocytes left in an affected area during and after fighting harmful substances or organisms that infect the body.
*''Platelets'' are formed in the bone marrow. These particular blood cells contain cytoplasm and are enclosed by a membrane, but do not have a nucleus. They play a major role in hemostasis (control of bleeding) by plugging up a breach in a vessel. They are important for forming blood clots. If a person has an abnormally low platelet count, a condition known as thrombocytopenia, blood clots more slowly.

Plasma is the yellowish fluid that carries the erythrocytes, leukocytes, and platelets. It is composed of water (92%), proteins (7%), and other materials such as salts, waste, and hormones, among others. Many of these proteins are clotting factors, which are important along with platelets for forming blood clots; clotting factor deficiencies can cause prolonged and excessive bleeding, a condition called hemophilia. Plasma makes up about 55% of blood. The remaining 45% is the blood cells.  Because plasma is less dense than the blood cells, it can be easily separated. Plasma does not separate from blood cells whilst circulating in the bloodstream because it is in a constant state of agitation.

===Chemical considerations===
Upon exiting the body, bloodstains transit from bright red to dark brown, which is attributed to oxidation of [[Hemoglobin|oxy-hemoglobin]] (HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to [[methemoglobin]] (met-Hb) and [[hemichrome]] (HC). The fractions of HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, met-Hb and HC in a bloodstain can be used for age determination of bloodstains and can be measured by Reflectance Spectroscopy 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021845|title=Biphasic Oxidation of Oxy-Hemoglobin in Bloodstains|first1=Rolf H.|last1=Bremmer|first2=Daniel M. de|last2=Bruin|first3=Maarten de|last3=Joode|first4=Wybren Jan|last4=Buma|first5=Ton G. van|last5=Leeuwen|first6=Maurice C. G.|last6=Aalders|date=15 July 2011|publisher=|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=6|issue=7|pages=e21845|via=PLoS Journals|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0021845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''In vivo'' hemoglobin molecules are mainly present in two forms: one without oxygen, de-oxyhemoglobin (Hb) and one saturated with oxygen, oxy-hemoglobin (HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), both have iron in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; state. HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can auto-oxidize into met-Hb, which contains iron in the Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; state. Met-Hb is incapable of binding oxygen. When met-Hb is formed in vivo it will be reduced back to Hb by reductase protein cytochrome b5, resulting in a small part (&lt;1%) of met-Hb in a healthy in vivo situation.
*''Outside the body'' hemoglobin saturates completely with oxygen in the ambient environment to HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Due to a decreasing availability of [[cytochrome b5]], necessary for reduction of met-Hb, the transition of HbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; into met-Hb will, in contrast to inside the body, no longer be reversed. Once hemoglobin is autooxidized to met-Hb it will denature to hemichrome (HC), which is formed by an internal conformation change to the heme group.

===Physical considerations===
In physics there are two [[Continuum mechanics|continuous physical]] states of matter, solid and fluid. Once blood has left the body it behaves as a fluid and all physical laws apply.

*''Gravity'' acts on blood (without the body's influence) as soon as it exits the body.  Given the right circumstances blood can act according to ballistic theory.
*''Viscosity'' is the amount of internal friction in the fluid.  It describes the resistance of a liquid to flow.
*''[[Surface tension]]'' is the force that maintains the shape of a drop of liquid, such as blood.  When two fluids are in contact with each other (blood and air) there are forces attracting all molecules to each other.

==Blood spatter flight characteristics==
Experiments with blood have shown that a drop of blood tends to form into a sphere in flight rather than the artistic teardrop shape.  This is what one would expect of a fluid in [[free fall|freefall]]. The formation of the sphere is a result of [[surface tension]] that binds the molecules together.

This spherical shape of [[Fluid dynamics|blood in flight]] is important for the calculation of the angle of impact (incidence) of blood spatter when it hits a surface. That angle will be used to determine the point from which the blood originated which is called the Point of Origin or more appropriately the Area of Origin.

A single spatter of blood is not enough to determine the Area of Origin at a crime scene. The determination of the angles of impact and placement of the Area of Origin should be based on the consideration of a number of stains and preferably stains from opposite sides of the pattern to create the means to triangulate.

== Determining angles of impact ==
As mentioned earlier, a blood droplet in freefall has the shape of an oscillating sphere.  Should the droplet strike a surface and a well-formed stain is produced, an analyst can determine the angle at which this droplet struck the surface.  This is based on the relationship between the length of the major axis, minor axis, and the angle of impact.

A well-formed stain is in the shape of an ellipse (see figure 1).  Dr. Victor Balthazard, and later Dr. Herbert Leon MacDonell, realized that the width-length ratio of the ellipse is the [[sine]] of the impact angle.  Accurate measurement of the stain thus allows easy calculation of the impact angle.

[[Image:BPA ellipse example.png|thumb|Fig. 1 Upward moving bloodstain showing proper ellipse placement|left]]
[[Image:BPA AOI.png|thumb|Fig. 2 Angles of Impact|left]]
{{Clear}}

===Angles of impact===

Because of the three-dimensional aspect of trajectories there are three angles of impact:
* '''alpha''' (&amp;alpha;), the impact angle of the bloodstain path moving out from the surface (see figure 2 with alpha at the top by the stain).
* '''beta''' (&amp;beta;), the angle of the bloodstain path pivoting about the vertical (z) axis (see figure 2 with beta extended to the floor).
* '''gamma''' (&amp;gamma;), the angle of the bloodstain path measured from the true vertical (plumb) of the surface (see figure 2 showing plumb line and extended angle from stain).  
All three angles are related through the following [[trigonometry|trigonometric]] equations:

:&lt;math&gt;\sin \alpha = \left( \frac{w}{l} \right)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tan \beta = \frac {\tan \alpha}{\sin \gamma} &lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{l}&lt;/math&gt; = length of ellipse (major axis)
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w}&lt;/math&gt; = width of ellipse (minor axis)

Accurately measuring the stain and calculating the angle of impact requires due diligence of the analyst.  In the past analysts have used a variety of instruments.  Methods currently used include:

*Viewing loupe with an embedded scale in 0.2&amp;nbsp;mm increments or better that is placed over the stain.  The analyst then uses a scientific calculator or spreadsheet to complete the angle calculations.
*Bloodstain Pattern Analysis (BPA) software that superimposes an ellipse over a scaled close-up image of an individual bloodstain, then automatically calculates the angles of impact.

Using BPA software such as [[HemoSpat]] produces a very accurate result that is measurable and reproducible.

== Point and area of convergence ==
To determine the point/area of convergence an analyst has to determine the path the blood droplets travelled.  The tangential flight path of individual droplets can be determined by using the angle of impact and the offset angle of the resulting bloodstain.  “Stringing” stains is a method of visualizing this.  For the purpose of the point of convergence, only the top view of the flight paths is required.  Note that this is a two-dimensional (2D) and not a three-dimensional (3D) intersection.

*The ''point of convergence'' is the intersection of two bloodstain paths, where the stains come from opposite sides of the impact pattern. (see figure 3)
*The ''area of convergence'' is the box formed by the intersection of several stains from opposite sides of the impact pattern.  (see figure 4)

In the past, some analysts have drawn lines along the major axes of the stains and brought them to an area of convergence on the wall.  Instead of using a top-down view, they used a front view.  This provides a false point/area of convergence.

[[Image:BPA POC.png|frame|left|Fig. 3 Point of convergence]]
[[Image:BPA AOC.png|frame|left|Fig. 4 Area of convergence]]
{{clear}}

==Area of origin==
The '''area of origin''' is the area in three-dimensional space where the blood source was located at the time of the bloodletting incident.  The area of origin includes the area of convergence with a third dimension in the z direction.  Since the z-axis is perpendicular to the floor, the area of origin has three dimensions and is a volume 
The term ''point of origin'' has also been accepted to mean the same thing.  However, it has been argued, there are problems associated to this term.  First, a blood source is not a point source.  To produce a point source the mechanism would have to be fixed in three-dimensional space and have an aperture where only a single blood droplet is released at a time, with enough energy to create a pattern.  This does not seem likely.  Second, bodies are dynamic.  Aside from the victim physically moving, skin is elastic and bones break.  Once a force is applied to the body there will be an equal and opposite reaction to the force applied by the aggressor ([[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's third law|Newton's third law of motion]]).  Part of the force will move the blood source, even a millimetre, and change the origin while it is still producing blood.  So the source becomes ''contained'' in a three-dimensional volume, or region.

As with the area of convergence, the area of origin can be calculated by using BPA software.  There are other longer, mathematical methods of determining the area or origin, one of which is the tangential method.

IABPA definition:

*Point (Area) of Origin - The common point (area) in three-dimensional space to which the trajectories of several blood drops can be retraced.  (see figure 5)

[[Image:BPA Origin.gif|frame|left|Fig. 5 Area of origin (blue area representing a volume in 3D space)]]

Once the angle of impact and the point and or area of convergence are identified, there are techniques that can be used to find where the bloodshed most likely occurred.  The most basic and longest applied technique is the string method.  A blood spatter analyst positions their protractor at the location of the blood stain and projects a string at the angle of impact in the direction of the point or area of convergence.  This will predict a general origin of the blood loss.  Another technique applicable is the trigonometric method, which is fairly similar to the string method.  Since we know the point of convergence, we can measure the distance from the blood stain to that point.  With this measurement along with the angle of impact, we can use basic trigonometric rules to solve for where in space the origin of blood shed is.  By taking the tangent of the angle of impact and multiplying by the distance from the point of convergence, we can find the approximate height of the origin.&lt;ref&gt;James, Stuart (2005).

==Photography==
{{main article|Forensic photography}}
Crime scene photography has some unique requirements.  When there is a bloodletting scene, the basics are still required but special attention must be given to the bloodstains.  The current means of documenting the scene include 35&amp;nbsp;mm (B&amp;W, colour, and specialty film), digital cameras, and video (Hi-8, DV, and other formats).  Each method has its pros and cons. Often the scene is documented using multiple methods.  ([[Videography]] has been included here because it follows the same principles and provides crime scene images.)

There are three types of crime scene photos:

*'''Overall''' – [[Wide-angle lens|wide-angle]] images (28–35&amp;nbsp;mm range) that capture the scene as it is.  This type of image provides anyone who has not been in the scene a good overall layout.
*'''Mid-range''' – images taken with a [[normal lens]] (45–55&amp;nbsp;mm range) give greater detail than the overall shots.  In the case of a bloodletting scene, the mid-range image could capture a single bloodstain pattern.
*'''[[Macro photography|Close-up]]''' – images taken with a macro lens giving the greatest amount of detail.  For example, a medium velocity impact pattern can contain thousands of individual stains where there is a preponderance of small stains (1–3&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter) some of which require individual images.

Many times an analyst cannot attend a bloodletting scene, and must work from the crime scene images and notes of the person who attended.  An appropriate sized scale should be in overall, mid-range, and close-up images.  For overall images the scales should be parallel and perpendicular to the floor.  This provides the analyst, and anyone else who looks at the images, a proper perspective on what they are observing.  (Note: in some cases overall and mid-range images are taken with and ''without'' a scale.)

==Reliability==
While bloodstain pattern analysis has some foundation in science and can be a useful tool for investigators, the reliability of courtroom testimony by bloodstain pattern analysts has come under fire in recent years.  Even with proper training and methods, there are still many times where reputable analysts disagree on their findings, which calls into question the reliability of their conclusions and its value as evidence in court.&lt;ref name="Moore"/&gt;

A 1995 murder case against Warren Horinek was largely decided based on bloodstain evidence that has been hotly disputed after the fact.&lt;ref name="texaso"&gt;[https://www.texasobserver.org/a-bloody-injustice/ A Bloody Injustice]&lt;/ref&gt;  The case was bizarre in that the police and the district attorney's office believed in Horinek's innocence.  The appointed attorneys for the prosecution found a bloodstain pattern analyst who testified that rather than a suicide - what the police believed was the case, due to a variety of reasons - it was a murder, because the pattern of small blood flecks on Horinek must have come from "high velocity" blood from a gunshot, rather than blood that got on him as he attempted to provide medical aid to the victim.  Other bloodstain pattern analysts have since disputed this claim, and the original analyst has walked back the strength of his claim somewhat, although he still believes in Horinek's guilt.&lt;ref name="texaso" /&gt;  As of 2017, Horinek remains in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waco-criminal-attorney.com/news/bloody-injustice-the-warren-horinek-case.cfm Bloody Injustice - The Warren Horinek Case]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the criminal case against [[David Camm]], who was tried three times for the murder of his family largely on the basis of blood spatter evidence, both prosecution and the defense used expert bloodstain pattern analysts to interpret the source of the approximately 8 drops of blood on his shirt. The prosecution's experts included Tom Bevel and Rod Englert, who testified that the stains were high velocity impact spatter. Paul Kish, Barton Epstein, Paulette Sutton, Barrie Goetz and Stuart H. James testified for the defense that the stains were transferred from his shirt brushing against his daughter's hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kozarovich|first=Lisa Hurt|title=Blood Spatter Evidence Not an exact Science|url=http://news.lawreader.com/2013/09/07/blood-spatter-evidence-not-an-exact-science/|accessdate=8 February 2014|newspaper=News and Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Robert Shaler, Founding Director of the Penn State Forensic Science Program, decried blood spatter analysis as unreliable in the Camm case. "The problem in this case is the number of stains are minimal," he said. "I think you're really on the edge of reliability." All of the blood spatter analysts involved in the case are "[[Expert witness|experts"]] in the traditional sense. The problem is "We have two opinions in this case. That, in essence, is a 50 percent error rate." An unacceptable level of reliability in a court case when the perception of [[Guilt (law)|guilt]] [[beyond a reasonable doubt]] is what is required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kircher|first=Travis|title=David Camm blogsite: Our own little experiment|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/23605009/david-camm-blog-our-own-little-experiment|publisher=WDRB|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further complicating matters was the testimony of Rob Stites. Stites testified for the prosecution that he was an expert blood spatter analyst. It was later uncovered that he had no training and his credentials were fabrications by the prosecutor. His testimony that the blood on Camm's shirt was high velocity impact spatter aided in the conviction of David Camm. Dr. Shaler pointed out that one limitation of blood spatter analysis testimony is that "you do not have the supporting underlying [[science]]" to back up your conclusions. When Stites testified, the jury had no way of knowing that he was not the expert that he purported to be. Even among the expert witnesses, it is unknown which set of experts interpreted the stains accurately as there is no objective way of determining which bloodstain pattern analyst has applied the science correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kircher|first=Travis|title=David Camm blogsite: Uncle Sam|url=http://www.wdrb.com/story/23520116/david-camm-blog-uncle-sam|publisher=WDRB|accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other times, bloodstain patterns from different causes can mimic each other. In the 2008 trial of Travis Stay for the murder of Joel Lovelien, prosecution witness Terry Laber testified that the blood spatter on Stay's clothing came from blows to Lovelien during a fist fight. After a review of the evidence by Paul Kish, another bloodstain pattern analyst, Laber reviewed the report submitted by Kish and revised his findings to include the possibility that the blood came from expiration by Lovelien.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=ingersoll|first=archie|title=Jury finds Princeton man not guilty of murder|url=http://archives.ecmpublishers.info/2008/12/23/jury-finds-princeton-man-not-guilty-of-murder/|newspaper=The Grand Forks Herald|date=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is very little empirical evidence to support the use of blood spatter analysis in court or any other aspect of the legal system. Like many other forms of forensic science bloodstain analysis rests on the analyst interpreting ambiguity.  This ambiguity can contribute to various forms of bias. For example, confirmation bias is the tendency to search for or interpret information in a way that confirms one's preconceptions or favoured theory and to steer clear of the information that may disagree with those preconceptions. When an analyst has theories or preconceptions entering a crime scene, it may unintentionally influence how they interpret they blood stain. In addition, there are often no guidelines when they interpret a crime scene, and there often involves a use of discretion of the analyst.  As an additional complication, not all blood is alike in humans; differences can make generalizing based on one experiment difficult.  Because of these reasons, the validity of bloodstain analysis is likely not as high as many juries believe.

== In popular culture ==
* [[Sam Tyler]], the time-travelling detective in episode 3 of the BBC TV series ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'', asks his colleague [[Chris Skelton]] to make a blood pattern analysis, quickly realizing by his puzzled expression that in 1973 such techniques are not known.
* Serial killer [[Dexter Morgan]] of the ''Dexter'' novels and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] [[Dexter (TV series)|series]] is a blood spatter analyst for the fictitious Miami Metro Police Department.
* [[Julie Finlay]] is a blood spatter analyst on the CBS series ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9798">According to Rieh (2005), "Patrick Wilson (1983) developed the '''cognitive authority''' theory from [[social epistemology]] in his book, ''Second-hand Knowledge: An Inquiry into Cognitive Authority''. The fundamental concept of Wilson’s cognitive authority is that people construct knowledge in two different ways: based on their first-hand experience or on what they have learned second-hand from others. What people learn first-hand depends on the stock of ideas they bring to the interpretation and understanding of their encounters with the world. People primarily depend on others for ideas as well as for information outside the range of direct experience. Much of what they think of the world is what they have gained second-hand. Wilson (1983) argues that all that people know of the world beyond the narrow range of their own lives is what others have told them. However, people do not count all hearsay as equally reliable; only those who are deemed to “know what they are talking about” become cognitive authorities. Wilson coined the term cognitive authority to explain the kind of authority that influences thoughts that people would consciously recognize being proper. Cognitive authority differs from administrative authority or the authority vented in a hierarchical position." (Rieh, 2005).

==Philosophical issues==
Wilson's dichotomy between first hand knowledge and second hand knowledge may be a trace left from empiricism. According to non-empiricist epistemologies such as hermeneutics and pragmatism even our first hand knowledge (our perception) is influenced by our culture and hence - mostly indirectly and unconsciously - by cognitive authorities: the way we learn to look at things when brought up in a culture and socialized into a subculture and a domain.

The concept of cognitive authority is important because it forces us to be [[skeptical]] towards claims in the literature and elsewhere. It forces us to consider the criteria we should use when evaluating information [[:wikt:source|source]]s. In other words: It forces us to consider [[epistemological]] issues.

Different "movements", "paradigms", "positions" or "schools" in a given field tend to have different cognitive authorities. 
 
"Most people, even most academics, do not have the time, training, or occasion to work through the technical literature on a controversial topic, and so, they must rely on professionals for a disinterested evaluation" (Herrnstein, 1973, pp.&amp;nbsp;52,53; quoted from Tucker, 1994). Tucker shows, however, that the recognized experts within the field of intelligence research blindly accepted [[Cyril Burt]]'s research even though it was without scientific value and probably directly faked: They wanted to believe that [[IQ]] was hereditary, and considered uncritically empirical claims supporting this view. When a researcher from another field ([[Leon Kamin]]) first demonstrated that Burt's results were wrong, he was not considered a cognitive authority. When his criticism was considered unavoidable, the established researchers tried to change history and deprive Kamin of his intellectual credit. This example shows something about how cognitive authority may be ascribed in the real world.  
 
The concept of cognitive authority also raises the question of the role of experts. On the one hand, it is dangerous to blindly believe claims originating from "experts" while on the other hand, "commonsensism" is also a problematic epistemology. John Dewey (1920) discussed this dilemma and worked on improving general education in order to make the general public less vulnerable to the power of experts.

==Example: The cognitive authority of professional historians==
In about 1880, history was established as an academic discipline and as a profession based on that discipline in both Europe and the USA. The cognitive authority of history was closely related to the application of scientific methods and [[source criticism]]. A clear division was established between amateur historians and professional, scientific historians. From the dominant "paradigm" in the historical profession of that time, it was clear what to consider "cognitive authority".

However, inside history, the "paradigm" shifted to "the present period of confusion, polarization, and uncertainty, in which the idea of historical objectivity has become more problematic than ever before".&lt;ref&gt;(Novick, 1988, p. 16-17)&lt;/ref&gt;

For some the development has turned around and amateurs have the same cognitive authority as professional historians: "[I]t is not the purportedly objective investigations
of the historian into a real subject matter which lead to knowledge about history, but rather the
knowledge at which the historian arrives is conditioned
by the linguistic mode in which she/he operates.
Professional historiography for White [1973] generates no
more objective knowledge of the past than does speculative philosophy of history or the historical
novel." &lt;ref&gt;(Iggers, 2001, 6772)&lt;/ref&gt;

What is considered "cognitive authority" in a given field of knowledge is thus relative and depending on the "paradigm" of the information seeker. An argument about what should be regarded "cognitive authority" is in the end an epistemological argument.

==Implications for library and information science==
The concept of cognitive authority was developed in [[library and information science]] and has attracted a lot of attention in this field. Its importance for this field is related to questions such as: What criteria should be used for selecting information sources? For advising users about selecting information? For interpreting user studies and relevance judgments? All such issues involve questions of cognitive authority and epistemology.

"Perhaps we [library and information professionals] should learn to be more critical of the very concept of authority. Authority is legitimate only within the boundaries of the community (subject or otherwise) in which it is based. Many questions pertain to areas claimed by competing disciplines, and some to areas beyond the bounds of recognized disciplinary communities. Even when we are able to locate authoritative sources with answers to questions, they tend to be less certain than they look, and greater authority is no guarantee of quality. Authority tells us only that the creators of the source have qualifications and institutional affiliations that match the expectations of a given disciplinary community, not that the source is infallible, or even that its disciplinary community is the best to pursue the information sought" (Pierce, 1991, p.&amp;nbsp;31).

[[File:Cognitive Science Hexagon.svg|300px|thumb|Figure illustrating the fields that contributed to the birth of cognitive science, including [[linguistics]], [[neuroscience]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], and [[Cognitive Psychology|psychology]]&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from  [[George Armitage Miller|Miller, George A]] (2003). "The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective". ''[[Trends in Cognitive Sciences]]'' '''7'''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Cognitive science''' is the interdisciplinary, [[science|scientific]] study of the [[mind]] and its processes.&lt;ref&gt;Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field of researchers from Linguistics, psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, computer science, and anthropology that seek to understand the mind. [http://www.aft.org/newspubs/periodicals/ae/summer2002/willingham.cfm How We Learn: Ask the Cognitive Scientist]&lt;/ref&gt;  It examines the nature, the tasks, and the functions of [[cognition]] (in a broad sense). Cognitive scientists study intelligence and behavior, with a focus on how nervous systems represent, process, and transform [[information]]. Mental faculties of concern to cognitive scientists include [[language]], [[perception]], [[memory]], [[attention]], [[reasoning]], and [[emotion]]; to understand these faculties, cognitive scientists borrow from fields such as [[linguistics]], [[psychology]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[philosophy of mind|philosophy]], [[neuroscience]], and [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name="stanford1"&gt;[[Thagard, Paul]], [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2008/entries/cognitive-science/ Cognitive Science], ''[[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2008 Edition), [[Edward N. Zalta]] (ed.).&lt;/ref&gt; The typical analysis of cognitive science spans many levels of organization, from learning and decision to logic and planning; from [[neuron|neural]] circuitry to modular brain organization.  The fundamental concept of cognitive science is that "thinking can best be understood in terms of representational structures in the mind and computational procedures that operate on those structures."&lt;ref name="stanford1"/&gt;

Simply put: Cognitive Science is the interdisciplinary study of cognition in humans, animals, and machines. It encompasses the traditional disciplines of psychology, computer science, neuroscience, linguistics and philosophy. The goal of cognitive science is to understand the principles of intelligence with the hope that this will lead to better comprehension of the mind and of learning and to develop intelligent devices.
The cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s often referred to as the [[cognitive revolution]].

==Principles==

===Levels of analysis===
A central tenet of cognitive science is that a complete understanding of the mind/brain cannot be attained by studying only a single level. An example would be the problem of remembering a phone number and recalling it later. One approach to understanding this process would be to study behavior through direct observation, or [[naturalistic observation]]. A person could be presented with a phone number and be asked to recall it after some delay of time. Then, the accuracy of the response could be measured. Another approach to measure cognitive ability would be to study the firings of individual [[neuron]]s while a person is trying to remember the phone number. Neither of these experiments on its own would fully explain how the process of remembering a phone number works. Even if the technology to map out every neuron in the brain in real-time were available, and it were known when each neuron was firing, it would still be impossible to know how a particular firing of neurons translates into the observed behavior. Thus, an understanding of how these two levels relate to each other is imperative. ''The Embodied Mind: Cognitive Science and Human Experience'' says, “the new sciences of the mind need to enlarge their horizon to encompass both lived human experience and the possibilities for transformation inherent in human experience.”&lt;ref&gt;Varela, F. J., Thompson, E., &amp; Rosch, E. (1991). The embodied mind: cognitive science and human experience. Cambridge, Massachusetts: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be provided by a functional level account of the process. Studying a particular phenomenon from multiple levels creates a better understanding of the processes that occur in the brain to give rise to a particular behavior.
[[David Marr (psychologist)|Marr]]&lt;ref&gt;Marr, D. (1982). ''Vision: A Computational Investigation into the Human Representation and Processing of Visual Information''. W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; gave a famous description of three levels of analysis:

# the ''computational theory'', specifying the goals of the computation;
# ''representation and algorithms'', giving a representation of the inputs and outputs and the algorithms which transform one into the other; and
# the ''hardware implementation'', how algorithm and representation may be physically realized.

(See also the entry on [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].)

===Interdisciplinary nature===
Cognitive science is an interdisciplinary field with contributors from various fields, including [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[linguistics]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[computer science]], [[anthropology]] and [[biology]].  Cognitive scientists work collectively in hope of understanding the mind and its interactions with the surrounding world much like other sciences do. The field regards itself as compatible with the physical sciences and uses the [[scientific method]] as well as [[simulation]] or [[model (abstract)|modeling]], often comparing the output of models with aspects of human cognition. Similarly to the field of psychology, there is some doubt whether there is a unified cognitive science, which have led some researchers to prefer 'cognitive sciences' in plural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Miller | first1 = G. A. | year = 2003 | title = The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective | url = | journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = | pages = 141–144 | doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00029-9 | pmid=12639696}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferrés|first=Joan|last2=Masanet|first2=Maria-Jose|date=2017|title=Communication Efficiency in Education: Increasing Emotions and Storytelling|url=https://doi.org/10.3916/C52-2017-05|journal=Comunicar|language=es|volume=25|issue=52|pages=51–60|doi=10.3916/c52-2017-05|issn=1134-3478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many, but not all, who consider themselves cognitive scientists hold a [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalist]] view of the mind—the view that mental states and processes should be explained by their function - what they do. According to the [[multiple realizability]] account of functionalism, even non-human systems such as robots and computers can be ascribed as having cognition.

===''Cognitive'' science: the term===
The term "cognitive" in "cognitive science" is used for "any kind of mental operation or structure that can be studied in precise terms" ([[George Lakoff|Lakoff]] and [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Johnson]], 1999). This conceptualization is very broad, and should not be confused with how "cognitive" is used in some traditions of [[analytic philosophy]], where "cognitive" has to do only with formal rules and truth conditional semantics.

The earliest entries for the word "''cognitive''" in the [[Oxford English Dictionary|OED]] take it to mean roughly ''"pertaining to the action or process of knowing"''. The first entry, from 1586, shows the word was at one time used in the context of discussions of [[Plato]]nic theories of [[knowledge]]. Most in cognitive science, however, presumably do not believe their field is the study of anything as certain as the knowledge sought by Plato.[https://www.ripublication.com/ijcir17/ijcirv13n1_08.pdf]

==Scope==
Cognitive science is a large field, and covers a wide array of topics on cognition. However, it should be recognized that cognitive science has not always been equally concerned with every topic that might bear relevance to the nature and operation of minds. Among philosophers, classical cognitivists have largely de-emphasized or avoided social and cultural factors, emotion, consciousness, [[animal cognition]], and [[comparative psychology|comparative]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary]] psychologies. However, with the decline of behaviorism, internal states such as affects and emotions, as well as awareness and covert attention became approachable again. For example, situated and embodied cognition theories take into account the current state of the environment as well as the role of the body in cognition. With the newfound emphasis on information processing, observable behavior was no longer the hallmark of psychological theory, but the modeling or recording of mental states.

Below are some of the main topics that cognitive science is concerned with. This is not an exhaustive list. See [[List of cognitive science topics]] for a list of various aspects of the field.

===Artificial intelligence===
{{Main|Artificial intelligence|Outline of artificial intelligence}}

Artificial intelligence (AI) involves the study of cognitive phenomena in machines. One of the practical goals of AI is to implement aspects of human intelligence in computers. Computers are also widely used as a tool with which to study cognitive phenomena. [[computer model|Computational modeling]] uses simulations to study how human intelligence may be structured.&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ron (ed.) (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; (See {{section link||Computational modeling}}.)

There is some debate in the field as to whether the mind is best viewed as a huge array of small but individually feeble elements (i.e. neurons), or as a collection of higher-level structures such as symbols, schemes, plans, and rules. The former view uses [[connectionism]] to study the mind, whereas the latter emphasizes symbolic computations. One way to view the issue is whether it is possible to accurately simulate a human brain on a computer without accurately simulating the neurons that make up the human brain.

===Attention===
{{Main|Attention}}

Attention is the selection of important information.  The human mind is bombarded with millions of stimuli and it must have a way of deciding which of this information to process.  Attention is sometimes seen as a spotlight, meaning one can only shine the light on a particular set of information.  Experiments that support this metaphor include the [[dichotic listening]] task (Cherry, 1957) and studies of [[inattentional blindness]] (Mack and Rock, 1998).  In the dichotic listening task, subjects are bombarded with two different messages, one in each ear, and told to focus on only one of the messages.  At the end of the experiment, when asked about the content of the unattended message, subjects cannot report it.

===Knowledge and processing of language===
[[Image:Cgisf-tgg.svg|thumb|230px|A [[Colorless green ideas sleep furiously|well known example]] of a [[Phrase structure rules|Phrase structure tree]]. This is one way of representing human language that shows how different components are organized hierarchically. ]]
{{Main|Theoretical linguistics|Cognitive linguistics|Language|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics}}

The ability to learn and understand language is an extremely complex process. Language is acquired within the first few years of life, and all humans under normal circumstances are able to acquire language proficiently. A major driving force in the theoretical linguistic field is discovering the nature that language must have in the abstract in order to be learned in such a fashion. Some of the driving research questions in studying how the brain itself processes language include: (1) To what extent is linguistic knowledge innate or learned?, (2) Why is it more difficult for adults to acquire a second-language than it is for infants to acquire their first-language?, and (3) How are humans able to understand novel sentences?

The study of language processing ranges from the investigation of the sound patterns of speech to the meaning of words and whole sentences. [[Linguistics]] often divides language processing into [[orthography]], [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[syntax]], [[semantics]], and [[pragmatics]]. Many aspects of language can be studied from each of these components and from their interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.decodedscience.org/linguistics-short-introduction-beating-heart-human-communications/42808|title=Linguistics: Semantics, Phonetics, Pragmatics, and Human Communication|date=2014-02-16|work=Decoded Science|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Not sure that Decoded Science is the best possible source here|date=June 2018}}

The study of language processing in ''cognitive science'' is closely tied to the field of linguistics. Linguistics was traditionally studied as a part of the humanities, including studies of history, art and literature. In the last fifty years or so, more and more researchers have studied knowledge and use of language as a cognitive phenomenon, the main problems being how knowledge of language can be acquired and used, and what precisely it consists of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Daniela | last=Isac |author2=Charles Reiss | title= I-language: An Introduction to Linguistics as Cognitive Science, 2nd edition |url= http://linguistics.concordia.ca/i-language/ | year=2013|page=5 | publisher=Oxford University Press | isbn=978-0199660179}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistics|Linguists]] have found that, while humans form sentences in ways apparently governed by very complex systems, they are remarkably unaware of the rules that govern their own speech. Thus linguists must resort to indirect methods to determine what those rules might be, if indeed rules as such exist. In any event, if speech is indeed governed by rules, they appear to be opaque to any conscious consideration.

===Learning and development===
{{Main|Learning|Developmental psychology}}

Learning and development are the processes by which we acquire knowledge and information over time. Infants are born with little or no knowledge (depending on how knowledge is defined), yet they rapidly acquire the ability to use language, walk, and recognize people and objects. Research in learning and development aims to explain the mechanisms by which these processes might take place.

A major question in the study of cognitive development is the extent to which certain abilities are [[innate]] or learned. This is often framed in terms of the [[nature and nurture]] debate. The [[Psychological nativism|nativist]] view emphasizes that certain features are innate to an organism and are determined by its [[genetics|genetic]] endowment. The [[Empiricism|empiricist]] view, on the other hand, emphasizes that certain abilities are learned from the environment. Although clearly both genetic and environmental input is needed for a child to develop normally, considerable debate remains about ''how'' genetic information might guide cognitive development. In the area of [[language acquisition]], for example, some (such as [[Steven Pinker]])&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Pinker S., Bloom P.|title=Natural language and natural selection|year=1990|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|issue=4|pages=707–784|volume=13|doi=10.1017/S0140525X00081061|citeseerx=10.1.1.116.4044}}&lt;/ref&gt; have argued that specific information containing universal grammatical rules must be contained in the genes, whereas others (such as Jeffrey Elman and colleagues in [[Rethinking Innateness]]) have argued that Pinker's claims are biologically unrealistic. They argue that genes determine the architecture of a learning system, but that specific "facts" about how grammar works can only be learned as a result of experience.

===Memory===
{{Main|Memory}}

Memory allows us to store information for later retrieval. Memory is often thought of as consisting of both a long-term and short-term store. Long-term memory allows us to store information over prolonged periods (days, weeks, years). We do not yet know the practical limit of long-term memory capacity. Short-term memory allows us to store information over short time scales (seconds or minutes).

Memory is also often grouped into declarative and procedural forms. [[Declarative memory]]—grouped into subsets of [[Semantic memory|semantic]] and [[Episodic memory|episodic forms of memory]]—refers to our memory for facts and specific knowledge, specific meanings, and specific experiences (e.g. "Who was the first president of the U.S.A.?", or "What did I eat for breakfast four days ago?"). [[Procedural memory]] allows us to remember actions and motor sequences (e.g. how to ride a bicycle) and is often dubbed implicit knowledge or memory .

Cognitive scientists study memory just as psychologists do, but tend to focus in more on how memory bears on [[cognitive process]]es, and the interrelationship between cognition and memory. One example of this could be, what mental processes does a person go through to retrieve a long-lost memory? Or, what differentiates between the cognitive process of recognition (seeing hints of something before remembering it, or memory in context) and recall (retrieving a memory, as in "fill-in-the-blank")?

===Perception and action===
[[Image:Necker cube.svg|thumb|150px|[[The Necker cube]], an example of an optical illusion]]
[[Image:Grey square optical illusion.PNG|thumb|right|An optical illusion. The square A is exactly the same shade of gray as square B. See [[checker shadow illusion]].]]

{{Main|Perception}}

Perception is the ability to take in information via the [[senses]], and process it in some way. [[Visual perception|Vision]] and [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]] are two dominant senses that allow us to perceive the environment. Some questions in the study of visual perception, for example, include: (1) How are we able to recognize objects?, (2) Why do we perceive a continuous visual environment, even though we only see small bits of it at any one time? One tool for studying visual perception is by looking at how people process [[optical illusion]]s. The image on the right of a Necker cube is an example of a bistable percept, that is, the cube can be interpreted as being oriented in two different directions.

The study of [[Haptic perception|haptic]] ([[Touch|tactile]]), [[olfactory]], and [[gustatory]] stimuli also fall into the domain of perception.

Action is taken to refer to the output of a system. In humans, this is accomplished through motor responses. Spatial planning and movement, speech production, and complex motor movements are all aspects of action.

===Consciousness===
{{Main|Consciousness}}

Consciousness is the awareness whether something is an external object or something within oneself. 
This helps the mind having the ability to experience or to feel a sense of [[self]].

==Research methods==
Many different methodologies are used to study cognitive science. As the field is highly interdisciplinary, research often cuts across multiple areas of study, drawing on research methods from [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[computer science]] and [[systems theory]].

===Behavioral experiments===
In order to have a description of what constitutes intelligent behavior, one must study behavior itself. This type of research is closely tied to that in [[cognitive psychology]] and [[psychophysics]]. By measuring behavioral responses to different stimuli, one can understand something about how those stimuli are processed. Lewandowski and Strohmetz (2009) review a collection of innovative uses of behavioral measurement in psychology including behavioral traces, behavioral observations, and behavioral choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Actions can speak as loud as words: Measuring behavior in psychological science | first1 = Gary | last1 = Lewandowski | first2 = David | last2 = Strohmetz | journal = Social and Personality Psychology Compass | volume = 3 | issue = 6 | year = 2009| pages = 992–1002 | doi = 10.1111/j.1751-9004.2009.00229  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behavioral traces are pieces of evidence that indicate behavior occurred, but the actor is not present (e.g., litter in a parking lot or readings on an electric meter). Behavioral observations involve the direct witnessing of the actor engaging in the behavior (e.g., watching how close a person sits next to another person). Behavioral choices are when a person selects between two or more options (e.g., voting behavior, choice of a punishment for another participant).
* ''Reaction time.'' The time between the presentation of a stimulus and an appropriate response can indicate differences between two cognitive processes, and can indicate some things about their nature. For example, if in a search task the reaction times vary proportionally with the number of elements, then it is evident that this cognitive process of searching involves serial instead of parallel processing.
* ''Psychophysical responses.'' Psychophysical experiments are an old psychological technique, which has been adopted by cognitive psychology. They typically involve making judgments of some physical property, e.g. the loudness of a sound. Correlation of subjective scales between individuals can show cognitive or sensory biases as compared to actual physical measurements. Some examples include:
** sameness judgments for colors, tones, textures, etc.
** threshold differences for colors, tones, textures, etc.
* ''[[Eye tracking]].'' This methodology is used to study a variety of cognitive processes, most notably visual perception and language processing. The fixation point of the eyes is linked to an individual's focus of attention. Thus, by monitoring eye movements, we can study what information is being processed at a given time. Eye tracking allows us to study cognitive processes on extremely short time scales. Eye movements reflect online decision making during a task, and they provide us with some insight into the ways in which those decisions may be processed.

===Brain imaging===
{{Main|Neuroimaging}}

[[Image:Hypothalamus.jpg|thumb|150px|Image of the human head with the brain. The arrow indicates the position of the [[hypothalamus]].]]

Brain imaging involves analyzing activity within the brain while performing various tasks. This allows us to link behavior and brain function to help understand how information is processed. Different types of imaging techniques vary in their temporal (time-based) and spatial (location-based) resolution. Brain imaging is often used in [[cognitive neuroscience]].
* ''[[Single photon emission computed tomography]]'' and ''[[Positron emission tomography]]''. SPECT and PET use radioactive isotopes, which are injected into the subject's bloodstream and taken up by the brain. By observing which areas of the brain take up the radioactive isotope, we can see which areas of the brain are more active than other areas. PET has similar spatial resolution to fMRI, but it has extremely poor temporal resolution.
* ''[[Electroencephalography]]''. EEG measures the electrical fields generated by large populations of neurons in the cortex by placing a series of electrodes on the scalp of the subject. This technique has an extremely high temporal resolution, but a relatively poor spatial resolution.
* ''[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging]]''. fMRI measures the relative amount of oxygenated blood flowing to different parts of the brain. More oxygenated blood in a particular region is assumed to correlate with an increase in neural activity in that part of the brain. This allows us to localize particular functions within different brain regions. fMRI has moderate spatial and temporal resolution.
* ''[[Optical imaging]]''. This technique uses infrared transmitters and receivers to measure the amount of light reflectance by blood near different areas of the brain. Since oxygenated and deoxygenated blood reflects light by different amounts, we can study which areas are more active (i.e., those that have more oxygenated blood). Optical imaging has moderate temporal resolution, but poor spatial resolution. It also has the advantage that it is extremely safe and can be used to study infants' brains.
* ''[[Magnetoencephalography]].'' MEG measures magnetic fields resulting from cortical activity. It is similar to [[Electroencephalography|EEG]], except that it has improved spatial resolution since the magnetic fields it measures are not as blurred or attenuated by the scalp, meninges and so forth as the electrical activity measured in EEG is. MEG uses SQUID sensors to detect tiny magnetic fields.

===Computational modeling===
{{See also|Computational cognition}}
[[Image:Multi-Layer Neural Network-Vector.svg|thumb|200px|An [[artificial neural network]] with two layers.]]

[[computer model|Computational models]] require a mathematically and logically formal representation of a problem. Computer models are used in the simulation and experimental verification of different specific and general [[property|properties]] of [[intelligence]].  Computational modeling can help us understand the functional organization of a particular cognitive phenomenon.
There are two basic approaches to cognitive modeling. The first is focused on abstract mental functions of an intelligent mind and operates using symbols, and the second, which follows the neural and associative properties of the human brain, is called subsymbolic.
* ''Symbolic modeling'' evolved from the computer science paradigms using the technologies of [[knowledge-based systems]], as well as a philosophical perspective, see for example "Good Old-Fashioned Artificial Intelligence" ([[GOFAI]]). They are developed by the first cognitive researchers and later used in [[Information engineering (field)|information engineering]] for [[expert system]]s . Since the early 1990s it was generalized in [[systemics]] for the investigation of functional human-like intelligence models, such as [[personoid]]s, and, in parallel, developed as the [[Soar (cognitive architecture)|SOAR]] environment. Recently, especially in the context of cognitive decision making, symbolic cognitive modeling has been extended to the [[socio-cognitive]] approach, including social and organization cognition, interrelated with a sub-symbolic non-conscious layer.
* ''Subsymbolic modeling'' includes ''[[Connectionism|connectionist/neural network models]].'' Connectionism relies on the idea that the mind/brain is composed of simple nodes and its problem-solving capacity derives from the connections between them. [[Neural nets]] are textbook implementations of this approach. Some critics of this approach feel that while these models approach biological reality as a representation of how the system works these models lack explanatory powers because, even in systems endowed with simple connection rules, the emerging high complexity makes them less interpretable at the connection-level than they apparently are at the macroscopic level.
* Other approaches gaining in popularity include (1) the use of [[Cognitive model#Dynamical systems|dynamical systems]] theory and (2) also techniques putting symbolic models and connectionist models into correspondence (Neural-symbolic integration or [[hybrid intelligent systems]]). [[Bayesian cognitive science|Bayesian models]], often drawn from [[machine learning]], are also gaining popularity.

All the above approaches tend to be generalized to the form of integrated computational models of a synthetic/abstract intelligence, in order to be applied to the explanation and improvement of individual and social/organizational [[decision-making]] and [[Psychology of reasoning|reasoning]].&lt;ref&gt;Sun, Ron (ed.), Grounding Social Sciences in Cognitive Sciences. MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neurobiological methods===
Research methods borrowed directly from [[neuroscience]] and [[neuropsychology]] can also help us to understand aspects of intelligence. These methods allow us to understand how intelligent behavior is implemented in a physical system.

==Key findings==
Cognitive science has given rise to models of human [[cognitive bias]] and [[risk]] perception, and has been influential in the development of [[behavioral finance]], part of [[economics]].  It has also given rise to a new theory of the [[philosophy of mathematics]], and many theories of [[artificial intelligence]], [[persuasion]] and [[coercion]]. It has made its presence known in the [[philosophy of language]] and [[epistemology]] as well as constituting a substantial wing of modern [[linguistics]]. Fields of cognitive science have been influential in understanding the brain's particular functional systems (and functional deficits) ranging from speech production to auditory processing and visual perception. It has made progress in understanding how damage to particular areas of the brain affect cognition, and it has helped to uncover the root causes and results of specific dysfunction, such as [[dyslexia]], [[anopia]], and [[hemispatial neglect]].

==History==
The cognitive sciences began as an intellectual movement in the 1950s, called the [[cognitive revolution]]. Cognitive science has a prehistory traceable back to ancient Greek philosophical texts (see [[Plato]]'s [[Meno]] and [[Aristotle]]'s [[De Anima]]); and includes writers such as [[Descartes]], [[David Hume]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[Benedict de Spinoza]], [[Nicolas Malebranche]], [[Pierre Cabanis]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[John Locke]].  However, although these early writers contributed greatly to the philosophical discovery of [[mind]] and this would ultimately lead to the development of psychology, they were working with an entirely different set of tools and core concepts than those of the cognitive scientist.

The modern culture of cognitive science can be traced back to the early [[cybernetics|cyberneticists]] in the 1930s and 1940s, such as [[Warren McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts]], who sought to understand the organizing principles of the mind. McCulloch and Pitts developed the first variants of what are now known as [[artificial neural networks]], models of computation inspired by the structure of [[biological neural networks]].

Another precursor was the early development of the [[theory of computation]] and the [[digital computer]] in the 1940s and 1950s. [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alonzo Church]], [[Alan Turing]], and [[John von Neumann]] were instrumental in these developments. The modern computer, or [[Von Neumann architecture|Von Neumann machine]], would play a central role in cognitive science, both as a metaphor for the mind, and as a tool for investigation.

The first instance of cognitive science experiments being done at an academic institution took place at [[MIT Sloan School of Management]], established by [[J.C.R. Licklider]] working within the psychology department and conducting experiments using computer memory as models for human cognition.&lt;ref&gt;Hafner, K., &amp; Lyon, M. (1996). Where wizards stay up late: The origins of the Internet. New York: Simon &amp; Schuster., page 32&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1959, [[Noam Chomsky]] published a scathing review of [[B. F. Skinner]]'s book ''[[Verbal Behavior]]''. At the time, Skinner's [[behaviorist]] paradigm dominated the field of psychology within the United States. Most psychologists focused on functional relations between stimulus and response, without positing internal representations. Chomsky argued that in order to explain language, we needed a theory like [[generative grammar]], which not only attributed internal representations but characterized their underlying order.

The term ''cognitive science'' was coined by [[H. Christopher Longuet-Higgins|Christopher Longuet-Higgins]] in his 1973 commentary on the [[Lighthill report]], which concerned the then-current state of [[Artificial Intelligence]] research.&lt;ref&gt;
Longuet-Higgins, H. C. (1973). "Comments on the Lighthill Report and the Sutherland Reply", in ''Artificial Intelligence: a paper symposium'', Science Research Council, 35-37&lt;/ref&gt; In the same decade, the journal ''[[Cognitive Science (journal)|Cognitive Science]]'' and the [[Cognitive Science Society]] were founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/about_description.html Cognitive Science Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100717134015/http://www.cognitivesciencesociety.org/about_description.html |date=17 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founding meeting of the [[Cognitive Science Society]] was held at the [[University of California, San Diego]] in 1979, which resulted in cognitive science becoming an internationally visible enterprise.&lt;ref name="cogsci.ucsd.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/about-us/ucsd-cog-sci/ |title=UCSD Cognitive Science - UCSD Cognitive Science |access-date=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, [[Hampshire College]] started the first undergraduate education program in Cognitive Science, led by [[Neil Stillings]].  In 1982, with assistance from Professor Stillings, [[Vassar College]] became the first institution in the world to grant an undergraduate degree in Cognitive Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Box 729 |url=http://cogsci.vassar.edu/about/index.html |title=About - Cognitive Science - Vassar College |publisher=Cogsci.vassar.edu |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, the first Cognitive Science Department in the world was founded at the [[University of California, San Diego]].&lt;ref name="cogsci.ucsd.edu"/&gt;

In the 1970s and early 1980s, as access to computers increased, [[artificial intelligence]] research expanded. Researchers such as [[Marvin Minsky]] would write computer programs in languages such as [[LISP]] to attempt to formally characterize the steps that human beings went through, for instance, in making decisions and solving problems, in the hope of better understanding human [[thought]], and also in the hope of creating artificial minds. This approach is known as "symbolic AI".

Eventually the limits of the symbolic AI research program became apparent. For instance, it seemed to be unrealistic to comprehensively list human knowledge in a form usable by a symbolic computer program. The late 80s and 90s saw the rise of [[neural networks]] and [[connectionism]] as a research paradigm. Under this point of view, often attributed to [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]] and [[David Rumelhart]], the mind could be characterized as a set of complex associations, represented as a layered network.  Critics argue that there are some phenomena which are better captured by symbolic models, and that connectionist models are often so complex as to have little explanatory power. Recently symbolic and connectionist models have been combined, making it possible to take advantage of both forms of explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Artur S. d'Avila Garcez]], Luis C. Lamb and Dov M.

Kluwer Academic Publishers, Needham, MA. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  While both connectionism and symbolic approaches have proven useful for testing various hypotheses and exploring approaches to understanding aspects of cognition and lower level brain functions, neither are biologically realistic and therefore, both suffer from a lack of neuroscientific plausibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encephalos.gr/48-1-01e.htm|title=Encephalos Journal|website=www.encephalos.gr|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s-OCCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT18&amp;lpg=PT18&amp;dq=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22accurate%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Geographies: Feminism and the Microstructure of Cognition|last=Wilson|first=Elizabeth A.|date=2016-02-04|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317958765|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e953/59bc80e624a963a3d8c943e3b2898a397ef7.pdf|title=Organismically-inspired robotics: homeostatic adaptation and teleology beyond the closed sensorimotor loop|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zorzi|first=Marco|last2=Testolin|first2=Alberto|last3=Stoianov|first3=Ivilin P.|date=2013-08-20|title=Modeling language and cognition with deep unsupervised learning: a tutorial overview|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=4|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00515|issn=1664-1078|pmc=3747356|pmid=23970869}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarworks.sjsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1015&amp;context=comparativephilosophy|title=ANALYTIC AND CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uV9TZzOITMwC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;dq=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20plausibility%22&amp;f=false|title=Neural Network Perspectives on Cognition and Adaptive Robotics|last=Browne|first=A.|date=1997-01-01|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9780750304559|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7pPv0STSos8C&amp;pg=PA63&amp;lpg=PA63&amp;dq=%22biological+realism%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22biological%20realism%22&amp;f=false|title=Connectionism in Perspective|last=Pfeifer|first=R.|last2=Schreter|first2=Z.|last3=Fogelman-Soulié|first3=F.|last4=Steels|first4=L.|date=1989-08-23|publisher=Elsevier|year=|isbn=9780444598769|location=|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Connectionism has proven useful for exploring computationally how cognition emerges in development and occurs in the human brain, and has provided alternatives to strictly domain-specific / domain general approaches. For example, scientists such as Jeff Elman, Liz Bates, and Annette Karmiloff-Smith have posited that networks in the brain emerge from the dynamic interaction between them and environmental input.&lt;ref&gt;Karmiloff-Smith, A. (2015). An alternative to domain-general or domain-specific frameworks for theorizing about human evolution and ontogenesis.

Some of the more recognized names in cognitive science are usually either the most controversial or the most cited. Within philosophy, some familiar names include [[Daniel Dennett]], who writes from a computational systems perspective,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/computational-mind/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Rescorla|first=Michael|date=2017-01-01|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Searle]], known for his controversial [[Chinese room]] argument,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/chineser/|title=Chinese Room Argument|last=Hauser|first=Larry|date=|website=Internet Enclclopedia of Philosophy|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jerry Fodor]], who advocates [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fodor/|title=Fodor, Jerry {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others include [[David Chalmers]], who advocates [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|Dualism]] and is also known for articulating [[the hard problem of consciousness]], and [[Douglas Hofstadter]], famous for writing ''[[Gödel, Escher, Bach]]'', which questions the nature of words and thought.

In the realm of linguistics, [[Noam Chomsky]] and [[George Lakoff]] have been influential (both have also become notable as political commentators). In [[artificial intelligence]], [[Marvin Minsky]], [[Herbert A. Simon]], and [[Allen Newell]]  are prominent.

Popular names in the discipline of psychology include [[George Armitage Miller|George A. Miller]], [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]], [[Philip Johnson-Laird]],  and [[Steven Pinker]]. Anthropologists [[Dan Sperber]], [[Edwin Hutchins]], and [[Scott Atran]],    have been involved in collaborative projects with cognitive and social psychologists, political scientists and evolutionary biologists in attempts to develop general theories of culture formation, religion, and political association.

Computational theories (with models and simulations) have also been developed, by the likes of [[David Rumelhart]], [[James McClelland (psychologist)|James McClelland]], [[Philip Johnson-Laird]], and so on.

Other contributions have been made by Marvin Minsky and Noam Chomsky.

{{wiktionary|connoisseur}}
A '''connoisseur''' ([[French language|French]] [[Reforms of French orthography|traditional]] (pre-1835) spelling of ''connaisseur'', from Middle-French ''connoistre'', then ''connaître'' meaning "to be acquainted with" or "to know somebody/something.") is a person who has a great deal of [[knowledge]] about the [[fine arts]], [[cuisine]]s, or an expert judge in matters of [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]].  In many areas the term now has an air of pretension, and may be used in a partly [[irony|ironic]] sense, but in the [[art trade]] connoisseurship remains a crucial skill for the identification and attribution to individual artists of works by the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique, where documentary evidence of [[provenance]] is lacking.  The situation in the [[wine trade]] is similar, for example in assessing the potential for ageing in a young wine through [[wine tasting]].

==Connoisseurship in art==
"The ability to tell almost instinctively who painted a picture is defined [...] as connoisseurship".&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arthistorynews.com/articles/1101_On_connoisseurship |title=On Connoisseurship| first=Bendor| last=Grosvenor |website=Arthistorynews.com |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2015-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Connoisseurs evaluate works of [[art]] on the basis of their experience of the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] and technique of artists. Judgment informed by [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] is essential, but it must be grounded in a thorough understanding of the work itself. On the basis of [[empirical evidence]], refinement of [[perception]] about [[wikt:technique|technique]] and [[Art#Forms, genres, mediums, and styles|form]], and a disciplined method of analysis, the responsibility of the connoisseur is to [[:wikt:attribute|attribute]] [[authorship]], validate [[Authenticity in art|authenticity]] and appraise quality. These findings are crucial for the [[art valuation|valuation of works]], and can be collected and organized into a ''[[catalogue raisonné]]'' of the work of a single [[artist]] or a [[art school|school]].

In his ''Meaning in the Visual Arts'' (1955), [[Erwin Panofsky]] explains the difference between a connoisseur and an [[art historian]]: "The connoisseur might be defined as a [[laconic]] art historian, and the art historian as a loquacious connoisseur."

The English dealer and art historian, [[Philip Mould]] says, "it is about noticing things which have specific characteristics of the artists involved, as opposed to general characteristics of the era".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londonlovesbusiness.com/moversshakers/qa-bbcs-art-sleuth-philip-mould/1469.article |title=Interview by Gabriella Griffith |publisher=Londonlovesbusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out the importance of condition and understanding what the artist originally painted (as opposed to how the painting now looks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art Detective|first=Philip|last=Mould|date=2009|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; His colleague, [[Bendor Grosvenor]] takes the view that connoisseurship is learned by looking at paintings and cannot be taught in the classroom. He believes that it has become unfashionable in the world of art history and as a result, activities such as producing a catalogue raisonné are undervalued by the art history establishment.&lt;ref name="arthistorynews1"/&gt; [[Svetlana Alpers]] confirms the art historians reservations that the identification of individual style in works is "essentially assigned to a group of specialists in the field known as conoisseurs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Svetlana Alpers|Alpers, Svetlana]], "Style is What You Make It", p. 139, in ''The Concept of Style'', ed. Berel Lang, (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1987), 137-162, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hgiUuMCOmOcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Concept+of+Style,+ed.+Berel+Lang&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uXY8Ue2pAcSS7Ab5q4HgBw&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Concept%20of%20Style%2C%20ed.%20Berel%20Lang&amp;f=false google books]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, [[Christie's]] Education offers an MA in the History of Art and the Art Market that includes a seminar on connoisseurship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.edu/ny_ma_modconnhist.html |title=Christie's MA course components |publisher=Christies.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This covers "the critical skills needed to look at art, write about art, research and evaluate works, including handling and viewing art objects and visiting artists’ studios, conservation labs and museums."

===Earlier views of connoisseurship===
During the 18th century, the term was often used as a synonym for a still vaguer man of taste or a pretend [[critic]].

In 1760, [[Oliver Goldsmith]] said, "[[Painting]] is and has been and now will someday become the sole object of fashionable care; the title of connoisseur in that art is at present the safest passport into every fashionable Society; a well timed shrug, an admiring attitude and one or two exotic tones of exclamation are sufficient qualifications for men of low circumstances to curry favour."

In 1890, [[Giovanni Morelli]] wrote, "art connoisseurs say of art historians that they write about what they do not understand; art historians, on their side, disparage the connoisseurs, and only look upon them as the drudges who collect materials for them, but who personally have not the slightest knowledge of the physiology of art."

The attributions of painted pottery were an important project to the History of Ancient Art and Classical Archeology (Ancient Greece and South Italy). Two specialists were the most important authorities in archaeological connoisseurship: John Davidson Beazley (1885-1970) and Arthur Dale Trendall (1909-1995).

==Connoisseurs in other fields==
Connoisseur is also used in the context of [[gastronomy]], i.e. in connection with fine [[food]], [[beer]], [[wine]], [[tea]] and many other products whose consumption can be pleasing to the senses.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Connaisseur|"Connaisseur" in its original French]]{{Better source|date=December 2016|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnrtl.fr/definition/Connaisseur |title='Connaisseur' in the '&amp;#39;Centre National de Ressources Textuelles et Lexicales'&amp;#39;, 3rd meaning |publisher=Cnrtl.fr |date= |accessdate=2014-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood-Revised (DC: 0-3R)''' is a developmentally based diagnostic manual that provides clinical criteria for categorizing mental health and [[developmental disorders]] in infants and toddlers.&lt;ref name ="Casebook"&gt;Lieberman, A., Wieder, S. &amp; Fenichel, E. (Eds.), (1997). DC: 0-3 Casebook. Zero to Three Publisher.&lt;/ref&gt; It is organized into a five-part axis system.&lt;ref name = "DC 0-3"&gt;Zero To Three (2005). Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood: Revised Edition (dc:0-3r). Washington, DC, ZERO TO THREE Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The book has been translated into several languages and its model is widely adopted for the assessment of children of up to five years in age.&lt;ref name=eggar&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Egger HL, Emde RN |title=Developmentally sensitive diagnostic criteria for mental health disorders in early childhood: the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders-IV, the research diagnostic criteria-preschool age, and the diagnostic classification of mental health and developmental disorders of infancy and early childhood-revised |journal=Am Psychol |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=95–106 |year=2011 |pmid=21142337 |pmc=3064438 |doi=10.1037/a0021026 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DC 0-3R is meant to complement, but not replace, the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (DSM-IV-TR), and the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems]] (ICD-10) of the [[World Health Organization]].&lt;ref name = "Other manuals"&gt;{{Citation |author=Division of Behavioral Health Services, Arizona Department of Health Services |title=Arizona's Crosswalk for DC: 0-3R, DSM-IV-TR and ICD-9-CM |format=PDF |date=24 September 2009 |url=http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/guidance/birthtofive_attach1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701164619/http://www.azdhs.gov/bhs/guidance/birthtofive_attach1.pdf |archive-date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to enhance the understanding of young children by making it possible to assess, diagnose, and treat mental health problems in infants and toddlers by allowing for the identification of disorders not addressed in other [[Classification of mental disorders|classification systems]].

The DC: 0-3R is organized around three primary principles: 1) that children’s psychological functioning unfolds in the context of relationships, 2) that individual differences in [[temperament]] and constitutional strengths and vulnerabilities play a major role in how children experience and process events, and 3) that the family’s cultural context is important for the understanding of the child’s developmental course.&lt;ref name="Casebook" /&gt;

==History==

The first version, DC: 0-3, was published in 1994 to address the need for a systematic approach to the classification of disorders in the first few years of life. Since then, it has become increasingly valued by mental health professionals, physicians, nurses, early educators, and researchers around the world, and has been published in 8 different languages in addition to the original English edition.

===Current Edition===

Revisions to the DC: 0-3 were published in 2005 to account for the evolution of the classification system from the time when it was first published in 1994. To be addressed were certain limitations such as the lack of criteria in some of the classification categories and the need for certain clarifications. Most importantly, new knowledge from research and clinical experience dating from almost a decade was to be incorporated.&lt;ref name = "0-3"&gt;{{cite web|title=DC: 0-3 revisions|url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3-revisions.html|website=Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families|accessdate=22 March 2012|year=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013184721/http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3-revisions.html |archive-date=13 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Diagnostic Process==

The diagnostic process is one that is ongoing and done over a period of time. The process includes gathering a series of information regarding the child’s behaviour and presenting problems. The information is collected by a clinician and pertains to the child’s adaptation and development across different occasions and contexts.&lt;ref name="0-3"/&gt;

According to the DC: 0-3R, the diagnostic process consists of two aspects: 1) the classification of disorders, and 2) the assessment of individuals. One of the primary reasons for the classification of disorders is to facilitate communication between professionals. Once a diagnosis has been made, a clinician can then make associations between their clients’ symptoms and previously existing knowledge regarding the disorders' [[etiology]], [[pathogenesis]], treatment, and [[prognosis]]. Furthermore, using the classification of disorders can facilitate the process of finding existing services and mental health systems that are appropriate for the particular needs of the affected child. The assessment of children thus becomes a pivotal process that is undertaken by clinicians in order to grant access to treatment and intervention services related to specified disorders.&lt;ref name="0-3"/&gt;

Clinical assessment and diagnosis involves making observations and gathering information from multiple sources relating to the child’s life in conjunction with a general diagnostic scheme. Both the DSM and ICD classification systems have evolved to use a multiaxial scheme, thus, clinicians have been using them not only for the classification of disorder but also as a guide for assessment and diagnosis. The first three axes of the DSM and ICD relate to the classification of disorder, and the fourth and fifth relate to the assessment of the individual within their personal environment. Similarly, the DC: 0-3 and DC: 03R also follow a multiaxial scheme.&lt;ref name="0-3"/&gt;

===Classification===

The DC 0-3R provides a provisional diagnosis system, focusing on multi-axial classification. The system is a provisional system because it recognizes the fluidity and change that may occur with more knowledge in the field. This classification system is not entirely synonymous with the DSM-IV and the ICD-10, because it concentrates on developmental issues.&lt;ref name= "classification"&gt;{{Citation|editor1-last=Wieder|editor1-first=Serena|title=Diagnostic Classification 0-3: Diagnostic Classification of Mental Health and Developmental Disorders of Infancy and Early Childhood|date=October 1999|publisher=Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families|location=Washington, DC|isbn=0-943657-32-6|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED439564.pdf|format=pdf|id=[[Educational Resources Information Center|ERIC]] Number [http://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED439564 ED439564]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also an emphasis placed on dynamic processes, relationships, and adaptive patterns within a developmental framework. The use of this classification system imparts knowledge about the diagnostic profile of a child, and the various contextual factors that may contribute to difficulties.&lt;ref name="class source"&gt;{{cite web |title=The DC:0-3R Multi-Axial System |work=Zero to Three: National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families |url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3r-multi-axial-system.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303235109/http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc-0-3r-multi-axial-system.html |archive-date=3 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DC 0-3R functions as a reference for the earlier manifestations of problems in infants and children, which can be connected to later problems in functioning. Secondly, the categorization focuses on types of difficulties in young children that are not addressed in other classification models.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;

The diagnostic categories vary in description, with more familiar categories described less. Categories that are more specific to young childhood and infancy, and newly based on clinical approaches are described in more detail. Furthermore, some categories may have subtypes to promote research, clinical awareness, and intervention planning, whereas others do not. This is important information to keep in mind when reading the DC 0-3R.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;

====The Multi-Axial System====

=====Axis I: Clinical Disorders=====

Axis 1 of the DC 0-3R provides diagnostic classifications for the most primary symptoms of the presenting difficulties. These diagnoses focus on the infant or child’s functioning. The primary diagnoses include:&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

*'''[[Posttraumatic Stress Disorder]]''': This refers to children who may be experiencing or have experienced a single [[Psychological trauma|traumatic]] event (e.g. an earthquake), a series of traumatic events (e.g. [[Strategic bombing|air raids]]), or chronic stress (e.g. [[abuse]]).  Furthermore, the nature of the trauma and its effect on the child must be understood in the context of the child.  Specifically, attention must be paid to factors such as social context, [[Personality development|personality]] factors, and the caregivers’ ability to assist with coping.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;
*'''Disorders of Affect''': This classification of disorders is related to the infant or child’s affective and behavioural experiences. This group of disorders includes [[mood disorders]] and deprivation/maltreatment disorder.  This classification focuses on the infant or child’s functioning in its entirety rather than a specific event or situation.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt; (See [[Affective spectrum]])
*'''[[Adjustment disorder|Adjustment Disorder]]''': When considering a diagnosis of adjustment disorder, one has to examine the situational factors to determine if it is a mild disruption in the child’s usual functioning (e.g. switching schools). These difficulties must also not meet the criteria for other disorders included in the categories.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;
*'''Regulation Disorders of Sensory Processing''': The child manifests difficulties in regulating behavioural, motor, attention, physiological, sensory, and affective processes. These difficulties can affect the child’s daily functioning and relationships.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt; (See [[Sensory processing disorder]])
*'''Sleep Behaviour Disorder''': To diagnose a [[sleep disorder]], the child should be showing a sleep disturbance and not be demonstrating sensory reactive or processing difficulties. This diagnosis should not be used when sleep problems are related to issues of [[Anxiety disorder|anxiety]] or traumatic events.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;
*'''Eating Behaviour Disorder''': This diagnosis may become evident in infancy and young childhood as the child may show difficulties in regular eating patterns. The child may not be regulating feeding with physiological reactions of hunger. This diagnosis is a primary diagnosis in the absence of traumatic, affective, and regulatory difficulties.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt; (See [[Eating disorder]])
*'''Disorders of Relating and Communicating''': These disorders involve difficulties in communication, in conjunction with difficulties in regulation of physiological, motor, cognitive, and many other processes.&lt;ref name="classification"/&gt;

=====Axis II: Relationship Classification=====

Axis II focuses on children and infants developing in the context of emotional relationships. Specifically, the quality of caregiving can have a strong impact in nurturance and steering a child on a particular developmental course, either adaptive or maladaptive. This particular axis concentrates on the diagnosis of a clinical issue in the relationship between the child and the caregiver. The presence of a disorder indicates difficulties in relationships. These disorders include various patterns that highlight behaviour, affective, and psychological factors between the child and the caregiver.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

*Overinvolved
*Underinvolved
*Anxious/Tense
*Angry/Hostile
*Mixed Relationship Disorder
*Abusive

=====Axis III: Medical and Developmental Disorders and Conditions=====

Axis III focuses on physical, mental, or developmental classification using other diagnosis methods. These disorders and conditions are not treated as a single diagnosis, but as a problem that may co-exist with others, as it may involve developmental difficulties.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

=====Axis IV: Psychosocial Stressors=====

This axis allows clinicians to focus on the intensity of psychosocial stress, which may act as influencing agents in infant and childhood difficulties/disorders. Psychosocial stress can have direct and indirect influences on infants and children, and depends on various factors.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

=====Axis V: Emotional and Social Functioning=====

Emotional and social functioning capacities can be assessed using observations of the child with primary caregivers. The essential domains of functioning can be used in these observations on a 5-point scale, that describes overall functional emotional level.&lt;ref name="class source"/&gt;

===Rating Scales and Checklists===

The DC: 0-3R contains four forms&lt;ref name="Forms"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc0-3r-forms.html |title=DC:0-3R Forms to Reproduce |work=Zero to Three |publisher=National Center for Infants, Toddlers and Families |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304003754/http://www.zerotothree.org/child-development/early-childhood-mental-health/dc0-3r-forms.html |archive-date=4 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that aid clinicians in identifying disorders in infants and toddlers, in examining the extent of problem behaviours, and in determining the nature of external factors influencing the child.

*'''Functional Rating Scale for Emotional and Social Functioning Capacities''': to evaluate the child’s communication skills and expressions of thoughts and feelings.
*'''The Parent-Infant Relationship Global Assessment Scale (PIR-GAS; from [[#Axis II: Relationship Classification|Axis II]])''': to evaluate the quality of a caregiver-child relationship and identify relationship disorders.
*'''Relationship Problems Checklist (RPCL; from [[#Axis II: Relationship Classification|Axis II]])''': allows the clinician to identify the extent to which a caregiver-child relationship can be described by a number of criterion-based qualities.
*'''Psychosocial and Environmental Stressors Checklist (from [[#Axis IV: Psychosocial Stressors|Axis IV]])''': to provide information on the stressors experienced by the child in various contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Robert N. |last1=Emde |first2=Helen |last2=Egger |first3=Emily |last3=Fenichel |first4=Antoine |last4=Guedeney |first5=Brian K. |last5=Wise |first6=Harry H. |last6=Wright |date=September 2005 |title=Introducing DC:0–3R |journal=Zero to Three |url=http://main.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/vol26-1a.pdf |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=35–41 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150701175858/http://main.zerotothree.org/site/DocServer/vol26-1a.pdf |archive-date=1 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Future of DC 0-3R==

Important questions remain to be answered, in spite of the revisions made in the DC: 0-3R. Such questions include the following:

#How can the functional adaptation of infants and children be evaluated and described independent of diagnosis?
# How can disruptive behaviours of typical development in infants and children be distinguished from disordered behaviours that lead to atypical development?
# Should Excessive Crying Disorder be considered as a functional regulatory disorder? Other functional regulatory disorders include Sleeping Behaviour and Feeding Behaviour Disorders.
# Should future editions of the DC: 0-3 include a Family Axis containing information about family history of mental illness, family structure and available supports, and family culture? These aspects are all central to assessment and treatment planning.

'''Erosion control''' is the practice of preventing or controlling wind or water [[erosion]] in [[agriculture]], [[land development]], [[coast|coastal areas]], [[Bank (geography)|river banks]] and [[construction]]. Effective erosion controls handle [[surface runoff]] and are important techniques in preventing [[water pollution]], [[soil erosion|soil loss]], wildlife [[habitat loss]] and human [[property]] loss.

==Usage==
Erosion controls are used in natural areas, agricultural settings or urban environments. In urban areas erosion controls are often part of [[stormwater]] runoff management programs required by local governments. The controls often involve the creation of a physical barrier, such as vegetation or rock, to absorb some of the energy of the wind or water that is causing the erosion. They also involve building and maintaining [[storm drain]]s. On construction sites they are often implemented in conjunction with [[sediment control]]s such as [[sediment basin]]s and [[silt fence]]s.

[[Bank erosion]] is a natural process: without it, rivers would not meander and change course. However, land management patterns that change the hydrograph and/or vegetation cover can act to increase or decrease channel migration rates. In many places, whether or not the banks are unstable due to human activities, people try to keep a river in a single place. This can be done for environmental reclamation or to prevent a river from changing course into land that is being used by people. One way that this is done is by placing riprap or gabions along the bank.

==Examples==
Examples of erosion control methods include:

==Mathematical modeling==
Since the 1920s and 1930s&lt;ref&gt;Robert E. Horton. 1933&lt;/ref&gt; scientists have been creating [[mathematical model]]s for understanding the mechanisms of soil erosion and resulting sediment [[surface runoff]], including an early paper by [[Albert Einstein]] applying [[Baer's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Albert Einstein. 1926&lt;/ref&gt; These models have addressed both gully and sheet erosion. Earliest models were a simple set of linked equations which could be employed by manual calculation. By the 1970s the models had expanded to complex [[computer model]]s addressing [[nonpoint source pollution]] with thousands of lines of computer code.&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan, Leda Patmore, Gary Latshaw, Harry Seidman et al. 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The more complex models were able to address nuances in micrometeorology, soil particle size distributions and micro-terrain variation.

'''''Ethnologue: Languages of the World''''' is an annual reference publication in print and online that provides statistics and other information on the living [[language]]s of the world.  It was first issued in 1951, and is now published annually by [[SIL International]], a U.S.-based, worldwide, Christian non-profit organization.  SIL's main purpose is to study, develop and document languages to promote literacy and for religious purposes. 

As of 2018, ''Ethnologue'' contains web-based information on 7,097 languages in its 21st edition,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/ ''Ethnologue''] 21st edition website&lt;/ref&gt; including the number of speakers, locations, dialects, linguistic affiliations, [[Exonym and endonym|autonyms]], availability of the Bible in each language and dialect described, a cursory description of revitalization efforts where reported, and an estimate of language viability using the '''Expanded Graded [[Intergenerationality|Intergenerational]] Disruption Scale''' ('''''EGIDS''''').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Lewis|first1=M. Paul|first2=Gary F.|last2=Simons|year=2010|title=Assessing Endangerment: Expanding Fishman’s GIDS|journal=[[:fr:Revue Roumaine de linguistique|Romanian Review of Linguistics]]|volume=55|issue=2|pp=103–120|url=http://www-01.sil.org/~simonsg/preprint/EGIDS.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
''Ethnologue'' has been published by [[SIL International]] (formerly known as the Summer Institute of Linguistics), a Christian [[linguistics|linguistic]] service organization with an international office in [[Dallas]], Texas. 
The organization studies numerous minority languages to facilitate language development, and to work with speakers of such language communities in translating portions of the Bible into their languages.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;
 
The determination of what characteristics define a single language depends upon [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] evaluation by various scholars; as the preface to ''Ethnologue'' states, "Not all scholars share the same set of criteria for what constitutes a 'language' and what features define a '[[dialect]]'." ''Ethnologue'' follows general linguistic criteria, which are based primarily on mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sil.org/iso639-3/scope.asp |title=Scope of denotation for language identifiers |publisher=[[SIL International]] |accessdate=2013-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shared language intelligibility features are complex, and usually include etymological and grammatical evidence that is agreed upon by experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aUxveGrrv-4C&amp;pg=PA464 |title=Basic Linguistic Theory Volume 3: Further Grammatical Topics |first=R. M. W. |last=Dixon |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |date=May 24, 2012 |accessdate=2014-07-13 |p=464 |isbn=9780199571093}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to choosing a primary name for a language, ''Ethnologue'' provides listings of the name(s) for the language and any dialects that are used by its speakers, government, foreigners and neighbors.  Also included are any names that have been commonly referenced historically, regardless of whether a name is considered official, politically correct or offensive; this allows more complete historic research to be done. These lists of names are not necessarily complete.

==History==
In 1984, ''Ethnologue'' released a three-letter coding system, called an 'SIL code', to identify each language that it described. This set of codes significantly exceeded the scope of other standards, e.g. [[ISO 639-1]] and [[ISO 639-2]].{{sfn|Everaert|2009|p=204}} The 14th edition, published in 2000, included 7,148 language codes.

In 2002, ''Ethnologue'' was asked to work with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO) to integrate its codes into a draft international standard. The 15th edition of ''Ethnologue'' was the first edition to use this standard, called [[ISO 639-3]]. This standard is now administered separately from Ethnologue (though still by SIL according to rules established by ISO, and since then ''Ethnologue'' relies on the standard to determine what is listed as a language).&lt;ref name="ELL"&gt;{{cite book | contribution = Ethnologue | first1 = Gary F. | last1 = Simons | first2 = Raymond G. | last2 = Gordon | volume = 4 | pages = 250–253 | title = Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics | editor-first = Edward Kenneth | editor-last = Brown | edition = 2nd | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-08-044299-0|url=http://www-01.sil.org/~simonsg/preprint/ELL2%20Ethnologue.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In only one case, ''Ethnologue'' and the ISO standards treat languages slightly differently.  ISO 639-3 considers [[Akan language|Akan]] to be a [[ISO 639 macrolanguage|macrolanguage]] consisting of two distinct languages, [[Twi]] and [[Fante dialect|Fante]], whereas ''Ethnologue'' considers Twi and Fante to be dialects of a single language (Akan), since they are mutually intelligible. This anomaly resulted because the ISO 639-2 standard has separate codes for Twi and Fante, which have separate literary traditions, and all 639-2 codes for individual languages are automatically part of 639–3, even though 639-3 would not normally assign them separate codes.

In 2014, with the 17th edition, ''Ethnologue'' introduced a numerical code for language status using a framework called EGIDS (Expanded Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale), an elaboration of [[Joshua Fishman|Fishman's]] GIDS ([[Graded Intergenerational Disruption Scale]]). It ranks a language from 0 for an [[World language|international language]] to 10 for an [[extinct language]], i.e. a language with which no-one retains a sense of ethnic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/about/language-status |title=Language status |publisher=Ethnologue |date=2014 |accessdate=2015-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, ''Ethnologue'' launched a metered [[paywall]]; users in [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income countries]] who want to refer to more than seven pages of data per month must buy a [[paid subscription]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Paul Lewis, [http://www.ethnologue.com/ethnoblog/m-paul-lewis/ethnologue-launches-subscription-service#.VmSMQL_bFpE "Ethnologue launches subscription service."] ''Ethnologue.'' December 6, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017, ''Ethnologue'''s 20th edition described 237 [[language families]] including 86 [[language isolates]] and six typological categories, namely [[sign language]]s, [[Creole language|creole]]s, [[pidgin]]s, [[mixed language]]s, [[constructed language]]s, and as yet [[unclassified languages]].&lt;ref name="EthnologueList"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ethnologue.com/browse/families |title=Browse by Language Family |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=2015-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, [[William Bright]], then editor of the journal ''[[Language (journal)|Language]]'', wrote of ''Ethnologue'' that it "is indispensable for any reference shelf on the languages of the world".&lt;ref&gt;Bright, William.  1986. "Book Notice on ''Ethnologue''", ''Language'' 62:698.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 in the same journal, Lyle Campbell and Verónica Grondona said: "''Ethnologue''...has become the standard reference, and its usefulness is hard to overestimate."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ethnologue: Languages of the world (review)|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/language/v084/84.3.campbell.html|journal = Language|date = January 1, 2008|issn = 1535-0665|pages = 636–641|volume = 84|issue = 3|doi = 10.1353/lan.0.0054|first = Lyle|last = Campbell|first2 = Verónica|last2 = Grondona}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Harald Hammarström, an editor of ''[[Glottolog]]'', criticized the publication for frequently lacking citations and failing to articulate clear principles of [[Linguistic typology|language classification]] and identification. However, he concluded that, on balance, "''Ethnologue'' is an impressively comprehensive catalogue of world languages, and it is far superior to anything else produced prior to 2009."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Ethnologue 16/17/18th editions: A comprehensive review|url = https://muse.jhu.edu/journals/language/v091/91.3.hammarstrom.html|journal = Language|date = 2015|issn = 1535-0665|pages = 723–737|volume = 91|issue = 3|doi = 10.1353/lan.2015.0038|first = Harald|last = Hammarström}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Florida Institute of Oceanography''' (FIO), located on the campus of the [[University of South Florida St. Petersburg]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usfsp.edu/home/2016/04/22/florida-institute-of-oceanography-appoints-new-director/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography Appoints New Director|date=2016-04-22|work=University of South Florida St. Petersburg|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an independent entity of the [[State University System of Florida]] that works collaboratively with 20 institutions and agencies from across the state that support marine research.

== Facilities ==
The FIO operates several smaller ships, as well as two research vessels. The flagship of the institute is R/V ''Weatherbird II,'' a 115-foot, 194-ton vessel, that was acquired and renovated in 2009, and soon made national headlines as one of the most active research vessels during the [[2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill|2010 Deep Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ilovetheburg.com/rv-weatherbird-ii-a-st-pete-icon/|title=R/V Weatherbird II: A St. Pete Icon - I Love the Burg|website=ilovetheburg.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fio.usf.edu/vessel-fleet/rv-weatherbird-ii|title=R/V Weatherbird II {{!}} vessels {{!}} Florida Institute of Oceanography (FIO)|website=www.fio.usf.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, FIO launched R/V ''W.T. Hogarth,'' a state of the art research vessel replacing the nearly 50-year-old R/V ''Bellows'' which had served as a floating laboratory for 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.oceannews.com/news/science-technology/florida-institute-of-oceanography-new-research-vessel|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography New Research Vessel {{!}} Science &amp; Technology {{!}} News|last=|first=|date=30 May 2017|work=Ocean News &amp; Technology|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The R/V ''W.T. Hogarth'' was named after Dr. William T. Hogarth, who served as the director of the FIO until his retirement in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usfsp.edu/home/2016/04/22/florida-institute-of-oceanography-appoints-new-director/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography Appoints New Director|date=2016-04-22|work=University of South Florida St. Petersburg|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1990, it co-manages the Keys Marine Laboratory on [[Long Key, Florida|Long Key]] with the [[Fish and Wildlife Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keysmarinelab.org/about/history.html|title=History of the Keys Marine Lab|website=keysmarinelab.org|access-date=2018-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Members==
The institute is governed by the FIO Council. Council members serve two-year terms and are active members of the Florida oceanographic science and education community. In addition to advising the FIO leadership regarding statewide collaboration in oceanographic science and education, the council’s key duty is to plan and align legislative budget requests with strategic priorities.

==Research==
Since the 1960s, the Florida Institute of Oceanography has unified marine science interests across Florida in the cause of understanding and stewardship of the coastal oceans. FIO has taken a leading national role in the scientific assessment of the impact of the ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'' oil spill in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://stpeteinnovationdistrict.com/innovators/florida-institute-of-oceanography/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography • St Pete Innovation District|work=St Pete Innovation District|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://stpeteedc.com/top-companies/florida-institute-of-oceanography/|title=Florida Institute of Oceanography - St Pete EDC|work=St Pete EDC|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FIO has emerged as a key research organization on the effects of the ''Deepwater Horizon'' oil spill with the award of $10 million from the oil company BP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.83degreesmedia.com/inthenews/fio62210.aspx|title=Florida Institute Of Oceanography Receives $10 M Research Grant From BP|work=83Degrees|access-date=2018-11-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an application process which began in June 2010, the FIO received more than 200 proposals from researchers totaling more than $60 million.

To apply for funding, scientists were asked to develop research proposals related to the following scientific priorities in spill research:

:Determine the properties, distribution, and extent of the oil spill and dispersants.
:Conduct baseline studies and impact assessments to provide the basis for long-term monitoring.
:Contribute to an integrated coastal and ocean observing system, and improve modeling capabilities for forecasting environmental impacts related to the oil spill.
:Develop and implement systems for data integration, synthesis, sharing, and dissemination.
:Develop and implement strategies to protect and restore habitats and species.
:Priority will be given to projects that are collaborative between two or more FIO members and/or the Northern Gulf Institute and Louisiana State University, which also received BP funding for initial research.

'''Form-versus-content humour''' is a type of [[humour]] in an [[:wikt:incongruity|incongruity]] between a statement's content and the way it is communicated makes it humorous. It is one of the basic techniques of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] humour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=How to Laugh Your Way Through Life: A Psychoanalyst's Advice |first=Paul |last=Marcus |publisher=Karnac Books |year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[form and content|Form-versus-content]] humour can be delivered, for example, by presenting a message in a form that inherently defeats the ostensible purpose of the message, or in a form that is fundamentally incapable of carrying the important part of the message. The ''[[Jargon File]]'' gives an example of this type of humor: a red [[index card]] with GREEN written on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jargon.net/jargonfile/h/hackerhumor.html |title=hacker humor |website=The Jargon File, version 4.4.8 |editor=Eric S.

'''Forschungszentrum Jülich''' ("Jülich Research Centre") is a member of the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres]] and is one of the largest interdisciplinary research centres in [[Europe]]. It was founded on 11 December 1956 by the state of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] as a registered association, before it became "Kernforschungsanlage Jülich GmbH" or Nuclear Research Centre Jülich in 1967. In 1990, the name of the association was changed to "Forschungszentrum Jülich GmbH". It has close collaborations with [[RWTH Aachen]] in the form of [[RWTH Aachen#Jülich-Aachen Research Alliance (JARA)|Jülich-Aachen Research Alliance (JARA)]].

== Location ==
[[Image:Forschungszentrum Juelich-Lage.png|thumb|Location of Forschungszentrum Jülich in Germany]] Forschungszentrum Jülich is situated in the middle of the Stetternich Forest in [[Jülich]] ([[Düren (district)|Kreis Düren]], [[Rheinland]]) and covers an area of 2.2 square kilometres.

== Financing ==
The annual [[budget]] of Forschungszentrum Jülich is approximately € 530 million (in 2009). Public funds are split between the German Federal Government (90%) and the Federal State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]] (10%).

== Staff/size ==
Forschungszentrum Jülich employs more than 5,700 members of staff (2015) and works within the framework of the disciplines [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[medicine]] and [[engineering]] on the basic principles and applications in the areas of [[health]], [[information]], [[Environmental science|environment]] and [[energy]]. Amongst the members of staff, there are approx. 1,500 scientists including 400 PhD students and 130 diploma students. Around 600 people work in the administration and service areas, 500 work for project management agencies, and there are 1,600 technical staff members, while around 330 trainees are completing their training in more than 20 different professions.

More than 800 visiting scientists come to Forschungszentrum Jülich every year from about 50 different countries.

=== Training and apprenticeships ===
In 2003, 367 people were trained in 20 different professions at Forschungszentrum Jülich. The proportion of trainees lies around 9% and is more than twice as high as the German national average (for companies with more than 500 employees). In cooperation with [[RWTH Aachen University]] and Aachen University of Applied Sciences, Forschungszentrum Jülich also offers combined practical and academic courses. After they have successfully completed their exams, graduates are offered six months employment in their chosen profession. Between 1959 and 2007 around 3,800 trainees completed their training in more than 25 different professions.

No lectures are held at Forschungszentrum Jülich itself, but in line with the so-called "Jülich model", the directors of the institutes are appointed professors at nearby universities in a joint procedure with the Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia (usually Aachen, Bonn, Cologne, Düsseldorf, but also universities farther away such as Duisburg-Essen or Münster). By holding a lectureship there, they can fulfil their teaching duties. Many other scientists at Forschungszentrum Jülich who have achieved habilitation also undertake lectureships in the nearby universities. In cooperation with the universities, what are known as "research schools" (e.g. "German Research School for Simulation Science" with [[RWTH Aachen|RWTH Aachen University]] or "International Helmholtz Research School of Biophysics and Soft Matter" with the universities of Cologne and Düsseldorf) are founded in an effort to support the scientific training of students.

An exception to this is the training of mathematical-technical assistants. In cooperation with Aachen University of Applied Sciences (Campus Jülich), the lectures required for the B.Sc. in "Scientific Programming" are largely held in the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics (ZAM) by university professors and ZAM instructors. For the subsequent M.Sc. in "Technomathematics", the same model applies and some of the lectures are held by ZAM staff.

Every year, Forschungszentrum Jülich hosts a two-week IFF Summer School, which addresses current issues in solid-state physics.

== Large-scale facilities at Forschungszentrum Jülich ==

=== Cooler Synchrotron COSY ===
'''COSY''' ('''Co'''oler '''Sy'''nchrotron) is a particle accelerator ([[synchrotron]]) and storage ring (circumference: 184 m) for accelerating [[proton]]s and [[deuteron]]s operated by the Institute of [[Nuclear physics|Nuclear Physics]] (IKP) at Forschungszentrum Jülich.

COSY is characterised by what is known as beam cooling, which reduces the deviation of particles from their predetermined path (can also be understood as the thermal motion of particles) using [[electron]] or [[stochastic]] cooling. At COSY there are a number of experimental facilities for studies in the field of [[hadron]] physics. These include the ANKE magnetic spectrometer, the TOF flight spectrometer and the WASA universal detector, which was moved to COSY from the CELSIUS storage ring of The Svedberg Laboratoriet (TSL) in Uppsala, Sweden in 2005.    

COSY is one of the only accelerators in the medium energy range with both electron cooling and stochastic cooling.

The synchrotron is used by scientists from German and international research institutions at internal and external target stations. It is one of the research facilities used for collaborative research supported by the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)]].

=== Research reactor FRJ-2 ===
[[File:Forschungsreaktor Jülich 2.jpg|right|thumb|Research reactor FRJ-2]]'''FRJ-2''' was a reactor of the same class as [[DIDO (nuclear reactor)|DIDO]] and was used for [[neutron]] scattering experiments. It has been operated by the Central [[Research reactor|Research Reactors]] Division (ZFR). FRJ-2 was the strongest [[neutron source]] in the [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Association]] and it was primarily used to conduct scattering and spectroscopic experiments on [[condensed matter]].
On May 2, 2006, FRJ-2 was shut down after almost 44 years or 18,875 days of operation. The experiments at FRJ-2 were dismantled bit by bit and transferred to Jülich's outstation at the [[FRM II]] research reactor in Garching near Munich.

In May 2006, the Jülich Centre for Neutron Science JCNS was founded as response to the shut down of FRJ-2. JCNS operates instruments at the national and international leading sources FRM II, Institut Laue-Langevin in Grenoble, France, and Spallation Neutron Source SNS in OakRidge, USA, under a common scientific objective and provides external users with access to world class instruments under standardized conditions. The breadth of JCNS is comparable to a facility based around a medium flux research reactor, though it offers the quality of high flux sources. JCNS also provides a frame for the method and instrument development program of FZJ and for its in-house research in the condensed matter and key technology programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcns.info/about_jcns/ JCNS about] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716093737/http://www.jcns.info/about_jcns |date=2011-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supercomputers ===
The following [[supercomputer]]s are all operated in Jülich by the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics (ZAM) within the framework of the [[John von Neumann]] Institute for Computing (NIC).

==== JUGENE - Petascale BlueGene/P system ====
From autumn 2007 the [[JUGENE]], an IBM [[Blue Gene#Blue Gene/P|Blue Gene/P]] computer is running and was officially started in February 2008.  Its 65,000 processors reached 220 TFLOPS. It started out as the fastest computer in Europe and the second fastest in the world. On May 26, 2009, the newly upgraded JUGENE was unveiled. It includes 294 912 processor cores, 144 [[terabyte]] memory, 6 [[petabyte]] storage in 72 racks. With a peak performance of about one [[FLOPS|PetaFLOPS]], it was the third fastest computer and fastest computer in Europe&lt;ref name="top500jun09"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://top500.org/list/2009/06/100|title=Top500 List - June 2009 - TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it currently (November 2010) is the ninth fastest supercomputer in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top500.org/site/649/list/36 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202010849/http://top500.org/site/649/list/36 |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==== JUROPA ====
JuRoPA (''Jülich Research on Petascale Architecture'') is an Intel Xeon X5570 based [[Cluster (computing)|Cluster]] supercomputer with a peak performance of 308 TFLOPS and 79 [[terabyte]] main memory; in June 2009 it was the 10th fastest computer of the world and the second fastest (after JUGENE) in Europe.&lt;ref name="top500jun09"/&gt; It currently (November 2010) is the 23rd fastest supercomputer worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.top500.org/list/2009/11/100|title=Top500 List - November 2009 - TOP500 Supercomputer Sites|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== JUBL ====
'''JUBL''' (''Jülich BlueGene/L'') was a massively parallel [[supercomputer]], based on IBMs [[Blue Gene|Blue Gene/L]] architecture, with 16,384&amp;nbsp;[[Central Processing Unit|processors]] (8192&amp;nbsp;nodes each with two processors) and an [[Primary storage|internal memory]] of 4.1&amp;nbsp;[[Byte|terabytes]] (512&amp;nbsp;megabytes per node). It was capable of a peak performance (R&lt;sub&gt;peak&lt;/sub&gt;) of 45.87&amp;nbsp;[[FLOPS|TFLOPS]]. The [[LINPACK]] performance (R&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) is 37.33 TFLOPS. At the time when it officially went into operation, JUBL was the 6th most powerful computer in the world.

==== JUICE ====
Since spring 2007, '''JUICE''' (Juelich Initiative Cell Cluster) has been in operation. It is a cluster based on IBMs [[Cell microprocessor]]. Twelve [[IBM_BladeCenter#QS20|QS20]] blades with 24 Cell CPUs and 12GB RAM provide a peak LINPACK performance of 4.8&amp;nbsp;TFLOP/s. The cluster uses [[Mellanox]] 4x [[Infiniband]] cards and a 24-port Voltaire switch for highspeed communication.

==== IBM p690 Cluster Jump ====
The massively parallel supercomputer '''[[IBM]] p690 Cluster Jump''' has been in operation since the beginning of 2004.

With 1312&amp;nbsp;processors (41&amp;nbsp;nodes each with 32&amp;nbsp;processors) and an internal memory of 5&amp;nbsp;terabytes (128&amp;nbsp;gigabytes per node), the computer can achieve a maximum performance of 5.6&amp;nbsp;TFLOPS, which placed it at number 21 in the list of the most powerful computers in the world at the time of its inauguration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://top500.org/site/649/list/23 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202011847/http://top500.org/site/649/list/23 |archivedate=2010-12-02 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; The nodes are linked to each other through a high performance switch (HPS). Through a globally parallel data system, applications have access to more than 60&amp;nbsp;terabytes of storage space and an integrated cassette storage with a capacity of one petabyte. The IBM p690 Cluster Jump is run on the [[IBM AIX|AIX]]&amp;nbsp;5.1 [[operating system]].

A new building (1,000&amp;nbsp;m²) was built especially for the IBM p690 Cluster Jump beside the Central Institute for Applied Mathematics.

==== CRAY SV1ex ====
''No longer in operation''

The vector computer '''[[Cray|CRAY]] SV1ex''' was the successor of CRAY J90, which was in operation between 1996 and 2002. It represented the next stage in the computer series of the parallel vector computers with a shared memory, CRAY X-MP, Y-MP and C90.
With 16 [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]]s and an internal memory of 32 [[Byte|gigabytes]], the CRAY SV1ex had a performance of 32 [[Flops|GFLOPS]]. It was run on the [[Unicos|UNICOS]] 10.0 operating system.  This computer was decommissioned on June 30, 2005.

==== CRAY J90 ====
''No longer in operation''

The vector computer '''CRAY J90''' was used as a [[file server]]. It had 12 [[Central Processing Unit|processors]], an internal memory of 2 [[Byte|gigabytes]] and boasted a performance of 3 GFLOPS. CRAY J90 was also run on UNICOS 10.0 and it too was decommissioned on June 30, 2005.

'''TEXTOR''' ('''T'''okamak '''EX'''periment for '''T'''echnology '''O'''riented '''R'''esearch) was a [[tokamak]] in the field of [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]-wall interaction operated by the Institute of Energy Research - [[Plasma (physics)|Plasma Physics]] (IEK-4) at Forschungszentrum Jülich.

Until it was decommissioned in December 2013, TEXTOR was used for research into [[nuclear fusion]]. In experiments, [[hydrogen]] was heated to a temperature of up to 50 megakelvins so that it took the form of a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Studies of the interaction of this plasma with the surrounding wall constituted a major part of the research performed. The knowledge gained is mainly being applied to a new experimental reactor, [[ITER]], which is currently under construction in Cadarache (South France) with the help of Forschungszentrum Jülich among others.

=== Magnetic resonance tomography ===
The Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-4) houses several magnetic resonance scanners, the largest of which is a 9.4 [[Tesla (unit)|tesla]] combined [[Positron emission tomography|PET]]-[[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI]] machine for scanning humans, which is one of the highest field devices in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fz-juelich.de/inm/inm-4/EN/UeberUns/Einrichtungen/_node.html Institute of Neuroscience and Medicine (INM-4): Facilities&lt;/ref&gt; The institute also houses a 3T combined PET-MR system, a 3T and a 4T MR system, all for human use, and a 9.4T small-animal scanner.

=== SAPHIR Atmosphere Simulation Chamber===
[[Image:Simulation Atmosphärischer Photochemie in einer großen Reaktionskammer.jpg|thumb|SAPHIR]]In the 20-meter long '''[[SAPHIR]]''' chamber ('''S'''imulation of '''A'''tmospheric '''PH'''otochemistry '''I'''n a large '''R'''eaction Chamber), a group in the Institute of Chemistry and Dynamics of the [[Geosphere]] - [[Troposphere]] (ICG-II) investigates photochemical reactions in the [[atmosphere]].

=== PhyTec experimental facility for cultivating plants ===
Since 2003, a greenhouse with cutting-edge technology has been available at Forschungszentrum Jülich.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fz-juelich.de/icg/icg-3/datapool/general/PhyTec_eng_internetQualitaet.pdf Flyer (PDF)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003158/http://www.fz-juelich.de/icg/icg-3/datapool/general/PhyTec_eng_internetQualitaet.pdf |date=2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum transparency of the panels (over 95%) is achieved in the spectral range important for photosynthesis thanks to a special type of glass and an anti-reflective coating. Moreover, [[ultraviolet|UV-B rays]] can pass through the glass panels. The [[Carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] concentration can be increased and decreased in two chambers, the [[humidity]] can be varied, and the temperatures can be kept at 25&amp;nbsp;°C, even in summer when the sun is constantly shining. Scientists at the Institute of Chemistry and Dynamics of the [[Geosphere]] - Phytosphere (ICG-III) simulate different climate scenarios here and investigate their influence on the key processes in plants, such as growth, transport, exchange processes with the atmosphere and soil, and biotic interactions.

=== Beamlines at synchrotrons ===
The Peter Grünberg Institute (PGI) supports a number of beamlines for research with synchrotron radiation at various synchrotrons:
* BL5 U-250-PGM at [[Delta (research lab)|DELTA]] (Dortmund)
* UE56/1-SGM at [[BESSY]] (Berlin)
* MuCAT at APS (Argonne, USA)
* JUSIFA at [[HASYLAB]] (Hamburg)
* NanoESCA beamline [[Elettra]] (Trieste, Italy)

== Further research projects at Forschungszentrum Jülich ==

=== CLaMS: Atmosphere Model for Climate Research ===
Understanding the chemical processes in the atmosphere is the basis of many climate models. 
Environmental researchers at Forschungszentrum Jülich investigate the chemistry of the atmosphere with airplanes, balloons and satellites. 
They use their findings to generate chemical models such as [[CLaMS]], which are then used in simulations on supercomputers.

=== MEM-BRAIN: carbon dioxide separation  ===
Together with its research partners, Forschungszentrum Jülich is developing ceramic membranes. These membranes could be put to use as filters in power plants, which would separate process gases and effectively retain carbon dioxide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.co2separation.de/|title=CO2Separation|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== UNICORE: easy access to computing resources ===
Today, computing and storage resources are often split between a number of computer systems, computer centres or even between different countries. Science and industry therefore need tools that will allow easy and secure access to these resources. UNICORE [https://web.archive.org/web/20070811215938/http://www.fz-juelich.de/zam/grid/] from Jülich is one such [[Grid computing|grid-based]] software package.

== Infrastructure ==
As well as research institutions and large-scale facilities, Forschungszentrum Jülich has a variety of infrastructure units and central institutions that it needs for its day-to-day operations, including:

* Finance and Controlling Division (F)
* Personnel Division (P)
* Legal and Patent Division (R)
* Operation Management Division (B)
* Safety and Radiation Protection Division (S)

'''Goguryeo art''' is the art of [[Goguryeo]], an ancient [[Korea]]n kingdom (37 BCE &amp;ndash; 668 CE) which occupied large areas of present-day [[Northeast China]] and [[Korea]]. Its distinct style is marked by flowing lines and vivid colors.  The prime examples of this style are [[Complex of Goguryeo Tombs|tomb murals]] excavated in [[North Korea]] and [[Manchuria]], which were produced from the 3rd to 7th centuries.

'''HLA-NET''' is a network targeted to the study of [[Human leukocyte antigen]] (HLA) from a [[population genetics|populational]] point of view. The network was initiated by [[COST]] Action BM0803&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cost.eu/domains_actions/bmbs/Actions/BM0803 Action page] on COST official site&lt;/ref&gt; in January 2009. Currently [http://hla-net.eu HLA-NET] activities are being coordinated by a subcommittee of the scientific committee of the  [[European Federation for Immunogenetics]].

==The project==

The guidelines also include rules for the validation of samples and suggests minimal requirements for data analysis. The [http://hla-net.eu HLA-NET portal] provides an interface to software implementing these guidelines.

===Particularities of HLA data===

==HLA-NET guidelines==

===Population description===
HLA-NET main recommendations for population characterization have been published.&lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; Most notably, outdated racial/ethnical and meaningless terms have to be replaced by an acceptable terminology to describe populations (i.e. geographical and cultural criteria). 
An electronic population questionnaire for field studies is available on the [http://hla-net.eu/wiki_spa/doku.php?id=wg1:population_questionnaire HLA-NET portal].

===Obtaining and reporting data===
HLA-NET defined standards for producing high quality data for HLA genotyping and proposed [http://hla-net.eu/wiki_spa/doku.php?id=wg2:guidelines guidelines for reporting typing ambiguities]. A best suitable format for optimal allelic and haplotypic HLA frequency estimations, based on the list of allele pairs that account for the genotyping information, has been published.&lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; Other formats that allow to express ambiguities without simplifying the data can also be used.

===Validation of data sets===
[[Sample (statistics)|Sample]]s are used to provide [[allele frequency]] estimates for populations. For HLA [[Locus (genetics)|''loci'']], the presence of ambiguities and that of putative recessive-like undetected alleles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nunes|first=JM|author2=Riccio, ME |author3=Tiercy, JM |author4= Sanchez-Mazas, A |title=Allele frequency estimation from ambiguous data: using resampling schema in validating frequency estimates and in selective neutrality testing.|journal=Human Biology|date=Jun 2011|volume=83|issue=3|pages=437–47|pmid=21740157|url=http://archive-ouverte.unige.ch/unige:16925|doi=10.3378/027.083.0307}}&lt;/ref&gt; require the assumption of [[Hardy-Weinberg]]. HLA-NET explicitly requests that frequency estimates, for alleles or haplotypes, be validated by checking their conformity with Hardy-Weinberg expectations. If Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium is rejected then the frequencies can not be taken as representative of the population. The causes for deviation should be looked for &lt;ref name=Guidelines-IJIG /&gt; and, if possible, addressed. In any case, non Hardy-Weinberg frequencies should never be used as valid population estimates.

===Data analysis===

==HLA-NET results==
Besides the guidelines above, the HLA-NET network made a contributions in the following areas

===Usability of registry data===
Registries have moderate to huge data sets, but the recruitment often is not performed in such a way that registry data can be considered as representative of the population. However, under certain conditions, it is possible to assess if a given registry might be used as a population sample or not. Undergoing work is being conducted to formalise the constraints and the procedures required to use registry data as a proxy to population samples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anthropological aspects of BMD Registries|url=http://www.efiweb.eu/fileadmin/user_upload/pdf_nl/issue_70.pdf#13|work=EFI Newsletter - Issue 70|accessdate=7 June 2013|author=Constantia Voniatis Papaioannou!|author2=Alicia Sanchez-Mazas|date=April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1962">'''International Student/Young Pugwash''' ('''ISYP''') is an [[international organization]] that promotes awareness and action among students and young professionals in relation to [[ethics|ethical]] implications of science and technology [[science policy|policy]], particularly matters of [[international security]] and [[weapons of mass destruction]]. It developed from the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]].

==History==
Students have been invited as participants in Pugwash Conferences since the early 1970s. Following interest to create a forum specifically for students, student/young Pugwash groups started to form in the late 70s, [[Student Pugwash USA]] doing so in 1979. International collaboration among the groups began in 1988 in the [[Netherlands]] for the first jointly organized IS/YP conference. Student pre-conferences to the annual Pugwash Conferences began at the 1997 Pugwash Conference held in [[Norway]].

==Organization==
ISYP's members comprise national groups, which themselves may comprise loose or formal collections of [[school]] or [[university]] chapters. National entities include [[Student Pugwash USA]] (SPUSA), the largest, and Student Pugwash UK (SPUK) among others.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9789">'''Islamic bioethics''', or Islamic [[medical ethics]], ({{lang-ar|الأخلاق الطبية}} ''al-akhlaq al-tibbiyyah'') refers to Islamic guidance on [[ethics|ethical]] or [[morality|moral]] issues relating to medical and scientific fields, in particular, those dealing with human life.&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction ==
In Islam, human life is regarded as an invaluable gift from [[Allah|God]], and should therefore be both respected and protected.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24.&lt;/ref&gt; This is evident in many [[Qur’an]]ic verses or ''[[ayat]]'', one of the most important being:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"if anyone slays a human being, unless it be [in punishment] for murder or spreading corruption on earth, it shall be as though he had slain all mankind; whereas, if anyone saves a life, it shall be as though he had saved the lives of all mankind."(Qur’an 5:32)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is this verse which has ultimately fueled the interest in Islamic bioethics and within it exist two basic principles which ensure that the sanctity of human life is preserved:
# Saving a life is obligatory.
# Unjustified taking of a life is classified as [[murder]] and, thus, forbidden.

Though [[Muslim]]s recognize and maintain that Allah is the ultimate source of life (Qur’an 2:258), the Qur’an illustrates that God has instilled in them [[reason]], [[free will]], the ability to distinguish between what is morally acceptable and what is unacceptable (Qur’an 91:8) while also supplying the provisions of nature (Qur’an 45:13).&lt;ref name="Shomali, Mohammad Ali 2008"/&gt; With these things, Muslims are held responsible for maintaining health and preventing illness. In the event that illness occurs, Muslims are obliged to seek medical treatment in a manner which is Islamically appropriate and permissible.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Sources==
The fundamental basis of Islamic bioethics is that all rulings and actions must fall into accordance with Islamic law ([[shari’a]]) and [[Islamic ethics]]. By evaluating bioethical issues from and ethical and legal standpoint, jurists can issue decrees or [[fatwa]]s regarding the permissibility of the pertaining subject. Any rule that has not been explicitly outlined in the religious texts or formulated from them by jurists is referred to as [[bid‘ah]] (innovation) and, therefore, is [[haram]] (impermissible).&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, all medical procedures and treatments, as well as conduct between patient and medical professional must be legitimized by the sources of Islamic law, 

* Qur’an,
* [[Hadith]] or [[Sunnah]]
* [[Ijtihad]]
** In [[Sunni]] Islam, ijtihad includes [[qiyas]] (analogy), [[ijma]] (consensus), [[maslaha]] (public welfare) and ‘[[urf]] (customary practice)
** In [[Shi’a]] Islam it is composed solely of al-[['aql]] (reason)

==Principles==
Principles of [[bioethics]] in the Western world were first developed and outlined by two American philosophers and bioethicists, [[Tom Beauchamp]] and [[James F. Childress]], in their book, ''Principles of Biomedical Ethics''. The concept of bioethical principles has since been regarded as a purely “Western” innovation which is absent in the Islamic health care system.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; These bioethical principles: [[autonomy]], [[Beneficence (ethics)|beneficence]], [[non-maleficence]] and [[justice]] have been legitimized by Muslims jurists as falling into the sphere of Islamic law and have also been supported by Qur’anic verses (Qur'an 3:104, 16:90 and 17:70). They have subsequently become the foundational spirit underlying the ''Oath of the Muslim Doctor'' [http://www.islamset.com/ethics/code/oath.html] and, thus, dictate the conduct between a Muslim physician and his or her patient.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Hathery, Shabib. "The Muslim Doctor: Duties and Responsibilities." ''Islamic Medical Association Conference, Dammam, Saudi Arabia.'' Ed. Khan, Y. and H. Bouagada. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authority ==
Formulations of rulings on bioethical issues in the Islamic context generally arise due to some form of deliberation between medical professionals and religious authority who have been recognized as most qualified individuals of location or time period.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-14.&lt;/ref&gt; After being approached by health care officials, a member of the religious authority ([[mufti]]) may then consult the religious texts and determine whether or not a specific issue is obligatory ([[wajib]]/[[fard]]), recommended ([[mustahabb]]), neutral ([[mubah]]), discouraged ([[makruh]]) or forbidden ([[haram]]).&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernity==
As health care and science have progressed over time, and the Muslim population has also increased to over one billion adherents over every continent on the globe, there have been increasingly prevalent circumstances for the evaluation of technological applications and bioethical issues to determine how they fit into the Islamic sphere. As a result, larger bodies of Islamic committees have been formed to address issues at hand. National Committees of Medical Ethics/Bioethics have been formed in many [[Islamic countries]] which work together with [[ulema]] to issue fatwas ensuring that neither the progress of medical science is hindered, nor the Islamic code of [[bioethics]] is jeopardized.&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of Islamic law (sharia’) is so heavily valued that each issue is looked at independently and subsequently deemed permissible or impermissible. Specific issues addressed in the modern scientific era include [[abortion]], [[fertility treatment]]s, [[family planning]], [[euthanasia]], [[genetic research]], [[cloning]], [[stem cell research]] among many other issues.&lt;ref&gt;Shomali, Mohammad Ali. "Islamic Bioethics: A General Scheme." Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine. 1.1 (2008): 1-8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Younis, Huda. "Islamic Bioethics." O&amp;G Magazine Winter 2008: 24-26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Atighetchi, Darius. Islamic Bioethics: Problems and Perspectives. 31. Springer, 2007. 13-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics Project==
The [http://engage.bioethics.georgetown.edu/imse Islamic Medical and Scientific Ethics (IMSE) Project] is a multinational effort to produce a comprehensive collection of Islamic bioethics resources.&lt;ref&gt;http://bioethics.georgetown.edu/collections/islamic/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Project staff members at two [[Georgetown University]] libraries, the [[Kennedy Institute of Ethics|Bioethics Research Library]] (Washington) and the [[Georgetown University School of Foreign Service in Qatar#Library|School of Foreign Service-Qatar Library]] (Doha), have already compiled over 1,000 relevant written works into the IMSE Special Collection and have entered them into the searchable IMSE Database. The IMSE Project is funded by the [[Qatar National Research Fund]] (QNRF), a member of the [[Qatar Foundation|Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.qnrf.org/nl/research_news/index.php?ELEMEID=1646&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''laptop orchestra''' ('''lork''' or '''LO''') or '''laptop ensemble''' ('''LE''') is a [[chamber music]] [[musical ensemble|ensemble]] consisting primarily of [[laptop]]s. Education based laptop orchestras include '''BLOrk''' ('''University of Colorado Boulder Laptop Orchestra'''), '''[[#CLOrk|CLOrk]]''' (Concordia Laptop Orchestra), '''CMLO''' ('''CMU Laptop Orchestra''', Carnegie Mellon), '''HELO''' ('''Huddersfield Experimental Laptop Orchestra'''), '''OLO''' ('''Oslo Laptop Orchestra'''&lt;!--University of Oslo and Norwegian Academy of Music--&gt;), '''[[#PLOrk|PLOrk]]''' (Princeton Laptop Orchestra), and '''SLOrk''' ('''Stanford Laptop Orchestra'''). City based laptop orchestras include '''BiLE''' ('''Birmingham Laptop Ensemble''') and '''MiLO''' ('''Milwaukee Laptop Orchestra''').

==CLOrk==
{{anchor|Clork|Concordia Laptop Orchestra}}
'''Concordia Laptop Orchestra''' ('''CLOrk''') is an ensemble of laptop performers, consisting of up to 25 members, based at [[Concordia University]]'s Music Department in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]],  Canada. Founded and directed by professor Eldad Tsabary, CLOrk specializes in networked and multidisciplinary performances and collaborations, such as with dance and video.&lt;ref name=gazette&gt;{{cite news|last=La Leggia|first=Stephanie|title=An orchestra made up of computers|url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/saturdayextra/story.html?id=84b639d4-f605-4ae3-9662-344317697d2e|newspaper=The Montreal Gazette|date=April 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Electro-Acoustic Ensemble''' is a laptop-based ensemble at [[Loyola University New Orleans]].  The ensemble was formed in January 2009 by professor Paul J. Botelho and is composed of thirteen performers.  Custom software instruments are developed for the ensemble primarily using the [[ChucK]] and [[Java (programming language)|Java]] programming languages.  The ensemble focuses on contemporary and classical [[Electro-acoustic music|electro-acoustic]] works and performs in a variety of situations with a special focus on [[Guerrilla theatre|guerrilla performance]].

===Notable performances===

''Futurist Manifesto'' was premiered at a guest lecture by philosopher [[Slavoj Žižek]] at Loyola University New Orleans on November 17, 2009.  The work was based on the manifest of the Italian [[Futurism|Futurists]] and included live recitation of the manifesto with computer manipulation.  This work was also performed at the [[New Orleans Museum of Art]] on April 1, 2011 as a part of the museum's ''Where Y'Art?'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artsneworleans.org/events_framed/detail/5358/IMA-Director-Maxwell-Anderson-at-NOMA-Where-YArt |title=Where Y’Art? at the New Orleans Museum of Art Friday April 1st |work=Arts New Orleans |accessdate=April 4, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110904111015/http://www.artsneworleans.org/events_framed/detail/5358/IMA-Director-Maxwell-Anderson-at-NOMA-Where-YArt |archivedate=September 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2009, the ensemble performed a twenty-four-hour meta-performance of [[Erik Satie]]'s ''[[Vexations]]'' at Loyola University New Orleans.  Notably, one audience member, pianist Michael Bennett, remained for the entire twenty-four hour performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.loyno.edu/news/laag/20091204/1849|title=Electro-Acoustic Ensemble gives 24-hour meta-performance|work = Loyola at a Glance|accessdate=April 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Princeton Laptop Orchestra''' (abbreviated '''PLOrk''') is an ensemble of [[computer]]-based meta-[[musical instrument|instruments]] at [[Princeton University]]. 
PLOrk is part of research at Princeton University that investigates ways in which the computer can be integrated into conventional music-making contexts while also radically transforming those contexts. The Princeton Laptop Orchestra is a group of 12–15 persons and uses the “[[orchestra]]” (in a very general sense) as a model.

Each PLOrk “instrument” consists of a laptop, a multi-channel hemispherical speaker, and a variety of “control” devices (keyboards, graphics tablets, sensors). The members of this ensemble act as performers, researchers, composers, and software developers.

===History===
PLOrk was co-founded in 2005&lt;ref&gt;Rossing, Thomas; ed. (2015). ''Springer Handbook of Acoustics'', p.773. Springer. {{ISBN|9781493907557}}.&lt;/ref&gt; by professors [[Perry Cook]] and [[Dan Trueman]], with graduate students Scott Smallwood and [[Ge Wang]], and funding and support from many Princeton University departments, organizations, and industrial affiliations.  Composers and performers from Princeton and elsewhere developed new pieces for the ensemble, including [[Paul Lansky]] (Professor of Music at Princeton), [[Brad Garton]] (Director of the Columbia Computer Music Center), [[Pauline Oliveros]], PLOrk co-founders Dan Trueman and Perry Cook, Scott Smallwood, Ge Wang, and others.  The new PLOrk gave its first performance on April 4, 2006, in Richardson Auditorium, Princeton University. Grammy-winning tabla player [[Zakir Hussain (musician)|Zakir Hussain]], renowned accordionist [[Pauline Oliveros]], and [[So Percussion]] also performed with the group. PLOrk has since performed at [[Dartmouth College]], the [http://www.eartotheearth.org/ Ear to the Earth] festival (produced by the Electronic Music Foundation), [http://ffmup.org ffmup] and elsewhere. Several scholarly articles describing the motivations for establishing such an ensemble, the issues involved in composing for laptop orchestra, and pedagogical concerns, are currently in press. PLOrk was first presented academically at the 2006 International Computer Music Conference in New Orleans.  The guest director of the PLOrk for 2007 was [[R. Luke DuBois]].

Since the beginning, PLOrk has made extensive use of [[ChucK]], a new music programming language created by Ge Wang and Perry Cook which allows the performers to develop new code both in preparation and in performance, and which serves as a primary teaching tool.

A number of composers from Princeton and elsewhere have been developing pieces for PLOrk that address the unconventional composition of the group.  PLOrk works closely with these composers on their pieces with the aim of developing them further and further exploring a new branch of computer music and new media musical composition and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technology===
There are 15 PLOrk stations. Each station consists of a laptop with audio software; a rack containing an 8-channel audio amplifier, a power conditioner, and other electronic components; and a custom-made 6-channel hemispherical speaker.  In April 2008, PLOrk began using a new hemispherical unit which combines the functionality of the old rack and speakers into one more portable device.  The laptops are Apple 12" powerbooks, or more recently, 14" Macbooks.  HCI devices include keyboard controllers, TriggerFinger interfaces, graphics tablets, Nintendo [[Wii]] remotes, and infrared, light, pressure, and tilt sensors.  Additional gears include sitting mats and pillows, laptop lapdesk, and gears for transportation.

The PLOrk ensemble uses a variety of commercial and open-source software.  Two [[audio programming languages]], [[ChucK]] and [[Max/MSP]] are primarily used for pedagogy and performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''Lusterware''' or '''Lustreware''' (respectively the US and all other English spellings) is a type of [[pottery]] or [[porcelain]] with a [[metal]]lic glaze that gives the effect of [[iridescence]], produced by metallic [[oxide]]s in an [[ceramic glaze|overglaze]] finish, which is given a second firing at a lower temperature in a "[[Muffle furnace|muffle kiln]]", [[redox|reduction]] [[kiln]], which excludes oxygen.

Lustre decoration was first used as a [[glass]]-painting technique.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/me/l/lustre_painted_bowl.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;  While some scholars see this as a purely Islamic invention originating in [[Fustat]],&lt;ref&gt;Pinder-Wilson, R. 1991. The Islamic Lands and China. In: H. Tait (ed.), Five Thousand Years of Glass. London: British Museum Press, 112-143; p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt; others place the origins of lustre decoration in Roman and [[Coptic Egypt]] during the centuries preceding the rise of [[Islam]].  Staining glass vessels with copper and silver pigments was known from around the 3rd century AD,&lt;ref&gt;Carboni, S. 2001. Glass from Islamic Lands.

Lustre glazes were applied to pottery in [[Mesopotamia]] in the 9th century; the technique later became popular in [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Syria]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ten thousand years of pottery'', Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, {{ISBN|0-8122-3554-1}}, pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Great Mosque of Kairouan]], [[Tunisia]], the upper part of the [[mihrab]] is adorned with polychrome and monochrome lusterware tiles; dating from 862 to 863, these tiles were most probably imported from Mesopotamia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=szNMwUFyjbkC&amp;pg=PA40 Catherine Hess, Linda Komaroff and George Saliba (2004), ''The arts of fire: Islamic influences on glass and ceramics of the Italian Renaissance'', Getty Publications, p. 40]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en Mihrab of the Great Mosque of Kairouan (Qantara mediterranean heritage)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303184012/http://www.qantara-med.org/qantara4/public/show_document.php?do_id=401&amp;lang=en |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Islam forbade the use of precious metal dishes and vessels for eating, which had been normal for pre-Islamic elites, and there was therefore a market for elaborate and expensive glass and ceramic equivalents.  The reminiscence of shining metal, especially gold, made lustreware especially attractive.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 24-31&lt;/ref&gt;

Lusterware was produced in quantity in [[Egypt]] during the [[Fatimid dynasty]] in the 10th–12th centuries. While the production of lusterware continued in the [[Middle East]], it spread to [[Europe]] through [[Al-Andalus]]. [[Málaga]] was the first centre of [[Hispano-Moresque ware]], before it developed in the region of [[Valencia]], and then to [[History of Islam in southern Italy|Italy]], where it was used to enhance [[maiolica]]. In the 16th century lustred maiolica was a specialty of [[Gubbio]], noted for a rich ruby red, and at [[Deruta]].&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, Chapters 6-8&lt;/ref&gt;

After a gap of several centuries in Persian production, it was revived in the [[Safavid]] period from about the 1630s, in a rather different style, typically producing small pieces with designs often in a dark copper colour over a dark blue (cobalt) background. Unlike other Persian wares of the period, these use traditional Middle Eastern shapes and decoration rather than Chinese-inspired ones, and also do not take their shapes from metalware. Designs featured plant forms and animals, and generally flowed freely over the whole surface, typically taking up over half the surface area.  Production, which was never large, appears to have mostly been from about 1650 to 1750, but with rather inferior wares produced into the 19th century.  It is often thought to have been centred in [[Kirman]], though firm evidence is lacking.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 80-84; Blair &amp; Bloom, 171&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern lustreware==
[[File:Clement massier.jpg|thumb|Lustreware vase by Clement [[:fr:Massier]], circa 1900]]
Metallic lustre of another sort produced English lustreware, which imparts to a piece of pottery the appearance of an object of silver, gold or copper. Silver lustre employed the new metal [[platinum]], whose chemical properties were analyzed towards the end of the 18th century, John Hancock of Hanley invented the application of a platinum technique, and "put it in practice at [[Josiah Spode|Mr Spode's manufactory]], for Messrs. Daniels and Brown",&lt;ref&gt;Hancock's memoir, quoted by Ross Taggart, ''The Frank P. and Harriet C. Burnap Collection of English Pottery in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery'', rev. ed. (Kansas City) 1967, p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; about 1800. Very dilute amounts of powdered gold or platinum were dissolved in [[aqua regia]]&lt;ref&gt;Aqua regia, a mixture of [[nitric acid|nitric]] and [[hydrochloric acid]].&lt;/ref&gt;  and added to spirits of tar for platinum and a mixture of turpentine, flowers of sulfur and linseed oil for gold.  The mixture was applied to the glazed ware and fired in an enameling kiln, depositing a thin film of platinum or gold.&lt;ref&gt;Technical description from Taggart 1967:168.&lt;/ref&gt;

Platinum produced the appearance of solid silver, and was employed for the middle class in shapes identical to those uses for silver [[tea service]]s, ca. 1810-1840.  Depending on the concentration of gold in the lustring compound and the under slip on which it was applied, a range of colours could be achieved, from pale rose and lavender, to copper and gold. The gold lustre could be painted or stenciled on the ware, or it could be applied in the resist technique, in which the background was solidly lustred, and the design remained in the body color. In the resist technique, similar to [[batik]], the design was painted in glue and size in a glycerin or honey compound, the lustre applied by dipping, and the resist washed off before the piece was fired.

Lustreware became popular in [[Staffordshire pottery]] during the 19th century, where it was also used by [[Josiah Wedgwood]], who introduced pink and white lustreware simulating mother o' pearl effects in dishes and bowls cast in the shapes of shells, and silver lustre, introduced at Wedgwood in 1805. In 1810 Peter Warburton of [[New Hall, Cambridge|New Hall]] patented a method of [[transfer-printing]] in gold and silver lustre. [[Sunderland Lustreware]] in the [[North East England|North East]] is renowned for its mottled pink lustreware, and lustreware was also produced in [[Leeds, Yorkshire]], where the technique may have been introduced by Thomas Lakin.&lt;ref&gt;Taggart 1967:169.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wedgwood's lusterware made in the 1820s spawned the production of mass quantities of copper and silver lustreware&lt;ref&gt;Silver was produced from platinum salts; fully lustred teasets imitating silver models were introduced in 1823 for middle-class households (L.G.G. Ramsey, ed. ''The Connoisseur New Guide to Antique English Pottery, Porcelain and Glass'' p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; in England and Wales. Cream pitchers with appliqué-detailed spouts and meticulously applied handles were most common, and often featured stylized decorative bands in dark blue, cream yellow, pink, and, most rare, dark green and purple. Raised, multicolored patterns depicting pastoral scenes were also created, and sand was sometimes incorporated into the glaze to add texture. Pitchers were produced in a range of sizes from cream pitchers to large milk pitchers, as well as small coffeepots and teapots. [[Tea set]]s came a bit later, usually featuring creamers, sugar bowls, and slop bowls.

Large pitchers with transfer printed commemorative scenes appear to have arrived around the middle of the 19th century. These were purely decorative and today command high prices because of their historical connections. Delicate lustre imitating [[mother-of-pearl]] was produced by Wedgwood and at [[Belleek Pottery|Belleek]] in the mid-century, derived from  [[bismuth nitrate]].&lt;ref&gt;John Fleming and Hugh Honour, ''Dictionary of the Decorative Arts'', 1977, ''s.v.'' "Lustre".&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the impetus of the [[Aesthetic Movement]], [[William de Morgan]] revived lustrewares in a manner drawing from lustred majolica and Hispano-Moresque wares, with fine, bold designs.&lt;ref&gt;Caiger-Smith, 168-170&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, copper lusterware became popular because of its lustrousness. Apparently, as gaslights became available to the rich, the fad was to place groupings of lusterware on mirror platforms to be used as centerpieces for dinner parties. Gaslights accentuated their lustrousness.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1498">The '''McIntire–Stennis Act of 1962''' (P.L. 87-788) makes funding available to the state agricultural experimental stations and to [[forestry school]]s and programs at the [[land grant colleges]] of agriculture for forestry research. The research covers such areas as [[reforestation]], woodlands and related [[Drainage basin|watershed]] management, outdoor recreation, [[wildlife habitat]]s and wood utilization. Many of the research projects are performed cooperatively with scientists at the laboratories of the [[United States Forest Service]].

[https://nifa.usda.gov/program/mcintire-stennis-capacity-grant McIntire-Stennis] funds are distributed by a formula that allocates $10,000 to each state, with 40% of the remainder being distributed according to a state’s share of the nation’s total commercial forest land, 40% according to the value of its timber cut annually, and 20% according to its state appropriation for forestry research.

'''''Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming''''' is a 2010 non-fiction book by American [[History of science|historians of science]] [[Naomi Oreskes]] and [[Erik M. Conway]]. It identifies parallels between the [[global warming controversy]] and earlier controversies over [[tobacco smoking]], [[acid rain]], [[DDT]], and the [[ozone depletion|hole in the ozone layer]]. Oreskes and Conway write that in each case "keeping the controversy alive" by spreading doubt and confusion after a scientific consensus had been reached, was the basic strategy of those opposing action.&lt;ref name = stek&gt;{{cite news |author=Steketee, Mike |title=Some sceptics make it a habit to be wrong |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/some-sceptics-make-it-a-habit-to-be-wrong/story-fn59niix-1225956414538 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |date=November 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, they say that [[Fred Seitz]], [[Fred Singer]], and a few other [[contrarian]] scientists joined forces with conservative [[think tank]]s and private corporations to challenge the scientific consensus on many contemporary issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Naomi |last1=Oreskes |first2=Erik M. |last2=Conway |title=Merchants of Doubt: How a Handful of Scientists Obscured the Truth on Issues from Tobacco Smoke to Global Warming |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fpMh3nh3JI0C&amp;pg=PP4 |year=2010 |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |isbn=978-1-59691-610-4 |page=6 |ref=harv}} [http://www.merchantsofdoubt.org/index.html merchantsofdoubt.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George C. Marshall Institute]] and Fred Singer, two of the subjects, have been critical of the book. Other reviewers have been more favorable. One reviewer said that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Another reviewer saw the book as his choice for best [[science book]] of the year.&lt;ref name=Mckie8/&gt; It was made into a film, ''[[Merchants of Doubt (film)|Merchants of Doubt]]'', directed by [[Robert Kenner]], released in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sonyclassics.com/merchantsofdoubt/ | title=Merchants of Doubt | publisher=Sony Pictures Classics | accessdate=March 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
[[File:S Fred Singer 2011.jpg |thumb|right |[[Fred Singer]] (2011), a prominent opponent of greenhouse gas regulation.]]
Oreskes  and Conway write that a handful of [[Conservatism in the United States|politically conservative]] scientists, with strong ties to particular industries, have "played a disproportionate role in debates about controversial questions".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; The authors write that this has resulted in "deliberate obfuscation" of the issues which has had an influence on [[Public opinion on climate change|public opinion]] and [[Climate change policy of the United States|policy-making]].&lt;ref name=pk&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kitcher, Philip |authorlink=Philip Kitcher |title=The Climate Change Debates |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=328 |issue=5983 |pages=1231–2 |date=June 4, 2010 |doi=10.1126/science.1189312 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/328/5983/1230-a }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book criticizes the so-called Merchants of Doubt, some predominantly American science key players, above all [[William Nierenberg|Bill Nierenberg]], [[Fred Seitz]], and [[Fred Singer]]. All three are physicists: Singer was a [[rocket scientist]], whereas Nierenberg and Seitz worked on the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name=sb&gt;{{cite news |author=Brown, Seth |title='Merchants of Doubt' delves into contrarian scientists |url=https://www.usatoday.com/money/books/reviews/2010-06-01-deathmerchants01_ST_N.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=May 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been active on topics like acid rain, tobacco smoking, global warming and pesticides. The book claims that these scientists have challenged and diluted the [[scientific consensus]] in the various fields, as of the [[dangers of smoking]], the effects of acid rain, the existence of the ozone hole, and the existence of [[anthropogenic climate change]].&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; Seitz and Singer have been involved with institutions such as [[The Heritage Foundation]], [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]] and [[George C. Marshall Institute]] in the United States. Funded by [[corporation]]s and conservative [[Foundation (United States law)|foundations]], these organizations have opposed many forms of [[Economic interventionism|state intervention]] or regulation of U.S. citizens. The book lists similar tactics in each case: "discredit the science, disseminate false information, spread confusion, and promote doubt".&lt;ref name=rm/&gt;

The book states that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and [[Robert Jastrow]] were all fiercely [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] and they viewed government regulation as a step towards [[socialism]] and [[communism]]. The authors argue that, with the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], they looked for another great threat to free market capitalism and found it in environmentalism. They feared that an over-reaction to environmental problems would lead to heavy-handed government intervention in the marketplace and intrusion into people's lives.&lt;ref name=ocmerch/&gt; Oreskes and Conway state that the longer the delay the worse these problems get, and the more likely it is that governments will need to take the draconian measures that conservatives and [[market fundamentalism|market fundamentalists]] most fear. They say that Seitz, Singer, Nierenberg and Jastrow denied the scientific evidence, contributed to a strategy of delay, and thereby helped to bring about the situation they most dreaded.&lt;ref name=ocmerch&gt;{{harvnb|Oreskes|Conway|2010|pp=248–255}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have a strong doubt about the ability of the media to differentiate between false truth and the actual science in question; however, they stop short of endorsing censorship in the name of science.&lt;ref name ="RG" /&gt; The journalistic norm of balanced reporting has helped, according to the authors, to amplify the misleading messages of the contrarians. Oreskes and Conway state: "small numbers of people can have large, negative impacts, especially if they are organised, determined and have access to power".&lt;ref name=rm&gt;{{cite news |author=McKie, Robin |title=A dark ideology is driving those who deny climate change |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/aug/01/climate-change-robin-mckie |newspaper=The Guardian |date=August 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main conclusion of the book is that there would have been more progress in policymaking, if not for the influence of the contrarian "experts", which tried on ideological reasons to undermine trust in the science base for regulation.&lt;ref name="RG"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grundmann|first1=Reiner|title=Debunking sceptical propaganda|journal=BioSocieties|date=29 August 2013|volume=8|issue=3|pages=370–374|doi=10.1057/biosoc.2013.15|url=https://www.academia.edu/4754580/Debunking_skeptical_propaganda_Book_review_of_Oreskes_Conway_Merchants_of_Doubt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar conclusions were already drawn, among others on [[Frederick Seitz]] and [[William Nierenberg]] in the book ''[[Requiem for a Species|Requiem for a Species: Why We Resist the Truth about Climate Change]]'' (2010) by Australian academic [[Clive Hamilton]].

==Reception==

[[Philip Kitcher]] in ''[[Science (magazine)|Science]]'' says that Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway are "two outstanding historians".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt; He calls ''Merchants of Doubt'' a "fascinating and important study". Kitcher says that the apparently harsh claims against Nierenberg, Seitz, and Singer are "justified through a powerful dissection of the ways in which prominent climate scientists, such as [[Roger Revelle]] and [[Ben Santer]], were exploited or viciously attacked in the press".&lt;ref name=pk/&gt;

In ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]'', Will Buchanan says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is exhaustively researched and documented, and may be one of the most important books of 2010. Oreskes and Conway are seen to demonstrate that the doubt merchants are not "objective scientists" as the term is popularly understood. Instead, they are "science-speaking mercenaries" hired by corporations to process numbers to prove that the corporations’ products are safe and useful. Buchanan says they are salesmen, not scientists.&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, Will (June 22, 2010). [http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/Book-Reviews/2010/0622/Merchants-of-Doubt Merchants of Doubt: How “scientific” misinformation campaigns sold untruths to consumers] ''The Christian Science Monitor''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bud Ward published a review of the book in ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''. He wrote that Oreskes and Conway use a combination of thorough scholarly research combined with writing reminiscent of the best investigative journalism, to "unravel deep common links to past environmental and public health controversies".&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;Ward, Bud (July 8, 2010). [http://www.yaleclimatemediaforum.org/2010/07/merchants-of-doubt/ Reviews: Leaving No Doubt on Tobacco, Acid Rain, Climate Change], ''The Yale Forum on Climate and the Media''.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of climate science, the authors' leave "little doubt about their disdain for what they regard as the misuse and abuse of science by a small cabal of scientists they see as largely lacking in requisite climate science expertise".&lt;ref name="Ward" /&gt;

Phil England writes in ''[[The Ecologist]]'' that the strength of the book is the rigour of the research and the detailed focus on key incidents. He said, however, that the climate change chapter is only 50 pages long, and recommends several other books for readers who want to get a broader picture of this aspect: [[Jim Hoggan]]’s ''Climate Cover-Up'', [[George Monbiot]]’s ''Heat: How to Stop the Planet Burning'' and [[Ross Gelbspan]]’s ''The Heat is On'' and ''Boiling Point''. England also said that there is little coverage about the millions of dollars which [[Exxon Mobil]] has put into funding groups actively involved in promoting [[climate change denial]] and doubt.&lt;ref&gt;England, Phil (September 10, 2010). [http://www.theecologist.org/reviews/books/592288/merchants_of_doubt.html Merchants of Doubt] ''[[The Ecologist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review in ''[[The Economist]]'' calls this a powerful book which articulates the politics involved and the degree to which scientists have sometimes manufactured and exaggerated environmental uncertainties, but opines that the authors fail to fully explain how environmental action has still often proved possible despite countervailing factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/16374460 All guns blazing: A question of dodgy science], (June 17, 2010), ''[[The Economist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert N. Proctor]], who coined the term "[[agnotology]]" to describe the study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt, wrote in ''[[American Scientist]]'' that ''Merchants of Doubt'' is a detailed and artfully written book. He set it in the context of other books which cover the "history of manufactured ignorance":&lt;ref name="Proctor"&gt;Proctor, Robert (September–October 2010). [http://www.americanscientist.org/bookshelf/pub/manufactured-ignorance Book Review: Manufactured Ignorance], ''[[American Scientist]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Michaels (epidemiologist)|David Michaels]]’s ''[[Doubt is their Product]]'' (2008), [[Chris Mooney (journalist)|Chris Mooney]]’s ''[[The Republican War on Science]]'' (2009), [[David Rosner]] and Gerald Markowitz’s ''[[Deceit and Denial]]'' (2002), and his own book ''[[Cancer Wars]]'' (1995).&lt;ref name="Proctor" /&gt;

Robin McKie in ''[[The Guardian]]'' states that Oreskes and Conway deserve considerable praise for exposing the influence of a small group of [[Cold War]] ideologues. Their tactic of spreading doubt has confused the public about a series of key scientific issues such as global warming, even though scientists have actually become more certain about their research results. McKie says that ''Merchants of Doubt'' includes detailed notes on all sources used, is carefully paced, and is "my runaway contender for best science book of the year".&lt;ref name=Mckie8&gt;McKie, Robin (August 8, 2010). [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/aug/08/merchants-of-doubt-oreskes-conway "Merchants of Doubt by Naomi Oreskes and Erik M Conway".] ''The Guardian''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sociologist [[Reiner Grundmann]]'s review in ''[[BioSocieties]]'' journal, acknowledges that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in a black and white manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of [[knowledge policy]], because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides ''all the (formal) hallmarks of science'', Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.&lt;ref name="RG" /&gt;

William O’Keefe and Jeff Kueter from the [[George C. Marshall Institute]], which was founded by Seitz,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Begley|first1=Sharon|title=Global Warming Deniers: A Well-Funded Machine|url=http://www.newsweek.com/global-warming-deniers-well-funded-machine-99295|website=Newsweek|date=4 August 2007|quote=...a central cog in the denial machine: the George C. Marshall Institute, a conservative think tank.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  say that although ''Merchants of Doubt'' has the appearance of a scholarly work, it discredits and undermines the reputations of people who in their lifetime contributed greatly to the American nation. They say that it does this by questioning their integrity, impugning their character, and questioning their judgement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=O’Keefe | first= William |last2= Kueter| first2=Jeff | date=June 2010 | url=http://marshall.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/OKeefe-and-Kueter-Clouding-the-Truth-A-Critique-of-Merchants-of-Doubt.pdf |title=Clouding the Truth: A Critique of Merchants of Doubt |publisher=[[George C. Marshall Institute]] |work=Policy Outlook | quote=Although cloaked in the appearance of scholarly work, the book constitutes an effort to discredit and undermine the reputations of three deceased scientists who contributed greatly to our nation...

'''NHK Science &amp; Technical Research Laboratories''' ('''STRL''', ''Japanese:'' NHK放送技術研究所, NHK Hōsō Gijutsu Kenkyūjo), headquartered in [[Setagaya, Tokyo]], [[Japan]], is responsible for technical research at [[NHK]], Japan's public broadcaster.

Work done by the STRL includes research on [[direct-broadcast satellite]] ([[Yuri (satellite)|BS]]), [[ISDB|Integrated Services Digital Broadcasting]], [[high-definition television]], and [[ultra high definition television]].

'''New Pedestrianism''' ('''NP''') is a more pedestrian and ecology-oriented variation of [[New Urbanism]] in urban planning theory, founded in 1999 by [[Michael E. Arth]], an American artist, urban/home/landscape designer, futurist, and author. NP addresses the problems associated with New Urbanism and is an attempt to solve various social, health, energy, economic, aesthetic, and environmental problems, with special focus on reducing the role of the automobile.&lt;ref name="digbyhall120.wordpress.com"&gt;Digby Hall, "New Urbanism vs. New Pedestrianism," Green Futures, October 9, 2013 [https://digbyhall120.wordpress.com/2013/10/09/new-urbanism-vs-new-pedestrianism/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amerika.org/darwinism/new-fascinating-ideas-new-pedestrianism/Frank Azzurro, Amerika, "New Pedestrianism"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://beltlandia.com/will-the-beltline-birth-new-pedestrianism/Burke Sisco, Beltlandia, "Will the BelLine Birth New Pedestrianism?"]&lt;/ref&gt;A neighborhood or new town utilizing NP is called a [[Pedestrian Village]]. Pedestrian Villages can range from being nearly car-free to having automobile access behind nearly every house and business, but pedestrian lanes are always in front.&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010 pp. 120-139"&gt;Arth, Michael E. (2010). ''Democracy and the Common Wealth: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'' Golden Apples Media, {{ISBN|978-0-912467-12-2}}. pp. 120-139, 363-386&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelearth.com/democracy/ Website about ''Democracy and the Common Wealth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules"&gt;Michael E. Arth, ''The Labors of Hercules: Modern Solutions to 12 Herculean Problems.'' 2007 Online edition. [http://michaelearth.com/herc_IX.htm Labor IX: Urbanism]&lt;/ref&gt;

To a large extent New Urbanism is a revival of traditional street patterns and urban design. New Pedestrianism also respects traditional town design, but seeks to further reduce the negative impact of the automobile, the use of which has increased dramatically since WWII. By eliminating the front street and replacing it with a tree-lined pedestrian lane, emphasis is placed on low-impact alternative travel such as walking and cycling. Pedestrian lanes are usually 12 to {{convert|15|ft|m|0}} wide, with one smooth side for rolling conveyances such as bicycles, [[Segways]], and skates and the other, narrower, textured side for pedestrians and wheelchairs. Eliminating the automobile street from the front allows for intimate scale plazas, fountains, pocket parks, as well as an unspoiled connection to natural features such as lakes, streams, and forests that may border or be included in a Pedestrian Village. A vast public realm is created that is free from the sight, smell, and sound of automobiles, yet automobiles are still served on a separate network.&lt;ref name="digbyhall120.wordpress.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pedestrianvillages.com/ New Pedestrianism information]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth, "Pedestrian Villages are the Antidote to Sprawl" The DeLand-Deltona Beacon, May 29, 2003. Page 1D.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris Sullivan, "Town designer solves problem areas." Daytona Beach News-Journal, January 15, 2006, p. 10H.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
New Pedestrianism has been proposed for Kisima Kaya, a new town in [[Kenya]], for Tiger Bay Village, FL as a solution to the homeless problem, and for new towns and neighborhoods that can be built anywhere whether as rehabilitation of existing neighborhoods, infill, edge-of-town neighborhoods, or new towns.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

==The automobile==

To a large extent, NP is a reaction to the way in which the automobile has affected the environment and reshaped the cities. Arth writes: “Our quality of life is dependent on achieving a spectrum of physical and psychological needs in a clean, safe, and beautiful environment that can only be accomplished with highly integrated urban design and planning. As long as vehicles, roads, parking lots, garages, and automobile-related businesses cover a significant portion of the landscape and determine the design of nearly everything else, most American cities will continue to be dysfunctional and degraded slumscapes, choked with traffic.”&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;
[[File:401 Gridlock.jpg|thumb|300px|North American cities can suffer chronic [[traffic congestion]] despite the width of the highways.]]
Over six million motor vehicle related accidents result in almost three million injuries, and over 42,000 deaths each year in the United States alone. Worldwide, approximately half a million deaths occur each year from motor vehicle accidents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/ National Highway &amp; Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Over-reliance on the automobile, coupled with the lack of a pedestrian-friendly environment, has contributed to two-thirds of adult Americans being overweight or obese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transact.org/ Surface Transportation Policy Project]&lt;/ref&gt;  
Americans spend about $33 billion a year trying to lose weight.  Degradation of the urban and rural landscape caused by sprawl also has wide-ranging negative effects on the environment and contributes to high maintenance costs to the infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ National Center for Health Statistics]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Americans spend as much of their income on transportation as on housing, with residents of more automobile-dependent cities spending as much as three times as much of their Gross Regional Product (GRP). People in Houston, Atlanta, Dallas-Ft.Worth spend about 23% of their GRP on transportation compared to 9% in Honolulu, New York City, and Baltimore, and 7% in Toronto. These statistics are from the late 90’s before the huge runup in oil prices, and do not include some of the hidden costs of oil consumption.&lt;ref&gt;The [[International Center for Technology Assessment]], "[http://www.icta.org/doc/rpg%20execsum.pdf/ The Real Price of Gasoline, Executive Summary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070609130714/http://www.icta.org/doc/rpg%20execsum.pdf |date=2007-06-09 }}" 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy==

New Pedestrianism, in its ideal form, reduces the need for oil and other limited energy sources by reducing consumption and utilizing renewable energy. It is anticipated, especially as the cost of photovoltaic cells drops, that individual homes would be equipped with solar panels and solar water heaters, and that solar parks would harvest energy for the whole community. Reducing energy needs and moving away from oil dependency would presumably address health, social, economic, and environmental problems.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

==Aesthetics==

New Pedestrianism replaces front streets with tree-lined pedestrian lanes that form a linear park system that directly connects all homes and businesses to each other, as well as to parks, greenbelts, plazas, courtyards, water features, schools, recreation, and other amenities. This presumably raises the value of all property because the public and private properties are no longer devalued by the appearance and danger of excessive [[automobile dependency]]. A separate, tree-lined, street grid for cars also exists, but it is always relegated to the rear, and the pedestrian/bike grid as the primary transportation network ensures that unsightly, noisome, and often noisy traffic is vastly reduced on the rear streets. In Pedestrian Villages, density increases because buildings can be built close to quiet, car-free lanes without the need for huge setbacks that are typical in suburban sprawl. This, in turn, places more emphasis on building design, peaceful and intimate public spaces, and aesthetics that is scaled for pedestrians.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

== History ==

Like New Urbanism, New Pedestrianism has its roots in compact, mixed-use neighborhoods common in the United States (and elsewhere) during and prior to the first quarter of the 20th century. New Pedestrianism borrows and then expands upon earlier experiments in urban design that focused on separating pedestrians from vehicular traffic.

[[Image:Venice Walk Street.png|right|thumb|300px|A walk street in Venice, California, built around 1905.]]

In a few beachside communities in Southern California, including [[Venice, California]], "walk streets" were constructed around 1905 in a few blocks near the beach. Houses faced pedestrian lanes that ranged between 3 and 10  feet wide.  Narrow alleys in the rear handled cars and parking. The canals in Venice, California, built during the same period, also had both sidewalks and canals in front of the houses.&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;

Urban planners [[Ebenezer Howard]] and [[Sir Patrick Geddes]] were an earlier influence on the design of [[Radburn, New Jersey]], built at the dawn of the automobile age in 1929. Radburn had pedestrian lanes in front and vehicular access at the rear on cul-de-sacs that protruded into large multi-use blocks. A study done in 1970 by John Lansing of the University of Michigan showed that 47% of its residents did their grocery shopping on foot, compared to 8% for a conventional subdivision nearby. He also determined that, overall, Radburn residents drove far less than in any other areas he studied. The Radburn plan has been copied in various forms in Sweden, England, Japan, New Zealand, and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;John B. Lansing, Robert W. Marans and Robert B. Zehner, ''Planned Residential Environments'' (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 1970), p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Antonio River Walk]], also known as "Paseo del Rio," was initiated in 1929. In this case, the San Antonio River underwent flood control measures and was turned into a peaceful canal lined on both sides with lively pedestrian promenades, plazas, sidewalk cafes, restaurants, clubs, shops, hotels, and other attractions that are completely separate from any vehicles. The promenades pass underneath the roads since Paseo del Rio is one level below the street and vehicular access to buildings is one story above the river.

Village Homes in [[Davis, California]] was founded in 1975 by Michael and Judy Corbett. The {{convert|70|acre|m2|sing=on}} subdivision has 225 homes and 20 apartments. Solar design and solar panels are utilized for heating. The homes have walkways passing through an extensive greenbelt system on one side of the houses with automobile access on the other side.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagehomesdavis.org Village Homes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some streets in the New Urbanist development of [[Rosemary Beach, Florida]] also have boardwalks in front of some of the homes.

In 2005 New Pedestrianism was offered by Arth as part of the solution to the rebuilding of [[New Orleans]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth "New Orleans is Opportunity for Better Urban Planning," The Dayton News-Journal, Section B, October 30, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael E. Arth "[http://www.seasidefl.com/newsStory.asp?releaseId=1047/ New Orleans Offers Chance for Better Planning] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928090541/http://www.seasidefl.com/newsStory.asp?releaseId=1047%2F |date=2007-09-28 }}"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media about New Pedestrianism==
''[[Democracy and the Common Wealth]]: Breaking the Stranglehold of the Special Interests'' (2010), by Michael E. Arth, gives a comprehensive assessment of society and how New Pedestrianism fits into the overall scheme of things. There are also many illustrations and photographs, and a section called "Anatomy of a Pedestrian Village."&lt;ref name="Arth, Michael E. 2010 pp. 120-139"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelearth.com/democracy/|website=MichaelEarth.com|title=Democracy and the Common Wealth}} A website about the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[New Urban Cowboy: Toward a New Pedestrianism]]'' (produced in 2008) is a feature-length documentary that tells the story of Arth's struggle to retrofit a crack slum into a Pedestrian Village while also explaining the philosophy of New Pedestrianism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=GoldenApplesMedia.com|url=http://GoldenApplesMedia.com/  |title=New Urban Cowboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=www.newurbancowboy.com|website=NewUrbanCowboy.com|title=New Urban Cowboy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

These are examples of New Pedestrianism-style [[pedestrian village]]s that represent the various types:&lt;ref name="laborsofhercules" /&gt;
* [[Copenhagen]], Denmark - Central city is auto free and bicycle friendly. 
*  [[DeLand, Florida]], USA - (Historic Garden District, downtown)- Infill retrofit of existing neighborhood, 2001-2007.
* [[Dubrovnik]], Croatia - The historic district is entirely car free. 
* [[Ghent]], Belgium] - The entire city core is car free, except for limited motor vehicle access with 5&amp;nbsp;km/h speed limit.
*   [[Louvain-la-Neuve]], Belgium -  Pedestrian university town with parking hidden below, 1969. 
*  [[Mackinac Island]], Michigan, USA - While not created with the specific idea of New Pedestrianism in mind, the island has 523 permanent residents and attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists per year.  Except for service and emergency vehicles no motorized vehicles have been allowed on the island since the end of the 1800s.
*  [[Masdar City]], Abu Dhabi, UAE - motor vehicles and public transit are completely separated on a lower level from the pedestrians. Narrow pedestrian lanes and plazas are car-free. Parking is outside the city. 
*[[San Antonio River Walk]], Texas, USA - Car-free promenade, 1920s.
*  Tiger Bay Village, Florida, USA - Proposed, nearly-car-free Pedestrian Village as a solution to homelessness, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.villagesforthehomeless.org/ Villages for the Homeless website]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Venice, California]], USA - Walking streets with and without canals, and a car-free promenade, circa 1910. 
* [[Venice, Italy]] - Entirely car free. Walkways, plazas and canals only.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8169">'''Placebo studies''' is an [[interdisciplinary]] academic discipline concerning the study of the [[placebo effect]]. The [[placebo effect]] is commonly characterized when patients are given a [[placebo]] or "fake" treatment and then exhibit  perceived improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Thompson JJ, Ritenbaugh C, Nichter M | title = Reconsidering the placebo response from a broad anthropological perspectives | journal = Culture, Medicine and Psychiatry | volume = 33 | issue = 1 | pages = 112–52 | date = March 2009 | pmid = 19107582 | pmc = 2730465 | doi = 10.1007/s11013-008-9122-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This discipline was pioneered by [[Ted Kaptchuk]] and colleagues at the [[Program in Placebo Studies]] at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]] and the [[Harvard Medical School]].

==Background==
Until 1955, a [[placebo]] treatment was considered a fraudulent substance administered to appease difficult patients.&lt;ref name=kaptchuk&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kaptchuk TJ, Kelley JM, Deykin A, Wayne PM, Lasagna LC, Epstein IO, Kirsch I, Wechsler ME | title = Do "placebo responders" exist? | journal = Contemporary Clinical Trials | volume = 29 | issue = 4 | pages = 587–95 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18378192 | doi = 10.1016/j.cct.2008.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the defintion for Placeo has changed its connotation over the years, idealy it has come to mean the false effects are belived to be true by one's expectations. Although, it is a false substance used to satisfy one's ilness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu/eds/detail/detail?vid=3&amp;sid=47b60c2f-3a13-45e2-82eb-fb70092f29f2@sessionmgr4006&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWRzLWxpdmUmc2NvcGU9c2l0ZQ==#AN=89408012&amp;db=ers|title=Login - Sam Houston State University|website=eds.a.ebscohost.com.ezproxy.shsu.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;However, the rise of the placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial (RCT), it became widely known throughout the academic community that [[placebo]] effects could in fact result in clinical changes and results.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; However, the ability to distinguish the efficacious ability of placebos over a period of time as well as those who are coined responders has proven difficult for scientists.&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt;

== Double-blind ==
A [[Double-blind placebo-controlled trial|double-blind placebo]] is called so when neither the researcher nor the patients know who was given which form of treatment.  This is the most used form of the placebo methods. It differs from a single controled [[placebo]], in that the researchers actually know what patients are given which form of therapy.&lt;ref name="Moher-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG | title = CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials | journal = [[Br Med J]] | volume = 340 | pages = c869 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.c869 | pmid = 20332511 | pmc = 2844943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need in this kind of study is to cancel out the power of suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.winchesterhospital.org/health-library/article?id=21849|title=Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Study {{!}} Winchester Hospital|website=www.winchesterhospital.org|access-date=2018-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Controlled studies ==
Although the double-blind placebo method is the most common, controlled [[placebo]] expierements require a different understanding. A placebo is given to one group of patients, while the treatment being tested is given to another group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.medicinenet.com/hormone_therapy/article.htm#hormone_therapy_facts|title=Hormone Therapy for Women: Side Effects, Cancer Risks|work=MedicineNet|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the control is in the hands of people conducting the expierements. 

== Initial clinical experiments ==
In 1954, at [[Harvard Medical School]] a team led by [[Louis Lasagna]] lead the first known experiment to detect [[placebo]] responders.&lt;ref name=lasagna&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Lasagna L, Mosteller F, Von Felsinger JM, Beecher HK | title = A study of the placebo response | journal = The American Journal of Medicine | volume = 16 | issue = 6 | pages = 770–9 | date = June 1954 | pmid = 13158365 | doi = 10.1016/0002-9343(54)90441-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this experiment approximately 162 postoperative patients were observed for significant pain relief from subcutaneous injections of [[placebo]] and morphine.&lt;ref name="lasagna"/&gt; Differences in response and attitude were exhibited between [[placebo]] respondents and non-placebo respondents.&lt;ref name="lasagna" /&gt; "Using Rorschach tests and qualitative interviews, respondents, compared to non-respondents, were more anxious, self-centered, viewed the hospital care as 'wonderful', had more somatic symptoms, used more cathartics, were 'talkers and were  regular church goers.".&lt;ref name="kaptchuk"/&gt; Overall, this initial study on placebo responders versus non-responders outlined the initial yet undiscovered effects of the placebo within the placebo study.

In 1957, a team led by Wolf at [[Cornell University Medical School]] conducted an experiment to determine the reliability of the placebo response within the placebo study.&lt;ref name=wolf&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wolf S, Doering CR, Clark ML, Hagans JA | title = Chance distribution and placebo reactor | journal = The Journal of Laboratory and Clinical Medicine | volume = 49 | issue = 6 | pages = 837–41 | date = June 1957 | pmid = 13429202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   The conclusion produced the answer to be "the likelihood of predicting placebo responses was not enhanced by increasing the number of placebo tests performed on any individual."&lt;ref name="wolf" /&gt;

A study on double blind [[placebo]] effects from omega 3 fatty acids and their persistant climb was done in 2006. This study concluded that although the results were "too premature to evaluate," they  showed there was a relationship between the efficacy of the antidepressant placebos and the intake of omega threes PUFAs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lin|first=Pao-Yen|last2=Su|first2=Kuan-Pin|date=2007-07-15|title=A Meta-Analytic Review of Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trials of Antidepressant Efficacy of Omega-3 Fatty Acids|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|journal=The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry|volume=68|issue=07|pages=1056–1061|doi=10.4088/jcp.v68n0712|issn=0160-6689}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even your daily diet can trigger aspired results.

__TOC__

==Theoretical foundations==

===Public sphere theory===
Public sphere pedagogy is theoretically grounded in [[Jürgen Habermas]]' conceptualization of the public sphere.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}  In his seminal work ''[[The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere]]'', Habermas envisioned the public sphere as an inclusive discursive space in which the citizens of a society gathered, discussed, and debated over the issues of the day.&lt;ref name="STPS"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262581086 | last = Habermas | first = J. | others = Thomas Burger, Frederick Lawewnce (trans.) | title = The structural transformation of the public sphere: An inquiry into a category of bourgeois society | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1962 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas argued that the European bourgeois public sphere that emerged in eighteenth century coffee houses and salons represented an idealized form of the public sphere. Individuals engaging in discussion in these spaces would share and debate their views with one another. Habermas argues that this dialectic encounter was a critical part of one's social life where individuals, as part of a larger public, could construct [[public opinion]] through critical [[rational discourse]]. Habermas argued that these discussions served to fill the gap between the state and the people by creating what he called a "[[civil society]]". Further, Habermas argued that a functioning public sphere was critical to maintaining a healthy democratic order and [[deliberative democracy]].&lt;ref name="calhoun92"&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262531143 | others = Craig Calhoun (ed.) | title = Habermas and the public sphere | location = Cambridge, MA | year = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional notion of a face-to-face public sphere has evolved with the invention of online technologies. The public sphere no longer requires a physical setting, but can manifest in [[cyberspace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Habermas’ heritage: The future of the public sphere in the network society | last = Boeder | first = Pieter| journal = First Monday| accessdate = 2014-03-17| url = http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1280/1200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coffee house discussions idealized by Habermas have expanded to blogs, discussion forums, and online videos. [[Henry Giroux]] in particular discusses the role of new media in the public sphere and public pedagogy.&lt;ref name="Biesta"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/14649365.2012.723736| issn = 1464-9365| volume = 13| issue = 7| pages = 683–697| last = Biesta| first = Gert| title = Becoming public: public pedagogy, citizenship and the public sphere| journal = Social &amp; Cultural Geography| accessdate = 2014-03-19| date = 2012| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14649365.2012.723736}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, scholars debate whether [[computer-mediated communication]] in an online setting actually constitutes a functioning public sphere or just a public space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/14614440222226244| volume = 4| issue = 1| pages = 9–27| last = Papacharissi| first = Zizi| title = The virtual sphere: The internet as a public sphere| journal = New Media &amp; Society| year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1177/1461444810379862| volume = 13| issue = 5| pages = 739–754| last = Goldberg| first = Greg| title = Rethinking the public/virtual sphere: The problem with participation| journal = New Media &amp; Society| year = 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===The Town Hall Meeting===
Town Hall Meetings are one way public sphere pedagogy has been integrated into curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The CSU, Chico Town Hall Meeting - First-Year Experience - CSU, Chico | work = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2014 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/thm/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; This event began at [[California State University, Chico]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference | conference = 2012 American Democracy Project and The Democracy Commitment National Meeting | last = Weber | first = Lori M. | title = Public Sphere Pedagogy: The Town Hall Meeting and the Chico Great Debate Programs, Assessing the Effect on Students' Civic Dispositions and Success | location = San Antonio, Texas | date = 2012-06-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Classes participating in the Town Hall event require students to research and write about controversial issues. Students then come together with classmates, students from other classes, faculty, and community members. During the Town Hall Meeting, participants move into breakout sessions to share their work and engage in discussions about their topics. Faculty and community members moderate these discussions, share expert insight, and move students toward further development of their work.

===The Great Debate===
The Great Debate also uses public sphere pedagogy as its foundation. This event started at California State University, Chico in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Chico Great Debate - First-Year Experience - CSU, Chico | format = California State University Chico | accessdate = 2014-03-15 | year = 2014 | url = http://www.csuchico.edu/fye/greatdebate/index.shtml }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has since been implemented at [[Butte College]], [[Shasta College]],&lt;ref name="enjoymag" /&gt; and [[Chabot College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Chang| first = Nick| title = Hayward’s ‘Great Debate’ Brings Bilingual Education to Forefront| work = The Pioneer: California State University East Bay| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-12-12| url = http://thepioneeronline.com/19649/news/haywards-great-debate-brings-bilingual-education-to-forefront/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Great Debate requires students from a variety of classes to research and write about a controversial theme. These themes have ranged from water and agriculture&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hacking| first = Heather| title = Students study, share at Chico's City Plaza in day-long Great Debate on ag and water| work = Chico Enterprise Record| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-04-13| url = http://www.chicoer.com/weirdnews/ci_23018351/students-study-share-at-chicos-city-plaza-day}}&lt;/ref&gt; to mental health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Cameron| first = Katerina| title = Great Debate Friday focuses on mental health| work = Chico Enterprise Record| accessdate = 2014-03-15| date = 2013-10-31| url = http://www.chicoer.com/breakingnews/ci_24423914/great-debate-friday-focuses-mental-health}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is open to the public. Students give individual and group presentations, engage in formal debates, break out into discussion sessions, and display interactive poster presentations. Community members and public officials also participate as moderators, discussion leaders, and debaters. Unlike the Town Hall Meetings, which usually take place on campus property, the Great Debate is hosted in public spaces including City Council Chambers and public libraries.

===The Student Voices program===

Student Voices programs are a type of civic engagement initiative that have been implemented in several high schools in the United States. The curriculum has high school students research and complete classroom assignments on current issues in government and candidates in local elections.&lt;ref name="APPC"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Jamieson | first = Kathleen Hall | title = Student Voices | work = The Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2008-05-07 | url = http://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/political-communication/student-voices/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Students then connect with outside communities via the digital public sphere and engage in moderated "Speak Out" events. Student Voices programs have been successfully implemented in curricula in Seattle&lt;ref name="ccca"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Center for Communication &amp; Civic Engagement :: Projects : Student Voices (2001-2006) | work = Center for Communication and Civic Engagement | accessdate = 2014-03-16 | date = 2005-05-17 | url = http://ccce.com.washington.edu/projects/studentVoices.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Pennsylvania&lt;ref name="feldman07"&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1086/520686 | volume = 114 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–100 | last = Feldman | first = Lauren |author2=Josh Pasek |author3=Daniel Romer |author4=Kathleen Hall Jamieson  | title = Identifying Best Practices in Civic Education: Lessons from the Student Voices Program | journal = American Journal of Education | date = 2007-11-01 | jstor = 10.1086/520692 }}&lt;/ref&gt; school districts.

==Critiques==
Public sphere pedagogy inherently is subject to many of the criticisms of Habermas' conception of the public sphere.  Chief among them is the traditionally exclusionary nature. The bourgeois public sphere, as introduced by Habermas, has been characterized as highly patriarchal,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/466240 | issn = 0164-2472 | issue = 25/26 | pages = 56–80 | last = Fraser | first = Nancy | title = Rethinking the public sphere: A contribution to the critique of actually existing democracy | journal = Social Text | date = 1990 | jstor = 466240 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and oblivious to the existence of female&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = The MIT Press | isbn = 0262531143 | pages = 259–288 | editors = Craig Calhoun (ed.) | last = Ryan | first = M. P. | title = Habermas and the public sphere | chapter = Gender and public access: Women's politics in nineteenth century America | location = Cambridge, MA | date = 1992 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and plebeian&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = University of Minnesota Press| isbn = 0816620318| last = Negt| first = Oskar|author2=Alexander Kluge | others = Peter Labanyi, Jamie Owen Daniel, Assebja Oksiloff (trans.)| title = Public sphere and experience: Toward an analysis of the bourgeois and proletarian public sphere| location = Minneapolis, MN| date = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; styles of discourse. The concern here is that as a model of the bourgeois public sphere, applications of public sphere pedagogy might alienate students and community members unaccustomed to this type of dialectic experience.
In addition to its exclusionary nature, attention has also been called  to Habermas' privileging of a hegemonic public sphere. [[Michael Warner]] argues  that the bourgeois public sphere was structured to be affable to those privileged few who made up the powerful upperclass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Zone Books | isbn = 1890951285 | last = Warner | first = Michael | title = Publics and counterpublics | location = New York, NY | date = 2002-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While students participating in public sphere pedagogy application receive special training in their classrooms, the same is not necessarily true of community members who participate. This specialized student training draws two critiques. First, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of instruction risks erasing the plurality that is central to being a public.&lt;ref name="Biesta"/&gt; Training individuals how to be "good" citizens prescribes action in a way that limits the scope of politics and the public sphere. Second, conceiving of public pedagogy as a form of learning risks eclipsing politics with education.&lt;ref name="Biesta"/&gt; Turning political and social issues into learning problems individualizes the issues instead of making them the responsibility of the public.

'''Resources for the Future''' ('''RFF''') is an American [[nonprofit organization]] that conducts independent research into environmental, energy, and natural resource issues, primarily via economics and other social sciences. Headquartered in [[Washington, D.C.]], RFF performs research around the world. Founded in 1952, the institution is widely recognized as a pioneer in the field of resource economics.{{by whom|date=March 2018}}

== Overview and history ==
In 1951, U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] asked [[William S. Paley]], the chairman of the board of Columbia Broadcasting System ([[CBS]]), to form a Materials Policy Commission to study the country's natural resource needs. The report, ''Resources for Freedom: Foundations for Growth and Security'', recommended the formation of an independent organization to analyze the supply of the country’s natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;Darmstadter, Joel. [http://www.rff.org/rff/News/Features/loader.cfm?url=/commonspot/security/getfile.cfm&amp;PageID=11135 Hans H. Landsberg and Sam H. Schurr: Reflections and Appreciation] ''The Energy Journal'' Vol 24, No 4. October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Founded in 1952 with initial grants from the [[Ford Foundation]], RFF focused in its early years on natural resource scarcity and import dependence, helping to pioneer the field of resource economics. It became the first "think tank" devoted exclusively to natural resource and environmental issues. 

As of 2011, RFF’s staff encompasses some 75 researchers and staff. Most researchers hold doctorates in economics, but many also hold advanced degrees in engineering, law, ecology, city and regional planning, U.S. government, and public policy and management, among other fields.

In addition, specialized centers, programs, and initiatives at RFF focus on specific areas of research and operate collaboratively across disciplines. These include the [http://www.rff.org/ccep Center for Climate and Electricity Policy]; the [http://www.rff.org/cmew Center for the Management of Ecological Wealth]; the [http://www.rff.org/ceep Center for Energy Economics and Policy]; the [http://www.rff.org/cfep Center for Forest Economics and Policy]; and the [http://www.rff.org/efd Environment for Development]. RFF also established and is closely affiliated with the [http://www.cddep.org Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy], which is now an independent unit.

Although RFF scholars are free to express professional opinions in their research, the organization itself does not take institutional positions on legislation or regulatory policy. RFF characterizes itself as nonpartisan, objective, and independent, "acting as a neutral broker of sound information and data."&lt;ref&gt; Sharp, in McGann, James. ''Think Tanks and Policy Advice in the United States: Academics, Advisors and Advocates''. Routledge, 2007. {{ISBN|978-0-415-77228-0}}. p135.&lt;/ref&gt; 

RFF publishes [http://www.rff.org/Publications/Resources/Pages/default.aspx ''Resources''] magazine, as well as discussion papers, issue briefs, and peer-reviewed reports. Its book publishing operation, RFF Press, an imprint of Routledge, publishes book-length works by RFF staff and outside researchers, academics, and journalists.

In June 2010, RFF was awarded the FEEM 20th Anniversary Prize in Environmental Economics by the European-based [http://www.feem.it Fondazione Eni Enrico Mattei]. The award recognized RFF as a “key driver of market-based environmental policy.”

== Funding ==
RFF is a 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization. In fiscal year 2010, RFF's operating revenue was $11.04 million, most of which came from individual and corporate contributions, foundation and government grants, and investment income.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.rff.org/About_RFF/Documents/RFF%202010%20AR%20Final.pdf RFF 2010 Annual Report] &lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]], the George Kaiser Family Foundation, the [[Robert Wood Johnson Foundation]], the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] comprised RFF’s top five donors in 2009.&lt;ref&gt; ''[http://www.greenleaf-publishing.com/content/pdfs/bgtpint.pdf Business Guide to Partnering with NGOs and the United Nations 2007/2008: A report by the UN Global Compact] and [[Dalberg Global Development Advisors]].''] p502-505.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's research programs make up the bulk of its expenses, amounting to 76.8 percent in 2010.

== Notable RFF research ==
Several influential scholars from RFF's early years helped shape environmental policies worldwide.

* [[John Krutilla]] was a central figure at RFF from 1955 to 1988. In his 1967 paper "Conservation Reconsidered," Krutilla described the economic value of undisturbed natural environments like rivers and forests.

* [[Allen Kneese]] joined RFF in 1961, and his work on water quality management led him to argue that market-based incentives like pollution taxes, which left it up to each polluter to find the cheapest and easiest way to comply, were more efficient than conventional regulation at reducing pollution and costs to the economy, and avoided distortions in international trade.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. d'Arge, Ralph C., and Allen V.

*[[Marion Clawson]], a long-time RFF scholar and a former acting president of the institution, was a pioneer in the field of resource economics who had a major influence on government policies over public lands and forest management. His 1975 book ''Forests for Whom and for What?'' examined ways to balance timber production, recreation, and ecology in the use of federal forest land. He was an early advocate of sustainability in management of natural environments and preservation of wilderness areas

RFF also conducted pathbreaking research on the allocation of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. [http://www.harveyjlevin.com Harvey J.

== Leadership ==
Richard Newell joined RFF as president on September 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rff.org/blog/2016/richard-g-newell-named-next-president-rff|title=Richard G. Newell Named Next President of RFF {{!}} Resources for the Future|website=www.rff.org|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was previously the Gendell Professor of Energy and Environmental Economics at Duke University and Founding Director of its Energy Initiative and Energy Data Analytics Lab.  From 2009 to 2011, he served as the administrator of the US Energy Information Administration, the agency responsible for official US government energy statistics and analysis. He also served as the senior economist for energy and environment on the President's Council of Economic Advisers and was a senior fellow, and later a board member, at RFF.

[http://www.rff.org/Researchers/Pages/PhilSharp.aspx Philip R. Sharp] served as president from 2005 to 2016. Before joining RFF, Sharp served 10 terms as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from Indiana (1975 to 1995). He then joined the faculty of the John F. Kennedy School of Government and the Institute of Politics at [[Harvard University]]. As of 2010, Sharp is co-chair of the Energy Board of the Keystone Center and serves on the Board of Directors of the [[Duke Energy]] Corporation and the Energy Foundation. He is also a member of the Cummins Science and Technology Advisory Council and serves on the Advisory Board of the [[Institute of Nuclear Power Operations]] and on the External Advisory Board of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Energy Initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rff.org/Phil-Sharp.cfm Phil Sharp] Resources for the Future.&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of the [https://www.energy.gov/news/8584.htm Blue Ribbon Commission on America's Nuclear Future] and the [http://www.uspref.org U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance].

Paul R. Portney served as president of RFF from 1995 to 2005. Portney joined the research staff of RFF in 1972. From 1986 to 1989 he headed two of its research divisions, and in 1989 he became its vice president. In June 2005, Portney became dean of the Eller College of Management at the [[University of Arizona]]. One journalist assessed Portney's tenure at RFF by saying that "he never shied away from using the facts to challenge business interests that reflexively opposed all regulation, or environmental groups that never met one they didn’t like."

== Recent and current projects ==
In July 2011, RFF’s [http://www.rff.org/ceep Center for Energy Economics and Policy (CEEP)] launched an [http://www.rff.org/centers/energy_economics_and_policy/Pages/Shale_Gas.aspx initiative] to identify the priority risks associated with the [[hydraulic fracturing]] of shale formations and recommend strategies for responsible development. This analysis, made possible by a $1.2 million grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, will be the first independent, broad assessment of the key risks associated with the shale gas development process.

The CEEP research team, led by RFF Research Director and Senior Fellow [http://www.rff.org/Researchers/Pages/ResearchersBio.aspx?ResearcherID=39 Alan Krupnick], will survey expert opinion and public perception to deter¬mine the most significant risks and the behaviors of industry and regulators that influence those risks. Pairing these findings to an analysis of existing state and federal policies will lead to recommendations for how to improve the management of shale gas development. 

In August 2010, the National Commission on the BP [[Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill]] and Offshore Drilling asked CEEP to conduct a series of studies that would help inform the commission’s report and recommendations. Nearly a dozen RFF experts in risk assessment, regulatory and benefit–cost analysis, government enforcement, and the [[oil industry]] formulated a [http://www.rff.org/centers/energy_economics_and_policy/Pages/Deepwater_Drilling.aspx series of findings and recommendations] to improve the safety of future oil drilling operations.

In [http://www.rff.org/News/Features/Pages/RFF-Responds-to-Senate-CES-Request.aspx response to questions] on a clean energy standard (CES) posed by leadership of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in April 2011, experts from RFF submitted key findings from their research and modeling.

Several RFF researchers contributed to the work of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC), the co-recipient of the 2007 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. Among current and former RFF researchers who have participated in the nearly two decades since the IPCC was founded are Senior Fellows [http://www.rff.org/Researchers/Pages/ResearchersBio.aspx?ResearcherID=39 Alan Krupnick], [http://www.rff.org/Researchers/Pages/ResearchersBio.aspx?ResearcherID=60 Roger Sedjo], William Pizer, and [http://www.rff.org/Researchers/Pages/ResearchersBio.aspx?ResearcherID=47 Richard Morgenstern]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rff.org/rff/News/Releases/2007Releases/Oct2007NobelPeacePrize.cfm RFF Researchers Share in 2007 Nobel Peace Prize]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an RFF study ''[http://www.rff.org/RFF/Documents/RFF-RPT-ORRG-State-of-Outdoors.pdf The State of the Great Outdoors: America's Parks, Public Lands, and Recreation Resources]'', authored by Margaret Walls, Sarah Darley, and Juha Siikamäki, examined the condition of America’s outdoor resources, the demand for recreation, and the financing of conservation, parks, and open space. It was carried out in conjunction with the Outdoor Resources Review Group, a bipartisan assemblage of public officials, conservation specialists, and recreation professionals.

In 2010, RFF and the [http://nepinstitute.org National Energy Policy Institute] released a comprehensive economic analysis of more than 35 available policy options for reducing U.S. oil consumption and curbing carbon dioxide emissions through 2030. Combining a standardized modeling approach and the judgments of top academic experts from around the country, ''[http://www.rff.org/toward-a-new-energy-policy Toward a New National Energy Policy: Assessing the Options]'' provides a rigorous “apples-to apples” comparison of how different policies rank in terms of such quantitative measures as costs and ability to reduce CO2 emissions and barrels of oil consumed.

{{Anthropology of religion|Basic|image=[[File:Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi.jpg|center|280px]]|caption=Initiation ritual of boys in Malawi. The ritual marks the passage from child to adult male, each subgroup having its customs and expectations.}}

A '''rite of passage''' is a ceremony of the passage which occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another. It involves a significant change of [[social status|status in society]]. In [[cultural anthropology]] the term is the Anglicisation of ''rite de passage'', a French term innovated by the [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Arnold van Gennep]] in his work ''Les rites de passage'', "The Rites of Passage".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|1909|loc=Lay Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term is now fully adopted into anthropology as well as into the literature and popular cultures of many modern languages.

== Original conception ==
In English, Van Gennep's first sentence of his first chapter begins:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=I. The Classification of Rites}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Each larger society contains within it several distinctly separate groupings. ... In addition, all these groups break down into still smaller societies in subgroups."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The population of a society belongs to multiple groups, some more important to the individual than others. Van Gennep uses the metaphor, "as a kind of house divided into rooms and corridors."&lt;ref name=Journet&gt;{{cite journal | first=Nicolas | last=Journet | title=Les rites de passage | journal=Sciences Humaines | date=1 January 2001 | number=112 | url=http://www.scienceshumaines.com/les-rites-de-passage_fr_1079.html | quote=chaque société générale peut être considérée comme une sorte de maison divisée en chambres et couloirs}}&lt;/ref&gt; A passage occurs when an individual leaves one group to enter another; in the metaphor, he changes rooms.

Van Gennep further distinguishes between "the secular" and "the sacred sphere." Theorizing that civilizations are arranged on a scale, implying that the lower levels represent "the simplest level of development," he hypothesizes that "[[social groups]] in such a society likewise have magico-religious foundations." Many groups in modern industrial society practice customs that can be traced to an earlier sacred phase.  Passage between these groups requires a [[ceremony]], or ritual hence rite of passage.

The rest of Van Gennep's book presents a description of rites of passage and an organization into types, although in the end he despairs of ever capturing them all:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Van Gennep|Vizedom|Caffee|2010|loc=X. Conclusions}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is but a rough sketch of an immense picture ...." He is able to find some universals, mainly two: "the sexual separation between men and women, and the magico-religious separation between the profane and the sacred." (Earlier the translators used secular for profane.) He refuses credit for being the first to recognize type of rites. In the work he concentrates on groups and rites individuals might normally encounter progressively: pregnancy, childbirth, initiation, betrothal, marriage, funerals and the like. He mentions some others, such as the territorial passage, a crossing of borders into a culturally different region, such as one where a different religion prevails.

==Stages==
Rites of passage have three phases: separation, liminality, and incorporation, as van Gennep described. "I propose to call the rites of separation from a previous world, ''preliminal rites'', those executed during the transitional stage ''liminal (or threshold) rites'', and the ceremonies of incorporation into the new world ''postliminal rites''."&lt;ref&gt;van Gennep 1977: 21&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first phase, people withdraw from their current status and prepare to move from one place or status to another. "The first phase (of separation) comprises symbolic behavior signifying the detachment of the individual or group ... from an earlier fixed point in the social structure."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 80.&lt;/ref&gt; There is often a detachment or "cutting away" from the former self in this phase, which is signified in symbolic actions and rituals. For example, the cutting of the hair for a person who has just joined the army. He or she is "cutting away" the former self: the civilian.

The transition (liminal) phase is the period between states, during which one has left one place or state but has not yet entered or joined the next. "The attributes of [[liminality]] or of liminal ''personae'' ("threshold people") are necessarily ambiguous."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 95&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third phase (reaggregation or incorporation) the passage is consummated [by] the ritual subject."&lt;ref&gt;Turner 1969: 80&lt;/ref&gt; Having completed the rite and assumed their "new" identity, one re-enters society with one's new status. Re-incorporation is characterized by elaborate rituals and ceremonies, like debutant balls and college graduation, and by outward symbols of new ties: thus "in rites of incorporation there is widespread use of the 'sacred bond', the 'sacred cord', the knot, and of analogous forms such as the belt, the ring, the bracelet and the crown."&lt;ref&gt;van Gennep 1977: 166&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological effects==

Laboratory experiments have shown that severe initiations produce [[cognitive dissonance]].&lt;ref&gt;Aronson &amp; Mills 1959.&lt;/ref&gt; It is theorized that such dissonance heightens [[Interpersonal attraction|group attraction]] among initiates after the experience, arising from internal justification of the effort used.&lt;ref&gt;Festinger 1961.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reward system|Rewards]] during initiations have important consequences in that initiates who feel more rewarded express stronger group identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kamau 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As well as group attraction, initiations can also produce [[conformity]] among new members.&lt;ref&gt;Keating ''et al.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychology experiments have also shown that initiations increase feelings of [[Need for affiliation|affiliation]].&lt;ref&gt;Lodewijkx ''et al.'' 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural==
[[File:Hamer bull jumping (6) (29167685366).jpg|thumb|The [[Hamar people|Hamar]] are known for their custom of "bull jumping," which initiates a boy into manhood.]]
Initiation rites are seen as fundamental to human growth and development as well as socialization in many African communities. These rites function by ritually marking the transition of someone to full group membership.&lt;ref name="Shahadah"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.africanholocaust.net/africanculture.html | title= African Culture Complex | accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also links individuals to the community and the community to the broader and more potent spiritual world.  Initiation rites are "a natural and necessary part of a community, just as arms and legs are natural and necessary extension of the human body".  These rites are linked to individual and community development. Dr. Manu Ampim identifies five stages; rite to birth, rite to adulthood, rite to marriage, rite to eldership and rite to ancestorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manuampim.com/AfricanInitiationRites.htm The Five Major African Initiation Rites] Prof. Manu Ampim&lt;/ref&gt; In Zulu culture entering womanhood is celebrated by the [[Umhlanga (ceremony)|Umhlanga]].

==Types and examples==
Rites of passage are diverse, and are found throughout many cultures around the world. Many western societal rituals may look like rites of passage but miss some of the important structural and functional components. However, in many Native and African-American communities, traditional rites of passage programs are conducted by community-based organizations such as ''Man Up Global''. Typically the missing piece is the societal recognition and reincorporation phase. [[Adventure education]] programs, such as [[Outward Bound]], have often been described as potential rites of passage. Pamela Cushing researched the rites of passage impact upon adolescent youth at the Canadian Outward Bound School and found the rite of passage impact was lessened by the missing reincorporation phase.&lt;ref&gt;Cushing 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Bell (2003) presented more evidence of this lacking third stage and described the "Contemporary Adventure Model of a Rites of Passage" as a modern and weaker version of the rites of passage typically used by outdoor adventure programs.

[[Image:Roso schola copia.jpg|thumb|280px|Inauguration of the “House of the Philosopher” of the Schola Philosophicae Initiationis. On first plane there appear Mario Roso de Luna and Eduardo Alfonso.]]

The '''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis''' (School of Philosophical Initiation) was a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] [[splinter group]] created in [[Madrid]] in 1928 by Eduardo Alfonso and [[Mario Roso de Luna]] in response to what they considered the doctrinal deviations of the [[Theosophical Society]], especially in reference to the proclamation of [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]] as the [[Theosophical Society#"The "World Teacher"|World Teacher]].

==Foundation==

In mid-1921, Mario Roso de Luna, with a dozen companions from Madrid, formed the ''Rama Hesperia,'' which kept close ties with the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] in [[India]] as well as with the dissident [[Theosophical Society Pasadena]] in [[California]]. Around 1928,  Roso de Luna and his group founded the [[Initiation (Theosophy)|initiatic]] philosophical school ''Schola Philosophicae Initiationis'' (SPI) that was "a reaction against the instability and indiscipline of the Theosophical Society."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: El porvenir de la Teosofía comprometido por la Sociedad Teosófica&lt;/ref&gt; The declared objectives of the SPI were "the comparative study of the philosophies, sciences and arts in their mutual relations, and promoting the health and culture of its members as well as their moral progress".&lt;ref&gt;Alfonso, Eduardo: La Casa del Filósofo&lt;/ref&gt;

The new School bought a property in [[Manzanares el Real]] in the [[Community of Madrid]] to build a center for advanced philosophical studies called ''The House of the Philosopher''. The School was based on three stages of knowledge "as corresponds to any initiatic society and consequently to the three objects of the Theosophical Society, that deep inside are nothing but the three initiatic grades of all corresponding institutions which, having been misunderstood and disrespected, have led the T.S. to disunity and mental anarchy".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

The disciples of the SPI followed a gradual and methodical program of studies covering the three stages: the first, studies on [[Hygiene]] and [[Morality|Morals]]; the second on [[Science]] and [[Nature]]; and the third on [[Psychology]] and [[Philosophy]].

==Decline and dissolution==

Mario Roso de Luna died in 1931, after which Dr. Eduardo Alfonso became the head of the School, continuing the instruction of disciples. However, after 1936, the [[Spanish Civil War]] caused the suspension of many of the philosophical and cultural activities in Madrid. At the end of the Civil War, Eduardo Alfonso was tried according to the “Law for the Repression of Masonry and Communism” and sentenced to several years of imprisonment which he served in a Burgos prison from 1942 to 1948. After serving his time, Alfonso was exiled to Latin America until 1966 when he returned to his Country.

A '''segue''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-segue.ogg|ˈ|s|ɛ|ɡ|w|eɪ}} ({{IPA-it|ˈseːɡwe}}) is a smooth transition from one topic or section to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{ShorterOxfordEnglishDictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is derived from [[Italian language|Italian]] ''segue'', "follows".

==In music==
{{refimprove|section|date=July 2017}}
In [[music]], ''segue'' is a direction to the performer. It means ''continue (the next section) without a pause''. The term [[attacca]] is used synonymously.

For written music it implies a transition from one [[section (music)|section]] to the next without any break. In [[Musical improvisation|improvisation]], it is often used for transitions created as a part of the performance, leading from one section to another.

In live performance, a segue can occur during a [[jam session]], where the improvisation of the end of one song progresses into a new song. Segues can even occur between groups of musicians during live performance. For example, as one band finishes its set, members of the following act replace members of the first band one by one, until a complete band swap occurs.

In recorded music, a segue is a seamless transition between one song and another. The effect is often achieved through [[beatmatching]], especially on [[dance (music)|dance]] and [[disco]] recordings, or through arrangements that create the effect of a musical [[suite (music)|suite]], a classical style also used in many [[progressive rock]] recordings. The songs may further contain a lyrical connection or overall theme as well. With breakless joins of the elements in his albums [[Frank Zappa]] made extensive use of the segue technique.&lt;ref name="zappa"&gt;{{cite book |title=Frank Zappa FAQ: All That's Left to Know About the Father of Invention |first1=John |last1=Corcelli |publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation |year=2016 |isbn=978-1-61713-673-3 |page=290 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=8e7aDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT209 Extract of page 290]&lt;/ref&gt; This was first used in 1966 on Zappa's ''[[Freak Out!]]'', and a year later on the [[Beatles]]' ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.&lt;ref name="zappa" /&gt;

In some Brazilian musical styles, where it is called "emendar" ("to splice"), in particular in [[Samba]] and [[Forró]] Pé de Serra, it is very commonly used in live performances, creating sets that usually last around 20 minutes but can sometimes take more than an hour, switching seamlessly between different songs.   The larger rhythm groups of bands, with up to ten percussionists in Samba for example, facilitate the switching of one song to another, as the percussionists keep the rhythm or beat going while the pitch instruments prepare the harmonical transition to the next song, often with just one pitch instrument leading this transition.   In [[Forró]] trios, where the only pitch instrument (apart from the voice) is the accordion (which plays together with two percussionists), the accordionist usually "puxa" ("pulls") the next song as soon as the previous has finished.

Some album notations distinguish track listings through the use of symbols, such as a &gt;, →, or / to indicate songs that flow seamlessly. The alternative rock band [[Failure (band)|Failure]] separates these musical transitions into individual tracks, which are simply given numerical distinctions such as ''Segue 1''. This system began with their 1996 album ''[[Fantastic Planet (album)|Fantastic Planet]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.readjunk.com/reviews/albumreviews/failure-in-the-future/&lt;/ref&gt;

==In film or broadcast news production==

In audio/visual media, a segue is smooth transition from one scene or topic to another. A segue allows the director or show host to naturally proceed from one scene or topic to another without jarring the audience. A good segue makes the transition look natural and effortless.

The term '''social criticism''' often refers to a mode of criticism that locates the reasons for malicious conditions in a society considered to be in a flawed [[social structure]]. It may also refer to people adhering to a social critic's aims at practical solutions by way of specific measures either for consensual [[reform]] or powerful [[revolution]].

== European roots ==
[[Religious persecution]] was common in Europe and was the reason for many physical and mental exoduses within the continent. Through such experiences, one of the first documents of social criticism was born: the [[Jean Meslier#Social Criticism|''Testament'' of Jean Meslier]].

== Protest experience with political theories==
Repression experienced by a [[minority group|minority]] often leads to [[protest]].{{citation needed|date=October 2018}} Without sufficient resolution of the dispute, a social criticism can be formulated, often covered by political groups (political [[monopoly]]). For protesting people ''within'' a [[social movement]], it is often frustrating to [[experience]] failure of the movement and its own agenda.{{citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The [[positivism dispute]] between [[critical rationalism]], e.g. between [[Karl Popper]] and  the [[Frankfurt School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=D'Amico|first=Robert|date=1990-12-21|title=Karl Popper and the Frankfurt School|url=http://journal.telospress.com/content/1990/86/33|journal=Telos|language=en|volume=1990|issue=86|pages=33–48|doi=10.3817/1290086033|issn=0090-6514}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the academic form of the same discrepancy. This dispute deals with the question of whether research in the [[social sciences]] should be "neutral" or consciously adopt a partisan view.

==Academic forms==
Academic works of social criticism can belong to  [[social philosophy]], [[political economy]], [[sociology]], [[social psychology]], [[psychoanalysis]] but also [[cultural studies]] and other disciplines or reject academic forms of [[discourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hhh.gavilan.edu/kwarren/LitCrit.html|title=Types of Literary Criticism|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature and music==
{{see also|Literary criticism}}
Social criticism can also be expressed in a fictional form, e.g. in a revolutionary novel like ''[[The Iron Heel]]'' by [[Jack London]] or in [[dystopia]]n [[novel]]s like  [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' (1932) or [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' (1949) or [[Ray Bradbury]]'s ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' (1953), or [[Rafael Grugman]]'s ''[[Nontraditional Love]]'' (2008), [[children's books]] or films.

Fictional literature can have a significant social impact. For example, the 1852 novel ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'', by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] furthered the [[abolitionism in the United States|anti-slavery movement]] in the United States, and the 1885 novel ''[[Ramona]]'', by [[Helen Hunt Jackson]], brought about changes in laws regarding [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]]. Similarly, [[Upton Sinclair]]'s 1906 novel ''[[The Jungle]]'' helped create new laws related to public health and food handling, and [[Arthur Morrison]]'s 1896 novel ''A Child of the Jago'' caused England to change its housing laws. George Orwell and [[Charles Dickens]] wrote ''[[Animal Farm]]'' and ''[[A Tale of Two Cities]]'', respectively, to express their disillusionment with society and human nature. ''Animal Farm'', written in 1944, is a book that tells the animal fable of a farm in  which the farm animals revolt against their human masters. It is an  example of social criticism in literature in which Orwell satirized  the events in Russia after the [[Bolshevik Revolution]]. He anthropomorphises the animals, and alludes each one to a counterpart  in [[Russian history]]. ''A Tale of Two Cities'' also typifies this kind of literature. Besides the central theme of love, is another prevalent theme, that of a revolution gone bad. He shows us that, unfortunately, human nature causes us to be vengeful and, for some of us, overly ambitious. Both these books are similar in that both describe how, even with the best of intentions, our ambitions get the best of us. Both authors also demonstrate that violence and the [[Machiavellian]] attitude of "the ends justifying the means" are deplorable. They also express their authors' disenchantment with the state of evolution of human nature.

According to [[Frederick Douglass]], "Where justice is denied, where poverty is enforced, where ignorance prevails, and where any one class is made to feel that society is an organized conspiracy to oppress, rob and degrade them, neither persons nor property will be safe."&lt;ref&gt;From Douglass´ speech in 1886 on the 24th anniversary of Emancipation, Washington, D.C.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors imply, that even if we begin with honourable intentions, there will be some who will let their basic instincts take control. ''Animal Farm'' portrays this nature through parodying events in real history. Given the right conditions, these events could happen anywhere. Take for example, a leader becoming overly ambitious, to the point of harming his people for more power.

In ''A Tale of Two Cities'', Dickens examines the inner soul, and shares with us how people are driven to the valley of human emotions, where desperation and anger reign, and what could happen afterwards if we let these emotions build up inside. Every human being is capable of becoming a ruthless, opportunistic being like Napoleon or Madame Defarge, if placed in the right place, at the right time.

Social criticism is certainly present in opera ([[The Cradle Will Rock]], [[Trouble in Tahiti]]) and other types of classical music, such as the [[Symphony No. 13 (Shostakovich)|Symphony No.13]], called "[[Babi Yar]]", of [[Dmitri Shostakovich]]. Other musical expressions of social criticism are  frequent in [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[rap]] music, examples being [[Pretty Vacant|"Pretty Vacant"]] by [[Sex Pistols]] and [[Brenda's Got a Baby|"Brenda's Got a Baby"]] by [[2Pac]]. Heavy metal bands such as [[Black Sabbath]], [[Metallica]] and [[Megadeth]] also use social criticism extensively, particularly in their earlier works.

'''Sophus Thalbitzer''' (1871–1941) was a Danish psychiatrist and medical doctor specializing in [[manic depressive psychosis|manic depressive psychoses]]. He successfully influenced [[LGBT history in Denmark|Danish legislation on homosexuality]] towards decriminalization in 1933.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-25927595 |title=Where is it illegal to be gay? |accessdate=23 February 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Thalbitzer never married in his life, there are no sources to support the hypotheses that he was [[homosexuality|homosexual]] or [[bisexuality|bisexual]].

==Life==
In 1912 Thalbitzer became consultant at the [[St Hans Women's Hospital]] near [[Copenhagen]].
In 1923 Thalbitzer became a member of the Advisory Board of Directors of the [[Scientific-Humanitarian Committee]]. In 1924 and 1925 he published two articles on [[homosexuality]], successfully influencing Danish criminal legislation with his 'scientific' defence of the lowering of homosexual age of consent from 21 to 18.&lt;ref name="AldrichWotherspoon2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wilhelm von Rosen|editor=Robert Aldrich; Garry Wotherspoon|title=Who's who in Gay and Lesbian History: From Antiquity to World War II|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLWTqBmifh0C&amp;pg=PA518|year=2002|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-15983-8|pages=518–9|chapter=Thalbitzer, Sophus}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stendhal syndrome''', '''Stendhal's syndrome''', '''hyperkulturemia''', or '''Florence syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0317| title = Stendhal syndrome: A case of cultural overload| journal = Case Reports| volume = 2009| pages = bcr0620080317| year = 2009| last1 = Nicholson | first1 = T.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stendhal syndrome was named after Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), better known by his penname [[Stendhal]].]]
The illness is named after the 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book ''Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio''.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] are buried, he was overcome with emotion. He wrote:{{quote|I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty ... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations ... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call 'nerves'. Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;pg=PA196 | title=Interfaces of Performance | editor-first1=Maria |editor-last1= Chatzichristodoulou | editor-first2=Janis |editor-last2= Jefferies |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last3= Zerihan | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2009 |page= 196 |isbn= 9781409486145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He had been shown the frescoes in the church including those by [[Giotto]], and modern writers frequently attribute his emotions mistakenly to the latter rather than powerful historical associations of the tombs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the aforementioned [[Uffizi]] in Florence, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence. There is no scientific evidence to define the Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Innocenti |first1=Claudia |last2=Fioravanti |first2=Giulia |last3=Spiti |first3=Raffaello |last4=Faravelli |first4=Carlo |title=La sindrome di Stendhal fra psicoanalisi e neuroscienze |journal=Rivista di Psichiatria |date=1 March 2014 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=61–66  |doi=10.1708/1461.16139|pmid=24770571 |issn=2038-2502  |trans-title=[The Stendhal syndrome between psychoanalysis and neuroscience]. |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1816">'''"Sudbury Saturday Night"''' is one of the most famous songs by [[Stompin' Tom Connors]], which depicts the hard-drinking, hard-partying social life of [[Underground mining (hard rock)|hard rock miners]] in the [[Northern Ontario]] mining city of [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Gillian|title=The North American Folk Music Revival: Nation and Identity in the United States and Canada, 1945-1980|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2007|page=158|isbn=978-0-7546-5756-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XtVapc9Nt8kC&amp;pg=PA158}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The song's chorus is:
: ''Yeah, the girls are out to [[Bingo (U.S.)|bingo]]
: ''And the boys are gettin' [[drunkenness|stinko]]
: ''And we'll think no more of [[CVRD Inco|Inco]]
: ''On a Sudbury Saturday night''

Originally released on Connors' 1967 debut album ''The Northlands' Own Tom Connors'', the song also reappeared on his 1972 album ''Bud the Spud'', his live album ''Live at the Horseshoe'', the compilations ''A Proud Canadian'' and ''25 of the Best Stompin' Tom Souvenirs'', and the 1995 rerelease of ''The Northlands' Own Tom Connors'' under the title ''Northlands Zone''.

"Sudbury Saturday Night" was covered by Canadian musician [[Kim Mitchell]] in 1998 on the compilation ''[[Summer Dock Party]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=LeBlanc|first=Larry|date=1998-07-11|title=New Discs Feature Vintage Pop|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|volume=110|issue=28|pages=48|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-AkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=2010-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sustainable markets''' can be loosely defined as those that contribute to stronger livelihoods and more [[sustainable]] environments. In linking with the pursuit of ‘[[sustainable development]]’, such markets have a multiple focus on social, environmental and economic outcomes. Sustainable markets aim to reflect the true costs (or [[externalities]]) of [[natural resource]] [[Environmental degradation|degradation]], [[environmental pollution]], and promote just and [[Occupational safety and health|safe labour]] practices.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key tools ==

In transitioning to sustainable markets, formal rules sometimes called [[market governance mechanism]]s (MGMS)are key potential tools to shape and govern markets. Examples could include Fairtrade certification, sustainable reporting and metrics, payments for [[ecosystem services]] or other market-based instruments. MGMs change the behaviour of consumers, investors or producers so that their decisions result in more sustainable outcomes.&lt;ref&gt;IIED Sustainable Markets Group (2011) ‘Research prospectus – Shaping Sustainable Markets’ http://shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/sites/shapingsustainablemarkets.iied.org/files/20110520%20Research%20prospectus.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; MGMs could provide economic signals or incentives, for example in pricing externalities. Regulatory mechanisms could prohibit or require certain practices by consumers or producers. Or cooperative mechanisms could create voluntary or more formal partnerships around environmental norms or standards.

== Debates ==

There are a number of contentious issues and ongoing debates around sustainable markets, particularly in how to achieve sustainable markets. There are questions around the appropriate mix of policy instruments or mechanisms, and for which context. For example, a developing world country may require specific mechanisms to build sustainable markets, particularly where more informal or fledgling economies exist. These also involve wider debates over how economic globalisation and trade can benefit countries where local capacities or institutions are weak.

Furthermore, there are unresolved debates over how much regulation or [[economic interventionism|government intervention]] is appropriate in order to govern sustainable markets. For example, in pricing pollution like [[greenhouse gases]] (GHGs), there are competing arguments over whether there should be government-mandated taxes to limit pollution by economic disincentives or whether a market should determine the price to pollute. In many cases a mixture of both may be favourable.

Broader questions remain over whether sustainable markets can ever fully account for environmental externalities, such as those associated with pollution. This relates to whether an economic model focused on [[GDP]] rather than wellbeing can truly bring about the transformation outlined in sustainable development. There have been suggestions that a move away from a pure focus on GDP is required, towards an emphasis represented in methods such as [[natural capital]] accounting.

== Organizations ==

A number of organizations are working in the sustainable markets field.

* The [[International Institute for Environment and Development]]’s Sustainable Markets Group develops research and analysis towards sustainable markets and the debates and innovations shaping markets.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Environment and Development (2015) http://www.iied.org/group/sustainable-markets&lt;/ref&gt; This research also includes a database of market governance mechanisms. 
* The U.S based [[Skoll Foundation]] runs a programme on sustainable markets which focuses on areas such as responsible supply chains, access to finance for sustainable small and medium enterprises including clean energy companies and work on environmental standards and certification.&lt;ref&gt;Skoll Foundation (2015) ‘Sustainable Markets page’ http://www.skollfoundation.org/issue/sustainable-markets/&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The [[International Institute for Sustainable Development]] runs the Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade initiative.&lt;ref&gt;International Institute for Sustainable Development (2013) ‘Sustainable Markets and Responsible Trade’ https://www.iisd.org/markets/&lt;/ref&gt; This focuses on the sustainability of international trade and the design and implementation of supply chains. 
* The Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets, based at [[Stockholm School of Economics]], aims to provide policy research and advice to Swedish and international actors. Misum is a cross-disciplinary and multi-stakeholder knowledge center dedicated to sustainability and sustainable markets and contains three research platforms: Sustainability in Financial Markets (Mistra Financial Systems), Sustainability in Production and Consumption and Sustainable Socio-Economic Development.&lt;ref&gt;Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (2015) http://www.hhs.se/misum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mistra.org/forskning/pagaende-forskning/misum---mistra-center-for-sustainable-markets.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Durham Proverbs''''' is a collection of 46 mediaeval proverbs from various sources.  They were written down as a collection, in the eleventh century, on some pages (pages 43 [[recto and verso|verso]] to 45 verso, between a [[hymnal]] and a collection of [[canticle]]s) of a manuscript that were originally left blank.  The manuscript is currently in the collection of [[Durham Cathedral]], to which it was donated in the eighteenth century.  The ''Proverbs'' form the first part of the manuscript.  The second part, to which it is bound, is a copy of [[Ælfric]]'s ''Grammar'' (minus its glossary).{{sfn|Milfull|1996|pp=34}}{{sfn|Hollis|Wright|1992|pp=34}}{{sfn|Springer|1995|pp=129}}  Each proverb is written in both [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[Old English language|Old English]], with the former preceding the latter.{{sfn|Hollis|Wright|1992|pp=35}}  Olof Arngart's opinion is that the Proverbs were originally in Old English and translated to Latin, but this has since been disputed in a conference paper by [[T. A. Shippey]] {{harv|Shippey|1989}}.{{sfn|Milfull|1996|pp=34}}

==Origin==
While Richard Marsden's introduction in ''The Cambridge Old English Reader'' discusses the essentials of the Durham Proverbs, there is still more to be learned.{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302&amp;ndash;303}} The Durham Proverbs are held in a manuscript that is kept in the library of Durham Cathedral, which is why they are named the "Durham" Proverbs.{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302}}  The original home of the manuscript is thought most likely to have been in [[Canterbury]].{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=288}} The original manuscript of the Durham Proverbs contains copies of [[Ælfric]]'s own work.{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=288}}{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302}}  Several of the proverbs also appear in later works of the thirteenth-century. Considering the repetition of their use, during later times and in future works, stresses their importance from the eleventh-century society. For every one of the Durham Proverbs, there is a Latin version. The commonalities between the Latin version of the proverbs and the Old English version, in more than one manuscript, suggest that there was a common source from which the Durham Proverbs were created in Old English from Latin.{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=289&amp;ndash;290}}

==Background and history==
The Durham Proverbs are considered to have been used to document everyday business of the people of Anglo-Saxon England. The proverbs were used in monastic schools to teach text along with other manuscripts such as the ''[[Disticha Catonis]]'' (also known as the "Dicts of Cato") and a Middle English collection titled the [[Proverbs of Hendyng]]. Several of the proverbs have parallels within other proverbs listed below, as well as the Old English Disticha Catonis and the Proverbs of Hendyng. Despite their use, the source of these proverbs is largely debated and still considered unknown.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Olof Arngart's notes on the Durham Proverbs say that some of the proverbs have a biblical reference. The book of Proverbs in the Bible resembles the Durham Proverbs by providing teachings on morals for a society of its time. The "Dicts of Cato" were also influenced by the Durham Proverbs, which in turn, influenced Christianity.{{sfn|Treharne|2003|pp=470&amp;ndash;471}}  The first of the Durham Proverbs can even be seen in the Dict of Cato 23.{{sfn|Treharne|2003|pp=468}}

==Purpose==
The Durham Proverbs comprise a mixture of true proverbs and maxims, and are clearer in this regard, according to linguist and Anglo-Saxon anthropologist Nigel Barley {{harv|Barley|1972}}, than the collection of Old English poems entitled the ''[[Maxims (Old English poems)|Maxims]]'' are &amp;mdash; the latter's status being comparatively unclear.{{sfn|Poole|1998|pp=207}} According to the ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'' a maxim is a short statement that (as Laingui puts it) "sets out a general principle", that briefly expounds a liturgical, legal, moral, or political rule as a short [[mnemonic]] device.{{sfn|Laingui|1997|pp=929}}  The Durham Proverbs are called proverbs because the collection has what Marsden calls "transferability" to man.{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=302&amp;ndash;303}}

The Durham Proverbs are not as serious as some of the Old English maxims and can even be considered humorous in some areas. The proverbs are similar to fables or parables seen in Modern English. Each proverb has a lesson to teach, as do the fables and parables. It is important to note the proverbs' resemblance to Old English poetry. Using alliteration and rhythm, the proverbs show some of the earliest uses of words and phrases, such as "cwæþ se (þe)" which translates to "quoth he who", and is later seen in more Middle English sources.{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=289}}   In addition to their importance of gaining knowledge of the Old English history, the proverbs include many words that are not seen anywhere else in Old English writings. Arngart suggests that the study of the proverbs "furnishes insights into contemporary folklore and social life".{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=290}}

==The proverbs themselves==
The proverbs have their roots in [[gnomic poetry]], and show a relationship in some places to the ''Disticha Catonis'' and other works of the surviving Anglo-Saxon corpus.  The Old English versions are sometimes (but not always) alliterative, or in verse form, and employ the same formulae with "[[wikt:sceal#Old English|sceal]]" and "[[wikt:byþ#Old English|byþ]]" as other works do.  However, they have a distinctive flavour of their own, one outstanding characteristic of which is the humorous expression that they embody (as in number 11, for example) &amp;mdash; a quality that is lacking in the gnomes.{{sfn|Greenfield|Calder|Lapidge|1996|pp=100}}{{sfn|Fulk|Cain|Anderson|2003|pp=167}}  A yet more distinctive feature is how often the proverbs echo the verse of other works, such as the echo of ''[[The Wanderer (poem)|The Wanderer]]'' in number 23.{{sfn|Fulk|Cain|Anderson|2003|pp=167}}

Below are the first 25 Durham Proverbs:
:Geþyld byð middes ēades.
:
:Frēond dēah feor ge nēah: byð near nyttra.
:
:Æt þearfe mann sceal freonda cunnian.
:
:Nafað ǣnigmann frēonda tō feala.
:
:Beforan his frēonde biddeþ, sē þe his wǣdel mǣneþ.
:
:Gōd gēr byþ þonne se hund þām hrefne gyfeð.
::''"It is a good year when the hound gives to the raven."''
:Oft on sōtigum bylige searowa licgað.
:
:Hwīlum æfter medo menn mǣst geþyrsteð.
:
:Æfter leofan menn langað swīðost.
:
:Nū hit ys on swīnes dōme, cwæð se ceorl sæt on eoferes hricge.
:
:Ne swā þēah trēowde þēah þū teala ēode, cwæþ sē þe geseah hægtessan æfter hēafde geongan.
::''"Nonetheless, I would not trust you though you walked well.", said he who saw a witch passing along on her head.''{{sfn|Fulk|Cain|Anderson|2003|pp=167}}{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=296}}
:Eall on mūðe þæt on mōde.
:
:Gemǣne sceal māga feoh.
:
:Man dēþ swā hē byþ þonne hē mōt swā hē wile.
:
:Ne saga sagan, cwæð sē gesēah hwer fulne hēalena sēoþan.
:
::Marsden suggests there is a word that has been omitted here, and thus there is an unclear translation that could hold various meanings. When Marsden attempted to compare this to the Latin version, it was quite different. Marsden says, "So far, we must accept defeat on this one".{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=306}}
:Eaðe wīs man mæg witan spell and ēac secgan.
:
:Blind byþ bām ēagum, sē þe brēostum ne starat.
:
:Ðā ne sacað þe ætsamne ne bēoð.
:
:Ne dēah eall sōþ āsǣd ne eall sār ætwiten.
::''It does no good (for) all truth (to be) told nor all wrong imputed.''{{sfn|Robinson|1982|pp=4,262}}
::For subsequent variations on this same proverb, from Chaucer to [[William Horman|Horman]]'s ''[[Grammarians' War|Vulgaria]]'', see {{harvnb|Whiting|Whiting|1968|pp=533}}.{{sfn|Robinson|1982|pp=4,262}}
:Gyf þū well sprece, wyrc æfter swā.
:&lt;!-- 21: missing --&gt;
:Earh mæg þæt an þæt he him ondræde.
::''A coward can do only one thing: fear.''{{sfn|Arngart|1981|pp=293}}{{sfn|Marsden|2004|pp=306}}
::"[[wikt:earh#Old English|earh]]" means coward here and is glossed as such in contemporary works ("timidorum militum" in Aldhelm's ''[[De Virginitate]]'' being translated as "eargra cempana"), although the more general meaning of the word in O.E. was "sloth" or "sluggard".{{sfn|Abels|2006|pp=34&amp;ndash;35}}
:Nē sceal man tō ǣr forht nē tō ǣr fægen.
::''One should be neither too soon fearful nor too soon glad.''{{sfn|Fulk|Cain|Anderson|2003|pp=167}}
::The proverb has echoes of ''The Wanderer'' ("nē tō forht nē tō fægen", 150).{{sfn|Fulk|Cain|Anderson|2003|pp=167}}{{sfn|Gwara|2008|pp=94}} The twain have been variously translated.  T. A. Shippey, who writes the O.E. of the ''Proverbs'' as "ǣrforht" and "ǣrfægen", explains "glad-too-soon" as meaning optimistic.  The Latin version of the proverb, it should be noted, is "nec ilico arrigens", which translates as "nor quick to rouse" rather than the "glad" or "happy" usually ascribed to the O.E. form.{{sfn|Gwara|2008|pp=94}}  (For further exploration of the Latin by Arngart see {{harvnb|Arngart|1983}}.{{sfn|Hollis|Wright|1992|pp=47}})

The Province of Ontario granted $10 million to the University of Waterloo Stratford Stratford Campus on 26 March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bulletin.uwaterloo.ca/2008/mar/27th.html Future for UW in Stratford]&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Waterloo-based enterprise software company [[OpenText]] announced that they had committed $10 million to the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kwrecord.org/article/328208 Open Text announces $10M for UW digital media campus]&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:6WellingtonStCampus.jpg|thumb|The University of Waterloo Stratford Campus was originally located at 6 Wellington St. in Stratford, Ontario.]]

On 22 January 2009, the federal government announced that it was pledging $10.7 million over five years for the Corridor for Advancing Canadian Digital Media - now known as the Canadian Digital Media initiative under the Canadian Digital Media Network (CDMN) – a joint initiative between Communitech and University of Waterloo Stratford Campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?archive=true&amp;e=1401907 Ottawa kicks in millions]&lt;/ref&gt; In June of the same year, the first ever [[Canada 3.0]] forum in Stratford, ON was hosted by the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus and CDMN. The event was the official launch of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.uwaterloo.ca/pipermail/uw-news-release/2009-May/000929.html Canada 3.0 Forum to Shape the Country’s Digital Future]&lt;/ref&gt;

The official opening of the campus took place on 20 September 2010 at its temporary location at 6 Wellington St., Stratford, Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=2766778 U of Waterloo showcases new Stratford campus]&lt;/ref&gt; The first class of the Master of Digital Experience Innovation (MDEI) – an interdisciplinary, professional one-year program - began at the temporary campus the following year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratfordbeaconherald.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=3288539&amp;archive=true University of Waterloo Stratford site greets first 17]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2011, Dr. Christine McWebb, Professor in the Department of French Studies, UW becomes the Director, Academic Programs and on 1 October 2011, Ginny Dybenko, the former Dean of the Wilfrid Laurier School of Business &amp; Economics, becomes the Executive Director of the University of Waterloo Stratford Campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.lfpress.com/news/london/2011/09/07/18650071.html|author=Beitz, Mike|title=Digital dream now reality|accessdate=7 September 2011|publisher=QMI Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''VALS''' ("Values and Lifestyles")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Vals Definition by SRI|url=https://www.sri.com/sites/default/timeline/timeline.php?timeline=business-entertainment#!&amp;innovation=vals-market-research}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a proprietary research methodology used for [[psychographic]] [[market segmentation]]. VALS is a way of viewing people on the basis of their attitudes, needs, wants, beliefs and demographics. By using psychology to analyze and predict consumer preferences and choices, the VALS system constructs a link between personality traits and buying behavior.The system identifies current and future opportunities by segmenting the consumer market place on the basis of the personality traits that drive consumer behavior&lt;ref&gt;Raj, Mohan, M. Prasanna, and A. K. Sait. "Psychographic Profiling of Indian Young Adult Consumers of Smartphone-VALS Approach." Management Studies and Economic Systems 2, no. 2 (2015): 95-102.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and description==
VALS was developed in 1978 by social scientist and consumer futurist [[Arnold Mitchell]] and his colleagues at [[SRI International]]. It was immediately embraced by advertising agencies and is currently offered as a product of SRI's consulting services division. VALS draws heavily on the work of Harvard sociologist [[David Riesman]] and psychologist [[Abraham Maslow]].&lt;ref name=HBR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yankelovich|first=Daniel|title=Rediscovering Market Segmentation|author2=David Meer |journal=Harvard Business Review|date=February 6, 2006|pages=1–11|url=http://www.viewpointlearning.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/segmentation_0206.pdf|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell used statistics to identify attitudinal and [[demographic]] questions that helped categorize adult American consumers into one of nine lifestyle types: survivors (4%), sustainers (7%), belongers (35%), emulators (9%), achievers (22%), I-am-me (5%), experiential (7%), societally conscious (9%), and integrated (2%). The questions were weighted using data developed from a sample of 1,635 Americans and their [[significant other]]s, who responded to an SRI International survey in 1980.&lt;ref name=ACR&gt;{{cite journal|last=Beatty|first=Sharon E.|author2=Pamela M. Homer |author3=Lynn R. Kahle |title=Problems With Vals in International Marketing Research: an Example From an Application of the Empirical Mirror Technique|journal=Advances in Consumer Research|year=1988|volume=15|pages=375–380|url=http://www.acrwebsite.org/volumes/display.asp?id=6655|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main dimensions of the VALS framework are resources (the [[Y-axis|vertical dimension]]) and primary motivation (the [[X-axis|horizontal dimension]]). The vertical dimension segments people based on the degree to which they are [[innovative]] and have resources such as [[income]], [[education]], [[self-confidence]], [[intelligence]], leadership skills, and energy. The horizontal dimension represents primary motivations and includes three distinct types:

* Consumers driven by [[knowledge]] and [[Value (personal and cultural)|principles]] are motivated primarily by ''[[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]]''. These consumers include groups called Thinkers and Believers.
* Consumers driven by demonstrating success to their peers are motivated primarily by ''achievement''. These consumers include groups referred to as Achievers and Strivers.
* Consumers driven by a desire for [[social]] or [[physical activity]], variety, and risk taking are motivated primarily by ''self-expression''. These consumers include the groups known as Experiencers and Makers.

At the top of the rectangle are the [[Innovator]]s, who have such high resources that they could have any of the three primary motivations. At the bottom of the rectangle are the Survivors, who live complacently and within their means without a strong primary motivation of the types listed above. The VALS Framework gives more details about each of the groups.

==VALS2==
Researchers faced some problems with the VALS method, and in response, SRI developed the VALS2 programme in 1978; additionally, SRI significantly revised it in 1989. VALS2 places less emphasis on activities and interests and more on a psychological base to tap relatively enduring attitudes and values. The VALS2 program has two dimensions. The first dimension, Self-orientation, determines the type of goals and behaviours that individuals will pursue, and refers to patterns of attitudes and activities which help individuals reinforce, sustain, or modify their social self-image. This is a fundamental human need. 

The second dimension, Resources, reflects the ability of individuals to pursue their dominant self-orientation and includes full-range of physical, psychological, demographic, and material means such as self-confidence, interpersonal skills, inventiveness, intelligence, eagerness to buy, money, position, education, etc. According to VALS 2, a consumer purchases certain products and services because the individual is a specific type of person. The purchase is believed to reflect a consumer’s lifestyle, which is a function of self–orientation and resources. 

In 1991, the name VALS2 was switched back to VALS, because of [[brand equity]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VALS™ Survey Help|url=http://ww.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/help.shtml#12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Criticisms==
[[Psychographic]] segmentation has been criticized by well-known public opinion analyst and social scientist [[Daniel Yankelovich]], who says psychographics are "very weak" at predicting people's purchases, making it a "very poor" tool for corporate decision-makers.&lt;ref name=HBR /&gt; 

The VALS Framework has also been criticized as too culturally specific for international use.&lt;ref name=ACR /&gt; 

==VALS Framework and Segment==

The following types correspond to VALS segments of US adults based on two concepts for understanding consumers: primary motivation and resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=US Framework and VALS™ Types|url=http://www.strategicbusinessinsights.com/vals/ustypes.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Innovators.''''' These consumers are on the leading edge of change, have the highest incomes, and such high self-esteem and abundant resources that they can indulge in any or all self-orientations. They are located above the rectangle. Image is important to them as an expression of taste, [[independence]], and [[Persona|character]]. Their consumer choices are directed toward the "finer things in life."
*'''''Thinkers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by ideals. They are mature, responsible, well-educated professionals. Their [[leisure]] activities center on their homes, but they are well informed about what goes on in the world and are open to new ideas and [[social change]]. They have high incomes but are practical consumers and rational decision makers.
*'''''Believers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by ideals. They are [[conservative]] and predictable consumers who favor local products and established brands. Their lives are centered on [[family]], [[community]], and the nation. They have modest incomes.
*'''''Achievers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by achievement. They are successful work-oriented people who get their satisfaction from their jobs and families. They are [[politically conservative]] and respect authority and the status quo. They favor established products and services that show off their success to their peers.
*'''''Strivers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by achievements. They have values very similar to achievers but have fewer economic, social, and psychological resources. Style is extremely important to them as they strive to emulate people they admire.
*'''''Experiencers.''''' These consumers are the high-resource group of those who are motivated by self-expression. They are the youngest of all the segments, with a median age of 25. They have a lot of energy, which they pour into [[physical exercise]] and social activities. They are avid consumers, spending heavily on clothing, fast-foods, music, and other youthful favorites, with particular emphasis on new products and services.
*'''''Makers.''''' These consumers are the low-resource group of those who are motivated by self-expression. They are practical people who value self-sufficiency. They are focused on the familiar - family, [[employment|work]], and physical recreation - and have little interest in the broader world. As consumers, they appreciate practical and functional products.
*'''''Survivors.''''' These consumers have the lowest incomes. They have too few resources to be included in any consumer self-orientation and are thus located below the rectangle. They are the oldest of all the segments, with a median age of 61. Within their limited means, they tend to be brand-loyal consumers.

===Use of the VALS Framework===
There is little to no evidence of the use of this framework on a wide basis by any other industry other than the ad industry as indicated by SRI on what little it shares on its website (go to the SRI website for more info).

'''Vera Martha Winitzky de Spinadel''' (August 22, 1929 – January 26, 2017, [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]) was an [[Argentine]] [[mathematician]]. She was the first woman to gain a [[PhD]] in mathematics at the [[University of Buenos Aires]], Argentina, in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://digital.bl.fcen.uba.ar/Download/Tesis/Tesis_0970_WinitzkydeSpinadel.pdf|title= Doctoral thesis Dr. Vera W. de Spinadel: Dissertation: Theory of Reachable Zones in Bi-dimensional Systems Mathematics Subject Classification: 49—Calculus of variations and optimal control|publisher=University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Exact and Natural Sciences |accessdate=May 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2010 and 2017, she was full [[Emeritus Professor]] in the Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urban Planning of the University of Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.fadu.uba.ar/categoria/35-institutos-centros-programas|title= Research Locations |publisher=University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urban Planning |accessdate=May 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, she was named Director of the [[Centre of Mathematics and Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://uba.academia.edu/VeraMarthaWinitzkydeSpinadel |title= Reaearcher UBA |publisher=University of Buenos Aires, Faculty of Architecture, Design and Urban Planning |accessdate=May 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In April 2005 she inaugurated the Laboratory of Mathematics &amp; Design, University Campus in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ams.org/news/in-memory/in-memory|title= In Memory |publisher= American Mathematic Society |accessdate=May 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to her death she was the President of the [[International Mathematics and Design Association]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.maydi.org.ar/ |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20040417042032/http://www.maydi.org.ar/ |dead-url= yes |archive-date= April 17, 2004 |title= International Mathematics &amp; Design Association|publisher= International Mathematics &amp; Design Association |accessdate=May 4, 2017  }}&lt;/ref&gt; which organizes international congresses every 3 years and publishes a Journal of Mathematics &amp; Design.

A '''vulnerable''' [[species]] is one which has been [[Conservation status|categorized]] by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] as likely to become [[Endangered species|endangered]] unless the circumstances that are [[threatened species|threatening]] its survival and [[reproduction]] improve.

Vulnerability is mainly caused by [[habitat loss]] or destruction of the species home. Vulnerable habitat or species are monitored and can become increasingly threatened. Some species listed as "vulnerable" may be common in [[captivity (animal)|captivity]], an example being the [[military macaw]].

There are currently 5196 [[animal]]s and 6789 [[plant]]s classified as vulnerable, compared with 1998 levels of 2815 and 3222, respectively.&lt;ref name="iucn 2012.2"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iucnredlist.org/documents/summarystatistics/2012_2_RL_Stats_Table_2.pdf | title = IUCN Red List version 2012.2: Table 2: Changes in numbers of species in the threatened categories (CR, EX, VU) from 1996 to 2012 (IUCN Red List version 2012.2) for the major taxonomic groups on the Red List | accessdate = 2012-12-31 | author = [[IUCN]] | date = 2012 | format = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Practices such as [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]] have been enforced in efforts to conserve vulnerable breeds of livestock specifically.

==Criteria==
The [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] uses several criteria to enter species in this category. A [[taxon]] is Vulnerable when it is not [[critically endangered]] or Endangered but is facing a high risk of extinction in the wild in the medium-term future, as defined by any of the following criteria (A to E):

'''A) Population reduction in the form of either of the following:'''

#An observed, estimated, inferred or suspected population size reduction of ≥ 50% over the last 10 years or three generations, whichever is the longer, provided the causes of the reduction are clearly reversible AND understood AND ceased.&lt;ref name=iucnvu&gt;http://www.iucnredlist.org/static/categories_criteria_3_1#critical&lt;/ref&gt; This measurement is based on (and specifying) any of the following:
##direct observation
##an index of abundance appropriate for the taxon
##a decline in area of occupancy, extent of occurrence or quality of habitat
##actual or potential levels of exploitation
##the effects of [[Introduced species|introduced taxa]], [[hybrid (biology)|hybridisation]], pathogens, [[pollutants]], competitors or [[parasites]].
#A reduction of at least 20%, projected or suspected to be met within the next ten years or three generations, whichever is the longer, based on (and specifying) any of (2), (3), (4) or (5) above.

'''B) Extent of occurrence estimated to be less than 20,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or area of occupancy estimated to be less than 2000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and estimates indicating any two of the following:
'''

#Severely fragmented or known to exist at no more than ten locations.
#Continuing decline, inferred, observed or projected, in any of the following:
##extent of occurrence
##area of occupancy
##area, extent or quality of habitat
##number of locations or subpopulations
##number of mature individuals
#Extreme fluctuations in any of the following:
##extent of occurrence
##area of occupancy
##number of locations or subpopulations
##number of mature individuals

'''C) Population estimated to number fewer than 10,000 mature individuals and either:'''

#An estimated continuing decline of at least 10% within 10 years or three generations, whichever is longer, or
#A continuing decline, observed, projected, or inferred, in numbers of mature individuals and population structure in the form of either:
##severely fragmented (i.e. no subpopulation estimated to contain more than 1000 mature individuals)
##all mature individuals are in a single subpopulation

'''D) Population very small or restricted in the form of either of the following:'''

#Population estimated to number less than 1000 mature individuals.
#Population is characterised by an acute restriction in its area of occupancy (typically less than 20&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;ref name=iucnvu /&gt; or in the number of locations (typically less than five). Such a taxon would thus be prone to the effects of human activities (or stochastic events whose impact is increased by human activities) within a very short period of time in an unforeseeable future, and is thus capable of becoming Critically Endangered or even Extinct in a very short period.

'''Zwi Migdal''' ({{lang-yi|צבי מגדל}}, {{IPA-yi|ˈtsvɪ mɪɡˈdal|IPA}}) was a [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish Jewish]] 19th and 20th-century [[organized crime]] group, based mainly in [[Argentina]], that was involved in the [[Human trafficking|trafficking]] of Jewish women from the [[shtetl]]s of [[Central Europe]] for [[sexual slavery]] and [[forced prostitution]].&lt;ref name=perush&gt;{{cite web|last=Yarfitz|first=Mir|title=Caftens, Kurvehs, and Stille Chuppahs: Jewish Sex Workers and their Opponents in Buenos Aires, 1890-1930|url=http://perush.cjs.ucla.edu/index.php/volume-2/jewish-urban-history-in-comparative-perspective-jewish-buenos-aires-and-jewish-los-angeles/-6-mir-yarfitz-caftens-kurvehs-and-stille-chuppahs-jewish-sex-workers-and-their-opponents-in-buenos-aires-1890-1930|work=Perush: An Online Journal of Jewish Scholarship and Interpretation. Volume 2.|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=February 8–9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin of the name ==
The founders, having originated from [[Warsaw]], called the organization the Varsovia Jewish Mutual Aid Society. In 1927, after the [[Poland|Polish]] envoy in [[Argentina]] filed an official complaint against them with the local authorities regarding their use of "Warsaw" in the name, they changed it to Zwi Migdal in honor of Luis Zvi Migdal, one of the founders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Guy|first=Donna J|title=Sex and Danger in Buenos Aires: Prostitution, Family, and Nation in Argentina|year=1992|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=2cT8CrTRVKAC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BXxOTd7OOcP68AbKiI22Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false|pages=120–125}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Zwi Migdal organization operated from the 1860s to 1939. After the [[First World War]], it had four hundred members in [[Argentina]]. Its annual turnover was fifty million dollars at the turn of the century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Its center was [[Buenos Aires]], with branch offices in [[Brazil]] ([[Rio de Janeiro]], [[São Paulo]] and [[Santos, São Paulo|Santos]]), [[United States]] ([[New York City]]), [[Poland]] ([[Warsaw]]), [[South Africa]], [[India]] and [[China]].&lt;ref name="kushnir"&gt;Kushnir, Beatriz; Baile de Máscaras, Imago Editora, São Paulo. {{ISBN|85-312-0485-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zwi Migdal Organization reached its peak in the 1920s: 430 ruffians, or [[pimp]]s, controlled 2,000 [[brothel]]s with 4,000 women in Argentina alone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403899,00.html "Argentine Jewry's dark secret" by Rona Kupferboim [[Ynetnews]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's success stemmed from the fact that its members were bound by rules that were "based on order, discipline, and honesty." The network was well-organized and members cooperated closely to protect their interests.

== Modus operandi ==
The organization lured girls and young women from Europe in several ways. For instance, a well-mannered and elegant-looking man would appear in a poor Jewish village in [[Poland]] or [[Russia]]. He would advertise his search for young women to work in the homes of wealthy Jews in Argentina by posting an ad in the local synagogue. Fearful of pogroms and often in desperate economic circumstances, the parents would send their daughters away with these men, hoping to give them a fresh start. Another popular ruse was to find pretty girls and marry them, usually in a ceremony known as a "shtille chupah" ([[Yiddish]] expression meaning a quick wedding ceremony). The girls bade their families farewell and boarded ships to Argentina believing that they were on their way toward a better future. Their period of training as sex slaves often started on the ship. Some of them were married off to local men so that they could obtain entry visas.

Prostitutes who failed to satisfy their clients were beaten, fined or sent to work in provincial houses. Every business transaction was logged. The rufianes held a "meat market" in which newly arrived girls were paraded naked in front of traders in places such as Hotel Palestina and [[Cafe Parisienne]]. These activities went on undisturbed because the brothels were frequented by government officials, judges and journalists. City officials, politicians and police officers were bribed. The pimps had powerful connections everywhere. The largest [[brothels]] in Buenos Aires housed as many as 60 to 80 [[sex slave]]s. Although there were brothels all over Argentina, most were in Buenos Aires, in the Jewish quarter on Junin Street.{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}}

== Influence of the organization ==
The organization had arms in several countries, and was a controversial presence in [[South America]]'s Jewish community.  It was a supporter of [[Yiddish theatre]] in [[Brazil]], but was attacked by Jews in [[Rio de Janeiro]] for presenting [[Sefer Torah|Torah scrolls]].  A great number of Jews who had come to Brazil did so as [[family|families]], and viewed [[prostitution]] as immoral and "impure" influences.  Zwi Migdal's attempt to relocate to Rio, after events in [[Buenos Aires]] (discussed below), caused an increased battle against the group among [[History of the Jews in Brazil|Brazilian Jews]].&lt;ref name="lesser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=c8JghimnHDsC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wn1OTYXvIIP98Ab0yLytDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CEwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false Lesser, Jeff. Weloming the Undesirables: Brazil and the Jewish Question. University of California Press, 1995, pgs 34-38]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Argentina, the group's activities were at times used to bolster [[antisemitism]], a use that also occurred in Brazil,&lt;ref name="moser"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dAsPpUctvocC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eoBOTdmuDoP98AaV3qmdDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false Moser, Benjamin. Why this world? A Biography of Clarice Lispector, pg 85]&lt;/ref&gt; where the Jewish community also often opposed the organization.&lt;ref name="agosin"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=LLXo2mwXX5YC&amp;pg=PA189&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Wn1OTYXvIIP98Ab0yLytDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false Agosín, Marjorie. Memory, Oblivion, and Jewish Culture in Latin America, pg 190]&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically the group was cited in relation to negative views of [[Ashkenazi Jews|Eastern European Jews]], who were at times seen as more prone to [[crime|criminality]] and/or [[political radicalism]] within Argentinian society, as opposed to [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CzOsAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=eoBOTdmuDoP98AaV3qmdDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false Newton, Ronald C. The "Nazi menace" in Argentina, 1931-1947, pg 34]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chile]]an [[Nicolás Palacios]] used their crimes in claims Jews "dominated" Argentina's women and were "polluting" that nation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8AoUz2G-GecC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=%22zwi+migdal%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=rYFOTbqMHo-p8AbX99ycDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=%22zwi%20migdal%22&amp;f=false Las Derechas: The Extreme Right in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, 1890-1939 by Sandra McGee Deutsch, pg 28]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Shunning by Jewish community ==
As the pimps prospered, the Argentinian Jewish community rejected them. Articles condemning the rufianes appeared in the local press, and in 1885, the community established the Jewish Association for the Protection of Women and Girls. Notices posted on the walls of the Jewish quarter warned locals not to rent to the rufianes. Nevertheless, the pimps aspired to be part of the community. The wealthiest were patrons of the [[Secular Jewish culture#Theatre|Jewish theater]], which was the center of Jewish cultural life in Buenos Aires. Despite their trade, Zwi Migdal members donated funds for the construction of synagogues and other community buildings. Community leaders were divided on whether to accept these donations, some fearing that accepting "dirty" money would legitimize the exploitation of women.  Later the "tmeyim" (unclean), as they were known, pimps and prostitutes alike, were banned from synagogues and refused burial in the local Jewish cemetery.

== Splinter groups ==
Zwi Migdal later split and a splinter group led by [[Simon Rubinstein (pimp)|Simon Rubinstein]] established its own society named [[Ashkenazum]]. Once officially recognized, both associations bought plots of land on the outskirts of Buenos Aires and established their own cemeteries there.

== Downfall ==
[[File:Raquel Liberman.PNG|thumb|[[Raquel Liberman]] in the 1930s.]]
The organization worked to force [[Raquel Liberman]] ([[Berdychiv]], Ukraine 1900-Buenos Aires, Argentina 1935),&lt;ref&gt;[https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/liberman-raquel Glickman, Nora. "Raquel Liberman." Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 1 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive.] (Visited September 6th 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; a former prostitute, to return to prostitution.  Liberman had emigrated to Argentina after her husband, who died a year after her arrival, leaving her with two small sons.  
To support them she worked as prostitute, until saving enough money to open an antique shop, which was later raided by local [[pimps]] who robbed her of her savings and forced her back to prostitution. There Liberman contacted the police superintendent, Julio Alsogaray, whom she had heard would not accept [[Bribery|bribes]] from Zwi Migdal, and was looking for ways to destroy the organization. Slipping into his office one day, she gave detailed testimony on the workings of Zwi Migdal, thus enabling the police to launch an extensive investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3403899,00.html Kupferboim, Rona. Argentine Jewry's Dark Secret. Article in Ynetnews.com about Ilan Sheinfeld's book. Published May 25th, 2007] (Visited December 3rd, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; The case was handled by an investigative [[judge]], Dr. Rodriguez Ocampo, who also refused to be bribed.  The lengthy [[trial]] ended in September 1930, with 108 criminal convictions. "''The very existence of the Zwi Migdal Organization directly threatens our society''," Judge Ocampo wrote in his [[verdict]], handing down long [[prison]] sentences.  The pimps appealed their sentences from prison in January 1931, and senior Justice Ministry officials released all but three of them.  After this was reported in the media, public outrage convinced the authorities to rescind the releases. Later, hundreds of pimps were deported to [[Uruguay]], but slowly returned over the years, one by one.

== Zwi Migdal in Brazil ==
The first boatload of young Jewish women arrived in Brazil in 1867. In 1872, the imperial Brazilian government extradited some Jewish pimps and prostitutes, but the criminal activities continued. The brothels were concentrated in a few streets near downtown, in the Mangue neighborhood, a city zone where prostitution was segregated and legally authorized. As most of the prostitutes came from Poland, they were called "''polacas''" ("Polish women") and this word acquired a scornful meaning in Brazilian Portuguese language.

By 1913, there were 431 brothels controlled by the Zwi Migdal in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. They were concentrated in a few streets near downtown, in the ''Mangue'' neighborhood, a city zone where prostitution was commonplace and tolerated.

The prostitutes, largely illiterate, poor and despised by the mainstream Jewish community, banded together to form their own self benevolent societies. In 1906 they formed in [[Rio de Janeiro]] their own [[Chesed Shel Emes]] or Society of True Charity, formally registered as "Associação Beneficente Funerária e Religiosa Israelita" - ABFRI (Jewish Benevolent Association for Burial and Religion). Note that this organization was created and run by women exploited by Zwi Migdal and other Jewish crime syndicates, but they had no connection with criminal activities.

That social and religious organization was created and managed mainly by the Polish-Jewish  prostitutes ("''polacas''") exploited by Jewish crime syndicates. Their main goals, they wrote in the founding charter, were: "to set up a synagogue, and there practice all the ceremonies of the Jewish religion; to grant sick members in need of treatment outside the city a third-class train ticket and three pounds sterling; to grant members a third-class funeral." Despite their troubled life and social despise, these women never forgot that they were Jewish.

Using their association savings, they purchased real-state properties and founded their own cemetery in 1916 and their own synagogue in 1942. In its heyday, several Brazilian cities had its own Chesed Shel Emes associations and several rabbis, all since deceased, were employed by the communities. Rio de Janeiro's Chesed Shel Emes association was the largest one. It was led by one of their own elected freely and called "Irmã Superiora" ("superior sister"), who used a large blue ribbon across her chest during reunions and feasts.

The [[Buenos Aires]] police enforcement, led by [[Julio Rodolfo Alsogaray|Julio Alsogaray]], gave a deep blow in Jewish crime syndicates that affected their activities even in [[Brazil]]. The destruction of the Jewish communities in Eastern Europe during the World War II eliminated the last links between South American and European Jewish crimes syndicates. After 1939, the Jewish women traffic ceased, but Jewish women could be found in the Brazilian prostitution zones until the end of the 1950s.

Rio de Janeiro's Chesed Shel Emes had four "Irmãs Superioras" ("superior sisters"); the last one was Rebeca Freedman, also known as Rebeka Fridman or "''dona'' Beka" (Ms. Beka). The other women used to refer to her as their queen. Although born in Poland, she came to Brazil around 1916 from the United States when she was about 35 years old. Certainly she followed some connections between New York and [[Rio de Janeiro]] crime syndicates. Deeply religious, she made her mission to perform the sacred ''[[Tumah and taharah|tahara]]'' ceremony of washing the dead and provide a proper Jewish burial for all her "sisters". She died in 1984 at the age of 103.

The Jewish women benevolent organizations ceased to exist when all their members died, married or moved to other cities. As no new member joined, the number of "sisters" dwindled and their association assets were eventually donated to or purchased by the "respectable" Jewish associations. As part of the bargain, some women were accepted in their final days in Jewish rest homes for elderly people, but many of them died in deep poverty in public rest home with beggars. Some of them married Jews or non-Jewish men and were absorbed by the respectful Brazilian society. Most of the resistance to tell their History can be attributed to their descendants who live today a very comfortable and prominent life.

=== Legacy ===
The cemeteries created by the Jewish prostitutes associations were the starting point in the recognition and interest in those women's history. They are being restored and preserved by members of the Brazilian Jewish community despite the heavy opposition of other members who feel uneasy or ashamed about the past of their friends, fellows or ancestors. In [[Cubatão]] City, [[São Paulo State]], there is a Jewish cemetery that was recently restored. In [[São Paulo]] City, due to municipal ordinances, almost all the Jewish women's tombs were removed in 1971 from their original place in Chora-Menino Cemetery to anonymous tombs close to the walls of the Butantã Jewish Cemetery. Recently, some members of the Jewish community respectfully engraved on each tombstone the name of each woman there buried. In [[Rio de Janeiro]], the Chesed Shel Emes' Cemetery, located close to the Inhaúma Cemetery, with almost 800 tombs, is abandoned, but some social organizations work to protect, restore and preserve it.

=== Brazilian Portuguese vocabulary ===
The word "cafetão" (pimp) is derived from [[caftan]],&lt;ref name="etymology"&gt;Cunha, Antonio Geraldo da. Dicionário Etimológico da Língua Portuguesa. Editora Nova Fronteira, Rio de Janeiro, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; the long coat traditionally used by Eastern Europe Jews. The word "polaca" (Polish woman), as well as "la polaquita" ( a little Pole, feminin, sub.) is commonly used in countries where Portuguese is spoken, but in Brazil it became extremely offensive to Polish people because it was used as synonymous to prostitute.&lt;ref name="lesser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="moser"/&gt;&lt;ref name="agosin"/&gt; So the words "polonesa" and "polonês" (Polish woman and Polish man) were created and are the only socially accepted in Brazil to name people from Poland.&lt;ref name="etymology"/&gt; As French pimps mainly from [[Marseille]] also bought women from to work as prostitutes in Brazil, the word "''francesa''" (Frenchwoman) also had the same fate, but it is still used in Brazilian Portuguese without a pejorative meaning. The word "encrenca", nowadays meaning trouble, derived from the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] "en krenk" (a sick one, similar to the German "ein Kranker"), and originally referred to a man with venereal diseases.

== Cultural and literary references ==
The trafficking of women for sex work found mention in Yiddish literature. Among theater plays which raised the subject were Peretz Hirschbein’s “Miriam” (1905-1908) and the directly focused Leib Malach’s "Ibergus" (1927).&lt;ref name=perush /&gt; Among Yiddish prose, the subject featured in [[Sholem Aleichem]]'s "The Man from Buenos Aires" (Yiddish: “Der Mentsch fun Buenos Aires,” 1909, English: 1987)&lt;ref name=perush /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Miron|first=Dan|title=Journey to the Twilight Zone: on Shalom Aleichem's Railroad Stories|work=The Image of the Shtetl and Other Studies of Modern Jewish Literary Imagination|publisher=Syracuse University Press|page=268|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aleichem|first1=Sholem|title=Tevye the Dairyman and The Railroad Stories|year=1987|publisher=Schocken Books|location=New York|first2=Hillel|last2=Halkin|chapter=The Man from Buenos Aires}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more recently in [[Isaac Bashevis Singer]]'s "Scum" (Yiddish: "Shoym", year?; English: 1991).

The 1979 movie ''[[Last Embrace]]'' by [[Jonathan Demme]] (based on the novel ''[[The Thirteenth Man (novel)|The Thirteenth Man]]'' by [[Murray Teigh Bloom]] and a screenplay by [[David Shaber]]&lt;ref name="Glickman2"&gt;[http://www.tandfebooks.com/doi/pdf/10.4324/9780203905128?isOnline=false The Jewish White Slave Trade and the Untold Story of Raquel Liberman], page 51, [[Nora Glickman]], [[Latin American Studies]], Volume 14, [[Garland Reference Library of Social Science]], Volume 2130. {{ISBN|0-203-90512-1}}, {{ISBN|0-203-90605-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;) features a woman who, taking the role of the biblical avenger [[Goel Hadam]], serially kills the members of the New York [[Lower East Side]] Zwi Migdal who enslaved her grandmother.

The 1991 movie ''[[Naked Tango]]'' by [[Leonard Schrader]] alludes to the activities of Zwi Migdal.&lt;ref name="Glickman"&gt;Glickman, Nora. The Jewish White Slave Trade and the Untold Story of Raquel Liberman.  Routledge, 1999. {{ISBN|0-203-90512-1}} / {{ISBN|978-0-203-90512-8}}. ([https://books.google.de/books?hl=de&amp;id=ABsfWWlxeYIC&amp;q=naked+tango#v=snippet&amp;q=naked%20tango&amp;f=false online])&lt;/ref&gt; The film's heroine assumes the identity of an Eastern European woman traveling to Buenos Aires to meet a prospective husband and in the process gets herself caught up in the prostitution network. The film, however, is motivated more by sensationalism than by indignation.

The 2001 movie ''[[:pt:Sonhos Tropicais|Sonhos Tropicais]]'' ("Tropical Dreams"), directed by André Sturm, also deals with the same topic, following Esther, a Jewish girl from Poland lured into a false promise of marriage, who finds herself enslaved in brothels in Rio de Janeiro from 1899 to 1904. As a background, the film shows the [[Vaccine Revolt]] in the city.
