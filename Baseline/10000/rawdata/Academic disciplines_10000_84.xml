'''Alexander Souter''' (14 August 1873 – 17 January 1949&lt;ref&gt;{{BBKL|s/souter_a|band=10|autor= Johannes Madey|artikel= Souter, Alexander|spalten=844-845}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[biblical scholar]].

==Biography==
Souter was born in [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], and studied at the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. He subsequently became a [[Latin language|Latin]] assistant at Aberdeen. While at Cambridge he studied under [[J. E. B. Mayor]], whom Souter would credit with influence on his later scholarship.&lt;ref name=speculum&gt;{{cite journal | author = Laistner, M.L.W. |author2= Lowe, E.A.|author3= Ullman, B.L. | title = Alexander Souter (in Memoirs of Fellows and Corresponding Fellows of the Mediaeval Academy) | journal = [[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]] | volume = 25 | issue = 3 | year = 1950 | pages = 418–419 | doi = 10.1017/s0038713400174597 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 he was appointed professor of [[New Testament Greek]] and [[Exegesis]] at [[Mansfield College, Oxford]]. In 1911 he moved back to the University of Aberdeen, succeeding [[William Mitchell Ramsay|William Ramsay]] as [[Regius Professor of Humanity]], in which position he remained until his retirement in 1937.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt;

Upon his retirement, Souter moved back to Oxford, where he became editor-in-chief of the proposed ''[[Oxford Latin Dictionary]]''. The outbreak of World War II prevented its completion within his lifetime, but Souter did publish a smaller work borne of this endeavor, ''Glossary of Later Latin, A.D. 150–600''.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt;

Souter married Elizabeth Barr Anderson, daughter of Aberdeen Photographer William Blair Anderson. They had three daughters, Isabella Elise Souter (who married Alfred Dixon) born in 1901, Elizabeth Barr Anderson Souter born in 1903 and Alexandra Margaret Souter (known as Peggy, who married Peter Jackson) born in 1908. His brother-in-law was William Blair Anderson, who was Kennedy Professor of Latin at Cambridge University and a leading Latin scholar of his day.

==Scholarship==
Souter's two main interests were in the text of the [[New Testament]] and in early Latin commentaries on the [[Pauline epistles]]. He published an edition of the New Testament in 1910 (revised edition 1947) giving the Greek text on which the English [[Revised Version]] of 1881 was based, along with commentary on variants. His work on the Pauline epistles included proposed revisions to many accepted attributions, notably of [[Ambrosiaster]], as well as numerous commentaries on and editions of other works.&lt;ref name=speculum /&gt; A public lecture is held annually in the University of Aberdeen in memory of this scholar.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10906">The '''American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence''', often referred to as the '''American Board''', was launched with a $5 million federal grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Archibald, George, "Paige backs reform in certification of teachers, Washington Times (March 19, 2003) http://www.udel.edu/educ/whitson/897s05/files/Paige%20backs%20reform%20in%20certification%20of%20teachers.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The non-partisan, [[non-profit organization]]'s mission is to certify subject experts, experienced professionals, career changers, and military veterans as teachers and was endorsed by U.S. Education Secretary [[Rod Paige]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Shawn Arévalo McCollough]] serves as the President and Chief Executive Officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shawn Arévalo McCollough - President &amp; CEO|url = http://abcte.org/about-us/president/|website = ABCTE {{!}} American Board|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online, [[alternative certification|alternative teaching certification]] program is approved in [[Florida]], [[Idaho]], [[Mississippi]], [[Missouri]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Oklahoma]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Arkansas]], and [[Utah]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = How to Become a Teacher, Teach, Become Certified to Teach|url = http://abcte.org/teach/|website = ABCTE {{!}} American Board|accessdate = 2015-11-24|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was launched in [[Arizona]] as the Arizona Center for Teacher Preparation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;AZ TV7, http://www.aztv.com/story/22526262/arizona-center-for-teacher-preparation-to-address-teacher-shortages {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130710190426/http://www.aztv.com/story/22526262/arizona-center-for-teacher-preparation-to-address-teacher-shortages |date=2013-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Former Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] endorsed the program,&lt;ref name="AZ3"&gt;http://azctp.org/testimonials-2/&lt;/ref&gt; which addresses the shortage of math and science teachers in the state.&lt;ref name="AZ"&gt;https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/06/25/ariz-teachers-recruit-idUSnPNDC38485+1e0+PRN20130625&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The American Board is dedicated to preparing, certifying, and supporting individuals who want to improve their communities by becoming a teacher. The training and certification program is designed to inspire career changers to become a teacher and give them a rigorous and efficient process to achieve their goals.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==How it works==
The program is entirely online and self-paced. Candidates have 12 months to complete the program, though the average amount of time it takes most candidates is between 7 and 10 months. A bachelor's degree is required for acceptance into the American Board teaching certification program, and participants must pass a background check. Candidates enrolled in the program study for and take two certification exams- one that covers Professional Teaching Knowledge (PTK) and one that covers subject area knowledge. The program is online,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/post/ravitch-what-is-nctq-and-why-you-should-know/2012/05/23/gJQAg7CrlU_blog.html&lt;/ref&gt; giving candidates the flexibility to work towards earning their certification on their own time.

==Acceptance of Certifications==
American Board certification is recognized in Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Idaho, Mississippi, Missouri, New Hampshire, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah. Many [[charter school|charter]] and [[private school]]s nationwide also recognize the certification. Certification areas are [[Primary education|elementary education]], English, mathematics, general science, biology, physics, chemistry, U.S. history, world history and [[special education]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;http://abcte.org/teach/&lt;/ref&gt; Availability of certification areas and requirements vary by state.

==History==
The American Board was founded in 2001 with a grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Developed on the foundation that highly trained and skilled professionals should have the opportunity to pursue a career in teaching, the American Board was created with a mission to give enable qualified individuals a flexible and affordable path to teacher certification in their state.

The first state to accept the American Board certification for its public schools was Pennsylvania, when the State Board of Education adopted it in November 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.pateach.org/documents/teacherEdBg.htm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-07-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202113008/http://www.pateach.org/documents/teacherEdBg.htm |archive-date=2012-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  An early study of the American Board teacher certification by [[Mathematica Policy Research]] found the program to be enrolling and screening increasing numbers of candidates with the average age of nearly 40, suggesting candidates are primarily career changers with more work experience than other entry-level teachers. Most candidates were able to find teaching positions soon after finishing the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathematica-mpr.com/publications/PDFs/ABCTE.pdf “An Evaluation of American Board Teacher Certification: Progress and Plans”] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101217141845/http://mathematica-mpr.com/publications/pdfs/ABCTE.pdf |date=2010-12-17 }} Mathematica Policy Research (May 3, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, U.S. Education Secretary [[Rod Paige]] announced the American Board would receive a $35 million grant from the [[U.S. Department of Education]] for its continued development of a fast-track route into the teaching profession.&lt;ref&gt;Blair, Julie. [http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/articles/11062254/ed-dept-gives-35-million-teacher-credential-board “Ed. Dept. Gives $35 Million To Teacher-Credential Board”] Education Week (October 1, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Idaho State Board of Education approved the American Board program as a route to a full teacher license in November 2003. Idaho Governor [[Dirk Kempthorne]] said should he decide to become a teacher after politics, he would use the American Board program to become a certified teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130713023419/http://www.spokesmanreview.com/news-story.asp?date=030304&amp;ID=s1494819 “Teacher Test Draws Praise and Complaints] The Spokesman Review (March 3, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florida State Board of Education approved the American Board program in June 2004. Florida Governor [[Jeb Bush]] was a supporter,&lt;ref&gt;Hawkins, Beth. [http://www.minnpost.com/learning-curve/2011/04/jeb-bush-touts-florida-school-reforms-capitols-supportive-gop-skeptical-dfl “Jeb Bush touts Florida school reforms to Capitol's supportive GOP, skeptical DFL”] Minn Post (April 26, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;  and President [[George H.W. Bush]] received his teacher certification through an alternative program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://educationviews.org/test-3/ “George Bush Sr. Received an Alternative Teaching Certificate”] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130713023452/http://educationviews.org/test-3/ |date=2013-07-13 }} Education News (July 23, 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Utah House Standing Committee introduced HB0110 and, although it did not pass, the American Board program was approved in November 2004 by the Utah State Board of Education.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/utah-adopts-american-board-certification-helping-state/&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, the New Hampshire Commissioner of Education approved the American Board program.&lt;ref&gt;http://abcte.org/teach/new-hampshire/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mississippi Professional Standards Board approved the program in July 2006. Governor [[Haley Barbour]] said, "In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Mississippi faces years of recovery and rebuilding. To ensure that we accomplish our goals, Mississippi communities are working together to improve our schools so that every child in Mississippi has an opportunity to succeed. First and foremost, we must recruit the very best teachers for our students."&lt;ref&gt;[http://neshobademocrat.com/print.asp?ArticleID=13084&amp;SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=297 “Barbour Celebrates Launch of Teacher Certification Program”] The Neshoba Democrat (August 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[U.S. Conference of Mayors]] adopted alternative certification as a pathway to teaching and cited the American Board.&lt;ref&gt;http://usmayors.org/workforce/documents/2006RECRUITINGResolution.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina House Bill 3476 was signed into law on June 13, 2007, accepting American Board certification. Governor [[Mark Sanford]] said the program would "make a real impact in getting more qualified teachers in our classrooms, and we're pleased to welcome this program to our state."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-option-for-south-carolina-teacher-certification-58092782.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Missouri Governor [[Matt Blunt]] signed Senate Bill 1066 on May 1, 2008 allowing American Board certificate holders to practice there. The Governor said, "Under the old system, Bill Gates couldn’t teach a class in computer software in a Missouri high school. This bill allows experienced professionals to become certified teachers.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.showmedaily.org/2008/05/a-victory-for-a.html “A Victory for Certification”] Show Me Daily (May 5, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Oklahoma House passed Senate Bill 582 with a unanimous vote of 99 to zero in April 2009, and it was soon signed into law, making Oklahoma the ninth American Board state.

In July 2009, the American Board announced that the organization's initial grant had drawn to a close and it had reached a financial position that will allow the organization to continue to operate without requesting an extension of these government funds.

The Arizona Center for Teacher Preparation was launched in 2013.&lt;ref name="AZ" /&gt; Then Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]] endorsed the program,&lt;ref name="AZ3" /&gt; which addresses the shortage of math and science teachers in the state.&lt;ref name="AZ2"&gt;Gonzales, Angela “[http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2013/06/27/center-for-teacher-preparation.html "Center for teacher preparation offering $1000 scholarships for wannabe teachers"]” Phoenix Business Journal (June 27, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Aid==
The American Board for Certification of Teacher Excellence provides reduced enrollment pricing for those who fall within the parameters of the Federal Reduced Lunch Rate Act, which is based on household size, and combined income.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11802">[[Image:Aphrodite Kallipygos-Hermitage-(crop).jpg|thumb|Copy of a [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Aphrodite Kallipygos]] at [[Hermitage Museum|The Hermitage]] in [[St. Petersburg]].]]
'''Anasyrma''' ({{lang-grc|ἀνάσυρμα}}) composed of ἀνά ''ana'' "up, against, back", and σύρμα ''syrma'' "skirt"; plural: '''anasyrmata''' ({{lang|grc|ἀνασύρματα}}), also called '''anasyrmos''' ({{lang|grc|ἀνασυρμός}}),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackledge |first=Catherine |year=2009 |title=The Story of V: A Natural History of Female Sexuality |location=New Brunswick, New Jersey |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=12 |isbn=978-0813534558}}&lt;!-- year was given as 2003, might be error, might be earlier edition--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[gesture]] of lifting the [[skirt]] or [[kilt]]. It is used in connection with certain [[religion|religious]] [[ritual]]s, eroticism, and lewd jokes (see, for example, [[Baubo]]). The term is used in describing corresponding works of [[art]]. Anasyrma differs from "flashing", a physically similar gesture as an act of [[exhibitionism]], in that an exhibitionist has an implied purpose of his/her own sexual arousal, while anasyrma is done only for the effect on the onlookers.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Anasyrma is effectively "the exposing of the genitals". This is a form of exhibitionism found in religion or artwork, rather than a display for arousal, and it always refers to the act of a woman exposing herself. The act of lifting up one's skirt to display the genitals can be an [[:en:wiktionary:apotropaic|apotropaic]] device; it can, in circumstances of war, evoke the fear of the enemy. It can also be an act that evokes surprise and subsequent laughter and a letting go of sadness. What is significant about anasyrma is that it reflects the numinous quality of the female genitals and the genital region through which birth ensues. In several cultures, there is a myth of anasyrma used for emotional healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Miriam Robbins Dexter |author2=Victor H. Mair |title=Sacred Display: Divine and Magical Female Figures of Eurasia |publisher=Cambria Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-1604976748}}{{page needed|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anasyrma may be a deliberately provocative self-exposing of one's naked [[genitals]] or [[buttocks]]. The famous example of the latter case is [[Aphrodite Kallipygos]] ("Aphrodite of the beautiful buttocks"). In many traditions, this gesture also has an [[apotrope|apotropaic]] character, as a mockery or means to ward off a supernatural enemy, analogous to [[mooning]].

==Greek antiquity==
[[Image:Ermafrodito pubblicato in Marjon van der Meulen, Rubens Copies after the Antique.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Hermaphroditus|Ermafrodito]] ''anasyromenos'' sketch by [[Peter Paul Rubens]].]]
Ritual jesting and intimate exposure were common in the cults of [[Demeter]] and [[Dionysus]], and figure in the celebration of the [[Eleusinian mysteries]] associated with these divinities. The mythographer [[Apollodorus of Athens|Apollodorus]] says that Iambe's jesting was the reason for the practice of ritual jesting at the [[Thesmophoria]], a festival celebrated in honor of Demeter and Persephone. In other versions of the myth of Demeter, the goddess is received by a woman named Baubo, a [[crone]] who makes her laugh by exposing herself, in a ritual gesture called anasyrma ("lifting [of skirts]"). A set of statuettes from [[Priene]], a Greek city on the west coast of Asia Minor, are usually identified as "[[Baubo]]" figurines, representing the female body as the face conflated with the lower part of the abdomen. These appeared as counterparts to the [[phallus]]es decorated with eyes, mouth, and sometimes legs, that appeared on vase paintings and were made as statuettes.

Terracotta [[hermaphrodite]] figurines in the so-called ''anasyromenos'' pose, with female breasts and a long garment lifted to reveal male genitals have been found from [[Sicily]] to [[Lesbos]], dating back to the late [[Classical Greece|Classical]] and early [[Hellenistic period]]. The ''anasyromenos'' pose, however, was not invented in the 4th century BCE, figures of this type drew on a much earlier [[Eastern world|eastern]] [[Iconography|iconographic]] tradition employed for female divinities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ik-morphomata.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Fluide%20Ko%CC%88rper/Ajootian_abstract%26CV.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131216191227/http://www.ik-morphomata.uni-koeln.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Fluide%20Ko%CC%88rper/Ajootian_abstract%26CV.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-12-16 |author=Aileen Ajootian |title=Hermaphroditos ανασυρόμενος: Revealing the Body |publisher=University of Mississippi |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ancient literature suggests that the figures represent the androgynous Cypriot deity [[Aphroditus]] (possibly a form of [[Astarte]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/2005-ashtoreth#anchor4|title=Ashtoreth: In Arabia|publisher=[[Jewish Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=2013-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose cult was introduced into mainland Greece between the 5th–4th century BCE. The revealed [[phallus]] was believed to have [[apotropaic magic]]al powers, averting the [[evil eye]] or ''[[invidia]]'' and bestowing [[good luck]].

==Apotropaic effect of nakedness==
Many historical references suggest that anasyrma had dramatic or supernatural effect—positive or negative. [[Pliny the Elder]] wrote that a [[menstruating]] woman who uncovers her body can scare away [[hailstorms]], whirlwinds and lightning. If she strips naked and walks around the field, caterpillars, worms and beetles fall off the ears of corn. Even when not menstruating, she can lull a storm out at sea by stripping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pliny the Younger|title=Natural History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5QVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA262&amp;lpg=PA262&amp;dq=hailstorms+whirlwinds+and+lightnings+will+even+be+scared+away+by+a+woman+uncovering+her+body#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=xxviii. c.23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to folklore, women lifted their skirts to chase off enemies in [[Ireland]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=10 Questions: Miriam Robbins Dexter on the Power of Female Display |publisher=UCLA Program on Central Asia |date=October 6, 2010 |url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/asia/centralasia/article/117670 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A story from ''[[The Irish Times]]'' (September 23, 1977) reported a potentially violent incident involving several men, which was averted by a woman exposing her genitals to the attackers. According to [[Balkans|Balkan]] folklore, when it rained too much, women would run into the fields and lift their skirts to scare the gods and end the rain.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/galleries/sean-kelly-gallery/marina-abramovic-balkan-erotic-epic/ |title=Marina Abramovic: Balkan Erotic Epic |publisher=Sean Kelly Gallery |location=New York |date=December 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Jean de La Fontaine]]'s ''Nouveaux Contes'' (1674), a demon is repulsed by the sight of a woman lifting her skirt. Associated carvings, called [[sheela na gig]]s, were common on medieval churches in northern Europe and the British Isles.

In some nations of [[Africa]], a woman stripping naked and displaying herself is still considered a curse and a means to ward off evil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Alexis Okeowo | title = The Ivory Coast Effect | url = http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/the-ivory-coast-effect | date = March 21, 2011 | work = The New Yorker | accessdate = 2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; As women give life, they can take it away. In [[Nigeria]], among other places, women invoked the curse only under the most extreme circumstances, and men who are exposed are considered dead. No one will cook for them, marry them, enter into any kind of contract with them or buy anything from them. The curse extends to foreign men as well, who will go impotent or suffer some great harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080525164953/http://www.imow.org/wpp/stories/viewStory?storyId=1098 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-05-25 |title=The Curse of Nakedness |publisher=Imow.org |date= |accessdate=2012-08-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nigeria, during mass protests against the [[petroleum industry]], women displayed themselves in [[anasyrma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Geraldine Sealey |url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=79895 |title=Naked Ploy Is Latest Threat in Oil Wars |publisher=ABC News |date=2002-07-31 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leymah Gbowee]] used anasyrma when trying to bring peace during the [[Second Liberian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |author=Kevin Conley |url=http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Leymah-Gbowee-and-Abigail-Disney-Shoot-for-Peace-in-Liberia/5 |title=The Rabble Rousers |magazine=O, The Oprah Magazine |date=December 2008 |accessdate=2012-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Batrachology''' is the branch of [[zoology]] concerned with the study of [[amphibian]]s including [[frog]]s and [[toad]]s, [[salamander]]s, [[newt]]s, and [[caecilian]]s. It is a sub-discipline of [[herpetology]], which includes also non-avian [[Reptile|reptiles]] ([[snake]]s, [[lizard]]s, [[amphisbaenia|amphisbaenids]], [[turtle]]s, [[terrapin]]s, [[tortoise]]s, [[crocodilia|crocodilians]], and the [[tuatara]]). '''Batrachologists''' may study the [[evolution]], [[ecology]], [[ethology]], or [[anatomy]] of amphibians.

Amphibians are [[Ectotherm|cold blooded]] vertebrates largely found in damp habitats although many species have special behavioural adaptations that allow them to live in deserts, trees, underground and in regions with wide seasonal variations in temperature. There are over 7250 [[species]] of amphibians.&lt;ref name="AmphibiaWeb"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amphibiaweb.org/ |title=AmphibiaWeb |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=2014-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biophysical  environment''' is a [[life|biotic]] and [[Abiotic component|abiotic]] surrounding of an [[organism]] or [[population]], and consequently includes the factors that have an influence in their survival, development, and evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Biology online| title=''Environment. Definition''| url=http://www.biology-online.org/dictionary/Environment| accessdate=2012-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A biophysical environment can vary in scale from [[microscopic]] to global in extent. It can also be subdivided according to its attributes. Examples include the [[marine environment]], the [[atmospheric environment]] and the [[Ecoregion#Terrestrial|terrestrial environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The term ''[[:wikt:environment|environment]]'' can refer to a singular global environment in relation to [[human]]ity, or a local biophysical environment, e.g. the UK's [[Environment Agency]].

==Life-environment interaction==
All life that has survived must have adapted to conditions of its environment. Temperature, light, humidity, soil nutrients, etc., all influence any species, within any environment. However life in turn modifies, in various forms, its conditions. Some long term modifications along the history of our planet have been significant, such as the incorporation of [[oxygen]] to the [[atmosphere of Earth|atmosphere]]. This process consisted in the breakdown of [[carbon dioxide]] by [[anaerobic microorganism]]s that used the carbon in their [[metabolism]] and released the [[Atmospheric chemistry|oxygen to the atmosphere]]. This led to the existence of oxygen-based plant and animal life, the [[great oxygenation event]]. Other interactions are more immediate and simple, such as the smoothing effect that forests have on the temperature cycle, compared to neighboring unforested areas.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

[[Environmental science]] is the study of the interactions within the biophysical environment. Part of this [[Branches of science|scientific discipline]] is the investigation of the [[effect of human activity on the environment]]. [[Ecology]], a sub-discipline of biology and a part of environmental sciences, is often mistaken as a study of human induced effects on the environment. [[Environmental studies]] is a broader [[academic discipline]] that is the systematic study of interaction of humans with their environment. It is a broad field of study that includes the [[natural environment]], [[built environment]]s and [[social environment]]s.

Environmentalism is a broad social and philosophical movement that, in a large part, seeks to minimise and compensate the negative effect of human activity on the biophysical environment. The issues of concern for environmentalists usually relate to the natural environment with the more important ones being [[climate change]], [[species]] [[extinction]], [[pollution]], and [[old growth forest]] loss.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5227">In [[theoretical computer science]], a '''circuit''' is a [[model of computation]] in which input values proceed through a sequence of gates, each of which computes a [[function (computer science)|function]]. Circuits of this kind provide a generalization of [[Boolean circuit]]s and a mathematical model for [[digital logic]] circuits. Circuits are defined by the gates they contain and the values the gates can produce.  For example, the values in a Boolean circuit are [[Boolean data type|boolean]] values, and the circuit includes [[logical conjunction|conjunction]], [[logical disjunction|disjunction]], and [[logical negation|negation]] gates.  The values in an [[integer circuit]] are [[set (mathematics)|set]]s of [[integer]]s and the gates compute [[set union]], [[set intersection]], and [[set complement]], as well as the [[arithmetic operation]]s [[addition]] and [[multiplication]].

== Formal definition ==
A circuit is a triple &lt;math&gt;(M, L, G)&lt;/math&gt;, where
* &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; is a set of values,
* &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a set of gate labels, each of which is a function from &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; for some non-negative integer &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; represents the number of inputs to the gate), and
* &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a [[labelled graph|labelled]] [[directed acyclic graph]] with labels from &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;.

The vertices of the graph are called ''gates''. For each gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; of [[in-degree]] &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, the gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; can be labeled by an element &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; is defined on &lt;math&gt;M^{i}&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Terminology ===
The gates of in-degree 0 are called ''inputs'' or ''leaves''. The gates of out-degree 0 are called ''outputs''. If there is an edge from gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to gate &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; in the graph &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''child'' of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. We suppose there is an order on the vertices of the graph, so we can speak of the &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;th child of a gate when &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is less than the out-degree of the gate.

The ''size'' of a circuit is the number of nodes of a circuit. The ''depth of a gate'' &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the length of the [[longest path]] in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; beginning at &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; up to an output gate. In particular, the gates of out-degree 0 are the only gates of depth 1. The ''depth of a circuit'' is the maximum depth of any gate. 

''Level &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;'' is the set of all gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;. A ''levelled circuit'' is a circuit in which the edges to gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; comes only from gates of depth &lt;math&gt;i + 1&lt;/math&gt; or from the inputs. In other words, edges only exist between adjacent levels of the circuit. The ''width'' of a levelled circuit is the maximum size of any level.

=== Evaluation ===
The exact value &lt;math&gt;V(g)&lt;/math&gt; of a gate &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; with in-degree &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; and label &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; is defined recursively for all gates &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.
:&lt;math&gt;
V(g) = 
\begin{cases}
  l &amp; \text{if } g \text{ is an input} \\
  l(V(g_1), \dotsc, V(g_i)) &amp; \text{otherwise,}
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
where each &lt;math&gt;g_j&lt;/math&gt; is a parent of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;.

The value of the circuit is the value of each of the output gates.

== Circuits as functions ==
The labels of the leaves can also be variables which take values in &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. If there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; leaves, then the circuit can be seen as a function from  &lt;math&gt;M^{n}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;. It is then usual to consider a family of circuits &lt;math&gt;(C_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;, a sequence of circuits indexed by the integers where the circuit &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; variables. Families of circuits can thus be seen as functions from &lt;math&gt;M^{*}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt;.

The notions of size, depth and width can be naturally extended to families of functions, becoming functions from &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;; for example, &lt;math&gt;size(n)&lt;/math&gt; is the size of the  &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;th circuit of the family. 

== Complexity and algorithmic problems ==

Computing the output of a given [[Boolean circuit]] on a specific input is [[P-complete]] problem. If the input is an [[integer circuit]], however, it is unknown whether this problem is [[decidable language|decidable]].

[[Circuit complexity]] attempts to classify [[Boolean function]]s with respect to the size or depth of circuits that can compute them.

The '''conservation and restoration of flags and banners''' is the process by which conservators work to [[Preservation (library and archival science)|preserve]] and restore flags and banners from future deterioration and damage. As a part of [[Conservation and restoration of textiles|Conservation of Textiles]], flag and banner conservation require the care of a skilled and well trained textile conservator, specifically trained in historical materials.

==Material identification==
Historical Flags are often made of [[silk]], [[cotton]], [[linen]], or thin [[wool]] bunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials were used in the making of flags, primarily in the U.S. until the mid 20th century. Forensic examination of flags, to the level of examining the fibers of the fabrics themselves, and the threads used to sew the flags, helps identify the period of the materials used and usually is a good indicator of the period of a flag (though not necessarily, in the case of a forgery).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural Protein Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/77/natural-protein-fibers|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These materials can be very fragile and require advanced conservation techniques. Conservators are experts in stabilization and preservation of historic fabrics, flags may be in a variety of conditions from good condition to tattered fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silk and wool are protein fibers whereas cotton and linen are vegetable fibers. The process by which they deteriorate will vary greatly and needs to be carefully addressed during conservation and preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellulosic Fibers|url=http://www.textileschool.com/articles/70/natural-cellulose-fibres-natures-own-fibres|website=The Textile School|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nowadays many flags are made of a synthetic blend or [[nylon]] materials, which have their own unique requirements for preservation and care.

== Common causes of damage ==
Flag condition often relates to their usage during the war, so some of the most historically significant examples show the greatest damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wisconsin's Civil War Battle Flags: From the Collections of the Wisconsin Veteran's Museum|url=http://www.wisconsinbattleflags.com/conservation/|website=Wisconsin Battle Flags.com|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, flags were not limited to damage from war, such as bullet holes or blood stains - which have specific treatments themselves - but also damage from natural elements such as wind, light exposure, temperature, humidity and pest infestation.
*[[Wind]] damage: The mechanical action of wind forces and exposure to environmental effects can cause damage to the filament and is characterized by splitting. Visual characteristics of wind damage include fraying and even shredding in high winds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hearle|first1=JWS|last2=Lomas|first2=B.|last3=Cooke|first3=W.D.|title=Atlas of Fibre Fracture and Damage to Textiles|date=1998|publisher=Elsevier|page=360|accessdate=29 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*
*[[Light]] Exposure: Too much light speeds deterioration of textiles. Historic textiles, such as flags and banners should be protected from excessive light levels, and especially from sunlight and fluorescent light, which contain high amounts of ultraviolet radiation - which is the most harmful form of light. Signs of Light damage can include a brittleness of the material, overall color change of the fabric or yellowing/ browning of the textile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conservation Concerns|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=85}}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*
*[[Temperature]] and [[Humidity]] Fluctuations: Both mechanisms of decay for objects can be attributed to either too low or too high of a temperature, too high of humidity, or too much fluctuation between temperatures or humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=378|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pest (organism)|Pests]]: There are many types of pests, from [[insects]] to small [[mammals]] such as [[rodents]] that can infest an organic collection of all types. In particular, these pests can colonize textiles and cause irreparable damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9780838911228|page=376|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of the types of pests that can afflict historical flags and banners include cloth [[moths]] and [[carpet beetles]]. It is important to be vigilant of possible signs of infestation and to take preemptive measures to ensure infestation and damage does not occur. Professionals charged with the care and preservation of collections work to develop and enforce Integrated Pest Management plans (IPM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Museum Registration Methods|date=2010|publisher=The AAM Press|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-8389-1122-8|page=297|edition=fifth}}&lt;!--|accessdate=28 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; to ensure proper steps are taken to protect historic items such as flags and banners.

== Common treatments and handling ==
* Cleaning- While many people have experience cleaning everyday textiles, cleaning historical textiles is different. Conservators approach cleaning historic textiles like flags and banner very carefully as each cleaning process can create a little damage. They must weigh the pros and cons of each method carefully before proceeding. Damage such as dyes bleeding, seams shrinking or finishes being lost can occur in the cleaning process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Vacuuming - also referred to as surface cleaning. This method is employed by conservators when trying to remove surface dirt. Carefully vacuuming the textile on a low suction, conservators will sometimes used a screen to prevent individual fibers from getting sucked up and lost in the vacuum. This method is considered least invasive and often very successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Wet cleaning- or washing is a more invasive cleaning method, and one that conservators may be hesitant to use without proper review of the textile. Wet cleaning, or washing is an irreversible process, and can cause significant damage. In particular, commercial detergents and other chemicals can increase the rate of deterioration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pest Control-Prevention is better than cure. In order to develop and implement an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy it is important understand and recognize some of the key components of successful pest control. 
#Avoid pests- Keep the area clean a clear of clutter and inspect often.
#Prevent pest colonization- follow routine pest management.

If pest infestation occurs it is important to act fast by following the IPM plan and consulting a trusted pest control professional. If individual pieces are attacked it is important to isolate them immediately in a plastic bag or sealed between to sheets of plastic and tape and then proceed with the IPM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landry|first1=Gregory|last2=et.al.|title=The Winterthur Guide to Caring for Your Collection|date=2000|publisher=Library of Congress Cataloging in Publication Data|location=Singapore|isbn=9780912724522|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Recognize pests- what kind of infestation do you have?
#Assess the pest problem- how pervasive is the problem?
#Solve the pest problem- follow the IPM and consult a pest control professional
#Review IMP procedure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Flags and Banners|url=http://www.museumtextiles.com/flags-and-banners.html|website=Museum Textile Services., LLC.|accessdate=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage ==
It is important to consider proper textile storage in the design plan of your storage facility. This room should have limited access, in the interior of the building, with no exposure to outside light, temperature controlled, and properly installed monitoring equipment. Like other organic materials, textiles can deteriorate very quickly under fluctuating temperatures and humidity levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Smithsonian Books|isbn=978-1-56098-174-9|pages=69–96}}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 April 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Flags and banner are no exception to this so proper storage is critical in preservation.
* Flat Storage-Flat storage mats are constructed of corrugated cardboard with a window opening that should be slightly large than the textile object. Textiles should be wrapped in neutral pH tissue. This flat mats can then be stored in flat acid free boxes.
* Rolled Storage- Flat textiles that are in good condition and in good strength can be rolled up and stored in tubes. The length of the textile tube is determined by the width of the textile. Textiles should be inter-leafed by neutral pH tissue paper and the textile secured in the tube. Textile tubes should then be stored in flat boxes made of acid free corrugated cardboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bachmann|first1=Konstanze|title=Conservation Concerns|date=1992|publisher=Cooper Hewitt- Smithsonian|location=Washington, DC|isbn=9781560981749|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mounted Storage- historic flags and banners are also mounted for display and storage. It is important to keep in mind the condition of the flag prior to placing it in mounted storage.

'''Creolistics''', or '''Creology''', is the [[scientific]] study of [[creole language]]s and, as such, is a subfield of [[linguistics]]. Someone who engages in this study is called a '''creolist'''.

==Controversy==
Creolistics investigates the relative creoleness of languages suspected to be [[creole (language)|creole]]s, what {{Harvcoltxt|Schneider|1990}} calls "the [[cline (linguistics)|cline]] of creoleness."  No consensus exists among creolists as to whether the nature of creoleness is [[prototypical]] or merely evidence indicative of a set of recognizable phenomena seen in association with little inherent unity and no underlying single cause.

==="Creole", a sociohistoric concept===
''Creoleness'' is at the heart of the controversy with [[John McWhorter]]&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Mikael Parkvall{{sfnp|Parkvall|2001}} opposing [[Henri Wittmann]] (1999) and [[Michel DeGraff]].&lt;ref&gt;As in {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2003}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Degraff|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In McWhorter's definition, creoleness is a matter of degree, in that prototypical creoles exhibit all of the three traits he proposes to diagnose creoleness: little or no [[inflection]], little or no [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]], [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]]; In McWhorter's view, less prototypical creoles depart somewhat from this [[prototype]]. Along these lines, McWhorter defines [[Haitian Creole]], exhibiting all three traits, as "the most creole of creoles."{{sfnp|McWhorter|1998|p=809}} A creole like [[Palenquero]], on the other hand, would be less prototypical, given the presence of inflection to mark plural, past, gerund, and participle forms.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2000}} Objections to the McWhorter-Parkvall hypotheses point out that these typological [[parameters]] of creoleness can be found in languages such as [[Manding languages|Manding]], [[Soninke language|Sooninke]], and [[Magoua]] [[French language|French]] which are not considered creoles. Wittmann and DeGraff come to the conclusion that efforts to conceive a [[yardstick]] for measuring [[creoleness]] in any scientifically meaningful way have failed so far.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1999}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2003}} {{Harvcoltxt|Gil|2001}} comes to the same conclusion for [[Riau]] [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]]. {{Harvcoltxt|Muysken|Law|2001}} have adduced evidence as to creole languages which respond unexpectedly to one of McWhorter's three features (for example, [[inflectional morphology]] in [[Berbice Dutch Creole]], [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]] in [[Papiamentu]]). {{Harvcoltxt|Mufwene|2000}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|2001}} have argued further that Creole languages are structurally no different from any other language, and that Creole is in fact a sociohistoric concept (and not a linguistic one), encompassing displaced population and slavery. {{Harvcoltxt|DeGraff|Walicek|2005}} discuss creolistics in relation to [[colonialism|colonialist]] ideologies, rejecting the notion that Creoles can be responsibly defined in terms of specific grammatical characteristics. They discuss the history of linguistics and nineteenth-century work that argues for the consideration of the sociohistorical contexts in which Creole languages emerged.

==="Creole", a genuine linguistic concept===
On the other hand, McWhorter points out that in languages such as Bambara, essentially a dialect of Manding, there is ample non-transparent derivation, and that there is no reason to suppose that this would be absent in close relatives such as Mandinka itself.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|p=16}} Moreover, he also observes that Soninke has what all linguists would analyze as inflections, and that current lexicography of Soninke is too elementary for it to be stated with authority that it does not have non-transparent derivation.{{sfnp|McWhorter|2005|pp=35, 369}} Meanwhile, Magoua French, as described by Henri Wittmann, retains some indication of grammatical gender, which qualifies as inflection, and it also retains non-transparent derivation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1996}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Wittmann|1998}} as interpreted by {{Harvcoltxt|Parkvall|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Michel DeGraff's argument has been that Haitian Creole retains non-transparent derivation from French.

To the defense of DeGraff and Wittmann it must be said that McWhorter's 2005 book is a collection of previously published papers and that it contains nothing on "defining creole", Manding, Sooninke or Magoua that wasn't already known when DeGraff and Wittmann published their critiques as can be seen from their published debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133249/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R6278&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133212/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R12834&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133219/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R14907&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133224/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R20843&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133229/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9908&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R21590&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} [http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081008133259/http://listserv.linguistlist.org/cgi-bin/wa?A2=ind9909&amp;L=CREOLIST&amp;P=R4629&amp;D=0&amp;I=-3 |date=2008-10-08 }} Also see the list at the end of [http://www.nou-la.org/ling/1999a-prototype.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As it is, McWhorter's book does not offer anything new by the way of analysis of Manding, Soninke, or Magoua that wasn't already debated on in his exchange with Wittmann on Creolist. The issues in question are, at this point, unresolved as to sustaining McWhorter's hypotheses in any significant way though DeGraff's 2005 contribution addresses their weaknesses as far as Haitian Creole is concerned adding new evidence against. The only conclusion possibly so far as the typological differences between Manding, Soninke, Magoua and Haitian are concerned is that their comparative data do not confirm McWhorter's yardstick approach to defining creole.

===Proposed synthesis===
The answer might be that creoleness is better described and referred to as a syndrome. In some cases, the modified source language might be the [[substratum|substrate]] language when warranted by a [[homogeneous]] substrate.{{sfnp|Singler|1988}} In other cases, the modified source language clearly is what [[creolist]]s identify as the [[superstrate]] language'{{sfnp|Wittmann|2001}} and in still other cases, no single source language might be identifiable.{{sfnp|DeGraff|2001}}  The same approach must be applied to identifying individual features as inherited or non-inherited and to distilling the defining grounds which separate creole languages from [[mixed language]]s such as [[Michif]], especially when [[relexification]] is somehow claimed to be a moving factor.{{sfnp|Wittmann|1973}}{{sfnp|Singler|1996}}{{sfnp|Wittmann|Fournier|1996}}{{sfnp|DeGraff|2002}}

The answer might also be, however, that creole languages (i.e. like Haitian Creole) are indeed a unique in terms of the perspective that they offer on the human language competence in terms of the nature of their grammars though there have been no new responses to the counter-claims of DeGraff and Wittmann that would warrant the reopening of the debate as for now. However, {{Harvcoltxt|Ansaldo|Matthews|Lim|2007}} critically assesses the proposal that creole languages exist as a homogeneous structural type with shared and/ or peculiar origins.

Though the call for a sane approach to creolistics goes back to {{Harvcoltxt|Givón|1979}}, the first unbiased overview of the scientifically meaningful characteristics of creole languages must go to the credit of {{Harvcoltxt|Arends|Muysken|Smith|1995}}. In their account of approaches to creole genesis, they group theories into four categories:

:* ''Theories focusing on the [[Europe]]an input''
:* ''Theories focusing on the non-European input''
:* ''[[Gradualist]] and [[Developmental linguistics|developmental]] hypotheses''
:* ''[[Universalist]] approaches''

The authors also confine [[Pidgins]] and [[mixed languages]] into separate chapters outside this scheme whether or not relexification come into the picture.

The language specified by a k-length decision list includes as a subset the language specified by a k-depth [[decision tree]].

Learning decision lists can be used for [[attribute efficient learning]].&lt;ref&gt;Adam R. Klivans and Rocco A. Servedio, "Toward Attribute Efficient Learning of Decision Lists and Parities", ''Journal of Machine Learning Research'' '''7''':12:587-602 [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1248567&amp;dl=ACM&amp;coll=DL&amp;CFID=344844478&amp;CFTOKEN=13074001 ACM Digital Library] [http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume7/klivans06a/klivans06a.pdf full text]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Definition ==

A decision list (DL) of length {{mvar|r}} is of the form:

 '''if''' {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} '''then''' 
   output {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}
 '''else if''' {{math|''f''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} '''then'''
   output {{math|''b''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}
 ...
 '''else if''' {{mvar|f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} '''then'''
   output {{mvar|b&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}}

where {{mvar|f&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the {{mvar|i}}th formula and {{mvar|b&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the {{mvar|i}}th [[Boolean data type|boolean]] for &lt;math&gt;i \in \{1...r\}&lt;/math&gt;.  The last if-then-else is the default case, which means formula {{mvar|f&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;}} is always equal to true. A {{mvar|k}}-DL is a decision list where all of formulas have at most {{mvar|k}} terms.  Sometimes "decision list" is used to refer to a 1-DL, where all of the formulas are either a variable or its [[negation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">The '''Dundee Society''' was a society of graduates of CA-400, a [[National Security Agency]] course in [[cryptology]] devised by [[Lambros D. Callimahos]], which included the [[Zendian Problem]] (a practical exercise in [[traffic analysis]] and [[cryptanalysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Callimahos, Lambros D. | title=Traffic Analysis and the Zendian Problem |publisher=Aegean Park Press | isbn=0-89412-161-8 | year=1989 | location=Walnut Creek, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The class was held once a year, and new members were inducted into the Society upon completion of the class.  The Society was founded in the mid-1950s and continued on after Callimahos' retirement from NSA in 1976.  The last CA-400 class was held at NSA in 1979, formally closing the society's membership rolls.&lt;ref name="DundeeSociety"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/crypto_almanac_50th/Lambros_D._Callimahos_Part_2_djpaul.pdf|title=Cryptologic Almanac 50th Anniversary Series, Lambros D.

The society took its name from an empty jar of [[Dundee Marmalade]] that Callimahos kept on his desk for use as a pencil caddy.  Callimahos came up with the society's name while trying to schedule a luncheon for former CA-400 students at the [[Fort George G. Meade|Ft. Meade]] Officers' Club; being unable to use either the course name or the [[No such agency|underlying government agency's name]] for security reasons, he spotted the ceramic Dundee jar and decided to use "The Dundee Society" as the cover name for the luncheon reservation.&lt;ref name="DundeeSociety" /&gt;  CA-400 students were presented with ceramic [[Marmalade#Dundee Marmalade|Dundee Marmalade]] jars at the close of the course as part of the induction ceremony into the Dundee Society. When Dundee switched from ceramic to glass jars, Callimahos would still present graduates with ceramic Dundee jars, but the jars were then collected back up for use in next year's induction ceremony, and members were "encouraged" to seek out Dundee jars for their own collections if they wished to have a permanent token of induction.&lt;ref name="DundeeSociety" /&gt;

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14617">'''Effective dose''' is a dose quantity in the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) system of [[radiation protection|radiological protection]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication, 103 para 103&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the tissue-weighted sum of the [[equivalent dose]]s in all specified tissues and organs of the human body and represents the [[stochastic]] health risk to the whole body, which is the ''probability'' of [[Radiation-induced cancer|cancer induction]] and genetic effects, of low levels of [[ionising radiation]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, glossary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt; It takes into account the type of radiation and the nature of each organ or tissue being irradiated, and enables summation of organ doses due to varying levels and types of radiation, both internal and external, to produce an overall calculated effective dose.

The SI unit for effective dose is the [[sievert]] (Sv) which represents a 5.5% chance of developing cancer.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103&lt;/ref&gt; The effective dose is not intended as a measure of ''deterministic'' health effects, which is the ''severity'' of acute tissue damage that is certain to happen, that is measured by the quantity [[absorbed dose]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP report 103 para 104 and 105&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of effective dose was developed by Wolfgang Jacobi and published in 1975, and was so convincing that the ICRP incorporated it into their 1977 general recommendations (publication 26) as "effective dose equivalent".&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; The name "effective dose" replaced the name "effective dose equivalent" in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 executive summary para 101&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1977 it has been the central quantity for dose limitation in the ICRP international system of [[radiation protection|radiological protection]].&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication, 103 para 103&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
[[File:Dose quantities and units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry]]
According to the ICRP, the main uses of effective dose are the prospective dose assessment for planning and optimisation in radiological protection, and demonstration of compliance with dose limits for regulatory purposes. The effective dose is thus a central dose quantity for regulatory purposes.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 executive summary para j&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP also says that effective dose has made a significant contribution to radiological protection as it has enabled doses to be summed from whole and partial body exposure from external radiation of various types and from intakes of radionuclides.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 para 101&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage for external dose===
The calculation of effective dose is required for partial or non-uniform irradiation of the human body because [[equivalent dose]] does not consider the tissue irradiated, but only the radiation type. Various body tissues react to ionising radiation in different ways, so the ICRP has assigned sensitivity factors to specified tissues and organs so that the effect of partial irradiation can be calculated if the irradiated regions are known.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103, para 22 &amp; glossary&lt;/ref&gt;  A radiation field irradiating only a portion of the body will carry lower risk than if the same field irradiated the whole body. To take this into account, the effective doses to the component parts of the body which have been irradiated are calculated and summed. This becomes the effective dose for the whole body, dose quantity ''E''. It is a "protection" dose quantity which can be calculated, but cannot be measured in practice.

An effective dose will carry the same effective risk to the whole body regardless of where it was applied, and it will carry the same effective risk as the same amount of equivalent dose applied uniformly to the whole body.

===Usage for internal dose===
Effective dose can be calculated for [[committed dose]] which is the internal dose resulting from inhaling, ingesting, or injecting radioactive materials. 

The dose quantity used is:

'''Committed effective dose,''' E(''t'') is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t'' is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of effective dose==
[[File:SI Radiation dose units.png|thumb|400px|Graphic showing relationships of protection dose quantities in [[SI]] units]]
Ionizing radiation deposits energy in the matter being irradiated. The quantity used to express this is the [[absorbed dose]], a physical dose quantity that is dependent on the level of incident radiation and the absorption properties of the irradiated object. Absorbed dose is a physical quantity, and is not a satisfactory indicator of biological effect, so to allow consideration of the stochastic radiological risk, the dose quantities equivalent dose and effective dose were devised by the [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU) and the ICRP to calculate the biological effect of an absorbed dose.

To obtain an effective dose, the calculated absorbed organ dose ''D''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; is first corrected for the radiation type using factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; to give a weighted average of the equivalent dose quantity ''H''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; received in irradiated body tissues, and the result is further corrected for the tissues or organs being irradiated using factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, to produce the effective dose quantity ''E''.

The sum of effective doses to all organs and tissues of the body represents the effective dose for the whole body. If only part of the body is irradiated, then only those regions are used to calculate the effective dose. The tissue weighting factors summate to 1.0, so that if an entire body is radiated with uniformly penetrating external radiation, the effective dose for the entire body is equal to the equivalent dose for the entire body.

===Use of tissue weighting factor ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;===
The ICRP tissue weighting factors are given in the accompanying table, and the equations used to calculate from either absorbed dose or equivalent dose are also given.

Some tissues like bone marrow are particularly sensitive to radiation, so they are given a weighting factor that is disproportionally large relative to the fraction of body mass they represent. Other tissues like the hard bone surface are particularly insensitive to radiation and are assigned a disproportionally low weighting factor.

Calculating from the equivalent dose:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_T W_T \cdot H_T = \sum_T W_T \sum_R W_R \cdot \bar{D}_{T,R}&lt;/math&gt;.

Calculating from the absorbed dose:

:&lt;math&gt;E = \sum_T W_T \sum_R W_R \cdot \frac{\int_{T}D_R (x,y,z)\rho(x,y,z)dV}{\int_{T}\rho(x,y,z)dV}&lt;/math&gt;

Where

:&lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt;  is the effective dose to the entire organism
:&lt;math&gt;H_T&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalent dose absorbed by tissue T
:&lt;math&gt;W_T&lt;/math&gt; is the tissue weighting factor defined by regulation
:&lt;math&gt;W_R&lt;/math&gt; is the radiation weighting factor defined by regulation
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{D}_{T,R}&lt;/math&gt; is the mass-averaged absorbed dose in tissue T by radiation type R
:&lt;math&gt;D_R (x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the absorbed dose from radiation type R as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the density as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;  is volume
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;  is the tissue or organ of interest

The ICRP tissue weighting factors are chosen to represent the fraction of health risk, or biological effect, which is attributable to the specific tissue named. These weighting factors have been revised twice, as shown in the chart above.

The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] still endorses the ICRP's 1977 tissue weighting factors in their regulations, in spite of the ICRP's later revised recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=10 CFR 20.1003|year=2009|publisher=US Nuclear Regulatory Commission|url=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part020/part020-1003.html|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health effects==
{{Main|Radiobiology}}
Ionizing radiation is generally harmful and potentially lethal to living things but can have health benefits in [[radiation therapy]] for the treatment of cancer and [[thyrotoxicosis]]. Its most common impact is the [[radiation-induced cancer|induction of cancer]] with a [[Incubation period|latent period]] of years or decades after exposure. High doses can cause visually dramatic [[radiation burns]], and/or rapid fatality through [[acute radiation syndrome]]. Controlled doses are used for [[medical imaging]] and [[radiotherapy]]. 

==Regulatory nomenclature==
===UK regulations===
The UK [[Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999]] defines its usage of the term effective dose; "Any reference to an effective dose means the sum of the effective dose to the whole body from external radiation and the committed effective dose from internal radiation."&lt;ref&gt;The UK Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 &lt;/ref&gt;

===US effective dose equivalent===
The US [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] has retained in the US regulation system the older term '''effective dose equivalent''' to refer to a similar quantity to the ICRP effective dose. The NRC's [[total effective dose equivalent]] (TEDE) is the sum of external effective dose with internal committed dose; in other words all sources of dose.

In the US, cumulative equivalent dose due to external whole-body exposure is normally reported to nuclear energy workers in regular dosimetry reports.

* [[deep-dose equivalent]], (DDE) which is properly a whole-body equivalent dose
* '''shallow dose equivalent''', (SDE) which is actually the effective dose to the skin

==History==
The concept of effective dose was introduced in 1975 by Wolfgang Jacobi (1928–2015) in his publication "The concept of an effective dose: a proposal for the combination of organ doses".&lt;ref name="obituary"&gt;Journal of Radiological protection Vol.35 No.3 2015. "Obituary - Wolfgang Jacobi 1928 - 2015."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jacobi W|title=The concept of effective dose - A proposal for the combination of organ doses|journal=Radiat. Environ. Biophys|year=1975|issue=12|pages=101–109}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was quickly included in 1977 as “effective dose equivalent” into Publication 26 by the ICRP. In 1991, ICRP publication 60 shortened the name to "effective dose."&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 paragraph 101&lt;/ref&gt; This quantity is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the "dose equivalent" because of the earlier name, and that misnomer in turn causes confusion with [[equivalent dose]]. The tissue weighting factors were revised in 1990 and 2007 due to new data.

==Future use of Effective Dose==
At the ICRP 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection in October 2015, ICRP Task Group 79 reported on the "Use of Effective Dose as a Risk-related Radiological Protection Quantity".

This included a proposal to discontinue use of equivalent dose as a separate protection quantity. This would avoid confusion between equivalent dose, effective dose and dose equivalent, and to use absorbed dose in Gy as a more appropriate quantity for limiting deterministic effects to the eye lens, skin, hands &amp; feet.&lt;ref&gt;"Use of Effective Dose", John Harrison. 3rd International Symposium on the System of Radiological Protection, October 2015, Seoul.  &lt;/ref&gt;

It was also proposed that effective dose could be used as a rough indicator of possible risk from medical examinations. These proposals will need to go through the following stages:

* Discussion within ICRP Committees
* Revision of report by Task Group
* Reconsideration by Committees and Main Commission
* Public Consultation

[[File:Ekman layer.jpg|thumb|350px|Ekman Transport is the net motion of fluid as the result of a balance between [[Coriolis effect|Coriolis]] and turbulent drag forces. In the picture above, the wind blowing North creates a surface stress and a resulting [[Ekman spiral]] is found below it in the [[water column]].]]

'''Ekman transport''', part of Ekman motion theory first investigated in 1902 by [[Vagn Walfrid Ekman]], refers to the wind-driven net transport of the surface layer of a fluid that, due to the [[Coriolis effect]], occurs at 90° to the direction of the surface wind. This phenomenon was first noted by [[Fridtjof Nansen]], who recorded that ice transport appeared to occur at an angle to the wind direction during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|Arctic expedition]] during the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard, p 101&lt;/ref&gt; The direction of transport is dependent on the hemisphere: in the [[Northern Hemisphere|northern hemisphere]], transport occurs at 90° clockwise from wind direction, while in the [[Southern Hemisphere|southern hemisphere]] it occurs at a 90° counterclockwise.&lt;ref name=Colling42-44&gt;Colling, pp 42-44&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Ekman theory explains the theoretical state of circulation if water currents were driven only by the transfer of momentum from the wind. In the physical world, this is difficult to observe because of the influences of many simultaneous [[Ocean current|current]] driving forces (for example, [[pressure]] and [[density gradient]]s). Though the following theory technically applies to the idealized situation involving only wind forces, Ekman motion describes the wind-driven portion of circulation seen in the surface layer.&lt;ref&gt;Colling p 44&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sverdrup p 228&lt;/ref&gt;

Surface currents flow at a 45° angle to the wind due to a balance between the Coriolis force and the [[Drag (physics)|drags]] generated by the wind and the water.&lt;ref&gt;Mann &amp; Lazier p 169&lt;/ref&gt; If the ocean is divided vertically into thin layers, the magnitude of the velocity (the speed) decreases from a maximum at the surface until it dissipates. The direction also shifts slightly across each subsequent layer (right in the northern hemisphere and left in the southern hemisphere). This is called the [[Ekman Spiral|Ekman spiral]].&lt;ref&gt;Knauss p 124.&lt;/ref&gt; The layer of water from the surface to the point of dissipation of this spiral is known as the [[Ekman layer]]. If all flow over the Ekman layer is integrated, the net transportation is at 90° to the right (left) of the surface wind in the northern (southern) hemisphere.&lt;ref name=Colling42-44/&gt;

==Mathematical derivation==
Some assumptions of the fluid dynamics involved in the process must be made in order to simplify the process to a point where it is solvable. The assumptions made by Ekman were:&lt;ref&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;
* no boundaries;
* infinitely deep water;
* [[Viscosity#Eddy viscosity|eddy viscosity]], &lt;math&gt;A_z\,\!&lt;/math&gt;, is constant (this is only true for laminar flow. In the turbulent atmospheric and oceanic boundary layer it is a strong function of depth);
* the wind forcing is steady and has been blowing for a long time;
* [[barotropic]] conditions with no geostrophic flow;
* the Coriolis parameter, &lt;math&gt; f\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is kept constant.

The simplified equations for the Coriolis force in the ''x'' and ''y'' directions follow from these assumptions:

:{{EquationRef|1|(1)}}{{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \tau_x}{\partial z} = -fv,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:{{EquationRef|2|(2)}}{{pad|2em}} &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial \tau_y}{\partial z} = fu,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\tau\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the wind stress, &lt;math&gt;\rho\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the density, &lt;math&gt;u\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the East-West velocity, and &lt;math&gt;v\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the north-south velocity.

Integrating each equation over the entire Ekman layer:

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_x=-M_yf,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\tau_y=M_xf,\,&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;M_x=\int^z_0 \rho u dz,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_y=\int^z_0 \rho v dz.\,&lt;/math&gt;

Here &lt;math&gt;M_x\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;M_y\,\!&lt;/math&gt; represent the zonal and meridional mass transport terms with units of mass per unit time per unit length. Contrarily to common logic, north-south winds cause mass transport in the East-West direction.&lt;ref&gt;Knauss p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to understand the vertical velocity structure of the water column, equations {{EquationNote|1}} and {{EquationNote|2}} can be rewritten in terms of the vertical eddy viscosity term.

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \tau_x}{\partial z} = \rho A_z \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \tau_y}{\partial z} = \rho A_z \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial z^2},\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;A_z\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the vertical eddy viscosity coefficient.

This gives a set of differential equations of the form

:&lt;math&gt; A_z \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2}=-fv,\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; A_z \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial z^2}=fu.\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

In order to solve this system of two differential equations, two boundary conditions can be applied:
* &lt;math&gt;{(u,v) \to 0}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;{z \to \infin},&lt;/math&gt;
* friction is equal to wind stress at the free surface (&lt;math&gt; z=0 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;).

Things can be further simplified by considering wind blowing in the ''y''-direction only. This means is the results will be relative to a north-south wind (although these solutions could be produced relative to wind in any other direction):&lt;ref name=P&amp;P108&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard p.108&lt;/ref&gt;

:{{EquationRef|3|(3)}}{{pad|2em}}&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
u_E&amp;=\pm V_0 \cos\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right)\exp\left(\frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right),\\
v_E&amp;= V_0 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{4} + \frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right)\exp\left(\frac{\pi}{D_E}z\right),\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where
* &lt;math&gt; u_E\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; v_E\,\!&lt;/math&gt; represent Ekman transport in the ''u'' and ''v'' direction;
* in equation {{EquationNote|3}} the plus sign applies to the northern hemisphere and the minus sign to the southern hemisphere;
* &lt;math&gt;V_0= \frac{\sqrt{2}\pi\tau_{y\eta}}{D_E\rho|f|};\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\tau_{y\eta}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the wind stress on the sea surface;
* &lt;math&gt;D_E = \pi\left(\frac{2A_z}{|f|}\right)^{1/2}\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is the Ekman depth (depth of Ekman layer).

By solving this at ''z''=0, the surface current is found to be (as expected) 45 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere. This also gives the expected shape of the Ekman spiral, both in magnitude and direction.&lt;ref name=P&amp;P108/&gt; Integrating these equations over the Ekman layer shows that the net Ekman transport term is 90 degrees to the right (left) of the wind in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere.

==Applications==
* Ekman transport leads to [[Upwelling#Coastal|coastal upwelling]], which provides the nutrient supply for some of the largest fishing markets on the planet&lt;ref name=Knauss125&gt;Knauss p 125&lt;/ref&gt; and can impact the stability of the [[Antarctic ice sheet|Antarctic Ice Sheet]] by pulling warm deep water onto the continental shelf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=R.

From Ekman transport, surface water has a net movement of 90° to right of wind direction in the northern hemisphere (left in the southern hemisphere). Because the surface water flows away from the coast, the water must be replaced with water from below.&lt;ref&gt;Mann &amp; Lazier p 172&lt;/ref&gt; In shallow coastal waters, the Ekman spiral is normally not fully formed and the wind events that cause upwelling episodes are typically rather short. This leads to many variations in the extent of upwelling, but the ideas are still generally applicable.&lt;ref&gt;Colling p 43&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ekman transport is similarly at work in [[Upwelling#Equatorial|equatorial upwelling]], where, in both hemispheres, a [[trade wind]] component towards the west causes a net transport of water towards the pole, and a trade wind component towards the east causes a net transport of water away from the pole.&lt;ref name=Knauss125/&gt;
* On smaller scales, [[Cyclone|cyclonic]] winds induce Ekman transport which causes net divergence and upwelling, or Ekman suction,&lt;ref name=Knauss125/&gt; while [[Anticyclone|anti-cyclonic]] winds cause net convergence and downwelling, or Ekman pumping&lt;ref name=P&amp;P295&gt;Pond &amp; Pickard p 295&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ekman transport is also a factor in the circulation of the [[ocean gyre]]s. Ekman transport causes water to flow toward the center of the gyre in all locations, creating a sloped sea-surface, and initiating [[Geostrophic wind#geostrophic flow|geostrophic flow]] (Colling p 65). [[Harald Sverdrup (oceanographer)|Harald Sverdrup]] applied Ekman transport while including pressure gradient forces to develop a theory for this (see [[Sverdrup balance]]).&lt;ref name=P&amp;P295/&gt; See: [[Garbage Patch (disambiguation)|Garbage Patch]]

The '''Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue''' ('''FIIRD''') was founded in 1999, sponsored by the [[Levant Foundation]] with the [[University of Geneva]] in Switzerland "to pursue its scholarly and humanistic goals with the main objective of fostering understanding of the three monotheistic religions: Christianity, Islam and Judaism."  The main program of the FIIRD is to enhance knowledge and the critical examination of the wellsprings of each religious tradition and then to acquire the linguistic and strategic tools needed to study the normative scriptures of these religions without syncretism or proselytism.

== Board of Trustees ==
The Board of Trustees currently includes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foundation for Interreligious and Intercultural Research and Dialogue|url=http://www.thelevantfoundation.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:fiird&amp;catid=7:continous&amp;Itemid=3|publisher=The Levant Foundation|accessdate=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects and Goals==
In 2006 the FIIRD published a boxed set of the three Holy Books, the Hebrew Bible, the New Testament and the Holy Qur'an.

Another goal of the FIIRD, strongly supported by the [[Levant Foundation]], was to create a post-doctoral program at the [[University of Geneva]] in the field of interreligious and intercultural dialogue whereby several Fellows, each possessing a PhD in theology, philosophy, history or other humanities and dedicated to further their knowledge and understanding of the monotheistic religions, participate in approved research and publish their results all done with the goal of searching for peace between the Abrahamistic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.

'''GNC Holdings Inc.''' (General Nutrition Centers) is a [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]-based American company selling health and nutrition related products, including [[vitamins]], [[Dietary supplement|supplements]], minerals, herbs, [[sports nutrition]], diet, and energy products.

==History==
[[File:GNCPromenade.JPG|thumb|A GNC store at [[The Promenade Shopping Centre|Promenade]]]]
In 1935, David Shakarian opened a small [[health food store]], Lackzoom, in downtown Pittsburgh.  He only made [[United States dollar|US$]]35 on his first day, but was able to open a second store within six months. A year later, Shakarian suffered from what appeared to be a fatal blow when the [[Ohio River]] [[Pittsburgh flood of 1936|flooded into downtown]] on [[St. Patrick's Day]]. Both of his stores were wiped out.  However, he quickly rebuilt both stores, and opened five more by 1941.  The company officially registered as a corporation on September 1, 1936 Shakarian moved into the mail order business during WWII. He said that customers sent him a check and asked him to mail their product as they could not drive to his store due to the gas rationing which happened during WWII.  During the [[health food]] craze of the 1960s, Shakarian expanded his chain outside Pittsburgh for the first time, and in the process changed its name to '''G'''eneral '''N'''utrition '''C'''enter.  He continued to run the chain until his death in 1984. Shakarian took GNC public (listed on the NYSE) in the 1980s.  Overexpansion and his death in 1984 resulted in a highly leveraged GNC.  The Shakarian family decided to sell GNC shortly after his death.  The family brought in a "turn around" executive, Jerry Horn, with instructions to "stop the bleeding" and position GNC to be sold.  

In 1990 the company considered relocating but a public/private effort retained GNC headquarters in [[Downtown Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last  = Daparma| first = Ron| author-link = | title = Robinson to retire as RIDC president| newspaper = Pittsburgh Tribune-Review| publication-place = Pittsburgh, PA| volume = | issue  = | date   = April 17, 2003| page   =| url    = http://triblive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/business/s_129671.html#axzz2jUu0Yoiq}}&lt;/ref&gt;  GNC was taken private and sold to The Thomas Lee Company, a PE investment/management fund in the late 1980s.  Thomas Lee ran GNC and took it public prior to selling the company to Royal Dutch Numico and [[Numico]] acquired GNC in 1999; it sold GNC to [[Apollo Management]] in 2003. [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]] and [[Ares Management]] bought GNC in 2007. GNC went public in 2011.

In 2018, Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co., a company controlled by the Chinese government, agreed to acquire an approximately 40% stake in GNC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-gnc-harbin-pharma-investment/chinas-harbin-pharma-to-buy-stake-in-u-s-health-retailer-gnc-idUSKCN1FY0DL |title=China's Harbin Pharma to buy stake in U.S. health retailer GNC |author=Kate Wu |publisher=Reuters |date=February 13, 2018 |accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retail stores==
[[Image:General Nutrition Centers Store.JPG|thumb|175px|left|GNC store, [[Ypsilanti Township, Michigan|Ypsilanti Twp., MI]]]]
GNC stores typically stock a wide range of [[weight loss]], [[bodybuilding supplement|bodybuilding]],  [[nutritional supplements]], [[vitamins]], natural remedies, and health and beauty products, in both its owned brands as well as third-party brands. The stores also sell health and fitness books and magazines.

GNC has more than 6,000 stores in the U.S., including 1,100 [[store-within-a-store]] locations within [[Rite Aid]], as well as locations in 49 other countries. In addition, GNC LiveWell currently has 41 Stores located in Brisbane, Sydney, and Melbourne in Australia.

==Business model==
GNC retail stores are a combination of corporate-owned and [[Franchising|franchised]] stores;  950 of the 5,000 domestic US stores are franchises, commonly located within urban [[shopping malls]] and shopping zones. In addition to the GNC.com website, GNC's products are sold on [[drugstore.com]].

==Lawsuits==
In 1998, GNC was accused of purposely running its franchisees out of business in order to "retake" the stores into corporate control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9902E7D71631F931A1575BC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |title=Franchisees On Edge; Some Angry Ones Sue As GNC Competes |date=2001-08-22 |accessdate=2014-02-11|newspaper=The New York Times |last1=Hays |first1=Constance L. }}&lt;/ref&gt; An April 30, 2003 article states that the GNC corporate company was sued by numerous franchise owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2003/04/28/daily32.html |title=Franchisees sue GNC in New Jersey - Pittsburgh Business Times |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2003-04-30 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint is that the parent company was allowing their corporate owned stores to sell products for less than the franchise stores are allowed to sell them for.  The suit also claimed that GNC charged high "reset fees" to franchisees when there is new signage that needs to be changed in the store or an image facelift that must be done by GNC corporate. A similar lawsuit was filed again in an article written on October 20, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/pittsburgh/stories/2004/10/18/daily15.html?q=gnc%20franchasing%20complaints |title=GNC franchisees file lawsuit - Pittsburgh Business Times |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2014-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2015, [[Attorney General of New York|New York Attorney General]] [[Eric Schneiderman]] sent [[cease and desist]] letters to GNC and other major retailers due to concerning laboratory tests regarding the accuracy of the claimed contents of supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/ag-schneiderman-asks-major-retailers-halt-sales-certain-herbal-supplements-dna-tests|title=A.G.

In October 2015, the Attorney General of Oregon filed a lawsuit against GNC alleging that the company knowingly sold products containing the ingredients [[picamilon]] and [[BMPEA]], which are banned by the FDA.&lt;ref name=Oregon&gt;{{cite news|last1=Aguillard|first1=Anna|title=Oregon's crackdown on GNC part of nation-wide crackdown on dietary supplement industry|url=http://legalnewsline.com/stories/510648727-oregon-s-crackdown-on-gnc-part-of-nation-wide-crackdown-on-dietary-supplement-industry|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=Legal News Line|date=30 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ORegon 1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Alison|title=Oregon AG accuses retailer GNC of selling drug-spiked dietary supplements|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2015/10/22/oregon-lawsuit-gnc-supplements/74344318/|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=USA Today|date=23 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orgeon 3"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Germano|first1=Sara|last2=NG|first2=Serena|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/oregon-sues-gnc-alleging-supplements-contained-illegal-ingredients-1445543143|accessdate=1 December 2015|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, GNC threatened to sue the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] for "significant economic and reputational damages, lost opportunities, and consequential damages", after an advertisement for the chain was blocked from airing during [[Super Bowl LI]]. Despite repeated approvals by Fox, the network stated that the ad had been vetoed by the [[National Football League]] because of GNC's placement on an [[NFLPA]] blacklist for selling products that contain substances banned by the NFL. The letter of intent claimed that Fox had not informed them of any such rules when they purchased the ad time, and cited that the purchase induced them to "spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign" around the commercial. The NFL itself does not prohibit ads for health stores unless they contain references to specific prohibited products; the GNC ad only contained motivational themes and no references to its products.&lt;ref name="usatoday-gnclawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|title=GNC's Super Bowl ad controversy escalates|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2017/02/03/gnc-super-bowl-commercial-controversy-fox/97436046/|website=USA Today|accessdate=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-nflbannedcompany"&gt;{{Cite news|title=GNC's Super Bowl Ad Rejected by NFL|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gncs-super-bowl-ad-rejected-by-nfl-1485886063|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 February 2017|date=2017-01-31|last1=Bruell|first1=Alexandra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-gncban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch the GNC ad the NFL rejected from Super Bowl|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ad-meter/2017/01/31/gnc-ad-commercial-super-bowl-rejected/97275868/|website=USA Today|accessdate=1 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geoarchaeology''' is a multi-disciplinary approach which uses the techniques and subject matter of [[geography]], [[geology]] and other [[Earth science]]s to examine topics which inform [[archaeology|archaeological]] knowledge and thought. Geoarchaeologists study the natural physical processes that affect [[archaeological site]]s such as [[geomorphology]], the formation of sites through geological processes and the effects on buried sites and [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] post-deposition. Geoarchaeologists' work frequently involves studying [[soil]] and [[sediments]] as well as other geographical concepts to contribute an archaeological study. Geoarchaeologists may also use computer cartography, [[geographic information systems]] (GIS) and  [[digital elevation model]]s (DEM) in combination with disciplines from human and social sciences and earth sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sapiens.revues.org/index422.html Ghilardi, M. and Desruelles, S. (2008) “Geoarchaeology: where human, social and earth sciences meet with technology”. ''S.A.P.I.EN.S.'' '''1''' (2) ]&lt;/ref&gt; Geoarchaeology is  important to society because it  informs archaeologists about the geomorphology of the soil, sediments and the rocks on  the buried sites and artifacts they're researching on. By doing this we are able locate ancient cities and artifacts and estimate by the quality of soil how  "prehistoric" they really are.

==Techniques used in geoarchaeology==

===Column sampling===
Column sampling is a technique of collecting samples from a [[archaeological section|section]] for analyzing and detecting the buried processes down the profile of the section. Narrow metal tins are hammered into the section in a series to collect the complete profile for study. If more than one tin is needed they are arranged offset  and overlapping to one side so the complete profile can be rebuilt offsite in laboratory conditions.

===Loss on ignition testing===
Loss on ignition testing for [[soil]] [[Soil organic matter|organic]] content.- a technique of measuring organic content in soil samples. Samples taken from a known place in the profile collected by column sampling are weighed then placed in a fierce oven which burns off the organic content. The resulting cooked sample is weighed again and the resulting loss in weight is an indicator of organic content in the profile at a certain depth. These readings are often used to detect buried soil horizons. A buried soil's [[archaeological horizon|horizons]] may not be visible in [[archaeological section|section]] and this horizon is an indicator of possible occupation levels. Ancient land surfaces especially from the prehistoric era can be difficult to discern so this technique is useful for evaluating an areas potential for [[prehistoric]] surfaces and archaeological evidence. Comparative measurements down the profile are made and a sudden rise in organic content at some point in the profile combined with other indicators is strong evidence for buried surfaces.

[[Image:Columns.002.png|thumb|right|offset column sampling of the soil profile]]

===Magnetic susceptibility analysis===
The magnetic susceptibility of a material is a measure of its ability to become magnetised by an external magnetic field (Dearing, 1999). The magnetic susceptibility of a soil reflects the presence of magnetic iron-oxide minerals such as maghaematite; just because a soil contains a lot of iron does not mean that it will have high magnetic susceptibility. Magnetic forms of iron can be formed by burning and microbial activity such as occurs in top soils and some anaerobic deposits. Magnetic iron compounds can also be found in igneous and metamorphic rocks.

The relationship between iron and burning means that magnetic susceptibility is often used for:
* Site prospection, to identify areas of archaeological potential prior to excavation.
* Identifying hearth areas and the presence of burning residues in deposits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Enhancement of magnetic susceptibility of soils on archaeological sites. |journal= Archaeometry |volume=13  |year=1971 |pages=209–219 |author1=Tite, M.S. |author2=Mullins, C. |doi=10.1111/j.1475-4754.1971.tb00043.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Explaining whether areas of reddening are due to burning or other natural processes such as gleying (waterlogging).

The relationship between soil formation and magnetic susceptibility means that it can also be used to:
* Identify buried soils in depositional sequences.
* Identify redeposited soil materials in peat, lake sediments etc.

===Phosphate and orthophosphate content with spectrophotometry===
Phosphate in man-made soils derives from people, their animals, rubbish and bones. 100 people excrete about 62&amp;nbsp;kg of phosphate annually, with about the same from their rubbish. Their animals excrete even more. A human body contains about 650g of PO4,(500g-80% in the skeleton), which results in elevated levels in burial sites. Most is quickly immobilised on the clay of the soil and ‘fixed’, where it can persist for thousands of years. For a 1 ha site this corresponds to about 150&amp;nbsp;kg PO4 ha-1yr-1 about 0.5% to 10% of that already present in most soils. Therefore, it doesn’t take long for human occupation to make orders of magnitude differences to the phosphate concentration in soil. Phosphorus exist in different ‘pools’ in the soil 1) organic (available), 2) occluded (adsorbed), 3) bound (chemically bound). Each of these pools can be extracted using progressively more aggressive chemicals. Some workers (Eidt especially), think that the ratios between these pools can give information about past land use, and perhaps even dating.
	
Whatever the method of getting the phosphorus from the soil into solution, the method of detecting it is usually the same. This uses the ‘molybdate blue’ reaction, where the depth of the colour is proportional to phosphorus concentration. In the lab, this is measured using a colorimeter, where light shining through a standard cell produces an electric current proportional to the light attenuation. In the field, the same reaction is used on detector sticks, which are compared to a colour chart.

Phosphate concentrations can be plotted on archaeological plans to show former activity areas, and is also used to prospect for sites in the wider landscape.

===Particle size analysis===
The particle size distribution of a soil sample may indicate the conditions under which the [[stratum|strata]] or [[sediment]] were deposited. Particle sizes are generally separated by means of dry or wet sieving (coarse samples such as [[till]], [[gravel]] and [[sand]]s, sometimes coarser [[silt]]s) or by measuring the changes of the density of a dispersed solution (in sodiumpyrophosphate, for example))of the sample (finer silts, [[clay]]s). A rotating clock-glass with a very fine-grained dispersed sample under a heat lamp is useful in separating particles.

The results are plotted on curves which can be analyzed with statistical methods for particle distribution and other parameters.

The fractions received can be further investigated for cultural indicators, macro- and microfossils and other interesting features, so particle size analysis is in fact the first thing to do when handling these samples.

===Trace element geochemistry===
Trace element geochemistry is the study of the abundances of elements in geological materials that do not occur in a large quantity in these materials. Because these trace elements' concentrations are determined by a large number of particular situations under which a certain geological material is formed, they are usually unique between two locations which contain the same type of rock or other geological material.

Geoarchaeologists use this uniqueness in trace element geochemistry to trace ancient patterns of resource-acquisition and trade. For example, researchers can look at the trace element composition of obsidian artifacts in order to "fingerprint" those artifacts. They can then study the trace element composition of obsidian outcrops in order to determine the original source of the raw material used to make the artifact.

===Clay mineralogy analysis===
Geoarchaeologists study the mineralogical characteristics of pots through macroscopic and microscopic analyses. They can use these characteristics to understand the various manufacturing techniques used to make the pots, and through this, to know which production centers likely made these pots. They can also use the mineralogy to trace the raw materials used to make the pots to specific clay deposits.&lt;ref&gt;Druca, I. C. and Q. H. J. Gwynb (1997), From Clay to Pots: A Petrographical Analysis of Ceramic Production in the Callejón de Huaylas, North-Central Andes, Peru, ''Journal of Archaeological Science'', ''25'', 707-718.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ostracod analysis===
Naturally occurring Ostracods in freshwater bodies are impacted by changes in salinity  and pH due to human activities.  Analysis of Ostracod shells in sediment columns show the changes brought about by farming and habitation activities.  This record can be correlated with age dating techniques to help identify changes in human habitation patterns and population migrations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tnesr.com/images/Bayman_et_al._2004.pdf ^ Manuel R.

==Archaeological geology==

'''Archaeological geology''' is a term coined by [[Werner Kasig]] in 1980. It is a sub-field of [[geology]] which emphasises the value of earth constituents for human life.

Halocins are particularly interesting because of the way the pore-forming bacteriocins have been used to probe cell membrane structure and the production and maintenance of energetic ion gradients across the membrane.  The halophiles live at such extreme ion concentrations that they represent a set of unusual solutions and adaptations with regard to their energetic gradients.  The ability to use native halocins to study these gradients provides a motivation for their characterization.

They may have a role in human medicine.&lt;ref name="alberola1"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Halocin H7 decreases infarct size and ectopic beats after mycardial reperfusion in dogs |journal=Journal of Physiology |date=1998 |vauthors=Alberola A, Meseguer I, Torreblanca M, Moya A, Sancho S, Polo B, Soria B, Such L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17615951"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lequerica JL, O'Connor JE, Such L, Alberola A, Meseguer I, Dolz M, Torreblanca M, Moya A, Colom F, Soria B |title=A halocin acting on Na+/H+ exchanger of haloarchaea as a new type of inhibitor in NHE of mammals |journal=[[Journal of Physiology and Biochemistry]] |volume=62 |issue=4 |pages=253–62 |date=2006 |pmid=17615951 |doi=10.1007/BF03165754}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are also found in many of the type species that are used to learn about halophiles in general.&lt;ref name="pmid2720494"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Soppa J, Oesterhelt D |title=Halobacterium sp.

'''Harold Adams Innis''' (November 5, 1894 – November 8, 1952) was a Canadian professor of [[political economy]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and the author of seminal works on media, [[communication theory]], and Canadian [[Economy of Canada|economic]] history.  Despite his dense and difficult prose, Innis was one of Canada's most original thinkers. He helped develop the [[staples thesis]], which holds that Canada's [[Culture of Canada|culture]], [[Politics of Canada|political]] history, and economy have been decisively influenced by the exploitation and export of a series of "staples" such as [[fur trade|fur]], fishing, lumber, wheat, [[mining|mined metals]], and coal.  The staple thesis dominated economic history in Canada 1930s-1960s, and continues to be a fundamental part of the Canadian [[political economy]] tradition.&lt;ref name = "Staples"&gt;Easterbrook, W.T. and Watkins, M.H. (1984) "The Staple Approach". In ''Approaches to Canadian Economic History''. Ottawa: Carleton Library Series, Carleton University Press, pp. 1–98.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's writings on communication explore the role of media in shaping the culture and development of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert E. (2000) "The Communication Thought of Harold Adams Innis". In ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 51–88.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued, for example, that a balance between oral and written forms of communication contributed to the flourishing of [[Ancient Greece|Greek civilization]] in the 5th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, MD: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers Inc., p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; He warned, however, that [[Western culture|Western civilization]] is now imperiled by powerful, [[advertising]]-driven media obsessed by "present-mindedness" and the "continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity".&lt;ref name="Innis"&gt;Innis, Harold. (1952) ''Changing Concepts of Time''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual bond with [[Eric A. Havelock]] formed the foundations of the [[Toronto School of communication theory|Toronto School]] of communication theory, which provided a source of inspiration for future members of the school: [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Edmund Snow Carpenter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/innis-mcluhan/030003-1000-e.html|title=Harold Adams Innis|work=Library Archives Canada|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis laid the basis for scholarship that looked at the social sciences from a distinctly Canadian point of view. As the head of the University of Toronto's political economy department, he worked to build up a cadre of Canadian scholars so that universities would not continue to rely as heavily on British or American-trained professors unfamiliar with Canada's history and culture. He was successful in establishing sources of financing for Canadian scholarly research.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, Alexander John. (2006) ''Marginal Man: The Dark Vision of Harold Innis''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 14–23.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, Innis grew increasingly hostile to the United States. He warned repeatedly that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbor. "We are indeed fighting for our lives," he warned, pointing especially to the "pernicious influence of American advertising.... We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harold A. Innis|title=Changing Concepts of Time|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BuO00eQGdXUC&amp;pg=PA13|year=2004|pages=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His views influenced some younger scholars, including [[Donald Creighton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Wright|title=Donald Creighton: A Life in History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1CSSCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT239|year=2015|pages=174–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis also tried to defend universities from political and economic pressures. He believed that independent universities, as centres of critical thought, were essential to the survival of Western civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) "A Plea for Time". In ''The Bias of Communication.'' Toronto: University of Toronto Press, pp. 83–89.&lt;/ref&gt; His intellectual disciple and university colleague, [[Marshall McLuhan]], lamented Innis's premature death as a disastrous loss for human understanding. McLuhan wrote: "I am pleased to think of my own book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' as a footnote to the observations of Innis on the subject of the psychic and social consequences, first of writing then of printing."&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) ''Marshall McLuhan Unbound.'' Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press v. 8, p. 8. This is a reprint of McLuhan's introduction to the 1964 edition of Innis's book ''The Bias of Communication'' first published in 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
&lt;!--Optional image:[[File:Stamp_Canada_1899_2c.jpg|thumb|right|An 1899 postage stamp. Harold Innis was born near the end of the Victorian era when the "Dominion of Canada" was still a self-governing British colony.]]--&gt;
[[File:Harold-Innis-school.gif|thumb|right|The one-room schoolhouse in Otterville, officially known as S.S.#1 South Norwich. The photo was taken around 1906. Innis is the boy with the cap, fifth from the right, back row. Innis would later teach for a few months at the school.]]

Harold Adams Innis was born in 1894 on a small livestock and dairy farm near the community of [[Otterville, Ontario|Otterville]] in southwestern Ontario's [[Oxford County, Ontario|Oxford County]]. As a boy he loved the rhythms and routines of farm life and he never forgot his rural origins.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, Donald. ''Harold Adams Innis: Portrait of a Scholar''. [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Mary Adams Innis, had named him 'Herald', hoping he would become a minister in the strict evangelical [[Baptist]] faith that she and her husband William shared. At the time, the Baptist Church was an important part of life in rural areas. It gave isolated families a sense of community and embodied the values of individualism and independence. Its far-flung congregations were not ruled by a centralized, bureaucratic authority.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis became an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] in later life, but never lost his interest in religion.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, Robert. ''Canadian Communication Thought: Ten Foundational Writers'', [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; According to his friend and biographer [[Donald Creighton]], Innis's character was moulded by the Church:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The strict sense of values and the feeling of devotion to a cause, which became so characteristic of him in later life, were derived, in part at least, from the instruction imparted so zealously and unquestioningly inside the severely unadorned walls of the Baptist Church at Otterville.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis attended the one-room schoolhouse in Otterville and the community's high school. He travelled {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} by train to [[Woodstock, Ontario]], to complete his secondary education at a Baptist-run college. He intended to become a public-school teacher and passed the entrance examinations for teacher training, but decided to take a year off to earn the money he would need to support himself at an Ontario teachers' college. At age 18, therefore, he returned to the one-room schoolhouse at Otterville to teach for one term until the local school board could recruit a fully qualified teacher. The experience made him realize that the life of a teacher in a small, rural school was not for him.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===University studies===
[[File:RoyalConservatoryofMusic.JPG|thumb|right|The original home of McMaster University at 273 [[Bloor Street]] West, Toronto]]

In October 1913, Innis started classes at [[McMaster University]] (then in Toronto). McMaster was a natural choice for him because it was a Baptist university and many students who attended Woodstock College went there. McMaster's liberal arts professors encouraged critical thinking and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 64–68.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis was especially influenced by James Ten Broeke, the university's one-man philosophy department. Ten Broeke posed an essay question that Innis pondered for the rest of his life: "Why do we attend to the things to which we attend?"&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 326. Innis refers to this question in the preface to ''The Bias of Communication,'' his book of essays on consciousness and communication.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his final undergraduate year at McMaster, Innis spent a summer teaching at the Northern Star School in the frontier farming community of Landonville near [[Vermilion, Alberta]]. The experience gave him a sense of the vastness of Canada. He also learned about Western grievances over high interest rates and steep transportation costs.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt; In his final undergraduate year, Innis focused on history and economics. He kept in mind a remark made by history lecturer W.S. Wallace that the economic interpretation of history was not the only possible one, but that it went the deepest.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War service===
[[File:Harold Adams Innis.jpg|right|thumb|Harold Innis in uniform]]

After graduating from McMaster, Innis felt that his Christian principles compelled him to enlist in the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]]. He was sent to [[France]] in the fall of 1916 to fight in the [[World War I|First World War]].&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 31. Creighton wrote that Innis believed if German aggression went unpunished, it would be fatal to Christian hope for the world. Innis wrote to his sister: "If I had no faith in Christianity, I don't think I would go."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trench warfare]] with its "mud and lice and rats" had a devastating effect on him.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from a later Innis letter by Creighton, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's role as an artillery signaller gave him firsthand experience of life (and death) on the front lines as he participated in the successful Canadian attack on [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]].&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Signallers, or spotters, watched where each [[Shell (projectile)|artillery shell]] landed, then sent back aiming corrections so that the next shells could hit their targets more accurately. On July 7, 1917, Innis received a serious shrapnel wound in his right thigh that required eight months of hospital treatment in England.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis's war was over. His biographer, John Watson, notes the physical wound took seven years to heal, but the psychological damage lasted a lifetime. Innis suffered recurring bouts of depression and nervous exhaustion because of his military service.

Watson also notes that the Great War influenced Innis's intellectual outlook. It strengthened his Canadian [[nationalism]]; sharpened his opinion of what he thought were the destructive effects of technology, including the communications media that were used so effectively to "sell" the war; and led him, for the first time, to doubt his Baptist faith.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 68–117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graduate studies==

===McMaster and Chicago===
Harold Innis completed a [[Master of Arts]] at McMaster, graduating in April 1918. His thesis, called ''The Returned Soldier'', "was a detailed description of the public policy measures that were necessary, not only to provide a supportive milieu to help veterans get over the effects of the war, but also to move on with national reconstruction".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 93. Watson notes that 240,000 young Canadians died in the war, while 600,000 were wounded. The war was a devastating blow to Innis's generation.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Herbert Mead.jpg|thumb|left|George Herbert Mead]]

Innis did his postgraduate work at the [[University of Chicago]] and was awarded his PhD, with a dissertation on the history of [[Canadian Pacific Railway]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harold A. |last=Innis |title=A History of the Canadian Pacific Railway |location=Toronto |publisher=University of Toronto Press |origyear=1923 |year=1971 |edition=Reprint |isbn=0-8020-1704-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in August 1920.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; His two years at Chicago had a profound influence on his later work. His interest in economics deepened and he decided to become a professional economist. The economics faculty at Chicago questioned abstract and universalist [[neoclassical economics|neoclassical theories]], then in vogue, arguing that general rules for economic policy should be derived from specific case studies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis was influenced by the university's two eminent communications scholars, [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Robert E. Park]]. Although he did not attend any of these famous professors' classes, Innis did absorb their idea that communication involved much more than the transmission of information. [[James W. Carey]] writes that Mead and Park "characterized communication as the entire process whereby a culture is brought into existence, maintained in time, and sedimented into institutions".&lt;ref&gt;Carey, J. W. (1992). "Space, Time and Communications: A Tribute to Harold Innis". In ''Communication as Culture: Essays on Media and Society''. New York: Routledge, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Chicago, Innis was exposed to the ideas of [[Thorstein Veblen]], the iconoclastic thinker who drew on his deep knowledge of philosophy and economics to write scathing critiques of contemporary thought and culture. Veblen had left Chicago years before, but his ideas were still strongly felt there. Years later, in an essay on Veblen, Innis praised him for waging war against "standardized static economics".&lt;ref&gt;In this 1929 essay, Innis concluded: "Veblen has waged a constructive warfare of emancipation against the tendency toward standardized static economics which becomes so dangerous on a continent with ever increasing numbers of students clamouring for textbooks on final economic theory." (This essay was republished in Innis, ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', pp. 17–26.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis got his first taste of university teaching at Chicago, where he delivered several introductory economics courses. One of his students was Mary Quayle, the woman he would marry in May 1921 when he was 26 and she 22.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (2003) ''Harold Innis''. Lanham, Md: Rowman and Littlefield Publishers Inc.. p. 5 &amp; pp. 113–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Together they had four children, Donald (1924), Mary (1927), Hugh (1930), and [[Anne Innis Dagg|Anne]] (1933).&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Quayle Innis]] was herself a notable economist and writer. Her book, ''An Economic History of Canada'', was published in 1935.&lt;ref name="Watson, p. 103"&gt;Watson, p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Her novel, ''Stand on a Rainbow'' appeared in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Clara. (1946) ''Canadian Novelists: 1920 – 1945'', Toronto: Longmans, Green and Company, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Her other books include ''Mrs. Simcoe's Diary'' (1965), ''The Clear Spirit: Canadian Women and Their Times'' (1966) and ''Unfold the Years'' (1949), a history of the Young Women's Christian Association.&lt;ref name="Watson, p. 103"/&gt; She also edited Harold Innis's posthumous ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'' (1956) and a 1972 reissue of his ''Empire and Communications.''&lt;ref name="Watson, p. 103"/&gt;

[[Donald Quayle Innis]] became a geography professor at the [[State University of New York]], Mary married a surgeon and did graduate work in French literature, Hugh Innis became a professor at [[Ryerson University]] where he taught communications and economics, [[Anne Innis Dagg]] did doctoral work in biology and became an advisor for the Independent Studies program at the [[University of Waterloo]] and published books on zoology, feminism, and Canadian women's history.&lt;ref&gt;http://cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/viewFile/1391/1472&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of the CPR===
[[File:LastSpike Craigellachie BC Canada - cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Donald Alexander Smith drives the last spike of the Canadian Pacific Railway at Craigellachie, BC—November 7, 1885]]

Harold Innis wrote his PhD thesis on the history of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR). The completion of Canada's first transcontinental railway in 1885 had been a defining moment in Canadian history. Innis's thesis, eventually published as a book in 1923, can be seen as an early attempt to document the railway's significance from an economic historian's point of view. It uses voluminous statistics to underpin its arguments. Innis maintains that the difficult and expensive construction project was sustained by fears of American annexation of the Canadian West.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis argues that "the history of the Canadian Pacific Railroad is primarily the history of the spread of Western civilization over the northern half of the North American continent".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1971) ''A History of the Canadian Pacific Railway.'' Revised ed. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 287.&lt;/ref&gt; As Robert Babe notes, the railway brought industrialization, transporting coal and building supplies to manufacturing sites. It was also a kind of communications medium that contributed to the spread of European civilization. Babe writes that, for Innis, the CPR's equipment "comprised a massive, energy-consuming, fast-moving, powerful, capital-intensive 'sign' dropped into the very midst of indigenous peoples, whose entire way of life was disrupted, and eventually shattered as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Babe, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications scholar [[Arthur Kroker]] argues that Innis's study of the Canadian Pacific Railway was only the first in which he attempted to demonstrate that "technology is not something external to Canadian being; but on the contrary, is the necessary condition and lasting consequence of Canadian existence".&lt;ref&gt;Kroker, Arthur. (1984) ''Technology and the Canadian Mind: Innis/McLuhan/Grant.'' Montreal: New World Perspectives, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  It also reflected Innis's lifelong interest in the exercise of economic and political power. His CPR history ends, for example, with a recounting of Western grievances against economic policies, such as high freight rates and the steep import tariffs designed to protect fledgling Canadian manufacturers. Westerners complained that this [[National Policy]] funnelled money from Prairie farmers into the pockets of the Eastern business establishment. "Western Canada", Innis wrote, "has paid for the development of Canadian nationality, and it would appear that it must continue to pay. The acquisitiveness of Eastern Canada shows little sign of abatement."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, pp. 290–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staples thesis==
Harold Innis is considered the leading founder of a Canadian school of economic thought known as the staples theory. It holds that Canada's culture, political history and economy have been decisively shaped by the exploitation and export of a series of "staples" such as fur, fish, wood, wheat, mined metals and fossil fuels.&lt;ref name = "Staples" /&gt; Innis theorized that this reliance on exporting natural resources made Canada dependent on more industrially advanced countries and resulted in periodic disruptions to economic life as the international demand for staples rose and fell; as the staple itself became increasingly scarce; and, as technological change resulted in shifts from one staple to others.&lt;ref name = "Neill" /&gt; Innis pointed out, for example, that as furs became scarce and trade in that staple declined, it became necessary to develop and export other staples such as wheat, [[potash]] and especially lumber. The export of these new staples was made possible through improved transportation networks that included first canals, and later, railways.&lt;ref name = "Fur Trade" /&gt;

==="Dirt" research===
In 1920, Innis joined the department of political economy at the [[University of Toronto]]. He was assigned to teach courses in commerce, economic history and economic theory. He decided to focus his scholarly research on Canadian economic history, a hugely neglected subject, and he settled on the fur trade as his first area of study. Furs had brought French and English traders to Canada, motivating them to travel west along the continent's interlocking lake and river systems to the Pacific coast. Innis realized that he would not only need to search out archival documents to understand the history of the fur trade, but would also have to travel the country himself gathering masses of firsthand information and accumulating what he called "dirt" experience.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 49–60. The reference to "dirt" experience appears in Watson, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, Innis travelled extensively beginning in the summer of 1924 when he and a friend paddled an {{convert|18|ft|m|adj=on}} canvas-covered canoe hundreds of miles down the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] to [[Lake Athabasca]]; then down the [[Slave River]] to [[Great Slave Lake]]. They completed their journey down the [[Mackenzie River|Mackenzie]], Canada's longest river, to the [[Arctic Ocean]] on a small [[Hudson's Bay Company]] tug.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 61–64.&lt;/ref&gt; During his travels, Innis supplemented his fur research by gathering information on other staple products such as lumber, pulp and paper, minerals, grain and fish. He travelled so extensively that by the early 1940s, he had visited every part of Canada except for the [[Western Arctic]] and the east side of [[Hudson Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Carl. (1976). ''The Writing of Canadian History: Aspects of English-Canadian Historical Writing: 1900–1970.'' Toronto: Oxford University Press. pp. 89–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

Everywhere Innis went his methods were the same: he interviewed people connected with the production of staple products and listened to their stories.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 124.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fur trade in Canada===
{{details|Harold Innis and the fur trade}}
[[File:Beaver-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|North American Beaver, ''Castor canadensis''. Innis argued that it is impossible to understand Canadian history without some knowledge of the beaver's life and habits.]]

Harold Innis's interest in the relationship between empires and colonies was developed in his classic study, ''The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History'' (1930). The book chronicles the trade in beaver fur from the early 16th century to the 1920s. Instead of focusing on the "heroic" European adventurers who explored the Canadian wilderness as conventional histories had done, Innis documents how the interplay of geography, technology and economic forces shaped both the fur trade and Canada's political and economic destiny.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Carl. (1976) ''The Writing of Canadian History''. Toronto: Oxford University Press, pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the fur trade largely determined Canada's boundaries, coming to the conclusion that the country "emerged not in spite of geography but because of it".&lt;ref name = "Fur Trade"&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''The Fur Trade in Canada: An Introduction to Canadian Economic History''. Revised Edition. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 383–402.&lt;/ref&gt;

In line with this observation, Innis notably proposes that European settlement of the Saint Lawrence river valley followed the economic and social patterns of indigenous peoples, making for a Canadian historical and cultural continuity that pre-dates and post-dates European settlement. Unlike many historians who see Canadian history as beginning with the arrival of Europeans, Innis emphasizes the cultural and economic contributions of First Nations peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Dickason, Olive; McNab, David. (2009) ''Canada's First Nations: A History of Founding Peoples from Earliest Times''. Fourth Edition. Don Mills, Ontario: Oxford University Press, p.ix.&lt;/ref&gt; "We have not yet realized," he writes, "that the Indian and his culture was fundamental to the growth of Canadian institutions."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Fur Trade), p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; This Innisian perspective on the development of Canadian political, economic and social institutions was an early form of neo-institutionalism which became an accepted part of the Canadian political science tradition well before American and European counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lecours|first1=Andre|title=New Institutionalism: Theory and Analysis|date=2005|publisher=University of Toronto Press|location=Toronto|jstor=10.3138/9781442677630}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Fur Trade in Canada'' concludes by arguing that Canadian economic history can best be understood by examining how one staple product gave way to another—furs to timber, for example, and the later importance of wheat and minerals.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; Reliance on staples made Canada economically dependent on more industrially advanced countries and the "cyclonic" shifts from one staple to another caused frequent disruptions in the country's economic life.&lt;ref name = "Neill"&gt;[[Robin Neill|Neill, Robin]]. (1972) ''A New Theory of Value: The Canadian Economics of H.A. Innis''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fur Trade in Canada'' also describes the cultural interactions among three groups of people: the Europeans in fashionable metropolitan centres who regarded beaver hats as luxury items; the European colonial settlers who saw beaver fur as a staple that could be exported to pay for essential manufactured goods from the home country, and First Nations peoples who traded furs for industrial goods such as metal pots, knives, guns and liquor.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 152–53.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis describes the central role First Nations peoples played in the development of the fur trade. Without their skilled hunting techniques, knowledge of the territory and advanced tools such as snowshoes, toboggans and birch-bark canoes, the fur trade would not have existed.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Fur Trade), p. 10-15&lt;/ref&gt; However, dependence on European technologies disrupted First Nations societies. "The new technology with its radical innovations", Innis writes, "brought about such a rapid shift in the prevailing Indian culture as to lead to wholesale destruction of the peoples concerned by warfare and disease."&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Fur Trade), p. 388.&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Carl Berger argues that by placing First Nations culture at the centre of his analysis of the fur trade, Innis "was the first to explain adequately the disintegration of native society under the thrust of European capitalism."&lt;ref&gt;Berger, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cod fishery===
{{details|Harold Innis and the cod fishery}}

After the publication of his book on the fur trade, Innis turned to a study of an earlier staple—the [[cod]] fished for centuries off the eastern coasts of North America, especially the [[Grand Banks]] of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. The result was ''The Cod Fisheries: The History of an International Economy'' published in 1940, 10&amp;nbsp;years after the fur trade study. Innis tells the detailed history of competing empires in the exploitation of a teeming natural resource—a history that ranges over 500&amp;nbsp;years. While his study of the fur trade focused on the continental interior with its interlocking rivers and lakes, ''The Cod Fisheries'' looks outward at global trade and empire, showing the far-reaching effects of one staple product both on imperial centres and on marginal colonies such as Newfoundland, [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New England]].

==Communications theories==
{{details|Harold Innis's communications theories}}

Harold Innis's study of the effects of interconnected lakes and rivers on Canadian development and European empire sparked his interest in the complex economic and cultural relationships between transportation systems and communications.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (2007 edition) ''Empire and Communications''. Toronto: Dundurn Press, pp. 23–24. Also see, Patterson, Graeme. (1990) ''History and Communications: Harold Innis, Marshall McLuhan, the Interpretation of History''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], pp. 32–33.&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1940s, Innis also began studying pulp and paper, an industry of central importance to the Canadian economy. This research provided an additional crossover point from his work on staple products to his communications studies.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis "followed pulp and paper through its subsequent stages: newspapers and journalism, books and advertising. In other words, from looking at a natural resource-based industry he turned his attention to a cultural industry in which information, and ultimately knowledge, was a commodity that circulated, had value, and empowered those who controlled it."&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Plato Symposium papyrus.jpg|thumb|right|A Greek copy of Plato's ''Symposium'' from a papyrus roll. Innis argued that Plato's dialogues combined the vitality of the spoken word with the power of writing, a perfect balance between time and space.]]

One of Innis's primary contributions to communications studies was to apply the dimensions of time and space to various media. He divided media into [[Time- and space-bias|time-binding and space-binding types]]. Time-binding media are durable. They include [[clay tablet|clay]] or [[stele|stone tablet]]s. Space-binding media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis examined the rise and fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the interplay between knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis argued that a balance between the spoken word and writing contributed to the flourishing of ancient Greece in the time of [[Plato]].&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), pp. 78–79.&lt;/ref&gt; This balance between the time-biased medium of speech and the space-biased medium of writing was eventually upset, Innis argued, as the oral tradition gave way to the dominance of writing. The torch of empire then passed from Greece to Rome.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Empire), p. 104. See also, Heyer, pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Harold Innis's analysis of the effects of communications on the rise and fall of empires led him to warn grimly that Western civilization was now facing its own profound crisis. The development of powerful communications media such as mass-circulation newspapers had shifted the balance decisively in favour of space and power, over time, continuity and knowledge. The balance required for cultural survival had been upset by what Innis saw as "mechanized" communications media used to transmit information quickly over long distances. These media had contributed to an obsession with "present-mindedness" wiping out concerns about past or future.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1951) ''The Bias of Communication''. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The overwhelming pressure of mechanization evident in the newspaper and the magazine, has led to the creation of vast monopolies of communication. Their entrenched positions involve a continuous, systematic, ruthless destruction of elements of permanence essential to cultural activity.&lt;ref name="Innis"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Western civilization could only be saved, Innis argued, by recovering the balance between space and time. For him, that meant reinvigorating the oral tradition within universities while freeing institutions of higher learning from political and commercial pressures. In his essay, ''A Plea for Time'', he suggested that genuine dialogue within universities could produce the critical thinking necessary to restore the balance between power and knowledge. Then, universities could muster the courage to attack the monopolies that always imperil civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Innis (Bias), pp. 61–91. The comment about universities mustering their courage appears in "The upside of ivory towers" by Rick Salutin. ''Globe and Mail'', September 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Innis remains appreciated and respected for the grand and unique nature of his later efforts regarding communications theories, he was not without critics. Particularly, the fragmentary and mosaic writing style exemplified in ''[[Empire and Communications]]'' has been criticized as ambiguous, aggressively non-linear, and lacking connections between levels of analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Stamps, J. (1991) ''Negative Dialogues: a study of Harold Innis and Marshall McLuhan in the light of the negative dialects of Theodor Adorno and Walter Benjamin.'' Ottawa: Canada National Library, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Biographers have suggested that this style may have been a result of Innis' illness late in his career.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, Paul. (1988) ''Communications and History: Theories of Media, Knowledge and Civilization''. Westport: Greenwood Press, p. 114&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic and public career==

===Influence in the 1930s===
Aside from his work on ''The Cod Fisheries'', Innis wrote extensively in the 1930s about other staple products such as minerals and wheat as well as Canada's immense economic problems in the [[Great Depression]]. During the summers of 1932 and 1933, he travelled to the West to see the effects of the Depression for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, in an essay entitled, ''The Canadian Economy and the Depression'', Innis outlined the plight of "a country susceptible to the slightest ground-swell of international disturbance", yet beset by regional differences that made it difficult to devise effective solutions. He described a Prairie economy dependent on the export of wheat, yet afflicted by severe drought, on the one hand, and the increased political power of Canada's growing cities, sheltered from direct reliance on the staples trade, on the other. The result was political conflict and a breakdown in federal–provincial relations. "We lack vital information on which to base prospective policies to meet this situation", Innis warned, because of "the weak position of the social sciences in Canada".&lt;ref&gt;Innis, Harold. (1956) ''Essays in Canadian Economic History'', edited by Mary Q. Innis. Toronto: [[University of Toronto Press]]. pp. 123–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:old radio.jpg|left|thumb|Radio, a new medium, drew a scathing rebuke from Harold Innis for promoting "small talk" and "bores". Innis believed that both radio and mass circulation newspapers encouraged stereotypical thinking.]]

Innis's reputation as a "public intellectual" was growing steadily and, in 1934, Premier [[Angus Lewis Macdonald|Angus L. Macdonald]] invited him to serve on a Royal Commission to examine [[Nova Scotia]]'s economic problems. The next year, he helped establish ''The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science''. In 1936, he was appointed a full [[University of Toronto]] professor and a year later, became the head of the university's Department of Political Economy.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, pp. 85–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis was appointed president of the Canadian Political Science Association in 1938. His inaugural address, entitled ''The Penetrative Powers of the Price System'', must have baffled his listeners as he ranged over centuries of economic history jumping abruptly from one topic to the next linking monetary developments to patterns of trade and settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The address was an ambitious attempt to show the disruptive effects of new technologies culminating in the modern shift from an industrial system based on coal and iron to the newest sources of industrial power, electricity, oil and steel. Innis also tried to show the commercial effects of mass circulation newspapers, made possible by expanded newsprint production, and of the new medium of radio, which "threatens to circumvent the walls imposed by tariffs and to reach across boundaries frequently denied to other media of communication". Both media, Innis argued, stimulated the demand for consumer goods and both promoted nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, ''Essays'', pp. 252–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis was also a central participant in an international project that produced 25 scholarly volumes between 1936 and 1945. It was a series called ''The Relations of Canada and the United States'' overseen by [[James T. Shotwell]], director of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Innis edited and wrote prefaces for the volumes contributed by Canadian scholars. His own study of the cod fisheries also appeared as part of the series. His work with Shotwell enabled Innis to gain access to Carnegie money to further Canadian academic research. As John Watson points out, "the project offered one of the few sources of research funds in rather lean times".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics and The Great Depression===
[[File:Richard Bedford Bennett.jpg|thumb|right|[[R.B. Bennett]] was the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservative]] Prime Minister of Canada from 1930–35, during the depths of the [[Great Depression]]. Although Innis advocated staying out of politics, he did correspond with Bennett urging him to strengthen the law against business monopolies.]]

The era of the [[Dust Bowl|"Dirty Thirties"]] with its mass unemployment, poverty and despair gave rise to new Canadian political movements. In Alberta, for example, the radio evangelist [[William Aberhart|William "Bible Bill" Aberhart]] led his populist [[Social Credit]] party to victory in 1935. Three years earlier in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], social reformers had founded a new political party, the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] or CCF. It advocated democratic socialism and a [[mixed economy]] with [[public ownership]] of key industries. [[Frank Underhill]], one of Innis's colleagues at the University of Toronto was a founding member of the CCF. Innis and Underhill had both been members of an earlier group at the university that declared itself "dissatisfied with the policies of the two major [political] parties in Canada" and that aimed at "forming a definite body of progressive opinion". In 1931, Innis presented a paper to the group on "Economic Conditions in Canada", but he later recoiled from participating in party politics, denouncing partisans like Underhill as "hot gospellers".&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, Eric. (1982) ''Harold Innis: A Memoir''. Toronto: Harold Innis Foundation, pp. 14–15. The reference to "hot gospellers" can be found in the Creighton biography, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis maintained that scholars had no place in active politics and that instead, they should devote themselves, first to research on public problems, and then to the production of knowledge based on critical thought. He saw the university, with its emphasis on dialogue, open-mindedness and skepticism, as an institution that could foster such thinking and research. "The university could provide an environment", he wrote, "as free as possible from the biases of the various institutions that form the state, so that its intellectuals could continue to seek out and explore other perspectives."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in "The Public Role of the Intellectual", by Liora Salter and Cheryl Dahl. In ''Harold Innis in the New Century.'' (1999) Montreal: McGill-Queen's University Press, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although sympathetic to the plight of western farmers and urban, unemployed workers, Innis did not embrace socialism. [[Eric A. Havelock|Eric Havelock]], a left-leaning colleague explained many years later that Innis distrusted political "solutions" imported from elsewhere, especially those based on [[Marxist]] analysis with its emphasis on [[class conflict]]. He worried, too, that as Canada's ties with Britain weakened, the country would fall under the spell of American ideas instead of developing its own based on Canada's unique circumstances. Havelock added:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
He has been called the radical conservative of his day — not a bad designation of a complex mind, clear sighted, cautious, perhaps at bottom pessimistic in areas where thinkers we would label 'progressive' felt less difficulty in taking a stand; never content to select only one or two elements in a complicated equation in order to build a quick-order policy or program; far ranging enough in intellect to take in the whole sum of the factors, and comprehend their often contradictory effects.&lt;ref&gt;Havelock, pp. 22–23.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Late career and death===
In the 1940s, Harold Innis reached the height of his influence in both academic circles and Canadian society. In 1941, he helped establish the American-based [[Economic History Association]] and its ''[[Journal of Economic History]]''. He later became the association's second president. Innis played a central role in founding two important sources for the funding of academic research: the Canadian Social Science Research Council (1940) and the Humanities Research Council of Canada (1944).&lt;ref&gt;Watson, p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, the [[University of New Brunswick]] awarded Innis an honorary degree, as did his alma mater, [[McMaster University]]. [[Université Laval]], the [[University of Manitoba]] and the [[University of Glasgow]] would also confer honorary degrees in 1947–48.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 223–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, Innis spent nearly a month in the [[Soviet Union]] where he had been invited to attend the 220th anniversary celebrations marking the founding of the country's [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Academy of Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 223–224.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in his essay ''Reflections on Russia'', he mused about the differences between the Soviet "producer" economy and the West's "consumer" ethos:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[A]n economy which emphasizes consumer's goods is characterized by communication industries largely dependent on advertising and by constant efforts to reach the largest number of readers or listeners; an economy emphasizing producer's goods is characterized by communications industries largely dependent on government support. As a result of this contrast, a common public opinion in Russia and the West is hard to achieve.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Heyer, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Innis's trip to Moscow and Leningrad came shortly before U.S.–Soviet rivalry led to the hostility of the [[Cold War]]. Innis lamented this rise in international tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Creighton, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; He saw the Soviet Empire as a stabilizing counterbalance to the American Empire's emphasis on commercialism, the individual and constant change. For Innis, Russia was a society within the Western tradition, not an alien civilization. He abhorred the [[nuclear arms race]], seeing it as the triumph of force over knowledge, a modern form of the medieval [[Inquisition]]. "The Middle Ages burned its heretics", he wrote, "and the modern age threatens them with atom bombs."&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Bias) p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Innis was elected president of the [[Royal Society of Canada]], the country's senior body of scientists and scholars. That same year, he served on the Manitoba Royal Commission on Adult Education and published ''Political Economy in the Modern State'', a collection of his speeches and essays that reflected both his staples research and his new work in communications. In 1947, Innis was appointed the University of Toronto's dean of graduate studies. In 1948, he delivered lectures at the [[University of London]] and [[University of Nottingham|Nottingham University]]. He also gave the prestigious Beit lectures at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], later published in his book ''[[Empire and Communications]]''. In 1949, Innis was appointed as a commissioner on the federal government's [[List of Canadian Royal Commissions|Royal Commission]] on Transportation, a position that involved extensive travel at a time when his health was starting to fail.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 224–25. See also Creighton, pp. 136–40.&lt;/ref&gt; The last decade of his career during which he worked on his communications studies was an unhappy time for Innis. He was academically isolated because his colleagues in economics could not fathom how this new work related to his pioneering research in staples theory. Biographer John Watson writes that "the almost complete lack of positive response to the communications works, contributed to his sense of overwork and depression".&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 250–55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Innis died of [[prostate cancer]] in 1952 a few days after his 58th birthday. In commemoration, [[Innis College]] at the University of Toronto and Innis Library at [[McMaster University]] were named in his honour.

Following his premature death, Innis' significance increasingly deepened as scholars in several academic disciplines continued to build upon his writings. [[Marshall Poe]]'s general media theory that proposes two sub-theories were inspired by Innis. [[Douglas C. North]] expanded on of Innis' "vent for surplus" theory of economic development by applying it to regional development in the United States and underdeveloped countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eh.net/encyclopedia/harold-adams-innis/|title=Harold Adams Innis|work=EH.Net Encyclopedia|accessdate=23 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[James W. Carey]] adopted Innis as a "reference point in his conception of two models of communication".

==Innis and McLuhan==
[[Marshall McLuhan]] was a colleague of Innis's at the University of Toronto. As a young English professor, McLuhan was flattered when he learned that Innis had put his book ''[[Marshall McLuhan#The Mechanical Bride .281951.29|The Mechanical Bride]]'' on the reading list of the fourth-year economics course.&lt;ref&gt;Preface by H. Marshall McLuhan in Havelock, p. 10. Also see Watson, p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan built on Innis's idea that in studying the effects of communications media, technological form mattered more than content. Biographer Paul Heyer writes that Innis's concept of the "bias" of a particular medium of communication can be seen as a "less flamboyant precursor to McLuhan's legendary phrase '[[the medium is the message]].'"&lt;ref&gt;Heyer, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis, for example, tried to show how printed media such as books or newspapers were "biased" toward control over space and secular power, while engraved media such as stone or clay tablets were "biased" in favour of continuity in time and metaphysical or religious knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Innis, (Empire) p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan focused on what may be called a medium's "sensory bias" arguing, for example, that books and newspapers appealed to the rationality of the eye, while radio played to the irrationality of the ear.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2003) ''Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man''. Corte Madera, California: Gingko Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The differences in the Innisian and McLuhanesque approaches were summarized by the late James W. Carey:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Both McLuhan and Innis assume the centrality of communication technology; where they differ is in the principal kinds of effects they see deriving from this technology. Whereas Innis sees communication technology principally affecting social organization and culture, McLuhan sees its principal effect on sensory organization and thought. McLuhan has much to say about perception and thought but little to say about institutions; Innis says much about institutions and little about perception and thought.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, James W. "Harold Adams Innis and Marshall McLuhan" in ''McLuhan Pro and Con'' (1969) Baltimore: Pelican Books, p. 281. Graeme Patterson strongly disagrees with this view arguing that Innis paid an extraordinary amount of attention to perception and thought, while McLuhan examined institutions. Both Innis and McLuhan, Patterson argues, were preoccupied with language, one of humanity's basic institutions. See Patterson, pp. 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Biographer John Watson notes that Innis's work was profoundly political while McLuhan's was not. He writes that "the mechanization of knowledge, not the relative sensual bias of media, is the key to Innis's work. This also underlies the politicization of Innis's position vis-a-vis that of McLuhan." Watson adds that Innis believed very different media could produce similar effects. "For Innis, the [[Yellow journalism|yellow press]] of the United States and the Nazi loudspeaker had the same form of negative effect: they reduced men from thinking beings to mere automatons in a chain of command." Watson argues that while McLuhan separated media according to their sensory bias, Innis examined a different set of interrelationships, the "[[dialectic]] of power and knowledge" in specific historical circumstances. For Watson, Innis's work is therefore more flexible and less deterministic than McLuhan's.&lt;ref&gt;Watson, pp. 410–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

As scholars and teachers, Innis and McLuhan shared a similar dilemma since both argued that book culture tended to produce fixed points of view and homogeneity of thought; yet both produced many books. In his introduction to the 1964 reprint of ''The Bias of Communication'', McLuhan marvelled at Innis's technique of juxtaposing "his insights in a mosaic structure of seemingly unrelated and disproportioned sentences and aphorisms". McLuhan argued that although this made reading Innis's dense prose difficult—"a pattern of insights that are not packaged for the consumer palate"—Innis's method approximated "the natural form of conversation or dialogue rather than of written discourse". Best of all, it yielded "insight" and "pattern recognition" rather than the "classified knowledge" so overvalued by print-trained scholars. "How exciting it was to encounter a writer whose every phrase invited prolonged meditation and exploration", McLuhan added.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall. (2005) ''Marshall McLuhan Unbound.'' Corte Madera, CA : Gingko Press, v.8, pp. 5–8.&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan's own books with their reliance on aphorisms, puns, quips, "probes" and oddly juxtaposed observations also employ this mosaic technique.

Innis's theories of political economy, media and society remain highly relevant: he had a profound influence on [[Media studies|critical media theory]] and communications and, in conjunction with McLuhan, offered groundbreaking Canadian perspectives on the function of communication technologies as key agents in social and historical change. Together, their works advanced a theory of history in which communication is central to social change and transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Carey, (McLuhan Pro and Con), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">{{Occupational hazards}}

'''Hazard elimination''' is a hazard control strategy based on completely removing a material or process causing a hazard.  Elimination is the most effective of the five members of the [[hierarchy of hazard controls]] in protecting workers, and where possible should be implemented before all other control methods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/hierarchy/|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=2016-07-18|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYCOSH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nycosh.org/index.php?page=Hierarchy-of-Hazard-Controls|title=Hierarchy of Hazard Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=New York Committee for Occupational Safety &amp; Health|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305133129/http://nycosh.org/index.php?page=Hierarchy-of-Hazard-Controls|archive-date=2012-03-05|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OHS answers"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/hsprograms/hazard_control.html|title=Hazard Control|last=|first=|date=2006-04-20|website=[[Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety]]|publisher=|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many jurisdictions require that an employer eliminate hazards if it is possible, before considering other types of hazard control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|title=Hazard Identification, Elimination and Control|last=|first=|date=|website=Health Sciences Association of Alberta|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170314062833/https://www.hsaa.ca/effective-representation/hazard-identification-elimination-and-control|archive-date=2017-03-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=2017-03-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Elimination is most effective early in the design process, when it may be inexpensive and simple to implement.  It is more difficult to implement for an existing process, when major changes in equipment and procedures may be required.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Elimination can fail as a strategy if the hazardous process or material is reintroduced at a later stage in the design or production phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://machinerysafety101.com/2011/02/28/understanding-the-hierarchy-of-controls/|title=Understanding the Hierarchy of Controls|last=Nix|first=Doug|date=2011-02-28|website=Machinery Safety 101|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete elimination of hazards is a major component to the philosophy of [[Prevention through design|Prevention through Design]], which promotes the practice of eliminating hazards at the earliest design stages of a project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/ptd/|title=Prevention through Design|last=|first=|date=2016-07-29|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complete elimination of a hazard is often the most difficult control to achieve, but addressing it at the start of a project allows designers and planners to make large changes much more easily without the need to retrofit or redo work.

== Typical examples ==
Removing the use of a hazardous chemical is an example of elimination.&lt;ref name="NYCOSH" /&gt;  Some substances are difficult or impossible to eliminate because they have unique properties necessary to the process, but it may be possible to instead substitute less hazardous versions of the substance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Elimination also applies to equipment as well.  For example, [[Health effects from noise|noisy]] equipment can be removed from a room used for other purposes,&lt;ref name="saunions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saunions.org.au/ohs/hierachy_of_controls.htm|title=Hierarchy of Controls|last=|first=|date=|website=[[SA Unions]]|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050623055058/http://www.saunions.org.au/ohs/hierachy_of_controls.htm|archive-date=2005-06-23|dead-url=yes|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or an unnecessary blade can be removed from a machine.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://simplifiedsafety.com/blog/the-hierarchy-of-controls-part-one-elimination-and-substitution/|title=The Hierarchy of Controls, Part One: Elimination and Substitution|last=Braun|first=John|date=|website=Simplified Safety Fall Protection Blog|access-date=2017-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prompt repair of damaged equipment eliminates hazards stemming from their malfunction.&lt;ref name="saunions" /&gt;

Elimination also applies to processes.  For example, the risk of [[Falling (accident)|falls]] can be eliminated by eliminating the process of working in a high area, by using extending tools from the ground instead of climbing,&lt;ref name="hse UK"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/treework/safety-topics/height.htm#control|title=Tree Work – Working at height|last=|first=|date=|website=UK [[Health and Safety Executive]]|publisher=|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or moving a piece to be worked on to ground level.&lt;ref name="NYCOSH" /&gt;  The need for workers to enter a hazardous area such as a [[grain elevator]] can be eliminated by installing equipment that performs the task automatically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://progressivesafety.us/uncategorized/hierarchy-of-controls-prioritizes-action-on-workplace-hazards/|title=Hierarchy of Controls Prioritizes Action on Workplace Hazards|last=Mlynek|first=Joe|date=|work=Progressive Safety Services|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eliminating an inspection that requires opening a package containing a hazardous material reduces the inhalation hazard to the inspector.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-102/default.html|title=Current Strategies for Engineering Controls in Nanomaterial Production and Downstream Handling Processes|last=|first=|date=November 2013|website=U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Haalth|pages=9–10|language=en-us|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''historical figure''' is a famous person in [[history]], such as [[Catherine the Great]], [[Abraham Lincoln]], [[George Washington]], or [[Napoleon]].

The significance of such figures in human progress has been debated. Some think they play a crucial role, while others say they have little impact on the broad currents of thought and social change.  The concept is generally used in the sense that the person really existed in the past, as opposed to being legendary.  However, the legends that can grow up around historical figures may be hard to distinguish from fact.  Sources are often incomplete and may be inaccurate, particularly those from early periods of history. Without a body of personal documents, the more subtle aspects of personality of a historical figure can only be deduced. With historical figures who were also religious figures attempts to separate fact from belief may be controversial.

In education, presenting information as if it were being told by a historical figure may give it greater impact. Since classical times, students have been asked to put themselves in the place of a historical figure as a way of bringing history to life. Historical figures are often represented in fiction, where fact and fancy are combined. In earlier traditions, before the rise of a critical historical tradition, authors took less care to be as accurate when describing what they knew of historical figures and their actions, interpolating imaginary elements intended to serve a moral purpose to events: such is [[Notker the Stammerer|the Monk of St. Gall]]'s anecdotal account of [[Charlemagne]], ''De Carolo Magno''. More recently there has been a tendency once again for authors to freely depart from the "facts" when they conflict with their creative goals.

==Significance==
The significance of historical figures has long been the subject of debate by philosophers. [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] (1770–1831) considered that "world-historical figures" played a pivotal role in human progress, but felt that they were bound to emerge when change was needed. [[Thomas Carlyle]] (1795–1881) saw the study of figures such as [[Muhammad]], [[William Shakespeare]] and [[Oliver Cromwell]] as key to understanding history. [[Herbert Spencer]] (1820–1903), an early believer in evolution and in the universality of natural law, felt that historical individuals were of little importance.

===Hegel's world-historical figure===
[[File:G.W.F. Hegel (by Sichling, after Sebbers).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] introduced the concept of the "world-historical figure".]]
The German philosopher Hegel defined the concept of the world-historical figure, who embodied the ruthless advance of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s World Spirit, often overthrowing outdated structures and ideas.  To him, [[Napoleon]] was such a figure.{{sfn|Hagen|2012|p=125}}
Hegel proposed that a world-historical figure essentially posed a challenge, or thesis, and this would generate an antithesis, or opposing force. Eventually a synthesis would resolve the conflict.{{sfn|Van Doren|2008|p=277}}
Hegel viewed [[Julius Caesar]] as a world historical figure, who appeared at a stage when Rome had grown to the point it could no longer continue as a republican city state but had to become an empire.  Caesar failed in his bid to make himself an emperor, and was assassinated, but the empire came into existence soon afterward, and Caesar's name has become synonymous with "emperor" in forms such as "[[kaiser]]" or "[[czar]]".{{sfn|Karatani|2011|p=20}}

[[Søren Kierkegaard]], in his early essay ''The Concept of Irony'', generally agrees with Hegel's views, such as his characterization of [[Socrates]] as a world-historical figure who acted as a destructive force on Greek received views of morality.{{sfn|Stewart|2007|p=179}}
In Hegel's view, Socrates broke down social harmony by questioning the meaning of concepts like "justice" and "virtue".
Eventually, the Athenians quite rightly *(Name source) condemned Socrates to death. But they could not stop the evolution of thought that Socrates had begun, which would lead to the concept of individual conscience.{{sfn|Magee|2001|p=192}}
Hegel said of world-historical figures,
{{blockquote|It was theirs to know this nascent principle; the necessary, directly sequent step in progress, which their world was to take; to make this their aim, and to expend their energy in promoting it ... They die early like Alexander; they are murdered, like Caesar; transported to St. Helena, like Napoleon ... They are ''great'' men, because they willed and accomplished something great; not a mere fancy, a mere intention, but that which met the case and fell in with the needs of the age.{{sfn|Cramer|2007|p=272}}}}

However, Hegel, [[Thomas Carlyle]] and others noted that the great historical figures were just representative men, expressions of the material forces of history.  Essentially they have little choice about what they do. This is in conflict with the views of [[George Bancroft]] or [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], who praised self-reliance and individualism, and in conflict with [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], who also felt that individuals can determine their destiny.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=5}}
Engels found that Hegel's system contained an "internal and incurable contradiction", resting as it does on both [[Hegelian dialectic|dialectical relativism]] and idealistic absolutism.{{sfn|Moses|2004|p=xv}}

===Spencerian view===
[[File:Spencer1.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Herbert Spencer]], who considered events in the lives of kings "historic trivalities"]]
The Scottish philosopher and evolutionist [[Herbert Spencer]], who was highly influential in the latter half of the nineteenth century, felt that historical figures were relatively unimportant.
He wrote to a friend, "I ignore utterly the personal element in history, and, indeed, show little respect for history altogether as it is ordinarily conceived."
He wrote, "The births, deaths,  and marriages of kings, and other like historic trivialities, are committed to memory, not because of any direct benefits that can possibly result from knowing them:  but because society considers them parts of a good education."{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188}}
In his essay ''What Knowledge Is of Most Worth?'' he wrote:
{{blockquote|That which constitutes History,  properly so called, is in great part omitted from works on the subject. Only of late years have historians commenced giving us, in any considerable quantity, the truly valuable information. As in past ages the king was everything and the people nothing; So, in past histories, the doings of the king fill the entire picture, to which the national life forms but an obscure background. While only now, when the welfare of nations rather than of rulers is becoming the dominant idea, are historians beginning to occupy themselves with the phenomena of social progress. The thing it really concerns us to know is the natural history of society.{{sfn|Carneiro|1981|p=188-189}}}}

===Inevitability or determinism===
Taken to an extreme, one may consider that what Hegel calls the "world spirit" and [[T. S. Eliot]] calls "those vast impersonal forces" hold us in their grip.  What happens is predetermined.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}} 
Both Hegel and Marx advocated historical inevitability in contrast to the doctrine of contingency, allowing for alternative outcomes, that was advocated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Michel Foucault]] and others.{{sfn|Ben-Menahem|2011|p=chapter 9}}
However, Marx argued against the use of the  "historical inevitability" argument when used to explain the destruction of early communes in Russia.{{sfn|Chakrabarti|2009|p=158}}
As an orthodox Marxist, [[Vladimir Lenin]] accepted the laws of history that Marx had discovered, including the historical inevitability of capitalism followed by a transition to socialism.
Despite this, Lenin also believed the transition could be effected faster by voluntary action.{{sfn|Chen|2007|p=37}}

In 1936 [[Karl Popper]] published an influential paper on ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'', published as a book in 1957, that attacked the doctrine of historical inevitability.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=218}}
The historian [[Isaiah Berlin]], author of ''Historical Inevitability'', also argued forcibly against this view, going as far as to say that some choices are entirely free and cannot be predicted scientifically.{{sfn|White|2004|p=52}}
Berlin presented his views in a 1953 lecture at the [[London School of Economics]], published soon afterwards.  When speaking he referred to [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]]'s views, but the published version speaks approvingly of Karl Popper, which caused a stir among academics.{{sfn|Agassi|2008|p=152}}

===Heroic view===
[[File:Carlyle by Elliott &amp; Fry c1860s.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Thomas Carlyle]], champion of study of great men]]
[[Thomas Carlyle]] has espoused the "heroic view" of history, famously saying in his essay on the Norse god [[Odin]] in his book ''On heroes, hero-worship, &amp; the heroic in history'' that "No great man lives in vain. The History of the world is but the Biography of great men ... We do not now call our great men Gods, nor admire ''without'' limit; ah no, ''with'' limit enough! But if we have no great men, or do not admire at all,— that were a still worse case."{{sfn|Carlyle|1841|p=47}}
Carlyle's historical philosophy was based on the "[[Great Man theory]]", saying, "Universal History, the history of what man has accomplished in the world ... [is] at bottom the History of the Great Men who have worked here."
An extreme believer in individuality, he also believed that the masses of people should let themselves be guided by the great leaders of men.{{sfn|Carlyle|2007|p=9}}
Talking of poets he said,
{{blockquote|That ideal outline of himself, which a man unconsciously shadows forth in his writings, and which, if rightly deciphered, will be truer than any other representation of him, it is the task of the Biographer to fill-up into an actual coherent figure, and to bring him to our experience, or at least our clear undoubted admiration, thereby to instruct and edify us in many ways. Conducted on such principles, the Biography of great men, especially of great Poets, that is, of men in the highest degree noble-minded and wise, might become one of the most dignified and valuable species of composition.{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=138}}}}
More recently, in his 1943 book ''The Hero in History'', the [[Pragmatism|pragmatist]] scholar [[Sidney Hook]] asserts:
{{blockquote|That history is made by men and women is no longer denied except by some theologians and mystical metaphysicians.  And even they are compelled indirectly to acknowledge this commonplace truth, for they speak of historical personages as 'instruments' of Providence, Justice, Reason, Dialectic, the ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', or Spirit of the Times.  Men agree more readily about the consequences of the use of 'instruments' in history than they do about the ultimate ends 'instruments' allegedly serve, or the first causes by which they are allegedly determined.{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xi}}}}
Hook recognizes the relevance of the environment within which the "great man" or "hero" acted, but asserts that this can provide the backdrop but never the plot of the "dramas of human history". and distinguish life and species{{sfn|Hook|1943|p=xiii}}

===Ranking===
[[File:Crucifixion by Jacob Jordaens.JPG|thumb|right|upright|The crucifixion of Jesus, the founder of [[Christianity]], painted by [[Jacob Jordaens]] in the 17th century.]]
There have been rankings of the significance of major historical figures.  For example, [[Cesar A. Hidalgo]] and colleagues at the [[MIT Media Lab]] has calculated the memorability of historical figures using data such as the number of language editions for which there are articles for each person, the pageviews received, and other factors.  These lists are available at MIT's [http://pantheon.media.mit.edu Pantheon ] project.

==Historical truth==
It is sometimes hard to discern whether apparently historical figures from the earliest periods did in fact exist, due to the lack of records.  Even with more recent personages, stories or anecdotes about the person often accumulate that have no basis in fact.  Although the external aspects of a historical figure may be well documented, their inner nature can only be a subject of speculation.  With religious figures, often the subjects of voluminous literature, separating "fact" from "belief" can be difficult if not impossible.

===Ancient figures===
With older texts it can be difficult to be sure whether a person in the text is, in fact, a historical figure. "Wisdom literature" from early middle-eastern cultures (such as the [[Book of Job]]), mainly consist of verbal expositions or discussions that must be considered the work of the author, rather than the character supposedly speaking. It may still be possible to identify a figure in such texts with a historical figure known from some other context, and the text may be taken as informative about this figure, even if not verified by an independent source.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=335}} On the other hand, a text may include realistic settings and references to historical people, while the central character may or may not be a historical figure.{{sfn|Longman|Enns|2008|p=336}}

===Fables===
[[File:Lady Godiva (John Collier, c. 1897).jpg|thumb|[[Lady Godiva]] was a historical figure, but there is no evidence that the legend of her riding naked through the streets is true (''[[Lady Godiva (painting)|Lady Godiva]]'' painting, 1897 by [[John Collier (painter)|John Collier]])]]

Napoleon spoke of history as being a [[fable]] which had been agreed upon:– "''la fable convenue qu'on appellera l'histoire''".{{sfn|Napoleon &amp; Auguste-Dieudonné 1823|p=242}} Great figures of the past have stories told about them which grow in the telling, and so become [[myth]]s and [[legend]]s which may dominate or displace the more prosaic historical facts about them. For example, some ancient chroniclers said that the Emperor [[Nero]] fiddled while Rome burned, but [[Tacitus]] disputed this by saying the stories were just malicious rumours. Similarly, there is no good evidence that [[Marie-Antoinette]] ever said "let them eat cake", or that [[Lady Godiva]] rode naked through the streets of [[Coventry]].{{sfn|Andrews|2012}}

===Personality===
[[Thomas Carlyle]] pointed out that even to the person living it, every life "remains in so many points unintelligible".  The historian must struggle when writing biographies, "the very facts of which, to say nothing of the purport of them, we know not, and cannot know!"{{sfn|Kerry|Hill|2010|p=133-134}}
Some psychologists have sought to understand the personalities of historical figures through clues about the way in which they were raised. However, this theoretical psychoanalytic approach is not supported empirically. An alternative approach, favored by [[Psychobiography|psychobiographers]] such as [[William Runyan]], is to explain the personality of the historical figure in terms of their life history. This approach has the advantage of recognizing that personality may evolve over time in response to events.{{sfn|Roberts|1996|p=208}}

[[File:Confucius Laozi Buddha.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Three great historical figures — [[Confucius]] presenting the [[Buddha]] to [[Lao Tsu]]. They are all of such antiquity that the historical facts about them are now overlaid with centuries of myth and legend.]]

===Religious figures===
With historical religious figures, fact and belief may be difficult to disentangle.
There are cultural differences in the treatment of historical figures. Thus the Chinese can recognise that [[Mencius]] or [[Confucius]] were historical individuals, while also endowing them with sanctity. In Indian [[Hinduism]], on the other hand, figures such as [[Krishna]] or [[Rama]] are almost always seen as embodiments of gods rather than as historical people. The [[Nirvana Sutra]] states: "Do not rely on the man but on the Dharma." A teacher such as [[Gautama Buddha]] is thus treated almost exclusively as a lesser god rather than a historical figure.{{sfn|Yuasa|Kasulis|1987|p=128}}

[[E. P. Sanders]], author of ''The Historical Figure of Jesus'', called Jesus of Nazareth "one of the most important figures in human history".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=1}} Various writers have struggled to present [[Historical Jesus|"historical" views of Jesus]], as opposed to views distorted by belief.{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}} When writing about this subject, a historian who relies only on sources other than the [[New Testament]] may be criticized for implying that it is not a sufficient source of information about the subject.{{sfn|Habermas|1996|p=11}}

The theologian [[Martin Kähler]] is known for his work ''Der sogenannte historische Jesus und der geschichtliche, biblische Christus'' (The so-called historical Jesus, and the historic, biblical Christ). He clearly distinguished between "the Jesus of history" and "the Christ of faith".{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=4}} Some historians openly admit bias, which may anyway be unavoidable. Paul Hollenback says he writes about the historical Jesus, "...in order to overthrow, not simply correct, the mistake called Christianity."  Another historian who has written about Jesus, Frederick Gaiser, says, "historical investigation is part and parcel of biblical faith."{{sfn|Powell|1998|p=3}}

{{clear}}

==Political appropriation==
[[File:Stilke Hermann Anton - Joan of Arc's Death at the Stake.jpg|thumb|upright|An 1843 view of a heroic [[Joan of Arc]] at the stake.]]
A historical figure may be interpreted to support political aims.
In France in the first half of the seventeenth century,&lt;!--didn't the big Joan thing take place around the time of Napoleon?--&gt; there was an outpouring of writing about [[Joan of Arc]], including seven biographies, three plays and an epic poem. Joan had become a symbol of national pride and the Catholic faith, helping unite a country that had been divided by the recent [[French Wars of Religion|wars of religion]].  The reality of the historical Joan was subordinated to the need for a symbol of feminine strength, Christian virtue and resistance to the English.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=1}}
[[George Bernard Shaw]], introducing his 1923 play ''[[Saint Joan (play)|Saint Joan]]'', discussed representations of Joan by other authors.
He felt that [[William Shakespeare]]'s depiction in ''[[Henry VI, Part 1]]'' was constrained from making her a "beautiful and romantic figure" by political considerations. [[Voltaire]]'s version in his poem ''[[La Pucelle d'Orléans]]'' was also flawed by Voltaire's biases and [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s play ''[[Die Jungfrau von Orleans]]'' "is not about Joan at all, and can hardly be said to pretend to be."{{sfn|Innes|1998|p=208}}

A historical figure may be used to validate a politician's claim to authority,
where the modern leader shapes and exploits the ideas associated with the historical figure,
which they are presumed to have inherited.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=60}}
Thus [[Jesse Jackson]] has frequently evoked the spirit of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=51}}
[[Fidel Castro]] often presented himself as following the path defined by [[José Martí]].{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=64}}
[[Hugo Chávez]] of Venezuela has frequently identified himself with the historical figure [[Simón Bolívar]], the liberator of South America from Spanish rule.{{sfn|Mixon|2009|p=125}}

Hegel believed in the role of the state in guaranteeing individual liberties, and his views were therefore rejected by the German National Socialists, who considered him dangerously liberal and perhaps a proto-Marxist. On the other hand, [[Adolf Hitler]] identified himself as a Hegelian world historical figure, and justified his actions on this basis.{{sfn|Cobley|2002|p=278}}

==In education==
[[Plato]] used historical figures in his writing, but only to illustrate his points. [[Xenophon]] used [[Cyrus the Great]] in the same way.
When Plato apparently quotes [[Socrates]] in ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'', it is only to add dramatic effect to the presentation of his own thought.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} For this reason, Plato's writings on Socrates tell us little, at least directly, about Socrates. The historical figure is used only as a device for communicating Plato's ideas.{{sfn|Anton|Preus|1971|p=162}} In classical Rome, students of rhetoric had to master the ''[[suasoria]]'' — a form of [[declamation]] in which they wrote the soliloquy of a historical figure who was debating a critical course of action.  For example, the poet [[Juvenal]] wrote a speech for the dictator [[Sulla]], in which he was counselled to retire. The poet [[Ovid]] enjoyed this exercise more than the other final challenge — the ''[[controversia]]''.{{sfn|Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics|p=212}}

The German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] wrote an influential essay "On the Uses and Disadvantages of History for Life". He said "the unhistorical and historical are necessary in equal measure for the health of an individual, of a people and of a culture."{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=2}}
Nietzsche identifies three approaches to history, each with dangers.
The monumental approach describes the glories of the past, often focusing on heroic figures like [[Elizabeth I of England]] or [[Louis Pasteur]]. 
By treating these figures as models, the student is tempted to consider that there can be nobody of such stature today.
The antiquarian view examines the past in minute and reverent detail, turning its back on the present.
The critical approach challenges traditional views, even though they may be valid.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=3}}

Historical figures may today be simulated as [[animated pedagogical agent]]s to teach history and foreign culture. An example is [[Freudbot]], which acted the part of [[Sigmund Freud]] for psychology students. When a variety of simulated character types were tried as educational agents, students rated historical figures as the most engaging.{{sfn|Veletsianos|2010|p=16}}
There are [[gender difference]]s in the perception of historical figures.  When modern US schoolchildren were asked to roleplay or illustrate historical stereotypes, boys tended to focus upon male figures exclusively while girls showed more varied family groupings.{{sfn|Fournier|Wineburg|1997|p=160-185}}

==In branding==
Using historical figures in marketing communicationsn and in branding is a new area of marketing research but historical figures’ names were used to promote products as early as in the Middle Ages&lt;ref&gt;Madow M., Private Ownership of Public Image: Popular Culture and Publicity Rights, vol. 81, California Law Review 125, 1993, p. 152.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Historical figure brand is using famous historical person in branding, for instance [[Mozartkugel]], [[Chopin (vodka)]] or Café Einstein https://www.cafeeinstein.com/. 

Historical figure is a person who lived in the past and whose deeds exerted a significant impact on other people’s lives and consciousness. These figures are attributed with certain features that are a compilation of the actual values they proclaimed and the manner they were perceived by others. This perception evolves and subsequent generations read the biography of a given historical figure in their own way through their own knowledge and experience. In order to determine the popularity of the commercialisation of historical figures, a study was conducted at the beginning of 2014 on the number of trademark protection applications filed with the Patent Office of the Republic of Poland as a measure of entrepreneurs’ interest in this activity. The names of 300 most prominent Polish historical figures &lt;ref&gt;Grygiel A.(ed.), Encyklopedia sławnych Polaków, Publicat S.A., Poznań 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; were considered. The study showed that over 21% of the names analysed were recorded in the trademark register. 1,033 trademark protection applications were filed for 64 names out of the 300 historical figures investigated [Aldona Lipka, 2015,&lt;ref&gt;Lipka Aldona, Ograniczona racjonalność i heurystyki w zachowaniach nabywców [w:] G. Wolska (red.), Współczesne problemy ekonomiczne, Zeszyty Naukowe nr 858, Wyd. Uniwersytet Szczeciński, Szczecin 2015. p. 265.(https://scholar.google.pl/citations?user=8g7DDDkAAAAJ&amp;hl=pl&amp;oi=ao)&lt;/ref&gt;]. The greatest number of trademark protection applications were recorded for [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko]] (295), followed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] (250), [[John III Sobieski]] (94) and [[Chopin]] (81).

==In art and literature==
[[File:Henry IV 1 title page.jpg|thumb|upright|[[William Shakespeare]] wrote a number of plays that dramatized the lives of historical figures, but introduced fictional characters such as [[Falstaff|Sir John Falstaff]].]]

===Realist historical fiction===
There is a huge body of historical fiction, where the text includes both imaginary and factual elements. In early English literature, [[Robin Hood]] was a fictional character, but the historical King [[Richard I of England]] also appears.{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xviii}}
[[William Shakespeare]]{{efn|William Shakespeare was a historical figure himself, but as a biographer said, "Such materials as there are for Shakespeare's personal history, or for the history of anyone connected with him, have been gathered with the most loving and persevering industry. Unhappily, they amount to very little.  Entries in municipal records, names in a will, a lease, or an inventory, tell hardly anything of the life or character of the man.  That orange has now been squeezed dry."{{sfn|Smith|1899|p=7}}}} wrote [[List of historical figures dramatised by Shakespeare|plays about people who were historical figures in his day]], such as ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]''. He did not present these people as pure history, but dramatised their lives as a commentary about the people and politics of his own time.{{sfn|Hattaway|2002|p=16}}
Napoleon figured in [[Victor Hugo]]'s 1862 classic ''[[Les Misérables]]''.{{sfn|Powers|Gale|1981|p=65}}
There are many more examples.

The compiler of a survey of historical novels in the 1920s claimed that the "appearance of reality ... is the great charm of the historical novel." He went on to assert, regarding novels about periods of which little is known, that "the danger is that the very elements which add to our interest in the tale as such will go far to mislead us in our conception of the period dealt with".{{sfn|Nield|1929|p=xix}}
Traditionally the treatment of historical figures in fiction was realistic in style and respectful of fact. A historical novel would be true to the facts known about the period in which the novel is set, a [[biographical novel]] would follow the facts that are known about the protagonist's life, and a "[[roman à clef]]" would try to give an accurate interpretation of what is known about a public figure's private life. In each genre, the novelist would avoid introducing any elements that were clearly in conflict with the facts.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}

A writer may be handicapped by his readers' preconceptions about a historical person, which may or may not be accurate, and the facts about the historical person may also conflict with the novelist's plot requirements.{{sfn|Lukacs|1937|p=168}}
According to the Marxist philosopher [[György Lukács]] in his 1937 book on ''The Historical Novel'', "The 'world-historical individual' can only figure as a minor character in the [historical] novel because of the complexity and intricacy of the whole social-historical process."{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=113}}
As Jacobs observes, the "realist aesthetic" of the historical novel "assumes that a recognizable historical figure in fiction must not 'do things' its model did not do in real life; it follows that historical figures can be used only in very limited ways."{{sfn|Wyile|2002|p=16}}
The author of a traditional historical novel should therefore focus more on the people who have been lost to history.{{sfn|Waters|2009|p=112}}
A novelist such as Sir [[Walter Scott]] or [[Leo Tolstoy]] (''[[War and Peace]]'') would describe historical events accurately. They would give rein to their imagination only in scenes that were not significant historically, when interactions with fictional characters could safely be introduced.{{sfn|Wachtel|1995|p=114}}

===Modern fiction===
More recently, however, starting with works such as ''[[The Confessions of Nat Turner]]'', and ''[[Sophie's Choice (novel)|Sophie's Choice]]'' by [[William Styron]],
the novelist has felt more free to introduce much larger amounts of purely imaginary detail about historical people.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xv}}
[[E. L. Doctorow]] illustrates this different attitude when discussing his book ''[[Ragtime (novel)|Ragtime]]'': "Certain details were so delicious that I was scrupulous about getting them right. Others&amp;nbsp;... demanded to be mythologized."  This reflects a changing attitude about the distinction between "fact" and "truth", expressed by [[Ursule Molinaro]] when he makes his [[Cassandra]] say, "I've come as close to the truth as facts would let me ... facts oppress the truth, which can breathe freely only in poetry &amp; art."{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=xvii}}

===Other media===
Many films have depicted historical figures.  Often the way in which the films interpret these figures and their times reflects the social and cultural values of the period in which the film was made.{{sfn|Landy|2001|p=1}}
Historical figures are familiar to the general reader and so may be used in [[speculative fiction]] so that readers marvel at their appearance in novel settings or with a fresh perspective.{{sfn|Jacobs|1990|p=111ff}}
For example, the time traveler [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|The Doctor]] has encountered numerous historical figures such as [[Marco Polo]] and [[Queen Elizabeth I]] in his adventures.{{sfn|Lawrence|Gee|2012}}
They appeared most frequently when the television series first started, as it was directed at children and the use of historical figures in historical settings was intended to be educational.{{sfn|Chapman|2006|p=19}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6200">'''Human milk oligosaccharides''' (HMO, also known as human milk glycans) are sugar molecules, that are part of the oligosaccharides group and which can be found in high concentrations exclusively in [[Breast milk|human breast milk]]. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;L. Bode: ''Human milk oligosaccharides: every baby needs a sugar mama.'' In: ''Glycobiology.'' Band 22, Nummer 9, September 2012, S.&amp;nbsp;1147–1162, {{DOI|10.1093/glycob/cws074}}, {{PMID|22513036}}, {{PMC|3406618}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
Human milk oligosaccharides form the third most abundant solid component ([[Solution|dissolved]] or [[Emulsion|emulsified]] or [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspended]] in water) of human milk after [[lactose]] and [[fat]].&lt;ref&gt;X. Chen: ''Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMOS): Structure, Function, and Enzyme-Catalyzed Synthesis.'' In: ''Advances in carbohydrate chemistry and biochemistry.'' Band 72, 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;113–190, {{DOI|10.1016/bs.accb.2015.08.002}}, {{PMID|26613816}}.&lt;/ref&gt; HMOs are present in a concentration of 0.35 - 0.88 oz / L. Approximately 200 structurally different human milk oligosaccharides are known. The composition of human milk oligosaccharides in breast milk is individual to each mother and varies over the [[Breastfeeding|period of lactation]]. The dominant oligosaccharide in 80% of all women is [[2'-Fucosyllactose|2'-fucosyllactose]], which is present in human breast milk at a concentration of approximately 0.088 oz/ L.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Katja Parschat, Bettina Gutiérrez|Periodical=[[dei – die ernährungsindustrie]]|Title=Fermentativ erzeugte humane Milch-Oligosaccharide wirken präbiotisch.|At=p.&amp;nbsp;38|Date=2016-11|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
In contrast to the other components of breast milk that are absorbed by the infant through breastfeeding, HMOs are [[Digestion|indigestible]] for the newborn child. However, they have a [[Prebiotic (nutrition)|prebiotic]] effect and serve as food for intestinal bacteria, especially [[Bifidobacterium|bifidobacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;K. Le Doare, B. Holder, A. Bassett, P. S. Pannaraj: ''Mother's Milk: A Purposeful Contribution to the Development of the Infant Microbiota and Immunity.'' In: ''Frontiers in immunology.'' Band 9, 2018, S.&amp;nbsp;361, {{DOI|10.3389/fimmu.2018.00361}}, {{PMID|29599768}}, {{PMC|5863526}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;The dominance of these intestinal bacteria in the gut reduces the colonization with [[Pathogen#Pathogenicity|pathogenic]] [[bacteria]] (probiosis) and thereby ensures a healthy [[Gut flora#Intestinal flora|intestinal flora]] (intestinal microbiome) and a reduced risk of dangerous intestinal infections.

Recent studies also suggest that HMOs significantly lower the risk of viral and bacterial [[Infection|infections]] and thus diminish the chance to get diarrhoea and respiratory diseases.

This protective function of the HMOs is activated when in contact with specific [[Pathogen|pathogens]], such as certain bacteria or [[Virus|viruses]]. These have the ability to bind themselves to the glycan [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptors]] (receptors for long chains of connected sugar molecules on the surface of human cells) located on the surface of the intestinal cells and can thereby infect the cells of the [[Intestinal epithelium|intestinal mucosa]]. Researchers have discovered that HMOs mimic these glycan receptors so the pathogens bind themselves to the HMOs rather than the intestinal cells. This reduces the risk of an infection with a pathogen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
In addition to this, HMOs seem to influence the reaction of specific cells of the [[immune system]] in a way that reduces [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] responses.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;D. S. Newburg, Y. He: ''Neonatal Gut Microbiota and Human Milk Glycans Cooperate to Attenuate Infection and Inflammation.'' In: ''Clinical obstetrics and gynecology.'' Band 58, Nummer 4, Dezember 2015, S.&amp;nbsp;814–826, {{DOI|10.1097/GRF.0000000000000156}}, {{PMID|26457857}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also suspected that HMOs reduce the risk of [[Preterm birth|premature infants]] becoming infected with the potentially life-threatening disease [[necrotizing enterocolitis]] (NEC).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Some of the [[Metabolite|metabolites]] directly affect the [[nervous system]] or the [[brain]] and can sometimes influence the development and behavior of children in the long term. There are studies that indicate certain HMOs supply the child with [[sialic acid]] residues. Sialic acid is an [[Nutrient#Essential nutrients|essential nutrient]] for the development of the child’s brain and mental abilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

HMOs are used as supplements in [[baby food]] to ensure a provision of babies that are not being breastfed with this important component of the human milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Surname1=Ralph Ammann|Periodical=European Dairy Magazine|Title=Achieving the impossible|At=pp.&amp;nbsp;30 f.|Date=2017-05|language=German
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution==
In experiments designed to test the suitability of HMOs as a prebiotic source of carbon for intestinal bacteria it was discovered that they are highly selective for a commensal bacteria known as ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|Bifidobacteria longum biovar infantis]]''. The presence of genes unique to ''[[Bifidobacterium longum|B. infantis]]'', including co-regulated glycosidases, and its efficiency at using HMOs as a carbon source may imply a co-evolution of HMOs and the genetic capability of select bacteria to utilize them.&lt;ref name="HMO-EVOLUTION"&gt;{{cite journal|last=German|first=JB|last2=Lebrilla|first2=CB|last3=Mills|first3=DA|date=18 Apr 2012|title=Human milk oligosaccharides: evolution, structures and bioselectivity as substrates for intestinal bacteria|journal=Nestle Nutr Workshop Ser Pediatr Program|series=Nestlé Nutrition Workshop Series: Pediatric Program|publisher=|volume=62|issue=|pages=205–22|doi=10.1159/000146322|isbn=978-3-8055-8553-8|pmc=2861563|pmid=18626202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Journal de Trévoux''''', formally the '''''Mémoires pour l'Histoire des Sciences &amp; des beaux-Arts''''', but often called the '''''Mémoires de Trévoux''''', was an influential [[academic journal]] that appeared monthly in France between January 1701 and December 1782. The journal published critical reviews of contemporary books and papers on a broad range of subjects, mostly non-fiction. Most of the authors were members of the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits), although they played down their connection with the order. However, when it came to questions of religion, morality or politics they did not attempt to remain neutral.{{sfn|ARTFL}}

==History==
The journal was established by [[Louis Auguste, Duke of Maine]] and ruler of the principality of [[Dombes]] to both discuss what was happening in the literary world and to stoutly defend the Catholic religion. He gave the job of editing the magazine to the Jesuits, and by 1702 it was appearing monthly.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=110}} For the first thirty years of its existence (1701–1731), the ''Journal de Trévoux'' was published at [[Trévoux]] (then the capital of Dombes, now a suburb of [[Lyon]]), in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Belley-Ars]].{{sfn|Goyau|1907}}

The Jesuit theologian and philosopher [[René-Joseph Tournemine]] (1661–1739) was the founding editor. He published his article ''Conjectures on the Union of the Soul and Body'' in the Journal in 1703, supporting the views of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]].{{sfn|Woolhouse|Francks|2006|p=246}} The journal was seen as biased in its discussions of politics and religion due to its association with the Jesuits.{{sfn|Percy|1826|p=152}} The ''Memoires de Trevoux'' inspired the launch of various rival journals, but none lasted for long.
In 1733 the Duke of Maine, tired of constant complaints, removed his protection from the editors. They moved to Paris, where they continued production until the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1762.{{sfn|Godefroy|1877|p=204}}

Among the contributing editors were [[Pierre Brumoy]], [[François Catrou]], one of the founding editors and one of the most prolific contributors for twelve years; [[Noël-Étienne Sanadon]], a translator of Horace and student of antiquity; and [[René-Joseph Tournemine]], a scholar whose nobility and purity of language was praised by Voltaire.{{sfn|Godefroy|1877|p=204}} The chief editor from 1737 to 1745 was P. de Charlevoix, formerly a missionary to Canada.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=110}} He was succeeded by [[Guillaume-François Berthier]], one of the authors of the multi-volume ''[[Histoire de l'église Gallicane]]'', who held the post until 1762 and did much to expand the circulation. The Jesuits were banished from France in 1762, and Berthier promptly resigned. Several other editors struggled to keep it running, but by 1777 it was down to 200 subscribers.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=111}} It was renamed ''Journal de Littérature, des Sciences et des Arts'', finally disappearing in 1782.

== Philosophy ==
The criticism in the journal was generally solid, intelligent, neutral and in good taste, written by educated men who avoided excess, even in their criticism of enemies such as [[Voltaire]]. The reviews were elegantly written, and maintained a cool and polite tone, generally avoiding personal attacks.{{sfn|Godefroy|1877|p=204}} Berthier generally stated his opinions calmly and clearly, giving a solid tone to the periodical that enhanced its authority. The magazine also covered scientific and technical subjects that were unrelated to the more radical political and social concepts of the time, giving an impression of independence from government pressure.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=111}} The journal supported a cosmopolitan view of culture as opposed to a narrow nationalistic one. It also took an enlightened view of science, including a belief in empiricism.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=114}}

However, the journal attacked the writings of the [[philosophes]] when they attacked religion.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=111}} The journal played up the evils that resulted from the beliefs of the philosophes, which would destroy public morality.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=112}} The journal took Catholic orthodoxy as received truth, treating religious writings with great respect.{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=113}} The ''Journal'' made personal attacks on the [[materialists]], whom it considered more dangerous even than the [[encyclopédistes]].{{sfn|Censer|1994|p=91}}

==History==
Lakeland traces its beginnings to German immigrants who, seeking a new life, traveled to America and settled in the Sheboygan area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/milwaukee/stories/2010/02/22/focus24.html|title=Lakeland College|last=|first=|date=21 February 2010|website=www.bizjournals.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here are some milestones in the college’s history:
* In 1862, the founders built Missionshaus (Mission House), a combined academy-college-seminary.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The school was called Mission House College and Seminary until 1956 when it adopted the name Lakeland College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fox11online.com/news/local/lakeshore/lakeland-college-to-be-called-lakeland-university|title=Lakeland College to be called Lakeland University|last=News|first=FOX 11|work=WLUK|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1956, the college adopted the name Lakeland and began focusing on a liberal arts education.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The seminary combined with the Yankton Theological School to become United Theological Seminary of the Twin Cities and relocated to Minneapolis/St. Paul in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wisconsinhistory.org/Records/Article/CS1773|title=Reformed Churches in Wisconsin {{!}} Wisconsin Historical Society|date=2012-08-03|work=Wisconsin Historical Society|access-date=2018-08-23|language=Sheboygan}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1978, Lakeland launched the state’s first degree-completion program for working adults by offering evening classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hngnews.com/sun_prairie_star/community/article_5f8032d0-f04e-5a7b-b7a7-7d449426148a.html|title=Lakeland College celebrates 30 years of adult education at Madison Center|work=Hometown News LP|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Lakeland’s Evening, Weekend &amp; Online program enrolls more than 2,000 graduate and undergraduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://issuu.com/lcmuskies/docs/lakeland-fall-2016|title=Lakeland Fall 2016|work=Issuu|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1991, Lakeland founded a campus in Tokyo, Japan and in 2005 it was recognized as an overseas campus, allowing it to sponsor visas for students.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* On July 1, 2016, Lakeland College became Lakeland University. This change resulted in the creation of three schools, a School of Business &amp; Entrepreneurship; a School of Science, Technology &amp; Education; and a School of Humanities and Fine Arts as well as new academic offerings. The change was fueled by many factors, including desire to increase international recruitment and clear up confusion with [[Lakeshore Technical College]], a neighboring institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://lakeland.edu/Lakeland-News/lakeland-college-to-become-lakeland-university-on-july-1|title=Lakeland College to become Lakeland University on July 1|website=lakeland.edu|access-date=2018-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Bolognini began using personal computers to generate flows of continuously expanding random images. In the 1990s, he programmed hundreds of these computers and left them to run ad infinitum (most of these are still working now). About his Programmed Machines he wrote: "I do not consider myself an artist who creates certain images, and I am not merely a conceptual artist. I am one whose machines have actually traced more lines than anyone else, covering boundless surfaces. I am not interested in the formal quality of the images produced by my installations but rather in their flow, their limitlessness in space and time, and the possibility of creating parallel universes of information made up of kilometres of images and infinite trajectories. My installations serve to generate out-of-control infinities."&lt;ref&gt;Maurizio Bolognini (2008), ''Postdigitale'', Rome: Carocci Editore, p. 34. See also Sandra Solimano (ed.) (2005), Maurizio Bolognini. Programmed Machines 1990-2005, Genoa: Villa Croce Museum of Contemporary Art, Neos, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Programmed Machines (and in particular the Sealed Computers, since 1992, whose monitor buses are closed with wax and whose graphic outputs cannot be displayed) &lt;ref&gt;"The complete inaccessibility of the vast quantity of visual imagery created by the work references a technological sublimity of the void beneath the digital world”, according to {{citation

}}, ch. 9: “Maurizio Bolognini revises the very notion of a digital device to encompass  hardware, software ''and the public''. Postdigital artists see digital devices as enmeshed in social processes and patterns.  […] New modes of participation offer a variety of possibilities for digital art in which there is a shift from weak modes of public interaction to stronger modes that promote democracy and public decision-making.  To be sure, digital art in the future will utilize participatory technologies and mobile communications to a greater extent.”&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==

The ''MicrOmega'' [[mnemonic]] is derived from its French name ''Micro observatoire pour la mineralogie, l'eau, les glaces et l'activité'';&lt;ref name="Astro2017"/&gt; IR stands for [[infrared]].  It was developed by France's ''Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale'' at the [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique|CNRS]]. France has also flown MicrOmega on other missions such as the 2011 [[Fobos-Grunt]] and the ''[[Hayabusa2]]'' MASCOT mobile lander currently exploring [[162173 Ryugu|asteroid Ryugu]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://mascot.cnes.fr/en/MASCOT/GP_micromega.htm MicroMega Instrument for MASCOT]. [[CNES]], France. August 26, 2016. Accessed: 21 July 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; France is also developing a variant called MacrOmega Near-IR Spectrometer for the [[Martian Moons Exploration]] (MMX) lander, a Japanese [[sample-return mission]] to Mars' moon [[Phobos (moon)|Phobos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isas.jaxa.jp/en/topics/files/MMX170412_EN.pdf#page=19 Martian Moons eXploration (MMX) Mission Overview]. (PDF). [[JAXA]]. 10 April 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Principal Investigator]] of the MicrOmega-IR for the ExoMars rover is Jean-Pierre Bibring, a French astronomer and planetary scientist at the ''Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale''. Co-PIs are astrobiologists Frances Westall and Nicolas Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploration.esa.int/mars/45103-rover-instruments/ The ExoMars Rover Instrument Suite - MicrOmega].

MicrOmega-IR is a visible and [[Hyperspectral imaging|infrared hyperspectral microscope]] that is designed to characterize the texture and composition of crushed samples presented to the instrument.&lt;ref name='Bibring 2017'&gt;[https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/ast.2016.1642 The MicrOmega Investigation Onboard ExoMars].

''Astrobiology'', Vol. 17, No. 6-7. 1 July 2017. {{doi|10.1089/ast.2016.1642}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its objective is to study mineral grain assemblages in detail to try to unravel their geological origin, structure and composition, including potential [[Organic compound|organics]].&lt;ref name='Bibring 2017'/&gt; These data will be vital for interpreting past and present geological processes and environments on Mars. Because MicrOmega-IR is an imaging instrument, it can also be used to identify grains that are particularly interesting, and assign them as targets for [[ExoMars (rover)#Pasteur instrument suite|Raman]] and [[Mars Organic Molecule Analyzer|MOMA]] observations.&lt;ref name='Bibring 2017'/&gt; 

It is composed of 2 microscopes: MicrOmega/VIS has a spatial sampling of approximately 4 μm, working in 4 colors in the visible range. The other one is the MicrOmega/NIR hyperspectral microscope working in the spectral range 0.95 μm - 3.65 μm with a spatial sampling of 20 μm per pixel.&lt;ref name=SciDir&gt;[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0032063309000026 Micromega/IR: Design and status of a near-infrared spectral microscope for in situ analysis of Mars samples].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4129">[[File:Nasothek-2.jpg|thumb|Nasothek displaying marble body parts once used to "repair" antique statuary.]]A '''nasothek''' (from the Latin ''{{lang|la|nasus}}'' "nose" and Greek {{lang|grc|θήκη}} "container") is a collection of sculpted noses. 

==Carlsberg display of restoration noses==
The [[Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek]] museum in Copenhagen has a nasothek collection that displays restored noses that were removed from portrait busts and statues after changes in the museum's [[art restoration]] policies.&lt;ref name=Huizing&gt;{{cite book|title=Klinik der menschlichen Sinne|year=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-211-76632-3|pages=66|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XaOg_nkDQR0C|author=E.H. Huizing|chapter=The Nose and Beyond—No Nose|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=restor&gt;{{cite book|title=History of restoration of ancient stone sculptures|year=2003|publisher=Getty Publications|isbn=978-0-89236-723-8|pages=207–224|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZNAVlaA6FuUC|author=Mette Moltesen|editor=Janet Burnett Grossman|chapter=Fifty years of restoration work in the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The noses, some made of marble and others of plaster, were all originally exhibited on the Greek and Roman statues in the glyptotek itself.&lt;ref&gt;Sign in Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek under its nasothek display&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nasothek.JPG|thumb|left|Detail: A closer look at the Copenhagen Nasothek display shows wide variety in surface textures and style.]]The [[Marble#Sculpture|white marble]] favored by Classical sculptors is easily broken, and many antique statues have been damaged since their creation by accidents, [[iconoclasm]], or vandalism. During the 19th century, it was common practice for museums to exhibit such marble sculptures in a "restored" state, with damaged parts repaired or reconstructed to make the statue look as much as possible as it did when it was first created. The noses of antique statues are especially likely to be damaged or missing, so many Greek or Roman statues acquired new noses during this era. Modern exhibition practice may differ from museum to museum. The minimalist approach prescribes removing such 19th-century additions in the interest of authenticity, as has been done in Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=Getty&gt;{{cite web|title=Getty Exhibition Spotlights Practices In Antiquities Conservation|url=http://www.getty.edu/news/press/center/hope_hygieia_release_040208.html|publisher=J. Paul Getty Museum|accessdate=18 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ny Carlsberg museum, which has an extensive collection of Greek and Roman marble statues,  participated both in 19th-century restoration and in 20th-century "de-restoration." As a result, many Roman portrait heads are now noseless again, with their restored noses removed to the museum's nasothek.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

The museum display explains its contents in both Danish and English. The English description says, "The word ''nasothek'' means a collection of noses, in analogy with ''{{linktext|discotheque}}'', a collection of records."&lt;ref name=restor/&gt; The Danish explanation compares "nasotek" (Danish equivalent of "nasothek") to "{{linktext|bibliotek}}", a collection of books.&lt;ref name=restor/&gt;

}}

'''Natural science''' is a [[Branches of science|branch of science]] concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of [[Phenomenon|natural phenomena]], based on [[empirical evidence]] from [[observation]] and [[experimentation]]. Mechanisms such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.

Natural science can be divided into two main branches: [[list of life sciences|life science]] (or biological science) and [[Outline of physical science|physical science]]. Physical science is subdivided into branches, including [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[astronomy]] and [[earth science]]. These branches of natural science may be further divided into more specialized branches (also known as fields).

In Western society's [[analytic tradition]], the empirical sciences and especially natural sciences use tools from [[formal science]]s, such as mathematics and logic, converting information about nature into measurements which can be explained as clear statements of the "[[laws of science|laws of nature]]". The [[social science]]s also use such methods, but rely more on [[qualitative research]], so that they are sometimes called "[[soft science]]", whereas natural sciences, insofar as they emphasize [[quantification (science)|quantifiable]] data produced, tested, and confirmed through the [[scientific method]], are sometimes called "[[hard science]]".{{sfn|Lagemaat|2006|p=283}}

Modern natural science succeeded more classical approaches to [[natural philosophy]], usually traced to [[ancient Greece]]. [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] debated the benefits of using approaches which were more [[mathematical physics|mathematical]] and more experimental in a methodical way. Still, philosophical perspectives, [[conjecture]]s, and [[presupposition]]s, often overlooked, remain necessary in natural science.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh G Gauch Jr, ''Scientific Method in Practice'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), [https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71#v=twopage pp 71–73] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906160524/https://books.google.com/books?id=iVkugqNG9dAC&amp;pg=PA71 |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Systematic data collection, including [[discovery science]], succeeded [[natural history]], which emerged in the 16th century by describing and classifying plants, animals, minerals, and so on.{{sfn|Oglivie|2008|pp=1–2}} Today, "natural history" suggests observational descriptions aimed at popular audiences.&lt;ref name="Wordnet definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Natural History|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|publisher=Princeton University WordNet|accessdate=October 21, 2012|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303173506/http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=natural+history|archivedate=March 3, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criteria==
{{main|Philosophy of science}}
Philosophers of science have suggested a number of criteria, including [[Karl Popper]]'s controversial [[falsifiability]] criterion, to help them differentiate scientific endeavors from non-scientific ones. [[Validity (statistics)|Validity]], [[accuracy]], and [[quality control]], such as [[peer review]] and repeatability of findings, are amongst the most respected criteria in the present-day global scientific community.

===Biology===
{{Main|Biology|Outline of biology#Branches of biology}}
[[File:Wilson1900Fig2.jpg|thumb|Onion (''[[Allium]]'') cells in different phases of the cell cycle. Growth in an '[[organism]]' is carefully controlled by regulating the cell cycle.]]
This field encompasses a set of disciplines that examines phenomena related to living organisms. The scale of study can range from sub-component [[biophysics]] up to complex [[ecology|ecologies]]. Biology is concerned with the characteristics, [[scientific classification|classification]] and [[behaviors]] of [[organism]]s, as well as how [[species]] were formed and their interactions with each other and the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].

The biological fields of [[botany]], [[zoology]], and [[medicine]] date back to early periods of civilization, while [[microbiology]] was introduced in the 17th century with the invention of the microscope. However, it was not until the 19th century that biology became a unified science. Once scientists discovered commonalities between all living things, it was decided they were best studied as a whole.

Some key developments in biology were the discovery of [[genetics]]; [[evolution]] through [[natural selection]]; the [[germ theory of disease]] and the application of the techniques of [[biochemistry|chemistry]] and [[biophysics|physics]] at the level of the [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organic molecule]].

Modern biology is divided into subdisciplines by the type of organism and by the scale being studied. [[Molecular biology]] is the study of the fundamental chemistry of life, while [[cellular biology]] is the examination of the cell; the basic building block of all life. At a higher level, [[anatomy]] and [[physiology]] looks at the internal structures, and their functions, of an organism, while [[ecology]] looks at how various organisms interrelate.

===Chemistry===
{{Main|Chemistry|Outline of chemistry#Branches of chemistry}}
[[File:Caffeine.svg|thumb|This [[structural formula]] for molecule [[caffeine]] shows a graphical representation of how the atoms are arranged.]]
Constituting the scientific study of matter at the [[atom]]ic and [[molecule|molecular]] scale, chemistry deals primarily with collections of atoms, such as [[gas]]es, molecules, [[crystal]]s, and [[metal]]s. The composition, statistical properties, transformations and reactions of these materials are studied. Chemistry also involves understanding the properties and interactions of individual atoms and molecules for use in larger-scale applications.

Most chemical processes can be studied directly in a laboratory, using a series of (often well-tested) techniques for manipulating materials, as well as an understanding of the underlying processes. Chemistry is often called "[[the central science]]" because of its role in connecting the other natural sciences.

Early experiments in chemistry had their roots in the system of [[Alchemy]], a set of beliefs combining mysticism with physical experiments. The science of chemistry began to develop with the work of [[Robert Boyle]], the discoverer of gas, and [[Antoine Lavoisier]], who developed the theory of the [[Conservation of mass]].

The [[Discoveries of the chemical elements|discovery of the chemical elements]] and [[atomic theory]] began to systematize this science, and researchers developed a fundamental understanding of [[State of matter|states of matter]], [[ion]]s, [[chemical bond]]s and [[chemical reaction]]s. The success of this science led to a complementary [[chemical industry]] that now plays a significant role in the world economy.

===Physics===
{{Main|Physics|Outline of physics#Branches of physics}}
[[File:HAtomOrbitals.png|thumb|The [[Atomic orbital|orbitals]] of the [[hydrogen atom]] are descriptions of the [[probability distribution]]s of an [[electron]] [[bound state|bound]] to a [[proton]]. Their mathematical descriptions are standard problems in [[quantum mechanics]], an important branch of physics.]]
Physics embodies the study of the fundamental constituents of the [[universe]], the [[forces]] and interactions they exert on one another, and the results produced by these interactions. In general, physics is regarded as the fundamental science, because all other natural sciences use and obey the principles and laws set down by the field. Physics relies heavily on [[mathematics]] as the logical framework for formulation and quantification of principles.

The study of the principles of the universe has a long history and largely derives from direct observation and experimentation. The formulation of theories about the governing laws of the universe has been central to the study of physics from very early on, with [[philosophy]] gradually yielding to systematic, quantitative experimental testing and observation as the source of verification. Key historical developments in physics include [[Isaac Newton]]'s [[Law of universal gravitation|theory of universal gravitation]] and [[classical mechanics]], an understanding of [[electricity]] and its relation to [[magnetism]], [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s theories of [[special relativity|special]] and [[general relativity]], the development of [[thermodynamics]], and the [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] model of atomic and [[subatomic physics]].

The field of physics is extremely broad, and can include such diverse studies as [[quantum mechanics]] and [[theoretical physics]], [[applied physics]] and [[optics]]. Modern physics is becoming increasingly specialized, where researchers tend to focus on a particular area rather than being "universalists" like [[Isaac Newton]], [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Lev Landau]], who worked in multiple areas.

===Astronomy===
{{Main|Astronomy|Outline of astronomy#Branches of astronomy}}
[[File:Moon Dedal crater.jpg|thumb|Unmanned and manned spacecraft missions have been used to image distant locations within the [[Solar System]], such as this ''[[Apollo 11]]'' view of [[Daedalus (crater)|Daedalus crater]] on the [[far side of the Moon]].]]
This discipline is the science of [[Astronomical object|celestial objects]] and [[phenomenon|phenomena]] that originate outside the [[Atmosphere of Earth|Earth's atmosphere]]. It is concerned with the evolution, [[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[meteorology]], and [[motion (physics)|motion]] of celestial objects, as well as the [[physical cosmology|formation and development of the universe]].

Astronomy includes the examination, study and modeling of [[star]]s, [[planet]]s, [[comet]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]] and the [[cosmos]]. Most of the information used by astronomers is gathered by remote observation, although some laboratory reproduction of celestial phenomena has been performed (such as the molecular chemistry of the [[interstellar medium]]).

While the origins of the study of celestial features and phenomena can be traced back to antiquity, the scientific methodology of this field began to develop in the middle of the 17th century. A key factor was [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]]'s introduction of the telescope to examine the night sky in more detail.

The mathematical treatment of astronomy began with [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s development of [[celestial mechanics]] and the laws of [[gravitation]], although it was triggered by earlier work of astronomers such as [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]]. By the 19th century, astronomy had developed into a formal science, with the introduction of instruments such as the [[spectroscope]] and [[photography]], along with much-improved telescopes and the creation of professional observatories.

===Earth science===
{{Main article|Earth science|Outline of Earth sciences#Branches of Earth science}}
Earth science (also known as geoscience), is an all-embracing term for the sciences related to the planet [[Earth (planet)|Earth]], including [[geology]], [[geophysics]], [[hydrology]], [[meteorology]], [[physical geography]], [[oceanography]], and [[soil science]].

Although [[mining]] and [[gemology|precious stones]] have been human interests throughout the history of civilization, the development of the related sciences of [[economic geology]] and [[mineralogy]] did not occur until the 18th century. The study of the earth, particularly [[palaeontology]], blossomed in the 19th century. The growth of other disciplines, such as [[geophysics]], in the 20th century led to the development of the theory of [[plate tectonic]]s in the 1960s, which has had a similar effect on the Earth sciences as the theory of evolution had on biology. Earth sciences today are closely linked to [[petroleum]] and [[mineral resource]]s, [[climate]] research and to [[environmental assessment]] and [[environmental remediation|remediation]].

====Atmospheric sciences====
{{Main article|Atmospheric sciences}}
Though sometimes considered in conjunction with the earth sciences, due to the independent development of its concepts, techniques and practices and also the fact of it having a wide range of sub disciplines under its wing, the [[atmospheric sciences]] is also considered a separate branch of natural science. This field studies the characteristics of different layers of the atmosphere from ground level to the edge of the time. The timescale of study also varies from days to centuries. Sometimes the field also includes the study of climatic patterns on planets other than earth.

====Oceanography====
{{Main article|Oceanography}}
The serious study of oceans began in the early to mid-20th century. As a field of natural science, it is relatively young but stand-alone programs offer specializations in the subject. Though some controversies remain as to the categorization of the field under earth sciences, interdisciplinary sciences or as a separate field in its own right, most modern workers in the field agree that it has matured to a state that it has its own paradigms and practices. As such a big family of related studies spanning every aspect of the oceans is now classified under this field.

==Interdisciplinary studies==
The distinctions between the natural science disciplines are not always sharp, and they share a number of cross-discipline fields. Physics plays a significant role in the other natural sciences, as represented by [[astrophysics]], [[geophysics]], [[chemical physics]] and [[biophysics]]. Likewise chemistry is represented by such fields as [[biochemistry]], [[chemical biology]], [[geochemistry]] and [[astrochemistry]].

A particular example of a scientific discipline that draws upon multiple natural sciences is [[environmental science]]. This field studies the interactions of physical, chemical, geological, and [[biological components]] of the [[environment (biophysical)|environment]], with a particular regard to the effect of human activities and the impact on [[biodiversity]] and [[sustainability]]. This science also draws upon expertise from other fields such as economics, law and social sciences.

A comparable discipline is [[oceanography]], as it draws upon a similar breadth of scientific disciplines. Oceanography is sub-categorized into more specialized cross-disciplines, such as [[physical oceanography]] and [[marine biology]]. As the [[marine ecosystem]] is very large and diverse, marine biology is further divided into many subfields, including specializations in particular [[species]].

There are also a subset of cross-disciplinary fields which, by the nature of the problems that they address, have strong currents that run counter to
specialization. Put another way: In some fields of integrative application, specialists in more than one field are a key part of most dialog. Such integrative fields, for example, include [[nanoscience]], [[astrobiology]], and [[complex system]] [[Informatics (academic field)|informatics]].

===Materials science===
{{Main|Materials science}}
[[File:Materials science tetrahedron;structure, processing, performance, and proprerties.svg|thumb|The materials paradigm represented as a tetrahedron]]
Materials science is a relatively new, interdisciplinary field which deals with the study of [[matter]] and its properties; as well as the discovery and design of new materials. Originally developed through the field of [[metallurgy]], the study of the properties of materials and solids has now expanded into all materials. The field covers the chemistry, physics and engineering applications of materials including metals, ceramics, artificial polymers, and many others. The core of the field deals with relating structure of material with it properties.

It is at the forefront of research in science and engineering. It is an important part of [[forensic engineering]] (the investigation of materials, products, structures or components that fail or do not operate or function as intended, causing personal injury or damage to property) and [[failure analysis]], the latter being the key to understanding, for example, the cause of various aviation accidents. Many of the most pressing scientific problems that are faced today are due to the limitations of the materials that are available and, as a result, breakthroughs in this field are likely to have a significant impact on the future of technology.

The basis of materials science involves studying the structure of materials, and relating them to their [[property|properties]]. Once a materials scientist knows about this structure-property correlation, they can then go on to study the relative performance of a material in a certain application. The major determinants of the structure of a material and thus of its properties are its constituent chemical elements and the way in which it has been processed into its final form. These characteristics, taken together and related through the laws of [[thermodynamics]] and [[kinetics (physics)|kinetics]], govern a material's [[microstructure]], and thus its properties.

Some scholars trace the origins of natural science as far back as pre-literate human societies, where understanding the natural world was necessary for survival.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} People observed and built up knowledge about the behavior of animals and the usefulness of plants as food and medicine, which was passed down from generation to generation.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=1}} These primitive understandings gave way to more formalized inquiry around 3500 to 3000 BC in the [[Mesopotamia]]n and [[Ancient Egypt]]ian cultures, which produced the first known written evidence of [[natural philosophy]], the precursor of natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=2}} While the writings show an interest in astronomy, mathematics and other aspects of the physical world, the ultimate aim of inquiry about nature's workings was in all cases religious or mythological, not scientific.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=2–3}}

A tradition of scientific inquiry also emerged in [[Ancient China]], where [[Taoism|Taoist]] [[alchemy|alchemists]] and philosophers experimented with elixirs to [[life extension|extend life]] and cure ailments.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=3}} They focused on the [[yin and yang]], or contrasting elements in nature; the yin was associated with femininity and coldness, while yang was associated with masculinity and warmth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|pp=3–4}} The five phases – fire, earth, metal, wood and water – described a cycle of transformations in nature. Water turned into wood, which turned into fire when it burned. The ashes left by fire were earth.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=4}} Using these principles, Chinese philosophers and doctors explored human anatomy, characterizing organs as predominantly yin or yang and understood the relationship between the pulse, the heart and the flow of blood in the body centuries before it became accepted in the West.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

Little evidence survives of how [[Ancient India]]n cultures around the [[Indus River]] understood nature, but some of their perspectives may be reflected in the [[Vedas]], a set of sacred [[Hinduism|Hindu]] texts.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} They reveal a conception of the universe as ever-expanding and constantly being recycled and reformed.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Surgeons in the [[Ayurvedic]] tradition saw health and illness as a combination of three humors: [[wind]], [[bile]] and [[phlegm]].{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} A healthy life was the result of a balance among these humors.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} In Ayurvedic thought, the body consisted of five elements: earth, water, fire, wind and empty space.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}} Ayurvedic surgeons performed complex surgeries and developed a detailed understanding of human anatomy.{{sfn|Magner|2002|p=5}}

[[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic]] philosophers in [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] culture brought natural philosophy a step closer to direct inquiry about cause and effect in nature between 600 and 400 BC, although an element of magic and mythology remained.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} Natural phenomena such as earthquakes and eclipses were explained increasingly in the context of nature itself instead of being attributed to angry gods.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=8}} [[Thales|Thales of Miletus]], an early philosopher who lived from 625 to 546 BC, explained earthquakes by theorizing that the world floated on water and that water was the fundamental element in nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=2}} In the 5th century BC, [[Leucippus]] was an early exponent of [[atomism]], the idea that the world is made up of fundamental indivisible particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}} [[Pythagoras]] applied Greek innovations in mathematics to astronomy, and suggested that the earth was [[sphere|spherical]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=3}}

===Aristotelian natural philosophy (400 BC–1100 AD)===
[[File:Aristotle's model of Inheritance.png|thumb|upright=1.3|left|Aristotle's view of inheritance, as a model of the transmission of patterns of movement of the body fluids from parents to child, and of [[Hylomorphism|Aristotelian form]] from the father.]]
{{further|Aristotle's biology}}

Later [[Socrates|Socratic]] and [[Plato]]nic thought focused on ethics, morals and art and did not attempt an investigation of the physical world; Plato criticized pre-Socratic thinkers as materialists and anti-religionists.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=21–22}} [[Aristotle]], however, a student of Plato who lived from 384 to 322 BC, paid closer attention to the natural world in his philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=27–28}} In his ''[[History of Animals]]'', he described the inner workings of 110 species, including the [[stingray]], [[catfish]] and [[bee]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=33–34}} He investigated chick embryos by breaking open eggs and observing them at various stages of development.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=34}} Aristotle's works were influential through the 16th century, and he is considered to be the [[Aristotle's biology|father of biology for his pioneering work in that science]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=34–35}} He also presented philosophies about physics, nature and astronomy using [[inductive reasoning]] in his works ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Meteorology (Aristotle)|Meteorology]]''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=37–39, 53}}

[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|upright|Plato (left) and Aristotle in [[The School of Athens|a 1509 painting]] by [[Raphael]]. Plato rejected inquiry into natural philosophy as against religion, while his student, Aristotle, created a body of work on the natural world that influenced generations of scholars.]]

While Aristotle considered natural philosophy more seriously than his predecessors, he approached it as a theoretical branch of science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=52}} Still, inspired by his work, [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]]  philosophers of the early 1st century AD, including [[Lucretius]], [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]] and [[Pliny the Elder]], wrote treatises that dealt with the rules of the natural world in varying degrees of depth.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=95}} Many [[Ancient Rome|Ancient Roman]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]] of the 3rd to the 6th centuries also adapted Aristotle's teachings on the physical world to a philosophy that emphasized spiritualism.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=54, 59}} Early [[medieval]] philosophers including [[Macrobius]], [[Calcidius]] and [[Martianus Capella]] also examined the physical world, largely from a cosmological and [[cosmography|cosmographical]] perspective, putting forth theories on the arrangement of celestial bodies and the heavens, which were posited as being composed of [[aether (classical element)|aether]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=103}}

Aristotle's works on natural philosophy continued to be translated and studied amid the rise of the [[Byzantine Empire]] and [[Abbasid Caliphate]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=61–66}} 

In the Byzantine Empire [[John Philoponus]], an Alexandrian Aristotelian commentator and Christian theologian, was the first who questioned Aristotle's teaching of physics. Unlike Aristotle who based his physics on verbal argument, Philoponus instead relied on observation, and argued for observation rather than resorting into verbal argument.&lt;ref&gt;http://homepages.wmich.edu/~mcgrew/philfall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the [[theory of impetus]]. John Philoponus' criticism of Aristotelian principles of physics served as inspiration for Galileo Galilei during the [[Scientific Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/philoponus/|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|first=Christian|last=Wildberg|editor-first=Edward N.|editor-last=Zalta|date=8 March 2018|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|via=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindberg, David. (1992) ''The Beginnings of Western Science''. University of Chicago Press. Page 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

A revival in mathematics and science took place during the time of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] from the 9th century onward, when Muslim scholars expanded upon Greek and [[India]]n natural philosophy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=11}} The words ''[[alcohol]]'', ''[[algebra]]'' and ''[[zenith]]'' all have [[Arabic]] roots.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=11–12}}

===Medieval natural philosophy (1100–1600)===
{{also|Renaissance of the 12th century}}
Aristotle's works and other Greek natural philosophy did not reach the West until about the middle of the 12th century, when works were translated from [[Greek people|Greek]] and Arabic into [[Latin]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=95, 130}} The development of European civilization later in the Middle Ages brought with it further advances in natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=106}} European inventions such as the [[horseshoe]], [[horse collar]] and [[crop rotation]] allowed for rapid population growth, eventually giving way to urbanization and the foundation of schools connected to monasteries and cathedrals in modern-day [[France]] and [[England]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=106–107}} Aided by the schools, an approach to Christian [[theology]] developed that sought to answer questions about nature and other subjects using logic.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} This approach, however, was seen by some detractors as [[heresy]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=115}} By the 12th century, Western European scholars and philosophers came into contact with a body of knowledge of which they had previously been ignorant: a large corpus of works in Greek and Arabic that were preserved by Islamic scholars.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} Through translation into Latin, Western Europe was introduced to Aristotle and his natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=130}} These works were taught at new universities in [[Paris]] and [[Oxford]] by the early 13th century, although the practice was frowned upon by the Catholic church.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}} A 1210 decree from the [[Synod]] of Paris ordered that "no lectures are to be held in Paris either publicly or privately using Aristotle's books on natural philosophy or the commentaries, and we forbid all this under pain of excommunication."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=143}}

In the late Middle Ages, [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher [[Dominicus Gundissalinus]] translated a treatise by the earlier Persian scholar [[Al-Farabi]] called ''On the Sciences'' into Latin, calling the study of the mechanics of nature ''scientia naturalis'', or natural science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus also proposed his own classification of the natural sciences in his 1150 work ''On the Division of Philosophy''.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} This was the first detailed classification of the sciences based on Greek and Arab philosophy to reach Western Europe.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=155}} Gundissalinus defined natural science as "the science considering only things unabstracted and with motion," as opposed to mathematics and sciences that rely on mathematics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}} Following Al-Farabi, he then separated the sciences into eight parts, including physics, cosmology, meteorology, minerals science and plant and animal science.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=156}}

Later philosophers made their own classifications of the natural sciences. [[Robert Kilwardby]] wrote ''On the Order of the Sciences'' in the 13th century that classed medicine as a mechanical science, along with agriculture, hunting and theater while defining natural science as the science that deals with bodies in motion.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=156–157}} [[Roger Bacon]], an English friar and philosopher, wrote that natural science dealt with "a principle of motion and rest, as in the parts of the elements of fire, air, earth and water, and in all inanimate things made from them."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} These sciences also covered plants, animals and celestial bodies.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=158}} Later in the 13th century, Catholic priest and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]] defined natural science as dealing with "mobile beings" and  "things which depend on matter not only for their existence, but also for their definition."{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=159–163}} There was wide agreement among scholars in medieval times that natural science was about bodies in motion, although there was division about the inclusion of fields including medicine, music and perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=234}} Philosophers pondered questions including the existence of a vacuum, whether motion could produce heat, the colors of rainbows, the motion of the earth, whether elemental chemicals exist and where in the atmosphere rain is formed.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=236–237}}

In the centuries up through the end of the Middle Ages, natural science was often mingled with philosophies about magic and the occult.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=170–178}} Natural philosophy appeared in a wide range of forms, from treatises to encyclopedias to commentaries on Aristotle.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=189–190}} The interaction between natural philosophy and [[Christianity]] was complex during this period; some early theologians, including [[Tatian]] and [[Eusebius]], considered natural philosophy an outcropping of pagan Greek science and were suspicious of it.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=239–240}} Although some later Christian philosophers, including Aquinas, came to see natural science as a means of interpreting scripture, this suspicion persisted until the 12th and 13th centuries.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=241–243}} The [[Condemnations of 1210–1277|Condemnation of 1277]], which forbade setting philosophy on a level equal with theology and the debate of religious constructs in a scientific context, showed the persistence with which Catholic leaders resisted the development of natural philosophy even from a theological perspective.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=246–247}} Aquinas and [[Albertus Magnus]], another Catholic theologian of the era, sought to distance theology from science in their works.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=251}} "I don't see what one's interpretation of Aristotle has to do with the teaching of the faith," he wrote in 1271.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=252}}

===Newton and the scientific revolution (1600–1800)===
By the 16th and 17th centuries, natural philosophy underwent an evolution beyond commentary on Aristotle as more early Greek philosophy was uncovered and translated.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} The invention of the printing press in the 15th century, the invention of the microscope and telescope, and the [[Protestant Reformation]] fundamentally altered the social context in which scientific inquiry evolved in the West.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274}} [[Christopher Columbus]]'s discovery of a new world changed perceptions about the physical makeup of the world, while observations by [[Copernicus]], [[Tyco Brahe]] and [[Galileo]] brought a more accurate picture of the solar system as [[heliocentric]] and proved many of Aristotle's theories about the heavenly bodies false.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=274–275}} A number of 17th-century philosophers, including [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[John Locke]] and [[Francis Bacon]] made a break from the past by rejecting Aristotle and his medieval followers outright, calling their approach to natural philosophy as superficial.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=276–277}}

The titles of Galileo's work ''Two New Sciences'' and [[Johannes Kepler]]'s ''New Astronomy'' underscored the atmosphere of change that took hold in the 17th century as Aristotle was dismissed in favor of novel methods of inquiry into the natural world.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon was instrumental in popularizing this change; he argued that people should use the arts and sciences to gain dominion over nature.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=278–279}} To achieve this, he wrote that "human life [must] be endowed with new discoveries and powers."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} He defined natural philosophy as "the knowledge of Causes and secret motions of things; and enlarging the bounds of Human Empire, to the effecting of all things possible."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=278}} Bacon proposed scientific inquiry supported by the state and fed by the collaborative research of scientists, a vision that was unprecedented in its scope, ambition and form at the time.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=279}} Natural philosophers came to view nature increasingly as a mechanism that could be taken apart and understood, much like a complex clock.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–285}} Natural philosophers including [[Isaac Newton]], [[Evangelista Torricelli]] and [[Francesco Redi]] conducted experiments focusing on the flow of water, measuring [[atmospheric pressure]] using a [[barometer]] and disproving [[spontaneous generation]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–290}} Scientific societies and scientific journals emerged and were spread widely through the printing press, touching off the [[scientific revolution]].{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=280–295}} Newton in 1687 published his ''The Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy'', or ''Principia Mathematica'', which set the groundwork for physical laws that remained current until the 19th century.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=304–306}}

Some modern scholars, including Andrew Cunningham, Perry Williams and [[Floris Cohen]], argue that natural philosophy is not properly called a science, and that genuine scientific inquiry began only with the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} According to Cohen, "the emancipation of science from an overarching entity called 'natural philosophy' is one defining characteristic of the Scientific Revolution."{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Other historians of science, including [[Edward Grant]], contend that the scientific revolution that blossomed in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries occurred when principles learned in the exact sciences of optics, mechanics and astronomy began to be applied to questions raised by natural philosophy.{{sfn|Grant|2007|p=307}} Grant argues that Newton attempted to expose the mathematical basis of nature – the immutable rules it obeyed – and in doing so joined natural philosophy and mathematics for the first time, producing an early work of modern physics.{{sfn|Grant|2007|pp=317–318}}

[[File:Sir Isaac Newton (1643-1727).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Isaac Newton]] is widely regarded as one of the most influential scientists of all time.]]
The scientific revolution, which began to take hold in the 17th century, represented a sharp break from Aristotelian modes of inquiry.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}} One of its principal advances was the use of the [[scientific method]] to investigate nature. Data was collected and [[repeatability|repeatable]] measurements made in [[experiment]]s.{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=26–27}} Scientists then formed [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] to explain the results of these experiments.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The hypothesis was then tested using the principle of [[falsifiability]] to prove or disprove its accuracy.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=27}} The natural sciences continued to be called natural philosophy, but the adoption of the scientific method took science beyond the realm of philosophical conjecture and introduced a more structured way of examining nature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=26}}

Newton, an English mathematician and physicist, was the seminal figure in the scientific revolution.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=33}} Drawing on advances made in astronomy by Copernicus, Brahe and Kepler, Newton derived the [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal law of gravitation]] and [[Newton's laws of motion|laws of motion]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|pp=33–35}} These laws applied both on earth and in outer space, uniting two spheres of the physical world previously thought to function independently of each other, according to separate physical rules.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=35}} Newton, for example, showed that the [[tide]]s were caused by the gravitational pull of the [[moon]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=36}} Another of Newton's advances was to make mathematics a powerful explanatory tool for natural phenomena.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}} While natural philosophers had long used mathematics as a means of measurement and analysis, its principles were not used as a means of understanding cause and effect in nature until Newton.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=37}}

In the 18th century and 19th century, scientists including [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb]], [[Alessandro Volta]], and [[Michael Faraday]] built upon Newtonian mechanics by exploring [[electromagnetism]], or the interplay of forces with positive and negative charges on [[electric charge|electrically charged]] particles.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Faraday proposed that forces in nature operated in "[[Field (physics)|fields]]" that filled space.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} The idea of fields contrasted with the Newtonian construct of gravitation as simply "action at a distance", or the attraction of objects with nothing in the space between them to intervene.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 19th century unified these discoveries in a coherent [[Maxwell's equations|theory of electrodynamics]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}} Using mathematical equations and experimentation, Maxwell discovered that space was filled with charged particles that could act upon themselves and each other, and that they were a medium for the transmission of charged waves.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=48}}

Significant advances in chemistry also took place during the scientific revolution. [[Antoine Lavoisier]], a French chemist, refuted the [[phlogiston theory]], which posited that things burned by releasing "phlogiston" into the air.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} [[Joseph Priestley]] had discovered [[oxygen]] in the 18th century, but Lavoisier discovered that [[combustion]] was the result of [[oxidation]].{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} He also constructed a table of 33 elements and invented modern chemical nomenclature.{{sfn|Barr|2006|p=49}} Formal biological science remained in its infancy in the 18th century, when the focus lay upon the [[Scientific classification|classification and categorization]] of natural life. This growth in [[natural history]] was led by [[Carl Linnaeus]], whose 1735 [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the natural world is still in use. Linnaeus in the 1750s introduced [[Binomial nomenclature|scientific names]] for all his species.{{sfn|Mayr|1982|pp=171–179}}

===19th-century developments (1800–1900)===
[[File:Michelson-Morley experiment (en).svg|thumb|The [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] was used to disprove that light propagated through a [[luminiferous aether]]. This 19th-century concept was then superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]].]]

By the 19th century, the study of science had come into the purview of professionals and institutions. In so doing, it gradually acquired the more modern name of ''natural science.'' The term ''scientist'' was coined by [[William Whewell]] in an 1834 review of [[Mary Somerville]]'s ''On the Connexion of the Sciences''.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book |last1= Holmes|first1= R|title= The age of wonder: How the romantic generation discovered the beauty and terror of science|edition= |date= 2008|publisher= Harper Press|location= London|isbn= 978-0-00-714953-7|page= 449}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the word did not enter general use until nearly the end of the same century.

===Modern natural science (1900–present)===
According to a famous 1923 textbook ''Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances'' by the American chemist [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] and the American physical chemist [[Merle Randall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Thermodynamics and the Free Energy of Chemical Substances |first1=Gilbert N. |last1=Lewis |first2=Merle |last2=Randall |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |edition=First |others=later Printing edition |date=1923 |asin= B000GSLHZS}}&lt;/ref&gt; the natural sciences contain three great branches:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Aside from the logical and mathematical sciences, there are three great branches of ''natural science'' which stand apart by reason of the variety of far reaching deductions drawn from a small number of primary postulates — they are [[mechanics]], [[electrodynamics]], and [[thermodynamics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huggins|first=Robert A.|title=Energy storage|date=2010|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-1-4419-1023-3|edition=Online-Ausg. |page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Today, natural sciences are more commonly divided into life sciences, such as botany and zoology; and physical sciences, which include physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy and materials science.

[[File:Oimb campus.jpg|thumbnail|OIMB Campus]]
The '''Oregon Institute of Marine Biology''' (or '''OIMB''') is the marine station of the [[University of Oregon]]. This {{convert|100|acre|km2|sing=on}} marine station is located in [[Charleston, Oregon]] at the mouth of [[Coos Bay]]. Currently, OIMB is home to several permanent faculty members and a number of graduate students. OIMB is a member of the [http://www.naml.org/ National Association of Marine Laboratories] (NAML). In addition to graduate research, undergraduate classes are offered year round, including marine [[birds]] and [[mammal]]s, [[estuarine biology]], [[marine ecology]], [[invertebrate zoology]], [[molecular biology]], [[biology of fishes]], [[biological oceanography]], and [[embryology]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal

The '''Loyd and Dorothy Rippey Library''', one of eight branches of the [http://library.uoregon.edu/ UO Libraries], was added to the campus in 1999. The Rippey Library is open to the public by appointment, and the Oregon Card Program allows Oregon residents 16 years old and over to borrow from the collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Borrow, Request {{!}} UO Libraries|url = http://library.uoregon.edu/borrowing|website = library.uoregon.edu|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Charleston Marine Life Center''' (or '''CMLC'''), currently under construction, will be a public museum and aquarium on the edge of the harbor in [[Charleston, Oregon|Charleston, OR]], across the street from the OIMB campus. Displays aimed at visitors of all ages will emphasize the diversity of animal and plant life in local marine ecosystems. Visitors will learn where to interact with marine organisms in their natural environments and how local scientists study the life histories, evolution and ecology of underwater plants and animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OIMB - The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology|url = http://oimb.uoregon.edu/cmlc/|website = oimb.uoregon.edu|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The University of Oregon first established OIMB as a summer research and education program in 1924, operating out of tents along the beach of Sunset Bay.  OIMB settled into its current location in 1931, when 100 acres of the Coos Head Military Reserve, including several buildings from the Army Corps of Engineers, was deeded to the University of Oregon.  In 1937, OIMB was transferred to Oregon State College (now Oregon State University), and remained theirs until the federal government required the property during World War II.  Following the war, OIMB was initially returned to Oregon State University, but the University of Oregon reclaimed it in 1955 as a summer research facility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Since 1966, OIMB has been expanding its educational programs and its campus, constructing more teaching and research facilities and developing year-round educational programs.  Notably, the '''Loyd and Dorothy Rippey Library''' was built in 1999, and construction of the '''Charleston Marine Life Center''' began in 2012.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://oimb.uoregon.edu/cmlc/|title = OIMB-The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The CMLC will be entirely powered by a wind turbine erected in 2014.  OIMB has functioned as a year-round research facility since 1966, and courses were developed for fall, spring, and summer soon after.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Winter classes will be available beginning in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OIMB - The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology|url = http://oimb.uoregon.edu/academics/winter-term/|website = oimb.uoregon.edu|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research Vessels ==
[[File:PluteusVessel.jpg|thumbnail|R/V Pluteus]]
OIMB operates the R/V ''Pluteus,'' a 42-foot aluminum-hull trawler, the R/V ''Pugettia'', a 20-foot aluminum (Woolridge) boat, and several small vessels, including flat-bottom aluminum boats, an inflatable zodiac, and a large kayak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OIMB - The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology|url = http://oimb.uoregon.edu/traveling-to-oimb/boats/|website = oimb.uoregon.edu|access-date = 2016-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OIMB also has its own 600 m Phantom [[Remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] (Remotely Operated Vehicle).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = OIMB - The Oregon Institute of Marine Biology|url = http://oimb.uoregon.edu/traveling-to-oimb/research-equipment/|access-date = 2016-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6891">'''Education in the performing arts''' is a key part of many [[primary education|primary]] and [[secondary education]] [[curriculum|curricula]] and is also available as a specialisation at the [[tertiary education|tertiary]] level.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The [[performing arts]], which include, but are not limited to [[dance]], [[music]] and [[theatre]], are key elements of [[culture]] and engage participants at a number of levels.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The end point for performing arts education varies: some educators integrate arts into school classrooms to support other curricula while simultaneously building students' art skills, and some focus on performing arts as an academic discipline in itself.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Performing arts integration==
'''Performing arts integration in schools'''

Integrating performing arts into educational experiences can help students learn other subjects, such as science, as well as help them develop various non-arts-based skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Integration-Teaching-Multicultural-Settings/dp/0132565560|title=Arts Integration: Teaching Subject Matter through the Arts in Multicultural Settings|last=Goldberg|first=Merryl|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Pearson|isbn=9780132565561|edition=4|location=Boston|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; As children grow, engaging them in performance arts can help them meet developmental milestones, including those for [[motor skill]]s and [[Psychosocial|psychosocial skills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yumpu.com/en/document/view/18985575/childrens-developmental-benchmarks-and-stages|title=Children's Developmental Benchmarks and Stages|last=Yumpu.com|newspaper=yumpu.com|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, teachers can integrate performing arts and the discussion thereof into their classrooms to honor student [[Self-expression values|self-expression]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/vp/cf/|title=Curriculum Frameworks - Visual &amp; Performing Arts (CA Dept of Education)|website=www.cde.ca.gov|access-date=2016-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bilingual youth can benefit from this type of [[arts integration]] because it offers them modes of communication that can respond more easily to their culture and language than text-based or test-based learning.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Arts-Emergent-Bilingual-Youth-Culturally/dp/0415509742|title=The Arts and Emergent Bilingual Youth: Building Culturally Responsive, Critical and Creative Education in School and Community Contexts|last=Chappell|first=Sharon Verner|last2=Faltis|first2=Christian J.|date=2013-04-10|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415509749|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the language used, teachers have found that using performing arts in the classroom, such as improvisational drama, can help students process and prepare for non-arts-based life situations, including [[bullying]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Artful-Teaching-Integrating-Understanding-Curriculum/dp/0807750808|title=Artful Teaching: Integrating the Arts for Understanding Across the Curriculum, K-8|last=Donahue|first=David M.|date=2010-06-02|publisher=Teachers College Press|isbn=9780807750803|editor-last=Stuart|editor-first=Jennifer|location=New York; Reston, VA|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Performing arts integration out of schools'''

Performing arts integration that empowers students in these ways doesn't only happen in schools; community organizations, such as the Beat Nation Collective in Canada, use hip hop performance to help students deepen their understanding of and broaden their experience with indigenous identity and language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gorliewski|first=Julie|last2=Porfilio|first2=Brad|year=2012|title=Revolutionizing Environmental Education through Indigenous Hip Hop Culture|journal=Canadian Journal of Environmental Education|volume=17|pages=46–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issues of access and equity'''

Despite the benefits of engaging students in performing arts, many students, particularly minority students such as African American and Latino students, do not have equitable access to performing arts in their school classrooms.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

==Discipline-based performing arts==

The performing arts differ from the [[plastic arts]] insofar as the former uses the artist's own body, face and/or presence as a medium Performers often adapt their [[physical appearance|appearance]] by special [[clothing]], [[cosmetics|stage makeup]], etc.

For students pursuing elite [[profession]]al [[career]]s in performing arts like [[classical ballet]] and [[circus]] arts, the physical demands are such that early entry into training can be essential.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The breadth of areas covered by the performing arts is wide, including:
*[[Acting]]
**[[Comedy]]
**[[Drama]]
**[[Magic (illusion)|Magic]]
**[[Film]]
**[[Opera]]
**[[Theatre]]
*[[Music]]
**[[Busking]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2075">The '''physiome''' of an individual's or [[species]]' [[physiology|physiological]] state is the description of its functional behavior. The physiome describes the physiological dynamics of the normal intact [[organism]] and is built upon information and
structure ([[genome]], [[proteome]], and [[morphome]]). The term comes from "physio-" (nature) and "-ome" (as a whole).

The concept of a physiome project was presented to the [[International Union of Physiological Sciences]] (IUPS) by its Commission on Bioengineering in Physiology in 1993. A workshop on designing the Physiome Project was held in 1997. At its world congress in 2001, the IUPS designated the project as a major focus for the next decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hunter |first=Peter J. |authorlink= |author2=Thomas K.

It is based on the assumptions that surplus water in some rivers can be diverted to deficit rivers by creating a network of canals to interconnect the rivers.&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:RiverLinkingMainMap.jpg|River linking map of India]] --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwda.gov.in/index2.asp?slid=3&amp;sublinkid=3&amp;langid=1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons and motivations==
For an instance, in India the rainfall over the country is primarily orographic, associated with tropical depressions originating in the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal. The summer monsoon accounts for more than 85 per cent of the precipitation. The uncertainty of occurrence of rainfall marked by prolonged dry spells and fluctuations in seasonal and annual rainfall is a serious problem for the country. Large parts of Haryana, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu are not only in deficit in rainfall but also subject to large variations, resulting in frequent droughts and causing immense hardship to the population and enormous loss to the nation. The water availability even for drinking purposes becomes critical, particularly in the summer months as the rivers dry up and the ground water recedes. Regional variations in the rainfall lead to situations when some parts of the country do not have enough water even for raising a single crop. On the other hand, excess rainfall occurring in some parts of the country creates havoc due to floods.
 
Irrigation using river water and ground water has been the prime factor for raising the food grain production in India from a mere 50 million tonnes in the 1950s to more than 200 million tonnes at present, leading India to attain self-sufficiency in food. Irrigated area has increased from 22 million hectares to 95 million hectares during this period. The population of India, which is around 1000 million at present, is expected to increase to 1500 to 1800 million in the year 2050 and that would require about 450 million tonnes of food grains. For meeting this requirement, it would be necessary to increase irrigation potential to 160 million hectares for all crops by 2050. India's maximum irrigation potential that could be created through conventional sources has been assessed to be about 140 million hectares. For attaining a potential of 160 million hectares, other strategies shall have to be evolved.
 
Floods are a recurring feature, particularly by the Brahmaputra and Ganga rivers, in which almost 60 per cent of the river flows of India country occur. Flood damages, which were Rs. 52 crores in 1953, have gone up to Rs. 5,846 crores in 1998 with annual average being Rs. 1,343 crores affecting the States of Assam, Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh along with untold human sufferings. On the other hand, large areas in the States of Rajasthan, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu face recurring droughts. As much as 85 percentage of drought prone area falls in these States. One of the most effective ways to increase the irrigation potential for increasing the food grain production, mitigating floods and droughts and reducing regional imbalance in the availability of water is the Inter Basin Water Transfer (IBWT) from the surplus rivers to deficit areas. Brahmaputra and Ganga particularly their northern tributaries, Mahanadi, Godavari and West Flowing Rivers originating from the Western Ghats are found to be surplus in water resources. If we can build storage reservoirs on these rivers and connect them to other parts of the country, regional imbalances could be reduced significantly and lot of benefits could be gained by way of additional irrigation, domestic and industrial water supply, hydropower generation, navigational facilities etc.

== Benefits ==

===Irrigation===
By linking the rivers, vast amount of land areas which will not otherwise be [[Irrigation|irrigated]] and are unusable for [[agriculture]] become fertile.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;[http://www.the-south-asian.com/Aug2004/River-linking.htm Article at the-south-asian], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flood prevention===
During heavy [[rainy season]]s some areas can experience heavy [[flood]]s while other areas might be experiencing [[drought]] like situations. With network of rivers this problem can be greatly avoided by channeling excess water to areas that are not experiencing a flood or are dry.

===Generation of electricity===
With new canals built, feasibility of new [[Damages|dams]] to generate [[hydroelectric power]] becomes a possibility.

===Navigation===
Newly created network of canals opens up new routes and ways and routes of water navigation, which is generally more efficient and cheaper compared to [[road transport]].

==National River Linking Project in India==
{{main|Indian Rivers Inter-link}}
The National River Linking Project (NRLP) is designed to ease [[water shortage]]s in western and southern [[India]] while mitigating the impacts of recurrent floods in the eastern parts of the [[Ganga basin]]. The NRLP, if and when implemented, will be one of the biggest interbasin water transfer projects in the world.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

==Issues and Concerns==

=== Ecological issues ===

One of the major concerns is that rivers change their course in 70–100 years and thus once they are linked, future change of course could create huge practical problems for the project.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Aqua life===
A number of leading [[environmentalist]]s are of the opinion that the project could be an [[ecological disaster]]. There would be a decrease in downstream flows resulting in reduction of [[fresh water]] inflows into the seas seriously jeopardizing [[aquatic life]].&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

=== Deforestation ===
Creation of canals would need large areas of land resulting large scale [[deforestation]] in certain areas.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Areas getting submerged===
Possibility of new dams comes with the threat of large otherwise habitable or reserved land getting submerged under water or surface water.&lt;ref name="ref1" /&gt;

===Displacement of people===
As large strips of land might have to be converted to canals, a considerable population living in this areas must need to be rehabilitated to new areas.

[[File:Saw dust (Zaagsel).jpg|thumb|Sawdust made with [[hand saw]]]]
[[File:Ogatan(JapaneseBriquetteCharcoal).jpg|thumb|''[[:ja:オガ炭|Ogatan]]'', Japanese charcoal briquettes made from sawdust]]

'''Sawdust''' or '''wood dust''' is a by-product or waste product of woodworking operations such as sawing, milling, planing, routing, drilling and sanding. It is composed of fine particles of wood. These operations can be performed by woodworking machinery, portable power tools or by use of hand tools.  Wood dust is also the byproduct of certain animals, birds and insects which live in wood, such as the [[woodpecker]] and [[carpenter ant]]. In some manufacturing industries it can be a significant fire hazard and source of occupational dust exposure. 

Sawdust is the main component of [[particleboard]]. Wood dust is a form of particulate matter, or [[particulates]]. Research on wood dust health hazards comes within the field of occupational health science, and study of wood dust control comes within the field of indoor air quality engineering.

==Formation==
Two waste products, dust and chips, form at the working surface during woodworking operations such as sawing, milling and sanding.  These operations both shatter lignified wood cells and break out whole cells and groups of cells. Shattering of wood cells creates dust, while breaking out of whole groups of wood cells creates chips. The more cell-shattering that occurs, the finer the dust particles that are produced. For example, sawing and milling are mixed cell shattering and chip forming processes, whereas sanding is almost exclusively cell shattering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol62/mono62-6.pdf IARC 1995. ''Wood Dust''. In ''IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans''. Volume 62: Wood Dust and Formaldehyde. Lyon, France: World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, p.70.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
A major use of sawdust is for particleboard; coarse sawdust may be used for [[Pulp (paper)|wood pulp]]. Sawdust has a variety of other practical uses, including serving as a [[mulch]], as an alternative to clay [[litter box|cat litter]], or as a [[fuel]]. Until the advent of refrigeration, it was often used in [[Icehouse (building)|icehouses]] to keep ice frozen during the summer. It has been used in [[art|artistic displays]], and as [[scatter (modeling)|scatter]] in [[model railroading|miniature railroad]] and other models. It is also sometimes used to soak up liquid spills, allowing the spill to be easily collected or swept aside.  As such, it was formerly common on barroom floors.&lt;ref&gt;Felman, David (2005) "Why Did Bars Used to Put Sawdust on the Floor? Why Don't They Anymore?" ''Why Do Elephant's Jump?'' HarperCollins, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3akztvHXlf0C&amp;pg=PA118 page 118], {{ISBN|978-0-06-053914-6}}, quoting Christopher Halleron, bartender and beer columnist.&lt;/ref&gt; It is used to make [[Cutler's resin]]. Mixed with water and frozen, it forms [[pykrete]], a slow-melting, much stronger form of [[ice]].

Sawdust is used in the manufacture of [[Briquette|charcoal briquettes]]. The claim for invention of the first commercial charcoal briquettes goes to [[Henry Ford]] who created them from the wood scraps and sawdust produced by his automobile factory.&lt;ref&gt;Green, Harvey (2006) ''Wood: Craft, Culture, History'' Penguin Books, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=bQzZri48QvcC&amp;pg=PT403 page 403], {{ISBN|978-1-1012-0185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in food===
Cellulose, fibre starch that is indigestible to humans, and a filler in some low calorie foods, can be and is made from sawdust, as well as from other plant sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nassauer, Sarah|title=Why Wood Pulp Makes Ice Cream Creamier |date=4 May 2011|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703834804576300991196803916|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is no documentation&lt;ref&gt;Packing houses formerly purchased large quantities of sawdust for the cutting room floors, and still purchase sawdust for use as a fuel and flavoring in the smoking process.&lt;/ref&gt; for the persistent rumor, based upon [[Upton Sinclair]]'s novel ''[[The Jungle]]'', that sawdust was used as a filler in sausage, cellulose derived from sawdust was and is used for sausage casings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/x6556e/X6556E03.htm|author=Savic, I. V.|title=Small-scale sausage production: Sausage Casings|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) | location    = Rome|date=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sawdust-derived cellulose has also been used as a filler in bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Bread Labels on Wood Fiber Draw Attack|date=9 October 1985|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-09/news/mn-16819_1_high-fiber-bread|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100916223613/http://articles.latimes.com/1985-10-09/news/mn-16819_1_high-fiber-bread|archivedate=16 September 2010|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When cereals were scarce, sawdust was sometimes an ingredient in Kommissbrot. [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] survivor, Dr. [[Miklós Nyiszli]], reports in ''Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account'' that the subaltern medical staff, who served [[Josef Mengele|Dr. Josef Mengele]], subsisted on "bread made from wild [[Chestnut#Nutrition|chestnuts]] sprinkled with sawdust."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nyiszli, Miklos|title=Auschwitz: A Doctor's Eyewitness Account|chapter=3|date=2011|publisher=New York: Arcade Publishing|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Health hazards ==
Airborne sawdust and sawdust accumulations present a number of health and safety hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.statefundca.com/safety/safetymeeting/SafetyMeetingArticle.aspx?ArticleID=125
 | title=Wood Dust Exposure
 | publisher=State Compensation Insurance Fund | accessdate=April 30, 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504235537/http://www.statefundca.com/safety/safetymeeting/SafetyMeetingArticle.aspx?ArticleID=125 | archivedate=May 4, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood dust becomes a potential health problem when, for example, the wood particles, from processes such as sanding, become airborne and are inhaled. Wood dust is a known human [[carcinogen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/wooddust.pdf | title=Report on Carcinogens, Twelfth Edition, Wood Dust | accessdate=July 12, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130217080608/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/roc/twelfth/profiles/WoodDust.pdf | archivedate=February 17, 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/wd_no_appendices_508.pdf | title=FINAL Report on Carcinogens Background Document for Wood Dust | accessdate=July 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain woods and their dust contain toxins that can produce severe allergic reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Meier, Eric|title=Wood Allergies and Toxicity|publisher=The Wood Database| url=http://www.wood-database.com/wood-articles/wood-allergies-and-toxicity/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breathing airborne wood dust may cause allergic respiratory symptoms, mucosal and non-allergic respiratory symptoms, and cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/wooddust/index.html United Startes Department of Labor: Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Wood Dust.]&lt;/ref&gt; In the USA, lists of carcinogenic factors are published by the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). All these organisations recognize wood dust as carcinogenic in relation to the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

People can be exposed to wood dust in the workplace by breathing it in, skin contact, or eye contact. The [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) has set the legal limit ([[permissible exposure limit]]) for wood dust exposure in the workplace as 15&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; total exposure and 5&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; respiratory exposure over an 8-hour workday. The [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) has set a [[recommended exposure limit]] (REL) of 1&amp;nbsp;mg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; over an 8-hour workday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CDC - NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards - Wood dust|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/npg/npgd0667.html|website = www.cdc.gov|accessdate = 2015-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Respirable particulates ===
As with all airborne [[particulates]], wood dust particle sizes are classified with regard to effect on the human respiratory system.  For this classification, the unit for measurement of particle sizes is the micrometre or micron (μm), where 1 micrometre = 1 micron. Particles below 50 μm are not normally visible to the naked human eye.&lt;ref&gt;Yuanhui Zhang, 2004. ''Indoor Air Quality Engineering''. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, p.14&lt;/ref&gt; Particles of concern for human respiratory health are those &lt;100 μm (where the symbol &lt; means ‘less than’).

Zhang (2004)&lt;ref&gt;Yuanhui Zhang, 2004. ''Indoor Air Quality Engineering''. Boca Raton, Florida: CRC Press, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; has defined the size of indoor particulates according to respiratory fraction:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Respiratory fraction !! Size range
|-
| Inhalable || ≤ 100 μm
|-
| Thoracic || ≤10 μm
|-
| Respirable || ≤4 μm
|-
| Diminutive || ≤0.5 μm
|}

Particles which precipitate in the vicinity of the mouth and eyes, and get into the organism, are defined as the inhalable fraction, that is total dust. Smaller fractions, penetrating into the non-cartilage respiratory tract, are defined as respirable dust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dust emitted in the wood industry is characterized by the dimensional disintegration of particles up to 5&amp;nbsp;μm, and that
is why they precipitate mostly in the nasal cavity, increasing the risk of cancer of the upper respiratory tract.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpp.krakow.pl/journal/archive/11_07_s5/pdf/43_11_07_s5_article.pdf Baran, S., &amp; Teul, I. 2007. Wood Dust: An Occupational Hazard Which Increases the Risk of Respiratory Disease. Journal of Physiology and Pharmacology 58, Suppl. 5, pp.43-50.]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exposure ===
The parameter most commonly used to characterize exposures to wood dust in air is total wood dust concentration, in mass per unit volume. In countries that use the metric system, this is usually measured in mg/m³ (milligram per cubic metre)&lt;ref&gt;[http://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol62/mono62-6.pdf IARC 1995. IARC Monographs on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans. Volume 62: Wood Dust and Formaldehyde. Lyon, France: World Health Organization International Agency for Research on Cancer, p.66.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study to estimate occupational exposure to inhalable wood dust by country, industry, the level of exposure and type of wood dust in 25 member states of the European Union (EU-25) found that in 2000–2003, about 3.6 million workers (2.0% of the employed EU-25 population) were occupationally exposed to inhalable wood dust. The highest exposure levels were estimated to occur in the construction sector and furniture industry.&lt;ref&gt;Kaupinnen, T., et.al. 2006 Occupational Exposure to Inhalable Wood Dust in the Member States of the European Union. Ann Occup Hyg (2006) 50 (6): 549-561.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cancer ===
Wood dust is known to be a human carcinogen, based on sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from studies in humans. It has been demonstrated through human epidemiologic studies that exposure to wood dust increases the occurrence of cancer of the nose (nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses). An association of wood dust exposure and cancers of the nose has been observed in numerous case reports, cohort studies, and case control studies specifically addressing nasal cancer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/wd.pdf Final Report on Carcinogens. Background Document for Wood Dust. Meeting of the NTP Board of Scientific Counselors, December 13–14, 2000. Research Triangle Park, NC: U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Public Health Service National Toxicology Program / Durham, NC: Technology Planning and Management Corporation.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417232235/http://ntp.niehs.nih.gov/ntp/newhomeroc/roc10/WD.pdf |date=2012-04-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other safety hazards of wood dust==
Water-borne [[bacteria]] digest organic material in leachate, but use up much of the available oxygen. This high "biological oxygen demand" can suffocate fish and other organisms. There is an equally detrimental effect on beneficial bacteria, so it is not at all advisable to use sawdust within home aquariums, as was once done by hobbyists seeking to save some expense on activated charcoal.

===Explosions and fire===
{{Main|Combustibility#Combustible dust|Dust explosion}}
Sawdust is flammable and accumulations provide a ready source of fuel.  Airborne sawdust can be ignited by sparks or even heat accumulation and result in explosions.

===Environmental effects===
At [[sawmill]]s, unless reprocessed into particleboard, burned in a sawdust burner or used to make heat for other milling operations, sawdust may collect in piles and add harmful [[leachate]]s into local water systems, creating an [[environmental hazard]]. This has placed small sawyers and environmental agencies in a deadlock.

Questions about the science behind the determination of sawdust being an environmental hazard remain for sawmill operators (though this is mainly with finer particles), who compare wood residuals to dead trees in a forest. Technical advisors have reviewed some of the environmental studies, but say most lack standardized methodology or evidence of a direct impact on [[wildlife]]. They don’t take into account large [[drainage area]]s, so the amount of material that is getting into the water from the site in relation to the total drainage area is minuscule.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

Other scientists have a different view, saying the "dilution is the solution to pollution" argument is no longer accepted in environmental science. The decomposition of a tree in a forest is similar to the impact of sawdust, but the difference is of scale. Sawmills may be storing thousands of cubic metres of [[wood residues]] in one place, so the issue becomes one of concentration.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

But of larger concern are substances such as [[lignin]]s and [[fatty acid]]s that protect trees from predators while they are alive, but can leach into water and poison wildlife. Those types of things remain in the tree and, as the tree decays, they slowly are broken down. But when sawyers are processing a large volume of wood and large concentrations of these materials permeate into the runoff, the [[toxicity]] they cause is harmful  to a broad range of organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/environment.asp Canadian Geographic Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428075135/http://www.canadiangeographic.ca/magazine/SO05/indepth/environment.asp |date=2006-04-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wood dust control==
To lower the concentration of airborne dust concentrations during woodworking, dust extraction systems are used. These can be divided into two types. The first are local exhaust ventilation systems, the second are room ventilation systems. Use of personal [[respirator]]s, a form of [[personal protective equipment]], can also isolate workers from dust.

===Local exhaust ventilation (LEV) systems===
These rely on air pulled with a suction force through piping systems from the point of dust formation to a waste disposal unit. LEV systems consist of four elements: dust hoods at the point of dust formation, ventilation ducts, an air cleaning device (waste separator or dust collector) and an air moving device (a fan, otherwise known as an impeller).&lt;ref&gt;Mutchler, J.E., 1973. ''Chapter 41: Local Exhaust Systems''. In: ''The Industrial Environment: its Evaluation and Control''. Washington: US Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NOISH). www.cdc.gov/niosh/pdfs/74-177-w.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The air, containing dust and chips from the woodworking operation, is sucked by an impeller. The impeller is usually built into, or placed close to, the waste disposal unit, or dust collector.

Guidelines of performance for woodworking LEV systems exist, and these tie into occupational air quality regulations that exist in many countries. The LEV guidelines often referred to are those set by the ACIAH.

====Low Volume/High Velocity (LVHV) systems====
Low-volume/high-velocity capture systems are a specialised type of LEV that use an extractor hood designed as an integral part of the tool or positioned very close to the operating point of the cutting tool. The hood is designed to provide high capture velocities, often greater than 50&amp;nbsp;m/s (10,000 fpm) at the contaminant release point. This high velocity is accompanied by airflows often less than 0.02m3/s (50 cfm) resulting from the small face area of the hood that is used.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess, W.A., et. al., 2004. ''Ventilation for Control of the Work Environment'', 2nd ed. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, p.192&lt;/ref&gt; These systems have come into favour for portable power tools, although adoption of the technology is not widespread. Festool is one manufacturer of portable power tools using LVHV ventilation integrated into the tool design.

===Room ventilation systems===
If suitably designed, general ventilation can also be used as a control of airborne dust. General ventilation can often help reduce skin and clothing contamination, and dust deposition on surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/occupational_health/publications/en/oehairbornedust.pdf WHO, 1999. Hazard Prevention and Control in the Work Environment: Airborne Dust. WHO/SDE/OEH/99.14. Geneva: World Health Organization, Department of Protection of the Human Environment, Occupational and Environmental Health. p.98.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air quality standards for respirable wood dust==
Within industry, many countries have air quality regulations. This is to help ensure that wood dust is extracted to a level that ensures specified maximum allowable residual airborne dust concentrations and worker exposure levels.

Bullying, for instance, occurs when there is an imbalance of power between the “bully” and the “bullied” and can happen through physical contact, verbal attacks, social exclusion, and psychological manipulation. Students are bullied when they are repeatedly and intentionally exposed to harmful and/or aggressive behaviour that results in injury or discomfort.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002469/246928e.pdf|title=Reaching Out: Preventing and Addressing SOGIE-related School Violence in Viet Nam, volume 2|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=15, 21, 27-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Global, regional and local research demonstrates that schools and other educational institutions in Viet Nam are not always safe and inclusive spaces for children and young people. Many schools are sites of physical, verbal, psychosocial and sexual violence.&lt;ref&gt;Pinheiro P. (2006). World Report on Violence against Children.

== Studies ==
In 2013 the Global School-based Health Survey (GSHS) showed that approximately one in six students, aged 13-17 years, reported being in a physical fight one or more times during the last 12 months, with this behaviour being more common for boys (26%) than girls (10%).&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organisation &amp; Hanoi Medical University. (2013). Global School-based Student Health Survey: Vietnam 2013 Fact Sheet. Hanoi: WHO. &lt;/ref&gt; Reported experiences of bullying, one or more days within the last 30 days, were however similar for boys and girls (23% and 24% respectively).&lt;ref&gt;Quang Dao, V.

Viet Nam has also had some research studies about violence against LGBT students, including a field survey carried out by CCIHP with 520 LGBT people with the average age of 21.&lt;ref&gt;Hershberger, S. L., &amp; D’Augelli, A. R. (1995). The impact of victimization on the mental health and suicidality of lesbian, gay, and bisexual youths. Developmental Psychology, 31, 65–74. &lt;/ref&gt; This study revealed that 41% of LGBT participants suffered from discrimination and violence in either schools or universities. [[Save the Children]] Vietnam and the Institute of Social and Medical Studies completed a separate study on 170 LGBT young adults which found that discrimination against these children (at home and school) contributed to their increased risk of homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;Save the Children. (2015). Child Rights Situation Analysis. Ha Noi: Viet Nam Country Office. &lt;/ref&gt; They were at high risk of violence at home, school and on the streets. Only 15.9% of the LGBT youth participants had a post-secondary school education, 47.8% had only a lower secondary education, 27.6% had only a primary school education, and 8.7% had no schooling at all.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One study conducted by the Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment (iSEE) involving 2,363 respondents from 63 provinces in Viet Nam found that one in three respondents felt that they had been subject to discrimination because of their sexual orientation and gender identity within 12 months preceding the survey, with a high degree of frequency.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Luong,T.H.,&amp;Pham,Q,P.(2015).Is it because I am LGBT?: Discriminations on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity in Vietnam. Ha Noi: The Institute for Studies of Society, Economy and Environment. &lt;/ref&gt; The study also reported that transgender people experience the highest degree of discrimination. This study focused its analysis on the discrimination experienced by LGBT people in families, schools, workplaces, healthcare settings and housing, among other aspects. Looking specifically at the school setting, the study found that nearly a quarter of students had been harassed, bullied by teachers and/or school officials because they were considered to be LGBT. Gender indicative uniforms proved to be a significant obstacle for transgender people, affecting their quality of learning and their mental health. In light of the findings, some recommendations specific to the education sector included: 1) School psychological counseling models need to pre-empt the psychological and physical development of students to provide well-timed educational support; 2) Create extracurricular programs that respond to the needs of students; 3) Respect students’ choice of uniform to fit with their desired gender and; 4) Educate faculties about the LGBT community.

[[Plan (aid organisation)|Plan International]] Viet Nam, in cooperation with the Ha Noi Department of Education and Training (DOET), [[Center for Research and Applied Sciences in Gender, Family, Women and Adolescents]] [[(CSAGA)]], and the [[International Center for Research on Women|International Centre for Research on Women]] (ICRW), has implemented a “Gender Responsive School Pilot Model project” meant to prevent and respond to SRGBV. The 3-year project (2014-2016), funded by UNTF and Plan International involves 20 secondary/high schools in Ha Noi. The intervention provides teacher training on gender equality, SRGBV, and reproductive health to encourage lessons on related topics to be integrated into the curriculum. The intervention also encourages the formation of youth leadership organizations and awareness-raising activities with parents. A key component of the project is the establishment of a psychological counselling room at the participating schools. To date, nearly 2,300 students have received individualized counselling and over 4,100 students have received group counselling. The project has found that while only 6% of students in Viet Nam know about a public hotline for counselling, 21% of the total students in the 20 schools of the project have sought counselling services.&lt;ref&gt;Plan International Viet Nam.

== Prevention ==
The National Policy Framework for Gender Equality was approved for the period 2011-2020 with the goal of highlighting the importance of gender equality for the socio-economic development of the country, including in education efforts towards this end. Furthermore, unlike many of its neighbours, Viet Nam now no longer has a ban on same-sex marriage, and has indeed never had punitive laws around either male or female same-sex relations.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, R.

Retrieved from &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.metroweekly.com/2015/01/&lt;/nowiki&gt; vietnam-removes-same-sex-marriage- &lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Viet Nam passed a landmark law by a vote of 282-84 in 2015 enshrining transgender people’s right to legal recognition of a gender identity other than that indicated by their sex rights for transgender people and paving the way to allow those who have undergone gender reassignment to register their legal identity under their new sex.&lt;ref&gt;Wee, D.

'''Sex manuals''' are [[book]]s which explain how to perform [[Human sexual activity|sexual practices]]; they also commonly feature advice on [[birth control]], and sometimes on [[safe sex]] and [[sexual relationship]]s.

== Early sex manuals ==
[[File:Kamasutra5.jpg|thumb|Artistic depiction of a [[sex position]]]]

In the Graeco-Roman era, a sex manual was written by
[[Philaenis|Philaenis of Samos]], possibly a [[hetaira]] ([[courtesan]]) of the [[Hellenistic period]] (3rd–1st century BC).&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Erôs in Ancient Greece|last1=Sanders |first1=E.|last2=Thumiger |first2=C.|last3=Carey |first3=C. |last4=Lowe |first4=N.|date=2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199605507|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qt7JkvxScSkC|page=287|accessdate=2014-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preserved by a series of fragmentary  [[papyrus]]es which attest its popularity, it served as a source of inspiration for  [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'', written around 3&amp;nbsp;BC, which is partially a sex manual, and partially a burlesque on the art of love.

The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'' of [[Vatsyayana]], believed to have been written in the 1st to 6th centuries, has a notorious reputation as a sex manual, although only a small part of its text is devoted to sex. It was compiled by the Indian sage Vatsyayana sometime between the second and fourth centuries CE. His work was based on earlier [[Kamashastra]]s or ''Rules of Love'' going back to at least the seventh century BCE, and is a compendium of the social norms and love-customs of patriarchal Northern India around the time he lived. Vatsyayana's ''Kama Sutra'' is valuable today for his psychological insights into the interactions and scenarios of love, and for his structured approach to the many diverse situations he describes. He defines different types of men and women, matching what he terms "equal" unions, and gives detailed descriptions of many love-postures.

The ''Kama Sutra'' was written for the wealthy male city-dweller. It is not, and was never intended to be, a lover's guide for the masses, nor is it a "Tantric love-manual". About three hundred years after the ''Kama Sutra'' became popular, some of the love-making positions described in it were reinterpreted in a Tantric way. Since Tantra is an all-encompassing sensual science, love-making positions are relevant to spiritual practice.

The earliest East Asian sex manual is the ''Su Nü Jing''. Probably written during the Chinese [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC-220 AD), the work was long lost in China itself, but preserved in Japan as part of the medical anthology ''[[Ishinpō]]'' (984). It is a Daoist text purporting to describe how one might achieve long life and immortality by manipulating the [[yin and yang]] forces of the body through sexual techniques, which are described in some detail.&lt;ref&gt;https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E7%B4%A0%E5%A5%B3%E7%BB%8F&lt;/ref&gt;

Medieval sex manuals include the lost works of [[Elephantis]], by [[Constantine the African]]; ''[[Ananga Ranga]]'', a 12th-century collection of [[Hindu]] erotic works; and ''[[The Perfumed Garden|The Perfumed Garden for the Soul's Recreation]]'', a 16th-century [[Arabic language|Arabic]] work by [[Sheikh Nefzaoui]]. The fifteenth-century ''[[Speculum al foderi]]'' (The Mirror of Coitus) is the first medieval European work to discuss sexual positions. Constantine the African also penned a medical treatise on sexuality, known as ''Liber de coitu''. The medieval Jewish physician and writer [[Maimonides]] is author of a ''Treatise on Cohabitation.''

== Modern sex manuals ==
Despite the existence of ancient sex manuals in other cultures, sex manuals were banned in Western culture for many years. What sexual information was available was generally only available in the form of illicit [[pornography]] or medical books, which generally discussed either sexual physiology or sexual disorders. The authors of medical works went so far as to write the most sexually explicit parts of their texts in [[Latin]], so as to make them inaccessible to the general public (see [[Krafft-Ebing]]'s ''[[Psychopathia Sexualis]]'' as an example).

A few translations of the ancient works were circulated privately, such as ''The Perfumed Garden''….

In the late 19th Century, [[Ida Craddock]] wrote many serious instructional tracts on human sexuality and appropriate, respectful sexual relations between married couples. Among her works were ''The Wedding Night'' and ''Right Marital Living''. In 1918 [[Marie Stopes]] published ''[[Married Love]]'', considered groundbreaking despite its limitations in details used to discuss sex acts.

[[Theodoor Hendrik van de Velde]]'s book ''Het volkomen huwelijk'' ''(The Perfect Marriage)'', published in 1926, was well known in [[Netherlands]], [[Germany]], [[Sweden]] and [[Estonia]]. In Germany, ''Die vollkommene Ehe'' reached its 42nd printing in 1932 despite its being placed on the list of forbidden books, the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]], by the Roman Catholic Church. In Sweden, ''Det fulländade äktenskapet'' was widely known although regarded as pornographic and unsuitable for young readers long into the 1960s. In English, [[Ideal Marriage: Its Physiology and Technique]] has 42 printings in its original 1930 edition, and was republished in new editions in 1965 and 2000.

David Reuben, M. D.'s book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask) (book)|Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex* (*But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'', published in 1969, was one of the first sex manuals that entered mainstream culture in the 1960s. Although it did not feature explicit images of sex acts, its descriptions of sex acts were  detailed, addressing common questions and misunderstandings Reuben had heard from his own patients. Most notably, Reuben dismissed popular medical-psychiatric notions of "vaginal" vs. "clitoral" orgasm, explaining exactly how female physiology works.

''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' by Dr. [[Alex Comfort]] was the first visually explicit sex manual to be published by a mainstream publisher. It was followed by ''[[The Joy of Gay Sex]]'' and ''[[The Joy of Lesbian Sex]]''. Its appearance in public bookstores in the 1970s opened the way to the widespread publication of sex manuals in the West. As a result, hundreds of sex manuals are now available in print.

Sex manuals and works of the sort became so popular during the [[sexual revolution]] of the 1970s that even religious groups developed their own manuals.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=DeRogatis |first=A.  |title=What Would Jesus Do? Sexuality and Salvation in Protestant Evangelical Sex Manuals, 1950s to the Present |journal=Church History |volume=74 |issue=1 |year=2005 |pages=97–137 |doi=10.1017/S0009640700109679 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most notably, the book ''[[The Act of Marriage]]'' by Christian Baptist authors Tim and Beverly LaHaye has sold over 2.5 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=LaHaye |first=T. |last2=LaHaye |first2=B. |title=The Act of Marriage: The Beauty of Sexual Love |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |publisher=Zondervan |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they began with the prerequisite of a heterosexual, complementarian relationship, the behavior they suggested went far beyond standard Christian teaching at that time.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis" /&gt; They suggested role play, experimentation with sex devices, masturbation to ensure climax and many other practices that were considered taboo up until the 1970s in protestant bedrooms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lahaye |first=T. F. |year=1978 |title=Act of Marriage |location= |publisher=Bantam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other manuals such as Marabel Morgan's [[The Total Woman]] emphasized the importance of the female orgasm. While they all required marriage, heterosexuality and complementarianism, they did push the bounds of accepted practice within their respective spheres of influence.&lt;ref name="DeRogatis" /&gt; Today, Christian authors continue to produce similar manuals and guides to their constituents in search of appropriate, fulfilling behavior. Books such as Mark and Grace Driscoll's [[Real Marriage]] encourage Christians to experiment in the bedrooms with their spouses, even encouraging acts that have long been rejected by protestant tradition such as anal sex.

One of the currently most well known in America is ''[[The Guide to Getting it On]]!'' by Paul Joannides. Now in its seventh edition, it has won several prestigious awards and been translated into 12 foreign languages since appearing in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | first = P. | last = Joannides | title = The Guide To Getting It On | edition = fifth | publisher = Goofy Foot Press | place = Oregon, USA | year = 2006 | isbn = 1-885535-69-4 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070816182246/http://www.goofyfootpress.com/index.clickthrough.html | archivedate = 2007-08-16 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''slide chart''' is a hand-held device, usually of paper, cardboard, or plastic, for conducting simple calculations or looking up information.
A circular slide chart is sometimes referred to as a wheel chart or [[volvelle]].

Unlike other hand-held mechanical calculating devices such as [[slide rules]] and [[addiator]]s, which have been replaced by electronic calculators and computer software, wheel charts and slide charts have survived to the present time. There are a number of companies who design and manufacture these devices.

Unlike the general-purpose mechanical calculators, slide charts are usually devoted to carrying out a particular specialized calculation, or displaying information on a single product or a particular process. For example, the "CurveEasy" wheel chart displays information related to spherical geometry calculations and the Prestolog calculator is used for cost/profit calculations.  Another example of a wheel chart is the [[planisphere]], which shows the location of stars in the sky for a given location, date, and time.

Slide charts are often associated with particular sports, political campaigns or commercial companies. For example, a pharmaceutical company may create wheel charts printed with their company name and product information for distribution to medical practitioners.

Slide charts are common collectables.

==History==
It was introduced by the [[First National Bank of Atlanta]] on May 15, 1974. It started out at only eleven locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On May 15, 1974First National Bank of Atlanta (now part of Wells Fargo) introduced eleven new automated teller machines to customers.|url=https://plus.google.com/+wellsfargo/posts/ALbSJDXxEy8|website=Google+|publisher=Wells Fargo|accessdate=20 August 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422235006/https://plus.google.com/+wellsfargo/posts/ALbSJDXxEy8|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were in commerce starting May 20, 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tsdrsec.uspto.gov/ts/cd/casedoc/sn73030081/ORC20051121153756/download.pdf|title=Tillie the Alltime Teller|publisher=United States Patent Office|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting 1977, other banks purchased rights to use Tillie the All-Time Teller as their ATM system. By March 21, 1981, they were available at 70 locations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=3.

==Appearance==
Tillie the All-Time Teller machines were red and gold to make them look more attractive.&lt;ref name=digest /&gt; On the bottom left was the place to enter an "access card," which featured a cartoon character.&lt;ref name=digest /&gt; Above that was a place to enter a "secret code" that the customer chose.&lt;ref name=digest /&gt; On the bottom center was a picture of a cartoon blonde girl with china-blue eyes&lt;ref name=news /&gt; and a red hat. Above that was the place it handed out cash and coins. On the top right was the place to enter a desired amount of money.

==How it worked==
[[File:Tillie the All-Time Teller appearence.jpeg|thumb|A diagram showing the steps to using Tillie the All-Time Teller]]

Customers could use Tillie the All-Time Teller by following these steps:
# Inserting an "Alltime Tellercard"
# Following instructions presented on its TV screen
# Entering a "secret code" and entering a desired amount of money on the "money keyboard" ($200 was the limit)
# The machine would automatically hand out the desired amount of money.
# Entering a transaction envelope into the deposit slot

==Advertising==
There were a variety of advertisements made by the [[First National Bank of Atlanta]] in order to promote Tillie the All-Time Teller. These include:&lt;!--all three cited in the "Bibliography" section.--&gt;
* In one of the advertisements, a blonde woman that wore a red and white polka-dotted dress sang "I'm Tillie the All-Time Teller, I work for First National Bank" while standing beside the machine.
* In another advertisement, a balding, middle-aged man approached the machine singing "If You Knew Tillie" to the tune of "[[If You Knew Susie]]." The song went like this:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Oh, if you knew Tillie like I know Tillie
Oh, oh, oh, what a girl!
She works to please me, to make life easy
Oh, oh, she makes my banking smooth and breezy
Day or nighttime, I don’t care
When I need money, I know my all-time teller’s there!
If you knew Tillie, like I know Tillie
Oh, oh, oh!&lt;/poem&gt;}}
* For Tillie the All-Time Teller's third anniversary, the machine was featured in an advertisement where they sang "She's a Jolly Good Teller." It  originally aired on KSEL-TV and [[KAMC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=Dub_Rogers_-_KLBK_Archival_Footage%2C_no._9_-_American_State_Bank|title=Dub Rogers - KLBK Archival Footage, no. 9 - American State Bank|work=Texas Archive of the Moving Image}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The word "Tillie" has become a slang to describe any ATM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Billips|first1=Mike|title=Since '78, Atlanta lost banks, but not economic power|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/1998/06/15/focus8.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=29 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{about|vascular tissue in plants|transport in animals|Circulatory system}}
'''Vascular tissue''' is a complex conducting [[tissue (biology)|tissue]], formed of more than one cell type, found in [[vascular plant]]s. The primary components of vascular tissue are the [[xylem]] and [[phloem]]. These two tissues transport fluid and nutrients internally. There are also two [[meristem]]s associated with vascular tissue: the [[vascular cambium]] and the [[cork cambium]].  All the vascular tissues within a particular plant together constitute the '''vascular tissue system''' of that plant.

The cells in vascular tissue are typically long and slender. Since the xylem and phloem function in the conduction of water, minerals, and nutrients throughout the plant, it is not surprising that their form should be similar to pipes.  The individual cells of phloem are connected end-to-end, just as the sections of a pipe might be. As the plant grows, new vascular tissue [[cellular differentiation|differentiates]] in the growing tips of the plant. The new tissue is aligned with existing vascular tissue, maintaining its connection throughout the plant.
The vascular tissue in plants is arranged in long, discrete strands called [[vascular bundles]].  These bundles include both xylem and phloem, as well as supporting and protective cells.  In [[plant stem|stems]] and [[root]]s, the xylem typically lies closer to the interior of the stem with phloem towards the exterior of the stem.  In the stems of some Asterales [[dicot]]s, there may be phloem located inwardly from the xylem as well.

Between the xylem and phloem is a [[meristem]] called the vascular cambium.  This tissue divides off [[cell (biology)|cell]]s that will become additional xylem and phloem. This growth increases the girth of the plant, rather than its length.  As long as the vascular cambium continues to produce new cells, the plant will continue to grow more stout.  In [[tree]]s and other plants that develop [[wood]], the vascular cambium allows the expansion of vascular tissue that produces woody growth. Because this growth ruptures the [[epidermis (botany)|epidermis]] of the stem, woody plants also have a [[cork cambium]] that develops among the phloem.  The cork cambium gives rise to thickened [[cork (tissue)|cork]] cells to protect the surface of the plant and reduce water loss.  Both the production of wood and the production of cork are forms of [[secondary growth]].

In [[leaf|leaves]], the vascular bundles are located among the spongy [[Leaf#Mesophyll|mesophyll]]. The xylem is oriented toward the [[adaxial]] surface of the leaf (usually the upper side), and phloem is oriented toward the [[abaxial]] surface of the leaf.  This is why [[aphid]]s are typically found on the undersides of the leaves rather than on the top, since the phloem transports sugars manufactured by the plant and they are closer to the lower surface.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

==Life==
Müller was born in [[Moscow]], his father was a [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German]] from [[Riga]].&lt;ref name="Yermolovich"&gt;{{cite book | author=Д. И. Ермолович| title =Открывая Мюллера| language =Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon graduation from [[Moscow State University]], Müller continued studies in Oxford and London. In 1918, Müller became a Professor and lectured at various institutions.&lt;ref name="Yermolovich"/&gt; He was described as "sincere opponent of German [[militarism]]" by his student and noted scholar [[Igor Diakonov]].&lt;ref name ="Diakonov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srcc.msu.su/uni-persona/site/authors/djakonov/9.htm|script-title=ru:Книга воспоминаний|publisher =Srcc.msu.su|author=И. М. Дьяконов|accessdate=Aug 25, 2011|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1915 Müller married Aleksandra Petrovna Gneusheva. In the 1920s Müller wrote multiple articles on English literature for ''[[Granat Encyclopedic Dictionary]]'', ''[[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]]'' and ''[[Literature Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;ref name="Yermolovich"/&gt; According to Diakonov, Müller saw the cause of transition from [[Old English]] to [[Middle English]] and the loss of external grammatical flexion in the plague epidemic of the 14th century.&lt;ref name ="Diakonov"/&gt; In 1926 Müller moved with his wife to [[Saint Petersburg]]. In the following year he began working on English dictionaries, together with [[Semyon Boyanus]].

The exact date of Müller's death is unknown. It is believed that both Vladimir Müller and his wife died during the [[siege of Leningrad]] in 1941.&lt;ref name="Yermolovich"/&gt; Müller's wife was an art scholar and worked in the [[National Library of Russia]].&lt;ref name ="Muller"/&gt;

The name "'''Whitechapel Boys'''" identifies a loosely-knit group of Anglo-[[Jewish]] writers and artists of the early 20th century.  It is named after [[Whitechapel]], which contained one of London's main Jewish settlements and from which many of its members came.  These members included [[Mark Gertler (artist)|Mark Gertler]], [[Isaac Rosenberg]], [[David Bomberg]], [[Joseph Leftwich]], Jacob Kramer, Morris Goldstein, [[Stephen Winsten]], [[John Rodker]], [[Lazarus Aaronson]] and its only female member, [[Clara Birnberg]].&lt;ref name="Dickson&amp;MacDougall"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickson |first1=Rachel |last2=MacDougall |first2=Sarah |year=2004 |title=The Whitechapel Boys |journal=[[Jewish Quarterly]] |publisher=Routledge |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=29–34 |doi=10.1080/0449010X.2004.10706848}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacDougall |first=Sarah |editor-last1=Walsh |editor-first1=Michael J.

{{selfref|For the categories on Wikipedia that are derived from this scheme, see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Plants/World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions]].}}
The '''World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions''' (WGSRPD) is a [[biogeography|biogeographical]] system developed by the international [[Biodiversity Information Standards|Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)]] organization, formerly the International Working Group on Taxonomic Databases.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=ix}} The WGSRPD standards, like other standards for data fields in [[botany|botanical]] databases, were developed to promote "the wider and more effective dissemination of information about the world's heritage of [[Biota (ecology)|biological organisms]] for the benefit of the world at large". The system provides clear definitions and codes for recording [[plant]] distributions at four scales or levels, from "botanical continents" down to parts of large countries. Current users of the system include the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN), the [[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] (GRIN), and the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] (WCSP).

== Principles of organization ==

The scheme is one of a number developed by Biodiversity Information Standards  particularly aimed at [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] [[database]]s.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=iii}} The starting point was the "need for an agreed system of geographical units at approximately 'country' level and upwards for use in recording plant distributions".{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=ix}} The scheme represents a compromise between political and botanical divisions.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=xi}} All boundaries either follow a political boundary (country boundary, province boundary, etc.), or coastlines.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=ix}} The scheme also aims to follow botanical tradition, in terms of the distribution categories used in works like the ''[[Flora Europaea]]'', ''[[Flora Malesiana]]'', or Med-Checklist.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=xiii}} This approach occasionally leads to departures from political boundaries. Thus the scheme follows ''Flora Europaea''&lt;ref name=FE&gt;{{Cite book |year=1993 |editor-last=Tutin |editor-first=T.G |editor2-last=Burges |editor2-first=N.A. |editor3-last=Chater |editor3-first=A.O. |editor4-last=Edmondson |editor4-first=J.R. |editor5-last=Heywood |editor5-first=V.H. |editor6-last=Moore |editor6-first=D.M. |editor7-last=Valentine |editor7-first=D.H. |editor8-last=Walters |editor8-first=S.M. |editor9-last=Webb |editor9-first=D.A. |title=Flora Europaea : Volume 1 |edition=2nd |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-41007-6 |lastauthoramp=yes |page=xxiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; in placing the eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] islands (such as [[Lesbos]], [[Samos]] and [[Rhodes]]) in the West Asia region,{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=26}} rather than in Europe where they belong politically as part of Greece.

===Levels===
The scheme defines geographic places at four scales or levels, from "botanical continents" down to parts of large countries:{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pages=xi,19}}
# Continental – nine botanical continents
# Regional – each botanical continent is divided into between two and ten sub-continental regions
# Area or "botanical country" – most regions are subdivided into units generally equating to a political country, but large countries may be split or outlying areas omitted
# "Basic recording units" – the lowest level is only used for very large countries, subdividing them into states or provinces on purely political grounds
Standardized codes are used to represent the units at each level. Numerical codes are used for Levels 1 and 2, alphabetic codes for Levels 3 and 4.

===Phytogeography===
For more botanically oriented classifications using [[phytogeography]], the scheme's documentation endorses the use of [[:Category:Floristic kingdoms|floristic kingdoms]], [[:Category:Floristic regions|floristic regions]], and [[:Category:Floristic provinces|floristic provinces]], as classified by [[Armen Takhtajan]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|page=v|ps=, citing A. Takhtajan (1986). Floristic Regions of the World.}}

==Level 1: botanical continents==
{{anchor|Levels 1 and 2}}
[[File:WGSRPD World.svg|thumb|upright=2|Botanical continents as defined by the WGSRPD]]
The WGSRPD defines nine botanical continents (Level 1), each assigned a single digit code from 1 (Europe) to 9 (Antarctica). Although it is said that "popular concepts of the continents of the world have been maintained, but with one or two slight modifications",{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=xi}} some of the botanical continents are notably different from the traditional [[continent|geographical continents]]. In particular, Asia is divided into two botanical continents; 5 Australasia consists only of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] and small outlying islands; most of the islands in the [[Pacific Ocean]] are allocated to 6 Pacific; and the division of the Americas into 7 Northern America and 8 Southern America differs from the traditional [[North America]] and [[South America]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=xi}}

===1 Europe===

The botanical continent of Europe is defined broadly in line with ''Flora Europaea''&lt;ref name=FE/&gt; and with the [[Europe|traditional geographical definition]]. To the north-west it includes [[Iceland]] and [[Svalbard]] (Spitsbergen). The southern boundary with Africa encloses most of the Mediterranean islands. The eastern boundary places [[Crimea]] and [[European Russia]] in Europe, with the border defined by the administrative units. [[Novaya Zemlya]] is excluded from Europe. The south-eastern boundary excludes the [[Caucasus]] and [[Turkey]] east of the [[Bosphorus]], as well as the Eastern [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] Islands and [[Cyprus]], which although politically part of Europe are considered floristically part of Western Asia.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=107}}

===2 Africa===

The botanical continent of Africa corresponds closely to the usual geographical definition. It excludes the [[Sinai Peninsula]], politically part of [[Egypt]], which is placed in region 34 Western Asia. To the west, it includes islands grouped as  [[Macaronesia]], comprising the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], and the [[Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]. To the east, it includes [[Madagascar]] and other [[Indian Ocean]] islands out as far as the island of [[Rodrigues]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=109}}

===3 Asia-Temperate===
&lt;!--[[Asia-Temperate]] redirects here, so leave an anchor if the section title is changed.--&gt;
The geographical continent of [[Asia]] is divided into two botanical continents, 3 Asia-Temperate and 4 Asia-Tropical. The reason for the division was described as largely for convenience.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=xi}} Asia-Temperate borders Europe and Africa; the boundaries are described above. To the south-east, the [[Indian subcontinent|Indian Subcontinent]] and the rest of Asia from region 41 [[Indo-China]] southwards are placed in Asia-Tropical.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pp=104–105}}

===4 Asia-Tropical===
&lt;!--[[Asia-Tropical]] redirects here, so leave an anchor if the section title is changed.--&gt;
Asia-Tropical forms the second part of the traditional geographical continent of Asia. Its western and northern boundaries are formed by the two regions 40 Indian Subcontinent and 41 Indo-China. The southern boundary separates Asia-Tropical from [[Australia]]. The south-eastern boundary was changed between the first edition of 1992 and the second edition of 2001. In the first edition, Asia-Tropical was divided into three regions: 40 Indian Subcontinent, 41 Indo-China and 42 Malesia. The eastern boundary of Malesia was placed between the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and the [[Solomon Islands]], which were put into region 60 Southwest Pacific. It was subsequently argued that it made more "floristic sense" to link the Solomon Islands with the Bismarck Archipelago and the island of [[New Guinea]]. Accordingly, in the second edition, a new region 43 [[Papuasia]] was created within Asia-Tropical, comprising New Guinea, the Bismarck Archipelago and the Solomon Islands, so that Asia-Tropical consists of four regions.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pp=6, 104–105}}

===5 Australasia===
The botanical continent of Australasia, as defined by the WGSRPD, consists only of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]], plus outlying islands. The name was described as having been "controversial", since it has been used to describe larger areas.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pp=xi–x}} [[Australasia|Other definitions]] may include [[Indonesia]], [[New Guinea]] and many Pacific islands, which the WGSRPD divides between 4 Asia-Tropical and 6 Pacific.

===6 Pacific===
The WGSRPD groups most islands with a nearby continental landmass, usually the closest but also influenced by the similarity of the flora. The exception is the islands of the central part of the [[Pacific Ocean]], which are placed in a separate botanical continent. The largest of these islands include [[New Caledonia]], [[Fiji]] and [[Hawaii]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pp=45–46, 123}}

===7 Northern America===
The WGSRPD divides the Americas into 7 Northern America and 8 Southern America rather than into the traditional continents of [[North America]] and [[South America]]. The boundary between Northern America and Southern America was changed from the first edition to the second edition. In the first edition, a south-eastern part of [[Mexico]] was included in Southern America, the rest of Mexico being placed in Northern America. This followed the boundary of Mesoamerica in ''Flora Mesoamericana''. However, it proved unpopular, especially with Mexican botanists, so in the second edition, all of Mexico is placed in Northern America, which thus consists of Mexico, the [[contiguous United States]] plus Alaska, Canada, and [[Greenland]], together with associated offshore islands.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pp=7, 19, 125}}

===8 Southern America===
As noted [[#7 Northern America|above]], the Americas are divided into 7 Northern America and 8 Southern America rather than into the traditional continents of North America and South America, with the precise boundary between the two having changed between the first and second editions of the WGSRPD. Southern America consists of the [[Caribbean]], the WGSRPD definition of [[Central America]] (those countries south of Mexico and north of [[Colombia]]), and the traditional geographical continent of South America, together with some offshore islands, such as the [[Galapagos]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|pp=7, 49–52}}

===9 Antarctic===
The Antarctic botanical continent consists of continental [[Antarctica]], plus a number of Subantarctic Islands, including the [[Falkland Islands]], [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]] and [[Tristan da Cunha]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=52}}

==Level 2: subcontinental regions==
The nine botanical continents (Level 1) are each divided into between two and ten Level 2 regions; see the table above. Each region is given a two digit code, the first digit being that of the Level 1 continent to which it belongs. Altogether, there are 52 regions.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=19}}

Many of the regions are geographical divisions of the continents, e.g. 12 Southwestern Europe, 34 Western Asia or 77 South-Central U.S.A. Others are whole countries within the continents, e.g. 36 China, 79 Mexico or 84 Brazil.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=19}} Some less well-known regions include:
* 21 [[Macaronesia]], consisting of the [[Azores]], the [[Canary Islands]], and [[Madeira]], plus associated smaller islands{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=37}}
* 38 Eastern Asia, consisting of [[Japan]], [[Korea]], and [[Taiwan]], plus associated smaller islands{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=42}} – the usual geographical unit [[East Asia]] is much larger
* 42 [[Malesia]], consisting of peninsular Malaya, [[Borneo]], [[Sumatra]], [[Java]], and [[the Philippines]], plus associated smaller islands{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=43–44}}
* 43 [[Papuasia]], consisting of the island of [[New Guinea]], the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] and the [[Solomon Islands]]{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=44}}

==Levels 3 and 4: areas and basic recording units==
Levels 3 and 4 are identified by letter codes. Three letter codes are used for Level 3;{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=xiii}} e.g. "NWG" stands for [[New Guinea]].{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=32}} Where the Level 3 area is subdivided into Level 4 "basic recording units", a two letter code is appended;{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=xiv}} thus "NWG-IJ" represents [[Irian Jaya]],{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=58}} the [[Indonesia]]n part of New Guinea. Where the Level 3 area is not subdivided, "OO" may be added to create a five letter code to show that the Level 4 unit is identical to the Level 3 area.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=xiv}} Thus "BIS" represents the [[Bismarck Archipelago]] at Level 3. This area is not subdivided, so "BIS-OO" can be used to represent it at Level 4.{{sfnp|Brummitt|2001|p=44}} As an example, the complete division of the Level 2 Papuasia region is shown below.

{| class="wikitable"

==Usage==
Organizations and works using the scheme include the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN),&lt;ref name=use&gt;{{cite web |title=Who Is Using This Standard |website=Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) |url=http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109/usageInfo/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713195024/http://www.tdwg.org/standards/109/usageInfo/ |accessdate=2015-08-02 |archivedate=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Germplasm Resources Information Network]] (GRIN), and the [[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] (WCSP), published by [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew|Kew]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/about.do | title=About the Checklist |work=World Checklist of Selected Plant Families |publisher=Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew |accessdate=2008-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus in the GRIN Taxonomy for Plants database, the distribution of ''[[Magnolia grandiflora]]'' is given in terms of WGSRPD botanical continents and regions as:&lt;ref&gt;{{GRIN | ''Magnolia grandiflora'' | 23108 | accessdate = 2015-07-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"Northern America
::Southeastern U.S.A.
::South-Central U.S.A."
Below the Level 2 regions, the Level 3 areas in this case are US states.

The World Checklist of Selected Plant Families uses the WGSRPD numeric codes for Levels 2 and 3. Hence to this degree of detail it gives the distribution of ''Magnolia grandiflora'' as "77 78 (79) (81) (85)".&lt;ref name=WCSP_117615&gt;{{cite web |title=''Magnolia grandiflora'' |work=[[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/namedetail.do?name_id=117615 |accessdate=2015-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Level 2 codes 77 and 78 are South-Central U.S.A. and Southeastern U.S.A respectively; the absence of parentheses shows that the species is [[Native plant|native]] to these regions. Parentheses around codes are used in the WCSP to show that the species is [[Naturalisation (biology)|naturalized]] rather than native. Hence the species is naturalized in 79 (Mexico), 81 (Caribbean) and 85 (Southern South America).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Geographical Distribution |work=[[World Checklist of Selected Plant Families]] |publisher=[[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] |url=http://apps.kew.org/wcsp/about.do#geography |accessdate=2015-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
