The '''1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts robbery''', sometimes called the '''Skylight Caper''',&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sezgin|first1=Catherine Schofield|title=The Skylight Caper: The Unsolved 1972 Theft of the Montreal Museum of  Fine Arts|journal=The Journal of Art Crime|date=Fall 2010|issue=4|pages=57–68|url=http://www.artcrimeresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/JAC-Fall-2010-eVersion-Final.pdf|accessdate=August 27, 2017|issn=1947-5934}}&lt;/ref&gt; took place very early in the morning of September 4 of that year. Three [[armed robbery|armed robbers]] used a [[skylight]] under repair to gain entry to [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|the museum]] from its roof, tied up the three guards on duty, and left on foot with 18 paintings, including a rare [[Rembrandt]] [[Landscape painting|landscape]] and works by [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]], [[Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], and [[Thomas Gainsborough]], as well as some [[figurine]]s and jewellery. One of the Brueghels was returned by the thieves as an initiative to start [[ransom]] negotiations. None of the other paintings has ever been recovered and the robbers have never been arrested or even publicly identified, although there is at least one informal suspect.

Collectively, the missing paintings have been valued at $11.7 million in 2017 dollars; although their value may have diminished since the theft as scholars have called the attribution of some of the works into question. However, the Rembrandt alone has been valued at $1 million; in 2003 ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' estimated it to have appreciated in value to $20 million. The thieves appeared to know what works they were looking for; many of the works had been part of ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that had been to many museums in the U.S. and Canada prior to [[Expo 67]], as well as some other special exhibits put on by the museum in the preceding years. It is not only the largest [[art theft]] in Canada but the largest theft in Canadian history.&lt;ref name="CBC digital archives story"&gt;{{cite news|title=1972: Art heist at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/1972-art-heist-at-the-montreal-museum-of-fine-arts|newspaper=[[CBC News]]|date=September 4, 1972|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canadaartsconnect.com/2014/09/art-theft-montreal-museum-fine-arts-1972/|title=Today in Canadian Art History: The Largest Art Theft in Canadian History Occurred at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts / Musée des beaux-arts de Montréal|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 31, 2017|publisher=Canada Arts Connect|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720185443/http://canadaartsconnect.com/2014/09/art-theft-montreal-museum-fine-arts-1972/|archive-date=2017-07-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation of the crime proved difficult in the early going, since it occurred over the [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] holiday weekend, when many of the museum's officials including its director were vacationing far away from [[Montreal]]. It was further complicated by continuing news coverage of the [[Blue Bird Café fire]], Montreal's deadliest [[arson]], three days earlier, dominating the headlines; the next day the [[Munich massacre|killings of Israeli athletes by Palestinian terrorists]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics|Olympics]] in [[Munich]] further diminished media coverage. A [[sting operation]] conceived after the thieves returned the Brueghel (later reattributed to his students) and mailed photos of the other works to the museum seeking a ransom payment went awry; a later attempt to negotiate their return cost the museum $10,000 with no results.

The thieves took advantage of weakened security, resulting from the renovations at the museum, which had left the skylight's alarm disabled. The renovations and the security flaws were themselves a consequence of the museum's tightening finances, which had worsened during the 1960s as many of the wealthy [[English-speaking Quebecers|Anglophone]] community in Montreal that had supported the museum since its founding in 1860 began to leave for [[Toronto]] due to increasing concerns over [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]],&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Unsolved '72 Theft of Montreal Museum of Fine Arts|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially after terrorist acts by the [[Front de libération du Québec]] had led to [[October Crisis|martial law in the Montreal area]] two years earlier. [[Sûreté du Québec]], the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] and [[Interpol]] continue to investigate the crime. Theories as to who might be responsible have ranged from the [[Montreal Mafia]] to Quebec separatists.

==Background==
[[File:New Art Gallery Building, Montreal 06.jpg|thumb|right|The Hornstein Pavilion, the original museum building, in 2013|alt=A three-story light stone building with a flat green-trimmed roof from which the Canadian, Quebec and Montreal flags are flying from poles at the center, seen from a three-quarters angle about midway up its height from across an intersection. On its front face is a recessed entry area with four fluted columns topped by Corinthian capitals. Banners to either side have the word "Chihuly", and the entablature has "Montreal Museum of Fine Arts" and "Musée de Beaux Art du Montréal in capital metal letters]]
The [[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]] (MMFA) was established in 1860 as the Art Association of Montreal, to encourage art appreciation in the city. It did not start to exhibit works until the late 1870s and 1880s, when wealthy patrons who had prospered from Canada's [[industrialization]] began to donate both cash and works, and it was soon able to build Canada's first space explicitly intended for the exhibition of art. In 1913 it built what is currently its main building, now known as the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion, on Sherbrooke Street in the neighborhood known even today as the [[Golden Square Mile]], because it was home to many of the wealthiest and most successful families in Canada.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part II: 'The Skylight Caper' |url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-ii-skylight-caper.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These [[patronage|patrons]] were predominantly of British descent, all members of Montreal's [[English-speaking Quebecers|Anglophone]] elite. At the end of the 1950s, their political and economic domination of the city began to yield to its majority [[Québécois people|Francophone]] population, as [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Quebec separatism]] began to gain political influence in the province as a whole. Fearing the consequences should the province succeed in seceding, and mindful of the terrorist attacks of the [[Front de libération du Québec]] which had led to [[October Crisis|martial law being declared in the city in 1970]],&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; the Anglophone elite began leaving the city over the course of the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt;

This slowly deprived the museum of much of its traditional financial support. In 1957, Bill Bantey, a former journalist who was appointed the museum's head of [[public relations]], began reaching out for the first time in its history to Francophones, with some success. But the contributions from newer philanthropists in the city were not as much as their predecessors had been able to give, and public funds from the province only covered 40 percent of the museum's annual budget.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt;

As a result, the museum was having to cut back financially in the early 1970s, going from a strictly private institution to a semi-public [[nonprofit organization]].&lt;ref name="Museum history page"&gt;{{cite web|title=History of MMFA 1860–2016|url=https://www.mbam.qc.ca/en/about-the-museum/history-of-the-mmfa-1860-2016/|publisher=[[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]]|date=2017|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum needed to expand, and it needed to renovate the 1913 [[William Sutherland Maxwell]] [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] building on Sherbrooke Street. The latter was particularly unsuited to the demands of a late-20th century art museum, with many cramped rooms and corridors.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 2" /&gt; The museum planned to close it in 1973 for a three-year renovation project.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 6"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part VI: Closing the museum and another ransom demand|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-vi-closing-museum-and-another.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Previous thefts and attempts===

On two prior occasions thieves took, or attempted to take, works from the museum.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

One night in 1933, a person who had hidden in the museum overnight passed 14 paintings, mostly by Canadian artists, to someone else through an open window in the women's lavatory. Later the museum received a ransom note asking $10,000 for the return of the paintings. Three months later, the English-language ''[[Montreal Star]]'' and the French ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' each received half of one of the paintings in the mail. A note along with them said if a ransom of 25 percent of the remaining paintings' total value was not paid, they too would be returned in pieces.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The paintings were recovered before that could occur when Paul Thouin, a petty criminal, was arrested after burglarizing a rail freight car. During interrogation, he confessed to stealing the paintings and led police to where he had buried them, wrapped in a [[tarpaulin]] with newspapers, in a one-metre-deep (3&amp;nbsp;ft) sandpit near the village of [[L'Épiphanie, Quebec (town)|L'Épiphanie]] a short distance northeast of Montreal. Thouin, who had shot and killed a police officer attempting to apprehend him in a railroad warehouse, was reportedly terrified at the prospect of being returned to prison for what would likely be a very long time. He committed suicide by [[Strychnine poisoning|poisoning himself with a concealed dose of strychnine]] in the police lockup that night, before he could stand trial.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

A gang of armed robbers attempted to steal some [[van Gogh]] paintings during a special exhibition of the artist's work at the museum in 1960. They were foiled and escaped. They have never been identified.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Labour Day weekend 1972 in Montreal===

In Montreal, [[Labour Day#Canada|Labour Day]] weekend of 1972 began with two major news events, neither of them positive. On the night of Friday, September 1, four men who had been refused entry to a downtown country-and-western bar for being too intoxicated retaliated by [[arson|setting the club's steps afire]]; [[Blue Bird Café fire|the ensuing blaze]] killed 37, making it the deadliest fire in the city in 45 years.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; On the following evening, the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet national hockey team]] defeated [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|their Canadian counterparts]] 7–3 in the first game of the [[Summit Series]] at the  [[Montreal Forum]].&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt; Canadians, who had expected their team, composed of [[National Hockey League]] stars, to overwhelmingly defeat the Soviets, who had only begun competing in international ice hockey a quarter-century earlier, at what Canadians considered their national sport were stunned.&lt;ref name="Summit Series game 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Red|authorlink=Red Fisher (journalist)|title=Summit Series Game 1: Canada reels at shocking loss|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/sports/summit+series+game+canada+reels+shocking+loss/7176790/story.html|newspaper=[[Montreal Gazette]]|date=September 3, 2012|accessdate=August 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fans in Montreal were eagerly looking ahead to the next game in the series, to be held Monday evening in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt;

At the museum, the board president, director, and director of security were all on vacation in either the [[United States]] or [[Mexico]] for the holiday weekend. Bantey, the public relations director, was the most senior official in charge.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Robbery==

Shortly after midnight on the morning of September 4, police believe, a group of three men gathered out in front of the museum on [[Sherbrooke Street]]. They went to the museum's west wall, between it and the [[Church of St. Andrew and St. Paul]]. One of the men, who had the same sort of pick-equipped boots used by utility-company workers to climb telephone poles, went up a tree next to the museum and got high enough in it to gain access to the roof. He was able to find a ladder, and lowered it to the other two, who climbed up.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Once the group was on the roof, they went to a [[skylight]] that had been covered by a plastic sheet in the course of some ongoing work. They opened the skylight, without setting off any alarm as the plastic sheet had rendered it inoperative, and lowered a {{convert|15|m|ft|adj=on}} [[nylon]] rope to the museum's second floor. All three slid down.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It had taken them almost an hour and a half to gain entry to the museum. Shortly after they did, around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., one of the three guards on duty was walking to the kitchen to get some tea. He encountered the thieves, their faces covered by [[ski mask]]s, who fired both barrels of a [[pump action]] shotgun into the ceilings to get his attention and made him lie down on the floor. The noise brought the other two guards, who were unable to resist, and soon all three guards were taken to a lecture hall where they were bound and gagged.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

There, one of the robbers, who carried a .38-caliber [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] handgun,&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site" /&gt; stood guard while the other two removed paintings, jewellery and figurines from their displays and brought them to the museum's shipping department. The thieves originally seemed to have planned to leave via the same skylight they had come in through, but eventually they concluded it would take too much time to put together a system of [[pulley]]s to get themselves and the stolen artwork out. After finding that one of the guards had a set of keys to one of the museum's [[panel truck]]s, they decided instead to flee that way.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, this alternative also went awry. They chose to exit through one of the museum's side entrances, where an alarm went off as they did so. Leaving half their take behind, they fled on foot down Sherbrooke.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Back in the museum, one of the guards worked to free himself. An hour after the robbery ended, around 3 a.m., he succeeded and called Bill Bantey, who told him to call the police. He arrived shortly after the police, along with Ruth Jackson, the museum's curator of decorative arts. After surveying the broken frames, smashed display cases and general disorder the thieves had left, they found that 18 paintings and 38 other pieces had been taken. Collectively they estimated the value of the stolen work at $2 million.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Works stolen==
[[File:Rembrandt- landscape with cottages - stolen.jpg|right|thumb|Rembrandt's ''Landscape with Cottages'', the most valuable of the stolen works, seen here in a black-and-white image from the artist's 1968 [[catalogue raisonné]].|alt=A slightly sepia-toned image of a painting showing a cottage surrounded by dark trees under an overcast late-evening sky]]
All of the stolen paintings were by European artists from the 17th through 19th centuries:

*''Landscape with Vehicles and Cattle'', attributed at the time to [[Jan Brueghel the Elder]] but later reattributed to his students (subsequently recovered)
*''Landscape with Buildings and Wagon'', Jan Brueghel the Elder
*''La rêveuse á la fontaine'' (''The Dreaming Woman at the Fountain''), [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot]]
*''Jeune fille accoudée sur le bras gauche'' (''Young Girl Leaning on Her Left Arm''), Corot
*''Landscape with rocks and stream'', [[Gustave Courbet]]
*''Head'', [[Honoré Daumier]]
*''Lioness and Lion in a Cave'', [[Eugène Delacroix]]
*''The Sorceress'', [[Narcisse Virgilio Díaz]]
*''Portrait of Brigadier General Sir Thomas Fletcher'', [[Thomas Gainsborough]]
*''Still Life: Vanitas'', [[Jan Davidsz de Heem]]
*''Still Life with a Fish'', de Heem
*''La barrateuse'' (''Young Woman Churning''), [[Jean-François Millet]]
*''Portrait of Madame Millet'', Millet
*''Portrait of a Man, Possibly a Self-portrait'', [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]]
*''Landscape with Cottages'', [[Rembrandt van Rijn]]
*''Head of a Young Man'', [[Peter Paul Rubens]]
*''Portrait of a Lady'', [[François-André Vincent]]
*''Portrait of a Man'', Vincent

Most of the paintings taken were small works around a foot (31&amp;nbsp;cm) along their longest dimension; the three smallest (the Brueghels and Millet's ''La barrateuse'') were less than {{convert|80|sqin}}, smaller than a standard [[Letter (paper size)|letter-size]] piece of paper. The largest was the Courbet, at 28{{frac|7|8}} by 36{{frac|1|8}} inches ({{convert|28.875|by|36.125|in|cm|disp=output only}}), with the Gainsborough and Corot's ''Dreamer'' close behind. It was possible that when the thieves ran away each of them held a batch of smaller paintings in one hand and a larger one in the other.&lt;ref name="Cathy Sezgin's site page 5"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part V: Comparable Crimes and the 'Masterpieces from Montreal'|url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-v-comparable-crimes-and.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thieves also took 38 pieces of jewellery and figurines. Among the former pieces were an 18th-century gold watch once owned by the wife of [[Jacques Viger (1787–1858)|Jacques Viger]], Montreal's first mayor; a 19th-century French blue enamel latch box set with diamonds and two 17th-century Spanish pendants.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Investigation==

Later that morning, Bantey, who had covered the crime beat in Montreal as a journalist prior to his tenure at the museum, held a [[news conference]] to discuss the theft. He identified all the stolen works and described how the robbers had entered the museum and taken them. "They did show quite discriminating taste," he told reporters, "though as far as the objects are concerned, they could do with more art and historical training." In their haste to leave, he noted, the thieves had left behind another Rembrandt as well as works by [[El Greco]], [[Pablo Picasso|Picasso]] and [[Tintoretto]] that they could as easily have taken.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The news conference was initially effective in publicizing the theft. It, as well as lists of the stolen paintings, were reported as front-page news in many major newspapers across the U.S. and Canada the next morning. As soon as they learned of the theft, Montreal police had also put out the alert to the crossings along the [[Canada–United States border|U.S. border]], about {{convert|60|km}} from Montreal, to look out for the thieves and/or the paintings should anyone attempt to take them to [[New York City]], {{convert|330|mi|km|disp=flip}} farther south.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, further publicity that might have drawn attention to the theft and perhaps helped solve it was stymied by news events of September 5. At that year's [[1972 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]], [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian terrorists]] with [[Black September]] took 11 Israeli athletes hostage, eventually [[Munich massacre|killing them]] along with a German police officer, the following day. Those events were of particular interest in Montreal since the city was preparing to host [[1976 Summer Olympics|the next Olympics]], and as a result further news about the art theft got less priority in the media. The investigation would continue, however.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

From interviews with the three guards, police learned that there had been three thieves. The guards saw two of them, describing them as both about {{convert|5|ft|6|in|cm}} in height. One spoke French and the other English. The guards also reported that the two spoke with a third, also a Francophone, whom they never were able to see.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Investigators were immediately struck by the similarity to another recent art theft in the Montreal area. On August 30, another group of three thieves had broken into the summer home of Agnes Meldrum, wife of a Montreal moving-company owner, in [[Oka, Quebec|Oka]], roughly 30 kilometres (20 miles) west of the city. They had all climbed up a 200-metre (600-foot) cliff from a powerboat on [[Lake of Two Mountains]] to do so. Witnesses said that while they wore hoods to prevent identification, two spoke French and the other, English. Once inside the home they stole paintings worth $50,000 in total.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Inside-job theory===

The presence of two Francophones and one Anglophone, plus the climbing skills involved, led the chief investigator on the case to believe the thieves involved in both incidents had been local, and possibly the same. That, and their apparent knowledge of the skylight's non-functional alarm, had at first fostered a theory that someone on the inside at the museum had aided the thieves in some way. This is a common phenomenon when museums are robbed; two [[New York City Police Department|New York City detectives]] who specialized in [[art theft|art crime]] said as much when commenting about the Montreal case later in 1972.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

However, the Montreal police considered that speculation too broad to be helpful in focusing their investigation, and evidence did not bear it out. While it was possible that the thieves had indeed actively involved someone working on the skylight, it was as possible that they, or others involved with them, had learned of the security flaw through an overheard remark somewhere. An intense investigation of the workers involved with the skylight did not find any evidence they had passed information about it to anyone criminally inclined.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It was also seen as possible that the robbers had learned of the skylight flaw by simply [[Reconnaissance|reconnoitering]] their target. Roughly two weeks before the theft, someone reported encountering two men sitting on chairs on the roof, wearing sunglasses and smoking. When asked by the person who reported the incident, they claimed to be museum employees. But when investigators looked for the chairs on the roof after the theft, they could not be found. Likewise, no fingerprints or other evidence was left on either the ladder or nylon rope.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Theories of an inside job were also undermined by the thieves' poorly planned exit. After abandoning their improvised plan to leave by the same skylight when they realized it would take too long to set up a system of [[pulley]]s, they instead chose to try to flee in one of the museum's trucks. If they had based that alternative on inside information they had obtained, they would have known how to disable the alarm they set off on the side entrance before opening it. And even if they had not chosen to do so, they would have known it did not sound anywhere else besides the museum—and thus not have abandoned half of what they had stolen to escape on foot.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Selection of works===

While the jewellery and figurines seem to have been chosen only because they could be easily carried, the paintings stolen seem to have been a matter of choice. Their small size, in addition to making them easy to carry and conceal, would also facilitate quick sales. The robbers, and any dealer working with them, might, investigators have speculated, have been looking to sell to private collectors who display their paintings in their homes. Indeed, the pairs of small paintings with similar subject matter by the same artist—Brueghel, Corot, Millet and Vincent—would be excellent choices to decorate a room.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Interest in art in recent years had driven up prices, a phenomenon which had been widely reported in both French- and English-language media, and the thieves would have known even if they had no interest in art what collectors were willing to pay large sums for. Some [[art dealer]]s in the Montreal area refused to discuss their business with police absent a legal order such as a [[subpoena]] or [[warrant (law)|warrant]]. Around Christmas 1972, a ''[[Montreal Gazette]]'' columnist reported that, in fact, most of the paintings had been delivered to the homes of wealthy collectors in [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Mount Royal]], with a small portion diverted to the U.S. This led police to interrogate two unnamed individuals, but no new leads developed as a result.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The robbers might not even have had to visit the museum to decide what works to take. Half of those they did keep when they ran away had been in ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a [[travelling exhibition]] that had been to several cities in the U.S. during the year before [[Expo 67]]. The Rembrandt had been included in a 1969 exhibit to commemorate the tricentennial of the artist's death, and the following year many of the French paintings had been in another exhibit that the press in that language gave great attention to.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

All those works in the special exhibitions would have been depicted in handbooks or catalogues produced in association with them. Only the Brueghels, the Rubens and the Vincent portraits had not been included in those exhibits nor mentioned in any publication save the museum's own catalogue.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

===Possible early suspects===

Early in their investigation, the police began looking into a group of students at the nearby [[École des beaux-arts de Montréal]]. Mostly French-speaking, they had often visited the museum but had frequently been asked to leave before its official closing time so that the mostly English-speaking staff could [[Tea (meal)|take their tea]]. This had engendered considerable resentment on the students' part.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Police kept five of these students under 24-hour [[surveillance]] for two weeks. Eventually they decided they could not find any evidence, and dropped that part of the investigation. Alain Lacoursière, an art-theft specialist with the Montreal police who investigated the [[cold case]] in later years,&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; by his own account taking it over just before the files were slated to be shredded in 1984,&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post" /&gt; believes the students were not involved. "This crime was organized with a guy in charge who was 35 to 40 years old," well past his student years, he said in 2010.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Ransom negotiations and recovery attempts==

In many art thefts the thieves seek ransom payments in return for the stolen works, and this happened twice in the MMFA thefts. Within a week of the robbery museum director David Giles Carter received a phone call from, he believed, one of the thieves. A man with a gravelly voice and an accent Carter described as "European" gave him directions to a phone booth near [[McGill University]], near which one of the stolen pendants was found.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Soon afterwards, a brown manila [[Port of Montreal]] envelope arrived at the museum with snapshots of the stolen paintings. Carter nicknamed the thief "Port of Montreal" as a result, and dialogue was opened up between the museum and the thieves to negotiate a ransom. At first the thieves demanded $500,000, about a quarter of the works' stated value; later they halved that.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;
[[File:Montreal Central Station.JPG|right|thumb|Montreal Central Station, where one of the stolen paintings was found, in 2008|alt=A dark modern brick building with lighter buildings rising to the top of the image behind it. On a corner in front is signage in French advertising offices for rent in the building]]
Carter demanded the thieves, or whoever it was negotiating on their behalf, give more proof they had the paintings than snapshots. In response, they told the museum's security director to go to a locker in [[Montreal Central Station]]. Inside, he found the Brueghel ''Landscape with Buildings and Wagon''. It is the only one of the stolen paintings that has so far been recovered.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

As a result of these negotiations, approximately a month later the museum's insurance companies and the Montreal police set up a [[sting operation]]. An undercover detective posed as an [[Claims adjuster|insurance adjustor]] and agreed to meet the thieves or their representative in an empty field in one of the city's suburbs, where he hoped the thieves would believe he was ready to hand over $5,000 for another one of the paintings. However, when one of the local police cruisers passed by, completely unaware of the plans, the thieves apparently came to realize what was actually going on and never met the undercover officer. The next day they called Carter and complained that they had been set up.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière believes that it was actually the museum and the police who were being set up. The field the robbers had chosen as the meeting site had few nearby houses at the time and could easily have been monitored from some distance away, allowing the robbers to detect even the more subtle police presence necessary to support a sting operation. "It was all a smokescreen", he says. Since the thieves never reopened negotiations afterwards, he believes they never had any intention of returning the paintings at the time and were using the purported ransom negotiations as a [[Feint|diversion]] while they bought themselves more time to sell or otherwise dispose of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The second attempt took place the following year. A few months after the museum closed for its three-year renovation project in May 1973, a caller to a member of the museum's board said he would share where the paintings were hidden for $10,000. André DeQuoy, one of the adjusters handling the case, was involved in the discussion and made it clear that while the insurance companies would pay for information leading to the discovery of the painting, they would not pay for the paintings themselves. After he agreed to deliver it personally to the source, the board made the money available.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The caller had instructed DeQuoy, who was being discreetly followed by police, to go to a certain phone booth in [[downtown Montreal]] one afternoon. From there the caller sent him to other phone booths elsewhere in the city, such as the [[Blue Bonnets (raceway)|Blue Bonnets]] race track, on [[Saint Laurent Boulevard|St. Laurent Boulevard]] and at the [[Henri-Bourassa station]] on the [[Montreal Metro]]. The caller then informed DeQuoy that he had picked up the police tail and DeQuoy was to return to his office and await further instructions while the caller had the unmarked car called off.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

DeQuoy did, and an hour later the caller said the police had been taken care of. Again he was sent out to phone booths, ultimately traveling back and forth across the [[island of Montreal]] to 11 of them, until at 4 a.m. the next morning he was told he could leave the envelope at the base of a sign in a vacant lot on St. Martin Boulevard, then return to the Henri-Bourassa phone booth where the caller would contact him again with the location of the paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

While DeQuoy waited for the call, he let the police know where he had been all night. But the caller never called, so the adjustor returned to his office. At 8 a.m. the caller called him there and told him the paintings were in a motel in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], north of Montreal. An intensive search of the building, however, produced neither the paintings nor any sign they had ever been there. The $10,000 was not recovered.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==Later developments==

Due to the minimal news coverage, in January 1973 Bill Bantey put together a circular, ''Attention: Stolen'', depicting the stolen paintings and giving information such as their dimensions, in English and French. The idea was to distribute it widely throughout the international art community and familiarize possible buyers with the stolen works, a practice that was not common in art thefts at the time as most museums preferred to keep the news of their victimization to themselves. Major [[auction]] houses like [[Sotheby's]] and [[Christie's]] would not routinely check for whether art offered for sale through them was on lists of stolen works until 1985. "[We hope that] the works become so catalogued and so well-known that it would be unlikely that any collector or museum buyer could innocently purchase them," Bantey told the ''[[Montreal Gazette|Gazette]]''.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The museum and investigators did not make the ransom negotiations in the year after the thefts public knowledge until ten years later. "For years we thought our chances of recovery were better keeping everything quiet," said one police detective, explaining the decision. "But now our hopes are small. Maybe this will stimulate interest and produce something." But while it did allow police to confirm what they have only described as "certain facts", those have apparently not led to any progress in the case.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The recovered Brueghel was kept in storage at the museum by Ruth Jackson for ten years until a new frame could be purchased, after which it was returned to the place it had been exhibited prior to the theft. However, it was later determined that it was not by Brueghel but one of his students; Lacoursière believes the thieves may have chosen to return it due to doubts about its authenticity. It nevertheless remains on exhibit.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

A similar fate befell the painting the museum bought with the money it received from its insurers. A group of 20 of them paid out nearly $2 million to settle the claim; they in turn posted a $50,000 reward for the return of the paintings, which under the terms of the insurance policies they legally owned as a result of paying the theft claim. The museum used the money to purchase a [[Peter Paul Rubens|Rubens]], ''The Leopards'',&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; which the museum promoted as the largest Rubens exhibited in Canada. But like the Brueghel, it was later reattributed to the painter's assistants, after a [[art conservation|conservationist]] determined that its red pigments were mixed four decades after Rubens' death,&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part One: Alain Lacoursière's biographer Sylvain Larocque Dedicates Sixth Chapter to The Theft of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.|url=http://thelacoursieresociety.com/retired-quebec-art-cop-alain-lacoursiere/|newspaper=The Lacours/Cière Society|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; reducing its value and interest to museumgoers. On the 35th anniversary of the robbery, in 2007, the museum thus returned it to storage and has never put it on display again.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Even the attribution of some of the stolen work has been called into question. When the de Heems were being prepared for their inclusion in ''Masterpieces from Montreal'', a Parisian [[art history|art historian]] the museum contacted suggested that they were in fact the work of another [[Dutch Golden Age painting|Dutch master]], [[Evert Collier]]. The Rembrandt landscape, while indeed signed and dated by the artist, is one that both he and his students frequently returned to as a subject, and some historians are not entirely confident the painting was his even with the signature. The Gainsborough portrait, too, may in fact be the work of [[Joshua Reynolds]], Gainsborough's rival, since its subject, Thomas Fletcher, is shown wearing a [[Madras]] regimental uniform, which he only started wearing in 1771, three years before his portrait was painted by Reynolds.&lt;ref name="Sezgin site page 8"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part VIII: The theft today |url=http://unsolved-1972-theft-montreal.blogspot.com/p/part-viii-theft-today.html|publisher=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art]]|date=September 4, 2014|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, on the 20th anniversary of the theft, a [[Radio-Canada]] story reported that the insurance companies now considered the paintings' value to have appreciated to $20 million.&lt;ref name="Le crime parfait"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lester|first=Normand|title=Le crime parfait|url=http://archives.radio-canada.ca/sante/criminalite_justice/clips/5010/|newspaper=[[Radio-Canada]]|language=French|date=September 1, 1992|accessdate=August 29, 2017|quote=Vingt ans plus tard, le journaliste Normand Lester révèle les intentions des compagnies d'assurances de relancer l'enquête pour retrouver les toiles volées. Pour y arriver, elles promettent une récompense de 100 000 $ et plus ... Actuellement, les toiles sont évaluées à plus de 12 millions de dollars.}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had consequently increased the reward offer to $100,000. On behalf of the Montreal police, Lacoursière, who began investigating art crime in 1994, offered an additional million in 1999. No one has yet come forward to claim these rewards.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière has had some promising leads over the years that have yielded nothing. He has been told that the paintings, or some of them, are in Italy, and that two Montreal men in the French city of [[Nice]] were possible suspects. One heroin addict he interviewed in [[Vancouver]] seemed to have inside information about the robbery, but everything he knew had been previously reported in the media; when he was asked about two details that police have withheld since only the actual robbers would know them, he was unable to do so.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

==="Smith"===

One lead, however, has not been so easy for Lacoursière to dismiss. In 1998, a dealer he had gotten to know introduced him to a man who has been identified publicly only by the [[pseudonym]] "Smith". Smith told the detective he, too, had been a student at the [[École des beaux-arts de Montréal|École des beaux-arts]] at the time of the theft, explaining to him the tension between the students and museum staff.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

In the course of their initial conversation, Lacoursière quickly came to believe Smith knew a great deal about the robbery, perhaps more than the police did. Although Smith said he had not been one of the five students kept under surveillance afterward, he told the detective that the rope used by the thieves to enter from the skylight was not gray as had been reported at the time, but yellow like the ones used at the school building. However, upon reviewing the original file and talking with one of the original investigators, Lacoursière found that any information on the colour of the rope had been deliberately withheld by police in order to confirm any later confessions or statements by possible suspects. He considered Smith's statements "highly suspicious".&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Lacoursière investigated Smith's background, and found that a year after finishing his five-year course at the school, Smith had spent a quarter of a million dollars to buy himself a house and a local [[woodworking]] company. Lacoursière could not determine how Smith might have acquired that amount of money at such a relatively young age. He implied in 2010 it might have been from selling the stolen work.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

According to Lacoursière, Smith even told him that he would at some point in the future tell him something about the robbery. In 2007, during the filming of "L'Colombe d'art" ("The Colombo of Art"), a Radio-Canada special on his career as an art-theft detective, Lacoursière visited Smith and offered him the million-dollar cheque on camera. Smith, however, simply laughed, and invited the camera crew into his house so they could see for themselves that he had none of the stolen paintings.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

In 2010, Quebec journalist Sylvain Larocque interviewed Smith by telephone. While he again denied any role in the theft himself, he claimed that professors and porters at the [[Université du Québec à Montréal]], which the École des beaux-arts had been merged into in 1969, were behind the robbery. They were possibly, he claimed, the same people behind a robbery at the university a few weeks earlier.&lt;ref name="Sezgin guest blog post" /&gt;

The following year Lacoursière received a link to a video in email from Smith, possibly intended to tease the detective, who by then had retired.&lt;ref name="ARCA video blog post 1"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part One: Suspected art thief uses the Internet to tease retired art crime investigator Alain Lacoursière about the location of the paintings stolen from the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts in 1972|url=https://art-crime.blogspot.com/2011/05/suspected-art-thief-uses-internet-to.html|newspaper=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art|ARCA]] blog|date=May 19, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was a [[Mercedes-Benz]] advertisement from [[Hong Kong]] in which [[bank robbery|bank robbers]] steal a briefcase from a bank vault, then escape in a Mercedes. They elude capture but leave the briefcase behind; inside is a long-lost stolen [[Da Vinci]] painting.&lt;ref name="ARCA video blog post 2"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sezgin|first=Catherine Schofield|title=Part Two: Alain Lacoursière, the Mercedes-Benz Commercial Video, and Madonna and the Yarnwinder|url=http://art-crime.blogspot.com/2011/05/part-two-alain-lacoursiere-mercedes.html|newspaper=[[Association for Research into Crimes against Art|ARCA]] blog|date=May 20, 2011|accessdate=August 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theories of the paintings' current whereabouts==

The robbery is now largely forgotten, except by the insurance companies and police, who continue to search. "Like a death in the family, you have to let it drop," Bantey says.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt; However, in 2009, Paul Lavallée, the museum's director at the time, said it continues to affect the museum, since it might not be able to reclaim the works even if they were recovered. "[W]e would be strapped for funds," he said, even if the insurer offered them to the museum at a discount.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

It is possible the paintings may have been destroyed to prevent them from being used as evidence against those in possession of them. But Lacoursière believes they were likely sold through smaller dealers who may not have known they were stolen, or cared if they did, to collectors who likewise keep them private, especially today, since they cannot sell them. He also notes that [[organized crime|criminal organizations]] have found stolen art useful in other ways. During the 1994–2002 [[Quebec Biker war]], he recalls, he learned that one member of the Montreal-area [[Hell's Angels]] served as a [[Fence (criminal)|fence]] for art thieves, selling stolen art to the [[Italian Mafia]] at 10 percent of its price, who in turn used the names of dead residents of the affluent suburb of [[Westmount, Quebec|Westmount]] on faked [[provenance]] forms.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

While it is not believed likely that the original robbers were affiliated with organized crime, the ransom attempts may point in that direction. The [[Port of Montreal]] envelope in which the snapshots of the stolen art was sent may suggest the involvement of the [[West End Gang]], an Irish-dominated group that is one of Canada's oldest and strongest criminal organizations, which has historically been based in the city's port. Bantey, however, doubts this based on his familiarity with the city's criminal element from his journalism days. "[They] were interested in prostitution and drugs" exclusively at the time, he says, and no one involved would have had the expertise required to pull off the robbery. Nor does he believe the thieves were motivated by separatism or any other political cause, just a desire to enrich themselves.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Despite some suggestions the paintings, assuming they still exist, are still in Montreal, or elsewhere in Canada or the U.S. or Europe, the investigators who will discuss this believe the art has been moved to [[Latin America]]. Lacoursière notes that many of the West End Gang often spend their winters in, and retire to, [[Costa Rica]]. [[Public Forces of Costa Rica|Police there]] have not responded to requests for assistance from their counterparts in Montreal. Bantey believes the paintings are in [[South America]] somewhere. "I've heard several people I respect say that."&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

The police files on the robbery remain closed to public inspection as the case is still considered open.&lt;ref name="Sezgin journal article" /&gt;

Kysterne af Rügen set i aftenrøden efter en stormfuld dag}}, literally "A Seascape: The coast of Rügen seen in evening light after a stormy day") is an 1818 oil on canvas marine painting by [[J.C. Dahl]], measuring 37&amp;nbsp;cm by 58.5&amp;nbsp;cm and now in the [[Danish National Gallery]], which purchased it at auction in 1975. It was his first marine painting and the first work he produced in [[Dresden]]. A signed compositional drawing for it is now in the [[Bergen Museum of Art]].&lt;ref name="utst"&gt;''Johan Christian Dahl 1788-1857: jubileumsutstilling 1988: Nasjonalgalleriet 27. februar-1. mai 1988, Bergen billedgalleri 19. mai-3. juli 1988'' (catalogue no. 25, p. 108) Oslo Nasjonalgalleriet 1988 {{ISBN|8290744056}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work is based on his eight-day journey from Denmark to Germany. He noted in his diary that a storm had come out of nowhere and not ceased before reaching Rügen, making him seasick throughout the voyage. The work was commissioned by [[Christian VIII of Denmark|Prince Christian Frederik]] in 1818 and Dahl was paid for the work in February 1819. After Christian Frederik's death in 1848 it was inherited by his son [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederik]], who immediately gave it to [[Louise Rasmussen|Countess Danner]]. After Frederik's death in 1863 it was sold at auction to a private collector in 1864.&lt;ref name="utst" /&gt;

'''Aerial perspective''' or '''atmospheric perspective''' refers to the effect the atmosphere has on the appearance of an object as it is viewed from a distance. As the distance between an object and a viewer increases, the [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] between the object and its background decreases, and the contrast of any markings or details within the object also decreases. The colours of the object also become less [[saturation (color theory)|saturated]] and shift towards the background colour, which is usually blue, but under some conditions may be some other colour (for example, at sunrise or sunset distant colours may shift towards red).

==History==

Aerial perspective was used in paintings from the Netherlands in the 15th century, and explanations of its effects were with varying degrees of accuracy written by [[polymath]]s such as [[Leon Battista Alberti]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]]. The latter used aerial perspective in many of his paintings such as the [[Mona Lisa]] and [[The Last Supper (Leonardo)|The Last Supper]]. Atmospheric perspective was used in Pompeian Second Style paintings, one of the [[Pompeian Styles]], dating as early as 30 BCE. A notable example is the Gardenscape from the Villa of Livia in Primaporta, Italy.

==Optics==

The major component affecting the appearance of objects during [[daylight]] is [[scattering]] of light, called [[Diffuse sky radiation|skylight]], into the [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]] of the viewer. Scattering occurs from molecules of the air and also from larger particles in the atmosphere such as water vapour and smoke (see [[haze]]). Scattering adds the sky light as a [[veiling luminance]] onto the light from the object, reducing its contrast with the background sky light. Skylight usually contains more light of short [[wavelength]] than other wavelengths (this is why the sky usually appears blue), which is why distant objects appear bluish (see [[Rayleigh scattering]] for detailed explanation). A minor component is scattering of light out of the line of sight of the viewer. Under daylight, this either augments the contrast loss (e.g., for white objects) or opposes it (for dark objects). At night there is effectively no skylight (unless the [[moon]] is very bright), so scattering out of the line of sight becomes the major component affecting the appearance of [[self-luminous]] objects. Such objects have their contrasts reduced with the dark background, and their colours are shifted towards red.

==Why reducing contrast reduces clarity==

The ability of a person with normal [[visual acuity]] to see fine details is determined by his or her [[contrast sensitivity]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, D. H. (1977). Visual contrast sensitivity. Optica Acta, 24, 107-129.&lt;/ref&gt; Contrast sensitivity is the [[Multiplicative inverse|reciprocal]] of the smallest contrast for which a person can [[Contrast (vision)|see]] a sine-wave [[grating]]. A person's [[contrast sensitivity function]] is contrast sensitivity as a function of [[spatial frequency]]. Normally, peak contrast sensitivity is at about 4 cycles per degree of [[visual angle]]. At higher spatial frequencies, comprising finer and finer lines, contrast sensitivity decreases, until at about 40 cycles per degree even the brightest of bright lines and the darkest of dark lines cannot be seen.

The high spatial frequencies in an image give it its fine details.&lt;ref&gt;Blake, R., &amp; Sekuler, R. (2006). Perception (5th ed.). New York: McGraw-Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Reducing the contrast of an image reduces the visibility of these high spatial frequencies because contrast sensitivity for them is already poor. This is how a reduction of contrast can reduce the clarity of an image—by removing its fine details.

It is important to emphasize that reducing the contrast is not the same as [[Focus (optics)|blurring]] an image. Blurring is accomplished by reducing the contrast only of the high spatial frequencies. Aerial perspective reduces the contrast of all spatial frequencies.

==In art==

In art, especially painting, ''aerial perspective''  refers to the technique of creating an illusion of depth by depicting distant objects as paler, less detailed, and usually bluer than near objects.

[[File:Frans Koppelaar - Backlight Langestraat.jpg|thumb|[[Frans Koppelaar]], Backlight Langestraat|left]]
(One caution: in common speech, the words ''perspective'' and ''viewpoint'' tend to be used interchangeably; however, in art, aerial perspective does not imply an [[aerial viewpoint]], such as that forming the basis of the [[aerial landscape]] genre. The example by [[Frans Koppelaar]] pictured here shows the difference. This landscape is a good example of aerial perspective; however, it is not an aerial landscape, since the observer is apparently standing on the ground.)

'''''Allegory''''' is a  painting by the Italian Renaissance master [[Filippino Lippi]], executed around 1498. It is now housed in the [[Uffizi Gallery]] of  [[Florence]]. 

The work had been variously assigned, from [[Leonardo da Vinci]] to an unknown 15th century painter.

==Description==
The scene is set on a hill, with Florence in the background. It features a man, whose legs are tied by a serpent, who closes to an aged one, dressing in red and sitting near a tree. The latter is holding several lightnings. Next to the walking man is a small [[stoat]], a symbol of purity.

The same character,  with the serpent getting out from his jacket and looking at him, has fallen in the foreground. An inscription gets out from his mouth, saying ''NULLA DETERIOR PESTIS QUAM FAMILIARIS INIMICUS'' ("Nothing is more dangerous than a family's enemy") and going towards the old man.

The subject has been variously interpreted: as the story of [[Laocoön]], an allegory of two enemy brothers, or, more likely, of the civil wars that followed the fall of [[Girolamo Savonarola]] in Florence. The last version is supported by the fact that, in Renaissance art, the presence of a well defined city (Florence in this case) had always a meaning. The man dressing in red would be God or Jupiter; in the latter case, the man nearing him would be nearing paganism, the serpent being a symbol of the Devil making him stumble later.

'''Andrew Vicari''' (born Andrea Antonio Giovanni Vaccari, 20 April 1932 – 3 October 2016) was a Welsh painter working in France, who established a career painting portraits of prominent people. Despite being largely unknown in his own country, {{As of|2004|lc=on}} Vicari was Britain's richest living painter,{{cn|date=October 2016}} and at one time Britain 18th richest person.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37540601|title=Andrew Vicari the 'painter of kings' dies, aged 84|date=3 October 2016|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Vicari was born in [[Port Talbot]], Wales, in 1932&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southwales-eveningpost.co.uk/tributes-as-saudi-royal-artist-andrew-vicari-dies-at-home-in-wales/story-29773349-detail/story.html "Tributes as Saudi royal artist Andrew Vicari dies at home in Wales"], ''South Wales Evening Post'', 3 October 2016. Retrieved 6 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; to Italian parents, Vittorio Vaccari ('tobacconist and confectioner'), and his wife, Italini Bertani, from [[Parma]].&lt;ref name="king of painters"&gt;{{cite news|author=Stuart Jeffries |title='I am the king of painters' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/nov/16/arts.highereducation |work=[[The Guardian]] (G2) |date=16 November 2001 |accessdate=24 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/andrew-vicari-now-bankruptcy-proceedings-7989223 |title=Andrew Vicari now in bankruptcy proceedings |first=Robin |last=Turner |date=23 October 2014 |publisher= |accessdate=4 October 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005123530/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/andrew-vicari-now-bankruptcy-proceedings-7989223 |archivedate=5 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He was evacuated to [[Aberdare]] during World War II. He later attended [[Neath Grammar School|Neath Grammar School for Boys]]. Aged 12 he won the Gold Medal for Painting at the [[National Eisteddfod of Wales|Wales National Eisteddfod]].&lt;ref name="king of painters" /&gt; Between 1950 and 1952 he studied painting at the [[Slade School of Fine Art]] at [[University College London]] (UCL) under [[William Coldstream]] and occasionally [[Lucian Freud]] as teachers. He had initially been refused a place at the Slade and was only admitted when someone dropped out.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Career==
After only two years, in 1952, Vicari left the Slade without completing his diploma course and went to Florence.  He stayed there and in Rome for two years before returning 'penniless' to the UK&lt;ref&gt; Mills, John ''Which Yet Survive.  Impressions of Friends, Family and Encounters'', Quartet Books, London 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.  He then began working in London as a portrait painter and in 1961 a large show of his work was put on in the former Debenhams showroom near Leicester Square financed by the band leader and impresario [[Jack Hylton]]. Eschewing modern trends, he remained a figurative artist working in oil. His work is appreciated worldwide, especially in the [[Middle East]] where three museums are solely dedicated to his work.

In 1974, Vicari was appointed as the official painter to the [[King of Saudi Arabia|King]] and [[Government of Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref name="king of painters" /&gt; In the following decades, he painted many portraits of the [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]] as well as scenes of [[Riyadh]] and [[Bedouin]] life. It is largely due to this patronage that Vicari owed his financial success and in 2011 earned him the title "The Rembrandt of Riyadh" from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/30/magazine/30Vicari-t.html|title=The Rembrandt of Riyadh|date=27 January 2011|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he sold a collection of 125 paintings of the [[First Gulf War]] to Prince Khaled for £17 million.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

==Personal life==
Vicari lived and worked at his studio outside [[Nice]], France, although he also owned apartments in Riyadh and Monte Carlo.

In 2006 his fortune was valued at £92 million by the [[Sunday Times Rich List|''Sunday Times'' Rich List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/section/0,,20590,00.html|title=The Times &amp; The Sunday Times|publisher=|accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2014, however, it was reported that Vicari had filed for bankruptcy and had been in poor health.&lt;ref name="WMail bankruptcy"&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner |first=Robin |title=Andrew Vicari now in bankruptcy proceedings |url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/andrew-vicari-now-bankruptcy-proceedings-7989223 |work=[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]] |date=24 October 2014 |page=5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161005123530/http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/andrew-vicari-now-bankruptcy-proceedings-7989223 |archivedate=5 October 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battle for Sevastopol''''' ({{lang-ru|"Битва за Севастополь"}}; {{lang-uk|"Незламна"}} "Indestructible") is a 2015 [[Biographical film|biographical]] [[war film]] about [[Lyudmila Pavlichenko]], a young [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] who joined the [[Red Army]] to fight the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Nazi invasion of the USSR]] and became one of the deadliest [[sniper]]s in [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[King, Gilbert (February 21, 2013). "Eleanor Roosevelt and the Soviet Sniper". Smithsonian. Retrieved 14 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; The film, a joint [[Russia|Russian]]-[[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] production, was released in both countries on April 2, 2015; its international premiere took place two weeks later at the [[Beijing International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4084744/releaseinfo Bitva za Sevastopol (2015) - Release Info]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically speaking, the movie revolves around the events of the [[Siege_of_Odessa_(1941)|siege of Odessa]] and the [[Siege_of_Sevastopol_(1941%E2%80%9342)|siege of Sevastopol]].

The film is directed by Sergey Mokritskiy and stars [[Yulia Peresild]] as Pavlichenko. In addition to Beijing, where Peresild was awarded Best Actress award, the film has also appeared at [[Cannes Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screendaily.com/festivals/cannes-news/battle-for-sevastopol-sold-into-asia/5087942.article 'Battle for Sevastopol' sold into Asia]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot ==
The film opens and closes with post-war scenes from the perspective of [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] ([[Joan Blackham]]) as she visits the protagonist Lyudmila Pavlichenko (Yulia Peresild) during the former first lady's 1957 trip to the Soviet Union. Pavlichenko's story is told through flashbacks to 1942 when Pavlichenko toured the United States with Roosevelt, and further flashbacks to Pavlichenko's experiences in the Soviet Union. After the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of the USSR]], university student Pavlichenko becomes a sniper in the [[25th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|25th Rifle Division]]. She fights in the [[Battle of Odessa (1941)|Battle of Odessa]] and, eventually, the [[Siege of Sevastopol (1941–42)|defense of Sevastopol]]. After 309 confirmed kills, she is sent to the [[United States]] to campaign for American support. Eleanor Roosevelt invites her to the White House, and the two become friends.

In 1941, Lyudmila is a student who has just gotten into university; to celebrate, she goes to a shooting range with her friends including a classmate named Masha, doing exceptionally well despite never have shot before. At home, her father shows no pride in her, having desired a son who could become a soldier. In a twist of events, her perfect shooting results at the range eventually result in the military contacting her for a sharpshooting program, as Germany has just invaded the Soviet Union. Though a doctor courting her, Boris, tells her she should stay with him, she rejects what she perceives as cowardice and leaves to fight on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]].

During training, Lyudmila is shown as an excellent sniper, and eventually is partnered with a grizzled veteran named Makarov, who she falls in love with. He doesn't return her affections, however, and explains that he had lost his wife and family when the Germans invaded. She is also reunited with Masha, who is now a nurse engaged with a young pilot. During battle defending the city of Odessa, she is injured and Makarov drags her to safety to a local hospital, where Boris has volunteered as a military doctor. After awakening, Lyudmila manages to get Boris to sign her papers so that she can return to the frontlines, but finds out that Makarov has died in battle and the Soviets are retreating to Sevastopol.

She is paired with another superior, Leonid, and begins to show signs of trauma, showing signs of cruelty by shooting enemy soldiers to wound them and watch them suffer, rather than kill them instantly. Thus, their relationship starts off rough, but they eventually develop a close romance. Masha invites them to her wedding, but at the wedding reveals that her fiance had died, leaving her alone. This leads Lyudmila to tell Leonid privately that she wants a son.

While on patrol in a field, Leonid steps on a mine that triggers a [[flare]]. Immediately, artillery shells begin to pummel the field, and Leonid shelters her from them with his body. Lyudmila again wakes up in a hospital, where Boris tells her Leonid has died. Though in a broken state, she is ordered to kill a top enemy sniper for propaganda purposes. The duel takes all of a day, and, tired of waiting, Lyudmila steps out of cover, exposing herself completely. She is shot, but manages to pinpoint the enemy sniper's location and kills him.

Boris eventually is able to pull her away from battle. As the city is being evacuated, Boris carries a traumatized Lyudmila to a submarine that is evacuating the city. As panicked civilians attempt to board evacuating ships, Lyudmila realizes that Boris isn't coming with her, as he gave her his ticket. A voiceover by Eleanor Roosevelt reveals that Boris, Masha, and countless civilians and soldiers died defending the city from the Germans.

Roosevelt later visits Lyudmila after the war, where she is now a mother. They attend the opera together, with Lyudmila's son.

== Production ==
The filming began in 2012 after the first archive material devoted to Pavlichenko was examined. Serhiy Mokrytskyi, who is better known as a cinematographer, served as director; after his arrival, the plot was altered to more closely match Pavlichenko's life. During production, there was concern of the growing [[Russia-Ukraine relations|political tension between Russia and Ukraine]].
However, the film was successfully released in both countries on the same day, in each country's own respective language.

==Box office==
The movie grossed [[Ruble|RUB]] 435,468,256 ($8,702,274) in the Russian box office against a budget of RUB 124,000,000 and hence was a commercial success.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/742026/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''British Phaenogamous Botany''''' is figures and descriptions of British flowering plants compiled by the botanist [[William Baxter (Oxford Botanic Garden curator)|William Baxter]].

==Description==
The six volumes were published in [[Oxford]] by J.H. Parker between 1832 and 1843.  

The 509 hand-coloured copper-engraved plates were accompanied by botanical descriptions in 8vo. To illustrate this work on the British flora, Baxter employed two local artists—Isaac Russell (an Oxford glass painter) and C. Matthews. The plates were hand-coloured by Baxter's daughters and daughter-in-law.

The '''caper story''' is a subgenre of [[crime fiction]].  The typical caper story involves one or more crimes (especially thefts, swindles, or occasionally kidnappings) perpetrated by the main characters in full view of the reader. The actions of police or detectives attempting to prevent or solve the crimes may also be chronicled, but are not the main focus of the story.

The caper story is distinguished from the straight crime story by elements of humor, adventure, or unusual cleverness or audacity.  For instance, the [[John Dortmunder|Dortmunder]] stories of [[Donald E. Westlake]] are highly comic tales involving unusual thefts by a gang of offbeat characters &amp;mdash; in different stories Dortmunder's gang steals the same gem several times, steals an entire branch bank, and kidnaps someone from an asylum by driving a stolen train onto the property.  By contrast, the same author's [[Parker (Stark novels character)|Parker]] stories (published under the name Richard Stark) are grimly straightforward accounts of mundane crime &amp;mdash; the criminal equivalent of the [[police procedural]]. Others, such as [[Lawrence Block]]'s [[Bernie Rhodenbarr]] novels, feature a role reversal, an honest criminal and crooked cop, and the use of [[burglar]] Rhodenbarr criminal talents to solve murders.

A caper may appear as a subplot in a larger work.  For example, [[Tom Sawyer]]'s plot to steal Jim out of slavery in the last part of ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (novel)|Huckleberry Finn]]'' is a classic caper.

== Etymology ==
The verb ''to caper'' means to leap in a frolicsome way,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/caper Caper; definition 2] from the [[Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; and probably derives from ''capriole'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/capriole Capriole] from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; which derives from the Latin for [[goat]] (''[[Capra (genus)|Capra]]''). The noun ''caper''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/caper Caper; definition 3] from the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; means a frolicsome leap, a capricious escapade or an illegal or questionable act.

The official '''coat of arms of [[Grenada]]''' is a shield divided into four parts by a golden cross. In the centre of this cross is the [[Santa María (ship)|''Santa Maria'']], [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus']] flagship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.gd/coa.html |title=Coat of Arms |publisher=[[Government of Grenada]] |accessdate=2008-07-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403072754/http://www.gov.gd/coa.html |archivedate=2008-04-03 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A British lion on a red field is shown in the upper left and lower right sections of the shield, with a golden crescent moon out of which a [[Lilium|lily]] growsin the upper right and lower left sections. Above the shield there is a golden helmet, topped with a garland of [[bougainvillea]] branches. Within the garland are seven red [[rose]]s, which stand for the seven communities of Grenada. Holding the shield on the dexter side is an [[armadillo]] which stands before a [[maize|corn]] stalk; on the sinister side is a [[Grenada dove]], which stands before a [[banana]] plant. The base represents [[Mount Saint Catherine (Grenada)|Mount St. Catherine]] with the [[Grand Etang Lake]] at the centre. A ribbon displays the national motto: "Ever conscious of God we aspire, build and advance as one people."

The coat of arms was adopted by the [[island nation]] in 1974 following independence.

'''Collagraphy''' (sometimes spelled '''collography''') was introduced in 1955 by Glen Alps and is a [[printmaking]] process in which materials are applied to a rigid substrate (such as [[paperboard]] or [[wood]]). The word is derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''koll'' or ''kolla'', meaning [[adhesive|glue]], and ''graph'', meaning the activity of [[drawing]].

The plate can be [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]]-inked, inked with a roller or paintbrush or some combination thereof. Ink or pigment is applied to the resulting [[collage]] and the board is used to print onto [[paper]] or another material using either a [[printing press]] or various hand tools. The resulting print is termed a '''collagraph'''. Substances such as [[carborundum]], [[acrylic paint|acrylic texture medium]]s, sandpapers, textiles, bubble wrap, string or other fibres, cut card, leaves and grass can all be used in creating the collagraph plate. In some instances, leaves can be used as a source of pigment by rubbing them onto the surface of the plate.

Different tonal effects and vibrant colours can be achieved with the technique due to the depth of relief and differential inking that results from the collagraph plate's highly textured surface. Collagraphy is a very open printmaking method. Ink may be applied to the upper surfaces of the plate with a [[brayer]] for a [[relief print]], or ink may be applied to the entire board and then removed from the upper surfaces but remain in the spaces between objects, resulting in an [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio]] print. A combination of both intaglio and relief methods may also be employed. A [[printing press]] may or may not be used.

A '''cultural district''' is traditionally conceived as a well-recognized, labeled, [[mixed-use]] area of a [[Human settlement|settlement]] in which a high concentration of cultural facilities serves as the anchor of attraction.

A debate has emerged on the concept of the cultural district, promoting potentially ground-breaking initiatives, even if most of the literature has concentrated on urban clusters, cities of art and cities of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Creative cities, cultural clusters and local economic development|author1=Cooke, P. |author2= Lazzeretti, L. |last-author-amp=yes |publisher = Edward Elgar|year = 2008|isbn = |location = Cheltenham|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Tourism, creativity and development|last = Richards, G., &amp; Wilson, J. (Eds.)|first = |publisher = Routledge|year = 2007|isbn = |location = London|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilities include: [[performance]] spaces, [[museums]], [[art museum|galleries]], artist studios, arts-related retail shops, music or media production studios, dance studios, high schools or colleges for the arts, libraries, [[arboretum]]s and gardens.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
Because they are [[mixed-use development]]s, cultural districts incorporate other facilities such as office complexes, [[retail]] spaces and, occasionally, [[residential area]]s.

The creation of a cultural district implies [[collaboration]] between the arts and the local community. Cultural districts may be seen by local authorities as a way to revitalize the “brownfields” of the urban core: areas of abandoned buildings that encourage businesses and residents to leave the [[citie]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artsusa.org/information_services/research/impact_areas/arts_environments/001.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201051356/http://www.artsusa.org//information_services/research/impact_areas/arts_environments/001.asp |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }} Cultural Districts, Americans for the Arts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cultural Districts, ‘The Arts as a Strategy for Revitalizing our Cities’, Americans for the Arts, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

The developing theory of cultural districts increasingly conceives them as development models for local systems, where the term ‘district’ refers to supra-urban area.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Learning to design cultural districts and learning from designing them|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09654313.2015.1133565|journal = European Planning Studies|date = 2016-01-19|issn = 0965-4313|pages = 1–19|volume = 0|issue = 0|doi = 10.1080/09654313.2015.1133565|first = Alberto|last = Francesconi|first2 = Claudia|last2 = Dossena}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sacco, P.

Such a linear top-down approach to analysis and design, however, exhibits many limitations when used for organizational settings characterized by a complex web of interdependencies.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The view of a cultural district as a complex adaptive system suggests new ideas and approaches for policy-makers, designers and managers. It also opens up debate on issues of organizational design and change.

==United States activities==
More than 90 cities in the [[United States]] have planned or implemented cultural districts, positioning the arts at the center of their urban revitalization efforts.{{fact|date=January 2017}}
All cultural districts are unique, reflecting their cities’ unique environment, including history of land use, urban growth and cultural development. There is no standard model.
Most cultural districts are built to take advantage of other city attractions such as historic features, [[Convention (meeting)|convention]] spaces and parks and other natural [[amenities]].

Structural considerations within or near the district, [[community]] leadership and social forces all influence the development of a cultural district and the type of [[district]] that results. Factors influencing the siting of cultural districts include: perceived need for urban revitalization, existing investment, property value and preexisting cultural facilities.

Unlike a cultural center or a [[shopping mall]], a cultural district comprises a large number of property owners, both public and private, who control the various properties involved, hence a structural [[complexity]]. The [[effectiveness]] of the coordinating agency in guiding the direction of the cultural district varies according to its size, budget, mandated functions and degree of authority, resulting in widespread variation in the coordinated cultural programming and administration services offered by cultural districts. The coordinated [[Government agency|agency]] appointed for the district must work carefully to ensure inclusiveness of concerns and to balance potentially conflicting interests.

Cultural districts offer two major types of [[tertiary sector of the economy|service]]s: one targets the arts community, providing [[marketing]] /promotion, [[box office]] services and property management; the other targets the district’s business and property owners, offering urban [[design]] and development services or administrative support.

The excitement and attraction of a cultural district is a high mixture of interesting things to do, places to see, and places to visit (both cultural and noncultural), across the day and evening.

Some artist-activists are promoting the concept of a "Naturally Occurring Cultural District," or NOCD, patterned after the demographic concept of a [[naturally occurring retirement community]]. A NOCD "supports existing neighborhood cultural assets rather than imposing arts institutions somewhere new," according to Tamara Greenfield, co-director of NOCD-New York. Co-director Caron Atlas explained: "If a cultural district has emerged 'naturally,' then it grows from, builds on and validates existing community assets rather than importing assets from outside a community."&lt;ref&gt;Urban Omnibus, [http://urbanomnibus.net/2010/11/naturally-occurring-cultural-districts/ Naturally Occurring Cultural Districts], Nov. 17, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, different conceptions of cultural districts include self-organization and emergence in different degrees (e.g. Lazzeretti, 2003; Le Blanc, 2010; Sacco et al., 2013; Stern &amp; Seifert, 2007). Many authors argue that districtualization is essentially spontaneous and that the conditions for formation can be recognized and sustained, not created from the top.&lt;ref name="Lazzeretti 635–648"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = City of art as a High Culture local system and cultural districtualization processes: the cluster of art restoration in Florence|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-2427.00470/abstract|journal = International Journal of Urban and Regional Research|date = 2003-09-01|issn = 1468-2427|pages = 635–648|volume = 27|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/1468-2427.00470|first = Luciana|last = Lazzeretti}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, M.

&lt;/ref&gt; If the conception of a cultual district as a complex adaptive system were accepted, the design process would be conceived as something more flexible, dynamic and in evolution. Complexity theory and complex adaptive systems should move understanding of supra-urban cultural districts towards a more holistic and bottom-up approach&lt;ref name="Lazzeretti 635–648"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cultural Districts, A New Strategy for Regional Development?

This does not suggest inhibiting any attempt at prediction or planning. The use of qualitative analysis and rough estimations or agent-based modelling can represent a fertile ground for both future research, policy-making and managerial implications.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

'''''Days of '36''''' ({{lang-el|Μέρες του '36|italic=yes|translit=Méres tou '36}}) is a 1972 [[cinema of Greece|Greek]] dramatic [[independent film|independent]] [[underground film|underground]] [[art film]] directed by [[Theo Angelopoulos]]. Its title is a tribute to [[Constantine P. Cavafy]].

Filmed during the [[Greek military junta of 1967–74|Regime of the Colonels]], the film draws parallels between the regime and the dictatorship of [[Ioannis Metaxas]], but it does so implicitly, in order to escape censorship. Angelopoulos elsewhere speaks of an "aesthetic of the unspoken." He points out that the most important things always happen out of the field of view, behind closed doors or on the phone. When something is said, it is only whispered.

==Synopsis==
In May 1936, in a [[Greece]] riven by political strife, a trade union leader is assassinated. Sofianos, a petty criminal and smuggler as well as a police informant and leftist agitator, is accused of the murder. Kept incommunicado in a room separate from the other detainees, his only two visitors are a member of parliament from the Conservative Party and his driver, who is also his brother. One day, Sofianos takes the member of parliament as a hostage inside his cell to obtain his release before midnight; it is not clear how he has obtained the revolver which he was using. The prison guards are powerless, while the warden is under pressure from his political bosses to find a quick resolution to the standoff.

Sofianos's lawyer tries to reason with him, explaining to his client that the weapon in his possession is a trap that has been se tup for him, and that by taking the deputy as a hostage he is playing the game of those who accuse him. The lawyer conducts an investigation to exonerate Sofianos but ends up being beaten up in a deserted street.

In the meantime, an escape attempt takes place in the prison, but three escapees are caught up in the countryside.

Under pressure from representatives of the major powers, the political and prison authorities are trying to put an end to the hostage-taking by various means, including the poisoning of the prisoner. Eventually, at nightfall, a sniper shoots Sofianos in his cell.

The next morning, the three escapees are shot and the body of Sofianos is added to the funeral truck.

The '''''Eastman Monument''''' is a [[public artwork]] by an unknown artist, located at [[Crown Hill National Cemetery]], which is in [[Indianapolis]], [[Indiana]], [[United States of America]]. It is a monument with a white [[marble]] [[angel]] standing against a [[granite]] cross that is standing upon three steps. The angel is dressed in a cloth gown and stands with its hands spread out and its head turned down to the ground. The first step has "EASTMAN" written across it.&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Save Outdoor Sculpture, Indiana Survey | year=2000 | title=Eastman Monument (sculpture)  | work= SIRIS | publisher=Smithsonian Institution | url=http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?&amp;profile=all&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;uri=full=3100001~!345039~!0#focus | accessdate= 26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information==

This monument was installed by the Eastman family in the early 20th century. Members of the Eastman family are buried in front of the monument. The family operated a medical clinic called the Eastman Clinic in the early 20th century, which is displayed on the headstones of the family members who worked in the medical field.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

{{Missing information|English as a discipline in high school and earlier|date=January 2018}}

'''English studies''' (usually called simply '''English''') is an academic discipline taught in [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], and post-secondary education in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]]; it is not to be confused with [[English as a second or foreign language|English taught as a foreign language]], which is a distinct discipline. English includes: the study of [[English literature|literature]] written in the [[English language]] (especially [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], and [[poetry]]), the majority of which comes from Britain, the United States, and Ireland (although English-language literature from any country may be studied, and local or national literature is usually emphasized in any given country); English [[composition (language)|composition]], including writing [[essay]]s, short stories, and poetry; English [[language arts]], including the study of [[grammar]], [[linguistic prescription|usage]], and [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]]; and English [[sociolinguistics]], including [[discourse analysis]] of written and spoken texts in the English language, the [[history of the English language]], [[English language learning and teaching]], and the study of [[World English]]es. English [[linguistics]] ([[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], etc.) is usually treated as a distinct discipline, taught in a department of linguistics.

The disciplinary divide between a dominant literature or usage orientation is one motivation for the division of the North American [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) into two subgroups. At universities in non-English-speaking countries, the same department often covers all aspects of English studies, including linguistics: this is reflected, for example, in the structure and activities of the [[European Society for the Study of English]] (ESSE).

It is common for departments of English to offer courses and scholarship in the areas of the English language, literature (including [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]]), [[public speaking]] and [[speechwriter|speech-writing]], [[rhetoric]], [[composition studies]], [[creative writing]], [[philology]] and [[etymology]], [[journalism]], poetry, [[publishing]], [[literacy]], [[area studies]] (especially [[American studies]]), the [[philosophy of language]], [[theater]] and [[playwright|play-writing]], [[screenwriting]], [[communication studies]], [[technical communication]], [[cultural studies]], [[critical theory]], [[gender studies]], [[ethnic studies]], [[disability studies]], [[digital media]] and [[electronic publishing]], [[film studies]] and other [[media studies]], and various courses in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]], among others. In most English-speaking countries, the study at all educational levels of texts produced in non-English languages takes place in other departments, such as departments of foreign language or of [[comparative literature]].

==English major==
The '''English Major''' (alternatively "English concentration," "B.A. in English") is a term in the United States and a few other countries for an [[undergraduate]] [[university]] degree focused around the consumption, analysis, and production of texts in the [[English language]]. The term may also be used to describe a student who is pursuing such a degree.

Students who major in English reflect upon, analyse, and interpret [[literature]] and [[film]], presenting their analyses in clear, cogent [[writing]]. Although help-wanted postings rarely solicit English majors specifically, a degree in English hones [[critical thinking]] skills essential to a number of career fields, including [[writing]], [[editing]], [[publishing]], [[teaching]], [[research]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[law]], and [[finance]].

===History===
The history of English studies at the modern university in Europe and America begins in the second half of the nineteenth century. Initially, English studies comprised a motley array of content: the practice of oratory, the study of rhetoric and grammar, the composition of poetry, and the appreciation of literature (mostly by authors from England, since American literature and language study was only added in the twentieth century).&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of these developments, see Gerald Graff, ''Professing Literature. An Institutional History'' (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany and several other European countries, English [[philology]], a strongly positivistic and historically interested practice of reading pre-modern texts, became the preferred scholarly paradigm, but English-speaking countries distanced themselves from philological paradigms soon after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict," in: ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34-44.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this process, English departments tended to refocus their work on various forms of writing instruction (creative, professional, critical) and the interpreting of literary texts, and teacher education in English recovered from the neglect it had suffered because of more science-oriented paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McComiskey, ed., ''English Studies. An Introduction to the Discipline'' (Urbana, IL: NCTE, 2006), esp. pp. 44-48, "The New English Studies."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, English departments in native-speaking countries re-evaluate their roles as sole guardians of the discipline because English is less and less native speakers' unique 'property' and has to be shared with the millions of speakers and writers from other countries for whom English is an essential means of communication and artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [http://www.english.tamu.edu/english-without-borders?destination=node%2F76 English Without Borders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204032833/http://www.english.tamu.edu/english-without-borders?destination=node%2F76 |date=2014-02-04 }} project at Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/ref&gt;

English literature became an object of study in French universities as part of foreign (comparative) literature in the nineteenth century. A chair of foreign literature was established at the College de France in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vorachek|first=Laura|date=2017|title=Journalism and the Periodical Press in Nineteenth-Century Britain ed. by Joanne Shattock (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/682977|journal=Victorian Periodicals Review|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=829–833|doi=10.1353/vpr.2017.0059|issn=1712-526X}}&lt;/ref&gt; English was first taught independently from other languages and literature in the University of Lille and in the University of Lyons and only afterwards in the Sorbonne. These three universities were the first major centres of English studies in France. The first lecturer and later professor of English studies would seem to have been Auguste Angellier. After spending several years teaching French in England in the 1860s and 1870s, he became a lecturer in English studies in the University of Lille in 1881 and a professor of English in 1893. In France nowadays, literature, civilisation, linguistics and the spoken and written language are all important in English studies in universities.&lt;ref&gt;Imelda Bonel-Elliott (2000), “English Studies in France” in: Engler, Balz and Haas, Renate, ''European English Studies: Contributions Towards a History of the Discipline''. Leicester: The English Association for ESSE, pp. 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English major rose to prominence in [[United States|American]] colleges during the first half of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf|title=120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait|last=National Center for Education Statistics|first=|date=January 1993|website=National Center for Education Statistics|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided an opportunity for students to develop skills in analytical reading with the aim of improving their writing, as well as exercises in rhetoric and persuasive expression that had been traditionally only taught in [[classical studies]] and available to the very few due to language barriers and a shortage of professors who could actively engage students in the humanities. Outside the United States (originating in [[Scotland]] and then rippling out into the English-speaking world) the English major became popular in the latter half of the 19th century during a time when religious beliefs were shaken in the face of scientific discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ian/arnold.htm "Literature and Science" (Matthew Arnold [1882&amp;#93;)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Literature]] was thought to act as a replacement for [[religion]] in the retention and advancement of culture, and the English Major thus provided students with the chance to draw [[moral]], [[ethical]], and [[philosophical]] qualities and meanings of older studies from a richer and broader source of literature than that of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Latin]] classics.

Since 2000, there have been more and more questions about the specific function of English departments at the contemporary U.S. college and university.{{By whom|date=February 2018}} The absence of a clearly defined disciplinary identity and the increasingly utilitarian goals in U.S. society present a challenge to those academic units still mostly focusing on the printed book and the traditional division in historical periods and national literatures, and neglecting allegedly non-theoretical areas such as professional writing, composition, and multimodal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "The Trouble with English," ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 13 January 2013 (http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/01/03/the-trouble-with-english/); and "Quo vadis, English Studies," ''Philologie im Netz'' 69 (2014): 93-100 (http://web.fu-berlin.de/phin/phin69/p69t8.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skills acquired ===

In the past an [[academic degree]] in English usually meant an intensive study of [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] literary masterpieces. Now, however, an English Major encompasses a much broader range of topics which stretch over multiple disciplines. While the requirements for an English Major vary from university to university, most English departments emphasize three core skills: analyzing literature, a process which requires [[logic]] and reflective analysis; creativity and imagination with regards to the production of good writing; and an understanding of different [[cultures]], [[civilizations]], and literary styles from various time periods. The skills gained from studying English include acquiring tools that will never lose value, understanding the ever-changing media, to explain your own world, and more.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Major in English?|url=http://english.yale.edu/undergraduate/why-major-english|website=Yale University|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective English Majors can expect to take college courses in [[academic writing]], [[creative writing]], [[literary theory]], [[British literature|British]] and [[United States|American]] literature, multicultural literature, several literary genres (such as [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[film studies]]), and a number of elective multidisciplinary topics such as [[history]], courses in the [[social sciences]], and studies in a foreign language. To the end of studying these disciplines, candidates for a Major in English attain skills in professional writing with relations to [[rhetoric]], [[literary analysis]], an appreciation for the diversity of cultures, and an ability to clearly and persuasively express their ideas in writing.

=== Examples of courses ===

Most English courses fall into the broader categories of either Literature-based studies, which focus on classical authors and time periods, or Rhetorical studies, which concentrate on communication skills in preparation for specialization in a variety of professional fields. While specific graduation requirements vary from university to university, students can expect to study some of the following courses.

'''Courses in [[Writing]] and [[Composition (language)|Composition]]''': such as Academic and Professional Writing, which stress analytical writing and train students to produce clear, cohesive arguments.

'''Courses in [[British Literature]]''': Courses may focus on time periods, authors, genres, or literary movements. Examples include [[Shakespeare]]'s Tragedies, History and Theory of British Drama, Medieval English Literature, and the Victorian Novel.

'''Courses in [[American Literature]]''': Depending upon the university, these courses can either be broken down by time period, such as Nineteenth Century [[Gothic Fiction]]; authors, such as classes on [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]], [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], or [[Robert Frost|Frost]]; or Literary schools and movements, such as [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] or [[Transcendentalism]].

'''Courses in Multicultural Literature''': The value of bringing a range of cultural and multidisciplinary perspectives to the study of [[English literature]] is being increasingly recognized in a number of universities. Examples include Multi-cultural Literatures in Medieval England, Latina Narratives, and Studies in Jewish Literature.

'''Rhetorical courses''': Focus on techniques of persuasive arguing in the written form, as well as skills which involve the analysis of written texts.

=== Career opportunities ===

A major in English opens a variety of career opportunities for college graduates entering the job market. Since students who graduate with an English degree are trained to ask probing questions about large bodies of texts and then to formulate, analyze, and answer those questions in coherent, persuasive [[prose]]—skills vital to any number of careers—English majors have much to choose from after graduation. The most obvious career choices for English majors are writing, publishing, journalism, and teaching. However, other less intuitive job options include positions in [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[acting]], [[law]], [[business]], [[marketing]], [[information assurance]], and directing.

==History==
Early planning work for Exhibit Columbus began in late 2014, and the project was officially launched on 5 May 2016 in Columbus as a program of Heritage Fund—The Community Foundation of Bartholomew County. It receives funding from a number of local and regional individuals, foundations, and corporations.

===100 Variations===
An exhibition was created in the fall of 2014 as a pilot project that featured designer [[Jonathan Nesci]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Khemsurov|first1=Monica|title=Jonathan Nesci in Conversation With Matt Olson of RO/LU - Sight Unseen|url=http://www.sightunseen.com/2014/10/jonathan-nesci-in-conversation-with-matt-olson-of-rolu/|accessdate=21 October 2016|work=Sight Unseen|date=14 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; who created 100 unique tables for an installation in front of [[First Christian Church (Columbus, Indiana)|First Christian Church]].  This exhibition, "100 Variations," was produced by Indianapolis-based curator, Christopher West with support from the Haddad Foundation, the Columbus Area Visitors Center, and the Columbus Museum of Art and Design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chocolate, Baroque &amp; Design - October 2, 2014|url=http://www.wfyi.org/programs/the-art-of-the-matter/radio/chocolate-baroque-and-design-october-2-2014|accessdate=30 July 2016|work=WFYI Public Media|issue=2 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of the tables was made by Noblitt Fabricating&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=Jonathan Nesci Making his Mark in Columbus|url=http://www.patternindy.com/2014/10/07/jonathan-nesci-making-his-mark-in-columbus/|website=Pattern|accessdate=20 October 2016|date=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Columbus, Indiana under the leadership of Curt Aton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McCoy|first1=Richard|title=Curt Aton|journal=Pattern|date=Fall 2015|issue=8|page=62|url=http://www.patternindy.com/previous-issues/|accessdate=20 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphic identity===
The Chicago-based graphic design firm, Thirst, was hired in 2016 to create the Exhibit Columbus identity with the goal of creating a system that was aligned with [[Paul Rand]]'s designs in Columbus, along with [[Alexander Girard]]'s work at the [[Miller House and Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibit Columbus - Work - Thirst|url=http://3st.com/work/exhibit-columbus#1|website=Thirst|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This identity was immediately recognized with an award from the Society of Typographic Artists, and has gone on to considerable critical acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Exhibit Columbus - STA100|url=http://100.sta-chicago.org/portfolio-item/exhibit-columbus/|website=STA100|accessdate=25 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity was primarily created by [[Rick Valicenti]], a 2006 [[List of AIGA medalists|AIGA medalist]] and a 2009 [[National Design Awards|National Design Award]] winner.

===The J. Irwin and Xenia S. Miller Prize===
The Miller Prize was created to honor [[J. Irwin Miller]] and his wife Xenia S. Miller, two of the twentieth century’s greatest patrons of architecture, design, and art, and a "family whose visionary commitment to community remains unparalleled." The Miller Prize is the center piece of Exhibit Columbus. In 2016 ten designers were paired at one of the five sites in a competition to see which team would be selected by a jury for the opportunity to build an installation in conversation with the past while exploring the future of design and fabrication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exhibit Columbus to feature new J.

===Events===
After hosting its inaugural symposium, "Foundations and Futures," in fall 2016 and inaugural exhibition in the fall of 2017, the 2018 symposium, "Design, Community, and Progressive Preservation" took place in September 2018 and the second exhibition will open in August 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exhibit Columbus Announces National Symposium Details|url=https://indianapublicmedia.org/news/exhibit-columbus-announces-national-symposium-details-142494/|accessdate=2 March 2018|work=News - Indiana Public Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:GaleriadelaRaza.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Galería de la Raza, January 1, 2007]]'''Galería de la Raza''' ('''GDLR''') is a [[non-profit]] [[art gallery]] and [[artist collective]] that serves the heavily [[Latino]] population of [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]'s [[Mission District, San Francisco, California|Mission District]]. GDLR mounts exhibitions, hosts [[poetry reading]]s, workshops, and celebrations, sells works of art, and sponsors youth and [[artist-in-residence]] programs. Exhibitions mounted at the Galería tend to feature the work of [[ethnic minority|minority]] and [[developing country]] artists and concern issues of ethnic history, identity, and social justice.

==History==
The Galería was founded by [[Chicano Movement]] artists [[Ralph Maradiaga]], Rupert García, Peter Rodriguez, Francisco X. Camplis, Gustavo Ramos Rivera, [[Carlos Loarca]], Manuel Villamor, Robert Gonzalez, [[Luis Cervantes]], Chuy Campusano, Rolando Castellón, and [[René Yañez]] in 1970 as a place for [[Mexican American]] and other Latino artists to show their work. It developed into a [[community art]]s center that painted many murals, sponsored youth programs, and gained national and international recognition for its commitment to serving underrepresented communities.

&lt;!-- removed copyvio content --&gt;

In the mid-nineties the ReGeneration Project was started to facilitate the involvement of the next generation of artists. ReGeneration provides emerging artists with exhibition and professional development opportunities as well as opportunity to help plan and manage of Galería activities. One of the most visible contributions of the ReGeneration Project is the updating of the temporary murals on the Bryant Street billboard. Through the new Digital Mural Project computer-generated images are created and displayed in lieu of the traditional painted murals.

==Programs and exhibitions==
Throughout its history, GDLR has given workshops in [[filmmaking]], [[animation]], [[mural]]ism, [[digital art]], and sponsored [[artists-in-residence]]. Important exhibitions have included "Cartelones del Cine Mexicano", which exposed [[Chicano art]]ists to the styles and techniques of Mexican commercial lithographers, "The Peter Rodriguez Collection of Santos from the Mexican Museum", an exhibition of early [[New Mexico|New Mexican]] [[santo (art)|santo]]s, and  "Low 'n Slow", a [[lowrider]]-themed exhibit.

GDLR was also instrumental in reviving the [[indigenous Mexican]] tradition of [[Day of the Dead]] in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and in popularizing the work of the Mexican artists [[Frida Kahlo]] and [[José Guadalupe Posada]] among movement activists.

The '''Hegman Lake Pictographs''' are a well-preserved example of a Native American [[pictograph]], located on North Hegman Lake in the [[Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness]] in [[Minnesota]], USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ely, MN Snowshoeing Trails|url=http://www.ely.org/winter/snowshoeing|website=ely.org|accessdate=23 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rock art is considered "Perhaps the most visited and photogenic pictograph within the State of Minnesota."  The rock wall overlooking the lake has a panel of images as described below.

From "Interpreting the Pictographs of North Hegman Lake", Kevin L. Callahan:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The panel shows a human figure in an outstretched arms posture standing near a quadruped animal with a long tail, possibly a dog or wolf, and a remarkably well drawn bull moose with splayed hooves and dew claws. (A dew claw on a moose is a reduced hind toe or the false rudimentary hoof above the true hoof .) Beneath these figures is a long horizontal line, probably representing the ground or horizon, and above the human figure are two vertical rows of short horizontal lines or dashes. One set has 4 lines and next to it are 3 lines. Above and to the right are what look like three canoes. The top two canoes have two paddlers and the third has a faint single one in the middle. Above the moose's rack is a single mark. Above all of these figures is a large cross like a "plus" sign.

'''''Hospital at Arles''''' is the subject of two paintings that [[Vincent van Gogh]] made of the hospital in which he stayed in December 1888 and again in January 1889. The hospital is located in [[Arles]] in [[southern France]]. One of the paintings is of the central garden between four buildings titled ''Garden of the Hospital in Arles'' (also known as the ''Courtyard of the Hospital at Arles''); the other painting is of a ward within the hospital titled ''Ward of the Hospital in Arles''. Van Gogh also painted a ''Portrait of Dr. Félix Rey'' his physician while in the hospital.

==Arles==

[[Arles]] is located in a region called [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]], department of [[Bouches-du-Rhône]] in [[southern France]].  It is about {{convert|32|km}} southeast of Nîmes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-guide.com/arles_guide/where_is_arles_in_france |title=Where is Arles? |year=2011 |work=Arles Guide |publisher=Arles-guide.com |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===

Arles became a successful port for trade in France during the Roman period.  Many immigrants from [[North Africa]] came to Arles in the 17th and 18th centuries; their influence is reflected in many of the houses of the town that were built during that period.&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-guide.com/arles_guide/arles_history |title=Arles History |year=2011 |work=Arles Guide |publisher=Arles-guide.com |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arles remained economically important for many years as a major port on the Rhône. The arrival of the railway in the 19th century eventually took away of much of the river trade, reducing the city's commercial business.  Because Arles maintained Provençal charm it attracted artists, like Van Gogh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.provence-hideaway.com/205.html |title=Arles |year=2011 |work=Provence Hideaways |publisher=Travel Writers Coop |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Gogh===

[[File:Vincent van Gogh - The yellow house ('The street').jpg|thumb|''[[Yellow House (painting)|The Yellow House]]'' (1888) [[Van Gogh Museum]], Amsterdam (F464)]]
Van Gogh came to Arles on February 20, 1888 and initially stayed at the lodgings at Restaurant Carrel. Signs of spring were evident in the budding almond trees and of winter by the snow-covered landscape. To Van Gogh the scene seemed like a [[Japanese art|Japanese]] landscape.&lt;ref name=Leeuw353&gt;Van Gogh; Leeuw, 353&lt;/ref&gt;

Arles was quite a different place than anywhere else he had lived.  The climate was sunny, hot and dry and the local inhabitants had more of an appearance and sound of people from Spain. The "vivid colors and strong compositional outlines" of Provence led van Gogh to call the area "the Japan of the South."&lt;ref name=NGAsun&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effects of the Sun in Provence |journal=National Gallery of Art Picturing France (1830-1900) |page=121 (starting 1 of pdf) |publisher=National Gallery of Art |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512000557/http://www.nga.gov/education/classroom/france/picfrance_7.pdf |archivedate=2011-05-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this time he produced more than 200 paintings including ''The Starry Night'' [''[[Starry Night over the Rhone]]''], ''[[The Night Café|Café de Nuit]]'' and ''[[Sunflowers (series of paintings)|The Sunflowers]]''.&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory/&gt;

Van Gogh had few friends in Arles, although through acquaintance with Joseph Roulin, a postman, and Ginoux, the owner of Cafe de la Gare where he next roomed, he made many portraits of the [[The Roulin Family (Van Gogh series)|Roulin family]] and of [[L'Arlésienne (painting)|Madame Ginoux]]. Part of his difficulty in making friends was his inability to master the [[Provençal dialect]], "whole days go by without my speaking a single word to anyone, except to order my meals or coffee." In the beginning of his time in Arles, though, he was so enthused by the setting in  Provence that the lack of connection with others hadn't troubled him.  In October 1888 [[Paul Gauguin]] came to Arles and joined van Gogh in his rented rooms at ''[[Yellow House (painting)|The Yellow House]]''.&lt;ref name=Leeuw385&gt;Van Gogh; Leeuw, 385&lt;/ref&gt; 
Unfortunately many of the places that van Gogh had visited and painted were destroyed during bombing raids in [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=ArlesHistory/&gt;

===Events leading up to stay at Arles hospital===

Van Gogh's mental health deteriorated and he became alarmingly eccentric, culminating in an altercation with [[Paul Gauguin]] in December 1888 following which van Gogh cut off part of his own left ear.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 192&lt;/ref&gt; He was then hospitalized in Arles twice over a few months. His condition was diagnosed by the hospital as "acute mania with generalised delirium".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Concordance, lists, bibliography: Documentation|url=http://vangoghletters.org/vg/documentation.html#id8May1889|work=Vincent van Gogh: The Letters|publisher=''[[Van Gogh Museum]]''|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portraits by Vincent van Gogh#Doctor Rey|Dr. Félix Rey]], a young intern at the hospital, also suggested there might be "a kind of epilepsy" involved that he characterised as ''mental'' epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Naifeh and Smith (2011), 701 ''ff.'', 729, 749&lt;/ref&gt; Although some, such as [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger|Johanna van Gogh]], [[Paul Signac]] and posthumous speculation by doctors Doiteau &amp; Leroy have said that van Gogh just removed part of his earlobe and maybe a little more,&lt;ref&gt;Erickson, 106&lt;/ref&gt; art historian Rita Wildegans maintains that without exception, all of the witnesses from Arles said that he removed the entire left ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wildegans.de/vangogh/english/index.html | title=Van Gogh's Ear | author=Wildegans, Dr. R | publisher=Dr. Rita Wildegans | accessdate=2011-04-27 | postscript="''It can be said that with the exception of the sister-in-law [[Johanna van Gogh-Bonger]], who had family-related reasons for playing down the injury, not a single witness speaks of a severed earlobe. On the contrary, the mutually independent statements by the principal witness Paul Gauguin, the prostitute who was given the ear, the gendarme who was on duty in the red-light district, the investigating police officer and the local newspaper report, accord with the evidence that the artist's unfortunate "self-mutilation" involves the entire (left) ear. The existing handwritten and clearly worded medical reports by three different physicians, all of whom observed and treated Vincent van Gogh over an extended period of time in Arles as well as in the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul asylum in Saint-Rémy]] ought to provide ultimate proof of the fact that the artist was missing an entire ear and not just an earlobe.''"}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1889, he returned to the Yellow House where he was living, but spent the following month between hospital and home suffering from hallucinations and delusions that he was being poisoned. In March 1889, the police closed his house after a petition by 30 townspeople, who called him "fou roux" (''the redheaded madman''). Signac visited him in hospital and van Gogh was allowed home in his company. In April 1889, he moved into rooms owned by Dr. Félix Rey, after floods damaged paintings in his own home.&lt;ref&gt;Pickvance (1986). ''Chronology'', 239–242&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tralbaut (1981), 265–273&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, he wrote, "Sometimes moods of indescribable anguish, sometimes moments when the veil of time and fatality of circumstances seemed to be torn apart for an instant." Finally in May 1889 he left Arles for the [[Saint-Paul Asylum, Saint-Rémy (Van Gogh series)|Saint-Paul asylum]] in [[Saint-Rémy-de-Provence]],&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, 145&lt;/ref&gt; having understood his own mental fragility and with a desire to leave Arles.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, 86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arles Hospital===
The courtyard of the former Arles hospital, now named "Espace Van Gogh," is a center for van Gogh's works, several of which are masterpieces.&lt;ref name=Fodor&gt;Fisher, 563&lt;/ref&gt; The garden, framed on all four sides by buildings of the complex, is approached through arcades on the first floor.  A circulation gallery is located on the first and second floors.&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

The Old Hospital of Arles, also known as Hôtel-Dieu-Saint-Espirit, was built in the 16th and 17th centuries. Its main entrance was on Rue Dulau in [[Arles]].  In the early 16th century there were thirty-two charitable institutions serving the city.  The archbishop of Arles decided to consolidate the institutions into one organization at the center of Arles.  Construction was conducted over two centuries.  During excavations remains were unearthed from a [[protohistory]] period  [a period between [[prehistory]] and written [[history]] ] revealing an unknown part of the ancient urban framework, as well as a [[necropolis]] from the [[Roman architecture|Roman]] [[esplanade]].&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

In 1835 three wings were built to accommodate a severe [[cholera]] [[epidemic]].  In the beginning of the 20th century the hospital was modified to bring it up to medical standards of the day.  In 1974 the Joseph-Imbert Hospital was opened and many functions of the Old Hospital of Arles transferred to the new hospital.  By 1986 all medical departments had vacated the buildings and the hospital became part of a restoration project to create a cultural and university center.  The center includes "a media library, the public records, the International College of the Literary Translation (C.I.T.L.), the university radio, a vast showroom, as well as a few shops." Architects Denis Froidevaux and Jean-Louis Tétrel, chosen for the project, preserved historic features, such as the Roman [[esplanade]].&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arles-tourisme.com/en_GB/Ville_visite.aspx?Code=79736750-9df2-47a6-b634-62518b8773b5&amp;Page=1&amp;Ville=Arles |title=Espace Van Gogh |work=Visiter, Places of Interest |publisher=Arles Office de Tourisme |accessdate=2011-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323102647/http://www.arles-tourisme.com/en_GB/Ville_visite.aspx?Code=79736750-9df2-47a6-b634-62518b8773b5&amp;Page=1&amp;Ville=Arles |archivedate=2012-03-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding by benefactors meant the hospital serviced all patient's needs, including abandoned children and orphans.  Starting in 1664 nuns of the [[Augustinians|Order of Saint Augustin]] cared for the patients.&lt;ref name=ArlesTourism/&gt;

==Paintings==
The ''Ward of Arles Hospital'' portrays the institution and the ''Garden of the Hospital in Arles'' the scene outside his hospital room window&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt; or off of a balcony.&lt;ref name=Fell28&gt;Fell, 28&lt;/ref&gt; Van Gogh was also occasionally able to leave the hospital complex and paint the fields.&lt;ref name=HSW/&gt;

===''Garden of the Hospital in Arles''===
Van Gogh made a drawing of the courtyard of the hospital in June 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/595.htm |title=Letter from Vincent van Gogh to Theo van Gogh, Saint-Rémy, 17 or 18 June 1889  |editor=Harrison, R |year=2011 |work=Van Gogh Letters |publisher=WebExhibits| accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vantage point for the painting was his room within the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobharris.com/2008/10/ |title=A visit to Van Gogh’s Arles |author=Harris, B |year=2008 |publisher=bob.harris.com |accessdate=2011-04-30 | postscript=" See photo that shows the vantage point that matches exactly to the painting." }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Van Gogh's description and his painting of the garden allow for identification of its flowers, such as: blue bearded irises, forget-me-nots, oleander, pansies, primroses,  and poppies.  The original design of the courtyard as described by Van Gogh has been preserved.  Radiating segments are surrounded by a "plante bande" now filled with irises.  A difference between the painting and the garden is that van Gogh increased the size of the central fish garden for better composition.&lt;ref name=Fell30&gt;Fell, 30&lt;/ref&gt; Adept at using color to convey mood, the shades of blue and gold in the painting seem to suggest melancholy. The yellow, orange, red and green in the painting are not vivid shades seen in other work from Arles, such as ''Bedroom in Arles.''&lt;ref&gt;Acton, 109-110&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ward in the Hospital in Arles''===
In October 1889 van Gogh resumed painting of a fever ward titled ''Ward in the Hospital in Arles''.  The large study had been unattended for a while and van Gogh's interest was sparked when he read an article regarding [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]'s book ''[[The House of the Dead (novel)|''Souvenirs de la maison des morts'' ("Memories of the House of the Dead")]].&lt;ref name=LW15&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webexhibits.org/vangogh/letter/20/W15.htm  |title=Vincent van Gogh.

Vincent described the painting to his sister [[Wil van Gogh|Wil]], "In the foreground a big black stove around which some grey and black forms of patients and then behind the very long ward paved in red with the two rows of white beds, the partitions white, but a lilac- or green-white, and the windows with pink curtains, with green curtains, and in the background two figures of nuns in black and white. The ceiling is violet with large beams."&lt;ref name=LW15/&gt;

Debra Mancoff, author of ''Van Gogh's Flowers,''&lt;ref&gt;Mancoff&lt;/ref&gt; comments, "In his painting, Ward of Arles Hospital, the exaggerated length of the corridor and the nervous contours that delineate the figures of the patients express the emotional weight of his isolation and confinement."&lt;ref name=HSW&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.howstuffworks.com/arts/artwork/vincent-van-gogh-paintings-from-saint-remy5.htm |title=Ward of Arles Hospital by Vincent van Gogh |author=Mancoff, D |year=2006–2011 |work=HowStuffWorks |publisher=Publications International, Ltd. |accessdate=2011-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Portrait of Dr. Félix Rey''==
Van Gogh made a portrait of the physician who had treated his ear, Dr. Félix Rey, whom he had described in letters to his brother, [[Theo van Gogh (art dealer)|Theo]], as “brave, hardworking, and always helping people.” By January 17, 1889 Van Gogh had given the portrait to Rey as a keepsake.&lt;ref&gt;Van Gogh; Suh, 242&lt;/ref&gt; Rey's mother reportedly deemed the portrait “hideous” and used to close a hole in the family's chicken coop.

==Early life==
He was educated at the [[City of London School]]. In 1890 he entered the [[Royal Academy School]], where he gained a free medal, and afterward a scholarship in the [[Institution of British Artists]]. He showed his interest in [[Jewish]] matters by his drawings ''A Difficult Passage in the [[Talmud]]'' and ''The Blessing of Sabbath Lights,'' as well as by his ''Early Morning Prayer in the Synagogue.''

His older brother [[Jacob Snowman]] was a London medical doctor and prominent [[mohel]], who circumcised [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] and possibly other members of the [[British Royal Family]]. His younger brother was [[Emanuel Snowman]], the jeweller, politician and community leader.&lt;ref name=Palgrave /&gt;

==Career==
In that year, 1897, he formed a group of English Jews known as the [[Maccabaeans]], including [[Israel Zangwill]] and [[Herbert Bentwich]], which undertook a pilgrimage to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the same year. &lt;ref&gt;Palestine Post, 17 March 1947, p. 3; ibid, 27 March 1949, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of his paintings, which were devoted mainly to portraits and domestic views, ''Children's Voices'' (1901) attracted a great deal of attention, and ''The Bride'' (1904) was very popular at the time. He also exhibited a study of ''Sardanapalus,'' as well as ''The Wailing-Place at Jerusalem'' and ''The Proclamation of Joseph as Ruler of Egypt.''

==Personal life==
Isaac Snowman was married to Pearl Alexander at the North London Synagogue on 13 September 1898. According to the report in ''[[The Times]]'' the marriage was never a happy one for the wife owing to the husband's exaggerated views on the subject of "wifely obedience." They lived in [[Algiers]] and [[Hampstead]], and after their son died they adopted a daughter.

In August 1907, Isaac Snowman left for Africa to execute a commission for the King of [[Dahomey]]. Subsequently Pearl filed for divorce on grounds of statutory desertion and adultery, which was granted in June 1909. &lt;ref&gt;The Times, 10 June 1909, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac meantime continued to build his career. He was commissioned to paint portraits of King George V and Queen Mary, and it was said he was one of the Queen’s favourite artists. 21] Serious artworks enabled him to commission the first house on the now know Hocroft Estate to be built in Ranulf Road off Finchley Road. The house, now number 3, included dedicated artists work space: completed in about 1911, was for many years simply known as ‘The Studio’. Isaac sent five works to the R.A. from this 3 Ranulf Road. This area would have been well known to him, as it was just a few minutes walk from his old home in Fortune Green Road.

Isaac Snowman moved to [[Jerusalem]], where he had a studio over the [[Damascus Gate]]. In the riots that occurred in Jerusalem on 2 November 1921, Snowman encountered a mob and, while trying to make his way through with two friends, was stabbed. &lt;ref&gt;''The Jewish Chronicle'', 28 November 1921, p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
The outbreak of the [[Second World War]] found Snowman on a visit to England and his failing health prevented him from returning to his home in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;''Palestine Post'', 17 March 1947, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaac Snowman died peacefully on 11 February 1947, and his funeral was held the following day at Willesden Cemetery. &lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 February 1947, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Khurja pottery''' is traditional Indian pottery work manufactured in [[Khurja]] of the [[Bulandshahr district|Bulandshahr]] district in [[Uttar Pradesh]] state, [[India]]. Khurja pottery has been protected under the [[Geographical indication]] (GI) of the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) agreement. It is listed at item 178 as "Khurja Pottery" of the GI Act 1999 of the Government of India with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf |title=State Wise Registration Details Of G.I Applications |accessdate=4 February 2016 |publisher=Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201065403/http://ipindia.nic.in/girindia/treasures_protected/registered_GI_18November2015.pdf |archivedate= 1 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Origin of Khurja’s pottery work has been said with at least two different stories. In one legend, Afghan King [[Timur|Taimur Lung]] accompanied [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] and [[Syrian]] potters during his campaign in the Khurja region over 500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/lucknow/GI-certificate-to-preserve-uniqueness-of-Khurja-pottery/articleshow/47498632.cms | title=GI certificate to preserve uniqueness of Khurja pottery | publisher=The Times of India | date=1 June 2015 | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another legend, potters had been moved to the region during [[Mughal Empire]] while another version says there we no long historical events in accordance with pottery tradition in Khurja.

However, the author of "Pottery-making Cultures and Indian Civilization" mentioned that "Khurja in Bulandshaher is one of the oldest centers for glazed pottery in India". Further mentioned, "These potters often call themselves as Multani Kumhars suggesting that their origin was [[Multan]]”.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://r4d.dfid.gov.uk/PDF/Outputs/R74134.pdf | title=Mechanisms to Improve Energy Efficiency in Small Industries | publisher=Policy Research International | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern-day pottery manufacture flourished in the 1940s, and the Uttar Pradesh government set up a pottery factory in 1942. Later, the factory was closed in 1946–47 due to lack of quality. In 1952, the factory was changed as Pottery Development Centre. From 1942 until now, some adoption, transformation, initiative were taken by various actors for the betterment of pottery manufacture that resulted an importance role of Khurja pottery in national level as well as export to foreign countries.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch" /&gt;

== Production ==
There are about 15,000 people as official employees while about 25,000 unofficial employees who work in 500-odd units and nearly 400 factories. They produce several kinds of items such as crockery wares, art wares, electrical goods, sanitary wares, tiles, household items, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ghumakkar.com/khurja-the-ceramics-city/ | title=ROAD TRIP TO KHURJA – THE CERAMICS CITY | accessdate=6 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Khurja pottery has market in India and foreign countries. There are nearly 23 export oriented units. Reports say that production has received around 2,500 million Indian Rupees worth of item in 1999–2000 including 148.2 million Indian Rupees worth of export.&lt;ref name="PolicyResearch" /&gt;

It is the debut feature of director-editor Jeff Malmberg. It was the inspiration for ''[[Welcome to Marwen]]'', a 2018 drama directed by [[Robert Zemeckis]].&lt;ref name="hollywoodreporter.com"&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/robert-zemeckis-direct-marwencol-universal-650730]"Robert Zemeckis to Direct 'Marwencol' for Universal"  "The Hollywood Reporter" hollywoodreporter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;[https://variety.com/2017/film/news/universal-robert-zemeckis-steve-carell-pic-for-november-2018-1202403338/] "Universal Dates Robert Zemeckis-Helmed Steve Carell Pic for November 2018" variety.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
On April 8, 2000, Mark Hogancamp was attacked outside of a bar by five men who beat him nearly to death after he told them he was a cross-dresser.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Green |first=Penelope |date=2011-04-06 |title=In a Tiny Universe, Room to Heal |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/07/garden/07marwencol.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After nine days in a coma and forty days in the hospital, Hogancamp was discharged with brain damage that left him little memory of his previous life. Unable to afford therapy, he creates his own by building a 1/6-scale [[World War II]]-era [[Belgian]] town in his yard and populating it with dolls representing himself, his friends, and even his attackers.  He calls that town "[[Marwencol]]," blending the names "Mark," "Wendy" and "Colleen."

Hogancamp was initially discovered by photographer David Naugle, who documented and shared his story with [[Esopus (magazine)|''Esopus'']] magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|title=Marwencol on My Mind|last=Hogancamp|first=Mark|date=Fall 2005|website=[[Esopus (magazine)|Esopus]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060511082836/http://www.esopusmag.com/archivesubright.php?Id=3199&amp;pID=3014|archive-date=2006-05-11|dead-url=yes|access-date=|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then his work was shown in a [[New York City|New York]] [[Contemporary art gallery|art gallery]].

==Production==
The film was shot in [[New York State]] between 2006 and 2010, using a combination of [[DVCAM]] video and [[Super-8]] film formats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.documentary.org/magazine/2010-jacqueline-donnet-emerging-documentary-filmmaker-award-cutting-path-understanding-jeff|title=2010 Jacqueline Donnet Emerging Documentary Filmmaker Award--Cutting a Path of Understanding: Jeff Malmberg|last=Lanthier|first=Joseph Jon|date=2010-12-02|work=International Documentary Association|access-date=2017-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received widespread critical acclaim, holding a 98% approval rating out of a total of 59 reviews on review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/marwencol/]"Marwencol" rottentomatoes.com&lt;/ref&gt; The site awarded the film its "Golden Tomato" Award for the best-reviewed documentary of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/guides/golden_tomato_awards_2010/genre/documentary/]"2010 Golden Tomato Awards" rottentomatoes.com&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called the film "an exhilarating, utterly unique experience" while the ''[[Village Voice]]'' said that it's "exactly the sort of mysterious and almost holy experience you hope to get from documentaries and rarely do."

'''''Orca Symphony No. 1''''' is the fourth [[studio album]] by Armenian-American singer [[Serj Tankian]]. The album takes the form of a classical symphony.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.noisecreep.com/2012/05/10/serj-tankian-solo-album/|title = Serj Tankian on Being Eclectic, Growing Up in Lebanon and His Relationship With Heavy Metal|publisher = [[Noisecreep]]|date = May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A professionally sampled studio version was released on November 30, 2012, while the live recorded version was released on June 25, 2013 through [[Serjical Strike Records]].&lt;ref name=Release&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.serjtankian.com/news/serj-releasing-two-albums-june-and-july-announces-tour-dates|title = Serj Releasing Two Albums in June and July, Announces Tour Dates|publisher = [[Serj Tankian]]|date = April 25, 2013|accessdate = April 25, 2013|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140307195500/http://www.serjtankian.com/news/serj-releasing-two-albums-june-and-july-announces-tour-dates|archivedate = March 7, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A sample of the first act of the album was released on Tankian's [[SoundCloud]] page on May 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://soundcloud.com/serjtankian/orca-act-i-short-sample|title = ORCA - Act I Short Sample|publisher = [[SoundCloud]]|accessdate = April 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Tankian achieved fame as part of the American rock band [[System of a Down]]. Although the band experimented with various sounds,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author = Chris Nettleton|url =  http://drownedinsound.com/releases/4822/reviews/6744|title = Review of ''System of a Down''|publisher = [[Drowned in Sound]]|accessdate = July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; it wasn't until the band went on hiatus in 2006 that Tankian began to launch his solo career and experiment further.

Tankian's experimentation with classical composition began with ''[[Elect the Dead Symphony]]''. The live album featured the [[Auckland Philharmonia Orchestra]] performing reworked versions of songs from Tankian's debut album ''[[Elect the Dead]]''. His second album, ''[[Imperfect Harmonies]]'', blended classical with traditional rock elements. Tankian described the album as "music that has sat in the vat and matured",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legacy.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=144365|title=Serj Tankian Discusses 'Imperfect Harmonies' Album In New Video Interview|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|date=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; referring to the album's influences from several genres.

''Orca Symphony No. 1'', however, is his first complete symphony. The album is structured into four acts that were composed using "non-traditional approaches to classical music." According to Tankian, "''[[Orca]]'' is known as the killer whale, but is really a dark dolphin, a symbolism for human dichotomy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.serjtankian.com/content/composing|title = Composing|publisher = SerjTankian.com|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110106140654/http://www.serjtankian.com/content/composing|archivedate = 2011-01-06|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Touring==
An orchestral tour supporting ''Orca Symphony No. 1'' will take place after the [[System of a Down]] summer tour.&lt;ref name=Release/&gt; Shows will feature all four acts of the album and will also incorporate performances of many songs from ''[[Elect the Dead Symphony]]''.&lt;ref name=Release/&gt;

The idea of "order" is generally recognized as a key cliche for describing [[Culture of Germany|German culture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tomalin|first=Barry|title=Germany - Culture Smart!: The Essential Guide to Customs &amp; Culture|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=neGgAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22Ordnung+muss+sein%22&amp;dq=%22Ordnung+muss+sein%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=E67fTrauLZSutwfOxbjMBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA|year=2006|publisher=Kuperard|isbn=978-1-85733-306-0|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Franz von Papen]], for instance, cited it in 1932 as [[Frederick the Great]]'s "classic expression".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodd|first=William J.|title=Jedes Wort wandelt die Welt: Dolf Sternbergers politische Sprachkritik|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0_PqTRgZOoC&amp;pg=PA143|year=2007|publisher=Wallstein|isbn=978-3-8353-0230-3|page=143|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a slogan used by [[Paul von Hindenburg]], it became "world famous" in 1930, according to ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1930/11/09/archives/german-pilots-course-is-a-long-hard-grind-work-at-transport-school.html|title=GERMAN PILOTS COURSE IS A LONG, HARD GRIND; Work at Transport School From Which von Gronan Flew Is Arduous--25 in 1,000 Applicants Get In|last=Graudenz|first=John|date=9 November 1930|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer version is contained in a mid-19th century collection of proverbs where the title is a [[Wellerism]]: {{lang|de|Ordnung muss sein, sagte Hans, da brachten sie ihn in das Spinnhaus}} (in English: "Order must be, said Hans, as they took him to the madhouse)."&lt;ref name=simrock&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAs-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA361|title=Die deutschen Sprichwörter|last=Simrock|first=Karl|author-link=Karl Joseph Simrock|year=1846|location=Frankfurt am Main|page=361|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Related German proverbs are {{lang|de|Ordnung ist das halbe Leben}},&lt;ref name=simrock/&gt; literally "order is half of life", humorously extended in the [[Anti-proverb|antiproverb]] {{lang|de|und Unordnung die andere Hälfte}} ("and disorder the other half"). Similarly, a proverb says {{lang|de|Wer Ordnung hält, ist nur zu faul zum Suchen}} meaning "he who keeps order is just too lazy to spend his time searching".{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

There is an {{lang|de|[[Municipal police (Germany)|Ordnungsamt]]}} (Public Office for Order, [[Code enforcement]]) in every German municipality and city. Minor or petty offenses are called {{lang|de|Ordnungswidrigkeit}} (meaning "offense, (or rather) contrarity to (public) order" or indeed the American (among others) similar concept of disorderly conduct).

[[File:Cromwell,Thomas(1EEssex)01.jpg|thumb|''Portrait of [[Thomas Cromwell]]''. Oil and tempera on oak panel, 781 mm x 619 mm, [[National Portrait Gallery, London]]]]

The '''''Portrait of Thomas Cromwell''''' is a small oil painting by the  German and Swiss artist [[Hans Holbein the Younger]], and is usually dated c. 1532-1534, when [[Thomas Cromwell|Cromwell]] was around 48 years old. It is one of two portraits Holbein painted of him; the other is a [[Tondo (art)|tondo]] from a series of medallions of [[House of Tudor|Tudor]] courtiers.&lt;ref name="s276"&gt;Strong, 276&lt;/ref&gt; 

The original panel is lost, known only from three copies: in the [[Frick Collection]] in New York (where it is hung opposite Holbein's ''[[Portrait of Sir Thomas More (Holbein)|Portrait of Thomas More]]''); in the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] in London and the Chichester Constable collection in Yorkshire. The Frick panel is considered superior in quality.&lt;ref name="s277"&gt;Strong, 277&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subject==
[[File:Cardinal Thomas Wolsey.jpg|thumb|right|''Portrait of Cardinal Thomas Wolsey'', c. 1585-1596]]
[[Thomas Cromwell]] was a lawyer and statesman who began as a blacksmith's son in [[Putney]], and rose to power as an associate of [[Cardinal Wolsey]]. After Wolsey's fall and a period of initial distrust, he became a confidant of Henry VIII, assuming the roles of vice-regent, Lord Chancellor, lord high chamberlain, amongst others. A shrewd politician, he was aware of the effect of propaganda and commissioned Holbein to produce images positioning him as a reformist and royalist, including anti-clerical woodcuts and the title page for [[Myles Coverdale]]'s English translation of the bible. In this he was both progressive and atuned to Henry VIII's grandiose programme of artistic patronage. The king's efforts to glorify his own status as Supreme Head of the Church culminated in the building of [[Nonsuch Palace]], started in 1538.&lt;ref&gt;Strong, 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hans Holbein, the Younger - Sir Thomas More - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Portrait of Sir Thomas More (Holbein)|Portrait of Sir Thomas More]],'', 1527. Cromwell was instrumental in establishing the English Reformation, and played a key role in More's downfall]]
Cromwell engineered the king's divorce from [[Catherine of Aragon]]. He was an early ally of [[Anne Boleyn]] but played a key role in her downfall. He was a significant force in the Tudor court until, hoping to strengthen the political alliance with the Protestant cause in Germany, he erred in advising Henry to marry [[Anne of Cleves]].&lt;ref&gt;Cust, 5&lt;/ref&gt; The move was unpopular and afforded his many enemies the chance to bring charges of treason, forcing his eventual arrest and beheading.

This left Holbein in an uncertain position; his guile had allowed him survive the downfalls of More and Anne, but Cromwell's sudden fall badly damaged his reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, 260–64&lt;/ref&gt; Although he managed to retain his position as King's painter, his standing never recovered.

==Description==
The portrait seems to date from Holbein's second visit to England, when the sitter was acting on behalf of [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and commissioned a series of propagandistic images of favoured courtiers at a time when Cromwell's reputation was at its highest. He had emerged as the "Protestant counterweight to [[Thomas More]] in the [[Privy council]]",&lt;ref name="E&amp;H167"&gt;Erickson; Hulse, 167&lt;/ref&gt; sealed [[Anne Boleyn]]'s position in bitter circumstance, and became one of the most influential and powerful men in England. At the same time he was cultured and instrumental in promoting Holbein's career.&lt;ref name="E&amp;H167"&gt;Erickson; Hulse, 167&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps because of this, and given the portrait's genesis is steeped in the high and bloody politics of the time, with an unsteady king, we know nothing of Holbein's thoughts on the depiction.

Cromwell is given due respect, but is presented as sour and somewhat stiff. The eyes are narrowly set, he tightly grips the seal. His reputation was poor until revision in the 1960s; today he is seen as a reformer and a highly capable, supreme political operator. Reflecting earlier opinion, it was noted that "of all the portraits that Holbein did at the English court, the portrait of Cromwell has always seemed the least flattering to its subject, the most viciously mocking."&lt;ref name="E&amp;H167" /&gt; Mindful of the protracted, fatal relationship between Cromwell and More, and their placing at the Frick, Henry Clay romantically asked that we "imagine Thomas More, the beautiful saint, and Cromwell, the monster, united in art and history, now facing each other, [through] Holbein and time and chance."&lt;ref name="E&amp;H169"&gt;Erickson; Hulse, 169&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thomas Cromwell, portrait miniature with fur collar, after Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|This [[portrait miniature]] is derived from the 1532 portrait of Cromwell but shows him looking older. A similar miniature, without the Garter collar, survives and is attributed to Holbein by the [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]], but most scholars do not consider it an original Holbein]]
Compared to Holbein's other portraits of Tudor politicians, Cromwell seems reduced; he is placed low in the frame, deep in the pictorial space, placing a distance and diminishing him from the viewer. The table reaches into the immediate foreground as if reaching into the viewer's personal space.&lt;ref name="E&amp;H167"/&gt; Holbein presents Cromwell as somewhat sour, cold and grim, yet the portrait has been described as "a softened version of the subject". Historian [[R. B. Merriman]] described Cromwell as "a short, stoutly built man, with a large face, smooth shaven, with close-cropped hair, and a heavy double chin, with a small and cruel mouth, an extraordinary long upper lip, and a pair of gray eyes set closely together, and moving restlessly under his light eyebrows."&lt;ref name="g541"&gt;Goldwin, 541&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The same source compares Cromwell to [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], mentions criminal "intentions" and supposed "contempt for ordinary morality". See: Goldwin, 542&lt;/ref&gt;

The inscription on the border reads "To our trusty and right well, beloved Councillor, Thomas Cromwell, Master of our Jewel House". Cromwell sits on a bench before a table holding a legal document. His left hand has a patterned gold ring with a large green gemstone.  He is dressed in sober colours,&lt;ref name="npa"&gt;"[http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw02128/Thomas-Cromwell-Earl-of-Essex Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex]". National Portrait Gallery. Retrieved  27 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; comprising a black fur lined overcoat, a black hat and a "severe expression".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.museothyssen.org/en/thyssen/ficha_obra/822 Portrait of Thomas Cromwell]". Museo Thyssen-Bornemisza. Retrieved  27 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The table is covered with a green cloth. Some of his effects are placed on it, including a quill, a devotional book, scissors and a leather bag.&lt;ref name="npa" /&gt;

==Attribution and dating==
If the dating of the painting is accepted as c 1532-4, Cromwell was then [[Master of the Jewel House]]. In real terms he exercised much higher influence.&lt;ref name="s276" /&gt; The original portrait probably showed a painted scroll above his head, the text of the Frick version was removed during an early 20th restoration/improvement. The wording seems likely designed to position Cromwell beside the king. It read "To our trusty and right well beloved Councillor, Thomas Cromwell, Master of our Jewel House". the wording exists in a 1915 photograph of the Frick painting, but was removed. That panel underwent extensive technical analysis in 1952, and was cleaned in 1966; work that "did not substantiate an attribution to Holbein", but rather indicated the hand of a less skilled, workshop member.&lt;ref name="s276" /&gt;

==Provenance==
In an undated inventory from Cromwell's London home, an unknown writer mentions "2 tables of my master his (vis)namy painted". Little is known of the original after that. Only hours after Cromwell was taken to [[Traitors' Gate]] on 1 June 1540, soldiers arrived at his house to remove his belongings to the treasury, a fate that befallen Moore some five years earlier. Holbein's portrait was most likely destroyed or sold soon after Cromwell's fall; there is no record of it in any later royal inventory.&lt;ref name="s277" /&gt;

The first mention of copies is in the records of the Countess of Caledon from 1866 when she lent it to National Portrait Exhibition. That version is now in the Frick collection.&lt;ref name="s277" /&gt; Art scholar [[Roy Strong]] believed that the three extant portraits are copies. They are all in poor condition but the Frick version is the best preserved.&lt;ref name="s277" /&gt; Historian John Rowlands deduced from the ''pentimenti'' (alteration) revealed by X-ray photographs that the Frick version shows the hand of Holbein and is the original. The art historian Stephanie Buck agrees with the attribution, although it is highly contentious. Strong counters that as a traitor, Cromwell's personal effects were destroyed soon after his execution.

'''Pulque''' {{Audio-IPA|Pulque1.ogg|['pulke]|}} (occasionally referred to as '''agave wine'''{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}) is an  [[alcoholic beverage]] made from the [[fermentation (food)|fermented]] sap of the [[Agave americana|maguey (agave)]] plant.

==Description==
Pulque is a milk-colored, somewhat [[Viscosity|viscous]] liquid that produces a light foam.  It is made by fermenting the [[sap]] of certain types of maguey (agave) plants. In contrast, [[mezcal]] is made from the cooked heart of certain agave plants, and [[tequila]], a variety of mezcal, is made all or mostly from the [[blue agave]]. About six varieties of maguey are best used for the production of pulque.&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;{{cite news  |title= Aztecs' Sacred Drink Pulque Losing Out to Beer in Mexico |url= http://www.medindia.net/news/Aztecs-Sacred-Drink-Pulque-Losing-Out-to-Beer-in-Mexico-29730-1.htm   |agency=Medindia |date=2007-11-23 |accessdate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; The name ''pulque'' is derived from [[Nahuatl]]. The original name of the drink was ''iztāc octli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈistaːk ˈokt͡ɬi|}} (white pulque), the term pulque was probably mistakenly derived by the Spanish from the ''octli poliuhqui'' {{IPA-nah|ˈokt͡ɬi poˈliwki|}}, which meant "spoiled pulque".&lt;ref name="restaurantes"&gt;{{cite web  |title=El pulque, bebida de los dioses |url=http://www.restaurantesdemexico.com.mx/249/Vinos_y_Bebidas_El_Pulque__Bebida_De_Los_Dioses.html  |publisher=Restaurantes de Mexico |trans-title=Pulque: The Drink of the Gods |language=Spanish |doi= |date=2009-09-13  |accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maguey==
[[File:Maguey.jpg|thumb|Close up of a maguey plant]]
The maguey plant, also called a "century plant" in English, is native to Mexico. It grows best in the cold, dry climates of the rocky central highlands to the north and east of [[Mexico City]], especially in the states of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Tlaxcala]]. Maguey has been cultivated at least since 200 CE in [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]], [[Tulancingo]] and [[Teotihuacan]], and wild plants have been exploited for far longer. The plant historically has had a number of uses. Fibers can be extracted from the thick leaves to make rope or fabric, its thorns can be used as needles or punches and the membrane covering the leaves can be used as paper or for cooking.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |first=Beatriz |last=Oliver Vega |title=El uso de maguey |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6844-El-uso-del-maguey |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |trans-title=Use of Maguey |language=Spanish |date=April–May 1995 |accessdate=13 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417030644/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6844-El-uso-del-maguey |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''maguey'' was given by the Spanish, who picked it up from the [[Taíno people|Taíno]]. This is still its common name in Spanish, with ''Agave'' being its scientific generic or technical name. The [[Nahuatl]] name of the plant is ''metl''.&lt;ref name="soumaya"&gt;{{cite web |first=Mónica López |last=Velarde Estrada |title=El Descubrimiento del Pulque |url=http://www.soumaya.com.mx/navegar/anteriores/anteriores05/febrero/edp.html |publisher=Soumaya Museum |location=Mexico City |trans-title=The Discovery of Pulque |language=Spanish |accessdate=3 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218233426/http://www.soumaya.com.mx/navegar/anteriores/anteriores05/febrero/edp.html |archivedate=18 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mythological origins===
[[File:Mayahuel 1.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the goddess Mayahuel]]

Pulque has been drunk for at least 1,000 years, and its origins are the subject of various stories and myths. Most involve [[Mayahuel]], the goddess of the maguey. It was thought that the aguamiel collecting in the center of the plant was her blood. Other deities, such as the [[Centzon Totochtin]] (400 rabbits) are associated with it, by representing the drink's effects, and are the children of Mayahuel.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;  Another version involving ''Mayahuel'' has her as a mortal woman who discovered how to collect aguamiel but someone named ''Pantecatl'' {{IPA-nah|panˈtekat͡ɬ|}} discovered how to make pulque.&lt;ref name="soumaya"/&gt;

According to another story, pulque was discovered by the ''Tlacuache'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaˈkʷat͡ʃe|}} ([[opossum]]), who used his human-like hands to dig into the maguey and extract the naturally fermenting juice. He became the first drunk. ''Tlacuache'' was thought to set the course of rivers.  The rivers he set were generally straight except when he was drunk. Then they follow ''Tlacuache's'' meandering path from cantina to cantina.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Another account traces the discovery of aguamiel to the [[Toltec Empire]], when a noble named Papantzin was trying to get the emperor to marry his daughter [[Xochitl (Toltec)|Xochitl]]. He sent her to the capital with an offering of ''aguamiel'', honey of the agave plant. The emperor and princess wed, and their son was named ''Meconetzin'' {{IPA-nah|mekoˈnet͡sin|}} (maguey son).&lt;ref name="Xochitl"&gt;{{cite news |first=Edmundo  |last=Domínguez Aragonés |title=Xiuhtlaltzin, primera reina tolteca y Xóchitl, reina tolteca descubridora del pulque  |trans-title=Xiuhtlaltzin, the first Toltec queen and Xochitl, the Toltec queen who discovered pulque |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldemexico/notas/n564920.htm |newspaper=El Sol de Mexico |location=Mexico City  |date= 2008-01-20 |accessdate=13 September 2009 |language=Spanish  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of the story, Xochitl is credited with discovering pulque.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

===Pre-Hispanic period===
[[File:Codex_Mendoza_folio_61r.jpg|thumb|left|[[Codex Mendoza]], an early 16th-century manuscript, showing Aztec elders and pulque in a vessel (lower center)]]
[[File:El descubrimiento del pulque, por José María Obregón.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''The discovery of pulque'' by nineteenth-century Mexican painter José Obregón.]]
The maguey was one of the most sacred and important plants in ancient Mexico. It had a privileged place in mythology, religious rituals and the Mesoamerican economy.  Pulque appears in a number of graphic representations from pre-colonial times, beginning with stone carvings from about 200 CE. The first major work involving pulque is a large mural called the "Pulque Drinkers", unearthed in 1968 at the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula|pyramid of Cholula]], [[Puebla]]. The most likely means of the discovery of aguamiel and fermented pulque was from the observation of rodents who gnaw and scratch at the plant to drink the seeping sap. Fermentation of the aguamiel can take place within the plant itself.&lt;ref name="barrios1013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |pages=10–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the indigenous peoples of the central highlands of Mexico, the imbibing of pulque was done only by certain people, under certain conditions. It was a ritual drink, consumed during certain festivals, such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god [[Mixcoatl]]. It was drunk by priests and sacrificial victims, to increase the priests' enthusiasm and to ease the suffering of the victim.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; There are many references in [[Aztec]] codices, such as the Borbonicus Codex, of pulque's use by nobility and priesthood to celebrate victories. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant women.&lt;ref name="barrios18"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of pulque was ritualized and the brewers were superstitious. They would abstain from sex during the fermentation period because they believed that sexual intercourse would sour the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=May 2009|publisher=Gotham Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period===

After the Conquest, pulque lost its sacred character, and both indigenous and Spanish people began to drink it.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; The Spanish initially made no laws regarding its use. It became a lucrative source of tax revenue, but by 1672, public drunkenness had become enough of a problem that the viceregal government created regulations to curtail its consumption. A maximum of 36 "[[pulqueria]]s" were permitted for Mexico City, which had to be located in open areas, be without doors and close at sundown. Food, music, dancing and the co-mingling of the sexes was prohibited. However, pulque continued to play a major role in the socioeconomic history of Mexico during colonial times and in the early years of [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]]. Through this period, it was the fourth largest source of tax revenue.&lt;ref name="barrios2022"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |pages=20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 17th century, the [[Jesuits]] began large-scale production of the drink to finance its educational institutions. In this way, the making of pulque passed from being a home-made brew to one commercially produced.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

=== Drunkenness in casta painting ===

The [[casta]] system of racial hierarchy was created in Spanish America for elites to classify individuals into groups based on phenotype and perceived social class, and give them characteristics that were supposedly inherent to their group. Often artists portrayed mixed-race castas. This form of [[Mexican art]] portrayed castas in settings that were typical of their social group. The portrayal of pulque was used to show polarization between different castas.  Before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], pulque was used for religious ceremonies in [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;William B. Taylor. ''Drinking, Homicide, and Rebellion in Colonial Mexican Villages''. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the arrival of the Spanish, consumption was widespread among Indigenous Americans and mixed-race castas. This led to many social problems including sexual crimes and violence within the population.

In casta painting, pulque depicted situations the Europeans saw as characteristic of the castas they portrayed. Some of these paintings incorporated images of indigenous Americans and Africans as drunk with bottles appearing in the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bristol|first=Joan|title=You Are What You Drink? Tequila, Maguey and Mexican Identity|url=http://www.globality-gmu.net/archives/2380|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a reason that "shortly after the conquests, colonial officials declared pulque abuse and Indian drunkenness a major concern and committed themselves to addressing its impacts on society".{{attribution needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kasiak|first=Neil Robert|title=Fermenting Identities: Race and Pulque Politics in Mexico City between 1519 and 1754|journal=Online Theses and Dissertations|year=2012|issue=Paper 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, some casta painters depicted different castas safely consuming and selling pulque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University|location=New Haven|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other casta painters depicted Indigenous Americans intoxicated in the streets, and incapacitated which as a result required their families to escort them home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Casta painting was used as a method of social commentary on the destructive use of pulque in everyday society. As the Spanish attempted to crack down on pulque, some casta painters depicted indigenous Americans in safe environments where even children were able to consume pulque. The paintings were meant to show that Spanish regulation was effective in controlling the consumption and distribution of pulque in the colonial period.

===Post colonial period===
[[File:Pulqueria en tacubaya.jpg|thumb|left|A [[pulqueria]] in [[Tacubaya]] in the 1880s]]
Production of pulque exploded after Independence, when the regulation of pulque producers ended, and Mexican nationalism increased.&lt;ref name="soumaya"/&gt; From then until the 1860s, pulque [[hacienda]]s multiplied, especially in Hidalgo and Tlaxcala states. In 1866, the first railway between [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and Mexico City began operations, crossing through Hidalgo. This line was soon known as the "Pulque Train" because it brought supplies of the drink daily to the capital. This production and easy shipment of the drink made Hidalgo rich, and gave rise to a "pulque aristocracy" made up of some of the most powerful families of this time: Torres Adalid, Pimenta y Fagoaga, Macedo and others. At its peak, there were about 300 pulque haciendas. Some still remain in the plains of [[Apan]] and [[Zempoala, Hidalgo|Zempoala]], in Hidalgo.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; Pulque hit its peak of popularity during the late 19th century, when it was enjoyed by rich and poor alike.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt; As late as 1953, Hidalgo and Tlaxcala still obtained 30 and 50% respectively of their total revenues from pulque. This has diminished since then since irrigation, roads and other infrastructure has made possible other, more lucrative enterprises.&lt;ref name="barriosp38"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
In spite of its former popularity, pulque represents only 10% of the alcoholic beverages consumed in Mexico today.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; Pulque is still consumed in Mexico, mostly in the central highlands and predominantly in rural and poor areas. It has acquired a general connotation of being something for the lower class, while consumption of European-style beer flourished throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name="brewers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Brewers sought to disparage pulque |url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=22910&amp;tabla=miami |agency=Wire Services |newspaper=El Universal |location=Miami |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615062222/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=22910&amp;tabla=miami |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex and delicate fermentation process of pulque had always limited the product's distribution, as it does not keep long and agitation during transport speeds degradation. Since pre-Hispanic times, its consumption has mostly been limited to the central highlands of Mexico.&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;

The decline of pulque began in the first decade of the 20th century, when the [[Mexican Revolution]] caused a decline in its production.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; In the 1930s, the government of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] campaigned against pulque, as part of an effort to reduce alcoholic consumption in general. But the most decisive factor to the decline of pulque has been the introduction of beer.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;

European immigrant beer brewers in the early 20th century had their own campaign against the native pulque, claiming that pulque producers used a ''muñeca'' (doll), a textile bag containing human or animal feces which was placed in the ''aguamiel'' to hasten the fermentation process. Some pulque producers have insisted that the ''muñeca'' is completely a myth, but modern historians suggest that it did happen, although only rarely.&lt;ref name="MacClancyHenry2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Jeremy M. MacClancy |author2= C.J.K. Henry |author3= Jeya Henry |author4= Helen Macbeth |title= Consuming the Inedible: Neglected Dimensions of Food Choice |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GSKrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 |year=2009 |publisher= Berghahn Books |isbn= 978-1-84545-684-9 |pages= 215–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer producers promoted the idea that pulque was generally made this way, generally by word of mouth and insinuation. This was done to inhibit pulque sales and to promote the consumption of beer, which they claimed was "rigorously hygienic and modern".&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mentira"&gt;{{cite news  |title= Mentira que se use excremento para elaborar pulque |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/254842.mentira-que-se-use-excremento-para-elaborar-p.html |newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon |location=Torreon, Coahuila |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy proved successful, with pulque now generally looked-down-upon and imbibed by relatively few people, with Mexican-brewed beer ubiquitous and extremely popular.&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mentira"/&gt; Pulque's popularity is low and continues to fall. Twenty years ago, about 20 trucks would come every three days to [[Xochimilco]] (in southern Mexico City) to deliver pulque, but now the number is down to one or two. Only five pulquerias remain in this district, where there used to be 18.&lt;ref name="sacred"/&gt; The situation is similar in most other parts of Mexico, as well. The remaining pulquerias are very small establishments, selling a product made by small producers.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

In the state of Hidalgo, in which most maguey is grown, fields of this plant are disappearing, with barley taking its place. Most maguey plants here serve as boundary markers between properties. Many of these plants do not survive long, as they are often vandalized. An estimated 10,000 plants are mutilated each week by cutting off the lower leaves for [[barbacoa]] or destroying them completely to look for the edible white grubs or ant eggs that can inhabit them.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Campos de Maguey.jpg|thumb|A field of maguey]]
The production process is long and delicate.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt; The maguey plant needs 12 years of maturation before the sap, or ''aguamiel'', can be extracted, but a good plant can produce for up to one year.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; This aguamiel can be drunk straight, but it is alcoholic only after a fermentation process that can start in the plant itself.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; This liquid is collected twice a day from the plant, yielding about five or six liters per day. Today, this liquid is collected with a steel scoop, but in the past, an elongated gourd was used as a tube to suck the juice out. Between gatherings, the plant's leaves are bent over the center where the juice collects to keep out bugs and dirt. This center is regularly scraped out to keep the plant's production of sap active. Most maguey plants produce this ''aguamiel'' for about four to six months before they finally die.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barrios"/&gt; Some plants can yield up to 600 [[Litre|L]] of pulque. &lt;!-- pp. 72 --&gt;&lt;ref name="Tompkins" &gt;Tompkins, P. (1976). Mysteries of the Mexican pyramids. Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Limited: Toronto. {{ISBN|0-06-014324-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collected juice is placed into 50-liter barrels and carried from the field to the fermentation vats. These vats, called ''tinas'', are located in a special building called a ''tinacal''. This word derives from Spanish ''tina'' and Nahuatl ''calli'' that means house of vats. When pulque haciendas reached their peak in the late 19th century, hacienda life revolved around these ''tinacals''. It typically was a rectangular shed of stone with a wooden roof. The upper parts of the walls opened for air circulation and the façades were sometimes decorated with indigenous designs or other images associated with the making of pulque. One popular motif was the discovery of pulque by Xochitl. Other popular elements were the images of the hacienda's patron saint and the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]. Inside were the vats, which were cowhide stretched over wooden frames lined up against the walls. In larger ''tinacals'', there were three or four rows of vats. Today, the ''tinas'' are made of oak, plastic or [[fiberglass]] and hold about 1,000 liters each.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barrios"/&gt;

[[Image:1964 Tlachiquero Hidalgo Mexico.jpg|thumb|A ''tlachiquero'' collecting maguey juice (1964, Hidalgo, Mexico)]]
After placing the juice in the fermentation vats, mature seed pulque (''semilla'' or ''xanaxtli'') is added to "jump start" the process. Unlike beer, the fermenting agent present in pulque is a bacterium of the species ''[[Zymomonas mobilis]]'' (syn. ''Thermobacterium mobile'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/542|title=Zymomonas mobilis|website=www.uniprot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) rather than yeast. Those in charge of the fermentation process guard their trade secrets, passing them on from father to son. Fermentation takes from seven to 14 days, and the process seems to be more art than science. A number of factors can affect fermenting pulque, such as temperature, humidity and the quality of the ''aguamiel''.&lt;ref name="barrios"/&gt;

The process is complex and delicate, and can go sour at any point. For this reason, and perhaps due to its ancient "sacred" character, there are rituals and prohibitions. Religious songs and prayers may be offered, and women, children and strangers are not allowed inside the ''tinacal''.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; Other superstitions include those against eating canned fish and wearing a hat inside the tinacal. The first is claimed to cause a bad taste in the pulque and the second is considered bad luck. To cleanse the bad luck, the offender must fill the hat with pulque and drink it down.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;

Just before the peak of fermentation, the pulque is quickly shipped to market in barrels. The fermentation process is continuous, so the pulque must be consumed within a certain time before it spoils.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;

==Consumption==

[[File:DanielVeraSierra05.JPG|thumb|left|Customers at Pulquería Tecolote]]
Most pulque is consumed in bars called ''pulquerías''. At the beginning of the 20th century, more than 1,000 were located in Mexico City alone.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; By the early 20th century, ''pulquerías'' became socially accepted, and some were places of great elegance. But whether for rich or poor, two features stood out among these establishments: odd or catchy names, and murals decorating the walls. Names included (translated) "My Office", "Memories of the Future", "Drink and Go", "I'm Waiting for You Here at the Corner", and, across the street from the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|National Chamber of Deputies]], "The Recreation Center of Those Across the Street". [[Diego Rivera]] once said one of the most important manifestations of Mexican painting was the murals that decorated the facades and interiors of ''pulquerías''. One tradition maintained at all'' pulquerias ''at the beginning of the 20th century was to put sawdust on the floor. The tradition at that time was to begin a pulque-drinking session by spilling a little on the floor or ground as an offering to Mother Earth.&lt;ref name="barrios2223"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional ''pulquerías'' tend to be like clubs with closed membership, with casual visitors ignored or sometimes stared at. Frequent visits and large consumption of the drink tends to win acceptance.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; While some establishments may forbid women,&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; it is much more common for the establishment to provide a separate seating area for them. Intermingling of the sexes is not permitted.&lt;ref name="dioses"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jorge  |title= El Pulque "La Bebida de los Dioses"  |url=http://www.viajaydescubre.com/articulo/el-pulque-la-bebida-de-los-dioses/ |trans-title=Pulque, the Drink of the Gods |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809151719/http://www.viajaydescubre.com/articulo/el-pulque-la-bebida-de-los-dioses/ |archivedate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="resusitan"&gt;{{cite web |first=Virginia |last=Avila  |title= Resusitan pulquerías del siglo XIX, aquí |url= http://www.e-consulta.com/oaxaca/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=4719 |trans-title=Resuscitating 19th century pulque bars here |date=2008-12-18 |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nuestro"&gt;{{cite web |title= Nuestro Pulque |url= http://pulquenuestro.blogspot.com/2009/06/10-de-algunas-cosas-que-hacen-una.html |trans-title=Our Pulque |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the more rural areas of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala, where most pulque is made, the pulque is fresher and better. A vendor usually displays a white flag over the door when a fresh shipment has arrived.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;

Traditionally, pulque is served from large barrels on ice.&lt;ref name="dioses"/&gt; and served into glasses, using a ''jicara'', which is a half of a calabash tree gourd. The bartender is called a ''jicarero''. In a ''pulquería'', ''cruzado'', meaning something like "bottoms up", is a frequent salute.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;
[[File:PulqueGlasswareMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Traditional glassware for pulque ''circa'' 1950 on display at the Museo de Artes Populares, Mexico City]]
Drinking glasses have colorful names and can reflect a customer's ability to drink pulque. Large two-liter glasses are called ''macetas'' (flower pots), one-liter glasses are called ''cañones'' (cannons), half–liters are called  ''chivitos'' (little goats), quarter-liter glasses are ''catrinas'' (dandies), and eighth-liter glasses are ''tornillos'' (screws). Traditionally, these glasses are made from a greenish, hand blown glass.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; Pulque can be drunk straight from the barrel or can have a number of additives, such as fruit or nuts, added. Pulque prepared this way is called ''curado'' or cured.&lt;ref name="dioses"/&gt;

One of the limitations to pulque's popularity has been the inability to store it for long periods or ship it far. Recently, pulque makers have found a way to preserve the beverage in cans. However, they admit this does change the flavor. The hope is that with this innovation, pulque can regain its lost market in Mexico and even achieve success as an export item, like tequila.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt; It is already being offered in the United States by Boulder Imports, selling the brand "Nectar del Razo". The original market was Mexican-American men, but the company reports the product is having success as a health food, sought out by athletes and body builders.&lt;ref name="razo"&gt;{{cite web |title= Nectar del Razo|url= http://www.pocotequila.com/mextour/mex_agave/m3pulque.html  |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health benefits==
There is a saying that pulque "sólo le falta un grado para ser carne" – "it is only a bit shy of being meat",  referring to the nutritional value of the drink.&lt;ref name="resusitan"/&gt; This was recognized by the Mesoamericans, who allowed pregnant women and the elderly to imbibe what was normally reserved only for priests and nobility. Modern analysis of the liquid has found that it contains carbohydrates, [[vitamin C]], B-complex, D, E, [[amino acid]]s and minerals such as [[iron]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt;

==Pulque tourism==
From the glory days of pulque, the state of Hidalgo has about 250 pulque haciendas, many of which have been abandoned or converted to other uses, such as ranching. Their ''tinacals'' have either disappeared or been converted into storage or party rooms. A few remaining ones continue to make pulque, but use more modern and sanitary facilities.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; In Tlaxcala, the federal [[Secretary of Tourism (Mexico)|Secretariat of Tourism]] and the state government have organized a tour called the "Pulque Route", which includes the main haciendas that still make the beverage in this state. It is a two-day route which begins at the Church of La Barca de la Fe in [[Calpulalpan]] to the San Bartolo Hacienda, which is the principal exporter of canned pulque. This hacienda was the property of Ignacio Torres Adalid, who was called the "king of pulque". Today, it belongs to Ricardo del Razo. The tour also covers maguey fields like those around a town called Guillermo Ramirez.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt;
[[Image:Agave Pulque.JPG|thumb|A six pack of pulque]]

These old haciendas varied widely. Some were ostentatious with great architectural harmony such as the Montecillos Hacienda, of Spanish colonial style and originally built in the 17th century by the Jesuits or San Antonio Ometusco Hacienda built by architect Antonio Rivas Mercado. However, most haciendas were the result of a constructive process that started in the 16th century, with mixed architectural styles and methods of both Mexico and Europe. One characteristic feature is [[Neo-Gothic]] towers. The Santiago Tetlapayac Hacienda has murals related to [[charreada]] and attributed to the painter Icaza.  The Zotoluca Hacienda has an octangonal floorplan in [[Neo-Moorish]] style and was restored in the 1950s. But the center of each of these pulque haciendas is the tinacal. They were planned and decorated befitting their importance. Almost all have interesting architectural details, such as a specially decorated main doorway, murals or sculpted windows. Some are considered works of art, such as the tinacal at the Montecillos Hacienda or the one at the San Antonio Ometusco Hacienda, which also has an elegant canopy covering the shipping dock with moulded iron columns and walls decorated with murals relating to the history of pulque.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

'''Sentimentalism''' is a practice of being [[Sentimentality|sentimental]], and thus tending toward basing actions and reactions upon emotions and feelings, in preference{{cn|date=May 2018}} to reason.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;"sentimentalism, n.", ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]''&lt;/ref&gt; 

As a [[Mode (literature)|literary mode]], sentimentalism has been a recurring aspect of world literature. Sentimentalism includes a variety of aspects in literature, such as sentimental poetry, the sentimental novel, and the German sentimentalist music movement, [[Sensitive style|Empfindsamkeit]]. European literary sentimentalism arose during the [[Age of Enlightenment]], partly as a response to [[Moral sense theory|sentimentalism in philosophy]]. In eighteenth-century [[England]], the [[sentimental novel]] was a major literary genre.

== Philosophical influences ==


Sentimentalism in philosophy and sentimentalism in literature are sometimes hard to distinguish.{{cn|date=March 2013}} As the philosophical arguments developed, the literature soon tried to emulate by putting the philosophical into practice through narration and characters. As a result, it is common to observe both philosophical and literary movements simultaneously.

Philosophically, sentimentalism was often contrasted to [[rationalism]]. While 18th-century rationalism corresponded itself with the development of the analytic mind as the basis for acquiring truth, sentimentalism hinged upon an intrinsic human capacity to feel and how this leads to truth. For the sentimentalist this capacity was most important in morality ([[moral sense theory]]). Sentimentalists contended that where the rationalists believed morality was founded upon analytic principles (i.e. Immanuel Kant's "Categorical Imperative") these principles could not be adequately founded in the empirical nature of humans—such as observing a sad image or expressing a strong emotion physically. Therefore, one could not obtain a sound moral theory. However, by developing the moral sensibility and fine tuning the capacity to feel, a person could access a sound moral theory by building from an intrinsic human nature, which each person possessed. Sentimentalists were, thus, often seen as relating to the schools of humanism and empirical ethical intuitionism.

== Characteristics ==


Sentimentalism asserted that over-shown feeling was not a weakness but rather showed one to be a moral person.  Arising from religiously motivated empathy, it expanded to the other perceptions - for example, sensual love was no longer understood as a destructive passion ([[vanity|Vanitas]]) but rather as a basis of social institutions, as it was for [[Antoine Houdar de la Motte]].  Requited love was, as in serious opera (the [[Tragédie en musique]] or [[Opera seria]]), a symbol for a successful alliance between nations.  The "[[Lesesucht]]" re-evaluated what was permitted literature, and the novel as a type of literature as versus drama.  

Around the middle of the century, sentimentalism set "untouched" nature against (courtly) civilization, as in the works of [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]].  In addition, [[Samuel Richardson]]'s sentimental [[epistolary novel]] "[[Pamela, or Virtue Rewarded]]" (1740) had great literary influence.

The literary work often featured scenes of distress and tenderness, and the plot was arranged to advance emotions rather than action. The result was a valorization of "fine feeling," displaying the characters as a model for refined, moral and emotional effect. Sentimentalism in literature was also often used as a medium through which authors could promote their own agendas—imploring readers to empathize with the problems they are dealing with in their books.

For example, in Laurence Sterne's novel, ''[[A Sentimental Journey Through France and Italy]]'', the narrator is using the sentimental character Yorick as a device to critique the obligation of morality, whether it is sentimental or rational.  
There is a scene early in the novel where Yorick meets a monk and refuses "to give him a single sous [a penny]." He feels discontent when he disregards what he senses he ought to do, even though he appears to obey "better reason" (4). Rationally, he disregards his sentimental obligation because "there is no regular reasoning upon the ebbs and flows of our humours" (6) [i.e. our emotions]. While he argues against the authority of sense, ultimately this sense creates discontent in his conscience. After the monk leaves empty handed, it is Yorick's "heart" that "smote [him] the moment [the monk] shut the door" (7). Accordingly, Yorick has "behaved very ill" (7). He has complied with his rational maxim, the justified action of his "great claims" argument (6). Yet he senses from the conscience of his sentimental nature that he has done wrong.

== ''Empfindsamkeit'' ==

In continental Europe, one aspect of sentimentalism was ''Empfindsamkeit''. The [[sensitive style]] (German: ''empfindsamer Stil'') of music, developed in Germany, aimed to express "true and natural" feelings, in contrast to the [[Baroque music|baroque]].

The origin of sentimentalism in this context was chiefly religious, with the emotionally coloured texts for the [[oratorio]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] stream being typical examples.  Empfindsamkeit is also known as secularized [[pietism]] because it frequently came with moralizing content that had increasingly broken free of church and religious ties.  An important theorist of the movement was [[Jean Baptiste Dubos]].

===In Germany===
The musician and publisher [[Johann Christoph Bode]] translated [[Laurence Sterne]]'s novel, ''A sentimental Journey Through France and Italy'', into German in 1768 under the title ''Yoriks empfindsame Reise'' - the translation was a great success.  His word "empfindsam" or "sensitive" was a [[neologism]] that then became attached to [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and the whole literary period.

German poets who verged on sentimentalism were [[Friedrich Gottlieb Klopstock]] (1724–1803), [[Christian Fürchtegott Gellert]] (1715–1769) and [[Sophie de La Roche]] (1730–1807, the author of the first [[epistolary novel]] in German) and its influence may also be seen in [[Goethe]]'s early work ''[[Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774), a high-point of [[Sturm und Drang]].

===Results===
Religious sentimentalism has often been considered as inspiration for [[François-René de Chateaubriand]] and his creation of [[Romanticism]], which was another literary genre that emerged late in the 18th Century. In popular literature, Empfindsamkeit was a common genre that continued into the 19th Century, and was found in serialised novels in periodicals such as ''[[Die Gartenlaube|Gartenlaube]]''.  In a theatre sense, Empfindsamkeit was succeeded by [[melodrama|rührstück]] or melodrama.

'''Tale Spinners for Children''' was a series of stories and novels adapted for young audiences on vinyl records in the early 1960s. They included a collection of old [[fairy tales]], [[folklore]], literary classics such as ''[[Don Quixote]]'' and ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'', and time-honored [[fables]], with the title role sometimes played by a renowned theatrical actor or actress. (Many of the actors who appeared, however, such as [[Maggie Smith]] or [[Alec McCowen]], became more famous for other roles years after the albums were released, and some of the actors, such as [[Donald Pleasence]], who played Don Quixote, or [[John Wood (English actor)|John Wood]], who played several villainous roles, were not even identified on the album covers.) The series gave children an exposure to timeless classic stories.

Originally only 30 records were pressed in England and France and sold as [[Atlas Talespinners]] under the [[Atlas Record]] label, and included an easy to follow story booklet. Within a few years, these records were introduced to the U.S. as Tale Spinners for Children under the [[United Artists Records]] label. What was known as the Atlas Theatre Company in England was marketed as the Famous Theatre Company in the United States. The story booklets were not included in the U.S. releases.

UA continued to produce more stories records until the early 1970s, and distribute them in the Canadian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Canada by The Compo Company Ltd., Lachine, Que.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australian&lt;ref&gt;Manufactured and Distributed in Australia Under License from United Artists Records, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; markets as well.

With popular children's record companies like [[Walt Disney Records]] already on the market, a host of other record companies followed: [[Mercury Storyteller]] series, [[Golden Records]], [[Telegeneral Let's Pretend]], [[Riverside Wonderland]] and [[Pathways of Sound]].

==History==
United Artists released the 30 original stories in the US in 1962. The recording labels changed when [[Liberty Records]] (its budget subsidiary [[Sunset Records]]) and [[United Artists Records]]&lt;ref&gt;©LIBERTY/UA, INC., Los Angeles, Calf.&lt;/ref&gt;  merged in 1968 after [[Transamerica Corporation|Transamerica]]&lt;ref&gt;DEPT. SUS 6920 Sunset Blvd. Los Angeles, Calif. (90028)&lt;/ref&gt; bought Liberty. All labels were merged under United Artists in 1971. When Liberty was deactivated in 1971 (for the first time) both the Sunset and Talespinners series was leased by [[Springboard International]]&lt;ref&gt;Distributed by SPRINGBOARD INTERNATIONAL RECORDS, INC., 947 U.S. Highway 1, Rahway, New Jersey 07065&lt;/ref&gt; and in the case of the Talespinners series they used the same catalog numbers until 1975. When Springboard International Records went bankrupt 1984 [[Gusto Records]] acquired some of their catalogues from [[Jay-Koala]].

==Music==
''Tale Spinners for Children'' used classical music as background and linking music in their productions.  Examples of this include:
* ''Robin Hood'' (UAC 11001) - [[Violin Concerto (Mendelssohn)|Violin Concerto in E minor]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''William Tell'' (UAC 11002) - [[William Tell Overture]] and Overture from ''[[La Gazza Ladra]]'' by [[Gioachino Rossini]]
* ''The Three Musketeers'' (UAC 11007) - "The Dance of the Furies" from ''[[Orfeo ed Euridice]]'' by [[Christoph Gluck]]
* ''Treasure Island'' (UAC 11013) - [[Symphonie fantastique]] by [[Hector Berlioz]] ''(also used in "Hiawatha" [UAC 11054])''
* ''Sinbad the Sailor'' (UAC 110020) - [[Scheherazade (Rimsky-Korsakov)|Scheherazade]] by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]] ''(also used in "Ali Baba and the Forty Thieves" [UAC 11018] and "Aladdin and the Magic Lamp" [UAC 11019])''
* ''Rip Van Winkle'' (UAC 11034) - [[A Midsummer Night's Dream (Mendelssohn)|Overture for A Midsummer Night's Dream]] by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]
* ''Christopher Columbus'' (UAC 11040) - [[Symphony No. 9 (Dvořák)|New World Symphony]] by [[Antonín Dvořák]]

'''''The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius''''' is an [[altarpiece]] by Italian artist [[Carlo Crivelli]] showing an artistic adaptation of the [[Annunciation]]. The altarpiece was painted for the [[Santissima Annunziata, Ascoli Piceno|Church of SS. Annunziata]] in the Italian town of [[Ascoli Piceno]], in the region of [[Marche]], to celebrate the self-government granted to the town in 1482 by [[Pope Sixtus IV]].&lt;ref name="ng"&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/carlo-crivelli-the-annunciation-with-saint-emidius|title=The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius|publisher=[[The National Gallery]]| accessdate =26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The painting was removed to the [[Pinacoteca di Brera]] in Milan in 1811, but passed to [[Auguste-Louis de Sivry]] in 1820, and had reached England by the mid-19th century.  It has been housed in the [[National Gallery]] in [[London]] since it was donated by [[Henry Labouchere, 1st Baron Taunton]] in 1864.&lt;ref name="ng"/&gt;

'''''The Case of Wagner''''' ({{lang-de|Der Fall Wagner}}) is a book by the [[philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], originally published in 1888. Subtitled "A Musician's Problem", it has also been known as ''The Wagner Case'' in English. 

==Contents==
The book is a critique of [[Richard Wagner]] and the announcement of Nietzsche's rupture with the German artist, who had involved himself too much, in Nietzsche's eyes, in the [[Völkisch movement|''Völkisch'' movement]] and [[antisemitism]]. His music is no longer represented as a possible "philosophical affect," and Wagner is [[irony|ironically]] compared to [[Georges Bizet]]. However, Nietzsche  presents Wagner as only a particular symptom of a broader "disease" that is affecting Europe: that is, [[nihilism]]. The book shows Nietzsche as a capable music-critic, and provides the setting for some of his further reflections on the nature of art and its relationship to the future health of humanity.

This work is in sharp contrast with the second part of Nietzsche's ''[[The Birth of Tragedy]],'' wherein he praised Wagner as fulfilling a need in music to go beyond the analytic and dispassionate understanding of music. Nietzsche also praised Wagner effusively in his essay "Wagner at Bayreuth" (part of the ''[[Untimely Meditations (Nietzsche)|Untimely Meditations]]''), but his disillusion with Wagner the composer and the man was first seen in his 1878 work ''[[Human, All Too Human]]''.  One of the last works that Nietzsche wrote returned to the critical theme of ''The Case of Wagner''.  In ''[[Nietzsche contra Wagner]]'', Nietzsche pulled together excerpts from his works to show that he consistently had the same thoughts about music, only that he had misapplied them to Wagner in the earliest works.

[[Image:Soiling of Old Glory.jpg|thumb|right|''The Soiling of Old Glory'', by Stanley Forman.]]
'''''The Soiling of Old Glory''''' is a [[Pulitzer Prize]]&amp;ndash;winning photograph taken by [[Stanley Forman]] during the [[Boston busing crisis]] in 1976.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{Cite web| work=Slate | title=The Soiling of Old Glory | last=Masur | first=Louis P. | url=http://www.slate.com/id/2188648/ | date=2008-04-10 | accessdate=2008-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It depicts a white teenager, Joseph Rakes, assaulting a black man, lawyer and [[civil rights]] activist [[Ted Landsmark]], with a flagpole bearing the American flag (also known as [[Old Glory]]).

The image was taken for the ''[[Boston Herald American]]'' in [[Boston]] on April 5, 1976, during one in [[Boston busing desegregation|a series of protests]] against court-ordered [[Desegregation busing in the United States|desegregation busing]].&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; It ran on the front page of the ''Herald American'' the next day, and also appeared in several newspapers across the country.&lt;ref name="slate" /&gt; It won the [[1977 Pulitzer Prize]] for Spot Photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pulitzer.org/awards/1977|title=The Pulitzer Prize Winners, 1977|accessdate=2008-04-12|work=The Pulitzer Prizes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Landsmark was active in trying to get more minority contractors in the construction industry, but he hadn't been paying attention to the busing protests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; According to Landsmark, "I had difficulty finding a parking space in downtown Boston, and I was running a few minutes late for the meeting in city hall. So I was in a hurry and perhaps not paying as much attention as I might have as I approached a corner, where the young demonstrators were coming in the other direction. I did not see them until both they and I were at that corner."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Life After Iconic Photo: Today's Parallels Of American Flag's Role In Racial Protest | url=https://www.npr.org/2016/09/18/494442131/life-after-iconic-photo-todays-parallels-of-american-flags-role-in-racial-protes | accessdate=2016-09-18 | work=NPR }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakes was swinging the flag and trying to hit him, not trying to spear him as it appears in the photo, and he narrowly missed. Landsmark was bloodied during the incident.&lt;ref name="smithsonian"&gt;{{Cite web| title=Stars and Strife| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/indelible-apr06.html| access-date=2011-06-17 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120910153911/http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history-archaeology/indelible-apr06.html |archive-date=2012-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; An examination of all the photographs in the roll Forman shot reveals that Rakes missed Landsmark with the flag. Although anti-busing activist Jim Kelly appears to pin Landsmark's arms behind him, he is actually helping Landsmark to his feet. Kelly later positions himself between Landsmark and the other protestors to protect the lawyer. Landsmark had already been knocked to the ground, losing his glasses and suffering a broken nose, by the time the famous picture was taken.&lt;ref name=Salon&gt;{{cite web|last=Bayard|first=Louis|title=Flagging America’s racial divide|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/04/28/old_glory/|date=28 April 2008|work=Salon|accessdate=16 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rakes was convicted of assault with a deadly weapon and sentenced to two years imprisonment and two years probation. The jail sentence was suspended. In 1983 the Boston police issued a warrant alleging that Rakes had beaten to death the brother of his girlfriend.&lt;ref name="Boston Man Sought"&gt;{{cite news|title=Boston Man Sought on Murder Warrant|newspaper=The Day (New London, CT)|date=1 February 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He fled prosecution, but returned in 1988 after the murder charge was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ralph|first=James|title=The picture of hatred|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/chi-soilingbw19_dtapr19,0,2417168.story|accessdate=3 Dec 2016|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517152547/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/chi-soilingbw19_dtapr19,0,2417168.story|archivedate=17 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rakes carried the stigma of being known as "the flag kid", but eventually married and had children while laboring as a construction worker and later in hazardous waste.&lt;ref name=Salon /&gt;

'''''The Vision to the Youth Bartholomew''''' ({{lang-ru|Видение отроку Варфоломею}}) is a painting by the Russian artist [[Mikhail Nesterov]], the first and best known work in his series on [[Sergius of Radonezh]], a medieval Russian saint. It is considered "the inaugural work of the [[Russian Symbolist]] movement".&lt;ref name="auction"/&gt;

The image of St. Sergius of Radonezh, near and dear to the artist since childhood, was embodiment of the moral ideal for Nesterov. Particularly important role Nesterov gave St. Sergius in rallying the [[Russian people]]. The painting illustrates an episode from "The Life of St. Sergius" by [[Epiphanius the Wise]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
One day his father sent him to seek for a lost foal. On his way he met a monk, a venerable [[Starets|elder]], a stranger, a priest, with the appearance of an angel. This stranger was standing beneath an oak tree, praying devoutly and with much shedding of tears. The boy, seeing him, humbly made a low obeisance, and awaited the end of his prayers.

The venerable monk, when he had ended his prayers, glanced at the boy and, conscious that he beheld the chosen vessel of the [[Holy Spirit]], he called him to his side, blessed him, bestowed on him a kiss in the name of Christ, and asked: "What art thou seeking, or what dost thou want, child?" The boy answered, "My soul desires above all things to understand the [[Holy Scriptures]]. I have to study reading and writing, and I am sorely vexed that I cannot learn these things. Will you, holy Father, pray to God for me, that he will give me understanding of book-learning?" The monk raised his hands and his eyes toward heaven, sighed, prayed to God, then said, "Amen."

Taking out from his satchel, as it were some treasure, with three fingers, he handed to the boy what appeared to be a little bit of white wheaten bread prosphora, saying to him: "Take this in thy mouth, child, and eat; this is given thee as a sign of God's grace and for the understanding of Holy Scriptures. Though the gift appears but small, the taste thereof is very sweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.st-sergius.org/life1.html|title=Life of our Venerable Father amongst the Saints St Sergius of Radonezh|work=st-sergius.org|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;" 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sketches of landscapes the artist wrote in 1899 in the vicinity of the [[Trinity Sergius Lavra]], settling in the village Komyakovo near [[Abramtsevo Colony|Abramtsevo]] and [[Radonezh]]. Abramtzevo became one of the favorite places of Mikhail Nesterov.

There he finished top ([[landscape]]) part and went to [[Ufa]]. The artist hurried, because he was preparing for the XVIII [[Peredvizhniki|Peredvizhniki exhibition]] and despite having the [[flu]], continued to work actively. One day he felt dizzy, he stumbled (he stood on a small stool), fell and injured the canvas.

The painting, which caused the most contradictory opinions, became a sensation XVIII Peredvizhniki exhibition and was bought by [[Pavel Tretyakov]] for his gallery. Until the end of his days, the artist was convinced that "The Vision of the Youth Bartholomew" remained the best of his work. In old age, the artist used to say:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I won't be the one who lives. "Youth Bartholomew" will. If in thirty, in fifty years after my death, he will still be telling people something - that means he is alive, which means, I am alive.&lt;br/&gt; Жить буду не я. Жить будет «Отрок Варфоломей». Вот если через тридцать, через пятьдесят лет после моей смерти он ещё будет что-то говорить людям — значит, он живой, значит, жив и я&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://polit.ru/news/2014/05/31/nesterov/|title=Мемория. Михаил Нестеров|work=polit.ru|accessdate=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A later version of the painting, dating from 1922, was sold at [[Sotheby's]] in 2007 for $ 4,3 mln.&lt;ref name="auction"&gt;http://www.sothebys.com/en/auctions/ecatalogue/2007/russian-art-n08302/lot.353.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Thoreauviana |expanded=Core}}
The '''Thoreau Society''' is a [[literary society]] devoted to the works of [[Henry David Thoreau]], it is based in [[Concord, Massachusetts|Concord]], [[Massachusetts]], USA. Established in 1941, it  has long contributed to the dissemination of knowledge about Henry David Thoreau by collecting books, manuscripts, and artifacts relating to Thoreau and his contemporaries, by encouraging the use of its collections, and by publishing articles in two Society periodicals.

The Thoreau Society archives are housed at the Walden Woods Project's Thoreau Institute Library in [[Lincoln, Massachusetts]]. This repository includes the collections of Walter Harding and Raymond Adams, two of the foremost authorities on Thoreau and founders of the Thoreau Society; and those of [[Roland W. Robbins]], who uncovered Thoreau's Walden house site.

== Mission==
*To stimulate interest in and foster education about Thoreau's life, works, and philosophy and his place in his world and ours,
*To encourage research on Thoreau's life and writings,
*To act as a repository for Thoreauviana and material relevant to Thoreau,
*And to advocate for the preservation of Thoreau Country.

== Members==

Thoreau Society members represent a wide range
of professions, interests, and hometowns across
the United States and around the [[world]]. They are connected
by the conviction that Henry Thoreau had
important things to say and crucial questions to
ask that are just as significant in our time as in his.

Through its programs, publications and projects,
The Thoreau Society is committed to exploring
Thoreau's observations on living with self, society
and nature, and encouraging people to think about
how they live their own lives.

==Activities==

===Annual Gathering===
Four days of indoor and outdoor sessions and excursions in and around Concord focused on a different theme each year. The Thursday–Sunday program is scheduled in early July.

===Educational Programs===
Lectures, classes, and performances in Thoreau's hometown of Concord, often in collaboration with other historical, literary, environmental and educational organizations. An educational DVD, "Life With Principle," is available for high school and adult audiences with a full accompanying curriculum and related workshops.

'''Visual Arts Scotland''' ('''VAS''') is a registered charity (No. SC006715) based in [[Leith]], [[Edinburgh]], [[Scotland]] representing approximately 500 fine and applied [[visual artist]]s throughout the country.

==History==
In the year of 1924, William McDougall founded the Scottish Society of Women Artists due to the fact that his daughter, Lily McDougall, was a talented painter and could not be recognised simply because she was a woman. In the early 20th century, women didn't have the ability to gain acknowledgment for their artistic skills because it was male dominant. William McDougall created this organisation to give women the opportunity to expand their artistic horizons and to encourage them to continue with their artistic ventures. This organisation lasted until the late 1980s when it was reformed due to the changing times. It was called the Scottish Artists and Artist Craftsmen.  Alison Dunlop RSW was President of the Society in 1997-99, when it was re-named Visual Arts Scotland.  This organisation has various and diverse artists from across the country as its members&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.visualartsscotland.org/history/|publisher=Visual Arts Scotland|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Louise Gibson Annand]], twice President of the Scottish Society of Women Artists (1963–6 and 1980–5)

The '''Yulin Caves''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|榆|林|窟}}|p=Yulin kū}}) is a Buddhist cave temple site in [[Guazhou County]], [[Gansu Province]], China. The site is located some 100&amp;nbsp;km east of the oasis town of [[Dunhuang]] and the [[Mogao Caves]]. It takes its name from the [[eponym]]ous [[elm]] trees lining the Yulin River, which flows through the site and separates the two cliffs from which the caves have been excavated. The forty-two caves house some 250 [[polychrome]] statues and 4,200 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of wall paintings, dating from the [[Tang Dynasty]] to the [[Yuan Dynasty]] (seventh to fourteenth centuries).&lt;ref name="Fan"&gt;{{cite book |title=安西榆林窟 The Anxi Yulin Grottoes |editor=Fan Jinshi |language=Chinese, English |publisher=Gansu National Publishing House |isbn=7542106465 |year=1999 |pages=6–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Yulin"&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:安西榆林窟 |trans-title=Anxi Yulin Caves |language=Chinese |editor=[[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Academy]] |publisher=文物出版社 |year=1997 |isbn=7501007748}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site was among the first to be designated for protection in 1961 as a [[Major Site Protected for Its Historical and Cultural Value at the National Level|Major National Historical and Cultural Site]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/96/InfoID/16/frtid/134/Default.aspx |title=国务院关于公布第一批全国重点文物保护单位名单的通知 (1st Designations) |date=3 April 1961 |publisher=[[State Administration of Cultural Heritage]] |language=Chinese |accessdate=27 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609132452/http://www.sach.gov.cn/tabid/96/InfoID/16/frtid/134/Default.aspx |archivedate=June 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Yulin Grottoes were submitted for future inscription on the [[UNESCO World Heritage List]] as part of the Chinese Section of the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/5335/ |title=Chinese Section of the Silk Road |publisher=[[UNESCO]] |accessdate=28 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Caves==
Most of the caves take the form of an entrance corridor, antechamber, and main chamber. In three caves, a central pier was left intact during excavation then carved with niches on all four sides. A number of caves were reworked and repainted in later periods, since the site remained in use throughout the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]], [[Five Dynasties]], [[Song Dynasty|Song]], [[Western Xia]], and [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] Dynasties. It fell into disuse during the [[Ming Dynasty]]. There were early efforts to restore the caves at the time of the [[Qing Dynasty]] and several new caves also date to this period. More recently, under the management of the [[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Academy]], the focus has been on [[preventive conservation]] through [[Geotechnical engineering|consolidation]] of the cliff face and [[Tourism in China|controlling access]].&lt;ref name="Fan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Whitfield"/&gt;

==Wall paintings==
The paintings are [[Buddhist Art|Buddhist]] with some secular scenes, the former including [[buddhas]], [[bodhisattvas]], [[apsara]], and [[jataka tales]]; and the latter, [[donor portrait]]s, [[Go (game)|go]] players, representatives of [[Ethnic minorities in China|China's ethnic minorities]], marked out by their hair styles and dress, farming scenes such as milking a cow, wine-making, a smelting furnace, and a marriage ceremony; depictions of musicians and dancers help break down the distinction between the sacred and the profane.&lt;ref name="Fan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yulin"/&gt; The paintings are not [[frescoes]] but instead executed on an earthen [[Plaster|render]] with mineral and organic [[pigments]] and [[Natural gum|gum]] or [[Animal glue|glue]] [[Binder (material)|binders]].&lt;ref name="Whitfield"&gt;{{cite book |title=Cave Temples of Mogao: Art and History on the Silk Road |author=Whitfield, Roderick (''et al.'') |publisher=[[Getty Conservation Institute]] |year=2000 |isbn=0892365854 |pages=5, 114 ff, 135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of caves==
The forty-two caves are dated as follows, based largely on the [[Style (visual arts)|style]] of the paintings and their accompanying [[Epigraphy|inscriptions]] (in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Tibetan languages|Tibetan]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Tangut language|Tangut]], and [[Old Uighur language|Old Uighur]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |script-title=zh:安西榆林窟 |trans-title=Anxi Yulin Caves |language=Chinese |editor=[[Mogao Caves|Dunhuang Academy]] |publisher=文物出版社 |year=1997 |isbn=7501007748 |pages=254–263}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://hirosaki-u.academia.edu/DaiMatsui/Papers/1436663/Revising_the_Uigur_Inscriptions_of_the_Yulin_Caves |title=Revising the Uigur Inscriptions of the Yulin Caves |author=Dai Matsui |journal=Studies on the Inner Asian Languages  |issn=1341-5670 |publisher=[[Osaka University]] |year=2008 |volume=23 |pages=17–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;
